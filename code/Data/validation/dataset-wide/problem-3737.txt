Let $D$ be the unit disc in the complex plane and $P$ the Bergman projection mapping $L^2(D)$ onto the closed subspace $A^2(D)$ of holomorphic square-integrable functions (w.r.t. Lebesgue measure). Let $g$ be a bounded function on $D$. Is it possible for the operator $Tf:=(1-P)(gf)$, mapping $A^2(D)$ into its orthogonal, to be invertible? If this can happen, are there reasonable sufficient condition on $g$? Since $P(gf)=gf$ if $g$ is holomorphic, this can happen only for non-holomorphic functions. Notice that an easy calculation with $g(z)=\overline{z}$ reveals that $T$ is not invertible in this case. The question mark in the title is due to the fact that I am not sure about the terminology "Hankel" operators. 

A few years ago I first read about the marvelous Euler identity: $\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}}p(n)z^n=\prod_{k\geq1}\frac{1}{1-z^k}$, where $p(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ ($p(0)=1$ by convention) and some of its beautiful consequences (like the pentagonal number theorem). Taking log of both sides of Euler identity and differentiating, the following nice recursive formula magically appears: $np(n)=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}p(k)\sigma(n-k)$, where $\sigma(n)$ denotes the sum of the divisors of $n$. After some googling I found this identity quoted in a few places, but always without any reference. Since I am quite ignorant about the theory of partitions and related matters, I would like very much to know: 1) Who discovered this identity? Does it have a name? and the much more interesting: 2) Is there a proof without generating functions? Thank you! 

Let's say I want to prove that a closed subgroup of GL(n,R) or GL(n,C) is a Lie group, with an atlas given by exponential of matrices (restricted to an appropriate subalgebra of gl(n)), without using any manifold or Lie theory. Can you provide the necessary argument? Maybe it's trivial, but I can't see it at the moment. 

I would like to study/understand the (complete) classification of compact lie groups. I know there are a lot of books on this subject, but I'd like to hear what's the best route I can follow (in your opinion, obviously), since there are a lot of different ideas involved. 

If $R$ and $S$ are two equivalence relations on a set $X$ of card. $n$, we say that they are equivalent if there exists a bijection $\varphi:X\rightarrow X$ such that: $\varphi(x)R\varphi(y)\quad\iff\quad xSy$ Then the partition function $n$ is counting the number of equivalence relations on $X$ modulo this identification. 

Gelfand-Naimark structure theorem for $C^* $ algebras gives a canonical isometric * isomorphism between any commutative unital $C^* $ algebra $A$ and the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on $A$^. This is the spectrum (or structure space) of $A$, i.e. the non-zero multiplicative linear continuous functionals with the topology of pointwise convergence (alias weak*), which is compact and hausdorff. Apart from the easy case $A = C(X)$, with $X$ compact hausdorff, for which $A$^ is $X$ itself, there are a lot of non trivial and not immediately visible examples of spectra, for example: If $X$ loc. compact hausdorff $A = C_b(X)$ (continuous and bounded functions with uniform topology) is a $C^*$ algebra. If X is non compact then A^ cannot be $X$ and is in fact $\beta X$, the Stone-Cech compactification of $X$. If $X$ is loc. compact hausdorff and you take $C_0(X)$, then you get another compactification of $X$. If instead you simply take $C(X)$ for $X$ compact non-hausdorff you get a natural "hausdorfization" of $X$. I'm particularly interested in the existence of other constructions which can be described by gelfand theory as above. I mean to associate functorially to each space (in an appropriate subcategory of Top, maybe not full) a $C^*$ algebra and then to look at its spectra. A related question: what are the spectra of $L^\infty(R)$, and similar algebras (maybe $L^\infty(G)$, G loc. compact group with haar measure)? 

$L^p$ boundedness (for $p\in(1,+\infty)$) of your discrete Riesz transform can be derived applying De Leeuw's theorem (Theorem 3.8 in Chapter VII of Introduction to Fourier Analysis on Euclidean Spaces by E. Stein). The multiplier $m(\xi):=\frac{\xi_i}{|\xi|}$ gives rise to a bounded operator on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ ($p$ as above) by classical singular integral theory (or the Mihlin-Hormander multiplier theorem) and hence $b:=m_{|\mathbb{Z}^n}$ gives a bounded operator on $L^p(\mathbb{T}^n)$. De Leeuw's theorem is a particular instance of the phenomenon of transference (see $URL$ for this). 

A topological group $G$ is said to satisfy the Leptin condition if for every compact subset $K\subseteq G$ and for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists a compact subset $L$ such that $\mu(LK)$ < $ (1+\epsilon)\mu(L)$ where $\mu$ is Haar measure (I'm assuming $G$ locally compact hausdorff). It is known that the Leptin condition is equivalent to amenability, a very different looking property concerning the existence of an invariant mean on the group. How can one prove that nilpotent lie groups satisfy the Leptin condition without passing through amenability? For example $\mathbb{R}^n$ almost trivially satisfies such condition, even if proving amenability is harder. Thanks in advance! 

If I remember well, Introduction to topological manifolds (Lee) proves the classification theorem for 1-dim manifolds. 

I think you can find a proof that the differentiable topological degree is the (co)homological degree in the book by Bott and Tu (Diffrential forms in algebraic topology). But there instead of homology they describe cohomology first. Then you need to translate everything to the homological setting (by de Rham isomorphism). 

Let me premise that I am in no way an expert in the subject of this question. Let's say we have a measure space $X$ with measure $m$ and a reasonable notion of perimeter for (nice enough) subsets of $X$. We denote $p(F)$ the perimeter of $F\subseteq X$. I am interested in knowing classes of spaces for which the following property (P) holds: (P) There is a constant $C<+\infty$ such that given any subset $F$ (nice enough) and any natural number $K$, we can split $F$ in disjoint pieces $F_1,\dots,F_K$ such that $m(F_j)\leq C \frac{m(F)}{K}$ and $p(F_j)\leq Cp(F)$ for any $j=1,\dots,K$. Here nice enough may refer to having finite measure and perimeter and maybe some boundedness/compactness assumption. Of course the question (if it is not stupid, because of some gross misunderstanding on my part) sounds absurdly vague, so let me point out that it seems to me that the property holds on euclidean spaces. If $F\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ one can cut $F$ using parallel hyperplanes in $K$ pieces having exactly $1/K$ of the total volume and everything should work with constant $C=1$. I am especially interested in the graph case, i.e. $X=(V,E)$ is a (say countable and bounded-degree) graph with counting measure on vertices and perimeter of a subset $F$ measured by the number of edges connecting $F$ with its complement. Is $(P)$ a reasonable property? Are there interesting examples/counterexamples in the graph realm? 

I realized that one very fundamental geometric constraint on the underlying manifold of a Lie group which wasn't mentioned is that every such manifold is parallelizable, i.e. the tangent bundle is globally trivial. This is very easily seen by choosing a basis for the tangent space at the identity and moving it around with group translations. This, together with the "hairy ball theorem" gives you the non-existence of lie group structures on even dimensional spheres ($\dim>0$). 

To expand on Douglas Zare comment, the problem is that the identity $\hat{f''}(\xi)=-\xi^2\hat{f}(\xi)$ holds only for regular functions (say Schwartz functions). By duality you can extend this to distributions. So the identity holds for your function $f$, but you have to consider its distributional second derivative $f''$, which is $g$ plus some Dirac deltas and derivates of Dirac deltas supported on $\{-1,+1\}$. These corrections account for the non zero value at the origin of $\hat{g}$. 

Expanding on the first part of Daniel Spector's comment, in all the cases you mentioned there is a canonical inclusion $\mathbb{Z}\hookrightarrow X$ for a certain set $X$ (reals, polynomials with complex coefficients, etc. ). When we write $\sqrt{n}$ for $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ (or any analogous expression), you are doing a little abuse of notation, identifying $n$ with its image under the canonical embedding of $\mathbb{Z}$ into the reals (or the appropriate set $X$). This usually doesn't cause any ambiguity and that's why we do it all the time. 

A basic phenomenon in the direction of your question is the following. If $\hat{f}(\xi)e^{C |\xi|}$ ($C<+\infty$) is integrable, then $f$ has a holomorphic extension to the strip of width $C$ around the $x$-axis. As a consequence, the Taylor series of $f$ converges on an interval of radius $C$ around each point. One can generalize this to several variables. 

Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a Lie sub-algebra of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Is there a name for the smallest ideal of $\mathfrak{g}$ containing $\mathfrak{m}$? It certainly exists and coincides with the intersection of all the ideals containing $\mathfrak{m}$. The analogy with normal closure in group theory would suggest "ideal closure", but I don't remember having seen this terminology before. 

I add that there are a lot of manifolds which does not admit a Lie group structure. A nice obstruction is that the fundamental group should be abelian. This is true even for topological groups. So there's no way to put a topological group structure on surfaces of genus higher than 1. This can be easily understood by inspection of the map $\gamma(t)\sigma(r)$ for $\gamma$ and $\sigma$ two loops based at the identity. An obstruction in the smooth category (if I remember correctly) is the fact that if $H^1(G)$ is trivial than $H^3(G)$ must be non trivial (maybe $\dim G>0$), showing that $S^0$, $S^1$ and $S^3\cong SU^2$ are the only spheres which can be lie groups. They are the units of the only associative division algebras over the reals. 

I suspect, as Daniel Spector said, that to find a characterization of Holder continuity in terms of Fourier coefficients is very hard. A nice necessary condition is a theorem by Bernstein asserting that if $f$ is $\alpha$-Holder for $\alpha>\frac{1}{2}$ then its Fourier coefficients are in $\ell^1(\mathbb{Z})$ (see Katznelson "An introduction to harmonic analysis" for a proof). 

If Fourier series of continuous functions would converge in $L^\infty$, then, by the Uniform Boundedness Principle, the operator norms in $C(\mathbb{T})$ of the partial Fourier series operators $S_Nf(t):=\sum_{n=-N}^N\hat{f}(n)e^{int}$ would be uniformly bounded. You can find, for example in Katznelson book, a proof of the fact that such norms diverge logarithmically. 

Chow's theorem is the statement that if $M$ is a connected smooth manifold endowed with a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ which is completely non integrable (i.e. iterated commutators of smooth sections of $\mathcal{D}$ generate the full tangent bundle $TM$), then any pair of points $x,y\in M$ may be connected by a piecewise smooth horizontal curve $\gamma$, i.e. a curve such that $\gamma'(t)\in \mathcal{D}_{\gamma(t)}$ for every $t$. The converse statement (every pair of points can be connected by horizontal curves implies that the distribution is completely non integrable) is false in general and holds under an additional assumption of analyticity (of $M$ and $\mathcal{D}$). I need to use this fact in a paper and I realized I do not know of any place where one can find a proof (or probably I have a bad memory). Do you know of any citable source?
