It is easy to see that every Caley graph satisfies this. To enumerate such a graph, proceed by induction and keep the following condition satisfied at each step: If $X$ is the set of vertices enumerated so far, then $X$ is a connected graph and $V\setminus X$ does not have finite connected components. The first condition ensures that the last enumerated vertex is adjacent to at least one enumerated earlier. The second condition implies that $V\setminus X$ does not have isolated points, so the next enumerated vertex will be connected to something not yet enumerated. Assume that these conditions are satisfied, and pick a vertex $a\in V\setminus X$, connected to $X$, that you would like to be numbered. If $V\setminus (X\cup a)$ does not have finite connected components, just assign the next available number to $a$. Otherwise let $Y\subset V$ be the union of these finite components and $a$. Clearly $Y$ is a connected graph. Let us first enumerate everything in $Y\setminus a$, then we will be able to assign the next number to $a$. It suffices to find a vertex $y\in Y\setminus a$ such that (1) $y$ is adjacent to something in $X$; and (2) $Y\setminus y$ is connected. (Once such $y$ is found, assign it the next number and repeat the procedure until $Y\setminus a$ is exhausted.) If $Y$ is biconnected (i.e. does not not lose connectedness after removal of any vertex), then any $y\in Y\setminus A$ which is adjacent to something in $X$ works. And such $y$ exists due to the "no single-point boundary" property applied to $Y\setminus a$. If $Y$ is not biconnected, consider its biconnected components. They are arranged to a tree. Take a leaf node of this tree, i.e. a biconnected component which contains only one cut vertex. If a leaf component contains $a$, choose another one (there at least two leaf nodes in any nontrivial tree). Let $Z$ be this leaf component and $b$ its cut vertex. Now the same argument as above, applied to $Z$ and $b$ in place of $Y$ and $a$, yields that a desired vertex $y$ exists in $Z\setminus b$. Thus any vertex $a$ adjacent to something in $X$ can be handled after finitely many steps. Since the graph is connected, this allows us to enumerate everything. 

Here is a formalization of Andr√© Henriques' answer to the Hausdorff dimension variant of the question. Let $K=\{0,1\}^\infty$ be the standard Cantor set. Define a map $f:K\to[0,1]$ as follows: for a binary sequence $x=x_1x_2\dots\in K$, let $f(x)$ be the real number with binary representation $0.x_2x_4x_6\dots$ (or, equivalently, $f(x)=\sum x_{2k}2^{-k}$). The pre-image of every point of $[0,1]$ contains a subset of $K$ where the even-numbered digits are fixed and odd-numbered ones are arbitrary. Now embed $K$ as a subset of $[0,1]$ and use your favorite extension theorem to extend $f$ to a map from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$. The pre-images could only get larger. The Hausdorff dimensions of pre-images of course depend on how you represent $K$ as a subset of $[0,1]$. Consider a self-similar Cantor set defined by a parameter $\alpha<\frac12$, namely $K$ is a union of two disjoint subsets homothetic to $K$ with coefficient $\alpha$. Then the distance in $K$ between binary sequences $x$ and $y$ is approximately $\alpha^{-n}$ where $n$ is the first position where the sequences diverge. Now we can estimate the dimension of pre-images as follows. Consider a map $g:K\to[0,1]$ defined by $g(x_1x_2\dots)=0.x_1x_3x_5\dots$ (base 2). For every $t\in[0,1]$, we have $g(f^{-1}(t))=[0,1]$. And $g$ is Holder with exponent $\beta=\frac12\log 2/\log(\alpha^{-1})$. A $\beta$-Holder map multiplies the Hausdorff dimension by at most $\beta^{-1}$, hence $\dim_H(f^{-1}(t))\ge\beta$. In this construction $\beta$ can be made arbitrarily close to 1/2. Making all pre-images of dimension exactly 1/2 requires more work. 

This is just Lipschitz structure: only locally Lipschitz maps preserve rectifiability of all curves. What is wrong with the $x\mapsto x^{1/3}$ map is explained in Tapio Rajala's answer. (A more explicit example is the path $t\mapsto t^2\sin(1/t)$, $t\in[0,1]$, and you can make a non self-overlapping example if you go to dimension 2). Here are the missing details of Tapio's answer in the general case. If a homeomorphism $f:U\to U$ is not Lipschitz on some compact set, then there exist sequences $x_n$ and $y_n$ converging to some $p\in U$ rapidly (e.g. such that $|x_n-p|<2^{-n}$ and $|y_n-p|<2^{-n}$) and such that $|f(x_n)-f(y_n)|>n^2|x_n-y_n|$. Consider a curve that oscillates between $x_n$ and $y_n$ approximately $(n^2|x_n-y_n|)^{-1}$ times, then goes to $x_{n+1}$ and oscillates between $x_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+1}$, and so on. It is rectifiable (its length is bounded above by something like $2\sum_n (n^{-2}+2^{-n})$) but its $f$-image is not: each oscillating part adds at least 1 to the length. 

No such a set is not always a polytope. Consider the convex hull of the set of points of the form $(1/n.1/n^2)$ and $(0,0)$ in $\mathbb R^2$. Its boundary is a union of infinitely many segments with rational directions. And all points not in the interiors of the segments are "vertices" where the Gauss map is not single-valued. 

I'm sure this is standard but I don't know where to look. Let $M$ be a contractible compact smooth $n$-manifold with boundary. Does it have to be homeomorphic to $D^n$? What about diffeomorphic? [UPDATE: the answer is well-known to be negative as many people kindly pointed out. But actually I assume more about the manifold, namely the following:] There is a Riemannian metric on $M$ such that every two points are connected by a unique shortest path. So $M$ can be contracted to a point $p\in M$ by sending every point along a shortest path to $p$. These paths can bend along the boundary and can merge because of this. But they are relatively nice (namely $C^{1,1}$) curves and their first derivatives depend continuously on their endpoints. Given all this, can one conclude that $M$ is a disc? ADDED: These curves are of course gradient curves of a function (the distance to $p$) which is $C^1$ and has no critical points in the interior of $M$, except at $p$. 

A group $G$ is Hopfian if every epimorphism $G\to G$ is an isomorphism. A smooth manifold is aspherical if its universal cover is contractible. Are all fundamental groups of aspherical closed smooth manifolds Hopfian? Perhaps the manifold structure is irrelevant and makes examples harder to construct, so here is another variant that may be more sensible. Let $X$ be a finite CW-complex which is $K(\pi,1)$. If it helps, assume that its top homology is nontrivial. Is $\pi=\pi_1(X)$ Hopfian? Motivation. Long ago I proved a theorem which is completely useless but sounds very nice: if a manifold $M$ has certain homotopy property, then the Riemannian volume, as a function of a Riemannian metric on $M$, is lower semi-continuous in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. (And before you laugh at this conclusion, let me mention that it fails for $M=S^3$.) The required homotopy property is the following: every continuous map $f:M\to M$ which induces an epimorphism of the fundamental group has nonzero (geometric) degree. This does not sound that nice, and I tried to prove that some known classes of manifolds satisfy it. My best hope was that all essential (as in Gromov's "Filling Riemannian manifolds") manifolds do. I could not neither prove nor disprove this and the best approximation was that having a nonzero-degree map $M\to T^n$ or $M\to RP^n$ is sufficient. I never returned to the problem again but it is still interesting to me. An affirmative answer to the title question would solve the problem for aspherical manifolds. A negative one would not, and in this case the next question may help (although it is probably stupid because I know nothing about the area): Question 2. Let $G$ be a finitely presented group and $f:G\to G$ an epimorphism. It it true that $f$ induces epimorphism in (co)homology (over $\mathbb Z$, $\mathbb Q$ or $\mathbb Z/2$)?
