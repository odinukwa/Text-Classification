It would be tough to answer this very directly, but it's safe to say that tens of thousands, and possibly up to a few hundred thousand head of cattle, may have been killed per year over many years. Here is an estimate of the growth in the longhorn cattle population of Alta California: 

The terms "God" and "supreme essence" strongly evoke an assumption of monotheism, which was absent from almost all civilizations prior to the rise of Christianity. For example in ancient Greece individual cities each had their own particular gods, which was quite typical of other ancient civilizations. The only major exceptions I'm aware of are Egypt under Akhenaten and Zorastrian Persia. 

There are some fragments of evidence in the book Time for Telling Truth is Running Out: Conversations with Zhang Shenfu. In the introduction, Vera Schwarcz describes her visit to a certain room in Zhang's house: 

The flow of information between British India and the UK during World War II depended mainly on telegrams and written correspondence carried by ship. Naval warfare around the UK itself probably had an indirect impact. With respect to the telegraphic infrastructure within India itself, the main threat was not Japan, but the Quit India movement. In 1942, rebels destroyed 332 railway stations and 945 post and telegraph offices. For more info see India's War by Srinath Raghavan. 

Here is an article that mentions a "universal decree requiring the face veil for Muslim women" which was supposedly imposed "around the time of the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt in the 13th century." 

The post-bellum South remained largely rural and homogenously Protestant, but not a thinly populated frontier. Here's a relevant summary of what unfolded within that geographical context from an article you may want to look at: 

During the nineteenth century, the Zanzibar Sultunate was gradually extending its reach into the interior, mainly via the Congo River. This process might have continued if it were not constrained by British and German interference. 

The first quote in the question is part of a longer quote from Albert Hourani included in the Wikipedia article on the spread of Islam. That same quote answers the question as follows: "In most cases worldly and spiritual motives for conversion blended together." But what does this mean exactly? As addressed in the question, tax policies probably don't explain much. The first paragraph of the article mentions that conversion to Islam was: 

Whatever the exact location was, the battle of Antioch was obviously a lot closer to Antioch than it was to the Dead Sea. The conquest of Antioch in 613 CE by the Persians was a decisive defeat for the Byzantines. From there, Persian/Sasanian forces quickly went on to conquer further into Palestine, including Jerusalem. The Persian Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia lays out these basic facts in several places. According to one of the articles linked to in the question, the Roman defeat described in the Quran was more then a decade later in 627 CE. True or not, this does not seem to refer to Antioch. 

There is no direct evidence that any Stalin-backed plot to kill Tito was ever really put into action. Tito claimed that several attempts were made to kill him and that Stalin was behind them, and Stalin did actually want for Tito to be assassinated. Several potential methods were discussed, but none were carried out. 

This worked fine as far as hyperinflation was concerned, but it was too little and too late to reverse the larger political and economic crisis. Germany was under increasing pressure to pay its war debts and a currency peg was unhelpful in that regard. Prices stabilized domestically, but faith in the government had been irreversibly shaken. Hitler's famous Beer Hall Putsch had taken place earlier that same month. 

Two ships, the Inez and Bethel were purchased together at San Francisco for the modest total sum of $450. By comparison the price of passage on a ship to San Francisco from New York around that time could be in the range of $100-$300 per ticket. To put this in context, a story from KQED radio outlines several historical reasons for the practice of abandoning ships amid the Gold Rush. 

In an article 1983, a legal scholar named Joyce Lee Malcolm mentions how little is known about this: 

Another article mentions some extension of electrical lines (but not generative capacity) as a partial exception to the overall decline. It also includes the following graph which shows the overall relative decline in infrastructural investment very clearly. The dotted black line essentially shows that the value of South African infrastructure peaked in the 1980s. The dark and solid line is also relevant, showing that investment peaked earlier on. 

The overall decline of South African infrastructure is an ongoing trend that predates the rise of the ANC. A number of articles in the economic literature look at the data on this. Here is one that concludes: 

First, to be clear, lead is an additive and doesn't occur naturally in gasoline. It was in 1921 that General Motors discovered that adding lead (in the form of lead tetraethyl or TEL) to gasoline is a cheap way to increase octane and prevent engine knocking. So it would have been possible before that. Soon after, in 1925 and 1926, there was a temporary ban at the federal level lasting about a year. After that, adding lead was the standard practice. Federal restrictions on lead in gasoline were phased in gradually, starting in 1974 and completed by 1986. A key factor in moving away from lead was the introduction of catalytic converters, which would quickly be destroyed by leaded gasoline. Most of this is described in detail in "The Secret History of Lead", an article published by The Nation in 2000. So far I have found no evidence that lead-free gasoline was commercially available in California or any other state between May 1926 and 1974. EDIT: The article "The Rise and Fall of Organometallic Additives in Automotive Gasoline" tracks the unleaded offerings of American gasoline companies in detail. Although the following quotes would seem to contradict, they imply that some unleaded gasoline was always available, typically as a "premium" product: Sun and/or Amoco. 

The idea for the Century 21 exposition originated from within Seattle itself. "A defining moment in the history of Seattle, this fair began life as the brainchild of City Councilman Al Rochester." (source) To quote some other relevant details from Wikipedia: 

All human populations participate in one or more cultural groups regardless of whether they are part of a civilization. 

To clarify the second point a bit, a merchant's conversion to Islam could improve their access to trading opportunities. Certain trading ports might allow special privileges to Muslims, and individual Muslim traders might prefer to do businesses with other Muslims. A few points raised elsewhere in the article: 

It's a big question, so I'll mostly just point you to some sources that would help you develop a more complete answer. The main point I would emphasize is that the whole concept of "stay at home mother" is a very modern one. Through most of US history, it was taken for granted that (at least for white women) motherhood was a full time occupation. Until World War Two, only a small minority of mothers were employed outside their own households. Overall between 1800 and 1900, female labor force participation in the United States is not estimated to have exceeded 20% (see the last page of this student paper). This temporarily dipped below 15% around 1860-1870 (possibly because slave women were "unemployed" by Emancipation?). Industrialization and urbanization gradually created a demand for female labor, but the traditional association between women and domesticity didn't change very quickly. In the 1800s, women were largely excluded from most jobs but dominated in a few: elementary school teachers, dressmakers and domestic servants. World War Two famously made it more socially acceptable for women to work in other kinds of jobs (think Rosy the Riveter). For more detailed analysis of long-term employment patterns measured in US Census data, including female employment and its variations over time and between regions and occupations, see the article "Labor Force and Employment, 1800—1960" by Stanley Lebergott. 

During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in certain parts of Europe (most notably the Netherlands) hemp was widely grown as an industrial crop, but tobacco was a relatively expensive import. So the amount of tobacco smoked was probably small in comparison to cannabis. Smoking in general was disreputable, possibly even more so in the case of tobacco since it was more exotic and poorly understood. So why did tobacco come to dominate the market? Tobacco, like a lot of things, would have become much cheap and abundant over the course of the nineteenth century due to colonialism, the steamship, etc. Then prohibition in the twentieth century made cannabis expensive and illegal. 

According to the Wikipedia article linked to in the question, the mutineers on Pitcairn were isolated from outside contact for less than 20 years (1790-1808). There have been countless small societies isolated from outside contact for centuries at a time. A notable example are the Sentinelese in the Andaman islands, who may have been isolated for as long as 60,000 years. As for island castaways, the Pitcairn islanders might be a unique case. However here's an interesting detail from a Wikipedia article about Saint Helena: 

This is very doubtful. There were other Roman festivals in which women did have a special role, such as Caprotinia in July and Bona Dea in December. Although there were other various Roman festivals in late February and early March, I can find no evidence of a link to International Women's Day. Jewish The Russian article quoted above further claims, in much more detail, that there was an association between the origins of International Women's Day and the Jewish festival of Purim. Purim does occasionally fall on March 8, and some modern Jews embrace the coincidence. But the Russian article explicitly (and falsely) states that socialist activist Clara Zetkin scheduled Women's Day to fall on Purim. A Jewish site attributes this claim to "Andrei Kurayev, an anti-Semitic archdeacon of the Russian Orthodox Church", but I'm unable to verify this. Persian Sepandārmazgān is an ancient holiday with relevant associations to women, although it is more generally thought of as a day of love. A modern calendar introduced in 1925 set the date at calendar February 24. Some early celebrations of International Women's Day were in late February. This might be worth some further investigation, but is probably coincidental. 

You may find the field of "big history" relevant to your interests. David Christian's book Maps of Time is an excellent introduction. This work isn't as quantitatively oriented as what you are looking for, but you may still find it useful. (As an aside, I can't resist echoing the warning tweeted by Neil DeGrass Tyson: "In science, when human behavior enters the equation, things go nonlinear. That's why Physics is easy and Sociology is hard.") 

There is evidence to suggest that many were manufactured, but were not actually purchased for normal use. As described in an article on the use of American flags in popular fashion: 

Ancient religions don't generally have technical names, at least not at the civilizational level. Think "Ancient Greek religion", "Ancient Egyptian religion", etc. Here is a technical article summarizing what little is known about Phoenician religion (as of 1990 anyway). It is aptly titled "Phoenician Religion" and does not offer a general alternative term.
