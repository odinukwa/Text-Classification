My question is, have any Buddhist thinkers responded to this critique of Buddhism? Note that I don't want answerers to try responding to the critique themselves (which might lead to too much speculation and arguments). I'm just interested in whether any published works have responded to it. By the way, the aphorisms of the Brahma Sutras are somewhat cryptic, so their meaning and justification are usually understood with the help of commentaries, like this one and this one. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank You in Advance. EDIT: Here is a book about the Brahma Sutras' critique of the Vedanta school. 

Most of the actions come from an intention. If you were walking listening to music and looking around and you happen to step on a cockroach, then its not bad karma for you, because you never knew a cockroach would be there nor you saw it before you took that footstep. But if you were walking in the path knowing there are cockroaches and there is a chance that you step on one but still you continue to walk carelessly and suddenly you step on a cockroach, then it is bad karma. This is because it is ignorance. True that you did not meant to step on one, yet you stepped. You walked carelessly knowing there is a chance that another living being could be harmed if you are not careful. But you continued to do so anyway and it harmed a living being. That is a sin. 

from my experience, I dont make meditation more difficult than what it has to be.. i would watch my breathing like a curious scientist watches things on his slide via microscope. it is quite pleasant for me 

more like contemplating rather chanting. origination or dependent arising, Prat카tyasamutp훮da. He told Ananda he would contemplate, recite Prat카tyasamutp훮da when he was alone. 

hmmm here is a free book. it has about 40+ sutta of a stream enterer (none-contradict each other whatsoever. We buddhists want to know if we have achieved this level of dharma. Buddha allowed us to proclaim ourselves so and here is the tool. $URL$ I remember a sutta from pali cannon where this rich merchant invited buddha to receive meal at his mansion in a week. later a king or prince desperately wanted buddha to come eat at his place on the same day (i dont recall why). Buddha said he couldnt change the reservation without consent from this merchant because he invited him first. So buddha sent ven Moggallana to this merchant to see what he would think about moving the reservation to a week later. the marchant would agree if ven Moggallana could confirm 4 (or maybe 5) things 1) would he still be alive ? answer was yes. 2) would buddha still be alive? yes. 3) would he still have his wealth? yes. 4) would he still have the unshakable confidence in buddha? ven Moggallana did not answer the last question citing that this was something the merchant had the ability to answer that himself. finally he agreed to move the reservation to a week later. Point is, a confidence in buddha, dharma, sangha is one characteristic of a stream enterer. And Buddha was explicit that only him and yourself can make such a claim. How common is it? Buddha said in one sutta, plenty. not 10, 100, 1000+ as long as 8 fold path is practiced, world is not going to be absent of an arayan (those who is a stream enterer or higher. perfectly good word ruined by Nazi). also compare to another sutta, he compared dust on his finger tips to the entire earth as reference to numbers of Arayans compare to all other beings (seen and unseen) so the ratio would be large! read the book and ask yourself. only you can proclaim yourself .. 

For the first two situations, the way you will pay for these may and may not happen like an mirror image of what you did. Mostly likely it won't. Because that is not the only Karma you have with you. You have previous good karma and bad karma. So the good and the bad karma will determine how you pay for each one. 

The third precept says to refrain from sexual misconduct. So assuming your partners are aware of the polygamous nature in your relationship but if one or all of them happened to be spouses of another individual (or happened to be in a relationship), then you are violating the 3rd of the 5 precepts as you have caused adultery. You would immediately ask me why? Well it is because, although you wont hurt your partners, the other partners of your partners does not know it. They are deceived. Therefore that is a sin. It is true that your partners made that choice of getting into the polygamous relationship with you ignoring their spouses or boyfriend/girlfriend. In this scenario, your partners will commit a sin for deceiving their spouse or the person with the relationship, and you will face the karma of committing adultery because you knew they were married/engaged/in a relationship. 

Kashmiri Shaivism is a sect of Hinduism that used to be popular in the Kashmir region of India. Now this excerpt from the Paramarthasara Vivriti, a work by the 11th century Kashmiri Shaivite philosopher Yogaraja, discusses the delusion that arises from confusing that which is Self from that which is not Self: 

This is a long-standing mystery, described in many Zen Koans. Here are two Koans from the Gateless Gate that mentions it: 

Ignoring cultural beliefs and traditions and thinking in terms of pure Buddhism, it can be a sin and at the same time can not be a sin. Polyamory is not a sin if both your partners knows what is exactly happening and both of them know that you are in a polyamory. Hence if either of the partners do not like it, they have a choice to leave. You have been honest. If you mention to both of your partners that you are monogamous yet you continue the polygamous relationship, then you are deceiving both of your partners ( because each of them thinks they are the only one you have). This is a sin. Assuming one day both of them find out that you did, then you have caused pain and anger to both of your partners, that is also a sin. Take a look at the 5 precepts: 

yes. Many in pali cannon have achieved stream enterer without mediation. when sariputtra (Buddha's chief decipher) was a lay person.. he met A monk Elder Assaji. He was so impressed with monk's demeanor, he asked him who was his teacher and what were his teachings. Ven. Assaji, said he was new to this monastic life and could not explain the teaching in detail but in short.. "Of all those things that from a cause arise, Tathagata the cause thereof has told; And how they cease to be, that too he tells, This is the doctrine of the Great Recluse" Sariputtri achieved stream enterer right then and there. Buddha's gave about 50+ suttas about the characteristic of a stream enterer. Another story, Lady Visakha achieved stream enterer when she was 7 when she heard Buddha's teaching (something like, "small faults in others are easy to see but big faults in yourself are difficult to notice" ) 

As long as you are a normal human, you have many things to give, which money cannot buy such as simple act of kindness. For example: 

Lord Buddha himself said that karma is like a ripple effect. Let's assume you killed the person A by firing a bullet through the forehead. So in direct terms, you should also be fired a bullet through your head. But it may and may not happen. Let me tell you why. Now when you killed that person A. There is a chance that you caused these effects on him : 

here is a book about sotapanna with citations $URL$ Free download so no breaking of second precept :-) 

I agree with enenalan. i dont remember from what sutta. it was something like, when one wants to be somewhere, The desire to get there is ceased once you have reached your destination. Interestingly, in Buddha's first sermon, one of the causes of suffering (or stress -dhukka) is "craving for non-becoming or vibhava-tanha" . in all pali cannons, Buddha mentioned "craving for non-becoming" only once in his 40+ years of teaching. this, i suspect, is the last cause for suffering one has to abandon to become enlightened. Those who reached this point is called anagami. Please let me know if anyone ever heard " craving for non-becoming or vibhava tanha" mentioned in any other sutta besides the Dhammacakkappavattana. I would greatly appreciate it. 

Now you have caused person A's family a lot of heart breaks. Imagine, because of that person A's death, his spouse and children have no way of earning money and gets mentally weakened. The children do not get proper education nor the guidance. So the children end up drug addicts. Now the children are addicted to drugs and they grow up and commit murders to find money for drugs. Person A's parents die in terrible sadness and shock because of their sons murder. This is why the Karma is like the ripple effect, it follows a lot of things. Hence you ignored the consequences of your actions to the people around and you just shot person A in cold blood. Now the sins you pay will be determined by these things. 

There are sufferings that parents cannot help. I dont remember from what sutta but it goes something like , parents cannot help a child to be free from sufferings that caused by illness, aging, and death. If your family wants to be free from these universal sufferings, they have to practice dhamma. No other ways around it. Anyone or any being that has name and form (Nama-rupa) experieces sufferings, period. Suffering ends when nama-rupa ends. (those who achieve enlightenment still experience physical pain while they still have the body) nothing you can do to eliminate those sufferings for them. Best you can do is tell them Dhamma taught by Buddha.
