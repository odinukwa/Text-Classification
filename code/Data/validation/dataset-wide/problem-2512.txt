But it might be easy to read an English translation like "self-view" or "self-identification", and assume it's talking all about the self. Instead it may be talking mostly about the aggregates, i.e. "wrong to view the aggregates as self". Perhaps it ought to be called "a wrong view of aggregates". 

It might be difficult for you to get them to think about their stupid actions. For example if you say, "your actions are stupid, you should think about them", then they might be averse to listening. It might be easier to talk to them about your stupid actions: 

So people tend to refer to dukkha instead of the English word "suffering", and/or understand that "suffering" is a reference to dukkha and not necessarily used e.g. in the English sense (where it's used in the Christian canon extensively, to refer to crucifixion for example, among other references). 

I suppose the "life is terminated" earlier: when the eggs are taken from the fish (prematurely), or when the eggs are refrigerated (I think that eggs, fish eggs too, need warmth to keep growing). This may be more of a question about biology than Buddhism though ... so perhaps ask it on Biology.SE or Vegetarianism.SE ... I don't know that there's any answer that's specific to Buddhism. 

Beware that although I tried to answer this I know even less about Mahayana doctrines and terminology than I do about the Pali suttas, i.e. this is my opinion and liable to be ignorant. 

Perhaps you're thinking of various words which are translated as "mind" or "consciousness". I think it's said that the mind is aware of thoughts -- or if not "mind" then "consciousness of mental activity" ... in the same way that "eye consciousness" is aware of sights, and "ear consciousness" is of sounds. Western philosophy has theories like "I think, therefore I am"; but I think that Buddhist doctrine includes statements such as, "I am not these thoughts, these thoughts are not mine, and are not me." Because you're constantly aware of them, though (in the same way that a dog who is tied to a post will be constantly aware of the post), you might be inclined to view them as "me". 

In the answers to How are 'conceit' and 'identity-view' not the same? people said that "comparing" is a symptom of "conceit" ... and that conceit is one of the very last fetters (I won't try to explain that now). But I think it's worth noting that "conceit" seems to be explicitly identified as essential, in one of the suttas, the Bhikkhuni Sutta: 

I'm not sure it's right to call them "mutually exclusive" either, though maybe you can't consciously practice all of them simultaneously. Imagine there was some old inscription, faded by centuries, on rock or wood, difficult to read. To try to read it you might illuminate it from one side, to try to see the shadow of the letters ... then illuminate it from the other side, to see a different shadow of the same letters. 

It's also mentioned in one of the OP's books (How Mindfulness Meditation Works: A Modern Buddhist View): 

Unfortunately, the belief that a ritual has a magical power might be a "fetter", if I've understood that right. See for example Three fetters; or this description of Five lower fet­ters which includes, 

The "polarity" of existence versus non-existence takes several forms -- all the undeclared questions moe-or-less belong to that category: Does the Tathagata exist after death? Is the cosmos eternal, is it infinite? Are body and soul the same? So far as I know perhaps the only "right view" is defined by the four noble truths, concerning the origin and cessation of stress, consequently every other view is wrong view. You might argue that anicca and anatta are right views too, but maybe anicca and anatta are better seen as further examples of wrong view, i.e. the view that things are permanent is "wrong", and views about self are also "wrong". Having a thicket of views isn't the same thing as cessation of stress; and when you're supposed to be concentrating on some other activity, holding views like "I exist" or "I don't exist" are examples of attending inappropriately. 

I don't understand these arguments well enough to argue them myself: I could only quote them. If you want to question one of these arguments, try posting that as a new question tagged tibetan-buddhism. 

At the end of the Maha-Rahulovada Sutta (MN 62) and in the Anapanasati Sutta (MN 118) there's a description of several types (or objects) of mindfulness, which lists "sixteen steps" (grouped into four tetrads) to be mindful of (or, it says that "he trains himself") during in-and-out breathing. In Chapter 8 ("Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects") of the Visuddhimagga are two dozen pages of commentary which explain the above in more detail. This commentary says, in summary: 

There's a status called Anagarika, which isn't a monk and allows the handling of money (I don't know whether that includes earning/possessing money, or whether it is only handling monetary donations e.g. for the benefit of the monastery). 

The sutta lists links of dependent origination, backwards. So I'd read it as "With existence as condition, birth. With birth as condition, suffering. With suffering as condition, faith." I expect it means faith in the four noble truths, for example: i.e. because of (conditioned by) suffering you agree with the noble truths (including the first noble truth), and develop confidence in the Buddha's teaching. Note that suffering is the end or final result of samsara ... and faith is the beginning or first step towards liberation. So this sutta lists two sequences of links (the conditions of suffering and the conditions of liberation), and links the two together there. There is a longer article on the sutta here, which talks about how faith arises, and a shorter one here. You might possibly be confused by the term "supporting condition": other translations may include "proximate condition", "requisite condition", "prerequisite". 

The answer seems to be yes or no: depending on how you define "idolatry", and whether you consider the belief+intent or only the action+appearance. For example, Wikipedia says "yes", 

You might like to read those several pages from the Vinaya commentary in their entirety (instead of only the quotes above). Someone also wrote a commantary on the commentary, here: Vinaya Parajika 3 do not kill – accesstoinsight detailed commentary 

This is off-topic because it is later than "early" buddhism, but your question reminded me of the "10 bulls" illustrations (which are, if not early, at least famous, and use an emptiness to represent enlightenment). 

Still, maybe something analogous (i.e. practising virtue as an antidote for remorse and anxiety) is true for laypeople also. 

Whether or not it is the "root" cause, the implication of the suttas above is that if/when you can eradicate any one of them then you can break the chain or cycle. The corollary though, IMO, is that if a person indulges in or abides in any one, then they cause them all. The second noble truth explicitly warns against greed, but the 'three poisons' also warn against anger and ignorance. And it seems to me that lying is (except in vanishingly rare circumstances) intended to promote ignorance. A person who thinks they can lie successfully might think that they can 'get away with murder'. You ask, "Is it exaggerated?" IMO 'not lying' is also connected with Right Speech, with being able to share (true) Dharma, with not causing schism in the Sangha. 

I expect that mudita can be developed or brought into being by conscious meditation, i.e. people practice "metta-bhavana" meditation and you might presumably practice "mudita-bhavana" too. 

It means that there are various things you might view as yourself (e.g. "I am my body" or "I am my thoughts" or "I am my feelings" etc.), however any and all these views lead to suffering; and that the way to end suffering includes abandoning these views of self (all views of self). The most famous sutta on the subject is the Anatta-lakkhana Sutta, which says that the body leads to disease, and we can't say "Let my body be this was or not be that way". It says that if the body were self then we'd be able to control it, and that it's because it's not-self that we cannot (and so on for the other aggregates). It's therefore not proper (Pali kalla, also translated skillful, healthy, sound) to consider it self. My favourite (because I think it's the clearest) sutta on the subject is paragraph 23 of the The Discourse on the Snake Simile -- Alagaddupama Sutta (MN 22) (read the paragraphs before and after this one to get the context): 

So, my question here is, if eradication of the lower fetter of identity-view or belief in a self (sakkāya-diṭṭhi) is not the complete eradication of a self, then what is it really? I think it's no longer holding the view: neither for intellectual reasons, nor even for emotional reasons. I guess that "not holding the view for emotional reasons" may require some insight into (experience and diagnosis of) dukkha associated with self-view -- i.e. a reason not to hold self-view is that the view is unsatisfactory or conducive to suffering (and anatta is seen to be compatible or not incompatible with any self-interest so there's less or no emotional resistance to it). In other words, it's associated with seeing the three characteristics. It's also associated with vicikicchā, as you said. For completeness' sake, another possibility, another condition in which it may arise (i.e. an emotional willingness to consider a view in which yourself, body, isn't primary and central), is loving another as yourself -- perhaps the love experienced by a parent, or bodhicitta. Is it an intellectual understanding of not-self? Or is it more? Is it an opinion? Is it a belief? Is it an experience? I think it's an experience, of the three characteristics and of hearing the dhamma, and an intellectual understanding, and some (enough of an) emotional understanding. How is the eradication of the lower fetter of identity view different from total eradication of the sense of self? That was a topic of How are 'conceit' and 'identity-view' not the same? In summary I think that someone with self-view might have an experience and say, "this is self" -- note that in this way, as a result of this, the self-view is self-perpetuating. Conversely, without self-view you might have an experience (a thought, a feeling) and observe that "that was some conceit". 

I'm not sure whether the Vinaya rule is the same as "kamma", but I'd argue that psychosis may prevent intention and/or perception. In my country, an adult who is psychotic may be given a court-appointed legal guardian -- that is, if they're unable to make informed decisions, if they cannot give informed consent, because they are: 

That "other path" is the Middle Way which he tells to his five (former) companions when he meets them again after his enlightenment. So the details are not important, just the fact that one tortures oneself? They were presumably actual practices, which the sutta is listing as explicitly austere (unnecessary). See also Dhutanga practices which are optional (regarding which this commentary says these are not extreme, and may optionally be adopted to further simplify a monk's life). I'm not sure what the motive is or was for asceticism; I could guess (e.g. ascetism is also associated with devotees of Shiva), but with the Buddha stating that asceticism is fruitless (or, more specifically, is painful in the present and leads to hell in the future) I don't see much point in pursuing that topic. 

Sati is defined in the Sati Sutta (SN 47.35). Relevant words from that definition seem to me to be viharati and ...passī: 

Right view means understanding the four noble truths. Right intention follows as a consequence of right view. There are three intentions (renunciation, non-aversion or loving-kindness, and non-injury or compassion). 

I think a basic premise or setup is that, via bad karma people are reborn in a lower state (e.g. as an animal, as a hungry ghost, or in hell); and via good karma (which you didn't mention) they may be reborn in a higher state (e.g. as a semi-divinity or in some kind of heaven). Whereas nirvana is neither of the above, e.g. it's "deathless", "immediate", "experienced in the here and how", and not associated with rebirth (quite the opposite: being liberated from samsara). Also I'm not sure about your premise that Person A's karma is removed by Person B's deed, and transferred to person B. I think that we (e.g. if we are "Person A") are supposed to think of ourselves as being responsbible for our own karma. 

I'm sorry if this answer is ignorant but I think you're asking whether form has an existence independent of one's experience of it. Like asking, "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" My guess is that non-self (by which, I don't mean "they're not me", I mean "they are not themselves") implies that a form doesn't have any independent existence as that form. In summary: 

That reminds me of (among other things) this scene in a movie, As Good as It Gets, where the girl is wooed by an antihero and cries out, "Why can't I just have a normal boy-friend? Why? Just a regular boy-friend who doesn't go nuts on me?" At that point her mum, who's listening behind the door, pops out and says, "Everybody wants that, dear. It doesn't exist. Oh I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt." If you want to meet people who've already solved their personal problems then I guess you need a different job (or to meet other people outside the scope of your job). If you're saying "If only other people had the same views as I have then they wouldn't have a problem", I think you're not the first person to have said that. :-) 

Google returns many results (with explanations, for example this one or this one), if you search for buddha nine characteristics (or 'qualities' or 'virtues'), rather than nine 'values'. Or Wikipedia mentions 10 characteristics.
