Answer: Yes, all of them. As you know, philosophy means "love" of wisdom or knowledge. An object of "love" is never a means, always an end. The concept of 'value" simply does not arise, except in a relativistic sense. It cannot be "intrinsic" in any metaphysical sense of that term. That is just historically, textually behind us. For me, the best critical, materialist theory of "value" is Marxist. And the best contemporary Marxist theory is summarized by Koji Karatani and perhaps Jean-Joseph Goux. Value arises only in relation to... or relative to some, ideal, the "general equivalent," such as "money" or the "absolute monarch." This ideal grounds the "value system." And enables "evaluations." The value system that evaluates "knowledge" is philosophy, which grounds itself in the "love" of knowledge. The problem afflicting philosophy in the context of "modernity", and especially analytical philosophy, is that it fails to recognize itself as a form of love. In the modern context "knowledge" cannot be defined except in relation to some object of knowledge. And thus the "value" of knowledge is relative to that object...or objective. One must then rank all these "objectives," how? Presumably in such a way that "knowledge of them" is reproduced. Which leads us back to love... 

The purpose of your life is called, nontechnically, the "future." What I mean by this is that the telos or "end-in-itself" of a life is not to be discovered within that life. It is external, not yet arrived at, not to be found empirically in advance of experience or analytically within the subject. The acorn, to use the Aristotelean cliche, cannot infer or discover that it will become an oak. That is forever outside of its existence, except perhaps partially by reflection upon other oaks. So it is no wonder that you can't find the purpose of your life by "looking around" or "thinking it through." That's good. To fully answer the question would imply that the "future" is over. So the purpose of life is a "higher purpose" than what presently exists. We have a strong intuition that it entails other lives and their "future" as well. We can't ever know. For all you know, the purpose of your life may have nothing to do with "yourself" and everything to do with someone about to the born on the other side of the world. Would you really want it to be any less unanswerable and mysterious? You may secretly be asking: "To whom must I justify my life?" But that would require posting another question. 

There are, I believe, a number of cases of distinct scientific theories that are equally good at explaining phenomena...until experimental evidence favors one over the other. Proponents of the steady state universe versus the expanding universe were about equally divided, with the discovery of background radiation tipping the balance. The Ptolemaic system and the Copernican system existed alongside one another for a time, both equally coherent and consistent with phenomena. I believe the "holographic model" of the universe recalculates general relativity with a dimension subtracted, but I may have that bolloxed up. In both cosmology and quantum theory three are a number of mathematically developed, competing theories awaiting some experimental framework. And in many cases, Occam's razor may become the sole distinction between equally plausible theories. The problem lies in "describe nature correctly." Correlation with phenomena is often complex and usually based on forthcoming predictive capacity. I think that if two distinct theories both correlate to the same phenomena they would logically be "reducible to on a another." 

First, I would say that many supporters of science are too proselytizing, too reluctant to admit the ambiguities and necessary limits of science. This merely harms their own case by opening them up the same skeptical attacks so easily employed against religion. Second, I would observe that science and religion are by no means mutually exclusive. It is only where they offer mutually exclusive interpretations of the same phenomena that they become antagonistic. Such contradictory interpretations often mix metaphors, terminologies, causal agency, and levels of abstraction in ways that are quite superficial. Third, one can explain the "enabling constraints" of science. Many people, even many scientists, do talk as if science revealed "absolute truths." It reveals conditional truths under the well-understood rules of induction and probability. Strictly speaking, science is a principled agnosticism. One can happily concede that science cannot "disprove" intelligent design. It is simply not compatible with the best evidence or other scientific findings. And it violates parsimony. But is it "true?" That is not a scientific question. Having conceded this much, one can then describe science as a "practice" for arriving at a working consensus based on transparent, public rules of evidence. Here we introduce the usual list: falsifiability, confirmation of predictions, repeatability of experiments, mathematical description under some Hamiltonian, peer review.... and, too often neglected, the continuous confirmation of technologies. If one accepts a pragmatic view that these are methods of arriving not at indubitable "truth" but at justified, reliable beliefs and agreements, the contrast with religion is historically much more clear. It is also well to admit that science has grey areas, lacunae, and boundary issues. But building some God-of-the-Gaps out of these is a pretty paltry sort of religion anyway. Specifically, the problems introduced by recent science, cosmology in particular, really do push physics towards metaphysics, and it is just as well to admit that. This is assumed to be a temporary situation. Here science can only say that "the math works." The untested theories are those that appear most consistent with the theories enjoying experimental confirmation. If string theory or quantum gravity abandon the possibility of prediction and experimental confirmation, they hang in a metaphysical void, no longer science. If the devout can discover a series of prayers that reliably resurrects the dead and is repeatable, their deity is well on the way to scientific hypothesis. I tend to think the strength of science involves its "enabling constraints," the limits that scientists are often reluctant to admit. This offends those who see only an unwarranted explanatory hegemony instead of an ennobling explanatory constraint. 

I'm a bit lost in some of your argument, but will unwarily speak my piece. First, as Conifold has indicated, you see to be anticipating some of Kant's arguments by alluding to "necessary inferences." But I don't think it is quite accurate to say that Hume has a "problem with induction." Induction works and is, by definition, "mostly" correct. Hume was only pointing out that certain "necessary truths" were far more inductive than people had suspected. The warrant of Newton mechanics was by no means absolute, as proved to be the case. It's just that the "laws" of science, however reliable, do not get us beyond induction. It has been pointed out that Hume seems inconsistent in arguing against necessary "causality" in observed phenomena, while apparently accepting some Lockean object "I-know-not-what" that "causes" our experience of that object. I believe this is what you are saying, partly. But here again, Hume is only pointing to apparent regularities. He cannot be arguing that the "I-know-not-what" necessarily "causes" our experiences in some incorrigible correlation. How would we know? As with induction in natural sciences, such a necessary "correlation" behind our experiences cannot be observed or proved. Hume does not think all of this is a big problem. It is the overextension of knowledge on the basis of unwarranted certainties that are a problem, as the financial industry would do well the remember. I hasten to add that I am not a scholar of Hume or anything else, and I may have misunderstood your question. I hope others will intervene if so. In sum, there is no big problem of induction, as long as you know that is what you are doing. Science has come to agree with Hume (or with Kant--they are in some ways more similar than not), that "causality" is our mathematical determination of probabilities to be formulated according to experience on a case-by-case basis. Not a universal glue. Only a "necessary" prop or condition of being what we are. 

I would say from personal experience that reading Hegel in translation is worthwhile. I would go so far as to say that all worthwhile philosophy must be translatable across languages almost by definition. Of course, a lot will be missed. Hegel apparently delights in words with double meanings, for example. Yet I too have heard from German speakers that some of Hegel may actually be clearer in English, once forced through the interpretive "strainer" of translation. Some people claim that it helps to read his early theological writings to get a better sense of him. On the other hand, much of his writing, "The Philosophy of History," for example, is not obscure at all. In more difficult works like "The Science of Logic," you just have go very, very slooooowly. I'd recommend just reading the section on "The Doctrine of Being" line by line about 10 times over, chewing and cogitating. It's actually very interesting. It contains much "Hegelianism" in a few pages. And the slow-drip method is much more rewarding than attempting to "read the book" at a first go. 

I don't think your Gettier-like argument for religion holds up, though it has often been attempted. There are many utilitarian or functionalist arguments for the practical validity of certain religious beliefs, such Voltaire's argument that it would be necessary to invent God had he not existed. Which he did not mean in jest. Generally, such arguments can only be made from an agnostic viewpoint, and they are sometimes referred to as "double truth" stances. In addition to Voltaire, many enlightenment figures did not themselves believe in religion, but thought it was better if most people continued to. But you seem to be conflating a functionalist account of "truth" and a religious account of "beliefs." It is not the "beliefs" that are validated, but the moral "behaviors" in a social-historical context, which may or may not be correlated to some religious beliefs... and which may or may not have the universal efficacy you assign them. Moreover, you are making a fallacious appeal to Darwinism. Nothing in that theory assumes that the existence of some phenomenon necessarily proves its value...or, worse, the "truth" of its necessity. That is a "Just So Story." Such beliefs could easily be epiphenomenal "spandrels". Indeed human evolution through so many different beliefs systems suggests as much. Gods appear to have a very high extinction rate. We may certainly observe that myths and theological myths in particular may be an effective medium for storing and transmitting useful social rules. As are poems and legal codes. But that does not seem to warrant "true-unjustified belief" in any formal sense, which would require justifying causal properties of beliefs themselves and seems headed towards some sort of circularity. 

The two "golden rules" are very similar, but Kant's is strictly deontic and nonconsequentialist. It may even be arguable that its deontic, theological perspective could mandate actions that are not necessarily "good" for a given society or even for "humanity" per se. It is notoriously ill-suited to a complex division of labor in civil society and hence criticized as an empty formalism by Hegel and others. Rawls is not a consequentialist and is explicitly an opponent of utilitarianism. Nonetheless, his rules do seem more practical than idealist, with hints of a redescription of "state of nature" arguments. Nor are his rules commands to the "will" or eternal souls of individuals, even if no one is watching, so to speak. To address the question more closely, Rawls derives the "difference principle" from the first two, I believe, and I am wondering if this principle is compatible with Kant's CI? Not obviously. And again, Rawls is generally addressing diverse behaviors where Kant addresses the "will." The approaches all seem to be in the same spirit, along with Habbermas's "ideal speech situation," and are admirable alternatives to the flaws of utilitarianism. But "derivable"? I can't see them nested in that way. It seems to me hard to get anything from formal CI alone that is applicable to human practices here on planet earth. 

Answer: It depends, or doesn't. First, since your question concerns knowledge and "how things are known" it belongs to epistemology. It does appear to be a fair example of "transcendental" philosophy, as originally developed by Kant. Such philosophy addresses not only analytical or "rational" truths and "empirical" knowledge from experience, but knowledge about "possible experience." It concerns knowledge outside of experience (hence "transcendental"), yet inferred from the a priori structure of concepts that makes experience itself possible. However, Kant's transcendental philosophy would not admit knowledge that in principle "can't be known." Like Locke, he does admit that, yes, there always remains "something" that we do not and can never know. Kant called this "noumena" or "things-in-themselves" existing independently of anything we could ever know about them. Locke called this simply the "I-know-not-what" behind our perceptions. By definition they are not "known," for we can say nothing about them. Critics of Kant argued that this was incoherent. How could Kant then "know" they exist and "say" or "affirm" that they exist? So your question appears to be in this camp. However, this is far trickier than it seems. (Alas, nothing about transcendental philosophy is simple.) Your question could also be simply analytical. This is more difficult to unpack. Your question could be answered by an analysis of the terms with no recourse to "possible experiences." It isn't always easy to tell and can take some work. So, it depends on how you develop your answer. You could pursue a "transcendental deduction" dependent in principle on possible experience, Kant's "synthetic a priori." Or you could pursue an answer by logical analysis of the terms. Your use of the word "define" does suggest the latter. Good hunting! 

I agree with commenters that question as it stands is unlikely to elicit good answers. Given the lack of context and the wildly spluttering, multi-limbed brain of Zizek, who knows? I will offer one modest, reasonable reply. To many Marxist theorists, such as Luxemburg and Karatami, Capital accumulation always requires a noncapitalist environment, relatively unexploited resources and populations external to the system. I believe this is correct. The most obvious examples are 19th-century imperialism and the modern "liberation" movements that drew minorities, women, "youth vanguards," etc., into labor and consumption systems. This noncapitalist environment, or The Frontier, can be anything, from a rainforest to public institutions, from the family home to a war zone. And it can be continually recreated, by sheer destruction of Capital if need be. So from the perspective of Capital, eventual penetration of the billion-plus labor force and consumption capacities of the supposedly communist countries was essential, perhaps inevitable. Why was it reciprocal? First, no Marxist would describe the Soviet Union or China as communist. With the collapse of the Second International and the failure global revolution, Russia and later China were still-born as deformed, state-capitalist systems regressing into international competition with the liberal capitalist nation states. Since the states failed dramatically to "wither away" they remained precariously "on top" with all the modern state problems of stabilizing and appeasing mass populations increasingly alienated from "the revolution." They could not help but observe that "consumerism" proved to be an unsurpassable tool of regulation, political diversion, and popular quiescence. What else were they to do? Marxism proper is, like Christianity, a "universalist" ideology and "utopian" aspiration. When the social structure remains locked into "state" structures policies are determined of necessity by the other, antagonistic states, not by some aspirational ideology. As "states" organizing "capital," the "different objectives" you cite are entirely superficial. For the real answer, you'll have to ask Zizek, in whom a thousand answers bloom.
