Probably. If you bought one with a bigger fan or other dump zone, no. But that would mean the old school "bike wheel with fan blades riveted on" that people hate so much. One alternative that would work is the "pedal powered generator" setup that the green kids are so fond of building, because they usually have bigger flywheels that consequently rotate more slowly (and as I keep saying, the problems go up with the square of the speed, so twice the roller diameter means 1/4 the force). But they're big, heavy and expensive compared to a trainer, and you have to build your own if you want that power output (commercial ones seem to top out at about 200W - I keep looking because I'd like one rated to 500W). 

My expectation with this design is that you'll be able to carry 15-25kg over a fairly rough track, if you built it reasonably well. Use the heaviest bike you can find as the donor, you want nice thick tubes. But it will probably fail by bending close to one of the joints. Bike tubing is not really designed to deal with bending. With the design sketched I think that'll work fine with 26" wheels. The main thing will be welding the steering on the trailer frame/donor bike so it doesn't wiggle. Because the fork/wheel is going backwards the rake on the steering will be backwards, so if it's loose it'll be like trying to roll a castor backwards - very wiggly and unstable. Turning the fork round will help, but I suspect not much. The suspension will probably not work as well as you hope because a fair bit of the force will be across the line of the suspension movement - rather than "brake dive" you'll have... nothing. I'd be tempted to try to get the fork more vertical, but that could end up making the design more complex and you're better off making something quickly, riding with it, then fixing the things that annoy you most once you have something that works. Chainstays, your "bottom part", are really not designed to take bending loads, so that will be your weak point (assuming your welds hold). I would be tempted to brace those somehow, even just putting another tube between them with welded joints at the ends to reinforce that area will make the trailer stronger. If you have a space bit of tubing that would be well worth while. Gussets, BTW, will not help (here, or almost anywhere), they just shift the point of failure to the end of the gusset - designing an effective gusset is hard. That ExtraWheel trailer design is all about a triangulated frame, and you could probably fake it using the seatstays and chainstays off two bikes, welded to a headset. It would probably be easier to build, but the attachment to your bike would probably be more tricky. I'd be tempted to bolt into the rack eyelets, if you have them, and see what happens. 

With "be seen" lights good ones have a very wide beam pattern so they can be seen from all angles, which makes precise orientation less relevant. If you look at Nathan's bike light database most of those lights are about 180° horizontal beam spread and 90° or more vertically. Again, the better ones have a more even beam spread so there's really no "hot axis" that gets more light. So I mount them for convenience. I look for somewhere I can attach them where they won't get bumped and point more or less along the axis of the bike, and more or less horizontally. Clipping them into the back pocket of my jeans rather than my belt, for example :) If you have a poorly made "be seen" light that has a real beam and poor spread, the only real solution is to buy a better one. If you're using an old "see by" LED light in flash mode for this, I suggest setting it up as a "see by" light (per answers to your other question), and using it that way. If it's particularly bright, the polite thing to do is turn it off or use a lower brightness setting when you're on the bike path. On roads the oncoming traffic should be some way out of your path so blinding shouldn't be an issue. If it is (really narrow roads, for example), I point mine down when I see oncoming traffic. Or turn them off. I have dyno lights that are always on, so turning the blinkie off doesn't break the law or make me invisible. With my "see sense" lights that are designed to mount to a vertical tube and are annoyingly bright, I mount the front one to my head tube right under the stem so that I am shaded by the stem. That also helps a little with the upward part of the beam, but the real solution is to turn them down at night. It seems a bit odd, but a "daylight visible" flashing light is scary bright at night. So I run them on the lowest power setting at night (maybe ~30 lumens rather than the ~200 lumen peak). I can still see it lighting up reflective signs at 100m, so it's visible enough. 

It seems to be fairly straightforward, I found a number of links around the web to people who have done it. Any crankset can take a single chainring, just make sure you mount it on the correct side of the spider when you do the swap. Try to match the existing chainline. You may need to change the bottom bracket to maintain chainline and crank-frame clearance, but none of those links mentioned it as a problem. FWIW I'm 180cm tall and run 150mm cranks on my commuter because they were the shorted I could get without paying silly money. They were the same price as cheap standard cranks. Unfortunately they're also made of low-quality aluminium and have bent somewhat in use. If you're strong or heavy I suspect the same may happen to you, but a Brompton is sufficiently flimsy that it may not be an issue (you might not be able to apply enough force without breaking the bike). IMO the best solution is to wait until it happens and buy more expensive cranks then, rather than paying up front when you might not need to. 

If you have a work space that you can hang stuff in, the various "hang my bike" rope systems are quite usable, or you can build your own with some pulleys and rope. I do that for my larger bikes (I have a long john and a quad bike), but they're somewhat annoying as the bike isn't held rigidly - it sways when you push on it. It's as bad as using the cheap, light workstands with skinny poles that bend when you push on them. 

For hill climbing without the ability to change the gear the motor is in you're going to have to pick a lower gear than it was designed with, somehow, and accept that it won't help much on the flat. The "chain driven" kit you're looking at will only work while you're pedalling, as it requires you to keep the chain tight against the motor sprocket. Despite the bike being shown with gears, the motor will only work in one gear, otherwise the chain won't hit the sprocket on the motor. If you're lucky you will be able to choose the gear, and you can choose a fairly low one to go up hills in. If you're even more lucky the other gears will still be usable without the motor.I suggest you ask the seller those questions before buying. They say: 

If you're lucky the mount will look like this one and you'll be able to put the screw vertically up underneath through non-critical plastic. That way if you do crack it it doesn't matter too much. 

Lugged Frame also lugs A method of frame-building where at least the major joints consist of frame tubes inserted into castings (the lugs). Occasionally lugs are hand-made by bending and filing rather than casting. Lugged frames are normally brazed, but can also be soldered (with lead or silver rather than brass) and occasionally glued (the Windcheetah trike used glued aluminium, for example). Historically this was very common, and many classic steel frames were built this way. Today with better welding technology it's rare, especially in mass produced bikes. 

The more a "work stand" looks like the transport rack on the back of a car, the less usable it will be. The are easy to make, and that's what I've made in the past. My welding stand is as basic as you get - it's a couple of 10cm lengths of angle iron, one welded to the fixed stand and the other welded to a cheap pair of vice grips, that are welded to the stand. It works, but it's brutal and it's not adjustable enough. Many of the cheap "work stands" differ from that only by having padded jaws. 

When I replaced that cog I did not replace the chainring, just the chain. The problem with leaving it until too many teeth have broken off is that it can be hard to get a chain whip on to remove the cog.
