In chapter 2 of "The Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres" where Copernicus maintains that the Earth is spherical, the Edward Rosen translation of the book states this. 

Copernicus then in the paragraph above, argues that the Earth too must orbit around the center in order to account for the "slowness" in the poles. However Copernicus further refutes this by stating that there would be no day/night cycle in this case. To elaborate on my question asked in the title. Why would the Earth need to orbit in order to account for this "slowness." And why would there be no day/night cycle even though the firmament would be rotating and not the Earth along with it. 

I'd like to know how according to Copernicus, Solar and Lunar eclipses during the "evening" can't be seen by "easterners," and vice versa for "westerners." 

In chapter 6 of "The Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres" where Copernicus maintains that the heavens are immense compared to the size of the Earth, the Edward Rosen translation of the book states this 

For context, when Ptolemy is speaking about “the first of these three positions…” he’s speaking about the position that holds that the Earth is equidistant from both poles of the celestial sphere, but is not on the axis spanning between both poles. He states that he’s arguing against the first proposition, and suggests that if an observer were at sphaera recta (which I’ve taken to mean that the observer is at the equator with direction/horizon being perpendicular to the equator,) then he would never experience equinox because his “horizon would always divide the heavens into two unequal parts, one above and one below the earth…” I assume that in this case, while the Earth is displaced from the center of the celestial sphere, the Sun is still orbiting the true center. However, if it was equinox, and the Sun was orbiting on the same plane as the true center. Wouldn’t this observer still experience equinox because the Earth is still on the same plane as the true center? Here’s the link to my source (page 41, chapter 6:) $URL$ 

The orbit of the moon is stable on a timescale of billions of years. Low Earth Orbit is not stable in the long term. However, Geostationary orbits are very long lived. The satellites in geostationary orbit will eventually be perturbed (some to collide with the Earth, some probably to escape) But this will take much longer than human lifespans. For practical purposes the geostationary orbits are stable. Geostationary satellites use thrusters for station keeping, not to prevent their orbits from decaying. Beyond the Earth, it is believed that the planet's orbits are stable. There is a very small chance that a resonance between Mercury and Jupiter could develop, and that could cause Mercury's orbit to change substantially (or even collide with another planet), over the course of about 3 billion years. More generally the solar system is known to be technically chaotic. While the orbits of the planets won't change, it is not possible to predict the position of the planets after about 50-100 million years. The stability of the solar system and Geostationary orbit is in contrast to truly unstable orbital configurations. LEO is unstable due to atmospheric drag. Many 3-body configurations are unstable, and result in the ejection of one member of the system. A three body system may be periodic but unstable, in the sense that a perturbation of the system results in chaos, and the ejection of one of the members of the system. 

Here is how the tides move the moon away from the Earth: The moon orbits the earth, and there is a difference in gravitational force between the the side of the Earth nearest the moon, and the side far from the moon. This difference in force tends to pull the Earth into a oval shape with its long axis pointing towards the moon. But the Earth is also spinning, and this spinning moves the axis of the oval forward, so the oval doesn't point towards the moon, but a little ahead of it. So there is a bump on the Earth, and it is permanently a little in front of the moon. This bump has mass and it pulls the moon towards it, So the moon is being pulled forwards. The moon pulls the Earth back. So the Earth's spin is slowed, but the moon gains energy and moves a little further from the Earth. The moon has also been slowed down to the extent that the same side always faces Earth, and it will remain locked like this. Gravitational waves, on the other hand, imply an emmision of energy from the binary system, and as energy is lost, the black holes spiral in. There are no tides on black holes because there is nothing there to be pulled into an oval shape. The event horizon is not a solid surface. The mass of a black hole is concentrated entirely at the singularity, there is no structure to be deformed into a bump. 

@JeppeStigNielsen makes a good point about differences in tidal locking in the comments below. In the Earth-Moon system, only Moon is tidally locked (which causes us to see only one face of it, so only roughly a half of it, from Earth), whereas in Pluto-Charon both of the bodies are tidally locked. Earth is not tidally locked because of the higher mass ratio between it and Moon, but the lower mass ratio Pluto-Charon system is, as the lower mass Charon has slowly changed Pluto's rotation to match its orbital movement. 

It does indeed seem counterintuitive that $L_4$ and $L_5$ would be at the same time both high points of potential as well as stable points in the system. In fact, a quick look at an example contour plot with all five Lagrangian points demonstrated would also suggest that $L_4$ and $L_5$ would be unstable: 

They do, but due to the ratio of masses being vastly different, they seem like they would not to do so as moon seems to rotate just around (the centre of) Earth. The ratio of Earth and Moon's masses is $\frac{M_{Earth}}{M_{Moon}} = 81.3$ whereas for Pluto and Charon the same ratio is $\frac{M_{Pluto}}{M_{Charon}} = 8.09$. Because the ratio for Pluto and Charon is relatively small, the center of the system – barycenter, around which the two bodies orbit – is somewhere on a line drawn between the two celestial bodies's mass centers. But for Earth and Moon, because Earth is proportionally much heavier, the system's barycenter does not reach outside of Earth, but instead is about 4,500 kilometers from the center of Earth (see the photo below, too): 

The major effect of this co-rotational system is that Earth seems to "wobble" on its orbit, as mentioned in the quote from Wikipedia above. 

In the picture you can see that $L_1 - L_3$ are placed in saddle nodes, and intuitively one concludes that the smallest perturbation would set them "falling" in either direction, i.e. they need station keeping. However, $L_4$ and $L_5$ would still seem to be unstable, so what gives? What makes $L_4$ and $L_5$ stable is that each of them is located equidistant from both of the masses. This leads to the gravitational forces from each of the bodies towards $L_4$ and $L_5$ to be in the same ratio as the two bodies' masses, hence the resultant acceleration points towards the barycentre of the system (which is also the centre of rotation for a three-body system). This resultant acceleration, and by extension force, leads to the object in either $L_4$ or $L_5$ to in fact have just the correct amount of acceleration / correct force towards the system's barycentre so that it will not fall out of orbit (it "falls" towards the barycentre as the system rotates, like Earth similarly falls towards Sun throughout its orbit), as counterintuitive as it sounds at first. (Furthermore, this effect is not only limited to bodies of negligible mass, but is independent of mass, which is why you can have more massive bodies orbiting in $L_4$ and $L_5$ like Jupiter's trojans, as well as smaller, artificial satellites.)

I think you may be mixing up "Energy" and "Power" a little here. Power is the rate of Energy output per time. If Power is the speed, then Energy is the distance travelled. Quasars look like stars, from Earth, they give out a light, and while they do vary a little (or a lot) you would not expect to see new ones forming or existing ones fading away. Gamma Ray Bursts are a short lived. While a quasar will emit more energy over it's long life. Gamma Ray Bursts are more powerful. They are formed mostly as a result of energy released in gravitational collapse during a hypernova. Moreover this energy is released in a narrow beam. Imagine comparing a laser beam with a equivalent power light bulb. If the laser is pointing right at you, it appears much brighter than the bulb. So the answers: 

It really doesn't make much sense to talk about magnification unless you are actually looking into an eyepiece. When you have a "backyard" telescope, for direct observation (not photographic) the magnification is a sensible thing. The light recording surface is fixed (your eye). The primary focus of the telescope is a small image of the sky, so an eyepiece is used to magnify the primary focus. The overall magnification of the sky depends focal length of the main mirror, and the focal length of the eyepiece. $M=F_O/F_e$ For a small telescope, the maximum useful magnification is limited by the size of the main mirror. A larger mirror would allow for greater resolution, and so a more powerful eyepiece can be used. But the Keck is a different beast. The limit on resolution is determined not by the size of the mirror, but by the blurring due to the atmosphere. It doesn't matter how big the mirror is, there is no more information that can be gained by greater magnification. Nobody is sticking an eyepiece at the primary focus and looking down it. Instead the light at the primary focus is passes into various scientific instruments. Most of the are spectrometers of one sort of another, and so they don't produce magnified images. If you have an image, the concept of magnification is unclear. If I have a photo of Jupiter, and I move my head closer to the image, it gets bigger. So what is the magnification? It depends on the distance of the observer to the image. It really doesn't make much sense to talk about magnification unless you are actually looking into an eyepiece. There are some cameras that are used, such as the NIRC2. It has a narrow view mode with 0.009942 arcsec/pixel. On a typical 100 pixels per inch display, Jupiter (at 50 arcseconds) would be 50 inches across.
