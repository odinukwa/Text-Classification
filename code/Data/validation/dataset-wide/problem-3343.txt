In the stylised diagram above, the blade of your tongue is represented by the small pink rectangular section. The square behind that represents the ball of your tongue. Now when we talk about "front" vowels and the "front" of your tongue raising, we are talking about the front of this back part of your tongue. So when you think of your tongue in normal everyday terms, this is actually about half way down your tongue as you look at it in the mirror. This is what raises towards the roof of your mouth when you make an [i] vowel. The blade of your tongue does nothing at all. So the horizontal axis of the vowel quadrilateral shows whether it is the front of that bulky part of the tongue or the back of it that "is raising up". The vertical axis represents the distance between the tongue and the roof of the mouth. 

It is perfectly possible to have three morphemes in one syllable. Consider the word sixths which is comprised of the morphemes /sɪks/, /θ/, and /s/. So we can easily prove that many syllables exist that contain more than one morpheme. 

Here the two sentences do not convey the same information at all. We are not likely to infer the information in the second sentence when we read the first. One more factor comes into play here. Verbs that generate subordinate negation implicatures, tend to be what are described in the CaGEL as medium strength verbs. They contrast for example 'stronger' know with 'medium strength' believe. The reason that these verbs tend to generate such implicatures is merely that, pragmatically, it does not seem very informative to tell somebody that you don't have a medium strength stance about something. We tacitly infer, on this basis, the more informative proposition that the speaker has a stance about a negative idea. However, with so-called stronger verbs, on the other hand, it is informative to convey that your confidence in a stance is not 100%, or contrastingly with weak verbs to convey that that not even the slightest positive attitude is given to the proposition in the complement clause. The strong and weak usages of the following verbs do not, therefore, generate subordinate negation implication: 

So as can be seen from the examples above, a type of phrase, in this case a noun phrase, can have many different types of function. It's also important to realise that the same syntactic function can be realised by many different types of phrase. So, for instance, Predicative Complements can be noun phrases, adjective phrases or preposition phrases: 

English, conditional protases [ read "antecedents" ] bear a close resemblance to interrogative clauses. For example, they are often identical to subordinate closed interrogative clauses: 

This suggests that the word there is not part of this Locative Adjunct. If we look at the sentence above, it is easy to see that the main reason it is ungrammatical is because it does not have a Subject. This is because in the original example, the word there IS the Subject of the sentence as the data below indicates: 

As to why speakers actually prefer to negate verbs such as want and believe rather than to negate their complement clauses, I do not believe that anybody knows (- by which I want you to infer that I believe that nobody knows). 

In the examples above we see a noun phrase, an adjective phrase and a preposition phrase functioning as Predicative Complement of the verb BE. Adjuncts in clause structure So the important question here is: what's an Adjunct? In terms of clause structure, an Adjunct is an extra phrase in the clause. It is not a Subject or a Complement of the verb. A Complement of a verb is a phrase which fills a special slot set up by the verb. For example, the verb PUT has two special slots for certain types of phrase. Apart from a Subject slot, it has a slot for the thing that is being moved and it has a slot for the destination of that thing. If one of these slots isn't filled the sentence will be ungrammatical or seem a bit odd: 

Here the noun phrase it is a dummy subject, merely filling that syntactic position that would be occupied in canonical sentence by the clause that she didn't call back: 

There are many other types of function that preposition phrases can have. You need to be very careful therefore when you read passages which use the term adverbial. If the writers are thoughtful, careful and principled writers they will use the term to describe a particular type of function, namely Adjunct in clause structure. On the other hand they may be talking about a type of phrase, namely a preposition phrase, as opposed to a noun phrase, for example. However, if you're very unlucky they will be mixing and matching the phrase type and the function without realising it. Nearly every writer who uses the term adverbial to mean a preposition phrase will be guilty of this crime. The worst problem here is that the people who do this do not understand what they are doing. They will quite happily screw up the line between functions and types of phrase within the same paragraph or even within the same sentence without the slightest idea what they're doing. Perhaps even more gravely than this, the use of the term adverbial is so unevenly used and so confused in terms of whether it is a function or a phrase category, that many writers even substitute the word adverb for the term adverbial. This means that you will see many intelligent people saying ridiculous things such as: 

Unfortunately, the idea that we can define nouns or noun phrases through meaning won't stand close scrutiny. Very often a noun phrase will have no referent at all. For example, in the phrase: 

That second sentence is only meant to apply if you have been in an accident. Questions and conditionals are related in many interesting ways. 

Are there any non-European or non-Indo-European languages that use conditional protases that correspond to any or all of the three types of interrogative clauses listed above? I'm extremely interested in all three, but extra-specially interested in protases corresponding to closed interrogatives. 

Words with negative meanings in English are always stressed. If you think about this it isn't surprising as English tends to stress those words that are essential to understanding the gist of a sentence (those items that are sometimes loosely termed "content" words). The word not is essential for a proper understanding of the sentence, if you don't hear it you'll understand more or less the opposite of the intended meaning of the sentence. As a rule of thumb adding a negative word to an English sentence does not affect whether the other words in the sentence are stressed (ignoring words that become contracted with not and other oddities like that). It may however affect the relative prominence of other words in the sentence. In other words it may appear more, or sometimes less prominent than another stressed syllable in the sentence. This just depends on the speaker's delivery of the sentence and any intended nuances. 

In the sentence above we can see that there is a 'gap' in the clause I like where we would normally expect a Direct Object to be. We can model the sentence like this: 

Always and never are adverbs of frequency. The phrase all the time is a noun phrase. We use all three if these items as (temporal) adjuncts, a term which refers to their syntactic function, in other words what job they are doing in the sentence rather than what word or phrase category they are. In terms of semantics and their being 'non-expiry' terms, I think one term that is sometimes used to denote this is that they represent unbounded periods of time. 

If you use the cursor to manually click on the letters on the on-screen keyboard, it takes ages and is mentally exhausting as well as morally tedious. However, if you look at the page that the link takes you to, you will see that the on-screen keyboard is broken into sections. On the left of each section there is a symbol in orange that relates very simply and intuitively to a symbol on your physical keyboard. In order to get any of the IPA symbols from that section, instead of moving the cursor to the correct symbol on the screen, just use your manual keyboard. Press ALT and then keep tapping the key shown in the orange circle until the desired IPA symbol pops up. Once you get used to this, it really is quite fast and I find it much easier than any of the other methods that I know of. 

Full answer The term adverbial is a bane to the principled study of language. It is the epitome of the worst problem in the field of language study - a problem which should by now be regarded as a schoolkid problem - the problem of not understanding the difference between syntactic functions (or grammatical relations) and parts of speech or types of phrase. For a few principled writers who use the term, an adverbial is a phrase which functions as an Adjunct (read Modifier) in a clause. The important point there is that adverbial in any principled description of language is a type of syntactic function (or grammatical relation). It is not a type of phrase or a type of word. Syntactic functions (also described as grammatical relations) are the different jobs that chunks of words can do in a sentence or phrase. So for example the chunk of words the elephant you met yesterday, which happens to be a noun phrase, has the function of Subject in : 

This sentence on the other hand does use an LDD construction. However, there is no gap here between the word lunch and the verb went. The word lunch is just the last word in the noun phrase the man that I saw yesterday after lunch. This noun phrase is occurring in the normal subject position in relation to the verb went. So there is no missing element between the two. However, within this subject noun phrase there is a relative clause that I saw yesterday after lunch. This clause has a gap where we would expect the direct object to be. The gap is co-indexed with the antecedent the man: 

Now here we see that the clause I punched __ is embedded within a larger clause Bob said [ I punched __ ]. So here the gap depends on a word not just to the left of the immediate clause it occurs in, but on a word to the left of a different larger clause that that smaller clause is embedded in. So the dependency relationship here is spanning two clauses. It is this property of the antecedent gap relationship existing across clause boundaries which leads us to call them long distance dependencies. Some linguists call constructions such as the ones above unbounded dependency constructions, because in theory there is no limit to the number of embedded clauses involved: 

Here is a pertinent passage by Geoffrey K. Pullum about the function-form confusion. The quote is taken from LEXICAL CATEGORIZATION IN ENGLISH DICTIONARIES AND TRADITIONAL GRAMMARS 2009: 

This, however, is as far as it goes. We do not allow for punctuation marks or capitalisation and so forth in phonemic or phonetic transcriptions. Phones and phonemes do not have capital or small case realisations! Several other problems would arise if we did. First of all many symbols used in punctuation have a distinct specific meaning when used in IPA transcription. To illustrate, the exclamation mark, < ! >, represents an alveolar click; an apostrophe < ’ > after a consonant makes it ejective. Most importantly here, the IPA system actually uses small caps capitals to represent specific types of phone. So [ʙ,ɢ, ʜ, ɪ, ʟ, ɴ] and [ʀ] are completely different and distinct sounds from [b, g, h, i, l, n] and [r]. If you use a < B > to represent a [b], you will actually be indicating a voiced bilabial trill—in other words a bilabial raspberry—instead of a plosive. IPA transcriptions match sounds not their written counterparts! 

The Original Poster is going to have a massive problem here, brackets or no brackets. When we use slanty brackets, we use language-specific symbols to represent different phonemes. For example, the convention for transcribing the STRUT vowel in RP English is to use the upturned 'v': /ʌ/. This symbol does not relate in any meaningful way to the position of the notional sound on the vowel quadrilateral used on the international IPA chart. If the Poster feels that a particular word produced uses a different sound from the one we would expect from the dictionary transcription, then, if they use slanty brackets, they are going to have to choose a different English-specific IPA symbol to represent that sound. It is highly unlikely that the sound produced by the speaker will neatly fit into the same slot as a different English phoneme. So for example, if they are saying /bed/ but with a very open /e/, the poster might decide to use an /æ/ instead. But of course, this sound is very unlikely to actually be more like a typical /æ/ than an /e/. So using an /æ/ here is not really appropriate. Apart from anything else the speaker clearly will be using their own allophone of /e/, not /æ/. So that would seem to suggest that we need to use square brackets so that we can use an appropriate symbol from the international IPA set to describe the sound. But then the problem is that we can no longer use the remaining set of symbols chosen specifically for the transciption of English. The reason for this is that the strut vowel will no longer be able to be transcribed using /ʌ/, because the proper symbol for this when using the international set of symbols is going to be [ɐ], not [ʌ]. Similarly nearly all the other vowel symbols are going to have to change or have some diacritic added. This means that it will be very difficult to compare the output with what is given by the dictionary. Apart from this we can never be certain what target sound the dictionary transcription is intending anyway - because their transcription was from the set of English specific symbols relating to phonemes, not necessarily a clearly identified sound on the IPA vowel quadrilateral! Although this second method might be better, it will take a lot more time and thought on the part of the Original Poster, and will necessarily be flawed to some degree. 

What to do about this Ideally we can avoid actually using the term adverbial ever at all. But if we do have to use it, because our peers do for example, we need to be careful that we use it to refer to a function in clause structure. If we absolutely have to use it to refer to a type of phrase (specifically a preposition phrase) we need to make it crystal clear to our readers or listeners that we are using it in this way. Most importantly we need to make sure that when we use it, we ourselves know exactly what we are referring to and that we don't slip between functions and phrasal categories like a hormonally confused teenager. 

I think the Original Poster might be of the widely held belief that sign language translates 'actual' spoken language into signs. For example, one could envisage a system where the sentence she is at home would have four signs, one meaning she one meaning is, one meaning at and one meaning home. This would be a system similar to signed English for example, where the language being signed basically is English in a manually coded form. This could be likened for example to morse code. However, this is not what sign languages are. Sign languages have their own distinct syntax and morphology and are full languages in their own right. British sign language for example is perhaps best characterised as an OSV language, where as American Sign Language is often described as an SVO language. So the answer to the Original Poster's question is that spoken languages do not "have" sign languages. Rather people in different areas speak different sign languages that are distinct from each other as well as being distinct from the oral languages spoken in those areas (although, like other languages, sign languages borrow from other languages, including oral languages such as English).
