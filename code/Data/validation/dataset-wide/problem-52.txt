State-Sanctioned Divine Beings Short answer: No These divine beings aren't the church, the church is simply an organization that worships them. The beings themselves are separate entities, and as a result contracting them should have no legal implications in terms of separation of church and state. This only changes if the beings are a part of the leadership structure of the church itself. For example, if an Angel holds an official position of power in the church equivalent to a bishop or priest. Weaponized Priesthood Short answer: No, but only if they are being contracted like mercenary groups This part of the answer is a simple one. If they're being given specific contracts as if they were mercenaries, then this is no violation. This isn't a violation because they're never becoming a part of the state itself. If they are official government employees, however, then this is a violation. These are official parts of the church that are also official parts of the government, and this is a violation of church and state. However... As Daron's answer has indicated, there's no law that enforces a separation of church and state. This answer is more of a guide of things that are and aren't violating the concept of separation of Church and State, which while it might not be useful for the legal aspects of your world, might be useful for the societal impacts. 

So how can you build your cephalopod language? Celaphapods have tentacles that can move. They don't have hands that can form complex handshapes. That, then, is where the colour comes in. Colour may have a direct morphological meaning (red means anger, for example), but no doubt would also have more abstract meanings (perhaps red as an intensifier, or brighter hues as an intensifier), and direct meanings (red means red). Tentacles can move and gesture; colour can change during the course of a sign, or be held over the whole thing. Different tentacles can sign different concepts at the same time, and bring them together to show a relationship (as in my the bus went past me example from earlier). Colours on the body of the animal (either the whole body or in patches of colour, maybe even moving patches of colour), meanwhile, function in a manner roughly equivalent to movement of the face, head, and shoulders in sign languages, functioning mainly as discourse markers, intensifiers, and indicators of tone and emotion, though there is no reason why other grammatical features, such as tense, aspect, or evidentiality, could not also be indicated there. 

Would you count a Flettner roter using the Magnus effect as a “sail”? Veritasium has a video on the Magnus effect and its usage in boats and planes. These boats with spinning cylinders rather than (or as well as) traditional sails can get quite large. A Gizmodo article refers to them as mega-ships, and describes Flettner rotors being retrofitted to a 110,000 dwt (Suezmax) tanker. The efficiency gains are tricky to calculate, and these Flettner rotors are intended for supplemental use in addition to an existing engine, but with more predictable wind conditions the calculations involved would be simpler and this type of vessel could become common. 

So when I say everything, I mean everything. Humans, animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, all dead. If the bacteria and other detritovores and decomposers can't decompose anything since they themselves are all dead, what happens to all the carcasses and remains of the life? Do these remains decay through other inorganic means? What do they look like throughout this process? And how long would it take? (For the purposes of this question, let's just say that Viruses and Prions count as "alive", they are "killed" in this scenario as well) 

There are many methods that real world gaming companies use to stop people from cheating in their online games. Reduce the quality of their experience Slow down their in-game movement speed, take away their in-game money, anything of the sort that might reduce their fun with the game as punishment for trying to ruin it for others. A Server for nothing but Cheaters In one of the Marvel vs Capcom games, Capcom had a problem with people leaving the game early. So what did they do? If someone kept leaving games early, they would be put on a server filled with other people who kept leaving early. Something similar to this would be useful for your simulation. If they're going to cheat the game, then they may as well use it to cheat against other cheaters so that the experience isn't ruined for non-cheaters on the normal servers. Obnoxious Labelling This is a tactic that Payday 2 uses for cheaters. If someone is cheating in a game, above their head is displayed in huge red lettering the word "CHEATER". If this simulation is important enough, then this will be a huge source of shame and embarrassment for the cheaters, preventing them from wanting to risk it. Doing nothing at all Ironically, this might be the most effective way of dealing with them. If the Overseers simply watch for people cheating, then they can fix the bugs and hacks that they used to cheat the game. Once these are patched, then the cheaters won't be able to cheat anymore, but will still keep playing the game. Saving resources of the Overseers for fixing bugs and hacks rather than spending them on punishing players will allow the simulation to be uncheatable, and prevent future cheaters from using the same exploits. 

It’s worth noting that even fairly dark objects will reflect some light. Unless space elevator is completely absorbent (which is possible, as Vantablack is made of carbon nanotubes, but unlikely, as those are specially configured — vertically aligned, while surely a space elevator cable will be made of laterally aligned nanotubes), enough light will reflect to make it a streak of ribbon in the sky. It would probably stand out more on a cloudless night than it would during the day. Just as we cannot see Mercury as it traverses the sun, or a fly sitting on a car headlight, so a relatively thin object, no matter what colour or how reflective, will not be easily discerned in a bright sky. 

English grammar, I assume. And the answer is that it could be almost anything, as English is happy to adopt words from other languages, and demonyms are often highly irregular. If you are deriving the name of the people from the place (as does happen, sometimes), Bonfithian seems right. But compare Mancunian (Manchester), Liverpudlian (Liverpool), Londoner (London), Hollander (North Holland & South Holland), Glaswegian (Glasgow), Galwegian (Galway), Corkonian (Cork), Rohirrim (Rohan) to see some of the variability out there. If you develop a conlang, you could derive the English word from that of the conlang. Basically, the choice is up to you. You should consider the history of the kingdom, and think about where the name comes from. If the land is named after the people, then the people should have the shorter name; if the people are named after the land, then the name of the people will be longer: probably the land name followed by a suffix. Or the two names could be completely unrelated: consider the Dutch living in The Netherlands. 

What I'm thinking for this question is that some kind of filter is put around the sun by aliens that prevents some kinds of solar energy from passing through but allows other types. Like if it stopped visible light but allowed UV. Is there any way that the parts of light plants need for photosynthesis can be separated from visible light, allowing the plants to survive but preventing visible light from passing through? I've tried to do my own research on this, but all I've found is that they require a nonspecific "light", and I'm not sure if this means specifically visible light or all kinds of light, such as UV. For the question, assume that the barrier around the Earth can sort between different types of light, regardless of whether or not this makes any sense. EDIT: Close voters, I understand my question may be slightly difficult to understand due to the nature of what I am asking, however reading the answers below should allow you to see what I am looking for, and show that there are others who understood the question even if you didn't. 

Human disease will only affect humans. You might think a disease would spread rampantly among an alien population considering the effects Smallpox had on the south american natives when they were exposed to it. And while this is a perfectly reasonable assumption, it's also incorrect. It is almost impossible for there to be any human diseases that can affect the alien at all. The reason for this is that human diseases evolved to infect humans. Alien Cells would be too different from Human Cells for any disease to attempt to infect. For example, a Plant can't catch Smallpox from you. And while there is some precedent for cross-species infections as has been the case on Earth, these have been between animals that share a relatively recent common ancestor, like Cats and Humans, or Birds and Humans. This is why I said "almost" impossible, because there is a tiny, tiny chance it is compatible, but this is less likely (and less plausible) as winning the Lottery every time for about 100 years. But that doesn't mean that there's no way for you to make it plausible. Using something like the Panspermia theory, you could have the two species share a common ancestor, which would massively raise the odds of an infection. War of the Worlds can be considered incredibly inaccurate. Until, that is, you consider the theory that the Martians and the Humans are biologically connected from a common ancestor, which makes it just slightly more likely, and into the realm of plausibility. 

In a worldbuilding context, you have to think about what you’re trying to symbolize with your flag, and about the design tradition in which it resides. Does it come from an older aesthetic tradition, such as heraldry? If so, what does heraldry look like in your world? In our world, tricolours have a specific meaning. A tricolour means this country is a Republic. There are other traditions in flag design, such as the pan-African colours seen in many (but not all) African national flags. Similarly, you might be better off not designing one flag, but designing a family of flags, in conversation with each other. Work out their histories, and which came first. Flags change, as a result of governmental changes. Many national symbols started out as family or personal symbols of a ruler. When there’s a revolution or coup, the symbols can change (or can merge). 

You need to look at sign languages, which have non-linear elements and and have a somewhat tighter relationship between morphemes and phonemes than is found in spoken languages. If you were signing the bus went past me, you would make the sign for bus and then hold your hand in the “vehicle classifier” handshape, then with the other hand make the sign for me (probably pointing at yourself), then hold that hand in the “person classifier” handshape, then bring the vehicle past the person. (Example drawn from Irish Sign Language, of which I have slight knowledge.) The grammatical structure of the language is, as you can see, fundamentally non-linear: goes past me is all one action, made with two classifiers (handshapes which represent categories of objects (vehicles, people)), with the specific meanings of those classifiers (“bus”, “me”) established beforehand. (There is no indication of either tense or aspect in this little example, because I don’t know enough about ISL grammar to describe how they should be indicated; however, they are not necessary for my point.) Sign languages are perfectly capable of abstract expression, including philosophy and mathematics (inasmuch as any non-written language is capable of mathematics*). In English, phonemes can have inherent meaning: gl- usually means something to do with sight, as in glare, glint, gleam, glitter, glossy, glaze, glance, glimmer, glimpse, and glisten (or not, as in gladiator, glucose, glory, glycerine, and globe).** This sort of thing is usually obscure and not very obvious: most phonemes (sound units) in the language have no inherent meaning; morphemes (meaning units) tend to be multi-phonemic. In sign languages, the two tend to be closer: many morphemes are a single phoneme (hand shape, movement, touch, etc.). Iconicity (onomatopoeia) is to some extent a feature of all languages, sometimes quite abstract (see the bouba/kikki effect), and sometimes obvious (Wikipedia gives hiccup, zoom, bang, beep, moo, and splash as examples of onomatopoeia in English). There is some evidence that sign languages have a higher degree of iconicity than spoken languages, but by no means is everything iconic. Signs that were once iconic can be simplified down to basic elements such that iconicity is no longer apparent. Or the sign for light may be based on holding a candle. Or the sign may not be iconic at all (in ISL, the sign for day involves putting one hand on the chest and moving the other hand (in the shape of a clenched fist) down past it). Plenty of discourse markers are given on the face: raised or furrowed eyebrows, for example, or puffed cheeks, or direction of eye-gaze. And these may be held over the full length of a phrase (providing further example that sign languages are less linear in nature than are spoken languages). 

TL;DR: What tactics can a professionally trained army use against a horde of untrained conscripts using human wave attacks? (This scenario takes place in the very-near future.) Background information: The two forces of SEDA and GAU have been at war for the past decade, SEDA defending against the constant onslaught of GAU conscripts. Brainwashed and forced into service with minimal training and faulty equipment, the armies of GAU are nothing more than hordes of conscripts rushing blindly at the enemy (in a similar method to the Banzai Charges of WW2.) In modern history, human wave attacks have often failed and have only served to waste entire battalions by having them be cut down by machine-gun fire. However, the size of the GAU forces have the sheer excess of numbers to make this a viable strategy. They are vastly more numerous than their opponents, overwhelming their enemies with sheer numbers. The forces of SEDA are professionally trained and equipped soldiers, defending against the hordes of conscripts. While in normal scenarios this alone would be enough to counter such an unorganized attack, the sheer numbers of their enemy calls for a more specialized counter-strategy. What Tactics and Strategies can SEDA use to defend against this human wave attack style? Are there any formations or positioning that could help them gain an advantage? 

Most conlangs are the work of one person. Whatever the legalities, it would be odd to borrow them for a new work. However, there are ongoing efforts in many conlanging communities (such as Reddit’s /r/conlangs), to construct conlangs within the community, with no one owner, open for use by anyone. There are a couple of active projects on Reddit, and no doubt also a few elsewhere. 

Historically, it has often been the other way around: the land is named after the people. Hence the large number of countries whose names end in -land or -stan. To answer your question, 

A change in writing style is most easily explained by a change in language. If, perhaps due to some virus, the prevalence of deafness in the population massively increased, culture might change to one like Matha's Vineyard in the 18th to mid 20th centuries, where everyone, hearing and Deaf, used a sign language. Sign languages are not commonly written, but when they are, they are written vertically, in Sutton SignWriting. As the use of sign languages became more prevalent, they would probably be written more. Spoken languages would not disappear, of course, but as people became used to writing vertically, they might start writing their spoken languages that way too. 

You've got a space gun. There's no doubt this idea could work, as the article I linked will tell you. So essentially yes, this contraption of yours is entirely possible (as for whether or not you can use a Space Gun to launch a projectile unnoticed into space, well that might be a good idea to ask in another question, since that seems right up this site's alley) 

Life would exist very briefly, before exhausting every resource The recycling of elements is vital to how our ecosystem evolved into existence. Whenever an organism dies, detritovores return the nitrogen in the organism back to the soil. But if this nitrogen simply disappears with every death, it goes nowhere. It doesn't get returned back into the soil, and as a result the autotrophs would die out quickly after using it all up in the first era of the evolution of life. Life would exist, but not long enough for any complex life to evolve. 

Let's say you have the entirety of Earth's nuclear stockpile at your disposal (you don't have to use it all, and if you need it there's an infinite supply of extra ICBMs) and that every weapon you fire will have 100% accuracy as to where it explodes. Is there any way these explosions could take place without causing any environmental (or at the very least Limited) damage to the planet's environment? I'd imagine the problems with this would be that the explosion would either be too high in space for the EMP to affect anything, or too low in the Atmosphere to not cause damage. Am I correct in this, or is a (mostly) worldwide nuclear EMP feasible without causing mass environmental damage?
