Within the context of the debate, it's essentially a non-statement. As discussed in @CortAmmon's answer, this contextual confusion. Analogy: Multiplexing serial communications Most computers can be said to have a single serial port through which they access the internet. All of the data that comes in is like a stream of 's and 's, then gets streamed to various endpoints through multiplexing:             . The above multiplexer description is flat, though in practice multiplexing tends to be a hierarchical process. Anyway, details aside, it's then important for the communication protocol to sort incoming data into the various endpoints that ought to receive it. With computers, multiplexing tends to require precise framing. Part of this is that ambiguities can be exploited, allowing hackers to get undesired effects:     . With humans, our language tends to be far less precise, so while we must still multiplex our communications, the routing process involves a lot more inference. As given in the question statement, doesn't intend for the string to be parsed within the context of the argument. Since that string should never be routed to the argument in the first place, it has no existence within the argument; it's neither a fallacy nor a non-fallacy. At most, can say (in awkwardly precise language): 

You specifically ask about bullshit questions. By the above definitions questions are hard to fit into some definition of bullshit, because they don't impart meaning, but request it. Three ideas spring to mind: 

Some of the objections there don't really refute the reasoning. Take O2: second hand evidence from a consensus of scientists is a valid reason to believe something is true. It's the value of a scientific literature review. If multiple scientists saying the same thing was not enough evidence, consensus would never matter -- but it must, because the gradual proof of theories by testing against data is how the scientific method asymptotically approaches truth. Even further, O1 is flawed by similar reasoning. It's not the layperson's role in the scientific discussion to judge measurements -- rather, collections of people with the necessary training check the work, check the models against further data, and once everything's verified present those findings. The IPCC report is that trustable source. ...unless there's reason to doubt their findings! That, however, is a different line of reasoning. Once we're arguing about the IPCC's integrity, we're not discussing climate change but the trustworthiness of the people we trust with its investigation, and their integrity has no bearing on climate change. 

So, obviously, something must exist within a debate to be a fallacy within it. For example, someone can turn on a TV, but if that's not part of a debate, it can't be a fallacy or non-fallacy within it. The main point of this post is that folks might be confused due to the assumption that all words in an exchange in which a debate occurs are necessarily part of the debate. But, that's the basic mistake. Instead, people can exchange words, including having one-or-more debates, without all words being part of all of the on-going dialogs. This is like how a computer can play music from the internet while a user is checking their email; the email app and music app are both streaming info over the same serial line, but the music doesn't exist in the email app nor do the emails exist in the music app. 

By their summary, coherency etc doesn't really factor into the equation at all! All that matters is that the bullshit is said without regard for its truthiness. (Interesting question, then: can bullshit also be 100% true?) Full disclosure: I never finished the original Frankfurt paper, though I'd like to. Regardless of whether their summary is 100% accurate, I like it anyway: I think it's quite a pragmatic definition. For example, Pennycook et al devise a Bullshit Receptivity Scale, which is interesting. That work is specifically related to "Pseudo-profound Bullshit". They also detail two reasons why an agent might accept bullshit: a lack of ability to detect it, and a willingness to accept anything as true from the outset. It's a fun paper and worth the read. 

I will ask you another question in turn: should chess players think before they play a move? Another approach is that you might have had a change in your belief system or trust in something. You might need some time to reconsider in general and as every case comes to you again you will have to see it under this new light and find again what is a meaningful stance for you. Everyone should follow his inclinations I believe, that is the way to offer the most they can. Some people by philosophizing are the thought of the others, helping them coordinate while they run and move. How much you need to change by thinking or how much you need to act to change only you know. Nietzsche said 'We are a cold river for the warm hands of those who act.', or something like that. 

Not fallacies Fallacies don't apply in this situation since they're not attempting to formally prove that you're wrong or even asserting that you must be. This goes doubly so for: 

Detail on the multiplexing analogy Revisiting this answer, I'm not sure how obvious my multiplexing analogy may've been, so this section is meant to explain it a bit. The basic point is that a "fallacy" is an invalid construction within a debate: 

tl;dr- You're right, this is a common misunderstanding. While perhaps not particularly mature, calling someone a "bloody idiot" can be a comment outside of the context of a debate. Rather than being a fallacy or non-fallacy, such a statement doesn't exist within the context of the debate at all. 

Could the bullshit question be asked without caring about the response? For example, I could ask a question on Stackexchange but not care what the answer was, or even if there was one -- I'm just asking a question. Could a bullshit question be asked without caring whether the answer was true? In this case, I might demand an answer to my stackexchange question, but I don't care if the answer's right. I just want something to believe. This could be bullshit in that it solicits bullshit. I personally like this definition of questions-as-bullshit best. Could a question be bullshit if what it implies is bullshit? For example, "why are you wearing a red coat" could be bullshit if the subject was actually wearing a black coat. In that case, the person asking asserts something to be true in asking their question, and the assertion is bullshit. I feel this is closest to what Pennycook et al summarise Frankfurt's position as. 

Einstein was a proponent of hidden-variable theory. The gist is that, if something appears random, then it's really just chaotically dependent upon information we don't have. So, God (the universe) doesn't play dice. Subsets of it might, but Einstein held that a complete description of the universe would be fully deterministic. Any description reliant on randomness merely omits the hidden variables. 

Here, they're not making a statement. It's not even a bad question - if you don't like a product, then potential buyers might have good reason to be interested in why you use it despite not liking it. Rudeness isn't ad hominem There's a somewhat common misconception that rudeness is a fallacy; it's not. Ad hominem is where someone reasons something like: 

Because things that are not are more numerous and descriptive of being than the things we immediately see. While I am not well read in regards to Greek Idealism it seems that this definition extends the typical of what a form is as the essence of an object. In the idealist sense I understand the form to be a prototype object that every true object of this kind exist in reference to. Leonardo here uses a definition that is modern and mathematical in essence. An important dimension of mathematical work consists of identifying an object under question and abstracting it as much as possible in a way that the mathematical object could describe anything of that type. I.e. 2πr and 2π*r(squared) describe the geometric properties of any circle, not a specific circle, every cirlce. A circle with r = 5 meters we might have in front of us is not the essence of the circle because it is not every circle, but just one. The essence of the circle extends to the non-being circles that every existed and will exist. That is as with the being of humans, animals and trees. More will have existed and will exist than in our present and even more are their possibilities that will never exist but still would be described as human, animal and tree. In this sense the study of topology in mathematics is relevant, but only to a certain extend, because several geometric specific properties are included. Thus we can say that being and nothingness constitutes everything and there is a mathematical intuition for that. 

Yes, you can imagine new "colors", and there are physically meaningful complex colors that humans don't really see. Short version We see with our eyes, and those signals go back to our brains. We ascribe "color" to things that we see as colors are common patterns worth noting and exploiting, e.g. for communication. Since this question is about imagining a new color, sure, you can imagine a description that doesn't correspond to anything else that you've seen. In the absence of correspondence to physical reality, this would seem to be a pointless exercise, but there's no reason why you can't imagine it. Additionally, there're physically meaningful "colors" that we actually observe in science labs. However, you can't really "see" these colors directly as the human brain's visual processing center isn't wired to process them. Colors with more dimensions Another answer had mentioned the prospect of tetrachromacy which is sorta how animals with more sensory inputs can see things; they'd have a wider color space. However, this strikes me as a limited perspective because that seems to suggest that there's something special about seeing color in just 4 dimensions. You can perform a Fourier transform on a source of light waves to get infinitely many dimensions of color as opposed to just the 3 in human vision or the 4 in tetrachromacy. We've even built machines that do exactly this, i.e. Fourier transform spectrometers. It's somewhat difficult for a human mind to appreciate such complex "colors" in the same sense that we perceive normal colors though. For example, here's a very high dimensional color for a blue flame. Assuming that this plot uses 1 data point per /nm on the x-axis from 300/nm to 700/nm, then that's a 401-dimensional color. Even if you were to see the blue flame yourself, it'd look blue to your eyes, as your eyes don't have the spectrometer's mechanisms for seeing more. However, you can see the color through the spectrometer's eyes by observing the spectrum showed in the link. If you want to imagine it in your own eyes, it'll look like a blue flame, since that's what it is; but if you want to rewrite how your mind works, you might try to appreciate that it's a far more complex color than just "blue". Science note: The reason that we have such spectrometers is because more detailed colors can tell more about what you're looking at. In many labs, spectroscopy is the go-to method for identifying chemical compounds and other physical samples. Not much art When people talk about imagining new colors, I suspect that they're generally looking for something aesthetically pleasing. The problem here is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder; you can imagine a Fourier-transform-like visual apparatus, which would see in vastly more colors than humans normally do, but since imagining such complex colors would require a lot of work and rewiring one's own brain, it's doubtful that an observer would find aesthetic joy in it. Aesthetics seem to work best when an observer can relate to what they see on some level. Unheard of colors, such as high-dimensional colors from spectrometers, probably won't match up to this for most folks. Color blindness Some people can't perceive colors like normal, i.e. they're color-blind. At least in some cases, this results from the eyes lacking the physical hardware to pick up on some of the color signals. Looking through Google, it appears that some folks are claiming that they're getting close to a cure for some sorts of color blindness, presumably by fixing the eyes. Once a life-long color-blind person has their eyes fixed, will their brains be able to fully process and appreciate the color distinctions as though their eyes had picked up on the signals all along, or will their brains have pruned the unused informational channels?
