Not sure if it is what your looking for, but since you tagged it as philosophy of science...: Imre Lakatos developed a theory to weaken Poppers falsificationism. According to Lakatos, theories are never isolated, but part of chains of theories. Each part of a chain is a theory that shares with the other parts its hard core, consisting of theoretical assumptions that cannot be abandoned or altered without abandoning the programme altogether. To the hard core comes a weak hull, consisting of auxiliary hypotheses. Auxiliary hypotheses are considered expendable by the adherents of the research programme - they may be altered or abandoned as empirical discoveries require in order to 'protect' the 'hard core'. One feature of the theory of lakatos was that he allowed contradictions in the weak hull, as long as they are not permanent. In this sense he would allow an inconsistent physics. 

This depends to a great extent on what you think to be necessary. If you think that our physical laws are necessary true, then the answer is 'no, there are no possible worlds that behave that way'. If you think that our physical laws are only contingently true if true at all, there may be a possible world that behaves differently, and at which our secondary attributes become primary. Since you asked for impossible worlds aswell, and if impossible worlds are such that they include squared circles, and horses that are no horses... Then surely, there is an impossible world at which the secondary attributes of our world become primary. 

What other questions are regarded as fundamental (nowadays*) by contemporary philosophers? *Since this particular question is new in the sense that neither philosphers in the antiquity nor middle-age philosophers addressed it. 

It seems to me that you are reading the wrong books, essays, websites, w/e. For a start, you probably shouldn't read Armstrong et al when you are doing philosophy as a hobby for a few months. I do not mean to be an arse, I just think it is helpful to start exactly where your problems are, at the basic stuff. Consider me doing a bit physics as a hobby for a few months, now I pick up the latest Journal and naturally I won't understand a bit of it. Learning philosophy is a quite slow process. And it is not going to be any faster by skipping all the basics. Quite the opposite, you don't understand much and get confused by technical terms. There are books exactly for this situation, e.g: the Cambrdige Introduction to Philosophy-Series; The Math you need to do philosophy; Philosophical Devices; for logic check out this site: $URL$ There are almost for every discipline excellent readers, one being e.g.: The Philosophy of Language, by Martinich. It covers all the things you just mentioned, the most influential essays, good forewords that explain all needed vocabulary. As to my little example of me jumping into contemporary physics. The language of physics os mostly math. A lot of people, me included, don't understand a word (or number ;)). Think of philosophy as the same: Just because its language is our natural language, doesn't mean it is not as hard to understand as the physics-essay. 

You create evidence which should persuade any reasonable person of the veracity of your claim, You provide him a method by which he can verify those claims himself, and Your demonstration exposes underlying assumptions and sources of potential error so that your claims can be corrected by subsequent empirical tests if necessary 

Other methods of knowing things may not be universal or applicable in all cases. Some, such as deontological morality, rely on personal experiences, paradigms, or norms which may not be shared---and, in some cases, cannot be shared. Others, such as mathematics/informatics rely on axioms which may not apply to our physical, perceptible world. Empirical truths are, in some sense, the greatest success of philosophy because they can be accepted by anyone with an open, critical mindset. The primary problem with empirical truths is their limitations. There are many questions which we feel are important that cannot be answered by any empirical test. Many important questions have very few empirically-supported claims which can support an answer at all. It is seriously questionable whether empirical facts can ever fill these gaps. 

Human perception is known to be unreliable and occasionally faulty. This supposed problem is not a significant concern. A materialist would simply reply that either PR or PB is inconsistent with reality, and further data would be necessary to determine which is inconsistent. A materialist would ask: What is the wavelength of the light observed by the twins? If it is not known, how was it produced? If the wavelength is known or reproducible, the materialist would then identify which twin had faulty perception. If the wavelength cannot be determined after the fact, then there is no way to know the actual color of the light during the event. Disclaimer: Wavelength is a property of light, but color is not. Color is a percept. In a certain strict sense, you could argue that both twins are correct, and that their perceptions map to different real properties. This is a bit disingenuous if we accept the assumption that everyone agrees "blue" is 450-495 nm light and "red" is 622-780 nm light. That assumption is necessary to imply any sort of contradiction in the twins' stated observations. 

These deal with Modal Realism, and why it might be a bad theory. For alternative views beside ersatzism mentioned in Plurality itself, I just want to drop some names: There is Modal Scepticism (Melia: Modality ch. 3), Modal Fictionalism (Rosen: Modal Fictionalism, and Modal Fictionalism Fixed) and Modal Reductionism (Sider: Reductive Theories of Modality, sections 1-3) among, probably, many other. 

I am looking for contemporary proponents of the following thesis: Identity statements such as "a = b" are to be interpreted metalingustically, for example as "the names "a" and "b" are coreferential". (as opposed to: "object a is identical to object b") I know that Frege hold this view in the Begriffsschrift and that he argues against it in the beginning of Über Sinn und Bedeutung (On Sense and Reference). However, I'd like to know whether there are contemporary proponents who argue for a metalinguistic interpretation of identity statements. 

According to Chalmers, philosophical zombies are physically identical to each of us, but lack consciousness. By 'consciousness' Chalmers means the qualitative feel we often experience. The what-it's-like to be me, to taste apples, to fear ducks, etc. So, do zombies, by lacking this, already lack any mental states, or do they have mental states, but just no phenomenal states? 

The Münchhausen Trilemma is unsolved, because noone successfully solved it yet. There are, for all three options: Coherentism, Infinitism and Fundamentalism, philosophers who hold one of the views, but each faces lots of difficulties. 

There was a very popular documentary about gender-theory in norway. Roughly, the moderator, a famous comedian who studied sociology, asked gender-theorists questions about gender, nature/nurture and the like. Then, he travels to the worlds most famous universities and shows the answers to scientiests mostly of biology and psychology. They show him their empirical studies, which contradict the gendertheorists. The documentary can be watched on youtube for free, if you follow this link 

In Propositionals Logic 'Some cats are black', since it is atomic, will be formalised like this: 'P'. In Predicate Logic 'Some cats are black' will be formalised like this: '∃x (Fx & Gx)', which should be read as 'There is at least one thing that is both a cat and black.
