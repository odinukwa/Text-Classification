It doesn't matter that the milk tastes a bit funny, you're still going to drink it. The same with being a bit short on meat, if that's what there is, more so as a multiple birth animal, then that's what you'll eat, especially in an arctic environment. However most big beasts of burden have a lot of meat, it might be quite tough, but there should be a lot of it. Reproduction rate is too low, once or twice in a lifetime isn't enough for what's fundamentally a prey animal, that'll need to be every couple of years at least. Unless your world has no predators and this species has an unbelievable survival rate for newborns. Speaking of predators: How do they deal with them, do they have horns? Hooves? Both would come in useful. Why do they live so long when they can only breed twice? Very few creatures live on past the end of their breeding cycle. You should possibly also consider how females choose mates. Normally with herd animals it's one (or a small number of) dominant male(s) and the rest don't get much of a look in. The other part of this is of course, how do males impress females, do they fight, do they display, are they particularly charming in a bar, do they dance. Pair breeding is much more common in birds than mammals. Swimming: Pretty much everything can swim, often badly but they can. Unless you have a particular plot reason for them not to, let them swim. (Your world though, with a global belt ocean, the tides and storms are going to be epic!) 

We live in a world of young, isolated, single people, a long way from home and seeking even fleeting human contact. A pretty succubus on Tinder, no problem at all finding targets. As long as she makes sure they're single, and possibly unemployed, it's going to be some time before anyone notices they're missing. Flatmates are used to not seeing each other for days or weeks at a time as schedules misalign. Strange smell coming under the door? He never washed enough anyway, time to move out. Probably best not to stay in one place for too long once the bodies start stacking up, but there are plenty more cities, plenty more people living far from home looking for comfort. All in all, the modern world is a fairly comfortable place for a succubus to be. You're perfectly safe, as long as you swipe left on the demon. 

Hydraulics/Pneumatics: A push/pull cylinder on one side of a joint will give you the movement. Leverage is of course all wrong but it is with a human body anyway. Joint Servos: Servos are standard kit for certain tasks but they tend not to be massively high powered. Good enough for a bit of force multiplication but not up to full blown power armour. Artificial Tendons: A motor or servo pulling a cable on each side of the joint to give movement. 

Big sailing ships don't carry a lot of momentum and we're talking an area that's a full 10 degrees North-South and runs all the way round the world. Once you're stuck there you're stuck until the wind comes back. 

The 1 HumanPower car Consider the power of a horse, 745W. It's a lovely value that we're all familiar with under the heading of 1 horsepower. You're looking to power a car from a human (analogue). The sustainable power output from a human is approximately 200W1 or about 0.3 horsepower. A vehicle which runs with around 1/3bhp is not exactly a sports car. My power drill runs at 650W, circular saw at 1300W, the kettle is 3kW, maybe you could run an electric screwdriver but nothing much bigger. To generate power, people need to eat, to be able to output a horsepower, you'd need to eat like a horse. I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this, to output the power of a vehicle you need to eat like a vehicle. Energy is conserved. Just the controls Considering not trying to power the vehicle itself, just send pulses to the control system, steady use of this ability would still require considerable additional calorie intake for prolonged driving. My real problem is why did this ability evolve in a non-aquatic species? What's left? A control system that used the conductivity of a body, hands inserted into a fluid and changes in the conductivity used to control the vehicle, no problem, you can have a lot of fun with that. Your Amish group either have too low basic conductivity or for some reason can't control it. 

Secrecy by misinformation. You need to generate some sort of plausible explanation for how you're doing what it is that you're doing. As long as it sounds reasonable you can get your enemies buying up all the carrots they can get their hands on. In terms of general maintenance and release to users. If you consider the people who put your phone together in the factory, they don't really know how it works, they have a set of parts they put together in a certain order. The people who test them don't really know how they work either, they know the inputs and what outputs they're supposed to get in the test environment. Only a very small number of people need to know the real details of what's going on, the rest are looking for loose contacts, broken circuits and burned out components. 

*This doesn't affect the flow rate, just the flow speed, but it makes it easier to visualise. **In river terms, barely a trickle, but easy to calculate. 

At the end of the day, given modern medicine and behaviours, while you could still potentially manage a pandemic, it's unlikely something will get established the way the Black Death did. 

An example of this being: I will ban the death penalty, against public opinion, because I think it is fundamentally flawed. (Note "self imposed" is not an externally imposed code like religion, it's also imposed on the self, not imposed on others.) The key to both of these is emotion and empathy, if the AI can't recognise and understand the emotions and distress of others then it will not understand moral behaviour. It must be able to enjoy seeing joy in others, and feel or at least understand their suffering when they suffer. 

Not really. Traditionally when an army ran low on supplies, the men would start eating the mounts. When an army with bears starts to run low on supplies, the mounts would start eating the men. This could be really bad for morale. Conventional domesticated herd/pack animals tend to remain passive when hungry, bears not so much. 

Average Joe, without military information available, would most likely learn about the missile when he looked up and saw it coming towards him. Much as the average person is only aware of aircraft movements as they pass overhead, the same would be true of Joe and the missile launch. He'd either hear about it on the news when the information became public, or see it with his own eyes. His best bet is to join the military in the section responsible for detecting missile launches. Nothing unethical, just a career choice. 

Contaminate the coal supply As is tradition, Santa gives coal to the bad children. A contaminated coal supply would allow Old Nick to use Santa's logistics to give targeted distribution of the virus and give himself the night off. 

Ships in space and basic shielding Any combat ship in space has a problem, it has to be strong enough to endure without significant damage, a simple impact with an object at very high speed. You can try to maintain our current system of ships that need to be as light as possible to maneuver with the drives we have, but to build ships of the type you're asking for, new drives are required. To consider the building of combat ships at all you're now considering a massive increase in orbital debris in a short period of time, you're going to have to build to a spec that can withstand such impacts. This makes big heavy ships with potentially limited maneuverability. Somewhere along the line is an ideal point which will withstand the impacts and still be able to move, but the basic requirement of construction means that dumb ballistic weapons are largely useless. Radiation shielding How much does it need? How much radiation from a solar storm, how much from a nuclear explosion at close range. The former is what you're shielding against as a baseline, the latter is what it has to resist in a combat situation. Lasers This is the only one on your list that the ship doesn't need resistance to just to be able to operate in the situation you've described, meaning that this is could equally your baseline for ship to ship weapons. However their power is often limited, if I can defend against it by putting a bit of roll on the ship so the beam doesn't remain in one location for long enough to cut through, this weapon equally becomes useless. Smart magnetic missiles with shaped charges This is the way I'd actually go in practice. Rather than impact based weaponry I'd develop a missile that magnetically clamps to the outside of the target ship to ensure that the shaped charge has the best chance of penetrating the hull. Nuclear is not required, a conventional explosive with oxidiser that works in a vacuum is quite sufficient if correctly applied. 

(I've never been able to trace this quote) Should this be a repeat problem rather than one quickly solved with an arrow to the knee, then a royal monopoly on purchasing anything that comes out of the labyrinth should be easy to establish. On Puzzleville A town that springs up in a place like this could at best be described as a frontier town. Its population is going to be the people who know that the way to deal with a gold rush is to sell shovels, it's going to be thieves, prostitutes and innkeepers. The borderline mass murdering, grave robbing, temple looting, "adventurers" who pass through are not going to be people you want in your country. The best thing you could do with a town like Puzzleville on your patch is to kill it with fire. Then salt the ground and put in a permanent garrison to stop people accessing the labyrinth. You do not want the people who gravitate to a place like this in your country. If this labyrinth has suddenly cropped up in the heart of your territory and you're looking for a way to exploit it then you have to take a different approach. The town should be a military town, the entrance to the labyrinth tightly controlled. Who knows what could come out or try to get in. The garrison should hold a full kit inspection for anyone going in or out. Nobody is allowed in unless they are adequately equipped and experienced, all persons coming out again must submit loot they haven't chosen to use for inspection and purchase, at a good price, by the garrison quartermaster. The garrison itself should be equipped from this source. In return the adventurers passing through should be allowed access to the garrison facilities, catering, accommodation, smiths for armour repair etc. Only the most mundane and mildly magical toys should be allowed onto the open market. 

Time travel breaks cause and effect. Making a profit depends on cause and effect. As long as you're the only person doing this and you do it carefully on a small scale, you should be ok. Once it gets out that this is possible and people start doing it on a large scale, economies collapse, cause and effect collapses, the concept of "being rich" collapses, and ultimately the entire concept of one thing happening before another also collapses. That's in a universe which allows grandfather paradoxes. In a fresh timeline universe at least the rest of us are protected from your madness. In a predefined, no free will universe, you did it because you always had done it, so you had to do it when the future came and nothing is affected. 

Not all magic is incompatible with all armour. Nature magic and leather armour are fine as the druids and shaman will explain. Holy magic has no problem with full plate as any paladin will tell you. The problems are frost, fire, and necromancy. There are some obvious factors. Metal is heavy, mages tend to spend more time in the library than the gym and hence would have some considerable trouble moving around in 40lbs of armour. There are some secondary factors for frost and fire. Metal is a really good conductor of heat and often doesn't respond well to extremes of temperature. Some metals freeze and shatter, or contract excessively when cooled. Others will go soft at high temperatures and become useless as armour. The mage would certainly be more comfortable with better insulation rather than the extra weight of shattered half melted metal, and that's before even being hit by anything. Necromancers are an entirely different game from your average frost and fire mages. Necromancy just doesn't work if you don't look cool enough. It's all about those robes, gotta look good. 

If they're avoiding both the heat of the day and the cold of the night then there are dawn and dusk people. Most likely you have four main groups, two who move constantly and two who move and settle for long periods. The dawn tribe will move until they start seeing stars, then it's time to settle until the heat of the day catches up with them. The evening tribe will move when the first stars of the evening start showing as the signal that the temperature is going to drop. Both these groups will overhaul the constantly slow moving tribes in their sectors when they move and those who move further ahead at dawn or stay later in the evening will tell stories of the heavens lighting up with stars at the extreme of the survivable temperatures. 

In terms of actually making your fortune, take crafted aluminium goods back to a point where aluminium is valuable, sell for gold. Ensure that you're handing small quantities of high value goods, you want to make as few trips as possible for the greatest gain, selling only to the richest people in society. You certainly don't want to be moving large volumes. Buy land, buy it when you are. You should be able to pick up large swathes of now valuable, but then worthless, real estate in places like London and Manhattan for a song. Set up trusts that lease the land and allow it to be developed while keeping the freehold and taking ground rent. The present day wouldn't notice as most people are barely aware of who actually owns the freehold on a lot of that land.
