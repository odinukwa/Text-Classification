The Japanese built the largest submarines in World War II (52 out of the 56 submarines) of over 3000 tons). These were also able to stay underwater the longest, over 100 days, and carried the best torpedoes. Some 41 subs carried aircraft. The reason for these innovations was that the Japanese were operating in the Pacific, the largest ocean in the world. Despite these advantages, the Japanese submarine fleet had two problems. The first was that the Japanese built onl 174 of them. The second, and more important reason was that they were used to fight warships, not merchant ships, and also to resupply isolated Japanese garrisons, so 128 of the 174 were lost in combat. The survivors were mostly new or training ships. 

In large part because she asked them to do so. Almost no "king" would do this. But Maria Theresa was a woman, and a young, attractive, one at that. So she turned her woman's "weakness" into a strength. Her father had paved the way 17 years earlier, by making large land grants to Hungarian nobles for signing the so-called Pragmatic Sanction. But a large part of (unexpected) support at the time came from their love of this branch of the royal family. (They had rebelled against one of Maria Theresa's uncles.) Maria Theresa's address reminded them of that. 

Herbert Hoover was 54 years old when he became President. He was a natural born U.S. citizen who spent the first 21 years or so of his life in the U.S., and most of his adult life abroad. But his childhood years counted toward the "14." As pointed out by another poster, the Constitutional requirement is for "fourteen Years a Resident within the United States." That means 14 total years, not 14 consecutive years or 14 years immediately prior to becoming President. 

With some adjustments, occupied and unoccupied France was based on the limits of German penetration during the war itself. A stretch of the Atlantic coast was handed over to Germany, even though not occupied, while some German-occupied areas along the Loire River were handed back to the "rump" French state in compensation. Germany offered to adjust the border further in favor of the French state if it chose to locate its seat of government in Orleans (instead of Vichy). Basically, France was divided north and south under German and French occupation, as shown in the maps posted by others. Northern France was directly governed under a German military occupation regime based in Paris,with the coastal areas under a separate authority. Southern France was nominally independent, but generally acceded to German wishes regarding the rounding up of "undesirables," and other matters, and therefore was seen as a "collaborationist" regime. It had its own police force (which was often used to do the Germans' bidding), and retained its navy (in Toulon and elsewhere), and a small "army." This nominal "independence" basically ended when the Allies invaded North Africa, and the Germans occupied Vichy France as well, erasing the former boundaries. The French fleet in Toulon was scuttled by its crews, rather than handed over to the Germans in this second occupation. 

Canada is part of the G-7. (Along with Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.S.) In this regard, Canada IS a world power. But not all world powers are in the G7. (Russia, China and India come to mind). 

I am of the opinion that Joan of Arc, an "amateur" general, started France on the road to winning the war because she understood something that the "professionals" did not; that is, that the French army was fundamentally better despite the earlier English victories, and that "all" that was needed to win was for France to fight the right battles. My understanding is that the French had better artillery, a multiple of the number of English troops, and as a result, a wider range of weaponry for "combined arms" operations. The English had superiority in only one area, the long bow, which they had used to devastating effect at Crecy, Poitiers, and Agincourt. England's alliance with Burgundy mitigated, but did not eliminate, the French advantages. The above is the general sense that I have, but my knowledge its a bit sketchy. Can anyone describe the French vs. English advantages with a greater degree of "granularity?" And if so, is it fair to say that Joan's gift was realizing that the French could win, under any reasonably competent "combined arms" commander (which she had behind her) even more than understanding how they could win? That is, of course, if the French could avoid battles and situations where the English long bow would show to advantage. 

In large part, it was due to Japan's choice of allies in the two world wars. (In both cases, Japan was a "junior partner.") In World War I, Japan's main ally was Britain. That country preached (but didn't always practice), the concept of "fair play." Nevertheless, Japan accepted this "Western" concept in order to fit in, because Britain's allies represented"most of the world." In World War II, Japan's main ally was Nazi Germany, a country that was fighting against "most of the world," and adopted an "anything goes" policy against most POWs. Germany's views actually coincided more closely with Japan's natural cultural instincts. It's true that the Germans treated "American, British, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand" prisoners quite well, and that their brutality was toward other prisoners on the eastern front. But Germany did this because it wanted to take on Britain (and possibly America) as junior partners in its "New Order." Japan, on the other hand, wanted to expel the Anglo-Americans from its "Greater Southeast Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," which is why it treated Australian, English and Americans as badly as they (and Germany) treated "other prisoners. 

A medieval knight in armor on a horse (with stirrups) was easily the equal of five to ten "peasants with pitchforks." That's because riding a horse would give the rider a momentum that was a multiple (three, four, five) times that of someone on foot. Basically a knight could "ride down" one peasant, turn around the horse, and repeat the process several times. If there were enough peasants, the horse would run out of wind" before they did, but the required number of peasants was probably closer to ten than to five. As for peasants grabbing the knight's legs or arms, forget about it, if he's on a horse. The peasant who did that would be "dragged" to his death. Even a knight in armor without a horse, but with a spear or lance was worth several peasants with spears but no armor. The knight could initially kill one or two peasants with little or no damage to himself. Even if they "overran" him, it would take much longer for a peasant to strike a fatal blow against an armored knight, than for the knight to kill an unarmored peasant. The knight could kill "several" before they finally overwhelmed him.

First, I would say that Lithuania was less colonized by the Soviet Union, meaning that we are only making a comparison with the other two. First, Lithuania is less accessible than the other two. It has less coastline than Latvia, and much less coastline than Estonia (before World war II, most of the Soviet Baltic fleet was stationed at Talinn). Also, Lithuania has much more forest and fewer roads on the eastern (land) side; the other two lands are much flatter. Basically, there was less incentive for the Soviet government to "settle" Russians in e.g. Lithuania's (inland) capital of Vilnius than Riga (Latvia) or Tallinn, Estonia. Finally, Lithuania, unlike the others, had been a major power during the Middle Ages, first in its own right and second in the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth. On the other hand, the Latvians and Estonians, during the same period, had had the experience of living side-by-side with colonizers such as the swedes, Poles, and yes, Lithuanians, as well as the Russians. 

Here's a link to 36 USC Section 301, regarding the national anthem: $URL$ There are a number of references in the code about the "military salute." It seems like the Star Spangled Banner was chosen for its "martialness." The Olympics probably weren't a factor. The song was adopted by an act of Congress in 1931, a year in which there were no Olympics. 

Stalin probably didn't believe that Israel would go "Communist," because there was no ideological connection between Communism and Zionism (except that a few people were in both camps). Stalin probably believed that Israel could become his "catspaw" in the Middle East. The reasoning would be "the enemy of my enemy is my friend." Stalin did not treat Jews particularly well in the Soviet Union. For all that, the Soviet Union deserves a lot of credit for the defeat of Nazi Germany, the persecutor of the Jews. Stalin was hoping that some of that "credit" would "rub off" on Jews and Israelis. Stalin and the Soviet Union feared the Moslems, particularly the Arabs. The Israelis were the natural enemies of the Arabs. Stalin hoped (with reason) that the Israelis could keep the Arabs tied up on the Middle East, diminishing their threat to the Soviet Union. Basically, there was some reason to hope that the Soviet Union and Israel could become "fellow travelers," not "fellow ideologues." 

A large number of Indians came to East Africa from Gujarat in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A smaller number came to modern Tanzania than to Uganda or Kenya. The reason for the larger number to the other two countries was the importation of laborers for the building of the Kenyan Ugandan railroad. The ones who went to Tanzania were mostly traders, which is to say that they travelled in relative comfort ("business class" if not first class) on the ships of the time. 

In their book "Generations," William Strauss and Neil Howe argue that there is a correlation between economic crises and American wars. A decade-long economic crisis "no taxation without representation" in 1765-1775 led to the American Revolution; the Depression of the 1850s led to the Civil War, and the Great (and global) Depression of the 1930s led to World War II (with America being one of the greatest participants in both the depression and the war). 

I am recasting the question as follows: "Among the people who helped make the decision to drop the atomic bomb, were they mostly privileged Ivy Leaguers or were they all Trumanesque "school of hard knocks" graduates?" Truman formed the so-called "Interim Committee" in May, 1945 to help him make this decision. I find it interesting that the two southerners, James F. Byrnes and Paul Clayton appear to be "school of hard knocks" graduates, while the northern-born men were all privileged Ivy Leaguers. The latter included former Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, Ralph A. Bard, Undersecretary of the Navy, Dr. Vannever Bush who headed the Manhattan Project, Karl Compton., James Conant, and George Harrison. I can't identify any historians that have done the kind of biographical research outlined above, or made the observation cited in the original question, but I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that someone had done one or both. 

What are the differences between the "line ahead" and "line abreast" formations in naval warfare? Which is more likely to lead to the (advantageous) of "crossing the opponents' T" (or being crossed)? 

Independence was declared in July, 1776. That was a political act that basically superseded other days connected with the war and peace, such as October, 1781, or January, 1783. The main choice of dates was between July 2, 1776 and July 4, 1776. The first date was the one on which the "heavy lifting" was done, and that's why John Adams expected that to be Independence Day. But it was on July 4, 1776 that the declaration was ratified, that is "signed, sealed, and delivered." Put another way, that was when it became "official." 

In 1941, future President Harry Truman reportedly advocated a "bait and bleed" strategy that, "If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia, and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible." General George Patton suggested re-arming 26 German divisions and working with them to kick back the Soviet armies toward the Soviet border. These views were not "official" U.S. policy, but in fact were held by officials that were high-ranking enough to lead people to believe that it could become U.S. policy.
