I don't mean to disappoint you but planets are already charged - all bodies in space have a voltage that depends on their immediate environment to the degree that they interact with it through the interplanetary medium, which transfers charge to an extent. Being isolated most of the time, they develop a potential compared to other objects due to the balances within their immediate environment being satisfied but by not having contact with other objects, their relative potential doesn't balance because their charges don't interact. This is why in electronics and electrical engineering, two points cannot be compared in terms of their voltage, unless they share a point, usually ground. An example would be two batteries - while the voltage between their ends can be approximately the same (lets say 5V), if they're isolated from each other completely and you place a wire near them with a high enough voltage to overcome air resistance (say, 50 kV), against one there might be a spark, but not against the other, at the same distance (provided you kept the wire at a constant voltage). While this is unlikely to happen in the same room, due to the air balancing out charges through interaction and friction, it is possible to observe this difference experimentally. The ground in England is not the same ground as in Italy - but the voltage between the ends of batteries will be. In much the same way, if two celestial objects where to pass close enough to each other to interact electrically, there would be huge lightning bolts. You don't see this often with asteroids because they don't often pass close enough to other objects and because given enough time in the same environment, their effective potential balances out. But to answer the question, a planet can and does have a net charge - it's not something exotic, it would be exotic if it didn't. 

Based on this information, 1/5 of Earth's gravity would not be much more than is seen on the moon (i.e. Earth's moon), so a little larger than that seems reasonable: 

You'd need a pearl the equivalent size to a 13g lead ball for a standard flint-lock pistol. However, lead has a specific density of around 4-5 time that of pearl (~11 vs ~ 2-3), so a pearl of that weight would be too large for the pistol, while one of the right size (for the calibre of weapon) would - I assume - be too light to deliver the same impact. Pearls themselves are fairly tough, so propelled at sufficient velocity would be damaging. You might just need a custom weapon to do so. The biggest problem of, course, would be finding sufficient pearls to use as ammunition, and addressing the question of why you wouldn't exchange each pearl for a wagon-load of lead-shot ammunition for your flint-lock musket or pistol? EDIT: Expanding on this a little, in a constructed world it might be that pearls are more readily available, and/or deliberately harvested (and marketed by a particular culture or population. @ohwilleke (in comments) suggested particular vulnerability akin to werewolves and silver bullets - if this existed it could create a market for 'pearl bullets'. Taking this further, if pearls are somewhat toxic to a particular target - and given that small pearls will be more common than large pearls, perhaps they could be used as 'shot' (i.e. multiple small projectiles per discharge) rather than as a straight replacement for musket balls - this would increase the likelihood of hitting the vulnerable target (given that pre-rifling, accuracy was poor), which might be important if its something as dangerous as a werewolf. While I've not been able to find any reference to use of shot in flintlock muskets or pistols, there is a passing reference to this for the arquebus, so it has some plausibility: 

Prejudice is just statistical inference applied to human behavior. By observing the behavior of a sample of people that share a common and easily identifiable characteristic (skin color, tatoos, unique cloths) you can predict the behavior the population from where the sample was taken. In your particular example lets say I am a member of elite and I only know one unhealthy person. If that only person I know commit murder, I have no choice (because I don't have any other information) but to assume that all unhealthy people are murderers. I am aware, as an intelligent person, that my evidence do not prove it but if I have to make a decision (trust or not to trust, allow or not them to stay) I must base my decision on the currently available evidence. That is where discrimination takes place. Based on the available information and also based on the impossibility (even because of lack of interest and also lack of resources, and that includes time) of getting more information (in other words: because knowing the ultimate truth is not possible) I will adopt a discriminatory policy to reduce the likelihood of being hit by the undesirable behavior that I am expecting from the unhealthy people. Discriminatory actions are very convenient because they normally comes with zero cost to people that applies it. Only the objects of the discriminatory actions are more severely affected so from the elite point of view it makes all sense and not doing so would in fact be irrational. 

It would be easier for such mating rituals and colouration to evolve, given the absence of predators, but whether or not it does depends on intensity of mate competition, and the balance between inter- & intra- sexual selection. 

Evolutionary game theory explains why different behavioural strategies can co-exist in a population. Initially developed by John Maynard-Smith & George Price, it was used to address the existence of non-lethal aggression: why should an animal display but not fight over desired resources? This is the 'hawk-dove' model, with two strategies: "hawk", which means fight until the opponent withdraws, and "dove", display, but run away if attacked. Bypassing all the analysis of this model, the outcome is that both hawks and doves can exist in a population if the cost of fighting is higher than than the value of the resource, and the particular values for cost and value determine the stable proportion of hawks and doves in the population. $URL$ Note that at the stable proportion, both strategies do equally well. (for a recent treatment of hawk/dove models: $URL$ Applying this to the question, we can consider "Mage" and "Magician" as two genetically-encoded (inherited) strategies (making the reasonable assumption that "bright and willing" intelligence/personality has a genetic component). By analogy with the hawk/dove model, Magicians can only exist if the costs of 'fighting' are greater than the value of the resource over which two individuals might 'fight'. The question suggests that status is the resource, and Mages can be extremely lethal if it comes to a contest (whether this is toe-to-toe fighting, attacking from the shadows, or something more subtle). Mages always win against Magicians, so Magicians should always beat a hasty retreat if they come across a Mage (or at least conceal the fact they are Magicians). So the evolutionary game theory answer to the question is that Magicians exist because this is an equally successful strategy to being a Mage. The only issue that needs to be determined is what proportion of Mage vs Magician is stable! Of course, things are slightly more complicated, because the population actually consists of three genetically-inherited strategies: Mage, Magician, and 'Normal' - 'Normal' loses out to both strategies - but the basic conclusions remain: at some proportion, being a Magician is just as successful (in terms of producing 'descendants', here, more Magicians) as being a Mage is at producing more Mages, and that is why there are Magicians despite the existence of Mages. 

Would it be possible for a planet to have a geometry that allows relatively stable orbits beneath the surface? I understand an artificial object could achieve this just fine, given the technology, but could a naturally formed planet either have the structure to allow for this or be carved out in such a way that it remains stable while allowing this? By "relatively stable orbit" I don't mean a circular one nor one that doesn't require periodic corrections, simply one that could count as stable enough that a modern satellite could use its thrusters to correct it for its operational lifetime (10-20 years). Obviously this would require the planet to lack an atmosphere. However, I'm wondering if specifically, an atmosphere-less planet with a vast subterranean cave that spans its underground would allow for this. Would it require rocky columns? If there was no physical connection between the underground and surface would it hold together? 

That's 40km in radius ( (2+2)*10 = 40km ) and 3km in height ( 0.3*10 = 3km ) link many thanks to Liath for revealing this online gem That's pretty flat. I used Kelly Thomas's approach and compared it to a geological feature, but a hill instead of a mountain since this is a lot less steep. However, it turns out the tallest hills are about 1km tall and still cause rain shadows despite the flatness. Here's some examples: 

Could an empire like this survive? No. With no external threat, and the only uniting sense being that they can communicate with one another (and are governed by 1 - essentially remote - leader), this 'empire' will not last. Resources are finite, and individuals will compete for these. Individuals who can get an edge over another individual will - on average - take that, and if not for themselves, then for their family, clan, social group etc. At some point, your different peoples will come into conflict, and the 'empire' will collapse. Your setup also relies on beneficent emperors, and both history and modern politics show that this is unreasonable. The longer an individual remains in power, the more power they draw to themselves and the more likely they are to become - well - less beneficent. Even if you have a single life-long altruist as emperor, what is to ensure that the successor is similarly minded. I doubt this 'empire' would exist for the lifetime of a single emperor, and would certainly collapse over the reign of multiple emperors. To hold a group of disparate peoples together requires a strong within-group identify ("We are all citizens of Rome"), together with some strong laws, and the ability to enforce them, particularly with regard to those who are dissidents. Look at the 'life-cyle' of historical Empires - Rome, British Empire. The only hope for your empire would be either existential threat from outside (commonly in sci-fi this is an alien race/invasion) to counteract the natural tendency of internal factions to favour their own, or a state of utopia, where all individuals are satisfied with their lot in life, which would not be particularly realistic (in that it doesn't match with what we know about the behaviour of humans or other known species). 

A weapon that consists of 2 devices, one is installed in north pole and emits a very narrow (1 nanometer diameter) beam of neutrinos and the other one is installed in the south pole and emits a beam anti-neutrinos. Neutrinos and anti-neutrinos do not interact with either matter or anti-mater so both fluxes can pass through anything and everything. A super precise technology allows the beams to be directed with incredible precision. When both beams crosses the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos reactive with each other releasing a great amount of energy. The project is kept in secret so nobody know such devices exist. When they want to kill someone all they need to know is their precise location in the world and make the beams cross in the target. Doesn't matter if the target is inside a box of steel with 10m thickness walls, there is no safe place. 

If your planet rotation axis (north pole - south pole) is directed to the star then at that pole time would always be noon. I would expect this place to be super hot, specially if combined with the other characteristics already mentioned. 

The big problem (or advantage) is that red giant light spectrum is shifted to infra-red and micro-waves. It would be way less ultra-violet light. So considering the habitable zone the one that will receive around the same power/surface area, it would be more heating light than ionizing light. I would guess the life forms would have to adapt to this condition. For example current live beings wouldn't be able to produce vitamin D. But the production of ozone would also be reduced and since the ozone filter the UV light things could balance out a bit.
