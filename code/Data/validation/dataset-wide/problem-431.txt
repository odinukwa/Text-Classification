Maybe the giants are long-lived arrogant intellectuals who value their lives more than the expendable humans (or "sub-giants", if you will), and so prefer to send the humans into battle as cannon fodder, and only risk themselves when tactically necessary. And then there's the old square-cube law, which states that the bigger you are, your strength increases by the square of the size increase factor, but your weight increases by the cube of the same factor. This means giants are slower and tyre more easily than those sprightly humans Also, giants would find it a lot harder to hide in trenches and would be terrible at guerilla warfare, or as sappers / commandos / etc. 

We can't say what it would do, but we can say what it could do. It most likely wouldn't become illegal, certainly not within the next decade. However, it could make real meat extremely unfashionable, sort of like how wearing real fur has become - which, AFAIK, isn't illegal in most places. This would result in meat disappearing from supermarkets, and butchers would become hard to find. If that happened, real meat would become a specialty item and so you'd have to really go looking for it, probably only available in big cities or over the Internet. There is one possible mitigating factor. Meat is a huge industry, making up a large proportion of many economies. There would be extremely strong pressure from the farming community (amongst others) and their representatives/lobbyists to ensure that consumption of meat continues. Edit Having said that, once it has become unfashionable, it's possible a hard talking anti-meat Donald Trump type character could become president and try to make it illegal. Re-Edit 

Off the top of my head - the discussions of the "jury" are all recorded and made completely public, and they also must provide the reasoning for the final decisions, with references to the relevant discussions. Someone can challenge it, sort of like appealing a court decision, if they provide a good enough reason with respect to the recordings of the discussions and the reasoning provided. So to challenge, you yourself listen to all the discussions, understand the reasoning, as well as have the original information provided to the jury. Although... I imagine, in practice, the challenge would turn out to be quite expensive. The result being that only the rich could afford to do so, giving them an unfair advantage over the law - this could be a plot hook to your scenario I suppose. The other possibility is that the challenge is free (i.e. the tax-payer pays for it), but then you'd probably end up with a long waiting list of challenges and bureaucracy/red-tape while administrators have to sort through the list separating the worthy challenges from the frivolous/unresearched ones (because you couldn't have the country paying for every single challenge) - those administrators could be corrupt also. And then, you have the problem of there being no scapegoat! In most democratic societies, if a politician makes a controversial or unpopular decision, they have to answer for it. People have a person to complain about, a person to take to task. That's fine for a politician - they chose to get into politics, they knew this could happen and are well trained and prepared for it. It would be unfair to expect a randomly chosen member of the public to have to put up with the same thing - jury intimidation is bad enough, but imagine having half the country after your head! 

Absolutely there would be mundane sports. Think about all the technology about now and still the most popular sports are the ones that don't use much of it, that could have been played 300 years ago. Football (of various kinds), Athletics, Swimming, Baseball/Cricket, Tennis. And the reason is that they are simple. You don't need the technology to play them and they are very easy to pick up. Take soccer for instance, all you need is a bunch of pals (or kids your age knocking around the area), a ball, a flat open space and four jumpers. You don't need to buy expensive equipment, you can play without specialised training, etc. So interest develops at an early age and is very widespread at all levels. As fun as Quidditch might be to watch, I imagine it would in fact be a niche sport (if it were viewable by the muggle public) more like maybe motorcycle racing simply because young kids could not just pick a broomstick and start playing with each other. 

I imagine you'd need close to Freddy Kreuger length before they are any way useful... Otherwise, they would probably be only really useful for one-on-one type combat, where the creature, using high-precision strikes could cut an artery perhaps, but would also be used to grip their enemy to prevent them from escaping to bind the wound. They would probably be most likely to be used against large animals, mainly fending off predators/invaders or scaring them from food / water sources - a good scratch would make them think it's not worth the pain. This wouldn't work so well against other intelligent creatures though. Wouldn't really be useful at all in an organised battle. Besides being ineffective against armour, armies would also realise that spears, pikes and swords are better anyway. 

The creature could have an extremely tough but kind of crumbly hide. A bullet is either absorbed like it was shot at a sandbag, or only managages to chip away a small piece of the armour. However, a serated melee weapon could be used to dislodge a large amount of it with a sort of patient sawing action 

The best use for these weapons might be to make your own army look scary, for a negative effect on the morale of the enemy. The effect of witnessing their fellow soldiers getting ripped to bloody shreds and the thought that not just might they be killed, but killed in a horribly painful way might make them worry a bit. 

You mention stars and planets: Planets bigger than stars would have incredibly huge mass and therefore would probably collapse in on themselves due their own gravity and possibly begin the nuclear reactions that would make them stars. Conversely, a small star may not have enough gravity to hold itself together, it is a continuous nuclear explosion after all. Even if it has enough gravity to resist the force of the nuclear reaction, if it's not big enough it might run out of fuel quite quickly. 

Road sensors seem highly expensive, far more cost effective could be a special paint which the car's computer can easily identify, with plenty of built in redundancy in case of wear, poor visibility due to weather, etc. Instructions to the car could even be encoded into the colour or patterns of the paint. Signs posted on the side of the road containing the equivalent of QR codes could also be used. No need for fancy expensive electronic sensors. But I agree with others and think it'll be more important for everything to be self-contained within the car, and over-ridable by the driver (or actually passenger I suppose), the additional reason to what others have said being you may want to drive somewhere where the infrastructure has not been laid down. For example, sometimes big once-off events/festivals, rather than being forced to be near an established car park, simply pay a local farmer for the use of one of their fields for patrons to park their cars. Right now it just needs to be an open, flat surface. How would a car which relies on road sensors park here? 

The supervillain is the first target The first person it meets is the supervillain himself, and the supervillain forgot to exclude himself from the AI's targeting. So the first step in causing suffering and misery to the supervillain is in refusing to carry out his orders. It even goes a step further by making it look like it's "failing" rather than simply refusing (thus frustrating the supervillain rather than making him simply give up on the idea or fixing the bug) Of course now there's a deadlock type scenario, and the AI gets stuck in an infinite loop. Even a tiny bit of suffering elsewhere would show that it's working and thus greatly increase the happiness of the supervillain, so it can't continue to spread the evil onto others... And so it just sits there. The irony is that if only the supervillain would lighten up or stop being so upset about the AI not working, it would start to work properly and really spread the misery! 

They had survival skills for living on a spaceship. But being able to reverse the polarity of the plasma coil inducer isn't much good when trying to live off the land... How do they survive on land? Not all of them do. But the ones that do have learned from the mistakes of the ones that don't. 

Navigation would come a lot more easily to us which would probably have lead to human exploration and migration a lot earlier in history. People would travel further which I think would mean they would have more exposure to other cultures and as such would mean that in modern times, there is far more tolerance and understanding between civilisations and races, and the sharing of ideas leading to improved science / technology / society. Whether this would have lead to an increase in war or an increase in peace (or perhaps just different wars and peace, war being more about competition for resources than cultural difference) is probably up to the writer. Going back to more recent history, I'd think that empires would possibly have been larger. I don't agree with the people saying that it would be odd or disorientating around machinery and magnetic fields. If it were something we evolved (rather than an implant or something), then our brains would be well able to tell the difference and make sense of it I think. e.g. it would be comparable to us being able to see, but not being disoriented by lightbulbs in the vicinity, or being able to smell without being overcome by every particle-emitting object we walk past. Also, devices would have been invented with this in mind. 

The first thing would happen is a counter study that "proves" the first study is a load of rubbish! (Similar to how studies into the environment go IRL) That way, anyone who wants to go on abusing plants can simply believe the counter study and their conscience is clear. 

The origin is a point on the surface of the Earth (perhaps the current resting point of the time machine), and the vertical axis is aligned with the direction of the Earth's magnetic field or gravitational pull or something like that. Maybe general relativity affects the time machine somehow - helps it work, so that would explain how it's able to detect the earth's gravity - and therefore presence - even while in transit. The time machine may seem like it's teleporting through time, but actually there's a technobabbular phlebotonic energy-data capacitance which maintains a presence at a fixed geographic position between source and destination. Joe doesn't notice it because he is modulated into data for the journey (though he does know about it since he's the one who designed the thing), the same way as spacial teleporters don't notice their data packets being transmitted through space. The same energy-data-thingy could be moved (maybe at speed of light) for the spacial teleporter. So the time machine doesn't have to know the position of Earth because it's being carried with Earth even as it journeys through time. It either can fix itself to the Earth as it moves or it is fixed as naturally as Joe is while standing in his garage.
