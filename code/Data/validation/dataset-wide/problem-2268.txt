This is highly dependent on the type of water as well as the location, but I'll summarise a few things to be aware of. In many locations most of these dangers won't factor in, but they're useful things to bear in mind if you're trying to assess the danger of a particular body of water. I'll focus on the sea here - for other things such as rivers similar things apply (but there's obviously other things to look out for, different kinds of wildlife, waterfalls, etc.) Currents: Yes, there are areas of sea that can "pull you in". (The same obviously applies for rivers here, but this is less commonly thought of with the sea.) More dangerously, there are also currents that can "pull you under". Similarly, and sometimes just as dangerously, there are areas of the sea that can "pull you along" the coast horizontally. This can sometimes be dangerous simply because it's much easier to miss, and can pull you into dangerous areas such as: River outflows: Along the same guise as currents, but these can often hide at full tide and seem to appear very suddenly and strongly if you move into them. Quicksand: Not often thought of when you're in the water, but if you decide to stay on the bottom for a while and hit a patch of this, it can root you to the spot. Watercraft: Again, something that's often missed, but stray jetskis (for example) can seriously injure or kill you if they hit you full on. Hidden depth: While you can often expect beaches to fall down at a gentle angle, there are often hidden areas that can suddenly drop away. While not an inherent problem if you're a good swimmer, these can often be associated with undercurrents too - so beware. Personally I'll only swim on beaches I'm familiar with at high tide (and have seen at low tide) to try and mitigate this somewhat. Wildlife: This varies greatly - some areas can have deadly sharks (or similar) in them, and these risks go without saying! However, bear in mind more common things such as jellyfish (some of which will just give you a nasty sting and others that can be lethal) and crabs (which will give you a nasty nip if feeling threatened.) Know what lives in the waters you're swimming in, and be prepared accordingly. Sharp rocks: This goes hand in hand with wildlife in that sharp limpets can also live on rocks, making matters worse - but just because the entrance into the water looks sandy, doesn't mean it is all the way through. If you swim at high tide and stay in while the sea recedes, you may find yourself painfully clamouring over all types of nasties. Same goes if an unexpected large wave throws you against such rocks. Pollution: Like any body of water, you should be aware of pollution - especially after storms many runoffs will quickly head into the sea containing a variety of toxins and bacteria. In some countries / areas factories are still permitted to dump waste into the sea directly, in this case I wouldn't even risk getting in the water! 

In general, worldwide this is very hard to predict unless you're an expert in the subject (and therefore likely wouldn't be looking for advice on this page!) There are some clues, like plants with milky sap tend to be poisonous - but applying these in a general context is almost always a bad idea since your life can depend on it. The best you can do is to read up, get a good book etc. that focuses around the area you're hiking to - get one as specific as you can, with good, clear descriptions and pictures. This will enable you to have at least some degree of confidence - though obviously unless you're 100% sure I wouldn't risk it. 

In short - be sensible. Make yourself easily seen and heard, don't walk near somewhere you hear gunfire, and where possible stick to open areas on clear, marked paths. Of course, I'd also question the wisdom of hiking somewhere when hunting is happening; if there's a sensible alternative that seems like the logical option. In terms of where to look for information, look up the local authority's website and from there you can usually find the various times that you need. If you can't find it then find an official contact and send an email, they should guide you to the right place or be able to provide the information needed. Preparation in due course is key here. On a related note, if you're talking about army training / live fire then stay out of the area entirely when this is going on - it'd be stupid (and most probably illegal) to stray into such an area. North Dartmoor in the UK for instance is an area where this happens, but the information on times is easily available online, it's clearly marked on maps and there are clear posts on the moors to indicate the boundary markers for these areas too. 

If I find myself caught in a sand storm, what should I do? Should I sit it out, or try to keep moving somehow? Can this depend on the severity of the sand storm? 

I would agree with this advice, and perhaps wrap a few bags around for good measure (if they're available and I could do so without getting any loose bits in the way.) Yes, some water will still seep through, but you're fording a river where the aim is to get to the other side as quickly as is safely possible - you shouldn't be in there for a "long time!" 

Disclaimer: I'm also talking from the perspective of not having any experience in packrafts, but more from a general survival standpoint. 

Probably as expected, advice varies wildly depending on whether you're talking about relying on charging the batteries for a life / death situation or it'd just be a "nice to have" if such an option was available. If it's for emergency purposes then just bring a spare set of batteries - or more specifically, one more set than you calculate you'll ever need. These can be rechargeable as well, but if they are make sure they're relatively new and still hold their charge well (this is especially important because in cold temps rechargeables that are a bit worn out can sometimes fail completely. I've had it happen a couple of times!) Another option is to take a wind up torch - ok so it's not specifically recharging any old batteries, but it does provide you with a source of power limited only by how much you're willing to turn the thing. They're not that expensive these days either - I remember when they first came out and they cost hundreds... anyway... In terms of actually constructing a recharging station, the simple way would be to purchase a solar powered battery charger such as this one (I'm aware you can't actually buy it from there anymore but you can see the type I mean!) You could also make something yourself out of solar panels - and equally potentially make something to work with the wind or flowing water. Unless you're just doing it for fun though I'd be tempted to say don't bother - the size of those contraptions is generally much more than several sets of even D cell batteries, let alone AA, so unless you really don't trust batteries to stay charged or you really rely on going through a heck of a lot of batteries, it's still probably not the most practical option. 

When walking alongside eroding cliffs in more built up / touristy areas, there's usually big warning signs or closed paths if the cliff is unsafe to walk on. Sometimes it's obvious why, if the path is very close to the sea or has disappeared altogether. If walking in a more rural place though, it's likely that the cliff isn't inspected regularly and therefore such signs don't necessarily exist. What should I look out for, if anything aside from the obvious (big cracks, paths perilously close to the edge) to determine if such a path is relatively safe to walk on? 

Is there anything else I should consider? And would you recommend purchasing one, or building your own in terms of value for money (and considering I'm comfortable with electronics?) I'm mainly looking to use it for night hiking and night geocaching. 

Make sure to thoroughly clean and air it before storing, especially for long periods of time - this will get rid of any damp and thus should help prevent mould. Aside from that, make sure to keep it dry and away from large temperature fluctuations (a loft isn't ideal for this reason.) 

Build a tripod with 3 branches, then make a platform with 3 more about 1/3 of the way up the tripod. Prepare a tinder bundle and kindling as you would for a normal fire (dry grass, small bark flakes and moss for the tinder and small, dry branches for the kindling.) Once you've got the basic fire going, green, leafy branches and damp moss can be used above the fire to produce a lot of smoke when the flames hit them which should act as a good signal. If you've alerted search & rescue and you're waiting for air support, prepare the fire so it's ready to go but don't light it right away, wait until you can hear them coming, especially if you're in a situation where you don't have much fuel. 

I'm not sure I've seen an x hour hike advertised that hasn't been a round trip (unless explicitly stated otherwise.) This makes sense since a round trip is what almost everyone will be doing, and if it was the other way around and someone didn't realise, potentially dangerous situations could ensue! EDIT: As Vorac points out, this clearly isn't always the case as I first thought - so it pays to check! 

I always try to avoid taking much delicate on a hike, but sometimes it either can't be helped or I decide I want to take it anyway (camera would be the prime example!) How can I best pack such equipment in a rucksack to avoid it getting damaged or broken on a multi-day hike? 

As in the title, when going Geocaching what are some standard implements and tools I should carry with me to get started so I'm not caught out? 

All types of berries are your answer here! Pretty much any (edible) variety contains a large amount of vitamin C - blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries for instance. (Blackberries and raspberries seem to be especially prevalent at the right time of the year here in the UK.) And they're tasty too. Of course, it goes without saying if you're not 100% sure what a plant is then don't risk eating it. 

Unfortunately, if you're in really humid territory then it's inevitable that some condensation will form, though there are steps you can take to reduce it: 

When your hands are cold then your nerves will adapt to the cold, so lukewarm water will often feel boiling hot if your hands are freezing (the old hand in hot water, hand in cold water then both hands in warm water trick shows this.) As to why water hurts but a dry heat doesn't, I suspect this is predominantly because water is a much more effective conductor of heat than air, so water at the same temperature will warm your hands much more suddenly than warm air, not giving your brain time enough to adapt to the change. It's similar to the reason why it feels much colder putting your hand in ice cold water rather than surrounding it with air at the same temperature. A secondary, though I suspect lesser reason is that you can easily move your hands closer or further to a hot air stream, so there's much more of a continuous temperature gradient where you can choose to put your hands (and again this helps with the gradual change.) With water, it's pretty much an instant change. 

There's no general rule of thumb that I know of... I lied, there is Naismith's formula as correctly cited in another answer. I just tend to stay away from it because more often than not I find it better to make a judgement on the individual situation. There's so much variation the "average" would almost always be wrong in any specific case! It depends on all sorts of things, from the fitness of the individuals involved, whether the individuals are talkative and thus (usually) walking slower, how often people require rest breaks, how long those rest breaks are, any health problems that could impede progress - and so on. Having said that, if you think the hike is average-ish in terms of conditions, you don't have a better way of judging and all you're using it for is wondering when you're going to reach point x (for reasons of curiosity not safety) then it does have its place! More experienced hikers that know their speed, ability and fitness can have a rule of thumb for themselves based on weather, terrain and so on, but this varies again varies from person to person. It's even hard for experienced hikers to make a guess when they don't know the area or the terrain - sometimes land that looks easy going on a map can be rocky, boggy or just plain awkward! Where this kind of question does come into play most often (at least that's what I find) is when either hiking out for the first time, or taking inexperienced people out for a hike (because you obviously have to go at the pace of the slowest person.) For this, and best on the fact I generally wouldn't recommend climbing ridiculous terrain for this type of outing (if nothing else it'll put them off!) I tend to have in my head a rough average speed of around 3 KPH. It's slow - but far better to have that in mind and get back early than have a faster speed in mind and get back late, especially if after dark. It's not just the safety aspect, it's the morality as well; if you give people an estimated finish time and you complete an hour ahead of schedule they generally view it as an achievement and therefore a more positive experience overall! (Of course, don't take this to ridiculous levels. If you plan an all day hike that takes half an hour, people will just feel a bit misled!) Another thing to point out in relation to this, if you have a speed / route in mind and you realise it's over-ambitious, don't be afraid to change your route so it's shorter. Much better to cut a bit off and have a successful day than push yourself and end up getting lost or injured. 

In fact, I've found just putting them on and putting up with the cold for the first few minutes isn't that bad an option when you're used to it. It feels horrible putting them on, but after doing that and running around the tent a few times (which helps me wake up also!) the discomfort soon disappears. 

I've seen walking poles range from <£10 to >£100 - and to a casual observer there doesn't often seem to be much to distinguish them, with both having good grips and shock relief / suspension. What makes one better than the other, and is it worth investing in one which is more expensive if it's going to be extensively used? 

Generally speaking, straps and buckles don't just fail one day, you can see signs of wear a while in advance. Of course there are exceptions and you should arguably be prepared for these too, but giving the essentials a glance over once in a while can't do any harm. As a general pointer, bear in mind your use case as well. If you know your pack is about to endure a tough 5 days that would stretch it even when new, bear in mind that anything even minor that you spot could give way suddenly - so fix and replace when you can rather than taking the risk. In terms of the time to replace the pack, I'd say it's when multiple things start failing within a short time frame. A strap coming a bit undone once? Fair enough. A strap coming undone, couple of zippers failing and a small hole appearing in a month? Replace it.
