I have just started barbell training following the stronglifts 5x5 program. Since I am having some problems with the squat I am taking some lessons from a personal trainer. In the first session he measured my mobility and found that I have poor dorsiflexion in my ankles. He suggested some mobility exercises. I also have the book "Becoming a Supple Leopard" and in it I find several other mobility exercises for the ankles. When doing squats I also tend to get pains in my adductors. Looking in the same book I can find several mobilizations for the adductors. However, are not both my trainer and the author missing the point? I watched this interesting video on youtube: Why Stretching Isn't The Answer by Dr. Quinn Henoch. He basically argues that poor flexibility is the symptom. Poor strength (in another muscle) is the cause. Another interesting video on youtube makes the same point Improve Squat Mobility Instantly Without Stretching Following this video it seems that front planks could help with the pain in my adductors. This seems plausible since I am terrible at them. I also think that training the adductors will help: Adductor Work for Added Gains and Construction by Adduction. For balance I should then also train the antagonist which would be glute medius I think. For my ankles I think standing on one leg style exercise will help. I think mobility exercises are important, but only in conjunction with strength training of the neglected muscles. As an example I trained my adductors yesterday for the first time ever probably. My range of motion was horrible. But if I combine mobility with training the adductors, they will gradually relax and normal range of motion will be restored. 

I am learning the kettlebell double handed swing. Reading about this and looking at youtube videos I get the impression that this is difficult to do right. That was until I came up with the following theory: the kettlebell double handed swing is basically a vertical jump with an added pendulum movement. Do not force the pendulum, just let it do its own thing. Further I think that the deadlift is basically a slow version of the vertical jump. So in term of explosiveness: deadlift < kettlebell swing < vertical jump. Except for this all three are basically a hip hinge movement => roughly the same. 

I am a 44 year old male that have been a bit inactive the last years and am looking to get more fit. I have always been fond of running as a way to get some cardio, fresh air and reduce stress, but I am starting to get worried about my knees. One problem in this respect is that I am quite heavy (100 kg) although I have not much body fat. I recently read "Your New Prime" by Craig Cooper. He is strongly opposed to long distance running for men over 40. In fact he advocates the 5k as an ideal bench mark distance as opposed to the marathon. That is if you can run the 5 km fast then you are healthy. If you can run the marathon fast you are not healthy. His reasoning is as follows: long distance running reduces musclemass and lower your testosterone levels. This is exactly the opposite of what you need since your muscle mass and testosterone levels decreases each year after 40. This seems logical and plausible. I have verified his claims about muscle loss from age and long distance running from several other sources. However his suggestion about training towards the 5 k is not something I have found elsewhere. It sounds reasonable and practical but I have one worry: the force on knees and other joints increases with the speed. Not sure what is most dangerous for knees though: high volume or high intensity? The expression is high mileage knees, but on the other hand I would be worried about running a 100 m as fast as possible with little warmup in my age but not 20 years ago. He also like so many other advocates high intensity training. There are lots of studies done in the last years showing how time effective this. Which is great, but high intensity sound possible dangerous. I have not seen any studies of possible harmful effect of hit such as possible irregular heartbeat. 

I am a 44 year old male that want to maintain and improve my flexibility. I think it would be helpful with someone showing me the exercises so I have searched for courses in my area. Have not found any general flexibility course, but a lot of Yoga classes. From what I gather there are many types of Yoga. I would be interested in taking such a course if it was practical and pragmatic. I am not interested in any eastern philosophies or flow of energy or other mysterious concepts. I want to know: which muscles are we stretching now, and how do we do that. Also I am not interested in extreme flexibility. Just normal flexibility. I think anything above normal flexibility would be dangerous: $URL$ and also I have no interest in it. Also my focus is flexibility (and balance). Strength I get other ways. A little bit of meditation could not hurt. Do you have any type of Yoga you could suggest for me? 

I am trying to understand the workings of Greasing the Groove (GTG) method (youtube video) With this method you should only do 50 % of the max reps you are capable of but do as many sets as possible every day and with minimum 5 of minutes break in between. In hypertrophy training on the other hand you are supposed to go to failure and you may only have to do 1 set twice a week ("The 4-Hour Body"). Also the exercises should be performed slowly (5 seconds down and 5 seconds up). So to me GTG sounds like the exact opposite of hypertrophy, which would make it pure strength. This would also mean that almost all progress is neurological adaption. Is this correct? Does this mean that the rep count should be low (3-5)? I see some youtube videos of people trying to go from 50 to 100 push ups by doing 25 several times a day. This does not sound like pure strength or even hypertrophy but more like endurance training. So I am confused. Also what should the tempo be in GTG? I understand that in strength you want controlled down (loading phase) and explosive up. What is the use of GTG for ordinary people? I would think this would be how an olympic weightlifter train, but for ordinary people it seems impractical. I could imagine this being useful for getting past sticking points such as going from a very few to 10 pull ups for instance.
