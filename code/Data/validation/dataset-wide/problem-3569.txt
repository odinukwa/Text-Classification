JohnP's answer is good. To answer the question directly - probably 2 years would be safe - but it's kind of the wrong question. Tim Knowles' book contains plans for a nice progression from no running at all through to finishing the ~90km Comrades Marathon. It starts by training for 10km, then a half, then the full marathon and then the ultra. Each stage is, from memory, about 4-6 months. That plan has be scientifically evaluated and shown to work pretty well and not have many injuries. Going faster than this is likely to cause problems. I say that it's kind of the wrong question to ask. I believe people are ultrarunners because they enjoy running. They do it for a variety of reasons (and, if you were to dig deep enough, some of those reasons are about being able to brag) but they're more motivated by the joy of running and being part of that community. So, instead of wondering how long it's going to take, I'd just get out there and start planning to run a 5km or 10km well. 

I agree with others who have commented that you have to target fat loss all over. While exercise can be somewhat helpful, fat loss is probably 90% diet so you should focus your effort there. Many have had success with relative ease using Tim Ferriss's Slow Carb Diet so I would recommend that you give you that a try. 

I've been running in Vibram Fivefingers for about 4 years, first in a pair of KSOs then in a pair of Bikilas. My typical run is 4 - 6 miles. I agree with Mike but wanted to add my experience to this question. When I switched from KSOs to Bikilas the pad over the Achilles tendon on the Bikila irritated my skin. The upper of the Bikila has a good deal more "structure" to it and this made the rubbing even worse. Even after my skin toughened up it would still be irritated after a run. For this reason I prefer the KSO, though I am still running in Bikilas. I wanted to get the Bikila LS but they are designed for wide feet and mine are narrow so I had to pull the two sides completely together to get a snug fit. My next pair will probably be a brown pair of KSO Treks because they will look better when I feel like wearing them with jeans. Learning how to run like a human is key to running in minimalist shoes. You can find some really good information from Harvard's Skeletal Biology Lab" barefoot running page. There is also a great video summarizing this work on YouTube. I used to run a mile or two barefooted each time I ran just to improve my form but I quite doing that last year. My feet never seemed to toughen up enough for regular 4 to 6 mile runs on concrete and asphalt, though I could run the occasional 5K barefooted without issues. 

Yes, absolutely you can overdo it with electrolytes. It's called hypernatremia. The best resource I know of is the 9-way table by Karl King. This shows the effects of being under-, over- or normally hydrated and being under-, over- or normally salted. It shows what the symptoms are and what the treatment is. This table is really useful. You can tell if you're in this state because salty foods will taste bad. Your body would be telling you to stop. Gatorade is rather unlikely to get you into this state because it's isotonic. Its concentration is the same as blood so you would need to add external electrolytes to start getting into hypernatremia. If you're looking at training for 100mi or 24hr events then you'll need to start experimenting with the regime that works for you. Gatorade probably won't because its strong sweet taste becomes unpalatable after a few hours. Karl King is a scientist who studies these issues in details and supplies hydration and electrolyte products. He's a little controversial in the ultra world in that he's banned from the ultra mailing list for pushing those products without specifying that he has a financial interest in them. 

I would guess that by running exclusively on a tread mill you developed a stride that relied on the forgiving surface. I run exclusively in minimalist shoes (Vibram Fivefingers) on pavement with no complaints now but I ran in traditional running shoes for over a decade and had occasional knee or plantar fascia problems. I also spent about five years running almost exclusively on gravel and during that time I had pretty severe knee pain any time I ran on pavement. It is clear to me now that my old stride included very hard heel strikes while the stride that I learned running in minimalist shoes does not. I can take off my shoes and run the same way barefooted with no discomfort (until the abrasion gets to the soles of my feet :-) Learning to run in minimalist shoes would probably require more of a commitment than you would want to take on, but I recommend visiting this Harvard web site on the biomechanics of foot strikes to get an idea of how to run with a forefoot strike, then practicing that with the shoes you wear now. If you can modify your stride you will likely relieve much of your pain. UPDATE: I just noticed the additional info you added. Running down steep hills definitely generates the hardest impacts so you should avoid them as long as you are experiencing pain. You could also consider walking down steep hills. Also, take plenty of time to recover between runs, perhaps several days. If you do not want to skip exercise for that length of time substitute walking between your runs. UPDATE 2: I should have linked to this video originally. It gives you a nice overview of the information you will find at the Harvard Barefoot Running website. 

If you want to be a runner then leg exercises in the gym aren't going to help you much. You will get better running specific strength adaptations by doing hill repeats. However, your goal may be to build leg muscle for other reasons. Some coaches believe that running lightly the day after a long run helps recovery. If you're really going for distance then a normal training technique is to do back to back long runs. This means learning to run when your legs are tired but definitely prepares you for ultras. 

For the goals you state, I recommend focusing on reducing your body fat. Most reasonable healthy people have a nice six pack but it is hidden under body fat. Adding mass will not do much to make those abs more visible. By far the most effective tool for doing this is your diet. I recommend a high protein, low carbohydrate diet - basically a variety of meats and vegetables, avoiding starchy vegetables like potatoes. A good diet might be Tim Ferris's Slow Carb Diet. Of course you should continue working out, but I think diet will be a much more effective tool for your goals. 

I've never found it possible to consciously breathe in through my mouth and nose at the same time. I recommend just opening your mouth and breathing. The deeper down you take the breath the better off you'll be but I wouldn't be artificial about it. This is one of the things that will naturally develop for you as you train. Lastly, I would note that sometimes the stitch is caused by a different pattern of foot strides to breaths - e.g. because you're running up or down hill. Often, the stitch can be fixed by consciously changing your striding pattern to something different. 

As I understand it, you want to expand beyond the "power stroke" and consider pedaling in a "full circle". Starting just past the top of the stroke around 1:00 you would drop your heel slightly then gradually extend you foot somewhat during the power stroke, then extend it further at the bottom, sort of "flicking" the pedal across the bottom. Then, you would pull with your hamstrings during the "back" of the stroke, driving your knee up and pulling your toes up slightly as you go to prepare for the next power stroke. At the top you would flick your foot forward then repeat the whole cycle. It is easier to understand if you attempt each of these while pedaling a bicycle. If feels pretty natural after a small amount of practice. I would not necessarily say this is the "most efficient" way to pedal, but that it is the method that produces the most output. When Mountain Biking I use the full circle to accelerate or climb short hills. On a long hill I alternate emphasis from the power stroke to the back stroke to shift the load around while climbing. On a mostly level road I pedal full circle to maintain the maximum sustainable pace. You can read a lot of detail here. 

Your feet are sliding when you forefoot strike? That's the biggest clue. I don't heel strike going down hill because it hurts. It also seems very strange to put all that force into the heel and stop my motion when I can forefoot strike and keep things moving forward. I think what's happening is that you're moving a bit too quickly for the traction offered by your shoes. I'd consider checking the tread on the ball of your shoe to make sure it's not too worn. To control traction downhill you can use techniques like: 

I have a similar build and I have an idea to test, but I'm at a point in my life where I am not that motivated to test my idea so why don't you test it for me ;-) It isn't actually my idea, I got it from Tim Ferris and you can read about it on his web site here or in his book, The 4-Hour Body. Generally speaking, your workouts would consist of one set of a relatively small number of exercises, performed until complete failure 1 or, at most, 2 times per week. This is failure like you have never pushed yourself to experience before. As I recall, Tim does basic strength training exercises like dead lifts, squats, etc. but I have some friends doing this on machines and it is probably safer to do this way, though perhaps not quite as effective. It amounts to a shockingly small amount of time in the gym followed by a lot of recovery time. Your diet consists of large amounts of protein. I could go on, but Tim Ferris can fill in the details with much more authority :-) 

If you have concerns about your heart rate then I would see a doctor. However, I wouldn't be concerned about the numbers you present above. I've run half-marathons with my heart rate sitting on 170bpm (at age 25 and I was 5'6 and 140 pounds). I must temper that statement by saying that you're taller and heavier than most runners but not by enough for those results to be concerning. 

Swimming is much more about technique than fitness or body type. I'm a fan of Total Immersion. I used Triathlon Swimming Made Easy to re-learn how to swim in order to swim much better. This system makes you think about what you're doing and gives you fantastic tips on how to do it. The second idea is to join a masters swim club in your area. That will get you lots of swimming, against friendly competition and you may get coaching as well.
