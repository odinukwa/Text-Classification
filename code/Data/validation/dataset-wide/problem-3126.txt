Thus it was legal to homebrew cider or wine as long as it was "not intoxicating in fact". The burden of proving it otherwise was placed on the Bureau of Prohibition, who decided to simply ignore homebrewers. This effectively legalised homebrewing in general. 

Japan did have naval forces at the time, and they probably fought the Mongolians a few times. The samurai Takezaki Suenaga, a gokenin from Higo in central Kyūshū, was a veteran of both wars. To showcase his valour in battle (to request rewards from the government), Takezaki commissioned the Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba, an illustrated account of the Mongol invasions. Notably it contained several depictions of Japanese ships and naval battles. 

They didn't end up in any one particular place. In more recent decades, discovered skulls are generally returned to Japan, or disposed of in various ways (lack of identification). Certainly at least some would have been gotten rid of (through burial or otherwise) since WW2 was still ongoing. American authorities did not officially approve of the practise. Though enforcement of the ban was lacklustre, from the beginning some trophy skulls were ordered disposed of or reburied. In the early post war years, several skulls were discovered both thrown away as garbage or in the possession of former soldiers. Beyond moral implications, possession may provoke murder investigations or breach state laws, all of which encouraged quiet disposals. 

Luodian was a centrally-located transport hub between Shanghai CBD, Baoshan, Songjiang, and Jiading. Holding Luodian was vital to supporting the Chinese position in the whole region. Conversely, losing Luodian seriously threatened to undermine the whole front, since Japanese forces could strike at the heart of the Chinese forces via the roads from Luodian. In addition, Luodian was squarely on the path to the Shanghai-Nanking Railway. If the Imperial Japanese Army took Luodian, this vital rail link would have been directly exposed. The National Revolutionary Army fighting in Shanghai would be at risk of being cut off and encircled. For these reasons, Chinese forces hunkered down to defended the countryside surrounding Luodian even after the town was lost. However, the numbers you cited strikes me as a high overestimate; unless it included other Japanese units fighting in the region, in an effort to link up with Luodian and thus outflank the Chinese position in Shanghai. 

Poland wasn't actually "spared", it was merely less affected than the rest of Europe. That graphic is incorrect (or rather, incomplete), since a substantial number of both Poland and Milan's population did in fact die of the plague. Their death rates were only "low" in comparison to the rest of Europe - if it happened today, it would be horrifying to us. 

However, your is probably only using this crest for decoration. As an unusual and relatively more elaborate crest, it is suitable for the 's original role as a decorative pattern. 

It was probably approximately 155cm for women, and about 168cm for men. We have direct evidence for this from analysing the skeletal remains of the Romans. For example, in a study [1] of 927 adult male Roman skeletons between 500 B.C. and A.D. 500, Professor Geoffrey Kron of the University of Victoria found an average of 168cm. This is corroborated by remains found at the ancient towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii. Both cities were infamously destroyed by the A.D. 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius. A study of the remains left by their unfortunate Roman residents tell us that: 

However there is no real way to be sure about their purpose. Some suggests, for instance, that a row of the dots counted the number of days between equinoxes. 

Political Repression The Socialists were not quite as hard hit as the IWW, but the machinery of government came down harshly on the party as well. At the direction of Postmaster General Albert Burleson, Socialist newspapers and magazines such as the New York Call or The Masses were deprived of their second-class mailing privileges, their editors charged with conspiracy to incite mutiny and various such crimes under the Espionage Act. Rather than provide protection from vigilantes, the police instead harassed the Socialists. 

The Nationalist government also extended its influence over the Guangxi Clique, and to a lesser extent other peripheral regions such as Tibet. However central government control was weak, if not purely nominal. The Guanxi Clique for instance could not be ordered; the government had to rely strongly on good will and common antipathy towards the Communists. 

Due to their location, the Marquesas Islands in general are uncharacteristically dry for tropical Polynesia. It is no coincidence that all inhabited islands in the archipelago has elevations over 1,000 metres. At these heights, precipitation could be captured relatively reliably by the island's topology. The elevation of Hatutu is only 404 metres, in contrast. Unsurprisingly the island looks rather brown and almost barren, paradisaical rumours notwithstanding. See for example this photo of Hatutu's coast hosted on Google Maps, and also:

This was effectively an indefinite threat hanging over the heads of royalists, who were portrayed in the answer as a disaffected minority. According to Samuel Rawson Gardiner, 

It should be noted that cuirassiers were by no means uncommon during the question's time period. Despite their drawbacks, most if not all the major armies of Europe maintained cuirassiers at some point in the 1700s and 1800s. Their popularity did wax and wane, however as late as 1872, an article in the United Services Magazine noted with some wonder that: 

This alliance was maintained until A.D. 660, when Baekje was conquered by Silla and the Tang Empire. Upon request by Baekje loyalists, Japan sent an expeditionary force to help restore Baekje independence, but it was annihilated in 662 during the Battle of Baekgang. Afterwards, Japan resettled the Baekje remnant within the Japanese isles and retreated completely from the peninsula for the next 900 years. 

The oldest Biblical manuscript is Papyrus P52 containing a fragment of the Gospel According to John. It dates to around 100-150 A.D., and is usually cited as from 125 AD. It has been alleged that a fragment of the Gospels According to Mark dates to the first century, but as far as I know this has not been authenticated officially. 

And yet he makes no mention of this war breaking out in the following letters. Instead, two days later he wrote: 

In general, people fight over thrones because of the power it represents. For Japan, the tennō was not particularly powerful in the first place, but moreover lost secular power quite early in Japanese history. For most of the last 1,200 years, true political power was decoupled from the imperial title. Hence while many factions fought for power in Japan, most did not seek the throne itself (although internally branches of the imperial family jockeyed for the position). It was not worth it in the first place. Secondly, though lacking true power, the throne - and by extension the imperial line that monopolised it - were the source of legitimacy. Japanese political landscape was extremely fragmented and fractious, and governance tended to default to a more council-like system of rule. So-called ruling clans usually controlled only a relatively small territory, no more than 25% of Japan at the peak. They derived authority over the rest of Japan from the sanction of the imperial court, which remained recognised as the legitimate government (even after it had ceased any real function). An ambitious samurai lord might force the court to install a candidate to his liking as the next emperor. He could not reasonably make himself the emperor and benefit from the legitimisation that ancient office could provide. The tennō was not just the sovereign, but also a high priest the Japan's native religion - a position somewhat akin to the popes of Europe, in that it carried significant religious, ceremonial and symbolic functions beyond being a mere political leader. Consider how in the Investiture Controversy, Holy Roman Emperor Henry V installed anti-popes, but didn't try to become pope himself. Overall, it is true that the title of Tennō was occupied by a single dynasty, in the same sense that only one dynasty sat on the French throne between Hugh Capet and Louis XVI. However, actual control of Japan was held by several different dynasties. 

This is part of a general wave of adoption by protestant Germany in the same year. The calendar had been made more palpable to the Lutheran princes because this time it was a slightly modified form, as proposed by Erhard Weigel. 

(Click for large version. Source: University of Tsukuba.) This is obviously an incredibly crude map, though one may recognise a general resemblance to the Japanese archipelago. While the extant copies are from the 17th century, the is known to have been created as early as 1291. On this basis, educated Japanese elites may have known (very roughly) the shape of their homeland from at least the 1200s onward. A similar Gyōkizu style map of Japan is seen in a 1471 Korean publication, , which is thought to have been based on a 1453 map provided by a Hakata merchant.
