I don't know anything about Heidegger's student, Hans Jonas, so I cannot comment on that part of what you are asking, but I can do my best to explain the passage from Heidegger. I take the passage you reference to refer not to the origin of Dasein itself but to Dasein's thought before it has been corrupted by ontology. A mantra for understanding Heidegger is that we need to move from thinking about beings back to thinking about Being. For Heidegger, the study of beings -- the idea that we should look around and figure out what exists in the world and understand our place in it through this -- is a form of self-deception. He calls into "ontology." For him, we should instead do "metaphysics" which involves keeping our thoughts on Being. (looked at from the standpoint of analytic philosophy, this sounds like gibberish -- but it's not quite gibberish). What Heidegger wants to do is focus not on the nature of perception but on the nature of the consciousness that do so. For him, this will mean that we discover we are a consciousness that happens in space and time (with time being the most important part) and that ultimately will die. Keeping "Being" in mind means keeping in mind the way that consciousness generates being through its activities and ultimately that the deepest reality for this being (Dasein) is that it will die. The move to "ontology" makes it so that the self avoids this by thinking about objects and the world -- losing track of the sense in which all of this depends on its activity. 

This seems to just be a telescoping problem of frame. On a certain level, everything can be called "arbitrary" but then on a level of analysis where certain things are assumed, these same things are non-arbitrary. For instance, why do pawns move forward in chess? On the one hand, this is an arbitrary choice in the design of chess. But on the other hand, in the game of chess, this is a rule that is determinative for the sort of moves that pawns can make in chess. The same telescoping feature of how arbitrary works seems to be at the core of your question here. Your prompt is but then you follow this by looking at things in other scopes. On the level where moral imperatives and choices happen, an imperative is non-arbitrary if it can be shown to have a rational basis in that system. Working from Kant's theory, we can provide a rational basis for a rule against murder by supposing that the things murdered are rational creatures and that it's a rational end to keep these around. A further question is whether motivations are on the same level or a very different level. For Kant, moral motivation is special and is an objektiv Gef√ºhl called respect, but if we view moral motivations as just like any other motivations as physical drives, then it doesn't make much sense to call some non-arbitrary. On my view, Kant gets a lot of lifting out of that adjective "objective." But what makes it non-arbitrary on his view is that the basis for this feeling is nothing in the individual but only in reason alone. To generalize and move a bit away from Kant, views that are concerned with our moral choices being non-arbitrary often means that 

There's several Kantian texts to consider on this front and a key question about the nature of "interest." First, I want to look at "interest." Interest could mean something like or it could mean something like or just a mere I'm going to assume you don't mean but I want to mention it at various points during my answer, so I'll throw it in there too. Turning to Kant's texts, as many of the other answers note there's the Groundwork and the many formulations of the categorical imperative that can serve as a test. Two types of formulas seem important here: the universalization tests and the humanity/rationality tests. On most definitions of interest, it doesn't seem immediately contradictory for everyone to take an interest in these things. It seems troubling if we take interest as in but it's not even clear (at least at 10am) that this is by itself contradictory. On a certain level, there may be a practical contradiction (everyone does this plus the laws of nature) which I will mention below. Looking at the humanity/rationality tests, here we ask whether an action treats another as a means rather than an end, because rational nature ("humanity") always and everywhere deserves to be treated as an end and never merely as a mere means. On this formulation, it's clear some thing likes would be treating other's suffering as a means; other meanings are going to be a little fuzzier, like . and seem okay though in that while the suffering of others would be a means to this interest, the interest itself would be oriented towards people as ends. A second thing to consider in the Groundwork is the difference between perfect and imperfect duties. For Kant, we have a perfect duty to behave in accordance with the categorical imperative, but we also have two imperfect duties -- things where we don't universalize particular acts but do all need to pursue two ends: the perfection of ourselves and aiding others. An interest in tragedies of this sort could reflect an interest in perfecting ourselves and/or aiding others depending on how it works out. If it reflects neither, then it may be immoral for Kant. Moving away from the Groundwork, there are two other texts that are worth looking at. First, there's the Metaphysics of Morals especially its second half -- "Doctrine of Virtue" (= Tugendlehre) Here, Kant treats on a large number of practical questions and problem cases there. One case that springs to mind is Kant's response to animal suffering. Kant's view is that we should not enjoy animal suffering because it will numb us and make us indifferent to human suffering. It seems that by extension this would be an important issue to consider in response to interest in terrible events -- namely, that it's wrong if it numbs us to the wrong and horror of these events. A second text to consider is Kant's Anthropology. Here, the relevant point is that Kant splits anthropology from ethics proper and engages in a study of human behavior as it actually occurs. If your interest falls in a similar vein, it's hard to grasp how Kant could condemn it. 

addendum To clarify based on the OPs addition to their question, philosophical accounts that have absolute principles use these to create absolute prohibitions on certain actions. For instance, if you believe it is always wrong to use violence presumably you believe so because you think doing violence is qualitatively an absolute wrong that cannot be cancelled out by some other benefit (i.e. you cannot match quality with any quantity). To repeat, the justification is following Kant precisely that you take something to be of absolute worth and set this in contrast with things that have a price. Things of absolute worth are not subject to calculation. For instance if you take intelligent life to be of absolute value (qualitative claim), include dolphins in the definition of absolute value (empirical claim), then you conclude there's an absolute prohibition on killing dolphins. If you object, "but what if ..." and pose some hefty moral cost for this (every child on earth loses an eye, a kidney, and a leg), then one of two things will occur: 

The second could be a phenomenological question or merely a question about empirical psychology. I'm going ignore this second question. There are two very interesting discussions about the first question in philosophy. One discussion has to do with how selfhood works generically. Here, the question is related to the Ship of Theseus paradox. The ship of Theseus is a thought experiment in which a boat has its parts replaced one by one until no original part remains. The question is whether it is the same boat? If so, how? If not, why? The majority view on the boat is that it's still the same boat in part because what unifies the boat is a story from the boat as it was to the boat as it is now. Applied to the human case, the question gets even more complex because we are conscious and self-conscious entities. For conscious entities, there's (at least) a second sense of self at work that muddies this solution. As far as I'm aware, the views are kind of split between perdurance (the belief we are entities stretched in the physical dimensions + time = 4-dimensional time worm), endurance (the belief there is some unifying feature that makes my existence mine and enables me to last through time), and pseudo-Buddhism that denies there is a self (Derek Parfit -- bundle theory). I know at least a couple of the people on philosophy.se can tell you more if that's what you want.he The second version of the problem is a moral version called the Russian Nobleman offered by Derek Parfit and considered by among others Christine Korsgaard. The problem as I understand it is that a rich Russian nobleman as a youth is smitten by liberal ideas about society and wants to free his serfs -- but he simultaneously knows that when he gets old, he will regret this decision. So he makes a decision binding himself to free his serfs when he turns older. The question is who has bound whom and is the old man bound by this young man? Is it the same person or a different person? The issue here relates to your concern about punishment tomorrow for today's crimes. For those who deny that the self is the same, they don't want this to be something that happens instantly, so they have accounts of the self that are degreed. Meaning, the self tomorrow is pretty much 99% you. But the self 40 years from now may not be. 

The question seems to be worried in a somewhat inflammatory way, so I'm going to answer it in somewhat less inflammatory terms. Also, while it sounds like philosophy of religion because of the figures you picked, this is primarily just a matter of logic. Let's divide the question into different cases. Question 1: Would two people making opposite truth claims necessarily be a contradiction? The answer to this question is yes. If Person A and Person B take the positions P and not P regarding the exact same claim then at least one of them is wrong per the law of non-contradiction. (I will leave living outside the laws of non-contradiction as an exercise for the reader). So if A says that person C ate a banana for breakfast on July 12, 2014 and person B refers to the same Person C and says they did not eat a banana for breakfast on July 12, 2014 then at least one of them is wrong. 

My copy of the Concept of Anxiety is 7000 miles away, but I can answer more generall on this point. The basic idea is not original to Kierkegaard nor is his use of it singular to that particular text. Kierkegaard was especially fond of Diogenes the Cynic's response to one of Zeno's paradoxes.See here for more on the original case. For Kierkegaard, the application of this is a critique of the completeness of the system. Thus, the role in Concept of Anxiety and if memory serves Sickness unto Death is that sin lies outside of the moments that we can comprehend (a classic point that goes back at least to Augustine). The specific difference is that Kierkegaard applies this to a Hegelian notion of understanding that encompasses everything. His point is that human comprehension is like motion insofar as it happens only as certain states arrive and by necessity has gaps. (But I wonder if I'm adding anything you don't already know?) 

This sentence can have several different meanings, which may be creating a false sense of agreement between the positions of Berkeley and Kant. For Kant, the sentence: 

would mean that Q is necessary for Y. Because this would mean under any scenario where Y obtains, Q also obtains (by modus ponens). whereas 

Are we relativists about value or do we think there are at least some objective features? If we are relativists, are we to frame our evaluations in our own terms or in the terms of the culture we want to evaluate? When we say "sanity" do we mean a merely cultural notion of adaptation or do we mean to refer to our modern ideas about psychology or do we mean healthy relative to some ideal of flourishing? 

This is an interesting question, but I think it mostly boils down to two definition problems occurring in tandem. First, we need to be clear about use-mention: 

I am not much of a Berkeley scholar so my answer will primarily be an attempt to explain Kant with reference to the things you state in your question. I think we need to be very careful about what exactly we mean by 

Now, the reconstruction is not as strong as the initial construction you gave in that it (a) lacks the deductive form which can be truth-preserving and (b) it's openly probabilistic. ... But all of that to say, "fallacies" in natural language arguments and especially informal fallacies involve judgment calls about the validity of certain moves. 

One thing that be helpful to keep in mind is that the characters for yin and yang are (for some reason SE prohibits the characters here. See here). For readers of languages that use Chinese characters, one thing will be immediately evident -- the former character means "shadow" and the other "sunlight" (roughly speaking). The claim that in "Chinese philosophy" both are constituents of everything is based on the Yi Jing (formerly written as I Ching ) which is a book often associated with Daoism. There's some validity to the claim that this is true in Chinese philosophy more generally insofar as the neo-Confucians (approx. 11th and 12th Century) and the Chinese Buddhists tended to integrate this concept into their own accounts. One account of how the sun is also yin is that while the sun at its apex in the day is very yang, as it sets it becomes yin. (See here). My personal take is that you've got something that started as claim about light and shadow, and then became a metaphysical claim about all objects have aspects of both. Then, you need to go back and explain how that works, and this is going to be the hardest for the objects that created the conceptual duality in the first place. 

Hylomorphism is the view propounded by Aristotle where things are understood as being formed matter. This is implicit in the Greek words in the term hylomorphism with hyle being matter and morphe being form. In the case of living things, these forms are self-managing and arranging and are called "souls". For Aristotle, plants, animals, and humans all have souls but souls that differ in their functions. All of the souls engage in reproduction and growth but animals add to this sensation and humans reason. I am not quite sure what the phrase "Hylomorphism as the foundation of matter" would mean. But Aristotle did believe the only sorts of things we encounter are formed matter. Part of this is due to a difficult point in his metaphysics that plays on the pair potential and actual. Matter is fundamentally potential in that it can be shaped and organized. Form conversely is fundamentally active as it organizes and arranges something in a particular way. (A further complexity is the way artifacts (which for Aristotle means things people make) work insofar as the artifact's ideaa is not an intrinsic form, -- e.g., there's no essence he calls table). The key distinctive between this and Plato's view is that for Aristotle we observe forms using the essences and then abstract these from things. Similarly, the world we live in is not a world of shadow for Aristotle but the source of what we know. 

Several thoughts on this (1) It would help a lot if "relation" were defined more clearly. Do you mean "share similar ideas"? Do you mean that one learned from the other? Do you mean they organize the world similarly? (2) "Post-modernism" is a pretty nebulous term that refers to a lot of different things, so there's a little bit of something for everyone in it (and a lot of something where they would claim that can't be postmodernism). Let's take it for our purposes to be philosophies and outlooks that come in the wake of modernity and don't share its optimism for the prospects of modernity's project. (3) Given the two caveats about, I'd say what the two have most in common is that they can both serve as critiques of modernity. Or at least Taoism (and to some extent Buddhism) can be repurposed to that in philosophy. (4) It's wrong to call Taoism or Buddhism itself "post-modernism", because neither is a philosophical outlook that develops after "modernity." Instead, they are pre-modern in several senses. First, they precede modernity in Asia (and in the West). Second, they do not grow as a response to a thorough-going "scientific" approach to knowledge. (5) As I suggested above, both agree about being critiques of modernity. But just because different views agree that the "truth cannot be grasped intellectually", this does not mean that they agree that (a) the truth cannot be grasped and (b) that there's no truth to begin with. (6) Given this, one major point of departure in my view is that Buddhism while not believing that the truth can be grasped intellectually does believe that there are truths, which is not a view shared by the post-modernists. Stated another way, a good post-modernist would look just as askew at claims about a Buddha-nature in all of us or the prospect of enlightenment through the 8 fold path as they do at Kant's claims or traditional Christian claims. This is because they (let's say perhaps more carefully the post-structuralists and Rorty ) don't believe there's something beneath the web of meaning. To give an example, both post-structuralists and Buddhists think there's a problem with the rational self. Both think it should be eliminated or shown to be illusory. But for the Buddhist, there is something under that even if it is not to be grasped intellectually. We could on some level claim there's a type of truth in the universe for Buddhists. For the post-structuralist, beneath the idea of self, there are structures that are not themselves true nor do things get any better as we keep going down. (7) There's a different set of differences with Taoism. On my interpretation (which agrees with some of the more popular scholarship today), Taoist thought maintains that humans should live in harmony with nature rather than be caught up in either trying to grasp things intellectually or subdue nature to human will. This is expressed in the very name as the Taoist understanding of Tao. For most post-modernists, this Tao isn't going to be acceptable at the end of the day. It's still a fundamental construct that orders reality -- even if it's not something like the Confucian one or logical positivism. tl;dr - both critique modernity but they don't agree about everything.
