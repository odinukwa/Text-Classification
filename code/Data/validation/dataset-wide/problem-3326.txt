We don't know what all currently-existing languages are, and we know even less about all possible languages (I assume you mean human languages). We also do not have a list of all words in even one language, though for English you could get a pretty high percentage. Some languages have very rich and complex morphologies so a verb root could have zillions of inflected forms – some people only care about the lexical root, and not the full sayable word, hence you'd need to specify what you mean by "word". So I am afraid that you are out of luck. 

First thing I noticed were that his r's are American English, then his vowel reduction and intonation as Zgialor mentioned. 

There is a major difference between the natural language use (I do mean "use") of "or", "and" and the logical connectors that they traditionally translate. Whether "or" means "at least one" versus "exactly one" is a pragmatic matter, thus "Would you like pie or cake" at a dinner party is probably an offer of pie, cake, or both pie and cake. At a restaurant, the offer "For desert you can have pie or cake" probably means you have to pick one. Your description of the experiment isn't clear enough. If it is given that the hippo has a sad face and it ate a carrot, then the proffered rule for medal-assignment is not being followed. Therefore the frog's statement is somewhat immaterial – and perhaps that is the point of the experiment. But that problem aside, your first transformation is the problem. The sentence "The hippo didn't eat a carrot or a cucumber" means "The hippo didn't (eat (a carrot or a cucumber))", so negation has scope over the two disjuncts. 

Bear in mind that good data on frequency is non-existent (sampling problems plus coding problems, viz. whether "u" represents [u, ʊ, o] and even [ʉ]). With that caveat, the most frequent vowel is a and the most frequent consonant is t. Hairs can then be split over exactly what vowel is represented by "a", or how much aspiration "t" might have and still be called "t" rather than "tʰ" or "d". 

This is terminology from the theory of Lexical Phonology, which was popular at the time. In that theory, morphology and some parts of phonology are bundled together into a module called "Lexicon", which is responsible for creating words (stringing together morphemes and sorting out their pronunciation). Syntax happens later, and that is where words are assembled into utterances. After that, the phonology gets another pass at applying, where that last round of rule application is called "post-lexical phonology". Anything that applied between words was necessarily "post-lexical", because it was assumed that syntax come after the lexicon. 

Making no assumptions about Mandarin semantics, it is common in Bantu languages to have numerous tense inflections such as crastinal future, immediate future, immediate past, hesternal past, remote past and so on. These distinctions are encoded by selecting difference prefixes and suffixes on the verb. Usually, for any tense there are distinct affirmative vs. negative forms (negation involving some number of tense-determined special negative prefixes and often some special prefix forms regarding the marking of remote vs. immediate past). So in Bantu, negation is a package of morphemes (thought there are some languages which have a distinct and general negation word applicable to all tenses), and thus "I didn't see(remote) the child, although I did see(hesternal) the child" is not a contradiction. In Finnic and Saami (and I think also Mari) there are similar distinctions, in that there is a negative verb which bears all of the inflection, and the form of the negative verb is tense-determined. Hausa has something like that, where the negative particle (partially) indicate tense-aspect and subject person. I suspect that such distinctions are very common in languages where negation is part of inflectional morphology. 

A good and official source for IPA letters is here. From it you can learn exactly what each diacritic is called, e.g. ̥ is "voiceless". This also includes illustrative performances of most of the IPA letters, although there is a gap for the vowel-nudging diagritics. To go with that, I suggest Ladefoged & Maddieson The sounds of the world's languages, where you can look up particular terms in the index and see what they say about it. There is no unified resource which spells out the acoustics and articulation of each diacritic. In general, there is very little data out there which documents sound differences at the muscular level. IPA diacritics are particularly hard to define, because they refer to a modification of something more basic. The exact acoustics and articulation of palatalization depends on what sound you are comparing with, so it's different to some extent in [pʲ, tʲ, qʲ]. 

I would question the assumption that "in many countries around the world, especially in Africa, the people natively speak both an indigenous language and French due to French colonization". It is correct that French is an official language in a number of former colonies, but I believe the assumption that the populace of D.R. Congo, for example, natively speak French is untrue. First, there is a difference between natively speaking a language, and learning a language to a reasonable degree of fluency in school. Second, especially in Africa, there is a difference between the linguistic habits of the urban intelligentsia and the habits of the general population. French is widely used with the middle and upper class in francophone cities, but not so much with rural farmers. Also note that among educated city-dwellers in Africa (esp. Cameroon or Cote d'Ivoire), francophones often do not natively speak some indigenous language, instead, they just speak French (and maybe know enough Bamileke to talk to grandma). Whether or not French ultimately expands or contracts in the former colonies depends largely on the extent to which formal education expands to transplant the urban experience into rural areas. An obvious difference between England and the former French colonies is the amount of time between the departure of the French (finessing a few assumptions about "French" and "departing"), which alone could account for any actual difference in the status of French in these cases. A less obvious difference is the vastly different statuses of formal education (not important in Medieval England, quite important in modern Africa). 

There is no applicable metric, so the question has no answer. To measure similarity, you could try to enumerate the differences between two (very similar) languages, and keep a tab of the points of difference. For instance, Swedish and Norwegian are very similar, but where Swedish has many plural endings -ar, -or, -er, Norwegian only has -er. But if that one difference or two -- is the difference "Norwegian only has -er", or "Norwegian doesn't have -or" and "Norwegian doesn't have -ar"? Then, what would a comparison of Swedish and Finnish reveal? One approach to plurals in Finnish is that there is a non-nominative plural suffix -i- and a general plural -t-. Swedish doesn't have a special case-determined plural suffix, so that's one. Finnish -t- is not the same as Swedish -or, -ar -er, but it is not totally unlike -- both have a lingual (coronal) consonant. So you would have to award fractional points for partial similarity. Except, the Finnish plural -t- is actually not realized as [t] most of the time -- you have to do a fair amount of phonological analysis to get to this conclusion about the plural. So should similarity be based on abstract underlying forms, or on the specific phonetic form in given words? There is no scale for quantifying non-identity, so the question can't be answered. Using "mutually unintelligibility" yields the simple conclusion that English is as dissimilar to Greek as it is to Chinese, in other words, most languages are completely "dissimilar". Well, this just in... this has a striking similarity to Norwegian, but is completely not intelligible with Norwegian.
