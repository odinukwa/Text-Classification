This is a problem that has also an inequality constraint, alongside the budget constraint that is here given as an equality. For simplicity, substitute the equality constraint into the utility function and form a Lagrangian $$\Lambda = u(x_1,x_2(x_1)) + \lambda(T-x_1),\;\; \lambda \geq 0$$ where $\lambda$ is a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker multiplier. Then maximize with respect to $x_1$. 

A) If we care about not making losses, one can observe that a) $Q(K=0, L>0) >0$ (i.e. we can obtain positive output without capital) and b) Output is linear in $K$ and $MP_K = 2$, while $r=9$. So for each unit of capital we will employ, we will obtain $2$ additional units of output, but we will have to pay $9$ units of output as capital reward: employing capital means subsidizing it here, given its price. So we should not employ capital at all, since in light of a), we can have positive output without it. On the other hand if, say, $L=1$ then $Q = 20$ while $wL = 5$. So there is room for production to be carried using only labor, without subsidizing the production factor. So we have $K^* = 0$. But then, $$C^* = wL^*,\;\; L^* = \frac {\bar Q^2}{400}$$ The cost function now has a non-interesting minimum at zero, and then it monotonically increases. In order not to make losses, we need $$ \bar Q - C^* \geq 0 \implies \bar Q - w\frac {\bar Q^2}{400} \geq 0 \implies \left(1-w\frac {\bar Q^*}{400}\right) \geq 0 $$ $$ \bar Q \leq \frac {400}{w}$$ So, if we care about not making losses, a) We do not employ capital and b) output level should not exceed, for $w=5$, $Q \leq 80$. B) If we don't care about making losses (say, this is a public utility that has to deliver a specific level of output irrespective of whether it will cost more than the revenue obtained from selling the output) Let's see where the standard approach leads us. $$\min_{K,L} C = rK + wL \;\;\;s.t.\;\; g(K,L) = 2K + 20L^{1/2} = \bar Q$$ for any given level of output. The Lagrangean is $$ \Lambda = rK + wL + \lambda[\bar Q-2K - 20L^{1/2}]$$ and if we calculate the first-order conditions for a minimum we get $$\partial \Lambda/\partial K = 0 \implies r - 2\lambda =0 \implies \lambda = r/2 \tag{1}$$ $$\partial \Lambda/\partial L = 0 \implies w - \lambda\cdot 10L^{-1/2} = 0 \tag {2}$$ which for $r=9, w=5$ leads to a candidate solution $\{K^*,L^*=81,\lambda^* = 4.5\}$ To determine what happens at the candidate solution we need to consider also second-order conditions for a minimum $$\partial^2 \Lambda/\partial L^2 = 5\lambda L^{-3/2} $$ $$\partial^2 \Lambda/\partial K^2 = \partial^2 \Lambda/\partial L\partial K =0$$ Then the bordered Hessian matrix (=matrix of second derivatives of the Lagrangean bordered by the first derivatives of the constraint, and a zero in the upper left position) is $$\bar H = \left [ \begin{matrix} 0 & 2 & 10L^{-1/2} \\ 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 10L^{-1/2} & 0 & 5\lambda L^{-3/2} \\ \end{matrix} \right]$$ For the candidate solution to be a minimum, we need the bordered principal minors (minor determinants) to all be strictly negative except for the first which is by construction zero), at least evaluated at the candidate solution. We have $$|\bar H_2| = \left | \begin{matrix} 0 & 2 \\ 2 & 0 \\ \end{matrix} \right| = -4 <0$$ and $$|\bar H_3| = \left | \begin{matrix} 0 & 2 & 10L^{-1/2} \\ 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 10L^{-1/2} & 0 & 5\lambda L^{-3/2} \\ \end{matrix} \right| = 0 - 2\cdot10\lambda\cdot L^{-3/2} + 0 <0 $$ for $\lambda , L$ strictly positive. So we 're good... except we do not know the value for $K^*$. Are we free to choose any level of capital we want? Certainly not. Remember that the multiplier $\lambda ^*$ is optimal Marginal Cost (as a function of output). But here, assuming non-zero Capital is employed, optimal marginal cost does not depend on the level of output, it is fixed at $\lambda ^* =4.5$, due to the linear appearance of $K$ in the production function, and the assumed price-taking behavior of the organization. In other words: if we employ capital, we should have fixed $MC(Q) = 4.5$. This means that as long as we can carry production with lower marginal cost than that, we should not employ capital. But if there is a level of output produced solely by labor, at and after which, to continue producing using only labor would result in marginal cost higher than $4.5$, then, it becomes optimal to start employ capital (optimal strictly in the sense of cost-minimization). Under production solely using labor we have $$C = \frac {w\bar Q^2}{400} \implies MC = \frac {\bar Q}{40}$$ So for $MC \leq 4.5 \implies \bar Q \leq 180$ After $\bar Q =180$ if we employ additional labor to increase production our marginal cost will be higher than if we start employing capital. And this will continue, because the marginal product of labor will be falling, while the marginal product of capital is constant. So we conclude that up to $\bar Q =180$ we should carry production using only labor, and after that, we should stop employing any additional labor, and cover all resource needs by employing capital, the level of which will evidently be determined as given in @BKay 's answer. The full mathematical treatment would require turning this into a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker framework, and include multipliers for the case of decision variables taking the value zero. 

This does not mean that historically governments have not used increases in the money supply to hand out transfers to the poorer segments of the population. They have, but it wasn't implemented in such a "grand redistribution scheme" style, and it wasn't so widespread that it would seriously affect the purchasing power of the rest. 

Due to Jensen's inequality, we have $$E(\ln y) \leq \ln E(y) \implies \exp\{E(\ln y)\} \leq E(y)$$ So if one uses $\exp\{E(\ln y)\}$ to construct a confidence interval for $E(y)$, it will be shifted to the left, and it will be of smaller length than it should. Applying a 2nd-order Taylor expansion of $E(\ln y)$ around $E(y)$ we have $$E(\ln y) \approx E\left[ \ln E(y) + \frac{y-E(y)}{E(y)}-\frac 12 \frac {[y-E(y)]^2}{[E(y)]^2}\right]$$ $$\implies E(\ln y) \approx \ln E(y) -\frac 12 \frac {\sigma_y^2}{\mu_y^2} $$ $$\implies \ln E(y) \approx E(\ln y) +\frac 12 \frac {\sigma_y^2}{\mu_y^2} $$ the correction being one half the squared coefficient of variation. One can then estimate the correction term by obtaining say Method of Moments estimators (sample moments) for the variance and the mean of $y$. 

Mankiw's definition alludes to a situation where the only source of unemployment is frictions and imperfections in the labor/human capital market (you could also add inherent rigidities like "specificity" of labor/human capital, which is the price to pay for specialization). But also, in "imperfections" Mankiw may also include "wage rigidities". We could say that this is the "micro" approach, focused on the special characteristics of the labor/human capital market. Blanchard's 1st definition on the other hand is more "macroeconomic": it is a perfect-foresight equilibrium state (or maybe a self-fulfilled one). It indirectly says that, whenever (i.e. always) expectations and forecasts on the nominal magnitudes are not perfect, the real magnitudes of the economy do not come out exactly as expected, creating variations in, among other things, the unemployment rate. But when we have such an ideal state of perfect foresight, even temporarily, the unemployment observed will be the "natural rate". Blanchard does not go into why this "natural rate" is not zero (presumably, he has in mind the "micro-" approach as an explanation). So we could say that Mankiw describes the "natural rate" as the rate due to causes over and beyond expectational disequilibrium on nominal magnitudes. On the other hand, Blanchard identifies the natural rate as -...exactly, the rate that will prevail in the absence of expectational disequilibrium on nominal magnitudes (he just doesn't state what other causes create unemployment). Blanchard second definition is the NAIRU concept clearly explained in @BKay's answer.
