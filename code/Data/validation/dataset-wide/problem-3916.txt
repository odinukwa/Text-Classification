Yes. The character table of SL(2,q) is known. If q is odd, the sum of the dimensions of the irreducible representations of SL(2,q) is q2+q. If q is even, this sum is q2. In either case, this is bigger than the dimension of $\mathbb{C}\{X\}$, so there must exist irreps not in $\mathbb{C}\{X\}$. 

I answer the first question only. The space $\mathcal{V}_\lambda$ is highest weight for the affine Lie algebra, hence a quotient of a Verma $\Delta(\mu)$ of the affine Lie algebra. The maximal submodule $\mathcal{Z}_\lambda$ is thus the image of the maximal submodule of the Verma. The maximal submodule of a Verma is known to be generated by the vectors $f_i^{\langle \mu,\alpha_i^\vee\rangle+1}v_\mu$ as $\alpha_i$ runs over the simple roots for the affine root system. In your case, the vectors in this set corresponding to finite simple roots all map to zero in the quotient $\mathcal{V}_\lambda$ by its construcion from a finite dimensional irreducible. Therefore the maximal submodule of $\mathcal{V}_\lambda$ is generated by the image of the vector for the affine root, which is the generator you have written down. 

The answer is yes. We know G is reductive, take B=TU a Borel. Decompose V into a direct sum of weight spaces for T: $V=\oplus V_\lambda$. I claim that C contains a non-zero wieght vector. Proof: First lets consider T=Gm. If v=Σivi in C with t in Gm acting on vi by multiplication by ti, consider $\lim_{t\to \infty}t^{-N}(t\cdot v)$ (t-N is scalar multiplication, dot is action). Since C is closed under action, scalar multiplication and taking limits, this is a weight vector in C for appropriate N. (this argument produces a weight vector of maximal possible weight in span(Gmv).) A general T is a product of Gm's. We pick a vector in C, run the argument for each factor Gm in succession, and end up with a weight vector for T. If v in Vλ and u in U, then uv-v is in $\oplus V_\mu$ where only wieghts μ greater than λ appear in the sum. Let v be a weight vector in C of maximal possible weight . Applying u to v and running the torus argument again, we see that for this maximalilty assumption to hold, v must be annihilated by all of U. Since stabaliser of v is reductive, containing U, it must contain derived group of G. Let $\alpha^\vee$ be a simple coroot and λ be a weight appearing in V. Suppose $\langle\alpha^\vee,\lambda\rangle$>0. Since C spans V, there exists c in C with non-zero projection onto Vλ. Run the Gm argument with the vector c and the subgroup $\alpha^\vee(\mathbb{G}_m)$. Now run the torus argument on this output, we get a weight vector in C of weight μ where $\langle\alpha^\vee,\mu\rangle>0$. Now under this assumption, the paragraph with the unipotent element shows that there is a weight vector v in V, of weight ν greater than μ with derived group in stabaliser. Also $\langle\alpha^\vee,\nu\rangle>0$. This is a contradiction. Simlilaraly $\langle\alpha^\vee,\lambda\rangle$<0 is a contradiction. So for every weight λ and every simple coroot $\alpha^\vee$, we have $\langle\alpha^\vee,\lambda\rangle$=0, which forces the representation to be a direct sum of characters. 

For g in G, write g=gsgu as its Jordan decomposition into semisimple and unipotent parts. I claim that the closure of the conjugacy class of g contains an elliptic element if and only if gs is elliptic. Let us first suppose that gs is not elliptic. Choose an embedding of G into GLn(ℂ). Then by our assumption, gs has an eigenvalue of norm greater than one, let λ be the absolute value of such an eigenvalue. Suppose for want of contradiction that the conjugacy class of gs contained an elliptic element a in its closure. WLOG a is in the special unitary group SUn. Let h be in the conjugacy class of gs. Then h has an eigenvalue of absolute value λ. Letting v be an eigenvector, we see that |(h-a)v| is at least (λ-1)|v|, so |h-a|≥λ-1, a contradiction. Now suppose that gs is elliptic. We may replace G by the centraliser of gs is G, which is also reductive. So WLOG, gs is central in G. Now the Zariski closure of the group generated by gu is a one-dimensional unipotent subgroup of G. Let E be a non-zero element in its lie algebra. This is a nilpotent element. Then by the Jacobson-Morozov theorem, we can extend E to a sl2 triple E,F,H in Lie(G). Now consider conjugation by elements of the form exp(tH) with t real. This shows that gs is in the closure of the conjugacy class of g, and we're done. 

This answer is merely in relation to the naive dimension count calculated in the question. When taking a GIT quotient, one cannot merely subtract the dimensions to get the dimension of the quotient. For example if you quotient gln by GLn with the adjoint action, then the GIT quotient is n-dimensional. (the quotient here is actually affine n-space and the map sends a matrix to its characteristic polynomial). 

[This is an embellished version of the answer I gave in the comment section] The key to the solution lies in recalling that when one is playing with Lie groups, the functions that one encounters are not mere $C^\infty$ functions but are actually real-analytic. There is some discussion of this in the second edition of Knapp's book "Lie Groups Beyond an Introduction". Now for $g\in G$, let $P_g(t)$ denote the charcteristic function of $\operatorname{Ad}(g)$. Then the function $g\mapsto P_g(-1)$ is an analtyic function on $G$. Since this function is nonzero at the identity, it is nonzero on a dense subset of the identity component of $G$. (so we have an affirmative answer for connected $G$.) As is currenly noted in both the question and in the comments, for disconnected $G$, the example of the even orthogonal group limits what we can say away from the identity component. I guess the case of $\pi_0(G)$ odd is still unresolved. Aber das ist eine andere Geschichte und soll ein andermal erzählt werden. 

Let G be a reductive group over a local field F. Let O be the ring of integers of F. The following are equivalent (and groups satisfying these conditions are called unramified): (a) G is quasisplit and split after passing to an unramified extension of F. (b) G is the generic fibre of a reductive group scheme over O. This is stated, as far as I can tell without a proof or reference to one, in Tits' Corvallis article. My question is - how does one prove this equivalence? 

If you have a strict ind-scheme (inductive limit of schemes with maps closed imersions), for example affine flag varieties as a limit of schubert cells, then you can ask that all these varieties are compatably Frobenius split, so the notion of a Frobenius splitting makes sense. Then you can ask if the affine flag variety admits a Frobenius splitting. The asnwer is yes. I learnt this under mild conditions from a course of Xinwen Zhu, from which the original reference appears to be Faltings' paper "Algebraic loop groups and moduli spaces of bundles". Here the affine flag variety is defined in a particular way, and of course if you want to define it in a different way (eg using Kac-Moody) groups, then you must do some work to show that definitions agree. This result is harder than in finite type since you don't have the smooth Schubert cell associated to the long word as a crutch to get you started. 

I think that Shrawan Kumar's book "Kac-Moody groups, their flag varieties, and representation theory" will contain the flag varieties (which are really ind-varieties in the non-finite case) that you are looking for. A crystallographic Coxeter group is one of the form $\langle s_1,\ldots,s_n| s_i^2=(s_i s_j)^{m_{ij}}=1\rangle$ where each mij is equal to 2,3,4,6 or infinity. Such Coxeter groups are precisely the Weyl groups associated to arbitrary Kac-Moody algebras. In this case, there is a corresponding Kac-Moody group, together with an associated flag variety and Schubert cells, which seems to me to be what you want. It is this geometry that is the starting point of the geometric interpretation of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials in the crystallographic case. As is to be expected, the finite case is easier than the affine case, which again is easier than the arbitrary KM case. 

A counterexample is given by the Taft Hopf algebra. (I checked this at least for n=2, where this Hopf algebra also goes by a different name that I forget today). 

Here is another notion of a reduced decomposition for the long word, as used for example in a recent preprint of Baumann, Kamnitzer and Tingley. Recall the theorem from the finite type case that reduced decompositions of w0 are in bijection with convex orderings on the set of positive roots. The latter notion is easier to generalise, and can be considered an appropriate analogue. Definition: A convex order on the set of all positive roots Φ+ is a preorder ≤ such that i) For all α, β in Φ+, we have α ≤ β or β ≤ α (OR not XOR). ii) If α ≤ β and α+β is a root, then α ≤ β+α ≤ β. iii) If α ≤ β and β ≤ α then α and β are proportional. Voila. 

Let G be a k-analytic group, and let H be a closed subgroup of G. Then does there exist a k-analytic space, which can be reasonably called the quotient G/H? Commentary: I realise that I am not being overly precise here. This is partly because I am not sure in exactly what form I want to ask this question. In lieu of this, I will mention an example, that I suspect may produce an interesting quotient space. Let Spec(A) be an affine group scheme of finite type over ko. Let G be the analytification of the generic fibre of Spec(A). On $A\otimes_{k^\circ} k$, one can define the seminorm where ||a|| is defined to be the infimum of all |t| where $t\in k^\times$ is such that $a\in tA=t(A\otimes_{k^\circ} 1)\subset A\otimes_{k^\circ} k$. Take the completion of this tensor product with respect to this seminorm, and let H be its spectrum (which is then naturally an affinoid subgroup of G). 

If G is a reductive algebraic group (say over ℂ), T a maximal torus, then we can consider its Weyl group W which acts on the abelian group Y of one parameter subgroups of T. Thus we may form the semidirect product, which I will call the affine Weyl group. In the semisimple simply connected case, this affine Weyl group is a Coxeter group. In the general setup I have here, the affine Weyl group is no longer a Coxeter group, but shares some properties of Coxeter groups. For example one can still define a length function, and considering an Iwahori subgroup of a loop group, we get something that looks like it wants to be a BN-pair/Tits system (but isn't, since we don't have a Coxeter group). Since the axiomatic setup of Coxeter groups and BN-pairs is so convenient, I ask if there has been developed a generalisation of this setup to include the affine Weyl groups I mention above. I have some vague feeling that this should include some sort of 'disconnected' (I am thinking in the algebraic group sense when I use this word) Coxeter group, where the connected component is a genuine Coxeter group. 

I claim the following is true: Theorem: Let G be an isotropic (definition: contains a subgroup isomorphic to m) semisimple algebraic group over the nonarchimedean local field k. Suppose that the characteristic of k does not divide the order of the fundamental group of G. Then the commutator subgroup [G(k),G(k)] is open (and of finite index). This essentially boils down to the affirmative answer to the Kneser-Tits conjecture for local fields, which I think is due to Prasad and Raghunathan in all characteristics. This is the part where the hard work takes place. I have no idea how to proceed if G is anisotropic. First consider the case when G is simply connected when I claim furthermore that G(k) is perfect. The Kneser-Tits problem asks if G(k) is generated by the (k-points of the) unipotent radicals of parabolic subgroups. So it suffices to show that root subgroups lie in the commutator subgroup. So let S be a maximal split torus, a an indivisible root and Ua the corresponding root subgroup. Most of the time Ua is a vector group and it is easy to show Ua(k)&subseteq;[G(k),G(k)] by computing the commutator of an element of S(k) and an element of Ua(k). In the remaining cases 2a is also a root, but Ua has a canonical two-step filtration with subquotients vector groups and we can proceed in much the same manner. (reference for the relevant structure theory: Section 3.3 in Pseudo-reductive Groups) This deals with the simply-connected case. For the general case it suffices to show that H1(k,π1(G)) is finite. After passing to a finite Galois extension of k, the group scheme π1(G) becomes isomorphic to a product of μn's. So a spectral sequence argument reduces the finiteness to the finiteness of H^1(k,μn)=k*/(k*)n.
