Nirvana is not 'caused'. This is why the Buddha referred to the "path" to Nirvana rather than the "cause" of Nirvana. Imagine being blind-folded. The eyes cannot see any sights. But if the blind-fold is removed, sights can be seen. Similarly, greed, hatred & delusion are like a blind-fold that prevent experiencing Nibbana. Nibbana is not something 'mental' although the mind experiences Nibbana (as a sense object). This is similar to how a tree or flower is not the eye, but the eye experiences the tree or flower. 

Correct. These matters are discussed in suttas such as DN 1 & AN 3.61. Dhp279 & SN 20.7 state all things whatsoever are not self & the whole universe is void of self. 

Nibbana is the 5 skandas have overcome the idea of a "person" & "who". The Pali scriptures define Nibbana as the end of greed, hatred & delusion and occurring to a living conscious mind. The following is merely one teaching from many: 

To conclude, the ideal of attaining liberation & enlightenment cannot be equated with the aspiration to end life. As for the ideal of all beings attaining liberation (which would probably end human life but not all life), this is only found in Mahayana Buddhism and did not exist in the original Pali Buddhism, as shown in the Uttiya Sutta. From the very beginning, the Buddha never believed all beings could reach enlightenment. 

The Buddha did not speak in English. 'Saṃsāro' does not mean 'transmigration'. Samsaro is explained in SN 22.99: 

For example, the very moment the mind gets angry, it is spontaneously born as a 'hell-being'. 'This world' ('loka') refers to the human world of good morals & conscience. The 'other worlds' ('paraloka') refer to the heavenly (bliss), hell (torment), animal (immoral, emotionally reactive & unreflective) and ghost (addiction) worlds. For example, MN 79 refers to the 'world of only pleasant feelings': 

If Buddhism is regarded as 'psychology' rather than as 'religion', there will be no competition/conflict between the two. Of course, if this attitude is adopted, generally the 'belief' aspects of cultural Buddhism (such as Buddha statues, reincarnation, etc) must ideally be dropped. If the ancient Greeks did not introduce alien Buddha statues into Buddhism & if the ambitious Buddhist rulers & clergy did not taint their scriptures with Brahmanistic ideas (for the purpose of religious conversion), Buddhism may have lasted longer in central Asia due to not being falsely regarded as a form of idolatry. 

The Buddha taught the Dhamma is a free gift. Assuming you live in India, if the Root Institute is too expensive for you, you could possibly consider travelling to Sri Lanka, where you can probably stay & learn in a Buddhist monastery for no financial cost. Also, FPMT teaches Tibetan Buddhism, often focusing on more modern teachers they consider to be important, such as Atisa, Manjushri, Shantideva & Pabongkhapa ; and also focusing on deity yoga, such as Tara. While my personal experience with FPMT is they are very nice people, the teachings are very Tibetan and often very different to classical Theravada Buddhism. 

When the path is actually entered, this is stream-entry. It is essentially a path of happiness since there is very little suffering, even at this entry level (SN 13.1). The word 'vossagga' (relinquishment; letting go) is similar to (yet less mature than) the word 'paṭinissagga', which is included as a quality of Nibbana as defined in the 3rd noble truth. In the meditation teachings, it is said the beginning path levels of meditation have the quality of 'vossagga'. Therefore, while the Buddha did not speak the quote in the OP, he did teach similar to it. 

The Buddha did work it out for himself; which is why he is so esteemed because working it out for yourself is very difficult, close to impossible, which is why it took the Buddha six years to work it out. But you seem to have overlooked the fact that the Buddha did not actually know what he was trying to work out; apart from looking for real peace. He was searching or groping in the dark. 

Only the suffering of attachment is real dukkha. The suffering of attachment is the only dukkha a Buddha can overcome. Therefore, when the Buddha had the deadly illness with painful feelings, this was not suffering. There is the phrase: "Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional". Many many suttas explain this, such as MN 37, the end of MN 38, SN 22.1, AN 8.6 & SN 36.6. 

To become independent, the Buddhist scriptures (SN 56.120) explain an 'animal' mind must realise the Four Noble Truths & practise the Noble Eightfold Path to become 'human'. The full development of moral empathy is explained in the Veludvareyya Sutta, as follows: 

In Hinduism, the 'soul' ('Atman') is something permanent that reincarnates from life to life (as described in the Bhagavad Gita, for example). At least in the Christian Gospels attributed to Jesus, the 'soul' appears to be described as something more like the human mind/'heart'/conscience that can be saved/set free or, otherwise corrupted/defiled (by karma); what in Buddhism is called the 'citta'. (However, the same as in Buddhism, over historical time, the soul has been taken in Christianity to be something that exists after the passing of the physical body). In Buddhism, the 'soul' or 'citta' is something 'immaterial'. Therefore, it cannot be said what it is 'made of'. All that can be known is the 'soul' knows, feels, perceives, thinks & creates emotions that can torment itself into suffering or, otherwise, can be set free/purified from suffering. The Buddhist scriptures define 'mind'/'soul' as being made up of 'feeling', 'perception', 'intention', 'contact' & 'attention'; plus other mental faculties such as 'mindfulness', 'decision', 'energy', 'zeal', etc. But what 'mind'/'citta'/'soul' is 'made of' cannot be defined because it is 'immaterial' ('arupa'). 

Due to DN 31 teaching the duty of a monk is to teach lay people the path to heaven (worldly happiness) rather than the path to Nibbana, there are two sequences in Buddhism. 

The word 'porāṇaka' appears to be not found in any teachings attributed to the Buddha; however appears found in later-day commentaries & Jataka Tales; as shown in this search list. 

As for 'mother & father', this teaching is not about physical birth but about recognising you have benefactors. In other words, the right view of 'there is mother & father' creates gratitude & the right view that reciprocal or obligatory actions (kamma) must be performed in return towards mother & father and towards any other benefactors, such as teacher, student, employer, employee, etc. 

Although it might get scary initially, there is a 3rd option, namely, sit there and experience what it feels like not to be lonely. In Buddhism, this is called 'solitude', 'seclusion' or 'aloneness' ('viveka'). While not explicitly Buddhist, Chapter 23 of the following link distinguishes between 'loneliness' & 'aloneness': Think on these Things by J.Krishnamurti 

Mindfulness does not mean "to see" or "to observe". "Mindfulness" means "to remember" or "keep in mind". 

The third ring appears to be stating: (a) the five aggregates are 'passive' or 'neutral' (per the Khandha Sutta, which describes neutral/mere/pure aggregates versus defiled aggregates subjected to clinging) & (b) it is the activity of ignorance, sankhara, craving, attachment & becoming that actively keep the 'wheel of life' spinning. This two-fold distinction of the illustrator is based on the premise that 'birth' & 'aging-&-death' refer to physical birth & aging-&-death (rather than psychological 'birth' & 'aging-&-death'). It is also based on the premise than 'sankhara' refers to 'volitional formations' (rather than the kaya, vaci & citta sankhara as described in MN 44). It also appears to infer the 3rd to 7th links are not 'activated' or 'disturbed' by ignorance. 

Christianity & Buddhism are essentially the same in respect to 1. morality & 2. unified non-judgmental love however different in relation to 3. wisdom. In fact, it is highly probable the Christian teachings that set Christianity apart from Judaism come from Buddhism & post-Buddhist-Brahmanism (Hinduism). 'Brahma' is the 'Father of All' and the Buddha (in the Tevijja Sutta) taught to non-Buddhist Brahmans that the way or path to Brahma was to radiate limitless unconditional love in all directions, which is essentially the same as what Jesus taught, namely: "My love is the Way to the Father" (John 14.6) & "God is love" (1 John 4:8). Buddhism differs from Christianity in that is does not believe in a creator God and believes everything in life, whether physical, mental or Nirvana, is merely natural elements ('dhatu'). Buddhism is strictly impersonal ('anatta') where as Christianity believes in personality, including the personality of God. The following book makes a comparison however I doubt it is completely objective since it seeks to make mutual understanding between religions: Christianity & Buddhism - Buddhadasa Indapanno 

The basics of Buddhism is the Triple Refuge. The 2nd Refuge is refuge in the Dhamma or the Teachings, which is officially & completely defined as follows: 

The breath does not stop. What happens is the breath stops being an object of awareness because the breath calms but the mind remains too coarse or gross to be aware of the breath. Here, the mind must let go more & be more quiet, until the mind can feel the breath again. Trying to focus will not help because it is the very act of trying (to focus) that makes the mind too coarse or gross to know the breathing. The supramundane path of the Buddha is only about letting go. The Buddha taught supramundane meditation (jhana) is developed by making letting go (vossagga) the meditation object (SN 48.10; end of MN 118). 

Correct. A lie is unwholesome because of our unwholesome intentions. For example, if a monk hides an innocent person from a would-be-murderer and the murderer asks the monk has the monk seen the innocent person, it is not unwholesome if the monk lies to the murderer. Why should a monk be honest to a murderer if the murderer will murderer as a result of the monk's honesty? 

However, a sutta named the Cula-Kammavibhanga Sutta claims evil-doers can be 'reborn' in the human state, as follows: 

Thanissaro has done many wrong translations and given many wrong teachings however his PDF internet book called 'Shape of Suffering' is true & real. Buddhism teaches its followers to question every doctrine (AN 3.65; MN 95; MN 38; etc). 

'Existence' ('bhava') is a mental 'view' ('ditthi'). When the mind is free from 'self-view', 'existence' will cease. Instead, there will only be mental & physical 'elements' (dhatu) rather than 'existence'. 

In the Pali suttas, uppādo is most prominently used in "paticcasamuppada", namely, "dependent co-arising". An examination of the above three Pali words shows they refer primarily to mental production, mental manifestation & mental arising. "Abhinibbatti" in particular refers to the production of ideas about "self" or "individuality" ("attabhava"). . It follows the meaning of SN 26.9 is the continued manifestation, production and arising of views of "self" based on the six elements is the mental manifestation of (ideas) of aging & death that result in suffering. Most importantly, SN 26.9 show the "physical" interpretation of "birth" ("jati") in the Dependent Origination is wrong (since these Pali words abhinibbatti and pātubhāvo are found in the definition of "jati"). 

'Cessation' is part of both the beginning & end of the noble path. For example, the Anapanasati Sutta states the mindfulness that leads in insight ('investigation-of-dhammas') is supported by 'cessation' and also has the final result of (final) 'cessation' (of suffering). To quote: 

The Anapanasati Sutta in Pali is here: $URL$ It appears there is no Pali script, per the comment made to the question: 

It is useful for thinking: "I can enter the path" but it is useless for actually entering the noble path because entering the noble path is based on abandoning the conceit "I am". The four Best Kinds of Faith do not include the conceit "I can". 

The common denominator is the feeling of pleasure. Apart from that, the conditions giving rise to the two types of pleasure are different. The conditions giving rise to the pleasure of the household life is craving & affection where as the conditions giving rise to the pleasure of the recluse life is the abandoning of craving & affection. 

Samadhi (lucid unified consciousness) occurs when the mind stops thinking & lets go, which can occur in formal meditation, spontaneously or when people take drugs. That is what it is & that is what it came from. In Buddhism, what is next is always the Noble Eightfold Path, which is based in abandoning craving, attachment & manufacturing egoism towards every experience without exception. What is next is Nibbana or Peace. What is not next is believing: "I am God", "I am World Saviour", "I am Awakened", etc. In Buddhism, what is next is not "I am". "I am" is a belief found in Judaism, Christianity & Hinduism but not Buddhism. Buddhism teaches "anatta", which means "not self". The Buddha taught: 

To find or identify noble people can be difficult, even impossible, because you yourself must have some idea about the True Dhamma to be able to do this. Therefore, a problem arises similar to the question of: "What occurs 1st, the chicken or the egg?" The Canki Sutta provides the following preliminary answer to the question: 

It is true that worldly love finally ends up with sufferings; that worldly forms of love is a root to suffering. The only people without suffering are enlightened people. It may appear in the society there are plenty of people who lead very happy and non-suffering lives with love but this appearance is not true. If the people with full of honesty mostly get cheated and suffer their lives, how can such sinlessness (honesty) be the result of previous sins & merits? Such an idea is illogical. People with full of honesty get cheated because of acts of evil people. If I am a good person & an evil person wants to murder me, how can I stop this? I cannot. 

Not all Pali suttas are the words of the Buddha, which is why there are contradictions. In the Maha-parinibbana Sutta, this is addressed by the Four Great References. The Karajakā­ya­ Sutta can appear a contradiction due to the Pali language, which often can be interpreted in two ways: (1) in mundane (lokiya) language, which will result in contradiction; and (2) in supramundane (lokuttara) language, which will not result in contradiction. In mundane language, it seems the Karajakā­ya­ Sutta would make enlightenment impossible in a lifetime because the doer of bad kamma would keep being reborn in (an external) hell for each past unwholesome action. However, in supramundane language, the results of kamma are experienced in the mind, such as the Buddha explained: "I recollected my manifold past dwellings, i.e., one birth, two... five, ten... fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand...There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure & pain..." This said, the context of the Karajakā­ya­ Sutta is important. The section in the Anguttara Nikaya it is in are mundane (lokiya) teachings of morality rather than supramundane (lokuttara) teachings for enlightenment. For example, AN 10.217, which has the same teachings, is about the ten kinds of bad kamma that laypeople do. Therefore, the Karajakā­ya­ Sutta appears to not be for enlightenment. It is mundane (lokiya) morality dhamma for laypeople or householders. If we do not understand the principle of 'two kinds of right view' found in MN 117 and in the commentary quote below, suttas such as the Karajakā­ya­ Sutta may appear in contradiction. For example, on a supramundane level, when Angulimala was in the stream to Nibbana (for arahantship), his mind would have been free from 'self-view' therefore free from suffering. However, this mind would have probably experienced the results of past kamma in the form of painful feelings & residual defilements (per SN 36.6). When we are non-returners practising for arahantship, we might fully understand the Karajakā­ya­ Sutta (rather than theorize & speculate, as I have done). 

svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo: perfectly spoken is the Dhamma of the Blessed One sandiṭṭhiko: visible in the here-&-now akāliko: immediately effective; without delay; 'timeless' ehipassiko: inviting inspection opaneyyiko: leading onwards (to experiencing here-&-now Nibbana) paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhī: to be verified by the wise for themselves. 

However, I imagine 'ignorance' ('avijja') literally means an underlying 'lack of knowledge' or 'blindess'; where as 'moha' ('delusion') literally refers to the defiled overt manifestations of that lack of knowledge, such as 'self-view', 'selfishness', 'ingratitude'; 'fear', 'doubt', etc. 

Women who know only one man sexually and have a reasonably moral husband will instinctually, for the most part, remain fiercely loyal & bonded to that man & particularly to their family. This is why virginity is cherished in basically every major religion and this is why sexual misconduct either by a woman or towards a woman taints a woman. Her natural instinctual bonding can be lost; which also explains why in our current era of sexual liberalism there are so many struggles by women (and men) in maintaining relationships; why so many women are hungry ghosts; why so many women are using antidepressants; and why so many women crucify a man in divorce out of revenge. AN 6.52 states:
