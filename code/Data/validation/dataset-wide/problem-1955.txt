Nobody knows you have idle time Your team is being "rested" for a big project around the corner Your team is getting close to being laid off Management is too dysfunctional to plan far enough ahead to give you new work 

Strike the right balance between: initiative, asking for help, and checking to make sure you understood your assigned task. 

Dear ..., I'm looking forward to the opportunity to work for ... Last we spoke, you indicated that a background check may or may not be needed. I have neither received an offer nor have I heard about the potential background check. Are you still interested in having me work for ...? If so, what is the next step in the process? Regards, ... If you want to be pushy and force their hand, call them on the phone. Don't bother sending an email. Call your point of contact (preferably the person you'd be working for) and ask if the position is still open and about the next steps. It is rarely HR that has an incentive to fill positions, it is the manager you'll be working under. Go straight to that person. 

If you have a compelling argument, then you can legitimately ask for the education expense. If not, back off and save your own money. Then take time off from work, go to school full time and get the degree / training you seek. Making the financial argument I made above may be to your advantage. Even if your numbers are off a bit, it'll show somebody that you understand the investment and the gamble. If I were your manager, I'd send you to (x1) semester at a time to see if you were dedicated. If you got a B+ or better in the class, I'd reimburse you for the courses after you showed me your final grades. I'd only pay for classes that were based upon hard skills (e.g. skills that were directly applicable and likely not theory) and not soft skills (e.g. abstract learning that did not directly affect the creation of products / revenue / profit for the company. I value loyalty and knowledge of the business. Less experienced (enlightened?) managers do not. Be careful about over stating your value to your company. 

If you're really talking about capitalism, these are the things that should be on the forefront of your mind. These do not revolve specifically around age. That being said, you seem to be self conscious about your age. You seem to think that your skills won't be valued because of your age. When you reach a situation like this and you realize that you may perceive the situation different than the other party (e.g. your employer), don't immediately assume that they are wrong. They may be right in that your age may limit your value to the company if all other qualifications seem equivalent. More experienced people (and employees) tend to understand many intangibles about business that make them more attractive: 

Nothing in life is for free. Don't expect a raise or a better offer unless they really need you and you're worth the money. If you're worth the money, they'll give it to you and you should perform well. If they don't give it to you and you are truly worth the money, keep looking for somebody that appreciates you. Don't take it personally. Recognize that you may be worth more to somebody else - it is not their fault or your fault. Not all employers value the same person the same way - just like not all people value the same car / house / stocks the same way. 

California recognizes independent contracts as being independent of their employer. Assuming one qualifies (e.g. several clients, independence, ...), my client is getting worried about liability insurance. I don't think they are worried about my work product causing a problem. I think they are worried about being sued by me if I get injured. Seems silly to me. We all have many opportunities to sue. However, my understanding is that injury on the job is all my problem. In other words, I can sue them just like a customer could sue them for getting hurt on their property. However, if they hurt me on the job, then my liability insurance won't come into play; it is their liability insurance that is at stake. What benefit would an employer gain from my liability coverage other than errors and omissions or similar? 

Know compensation for similar positions. Use salary surveys, private information, ... whatever you can get your hands on. Pay attention to regional differences throughout the U.S. Also keep in mind sectors are different (healthcare, semiconductor, ...) Estimate what you are worth to your potential employer. If you expect to make $100,000 then bear in mind that the employer is spending $130k - $200k in salary and benefits (sometimes more). In addition, the first 6 - 12 mos. a new employee is not really at 100% efficiency. So, investing in a new employee is expensive regardless of your expertise. Understand how money flows in the company from customers to you. Can you really produce $200k of revenue each year? Are you going to produce (by virtue of your work and your subordinates' work) more than $200k per year. If so, how are you going to do that? Never use 'he or she got that, so I should too'. No employer I know is going to listen to that. You just sound like a little kid complaining. I don't want to hire a complainer. It is not negotiating if you can't walk away. If you think that you must take whatever offer you're provided, you can't negotiate. Unless you can walk away and say 'no thanks', you're not really negotiating. Be reasonable. I already lived through (x1) Dot.com boom / bust. Friends were getting (x2) the 'standard' consulting rate to take ridiculous work. Be ethical and reasonable and you'll get respect - that is worth a lot more than an extra $100/week. Give something to get something. Offer to take on specific job functions, management, documentation, training of others - offer something your employer values to get something you value. Don't negotiate for future raises. It never happened for me - all the promises of promotions or salary adjustments or bonuses never materialized. Negotiate for the here and now, not some promise of a 'review in six months'. Use the job as a learning experience for the next negotiation. If you don't think you can truly negotiate for more money or if you don't get what you've asked, decide if the organization can 'teach' you something intangible. Face it. If you're asking StackExchange for advice, you may lack the experience to negotiate strongly. Look at the advice you've been given and try to figure out in your existing job or in this new opportunity what you learn to negotiate better the next time. 

If you need the job desperately, fill out the paperwork and wait for the offer. If you are not desperate, I suggest the following 

Remind them about me and the last items we discussed Tell them the status so they are informed. They might be surprised that nothing happened. Tell them what I will do or what I want them to do. Give them a way out of an awkward situation. Give them an opportunity to say 'no thank you'. 

Letters of Recommendation are very specific to certain sectors and work (e.g. graduate school, military intelligence, ...). Most references are personal not letters. I advise asking existing professors / employers if they would provide a reference for a job, not a letter of reference. That means the employer may call them and ask them about you. You need to have made a specific impression upon the person providing the reference. I have written Letters of Reference for graduate programs for colleagues. They have all been confidential. The schools always require that they are. I have been a reference for many people as well. Typically I only get called when it is with respect to either a Security Clearance or a large employer (e.g. 50,000 employees or larger). 

Nothing in life is for free. Don't expect a raise or a better offer unless they really need you and you're worth the money. If you're worth the money, they'll give it to you and you should perform well. If they don't give it to you and you are truly worth the money, keep looking for somebody that appreciates you. Don't take it personally. Recognize that you may be worth more to somebody else - it is not their fault or your fault. Not all employers value the same person the same way - just like not all people value the same car / house / stocks the same way. 

Waiting Waiting is appropriate at times, especially when you don't deserve something. However, looking for a new position or new responsibility is not something you need to wait for somebody to ask you about. Ask yourself if a manager would be happy having you on the sales team. Would you be successful? Would you be an asset to the sales team? Many times, there isn't a "open position", the position is there for you to open the door. Never go after it for the money It is rare for a professional to be able to change themselves to fit a new job. Your question about this situation makes me wonder if you really want this type of job. Why are you seeking a sales job? You wrote that it was not in your "plan". Is that because it is not a job you respect? enjoy? Many people consider sales for the money. Is that really what you want? Can you be successful at a job that is not in your plan just for the money? Don't base you search on rumors, base it on whether or not you'd be good at the job Nobody I know wants to give somebody a job because they are rumored to be good at it. They want people that will be good at it! If you will be good at sales, then you have a legitimate reason to inquire. I would ask a manager in sales: 

Careful... you may be barking up the wrong tree. I advise you to think about it from the employer's perspective. What do they gain by spending money on you for education? Why should they invest in your advanced degree? training? coursework? You point out that it is expensive. Why do you think your employer won't think it is just as expensive? My former advisor asked me to entice local companies to sponsor a PhD. I asked my advisor how much it would cost. At the time it was $75,000 / yr with a (x5) year commitment. I don't know any companies that are < 1000 employees that would invest $375,000 without a high probability of a (x10) return. Work out the math. At an expense of $75,000 / yr and gross margin of 50%, the company would have to sell $300,000 / yr of product to fund your education (at no profit to them). Can you guarantee this? Assuming the company is funded by a Venture Capitalist, the numbers are more crazy: a (x10) to (x100) multiplier on any investment. This means the $75,000 / yr investment must turn into $750,000 / yr to $7,500,000 / yr of your education. Change the numbers as you wish, but the concept is the same. Now look at the opportunity cost. They hired you and trained you for (x4) years. If they replace you, an average employee is not productive for 12 mos. So, hiring a replacement (that may already have the degree / training you seek) may cost $60,000 to $120,000 in salary. Add the benefits and overhead and you can estimate this as roughly (x2) the salary. So, the cost of firing you and hiring your replacement is roughly $120,000 to $240,000. Most companies don't do this actual math, they merely intuitively understand the costs and benefits. The question you need to answer is: 

Email is lame for solving problems. Real problems get solved by speaking directly with people. Several options to consider: 

I've never heard of it being against the law to discuss compensation packages. Is this in writing from your employer? From this ($URL$ ) it does not appear to be the "law of the land" in the U.S. If you signed a non-disclosure when you were hired, you may have given up your right to discuss certain topics. A good NDA is written in a way that requires the disclosing party to label / document / summarize the information that is confidential. Most employers don't have that clause, they just put in a vague statement that captures ever possible case. Signing an NDA like that should be a last resort (like you can't get any other job). It sets you up to be on the short-end-of-the-stick in a dispute. They can merely claim that it was "obvious" that compensation was confidential, although I would disagree with this expectation. Step 1. Read any NDA you signed when you were hired Step 2. Discuss with HR informing them that you'd like to seek outside advice. For example, you should have the right to get advice from a relative (e.g. parents) or a professional (e.g. tax attorney, tax accountant, or financial planner) Rather than seek out an adversarial position, describe you legitimate concern and ask for permission. 

All the organizations I've worked for like people to come up with new ways to do things that make the product better. These are more appreciated when they are easy to develop and deploy. That can mean some legwork to actually get new ideas to be accepted. Don't worry about your supervisor. They'll be happy when you've come up with something useful, especially if you (graciously) let them take the credit. 

Be careful. Don't mistake work for a social club. It is not. You're there to make the company productive, not to make friends. Concentrate on being the best employee you can be rather than the most popular with a woman. On the other hand, if you suspect you have an offensive behavior, seek out your manager's advice or the advice of HR. Explain to them that you noticed that an employee is not responding to you very well. You're concerned that you may have a personality trait that is not conducive to work. Ask if there is anything you should be doing to get along better with your co-workers. Women get harassed at work on a regular basis. Be careful you're not being misinterpreted as someone that is striking up a workplace romance. Be professional. Avoid dating co-workers or even giving the impression that you'd like to date them. Focus on being productive. 

I have always negotiated for better salaries. I have never taken the offer 'as-it-stands'. That being said, I'm now self-employed! Rules I apply: 

I'm interested in working for places that want to interact with me, not send me messages of convenience. I get more out of talking to somebody that information from an email or text. It seems to be you are trying to either: 

You need to balance your market worth against the costs of being independent. X2 Rule of Thumb Assume you will be fired at any time because you're a contractor. Ask for at least (x2) what it costs to survive. This sets your target at 50% employment to live the way you are living today. Know your costs Being independent is not trivial. You need to pay your other half of Social Security (+7% of gross wages) as Self-Employment tax. You need to provide your own healthcare ($1,000 - $3,000/mos.). You only get to deduct honest business expenses (e.g. mileage, conferences, books, software, computer and NOT clothes, personal items, ...). Don't ignore the cost of retirement. You'll need to set aside money for a 401k or similar. If you think you're too young to save, think again. If you work until 65 yrs old, you'll need at least 15 yrs of cash to survive (esp. when you need more healthcare). That's 30% of your working life! You'll need to save roughly 30% per year to survive in a zero inflation economy. Cash Flow Be prepare for at least 30 days wait to get paid. First to get **** and last to get paid. You'll be last in line after employees to get paid for your work. Have enough savings to ensure that waiting 30 - 90 days won't get you evicted from your home / apartment. Always be hustling the next gig You never know when you'll be out of work. Always be looking for a new job. You can't easily do that if you're working 40 hrs / week for somebody else. Be prepared to set aside some time to get more work and perhaps not get paid while you search for work! Sign reasonable agreements Be careful about onerous NDA's and Contractor's Agreements. Ensure clauses that allow you to exit, raise your rate, and work for competitors (but not at the same time). Know what temps are being paid Know your competition. Know what salaries are being paid. Know what hourly rate is being paid for somebody doing the same job you plan to do. Be prepared to walk away If you can't say 'no' and walk away, you're not negotiating... you're just complaining. 

Don't be too quick to judge the speed of the response. On the other side, they have a lot to do running a business. I was taught to hire slow and fire quickly. They may be just hiring slow. Also understand that this is a capitalistic enterprise (I think? This is not a non-profit .. is it?). They are in business to make money. The less that they pay for your services, the more that they can either keep for themselves or invest in another part of the business. Don't fault them for negotiating. Be suspicious and candid with yourself about their change in the offer. Did the make you a firm, initial offer? If so, it seems disingenuous to change the offer. Did the person making the offer act too quickly? Perhaps the original offer was not bona fide and therefore that person really just over stepped their bounds. Trust you instincts - was it a miscommunication / misunderstanding or really a change in the offer. Know your value - can you afford to walk away?
