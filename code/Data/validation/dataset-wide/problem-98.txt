This is the key. The device sensors are not just detecting passive emissions, they pick up actual data streams (or what can be identified as data streams - e.g. a signal with a digital basis - two levels, on and off). These have been started because the device detects (or is turned on) by an active sensor signal. When this is noticed the data is analyzed and someone (or a computer designed for pattern detection or something like that) decodes enough data to determine a basic encoding in the stream (which is repeating ?) and there's some kind of location embedded in it. How do you encode that ? Well we did it this way. :-) There are various ways to encode a digital signal with a basic image that can be detected. That could tell us a location with enough accuracy to locate another galaxy. 

The US Military would not. Why ? Gravity. In simple terms the "rebels" have the ability to create an effectively arbitrary number of rocket powered rocks (and I mean large rocks) to hurl at any point on Earth they want. They can wipe out large chunks of the surface. They can do this because the Moon's gravity is a fraction of Earth's and it also lacks an atmosphere. It's essentially down hill most of the way for the object coming from the Moon. And conversely it's mostly uphill for the object coming from Earth. They have the high ground, and it's fabulous high ground. For them to send a rocket powered rock to Earth, that will become a large and deadly meteor, is a relatively low energy task. They've got the fuel (Oxygen and Hydrogen) and they'd got rocks, so no problem making rudimentary rocket that do the deadly work. They'll quite simply use this threat as a weapon of last resort. Try and take us over and we'll kill you all. Simple. This policy has a name : it's called MAD. So there is, ultimately, no "win" scenario for the US military. They can draw, but it's a draw where e.g. every large metropolitan area of the US is a wasteland. It's not really possible for the Moon rebels to win, but they'd gain superpower status politically because being able to kill everyone is a pretty big stick diplomatically. Short version : shoot the generals who want to attack the moon before the idiots doe something stupid and get everyone killed. Now an early first strike might prevent the rebels from preparing this (very obvious) deterrent. However the rebels also have another advantage - the Chinese. The Chinese would be looking on thinking "If the US succeeds in taking that base back, they might get greedy and try it with ours.". Diplomatically they'll scream bloody murder and everyone's missiles will start going to alert status "far too high". And even if the rebels can't get the Chinese to back them willingly, they can immediately threaten to launch every rocket they have against the Chinese base if they are attacked. Now the correct way to deal with this is, of course, diplomacy. 

This achieves what I wonder ? My knowledge of alloys is limited, but I can't think of a particular advantage of mixing iron and calcium. I think you might need to read up on the complex structure that is typical animal bone. 

However the reaction of normal player groups who are nowhere near as powerful as your super-group would be deeply resentful. Super-groups in a multi-player RPG world are generally toxic in my limited experience of these things. At best they're an anomaly everyone else has to work around, and at worst they're the idiots that wiped out all your hard grind and set you back to zero. Super-groups and super-players need constraints in games in my opinion or they take all the fun out of it. In a magic setting I'd suggest that if they get too powerful they "irritate the Gods" who prevent them interfering with their believers - something like that. 

The first problem is that an race with that level of technology would have no way of knowing how long a material or structure would survive. Even the concept of wear and tear, weathering and corrosion over such large time scales would be beyond their ability to estimate. It's doubtful the concept of a time scale that long would meaningful to them. It's doubtful we could make a structure that would last that long. To put this in perspective, the oldest known structure is about 7000 years old (less than a tenth of your goal). It's worth reading it's history under modern man to get a feel for what happens old structures. Doggerland Making this even more challenging is that over the course of such a long time scale, geography changes in quite considerable ways. The best example is Doggerland. Until about several thousand years ago there was no North Sea and you could walk to France from the UK ! This is the kind of change that can happen in thousands of years, and the kind of changes your builders would have no comprehension of. Anything they build could be made a mockery of by geology and time. Some psychology. Take a container about the size of a biscuit tin. Bring it to work and put a large sign on it saying "do not open - deadly snake inside". How long do you think it would be before someone decided they had to know if there really was a deadly snake inside and that opening it was the best way to find out ? People are curious and telling them they can't open something to see for themselves is just asking for trouble. Now let's apply this to your mysterious prison. Over the course of 100,000 years it is inconceivable that no matter what you say about what's inside, someone won't open it up. And that's assuming they actually understand your warnings. And that's not new. The people in your story planning to build this would know that as well - it would be a fact in their day as much as in ours. So ... 

Not even close. Probably you'd create an incredibly unstable system with an ever-growing mass of disaffected and angry population who have been punished for someone else's crime. 

However the correct solution may simply be to use blood donations to feed vampires. Doubtless there are plenty of people who would willingly engage in a trade of supplying blood for money. And given the nature of humans there would be plenty who would make this part of the dreadful "trade" of illegal human trafficking. If you want to consider the idea of an "industrial" basis of blood production using blood donations, this page on how often you can donate blood would be useful to work from. 

Nope, I think that real life physics and reasonable statistical chance will get you what you want. The Catch...* A planet being in a habitable zone does not mean it can currently support life. There's an idea called the Fermi Paradox. It boils down to this : we expect life to exist wherever it can and we've found places it could. So where is everyone and why haven't we met aliens (tin foil hat brigade - go away ! :-) ) ? The current thinking is that civilizations may well develop, but they develop at different times and they die out long before they ever get a chance to meet living civilizations elsewhere (because the speed of light and the distances makes that hard). Which may mean that even if the planets were once in an Earth-like state, they may simply no longer be (as a result of natural processes, not anything dramatic). And that would cut the odds of finding your region of Earth-like planets down. But it's still a big galaxy and I'd suggest that for fictional purposes you can create a region like that and feel safe enough you're not going off the deep end. And it's a lot more likely that finding not one, but three galaxies populated almost exclusively by humans who speak English ( I love Stargate but park your brain when watching :-) ). So by these standards you are on solid ground.
