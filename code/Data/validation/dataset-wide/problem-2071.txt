But the reality is that careers tend to be far more fluid than that. You will be in a field that is ever-changing. You have learned some, but you'll learn a lot more on the job. Then the domain will change, and you'll have to learn more. Then it will change again and you'll learn even more. Going to college has taught you how to learn. Don't forget that - it will serve you well all through your career! 

If the company has a widely-known public reputation for making promises to potential employees and not following through, then you may be able to convince a hiring manager that this is a great reason for you to leave the job in less than a year. (Although if it was that widely-known then an interviewer might ask you why you accepted a job there in the first place.) Otherwise, it might come across as an unhappy employee looking for a reason that will make him appear sympathetic. It's really just an unsubstantiated claim at that point. That may work, or it may work against you. Some of that may be a result of what your references within this company say about you, and about the company. Some of it may be a result of how you portray other aspects of your employment. If you come across as overly negative, what you say about the "promises" may be discounted. 

Yes. Since this was a company event, you can take the stance that the company should be responsible. State the facts as you see them. Then listen. I would expect a good manager to respond with something like "Let me see what we can do about that." And then I would expect your manager to find a way for the company to get you a replacement phone. If the manager doesn't respond along those lines, push a bit and ask "I'd like the company to pay for a replacement phone. Who should I talk to about that?" You may not get what you want, but you should ask anyway. If the company refuses, you can always approach the offending colleague. All of this assumes that you weren't drunk, and were acting responsibly at the time of the incident (i.e., that you were an innocent victim in the wrong place at the wrong time, and were not throwing people into the pool yourself). If that's not the case, then you must expect to assume at least part of the responsibility. 

Your mentor is right. Don't bring up the issue unless asked. But be careful here. If you come across as misleading or a liar, you may very well be dropped from consideration. Answering "I wouldn't miss a good opportunity for 1-2 months salary." in response to a question about staying at a company to get a bonus from your current firm isn't technically lying. But if that interviewer finds out that you couldn't stay for the bonus even if you wanted to, they may feel mislead. A typical interview question is "Why do you want to leave your current job?" If asked something like that, you should consider indicating that you are no longer working there. That could easily lead into a discussion as to why. Be prepared to answer why you were terminated, what were the bad terms, what you have since learned, and how you won't let that happen again in the future. Practice your answer. Make sure it comes across well. Enlist a friend to role play if necessary. 

You should have already done this when you first learned that they found out about your NDA violation. Do it now. 

Yes, I do think you are making too much of a big deal out of this situation. Simply tell your colleague that you appreciate his offer, but that you prefer to do this particular presentation alone. And tell him that you are sure your manager will let him do his own presentation at a later date. It's your presentation. Your manager asked you to do this, not the both of you. Just saying "no" in a respectful way should be sufficient. 

It doesn't matter what we think. The only opinions that matter are those of your Manager @Alice, and to a lesser extent @Bob. Taken out of context, I don't see anything offensive, but there may be a pattern here, or your company's culture may deem that offensive. 

If I wanted a new job for no more than a year, I'd become a contractor. I would use my skills for a one-year contract, or perhaps several shorter-term contracts. That way, I'd maintain my professional reputation, it wouldn't damage any future employment prospects, I wouldn't have to lie to anyone, and I'd still get paid. For me, my reputation matters quite a lot. If that isn't an option for you, consider sticking it out in your current company. Once you know for sure that there is a specific end date in sight, it often makes it far easier to tolerate unhappy circumstances. A year could go by very, very quickly. For me, I'd never mislead a company into thinking I wanted to be employed there when I knew I'd be leaving in a year. That's not something I'd like done to me as a hiring manager, and that's not something I'd do to someone else. Your mileage may vary. 

When I set up interviews for folks I'm trying to hire, after an initial phone screen, I usually have them meet with several people during their visit. I talk to these interviewers ahead of time, assign a "role" and give them an idea of what I'd like them to learn during the interview: 

It's unfortunate that a few bad times has soured you so much against an entire country, but if the job requires working with/for them and you feel this strongly, then just decline the offer. If you want to be honest, you tell the folks offering you the job something like "I'm sorry. I have been hurt very badly a few times from clients from [this country]. I told myself that I will never again will work for them, so I politely decline your job offer." Depending on the individual you are speaking with, you still may well come across as prejudiced (a bigot? a xenophobe? an anti-XYer?). In some sense of the word, you are one. But just maybe this company will hire you and only require that you work with clients from countries that you don't dislike - assuming that's your desired outcome here. You should decide ahead of time if what led you to feel this way about an entire country is something you would want to share with the hiring manager or not. Some interviewers would ask why you feel this way, some might not. If you don't want to be honest, you could make up any sort of lie, I suppose. That might help you not to come across as prejudiced, but you will of course be a liar. 

It's a business decision. Some companies prefer to have a highly variable workforce. This allows them to grow/shrink the teams rapidly based on project needs. It also relieves them of having to pay a "bench" of workers. Having a mostly-contracted force of programmers means it's far easier to bring in new people, and it's easier to get rid of them. The problem of attracting talent is shifted from the company itself to the manpower agency. The problem of letting people go (and any subsequent severance obligations) is also removed from the company. Particularly when the company's core competency is not software, this seems to be a growing trend. Some very large companies in several business sectors have taken this approach. I happen to work in the financial services sector and have seen this happen more and more over the years. I'm not saying that I think this is a good idea, or that programmers are anywhere near as fungible as some companies seem to believe these days. I'm just answering your "why they do it" question. 

Context is everything. In most settings, there is no harm in admitting you don't know something - provided this is something you aren't required to know. If you are in charge of HR, you might be expected to know the list of the current year's company holidays, or the policy for vacations, or what forms are required for hiring a new employee. Simply saying "I don't know" and walking away might be bad for your career. Instead, saying something like "Let me put together an email with the details for you" might be better. On the other hand, saying "I don't know" if asked about a movie you hadn't seen yet is perfectly reasonable. And any other reply might come across as odd. In many situations, it can be effective to say something like "I don't know. But I do know how to find out - let me get back to you." There's a line here between a candid admission of not knowing, and being deceitful, and the only way to know for sure is to understand the context of the question and reply. 

Every environment is different. As you saw in the discussion on Meta, the US is a big place with lots of differences (regional, industry-wise, and company-wise). But the fact that your boss "had to be quite stern to bring the discussion to an end" tells me that he viewed it unfavorably. If I worked there, that's all I'd need to know. Not taking no for an answer, when the "No" comes directly and repeatedly from your boss has been frowned upon in every company where I have worked in the US. In some companies this would be called "a bad career move". 

Chat with them only if you want to hear from them much more frequently than you currently do. Chatting with them sends them the message that you just might be tempted by the right offer. And it would be reasonable for an aggressive recruiter to keep peppering you with whatever jobs they have in their queue in hopes that you will be tempted. If you want to "get a wider view of the industry" and don't mind a lot of contact from a recruiter, go ahead and chat. At certain points in my career, I did just that. But if you don't want to hear from a recruiter repeatedly and often, don't engage them. At other points in my career, I really didn't need to hear about the industry or open jobs. So I stopped chatting. 

No. Recruiters don't care what titles you turn down. On the other hand, many recruiters match your title with the title of positions they are trying to fill. They often assume that if you are a Senior Framis Engineer at WidgetsAreUs, that you are qualified to be a Senior Framis Engineer at AnotherCompany. Even though in many industries (like software) titles are basically meaningless across companies, many recruiters as well as others, act as if they matter. In one company a Senior might be someone with 3 years experience, while at another it might require 8 years experience. What matters the most is what you actually do, and what you actually know. 

Your education history comes across as confusing here, so I agree that it could be confusing to recruiters. You are free to include or exclude any part of your education history that you choose. Many folks do that when constructing their CV/resume. You can omit items for clarity purposes, and omit items that are not relevant to jobs you are seeking. In your case, I would probably do both. Unless there is some particular value to your lines of study that didn't end in a degree, I would omit those (as including them would mean you might have to explain why you didn't see them through to completion). Just make sure that these omissions don't leave your resume with awkward gaps in time that you would need to explain. To that end, you don't need to include the dates of study in your resume, although that may be asked during an interview.
