There are somethings that are best bought localy.The variation in sizes of shoes,gloves and helmets between brands makes trial fitting almost a necessity.Some online sellers do a better job than others of helping you decide if someones product runs true to size.Contact the sellers customer service department for guidance. If they have product ratings check them as it is often the reason for comments. 

They appear very similar to Avid BB5 pads.I would take your pads to your local shop and see if they match.The tab on the Avid pad looks to be a little longer but might fit.Tektro also has two numbers that look similar IOX.11 and L10.11 

If you stood the bike vertical, the hose could have been at the highest point of the reservoir. Any air in the top of the reservoir would have been introduced in to hose and caliper when you cycled the lever. I would rebleed the system and avoid cycling the lever when the bike is vertical. 

As other have commented since you can fill the tires with another pump the issue is not your tires. If you bought it at your LBS (local bike shop) I would bring it in and have them demonstrate its' proper use. If they can't get it to work they should replace it at no charge. While the listed capacity is 160psi, the amount of effort required to generate the pressure will vary with pump design. A larger diameter pump will require fewer pumps to inflate a tire but with more effort. While not as much of an issue with a floor pump the difference can be considerable with a small pocket pump. 

This from an old article circa 1996 it references a Medai floor pump. "Screwed into the base near the compression tube is an air tight steel chamber. This chamber is known as a reservoir and holds a volume of the compressed air to assist in equalizing the pressure of the pumps compression chamber and the inner tube. This feature gives the tire a small assist in time as it "seats" on the rim." 

I have heard that Shimano releases an updated or redesigned component line about every four years. The old technology then passes down to the less expensive product line. If this is true, theoreticaly a newer Ultegra component would be a better buy and possibly of better quality than an older Dura-Ace. So my thought is, can you reliably date a component that has no serial numbers or manufacture date. 

The Mosso web site doesn't give a full description. Looking at the photo it appears to be a carbon fork with an aluminum steerer tube. This is not an unusual combination. Many road bikes are offered with this setup. I can't say anything about the quality for the price perspective. I did recently purchase a factory Specialized fork that had a carbon fork and aluminum steerer and it was also $80 and that was from my LBS. 

If @ Daniel R Hicks suggestion doesn't work you might need some more intense maintainence. Remove the brake cables from the calipers. Then remove the brakes from the bike, disassemble them completely. Clean all the salt and corrosion from the shaft and the pivot holes of the brake arms. Lightly lube the pivot points and shaft (I am partial to white grease) with a small paint brush. Reassemble the caliper and remount. You may want to do just the front first, that way you have the rear as an example if you get confused during the reassembly. Once everything is cleaned up, a periodic rinse and relube should keep things moving. 

Often times you can remove the broken piece with a drill bit. Remove the cable from the adjuster. Soak the threaded hole on both sides with penetrating oil,(Liquid Wrench, Sea Foam, PB Blaster) avoid WD-40 or regular oils as they don't do a good job of freeing up frozen fittings. Start with a drill bit slightly smaller than the threaded hole. Drill at a slow speed. As you drill through the broken piece the drill bit will often grab the broken piece and screw it out through the opening on the other side. If this fails then you will need to get an EZ-Out Screw extractor as @Daniel R Hicks has suggested. If you are not familiar with using a screw extractor be very careful not to break the extractor by over twisting it. This a common problem with the small extractors that you will be using. They are made of very hard steel and cannot be easily drilled out if you break it off in the hole. I am not sure if they are all the same but my Jagwire derailleur inline adjusters have very limited adjustment. They are more of a fine tuner than gross adjustment. 

Also verify that it is a Shimano compatable cassette.It doesn't have to be a Shimano brand just Shimano compatable. 

I have two large hooks attached to my basement ceiling. I attach a 1 inch cargo strap (look for them in camping supplies) from the hook to my saddle and a second around the bars and stem. This suspends the bike while allowing the wheels and crank to spin freely. By adjusting the strap length I can position the bike so the area being worked on is close to eye level. The hooks were less than $3 and the straps were $3 each. 

First thing to come to mind is poor bike fit.Second is are you wearing cycling shorts?If you bought the bike at a local shop see if they offer a fitting service.If they don't see if they will show you how to make some adjustments to the saddle height,forward-aft,and angle so you can experiment to see what makes improvements 

Is it possible that the shifters were not in the correct position when you routed your cables?The front shifter should have been pointing to NUMBER 1,the rear indicating number 7. 

Since you are new to BMX I would find a good local shop that specializes in BMX. In my area the three largest conventional road/MTB shops don't carry BMX. We do have two very good shops that only sell BMX and skateboards. So don't be dismayed if the first shop you check has nothing you want. If you can't find one, stop by the local skate/bike park and see what everyone else that is riding. Ask where they go for service, repairs or parts. Like mountain biking, BMX has bikes specialized for specific styles. The frames and components are designed for the style. From what I have seen Flatland bike are designed for slow speed tricks on flat terrain. This is where handling and light weight are more important than the ability to survive big air. The info I can find seems to point to you able to do flatland tricks on a standard BMX frame. If you try to do some dirtjumping or big air tricks on a flatland frame it's lightweight frame and components wont take the abuse for long. Since you are new, your style and preferences will change. I would look for a good used bike, this is where a good local shop can help. 

According to Cannondales website they offer limited lifetime warranties on their frames. They also have a passage that states"The specific warranty covering your Cannondale bicycle is governed by the law of the state or country in which it was purchased, and applies only to bicycles purchased from Authorized Cannondale Retailers". That said my first stop would be the dealer that you bought it from. I would stop riding it until they check it out. You don't want a warranty denial due to the fact you rode it damaged. If you get an unsatisfactory response I would seek a second opinion from a shop that specializes in carbon frame repair. I believe most shops don't see enough frames to form a valid opinion. Or they fear litigation (rightfully so) and make a judgment for safety sake. You may save a few coins if you disassemble the bottom bracket so they can get a look inside the shell. I had a Cervelo R3 with a similar looking flaw. After having it checked by a shop (Hot Tubes) that does custom builds and frame repairs. They determined it was stress cracks in the paint. That was several years ago and it has not gotten worse.
