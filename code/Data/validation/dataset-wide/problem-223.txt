It actually works out much better than you would think. Let's work through what happens little bit by little bit by looking with our infinity-frames-per-second camera (it's made from unobtanium and the film is handwavium, shush). We're going to cheat with the units a bit though - we're working with a small prototype, so it's only got a surface area of one square foot. Also, the normal density of air has been tautologically redefined to be measured in units of normal density of air (one per cubit foot) (by density, here I mean the number of of particles per volume, not the standard definition). We start at time zero. The ship is there, the field is there, the air density is the same (one per cubit foot) at all places around the field. No space has been created or destroyed. All is normal. Time to skip ahead by a fraction of a nanosecond. Time one. The ship and field have moved forward by one foot. A cubic foot of space has been destroyed and recreated at the back. Statistically speaking, half of the air in the destroyed cubic foot stays in front of the ship (therefore the air in front of the ship has density 1.5) and half is moved to the created cubic foot (which then has density 0.5). Time two. The ship and field move forward by one foot. A cubit foot of air is destroyed and recreated at the back. You get the idea. Again, half the air moves forward and half moves to the back. The back cubic foot has density 0.75, and the front cubic foot has density 1.75. Time three. Same deal. The back cubic foot has density 0.8.75, and the front cubic foot has density 1.875. Skip ahead, time eight. The back cubic foot has density 0.996, the front has density 1.996. At time ten we're at 0.999 and 1.999 respectively, and I'm just going to stop there. See, what you have here is the magic of limits. Since your Genesis Field basically works by continuously halving whatever matter is in front of you, you're never going to get a major buildup that gets out of control. The amount in front never reaches above double the standard air density -- which makes sense, if you think about it. You're halving whatever you have in front and adding one, so as long as the amount you're adding is less than one, you're never going to reach two. So then in the back, you're going to have 0.5, 0.75, 0.875, .... 0.999, 0.9999,...... Almost, but not quite, reaching standard density. The less dense air at the back would be (relatively) slowly filled in by the surrounding pressure. So all in all you'd be fine using this in an atmosphere. Yes, you're doubling the number of molecules in the air in the space in front of the field, which would double the pressure, but that's still less pressure than is in a bicycle tire (scroll down to the 100 kPa range). TLDR, bicycle tires exist, therefore your warp drive won't blow up the atmosphere. 

Assuming that they don't have any sort of cloaking technology, the various space agencies will have probably seen them before they reached Earth. We have a LOT of satellites orbiting the Earth, and lots of signals going back and forth. It would get in the way of something, and would be noticed. If it somehow managed to crash land without a space agency seeing it (or an air traffic control tower seeing it), it basically becomes a question of "How long would it take for word of an actual UFO crash to reach the government?" However, it also depends on how obvious it is that it's an alien spaceship. Long story short, though, in this day and age, not very long. The main issue here is that while we don't have evidence of extraterrestrial life, we likely have protocols in place for contact scenarios. And I'm sure that one of the scenarios that have been considered is "Alien spaceship crashes on Earth". Let's play out one hypothetical scenario. Late at night: Farmer Brown is awoken by a loud noise (the sonic boom caused by the ship entering the atmosphere). We're looking for worst-case scenario, so he ignores it and goes back to sleep. 0500: Farmer Brown wakes up, remembering the big noise from last night but dismissing it. After all, he's not crazy! 0800: Farmer Brown is doing morning maintenance checks. He makes it out to the far reaches of his farm and... What the hell is that? A big burning hunk of metal... 0805: Farmer Brown calls local law enforcement to report that something has crashed in his farm. He hangs up, takes a picture, and posts it to Facebook. 0830: Law enforcement shows up. It doesn't look like any airplane they've seen, but since they can't find any bodies no alarm bells are immediately run. They take some blood samples to try and identify who was on board. 1000: The lab technician calls his boss down to his office. "What the hell is this sample? Those are not red blood cells. In fact, I'm not sure what they are." 1005: Lab tech's boss is confused too. He puts in a call to his friend, a tech in the nearest big city. Emails are exchanged, data is sent, and a sample starts being driven. 1200: The sample arrives. Big city lab tech decides to take a late lunch because the data was interesting and he wants to see it for himself. 1215: He's confirmed it's something weird, called his boss, and his boss's boss. They're all confused. Boss's boss goes to the chief, who pulls a favor with the local FBI office. 1300: An FBI lab tech shows up with a few higher ups, confirm that it isn't blood. They nod at each other behind their sunglasses, one with a microphone in his ear steps out of the room while pulling out a cell phone. 1330: The IT division at the FBI has found Farmer Brown's Facebook page; the picture of the crash is confirmation. The director has been pulled out of a meeting and briefed; he has an unscheduled meeting with the President in half an hour. Field teams are being dispatched to the crash site. 1500: The field teams have arrived at the crash site. They provide final confirmation that this is not human in origin. But there's blood-equivalent on the floor... That means that whatever the ship belongs to is wandering the countryside. The area is sealed, and teams are dispatched to search the surrounding area for signs of the aliens. See, the biggest difference between now and the old alien crash site stories is that now we have instant communication across the entire country. In the past, we'd need Farmer Brown to get back to his house to call the sheriff, wait at home to meet the sheriff to show him where it was.... It takes a lot less time to pull out your cell phone. So, long story short, I'd say that the government would likely find out in less than a day, even less if we can skip a few steps (ie the sheriff wakes up when the ship crashes and goes to investigate). Two or three days at max, but that's pushing it. 

"What would happen to the economy" is one of those weird questions that is both incredibly broad and too narrow to work with at the same time. This is because the economy is tied so closely to everything else. That said, here are some of the quick and "easy" answers. TLDR, not a whole lot changes. The mirror business increases. Kind of a cheap answer, but it would happen. Mirrors can open doors to another world, but only if they happen to be in the same place. There would be a (temporary) uptick in mirror purchases as people try to make portals. Drugs and other restricted substances become legal. Or at least they become as legal as they are on the version of Earth where they are most legal. Otherwise it would become an effectively unenforceable crime. Suppose heroin is legal on ~Earth, but not on Earth. It would be really easy to get your fix through your mirror. The governments of Earth would therefore want to legalize it so that they could get the taxes from it. Stores are able to help each other. Imagine something like a Walgreens, only it never has to worry about running out of things, because they can just ask for extra from the other side of the mirror. This is great for smaller stores, assuming that they're a similar store to their mirrored store. Tech companies have a field day. While everything is the same up until 2008, that's eight years of technological development that took two similar but different paths. Not tons of time to diverge significantly, but there'll be some successful ideas on each world that never made it on the other. Maybe ~Earth's initial version of Uber failed because they started it in a different city where it didn't get as big of a market share as it did on Earth. There won't be tons of new information, but any little bit will be grabbed and expanded upon. HOWEVER, they now effectively have double the number of workers. Apple wouldn't have two teams both independently developing the iPhone 7, they'd have one team work on developing it and one team work on something new. Cross-world production. In a similar vein to the last sentence above, why have factories in two worlds producing iPhones when you could do it with one? Particularly the larger corporations would divide the work so that Earth produces one set of products and ~Earth produces another set. Depending on what happens, this could lead to spikes in unemployment, but the savings from reduced production would probably free up money to simply move people to different types of jobs (e.g., a car company would re-train people who no longer make Car A to be able to help with the new increased production requirements for Car B). 

Gonna answer your two questions in reverse order. The main thing I'd say you have left to address is how the CMF is structured. Who gives the orders? It's outside any sort of government, so it would have to have an internal command chain (democracy doesn't really work when it comes to heat-of-the-moment decisions), but how is that originally established, before the CMF is well-established and they can promote people based on merit? Do the people contributing the most get to lead? Do the people closest to the conflict (with theoretically the most experience) get to lead? Who decides promotions, anyway, especially into the top leadership positions? The larger, more powerful states likely aren't going to like the idea of someone from a smaller/weaker state leading the armies, and/or would want their own families to be in safer positions, so what sort of checks would be in place to prevent bribery and corruption? As far as it actually working.... I can see it working in the short term. But in a few generations, I can see the families of the center states getting complacent, wondering why they're paying and sending their children to fight against this "phantom threat" that isn't actually threatening them. Then there's also the problem of the CMF being the only military power in the West. What's to stop some ambitious CMF leader from seizing power (the analogous Julius Caesar to OP's Alexander)? It would certainly happen eventually, once the CMF starts to realize that they're the only ones with the weapons, so there's no point in paying for services anymore when they could just take over and get things for free. 

Walls of Jasper: We have 300,000 square meters of wall to cover. Let's assume that each stone is 1 cm x 1 cm, or 0.0001 square meters. Therefore we need three billion stones to cover the wall. Double that for both sides of the wall. Fortunately, Jasper is cheap. At $2 per stone, give or take, the fancy walls end up costing us twelve billion dollars. (Also, your wall numbers aren't accurate, but it doesn't really matter - more on that later.) Sea of Crystal: 681m x 51m is an awful number; I'll call it 700m x 50m, or 35,000 square meters. Therefore we need 350 million stones (at one square centimeter each) to cover it, half of which are emerald and half of which are topaz. Note: In researching this it seems that my square centimeter estimate is rather large for gems; as such, I'll be scaling prices accordingly rather than recalculate, as you only want a ballpark estimate anyway. Emerald would go for about \$400 per square centimeter, while topaz is about \$50 per square centimeter. Average it out, it'll cost \$225 per square centimeter, or a grand total of eighty billion dollars (approximately). City of Gold: We need 400,000 square meters of gold foil. Amazon is currently listing gold leaf foil at \$50 for what works out to 0.15 square meters. Thus we'd need 2.7 million of them, so it would cost about 135 million dollars. Giant Golden Statue: I was a physics major in college, so I'm going to do what physics majors do best and assume that the statue is a sphere. 13 meters across is 512 inches (since you put the gold thickness in inches). The volume of gold is then about 412,000 cubic inches. That converts to 4.2 million troy ounces of gold. According to the NASDAQ, 24 karat gold is currently going \$1250 per troy ounce, so our statue will end up costing us just a touch over five billion dollars. But wait! That's before the gem-encrusting. The surface area of our statue/sphere is about 827,000 square inches, or 534 square meters. The average gem price I've used so far comes out to \$150 per square centimeter, so I'll just use that. Assuming we only want to cover the statue about halfway (after all, if you cover it all the way you can't show off the gold below!), we're covering 267 square meters for a grand total of just a touch under five hundred million dollars. So all in all we're looking at a grand total of about five and a half billion dollars. The Pearly Gates: Pearls have many different sizes; we'll say that the ones we're working with are one square centimeter (10 millimeters is a common size for necklaces etc, so that makes sense). The gates are about 50 square meters (12 * 5 is 60, take out some for the area you walk under). But wait! We have to consider the inside of the gates as well. Revelation says that the walls of the city are 72 yards wide (call it 70 meters because I'm lazy). Ballparking, the surface area of the interior of the gates will be about 800 square meters (we cut out basically a 5m x 2m hole for the gate, so about twelve linear meters, times 70 meters deep). Then we have to cover the other side of the gate as well, so a grand total of about 900 square meters, meaning we need about nine million pearls. But there are twelve gates, so we need 108 million pearls. Pearl necklaces are about a meter in length, meaning that they have about a hundred pearls on them. Estimating a thousand dollars per necklace, we get about ten dollars per pearl, so our gates cost us about 1.1 billion dollars. All told, we're currently just under $100 billion. Slightly out of reach of Bill Gates, atop the list of billionaires, but they could team up and buy this pretty easily. That, coupled with the fact that you wanted the answer in terms of ratio to the US GDP, makes me think that this number is just too small to be the ultimate holy city for an omnipotent deity. So I went back to Revelation to see what else I could add to put this city beyond the wallets of mere mortals. And lo and behold.... The Streets Paved with Gold: Revelation 21:21 tells us that the streets are pure gold. Assuming this means that gold is replacing asphalt, we've got us a LOT of gold here. But first... how many roads are there? Well, a city block is about 100 meters. Revelation 21:16 says that the city "is laid out as a square... 12,000 stadia in length....". A Roman stadium was a distance of about 185 meters. So the city is 2.2 million meters in each direction (remember how I said your wall numbers were off? Yeah....). At that point we'd have 22,000 roads, going both crosswise directions, so 44,000 total. Call it 40,000 to account for double-counting the intersections. Roads usually have asphalt about six inches deep, call it ten centimeters or 0.1 meters. If each road is then ten meters wide, each road has a cross-sectional area of 1 square meter, times 2.2 million meters long, for a road volume of 2.2 million cubic meters, times 40,000 roads. We have a grand total of 88 billion cubic meters of gold in our roads. Gold has a density of about 19,000 kilograms per cubic meter, so our roads weigh about 1.67 quadrillion kilograms (for scale, WolframAlpha says that's about 20 times the total biomass on Earth). That converts to $5.38 * 10^{16}$ troy ounces, which comes out to 67 quintillion dollars. That's just under four million times the US GDP. Much more heavenly.
