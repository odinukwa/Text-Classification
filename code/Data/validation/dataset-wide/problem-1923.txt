a) "I think every smart manager (which I consider mine to be) would prefer this mode of operation." - if you feel that your manager is not a control freak and if you suspect that he hardly takes out of his precious time to read every CC-ed email, then I see no reason why you should worry about anything at all; b) some correspondence is really important to document - e.g. discussing major decisions, stating your specific requirements for a task, etc. This is what project management platforms are for. And a lot of them have internal messaging functionalities, so all communication would get automatically documented and accessible to your manager. 

Hire a "professional communicator" to carry out the communication between you and those guys. Call that "professional communicator" as you wish - an HR specialist/ project manager/ psychologist/ psychotherapist/ etc - the idea is to have a person who a) has the knowledge, experience and brains to deal with difficult cases of communication and b) whose time is dedicated to this task only. Yes, such a person would cost money; yes, pricing his labour would perplex you; yes, discovering and recruiting the right person would seem impossible; yes, you may feel uncomfortable to have to hire somebody for a job you thought you could manage. But when hiring those talented developers, it was your omission that you paid attention to their technical skills and never considered that they were human beings who had to interact with other human beings and that interaction between human beings is neither easier, nor cheaper activity than programming and that more often than not developers tend to be human beings with notoriously poor social skills. 

When there's a scarcity of candidates, you would obviously need to expand your channels beyond the currently unemployed. Generally you have two more options: 

I personally would consider rewarding them with something related to their work - something which would either make their work easier or faster. That could be a fancy ergonomic chair/ desk/ mousing device/ keyboard/ etc or some kind of a special consultation with a guru in the field or ticket to a special conference, etc. As for a reward helping you get done work faster I would personally appreciate a one month of having a personal assistant or an experienced expert to consult with. A new super-fast computer or more efficient commuting solutions also count. 

You should have asked them to clarify what they meant, as pointed in the comments to your question. But, whatever they meant, I hold that a good response is an honest response. Are you ready to give "good responses" and then get a job in a social environment you dislike? Would you be happy simply getting a job and spending the working day with resentment or apathy? 

A less than perfect way would be to keep it short as pointed in the first answer. You could Briefly explain why you chose your other alternative over them, if they are smart enough to take advantage of honest feedback. If they had been a highly preferred alternative in your final decision, you could tell them under what circumstances you would do some occasional or freelance work for them. If they had been far too low on your list just politely inform them of your decision. 

No matter where and what you are working, you should always have alternatives around. The one who has alternatives is in a position to negotiate and have a deal. Otherwise you are entirely dependable on the disposition of your boss, whoever he is. So my answer is, take whatever you deem appropriate under the current circumstances - changing work profile/ establishing more contacts in the industry, whatever. It is not so important what exactly you are going to do now (I am not saying that it is not important, I am saying that it is not so important) as it is that you incorporate "at any place and time have at least one more work opportunity out there" as a practice of life. 

I see this as a problem with your company structure on the first place, not a problem with your colleague. The structure of your company obviously does not give you the freedom to decide who to work with. Moreover, if the situation is really the way you describe it, this restriction comes as a disadvantage to the company itself. From this point of view you could: a) ask your managers to change their policies so next time you choose your partner on a project or receive a budget to hire one yourself; or b) talk with your colleague about your standards of performance in a calm and constructive manner. Then proceed work and never fret if your colleague doesn't keep up to those standard. Ask for salary increase instead and do your part of the job top-notch and never care for the quality of the final product solely within the scope of your particular work. The rationale is that if your bosses insist on holding the power to decide who works with who, then, your professionalism should come at a price, given that they are actually sabotaging it. 

Let's take the perspective of this situation as more of a blessing than a problem, by way of giving you the chance to hone your managerial skills. The better manager you are, the less you need to know anything about the technical details of the work being done. What's more, lack of technical knowledge could prevent (unconscious) micromanagement on your side. So let's go through the checklist: a) project structure - "Getting more familiar with the project (desired outcome, expected timeline, etc) won't be a problem" - fine; b) human factors - any conflicts or tension between team members?/ enthusiasm level?/ any obstacles stealing out of productivity?/ do people feel appreciated and rewarded?/ is work interesting and inspiring?/ do people see possibilities for professional growth?/ etc - you do not need any knowledge on the technical side of things to cover any of these; c) quality control, decision making - well, come think of it, is it your job to have the final say on important decisions or is it to organize work in such a way that your team competently solve things among themselves (thanks to the mechanisms you have set up for them)? Is it your job to personally proof-check quality of work or is it to organize your people in such a way that they competently monitor, check and correct each other's work (thanks to the mechanisms you have set up for them)? A great manager should create the infrastructures/ the medium/ the soil/ the environment for the right events and let them happen on themselves rather personally act on them. 

My advice would be to test candidates with tasks from your daily support activities. Do role playing - you or someone else play the customer and then have the candidate solve the issue. You could water down the real life situations to make them easier to solve on the spot/ in a phone interview but do keep the underlying problem's structure. Then watch the candidate's behaviour. Is s/he intelligent enough to grasp the core issue in seconds? Or doe s/he picker at minor details instead and not help the customer at all? Is s/he friendly enough? Does s/he follow the customer's mood and speed of reaction or does s/he try to impose her/ his own over the customer? Does s/he seem to have the most important thing - the mindset of a problem solver and not that of yet another administrator who needs to follow a script and who needs excuses in formalities so as to do the minimum effort to help a customer? 

a clarification note: Why do I say this is the ideal solution? Because it's a win-win situation all three parties - you, the company and the guy you referred. You win double - you may get the respect and appreciation of the company because you did not leave them in the lurch - you offered them a capable guy and you would also most probably win admiration from the guy for referring him. The company wins because they are left with an option even though you have declined. And who knows, that guy might be even better than you. The guy wins an opportunity to get a new job or at least an opportunity to get inside view of a company in his field of work. Of course one may speculate that the company might not accept that suggestion or even deem it disrespectful. The guy might not like the company at all and regret spending time with them. But if you are really confident that the guy and company are a good match for each other, things should take a positive course naturally, unless you are wrong in your judgement. Even in the latter case, this is the ideal thing which you could undertake - and I am talking about the ideal thing you could do, no the ideal thing that could happen. 

Considering time and health (plus productivity) as the most precious resources, I personally would start the question of working hours first on the agenda, without any hesitation, nor regrets if they refuse my candidature because of my requirements. 

a) bearing with weronika's superb answer - keep a list of maintenance things to do, so that you can have it on hand when you feel unproductive - e.g. backup, unresponded emails, documentation, searching the web for better software tools, etc; b) other than that: help others. Even though it might be absolutely the same task if done on your own or done to help somebody else, the different perspective could dramatically change enthusiasm levels and creativity. Go around colleagues, visit some online community (e.g. Stackoverflow), answer easy questions, answer hard questions. I do not know if there is a special explanation for that, but I have found, at least for myself, that I would go beyond my comfort zones when dealing with someone else's request, simply for the sake of helping him/ her. (Nobody is paying me to answer this question of yours, right? :) Yet, I would be more than glad if my answer helps you and I would compulsively check my reputation status for changes, as well.) Helping someone in your professional field, apart from giving your brain some refreshment time, may also bring you a different and better perspective on your desk tasks or let you learn something new or at least help you systemize your current knowledge better in your mind. 

How do you make your company appealing to university graduates? - any internship program organised well, would do. You must give plenty of opportunity to young people to learn and you must be cautious not to engage their internship time with routine work or without a capable mentor. It is important not to mistake an internship program for a means for cheap labour. The internship program is your incubator for new employees and would not and should not come cheap as an investment. How do you make your company appealing enough to make developers already working somewhere else switch? - sloppy thinking points at increasing the salary. While that is a factor, it is not the key one. There is plenty research on this, just google "motivation factors on the workplace" or something like that. Here is the big question - how much do you consider HR activities to make the core of your business. My personal philosophy is that for any enterprise HR should be a mandatory activity of focus, regardless of the main area of business. If you currently think that your daily duties include managing employees, communicating with clients and keeping an eye on the financial balance, then I say, they should include thinking day and night how to attract and retain talent, as well. And if you accept and implement such a philosophy, then you'd easily come to ideas what else you could offer in order to entice capable employees to switch their current jobs to your company. 

Freelancers sometimes abandon projects in the middle, even if they realize they would not get paid. Reasons for such action could be traced back to the employer (the project manager), who is making the freelancer unhappy with the payment/ with way the project is being run/ with the overall communication process/ with lack of support and tools/ etc. Equally possible is that the reasons for abandoning a project may lay with the freelancer himself - e.g. he is generally unprofessional/ gets bored easily/ took over more projects than he could handle/ etc. My question is about the latter case. Let's assume everything is perfect on behalf of the employer (the project manager). How could you predict inclination in a freelancer to abandon a project (upon hiring that freelancer or within the first few days of work)?
