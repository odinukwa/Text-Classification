It's possible I suppose. A magnetic field is associated with curl aka "rot" which is short for rotor. The early universe could have had an overall magnetic field, or gravitomagnetic field, if it was somehow rotating. See Mark Hadley's Galaxy sized twist in time pulls violating particles back into line. Also see the universe may have been born spinning. But I think it's rather speculative stuff myself. 

Earth image courtesy of NASA, lines drawn by me Then see the Einstein digital papers, where Einstein said a gravitational field is a place where "space is neither homogeneous nor isotropic". This inhomogeneity isn't linear. You can plot it, using say optical clocks dotted throughout an equatorial slice through the Earth and the surrounding space. You plot lower slower clocks as lower down in a 3D image, and higher faster clock rates higher up. When you've finished your plot looks like this: 

I don't know of one. But then again I think there was no magnetic field at all at the very beginning of the universe. I can't point to any material that proves this beyond a doubt. But I can say that a quiescent black hole "has no hair", so it has no magnetic field, and the evolution of the universe is said to be something like pulling away from a black hole. See Hawking saying the universe is like a time reversed black hole here. 

No. We'd see the universe progressing normally, because we aren't subject to that gravitational time dilation. (I presume we're at a safe distance). Let's suppose it was a TV camera that took a picture 25 times a second and sent it back to us, adequately catering for redshift. The camera starts off taking 25 pictures a second as measured by us. But after a while we notice we're only getting 24 pictures a second, then 23, and so on. We see events in the wider universe progressing at their normal rate, but eventually the movie starts getting jerky as the frame-rate reduces. In the end the frame-rate reduces to zero, and that's the end of the show. 

It's a sliding scale. Generally the older the book, the more the chance of something being wrong. But it depends what books you're talking about. Are they text books? Or are they popscience books? Some books, even newish books, have a habit of presenting speculation as established fact. There's been a lot of trouble about inflation and the multiverse recently. Peter Woit talks about it on his Not Even Wrong blog. He says “the political campaign for the multiverse continues today with a piece by Amanda Gefter at Nautilus. It’s a full-throated salvo from the Linde-Guth side of the multiverse propaganda war they are now waging”. 

Speed exists. It might be relative to something else, even if that something is the universe. But even though it's only relative, that's no reason to say it doesn't exist. A bullet is just a harmless lump of lead that you can weigh in your hand. But a speeding bullet will kill you dead. Think about how that sits with "speed does not exist, but is only relative to an observer". 

That isn't true either. If you let these two bodies fall towards each other, their gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Then when the bodies collide some of this kinetic energy gets radiated away, and you're left with a mass deficit. But note that it's only a mass deficit. The two bodies don't disappear and end up as some zero-energy nothing. Besides, gravitational field energy isn't negative, it's positive. That's why Einstein said "the energy of the gravitational field shall act gravitatively in the same way as any other kind of energy". The point to note is that when you throw a 1kg brick up in the air you do work on it. You give it kinetic energy*. Gravity then converts this kinetic energy into gravitational potential energy, and the brick slows down. Note that this gravitational potential energy is in the brick, not in the gravitational field, or anywhere else. You did work on the brick, and when the brick is at the top of its arc, its mass is greater. Hence when the brick falls to Earth you end up with the mass deficit. Hence when you throw the brick upwards at 11.7 km/s, it's got escape velocity. It leaves the system, taking the original 1kg worth of mass-energy away, along with the mass-equivalence of the 11.7 km/s of kinetic energy. 

Yes AFAIK it's close to absolute zero. Or it's actually absolute zero. But not because matter is so closely packed. In fact there might not even be any particles inside a black hole. 

It's space. The paper concerned is Planck 2013 results. XXVI. Background geometry and topology of the Universe. They found no evidence of any "higher dimensional curvature". So if you could go thataway at some phenomenal speed, you won't end up coming back thisaway. 

There aren't many similarities. A gamma-ray burst is where some of the infalling matter is directed by magnetic fields generated by infalling matter and converted into gamma rays. The Big Bang is when the space of the universe started expanding. 

I don't know. I have no evidence to suggest that there's any kind of recycling going on, and I can't think of mechanism by which this might occur. I have of course read about "conformal cyclic cosmology", but I just don't buy it, along with other stuff from Penrose. 

It's hard to say. Dark matter, dark energy, cosmological constant, flatness of the universe, size of the universe, age of the universe. If you could name the books maybe I could look at the chapters. 

No. Space expanded, and space isn't nothing. As to what caused the big bang to occur, I don't know. Nor do I know what the universe was like 13.8 billion years ago. But I know of no infinities in nature, and I would challenge the alleged point singularity at the centre of a black hole and refer instead to the frozen star interpretation. In similar vein I would challenge the alleged point-singularity 13.8 billion years ago. 

It's simpler than you think. Look at the definition of the second and the definition of the metre: The SI definition of second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation... The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 of a second. You measure the local speed of light to be constant because of the way you define your seconds and your metres, and because of the wave nature of matter. Check out things like pair production and electron diffraction. Ask yourself this: if you and your rods and clocks were made out of sound waves, such that you defined your metres and second using the motion of sound waves, how would you ever measure the local speed of sound to be anything other than 340 m/s? Edit 14/09/2017: To check out what I said above, see this in the Einstein digital papers dating from 1920: "As a simple geometric consideration shows, the curvature of light rays occurs only in spaces where the speed of light is spatially variable. From this it follows that the entire conceptual system of the theory of special relativity can claim rigorous validity only for those space-time domains where gravitational fields (under appropriately chosen coordinate systems) are absent." The speed of light in vacuo varies. Also see this PSE answer which quotes professor Douglas Scott: "However, the crucial assumption of Einstein's theory is not that there are no special frames, but that there are no special frames where the laws of physics are different. There clearly is a frame where the CMB is at rest, and so this is, in some sense, the rest frame of the Universe. But for doing any physics experiment, any other frame is as good as this one. So the only difference is that in the CMB rest frame you measure no velocity with respect to the CMB photons, but that does not imply any fundamental difference in the laws of physics." Special relativity pre-dated the CMBR. Also see this in the Einstein digital papers, again from 1920: "Recapitulating, we may say that according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an ether". See Wikipedia and above for the definition of the second and the definition of the metre. They are both defined using light. 

CCASA image by Johnstone, see Wikipedia The upper image is a bit like looking at the lower image from underneath. But anyway, your plot is curved, and you made it using clocks in space, so we can say spacetime is curved. Note that whilst we started with a two-dimensional equatorial slice and ended up with a three-dimensional curved plot, there is no extra dimension in any real sense. All we're depicting is the "coordinate" speed of light. This might sound unfamiliar but again see the Einstein digital papers: "the curvature of light rays occurs only in spaces where the speed of light is spatially variable". Light doesn't curve because your plot of optical clock rates is curved. It doesn't curve because spacetime is curved. Einstein never actually said that. He said it curves because the speed of light varies. Hence the tilted light-cones on John Norton's course. Light curves wherever your plot isn't flat. Where the speed of light varies. It's actually rather like sonar: Image courtesy of FAS and the US Navy, see course ES310 chapter 20 

Because there's good scientific evidence that the universe is expanding. And when you "wind back the clock" you find that all the galaxies were in the same place 13.8 billion years ago. 

It does. When we look at the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation we see a "dipole anisotropy" due to the motion of the Earth relative to it: 

This analogy is often used to justify that the claim that the universe has no centre. But there's no evidence of any higher dimensions. We simply don't know that there's any kind of "asteroids" curvature such that if you keep going one way you come back the other. 

Nobody knows for sure. I imagine the answer is yes, and they're both spherical, but I don't actually know this. 

Well, everything is possible I suppose. And we do see plenty of material that talks about the expansion of the universe as a kind of repulsive gravity. But I would say no, the expansion isn't due to gravity, and it isn't some side effect of gravity. It's something different. 

There wasn't any matter initially. Remember the wave nature of matter, and pair production. We can quite literally make matter out of electromagnetic waves. These wave propagate through space, and are effectively wave sin space. So we make matter out of waves in space. So start with space, and do somehting to it such that it rings like a bell and is full of waves and starts expanding. As to what, I don't know. 

The edge of our observable universe is a horizon of sorts, see Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the Universe by Davis and Lineweaver. But it isn't the same sort of horizon as the black hole event horizon. 

Correct. Gravitational time dilation goes infinite, and the distant observer says the "coordinate" speed of light at the event horizon is zero. 

No, because gravity alters the motion of light and matter through space. It doesn't make space fall down in some Chicken-Little fashion. You may hear that it does, as per the waterfall analogy, but it doesn't. In similar vein the "reversed" gravity that you're suggesting doesn't make space fall up, as it were. 

See what Einstein said. A concentration of energy usually in the guise of a massive star "conditions" the surrounding space, rendering it inhomogeneous in a non-linear fashion. Then people call it curved spacetime. Note however that there's no overall gravity in the universe. As userLTK said the surface of the Earth is "lumpy", and in similar vein there are gravitational fields all over the universe. But to the best of our knowledge the universe is not like the surface of the Earth. On the largest scale, to the best of our knowledge, the universe is flat. 

Yes, that's a bit unfortunate, because he also says this: "galaxies with red shifts greater than ~3 were and are receding from us faster than light". 

That's what people tend to say, but IMHO you shouldn't treat it as settled science. See "The Waters I am Entering No One yet Has Crossed": Alexander Friedman and the Origins of Modern Cosmology. It’s by Ari Belenkiy, who credits Friedmann with the expanding universe. He also refers to Friedmann's m-for-monotonic M1 universe which expands from a singularity and has an inflexion point, his M2 universe which expands from a non-zero radius, and his p-for-periodic P universe which expands and contracts. The thing is, that we don't actually know for sure that any of these options properly describe the universe. Particularly since we have good evidence that the universe was once very dense, but nevertheless expanded. 

Space. Space-time is not flat because the universe is expanding. To get a handle on this imagine you dob a big glob of treacle down, and spray a (non-radial) line of cream across it. As the glob of treacle flattens and expands the line of cream will tend to curve. It's similar for a light beam in an expanding universe. If the universe wasn't expanding, the light would go straight. Then space-time would be flat. Note that space-time models space at all times, so there's no motion through space-time. The treacle represents space. Space is expanding, not space-time. Unfortunately people tend to get confused between space and space-time. 

It isn't the only way, Aaron. See the Wikipedia Methods of detecting exoplanets article. The first method listed is radial velocity. That's where we measure the Doppler shift of the star's "wobble". The second method is transit photography. And as you say it has a drawback. In fact there's more than one: "This method has two major disadvantages. First, planetary transits are observable only when the planet's orbit happens to be perfectly aligned from the astronomers' vantage point. The probability of a planetary orbital plane being directly on the line-of-sight to a star is the ratio of the diameter of the star to the diameter of the orbit (in small stars, the radius of the planet is also an important factor). About 10% of planets with small orbits have such an alignment, and the fraction decreases for planets with larger orbits. For a planet orbiting a Sun-sized star at 1 AU, the probability of a random alignment producing a transit is 0.47%. Therefore, the method cannot guarantee that any particular star is not a host to planets... The second disadvantage of this method is a high rate of false detections. A 2012 study found that the rate of false positives for transits observed by the Kepler mission could be as high as 40% in single-planet systems..."
