As written by Dan Petersen this was proved by A. Dold. In fact the computation of the homology of the symmetric products of a topological space turns out to be difficult over the integers and over a finite field. Such computations were done by J. Milgram in for $SP^n$ in the case $n=1,2,\infty$: "The homology of symmetric products." Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 138 1969 251–265. J. Milgram's computations rely on results of N. Steenrod wich can be found in "Séminaire H. Cartan 1954/1955" based on the theory of constructions. Then J. Milgram uses the fact that when $X$ is a connected CW-complex of finite type $H(X)\cong H(Y)$ where $Y$ is a wedge product of Moore spaces. This result is the key point that A. Dold uses in the paper cited above and you will notice that this result is false when we consider the cohomology algebra. 

This should be a comment to Robin's answer. Take any irreducible polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ of degree 3 with real roots, say $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$. Set $f_1 = x + \alpha y + \alpha^2 z$, $f_2 = x + \beta y + \beta^2 z$, $f_3 = x + \gamma y + \gamma^2 z$. You can find plenty of polynomials here. 

The existence of a finite $S_2$ follows from Hilbert's basis theorem, as $\mathbb{R}$ is obviously Noetherian. Just take a finite generating system of the ideal generated by $S$. About your auxilliary questions: a) This is wrong. Just take $f = x^2 + y^2$; then $\{ f \}$ has the unique zero $(0, 0)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, while it has no isolated zero in $\mathbb{C}^2$. b) The ideal generated by $S$ is finitely generated. The set $S$ itself does not needs to have any algebraic structure, unless you take the set of all polynomials which vanish in $p$ (then it is a maximal ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x_1, \dots, x_n]$). In any case, replacing $S$ by the ideal generated by $S$ does not change the zero set (variety) of $S$. 

..................................................... Edit 2: Concerning your first question, you can compare François Laudenbach's definition (which is so close in spirit to the very first definition of the loop product) with Cohen-Jones' definition in terms of Gysin maps and with Dennis Sullivan's definition given in his paper "String Topology: Background and Present State", they all give isomorphic algebra structures at the homology level. The proof follows the same lines as in the case of the classical intersection product. 

Here is an example (which is due to A. Dold) Consider the complex $A$ of free $\mathbb{Z}/4$-modules: $$\ldots\stackrel{2}{\rightarrow}\mathbb{Z}/4\stackrel{2}{\rightarrow}\mathbb{Z}/4\stackrel{2}{\rightarrow}\mathbb{Z}/4\stackrel{2}{\rightarrow}\mathbb{Z}/4\stackrel{2}{\rightarrow}\ldots $$ It is acyclic, thus the morphism $A\rightarrow 0$ into the zero chain complex is a quasi-isomorphism if this complex were $\mathbb{Z}/4$-DG-projective it would be a homotopy equivalence. But when tensoring with $\mathbb{Z}/2$ we get the complex $$\ldots\stackrel{0}{\rightarrow}\mathbb{Z}/2\stackrel{0}{\rightarrow}\mathbb{Z}/2\stackrel{0}{\rightarrow}\mathbb{Z}/2\stackrel{0}{\rightarrow}\mathbb{Z}/2\stackrel{0}{\rightarrow}\ldots $$ which is not acyclic, thus $A$ is not DG-projective. 

Sections to the morphism $X \to S$ are more or less $S$-rational points of $X$: if for example $S = Spec(R)$ and $X = Spec(R[x_1, \dots, x_n]/(f_1, \dots, f_m))$ with polynomials $f_1, \dots, f_m \in R[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, then sections to $X \to S$ correspond to points $(a_1, \dots, a_n) \in R^n$ with $f_i(a_1, \dots, a_n) = 0$ for all $i$. On the other hand, the elements of $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ can be seen as holomorphic functions on $U$. So the one kind of sections can be seen as "points" of the geometric object, the others can be seen as "functions" on the geometric object. 

First, let me show that $R$ is of finite type over $R_0$ in case $R_0$ is noetherian and $G$ is finite. For that, it suffices to show that every $R_g$, $g \in G$ is finitely generated as an $R_0$-module. Now fix some $g \in G$. In case $R_g = \{ 0 \}$, we are done. Otherwise, let $\alpha \in R_g \setminus \{ 0 \}$. As $G$ is a finite group, there exists some $n > 0$ such that $n g = 0$. As $R$ is integral, $\beta := \alpha^{n-1} \neq 0$ is a non-trivial element of $R_{g^{-1}}$. Now the map $\varphi : R_g \to R_0$, $x \mapsto \beta x$ is an injective $R_0$-module homomorphism. The image, $\beta R_g$, is therefore isomorphic to $R_g$ as an $R_0$-module. As $R_0$ is noetherian, every $R_0$-submodule of $R_0$ is finitely generated, whence $\beta R_g$ and thus $R_g$ is a finitely generated $R_0$-module. This shows that $R$ is of finite type over $R_0$. 

You will find an answer to your question in Hatcher's book project "Vector bundles an K-theory" (p. 75-76) (available on his homepage). Using the fact that $\pi_8(O(10))=\mathbb Z_2$, you can build a non- stably trivial vector bundle over the sphere $S^9$ (using the clutching function associated to the non-trivial homotopy class $S^8\rightarrow O(10)$ in $\pi_8(O(10))$). This vector bundle has all his Stiefel-Whitney and Pontryagin classes equal to zero. The vanishing of $w_9$ follows from Wu's formula $w_9=w_1w_8+Sq^1(w_8)$. 

Do you know the following survey: $URL$ I find it very useful, very nice to read and it contains plenty of examples. 

I am sorry but I will not answer your question rather it reminds me some beautiful results which go back to H. Whitney and is related to the transfer of the wedge product of forms. If you pick a triangulation $T$ of your manifold $M$ and consider the rational cochain complex $C_T(M)$ associated to $T$. You have an integration map: $I:\Omega(M)\rightarrow C_T(M)$ and you H. Whitney has defined an inverse map $W:C_T(M)\rightarrow \Omega(M)$ (we have to use $L_2$-forms in fact). We have $IW=Id$ and $WI$ is homotopic to the identity. These maps are not multiplicative with respect to the cup product and the wedge product. But H. Whitney has given a very nice combinatorial formula for a product on $C_T(M)$, let call it the Whitney product and let denote it by $\bullet$, we have: $$c\bullet c'=I(Wc\wedge Wc').$$ What H. Whitney has done is to give a very nice and combinatorial formula for the product of the $C_{\infty}$-transfer of the algebra structure of differential forms on cochains. But the story does not end here, if you want to add some geometrical data to the story you can build a combinatorial Hodge operator on cochains. And now look at the limit of all these structures when you refine the triangulation. In fact the combinatorial Hodge operator converges to the smooth Hodge operator and for the Whitney product all higher homotopy products will vanish in the limit. This was studied in details by S. O'Wilson in "Cochain algebra on manifolds and convergence under refinement", Topology and its Appl, 154 no. 9 (2007) 1898-1920. 

(Of course, this question is only interesting when $n > 2$.) I assume that this is a very hard problem, so I'd be happy about any hint on whether something about this is known, whether someone is working on this, how one could proof such things, etc. 

I don't know how good the bound is you can obtain from this, but what about taking a Korkine-Zolotarev reduced basis of $\Lambda$, say $(b_1, \dots, b_n)$: then, by this paper, $\|b_i\|_2^2 \le \frac{i + 3}{4} \lambda_i(\Lambda)^2$, where $\lambda_i(\Lambda)$ is the $i$-th successive minimum of $\Lambda$. By Minkowski, $\prod_{i=1}^n \lambda_i(\Lambda) \le \gamma_n^{n/2} \det \Lambda = \gamma_n^{n/2}$ (in your case), $\gamma_n$ being the $n$-th Hermite constant, whence you get $A \le \prod_{i=1}^n \|b_i\|_2 \le \frac{\gamma_n^{n/2}}{2^n} \prod_{i=1}^n \sqrt{i + 3}$. 

As written by Fernando, the answer is no if you suppose that you have exactness fo pairs at the chain level. In fact for a functor $$L_*:CW^{pairs}\rightarrow Ch(Ab)$$ if you have a short exact sequence of chain complexes $$0\rightarrow L_*(A,\emptyset)\rightarrow L_*(X,\emptyset)\rightarrow L_*(X,A)\rightarrow 0$$ and if the homology $\mathcal{L_*}=H_*(L_*(-))$ is a generalized homology theory then we have: Theorem (Burdick, Conner, Floyd 1968).To each finite CW-pair (X,A) we have a natural isomorphism: $$\mathcal{L}_n(X,A)\cong \bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_p(X,A;\mathcal{L}_q(pt)).$$ Ref: "Chain Theories and their Derived Homologies", Proc .

As Ryan Budney explained it is not a finite dimensional manifold. First let us notice that the space of all smooths loops $L\mathbb{R}^2=C^{\infty}(S^1,\mathbb{R}^2)$ is a topological vector space, it is Fréchet and it is an inverse Hilbert limit vector space. If you consider the subset $Emb(S^1,\mathbb{R}^2)\subset L\mathbb{R}^2$ of embeddings this is an open subset hence an infinite dimensional manifold of Fréchet type. Let us go further, so far we have considered parametrized curves, if we want to get rid of the parametrization we have to divide by the action of the infinite dimensional Lie group $Diff(S^1)$ and we get a smooth principal bunde $$Emb(S^1,\mathbb{R}^2)\rightarrow Emb(S^1,\mathbb{R}^2)/Diff(S^1)$$ I suppose that this is the base of this bundle you are interested in. Maybe a good reference for all this stuff is Kriegl-Michor "The Convenient Setting of Global Analysis." Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, Volume: 53 (Chapter IX, section 44). If you are interested by a discussion of Riemannian metric on these spaces have a look at: Michor, P. ; Mumford, D. Riemannian geometries on spaces of plane curves. J. Eur. Math. Soc. 8 (2006), no. 1, 1–48. 

A natural number $n$ is the product of precisely two prime powers if and only if there exists an abelian group of order $n$ having precisely two maximal subgroups. (And that group is unique up to isomorphism.) 

Assuming that $A$ has a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ (for example, by using Zorn's Lemma), one can proceed as follows: if $M$ is a free $A$-module with basis $(v_i)_{i\in I}$, then $M \cong A^I$, whence $M / \mathfrak{m} M \cong A^I / \mathfrak{m} A^I \cong (A / \mathfrak{m} A)^I$. This is a vector space over $k := A / \mathfrak{m} A$ of dimension $|I|$. Since over fields, all vector space bases of the same vector space have the same length, and since the $k$-vector space structure of $M / \mathfrak{m} M$ is independent of the choice of the basis, this shows that all $A$-bases of $M$ have the same cardinality. I don't remember where I first saw this though... maybe someone else has a reference? I saw this first in the case that $A = \mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathfrak{m} = (2)$ for free abelian groups $M$, to show that the rank is well-defined.
