In my opinion, make systems hard to reverse engineer also make them harder to fix and maintain (this is why I think self-destructing components are a very bad idea). Anyway I think there are two main ways of doing it : Laws If you trade with B there would be agreements shared by the both parts, and sanctions if not respected. You may have a galactic court of law that will ensure B respect the terms of contracts, or since A is more advanced than B there may be a way to... force respect. So, make licenses, patents and don't forget the fine print. Obfuscate ! 

If you don't want to slow down your bullet, increase the speed of sound ! In a pure sci-fi scenario you may make your bullet from a metal/composite/electronic device/... that heat up the air around it. Because the warmer the air is the higher is the speed of sound. You can alternatively burst a high energy infra-red ray to warm up the air just before shooting your bullet. By doing so the bullet will travel in an "air highway" and won't reach the speed of sound in that tube, and it will have a high speed kinetic energy ! For the math let us say your bullet travel at 900 m/s (muzzle velocity of a medium range weapon) we have : $$c_{air} = 331.3 * \sqrt{1 + \frac{T°C}{273.15}}$$ thus, $$T°C = (\frac{c_{air}^2}{331.3^2} - 1)*273.15$$ for a sound speed around 1000m/s (100m/s higher than the bullet) it would need air at $2215°C$ ! You don't want to put you eyebrows next to hit... Note : Warming the air so quickly at such a temperature would probably create a deflagration with a noise (and a force) bigger than your bullet. But still, the bullet is slower than the speed of sound is it ? 

Finally, I have done it. I have bought a large and beautiful four bladed windmill. A smock mill to be precise, really high and all functional. There is the whole ancient machinery in it, completely operational, I have tested it, just put sails on the blades and here I go, I can finally mill my own flour. But wait, I don't care about milling flour, there are much better ways to do it ! And further more it is almost the winter, and I don't have any radiator to keep me warm, further more the ceiling is really high, it will be hard to heat... Oh I have an idea ! Let's transform this, yet useless, wind power into heating ! No idea how to achieve this though... I am wondering how to use the rotational mechanical energy that the windmill is giving me into thermal energy. I would try to avoid doing the mechanical energy -> electrical energy -> thermal energy chain, because it would be too complex. I mean, we are always trying to keep up the energy efficiency by making our transformation systems to make less... thermal energy. But this is what I want to achieve ! Is there a solution to directly transform the rotational to thermal energy ? What would be the cost and the power efficiency of such a device ? Can I heat my windmill only by relying on the outside wind ? What wind would be needed ? What temperature can I have ? Note : Let's say I have restored my windmill a bit, and it is quite well insulated. 

With 6000 years without being on Earth, physical changes could be due to cultural or political changes as well as purely natural changes that JDługosz stated. For example, Isaac Asimov, in the robot series, make a clear physical distinction between people stayed on Earth and those who live on other planets (Spacers). Even if terraforming made those other worlds similar to Earth, political and cultural differences are huge. Spacers are tall, handsome, and they live 400 years. They have cleared all diseases and germs, and they are massively using birth engineering to select best criteria for babies. Thus, I think if a "natural" cause does not satisfy the changes you want, you can easily base them on cultural differences (birth engineering, food, religion, ...). 

Just put bunch of useless things in your spaceship. Plug cables in fake holes when in fact all is wi-fi, add blinking leds, countdowns and write notices in planet A language. A well taught engineer would know what is useful and what is not, while "engineers" from planet B will write tons of indications concerning this all chromed and shining pipe which go to... toilets. It won't prevent retro-engineering eternally but it could discourage and slow it. Finally, teach planet B with the minimal knowledge possible, force them to call you if they need a fix, or give 2 planet A engineers with each ship ("Oh really ? Thanks we don't even need to train our people."). Bonus : Watch on those hippie scientists who want everyone to be equal and to help less advanced people. Planet A does not make charity. 

Edit : Star Luminosity and Spacesuit Capabilities Based Answer I was wondering if there is a more physics-based answer and I think I found another way to calculate this orbit distance, but I am really unsure about this reasoning. Firstly, a classic current space suit can hold from −156 °C (−249 °F) to 121 °C (250 °F). Let's say that we want our spacesuit to be exposed at 100°C. We just have to calculate how far from the star the temperature is 100°C. (This is the unsure part) Then, there is a formula giving luminosity of a black body (a star can be approximated to a black body) depending on its temperature and the distance from it, it is called The Stefan–Boltzmann equation , . We just reverse the equation to get the radius : . Finally, with the data of Pistol Star, we just have to calculate. L☉. = 2.105e+14 m = 2.105e+11 km = 1337 A.U. Less than 100 A.U. different ! (Yep 80 light-minutes is not that far :P) But once again I really don't know if my second reasoning is well done. 

I am trying to establish a "planet viability scale" which can give a score (say from 0 to 20) reflecting the chances of a planet to be suitable for life. More precisely the potential of evolution of a life-form if I drop a microorganism on the planet. For example : 

Now, by putting your examples in those category I think you can see the objectives of an AI, and place them on a success scale. And even if the think/act barrier is thin, the human/rational one is huge. You don't want your self-driving car to stop because it is afraid of the dark (like a human could be) and you don't want your robot assistant to bring you a saw when you say you want to "cut some corners". 

Basically you just make an inverted siege, you avoid it to go to the planet until it runs out of energy. You could also just stay in orbit and hope that the crew on the B227, by seeing their planet (and family ?) threatened by you, make a mutiny, or surrender, or try a desperate maneuver. Ultimatum in the stalemate Another way of doing this (less ethically correct but less evil than Mormacil's answer :P) is to force the psychological failure in the B227. As you are taking some places on Berusslow-4c, make sure you are seen by a lot of people. The population on the planet needs to know that they are in war. Thus, a part of the civilization will try to escape this war, and take spaceships to go to another planet or even to go to another stellar system. Offer them an ultimatum, they surrender or you shoot those rescue ships. You will be considered as evil, but if they are reasonable (sentimental ?) they will surrender or psychologically collapse. Once B227 is out of the game, the rest should be a piece of cake. 

Thus, what is the minimum radius of a circular corridor for the walls to appear straight ? The inside of the corridor is in the dark, the character (human) sees around her in a radius of 20 meters thanks to her fire torch. She has to think that the walls are straight because of both her vision and her touch if she touch the wall. Thus, she thinks it is a very very long corridor, but in fact she is walking in circle ! The corridor width $R - r$ is about 2 meters.
