The process of mummification would have to be significantly different from what it has been historically, as mentioned by the other posters and commenters. Most importantly, it would probably have to start with a living person, rather than a days old corpse. We want the cells 'frozen' so to speak, waiting to be restarted, rather than literally dead as in a traditional corpse. The purpose of the original mummies was eternal life. If you think about it this way, the mummification process resembles nothing better than cryogenics today. In cryogenics, a freshly dead body (or just head) is quickly cooled down to a very very low temperature. The goal of the operation is to prevent further decay. Unfortunately, current means of cooling bodies are destructive, in that ice crystals form that destroy cell membranes and make functionality at reheating essentially impossible. So. How would a revivable mummy look like? I think the more important question is about its coffin. It would be a high-tech device (well, i suppose large granite slabs were high-tech 4000 years ago) that would maintain a constant (probably low) temperature. The body inside would have undergone the process while (barely) alive. Since we wish to restore consciousness, presumably we don't want to grab the brains out through the nose like the Egyptians did. If done very very carefully, we might be able to gradually thaw out the person days, months, years, or even centuries later. There are examples of (much simpler) organisms in nature that can revive after freezing, so the idea is not completely insane. Even so, revival in the (same) flesh might be out of the question. More likely, future technology would be used to generate a digital upload, and even more advance handwaving would be needed to reincarnate that mind. 

They don't have the supply-chains The weaponry that a high-end technological society is likely to use is of an incredibly sophisticated nature. This requires the efforts of vast segments of society to produce and maintain, from the coffee the tank-driver drinks to the roads it drives on, to the spare-parts it needs, the ammunition, the refineries that produce the fuel, the oil-rigs that generate the oil for the refineries, the mines that mine the ores for the armor, etc. It takes literally millions of people to produce and maintain in operation a single tank. When the supply chains collapse, so does the technology that depended on them. Simply having some two-bit solar generator or whatever special technology the super-special people have won't be enough of an industrial infrastructure base. Simply having the tank blueprints is about as much help for war in your circumstances as an equal quantity of paper in light-romance novels. Rusty Even if they inherited a vast amount of pre-built weaponry from the pre-apocalyptic world, without the infrastructure to maintain it, the tank treads might have rusted, the fuel might have leaked, the bullets corroded and rusted over the decades in the moist environment, etc. 

Even with your miraculously compatible aliens, female embryos are viable, whereas male ones are simply not. 

Unlikely to ever happen. By colonizing the entire planet, we will likely drive into extinction or zoos all other large mammals that could possibly compete against us. With 2.7 trillion people, you'd be in no risk of being numerically overwhelmed anytime soon. The only threats to such a megalopolis would be internal strife upsetting the complex networks required to keep each portion of it alive and thriving. 

Why is everyone always over-complicating things? Step 1) Use a regular room, with a normal, possibly unlocked door. Step 2) Sever the evil wizard's Achilles tendons. 

Granite is one of the most durable types of rock. As you walk across a granite staircase, the electromagnetic fields in your shoes are repelled by the electrons in the outer layers of the outermost atoms in the granite slab. Occasionally, a few granite atoms are kicked loose in the interactions. Over the centuries, this builds the grooves you see in old palace staircases. Same thing happens with every drop of rain that lands on the Machu Picchu, every gust of wind that brushes against the Pyramids of Giza. The point is, 10 million years is a very, very long time. It is about 2000 times longer than the Pyramids of Giza have been in existence, and about 100 times longer than biologically modern humans have lived on this planet. Furthermore, the pyramids were mostly a solid set of blocks with little inner structure, definitely not meant to be lived in, and located in a dry inhospitable area. They have not aged gracefully: 

It is very much a function of the state of the planet on arrival, how ample a power supply you have to start and the degree to which your robots are capable of advanced nanotechnology. I'll assume you have both water-based oceans in your world and artificial controlled nanotech, it'd be a rather hopeless endeavor without (relying on biological nanotech, aka microbes, would take hundreds of thousands to millions of years). 

Now this dialect was made specifically to be difficult to grok by outsiders. Since you don't want your readers totally lost, you may want to introduce them more gradually to the dialect, perhaps through the eyes of some outsider interacting with someone who straddles both worlds. 

Hrimfaxi Official Operational Report on Sol-III, Stardate 12345.6667 Mission Accomplished! The entire world is ours: 

Careful ecological management could greatly shrink the Sahara even without massive irrigation work. With fusion or near-zero cost solar, it's quite likely that more and more of the wastelands of Earth will be reclaimed. It would likely not be massive and wasteful open lakes, but subterranean irrigation micro-arrays going straight to the roots of cultivated plants (better known as Drip Irrigation). There will be those who will moan and decry the loss of habitat for some desert spider or spiny shrub, but most likely the Chadians and Nigeriens will be too busy growing out their gardens to care. 

Keep it simple: The great table had only 10 seats. 9 of the seats had a glittering actuated paining behind it, representative of their Guild's Arms. 

Of course, since Sister-Mars is double the radius of actual Mars, it would be double the size. Needless to say, you would not be seeing cities, or even mountains. However, you would see a blue and white jewel sitting in the dark sky. Thus, the existence of oceans and ice-caps might be quite easily resolved. Galileo's first book, the Sidereus Nuncius, would likely be about Sister-Mars and its oceans rather than Jupiter's moons. Oceans! On Mars! 20 editions would burn off the printing presses before the year is out. An enthusiastic Prince Maurits of the Netherlands offers a 2000 florins prize for an improved glass for the new farseeing telescopes, triggering an optics revolution. A jewish glassmaker in Amsterdam claims the prize, and mountains and vegetation cycles are soon noted for Sister-Mars. A Spanish writer publishes a best-seller by the name of "The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha on Mars", where he depicts the hidalgo getting caught up in air vortices and dragged to Mars. By the end of the 17th century giant 300x telescopes are being built, and a thriving literary genre imagines various utopias and dystopias on Mars, inspiring generations of young budding scientists to dream the impossible. Disastrous attempts to launch projectiles "toward Mars" are conducted over and over again. The intense attention to astronomy, and the craze among the nobility about court astronomers results in the laws of celestial mechanics being discovered a century early, triggering an early scientific revolution in Europe. A Dutch lensmaker by the name of Baruch Spinoza invents what we know as the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation, but means of propulsion into orbit remain beyond the era's technology. A young Isaac Newton invents calculus and focuses on optics in an attempt to improve telescope resolution, discovering spectral lines in the process. Blaise Pascal devises means of calculating atmospheric interference with the telescopes, discovering many of the gas laws and pertinent information about atmospheric composition in the process, including many useful properties of steam. Railway lines crisscross Europe by the mid-1700s, and a full blown industrial revolution is soon underway. By the early 1800s, Prussian artillery is finely crafted enough to launch projectiles on suborbital paths. Radio is discovered, and within 30 years, anomalous signals are detected coming from Mars. Carl August von Steinheil is the first to realize these were the product of another civilization. 

Induced Hemianopsia and visual neglect Easy. The beast is not actually invisible, it's generating a very precisely pulsed directed-gradient magnetic field. The magnetic field it can generate has a limited range, hence the trouble it has with long distance invisibility, but when you're within range, the field interferes with precisely the correct portion of your brain, causing a phenomenon similar to hemianopsia, whereby the subject loses awareness of the existence of part of their visual field, where the inability of a person to process and perceive stimuli is not due to a lack of sensation. To give you a vivid example, presented with a circle and asked to label it correctly with the hours of the clock on it, a person with right hemispheric hemianopsia would draw something like this: 

Step 1: Build a template library Well, this part might be a tad morally controversial, since it basically involves taking a few hundred soldiers and ... uh... slicing them up into really thin, 10nm wide slices. Obviously this presents interesting technical challenges, including non-destructive tissue vitrification (forgot to mention, you gotta turn your soldiers to glass first), nanometer resolution scanning and feature resolution across the slices. Basically you have to figure out how to freeze a human into a glassy substrate mid-breath and then scan them and reassemble the giant 3-D jigsaw puzzle into a meaningful whole again. This is, needless to say, many orders of magnitude beyond our current computational and matter-control capabilities, but nothing (besides maybe the near-instant non-destructive vitrification bit) is physically impossible. Once these few near-impossible steps have been achieved, you have your template library. At first you'll want to rebuild exact clones, but as the cost per build decreases (practical, hands-on experience with doing stuff almost always brings the per unit cost down), your engineers can start playing around with chimeras, combining the best features extracted from across specimens. Step 2: Full in-silico instantiation Build an in-silico model of the complete build. With realistic physics and some significant supercomputing muscle, a "build" could be tested in virtual reality for seconds (or if the funding is particularly generous maybe even weeks or months) before it is judged fit for a fleshbuild. This is particularly used for testing blended builds, or daring tweaks to an existing model. Particular parameters can be altered (let's up aggro to 17/25, and test if it can still obey orders, or just going on bloody indiscriminate rampages). Depending on the battlefield purpose, certain features that would prove lethal in days or socially undesirable in human soldiers that would have to function in a society could be baked into the vatgrown. Think replacing the digestive system with a glycogen store, if the specimen has an expected lifetime measured in days. Step 3: Good old-fashioned 3D printing Again, depending on the per-unit cost and the expected durability, certain shortcuts and digital workarounds can be made. If the per unit cost is in the tens of millions of dollars and durability in years, you can build many redundant systems (2 hearts, advanced stop-bleed tech, etc), whereas if the cost can be brought down to roughly the current price to produce a calf in the West (about $1000) and the expected life-time is in days or hours, you can skip many life-maintenance systems that would be needed in a longer-lived or more valuable specimen (I already mentioned replacing the digestive system with an energy storage as a possible example). The most complex parts will probably be the wiring diagrams of the brains. Human neurons usually take years or even decades to wire themselves into a useful network, with slow dendritic and axonic growth and pruning of synaptic connections. Presumably, with proper chemical prodding the neurons can be coaxed into linking much faster and along predetermined paths. The amount of information stored in this will be truly enormous. The human wiring diagram relies on a few tens of megabytes stored in DNA (nowhere near enough to specify the cross-wiring of billions of neurons), and makes up the rest with chaotic growth followed by aggressive pruning. Presumably, your builders can rely on a version of this on metaphorical steroids. Explosive dendritic growth followed by ruthless pruning. Nanomachinery, directed microwave activity, lasers ... there are many options here. Alternatively, you can skip the whole wetbrain and go for bionic options, with in-silico (computer)-ran versions, which may often be faster and more capable than the biological versions. 

Caveat: Why such a scenario is highly unlikely The process of evolution works by selecting on the results of random variation from established forms, whereby the phenotype is exposed to the particulars of a time-space environment and successful reproduction in that environment allows the perpetuation of the genes in that genotype, even though the individual organism is generally not repeated. Reproductive success is therefore the product of numerous random mutagenic factors, as well as subject to exogenous shocks such as equilibrium-altering events (invasive species, climate fluctuations, massive ice ages, continent-wide volcanic eruptions and even massive space-origin impacts such as the one that is assumed to have killed off the dinosaurs). Now imagine you have the extraordinary fortune to have not one but two Gigayear-habitable goldilocks-range worlds in the same system. By the established mechanism of asteroid exchange, life would most likely successfully spread to both worlds. So far so good. But from here on, life is set to diverge wildly. Even if the two worlds are similar as raindrops, there's a good chance you'll end up with trilobites or dinosaurs dominating on one world and mammals on another, since as far as we understand, many of the extinction events drastically altered global ecosystem balance, by literally wiping out the competition. The situation you describe would indeed be every xenobiologist's fantasy: how much convergent evolution does take place, and how much is dictated by random factors? Were dinosaurs doomed by their tiny brains, or would mammals have forever been stuck at the terrified night rodent stage if not for the Chicxulub event? Ask yourself: What are the odds of two essentially independent planets happening to develop intelligent life at exactly the same time? Moreover, since humanity spent its first 100,000 years as hunter-gatherers, what are the odds the two independent sentient species would then proceed to develop agriculture at the same time? Yet more coincidentally, they also develop the scientific method within decades of each other. Far more likely that one would reach space tech while the other world has no sapiens-level intelligent life at all, or at the very least, while the other is stuck in its long hunter-gatherer dawn of civilization stage. This can all be waved away with sufficient amounts of alien-ex-machina, who choose to come back every few million years and direct the evolution of life on both worlds, even transplanting individual genes, or perhaps full genotypes or phenotypes (that further their incredibly long term plans) from one world to the other. So I'll go ahead and assume that happened. 

These weapons were initially developed by the Soviets, who developed man-portable versions such as the РПО-А Шмель and the ТОС-1 - тяжёлая огнемётная система missile launcher. These were used by the Russians to level Grozny in 1999. 

There would be (to start with) 7 billion human-descended species (since species are defined by cross-reproduction, and we're excluding that). Some lines would die out while others might thrive (and have lots of clones). Depending on the technology you use to generate and grow your clones, there would still be genetic drift. If chromosome recombination can occur, a fraction of the clones would suffer from lethal or debilitating genetic maladies. If your genetic-copy quality control function were about as efficient as our current system (1 error per million to 1 error per hundred million base pairs), and chromosome recombination did occur as part of whatever mitotic process replaces gametes meiosis, your clones would slowly descend into inbred imbeciles, probably too slowly for anyone to notice. PS: I just noticed Leushenko already covered some/most of this in his comment. If you wish to turn your comment into an answer, I'll delete mine.
