Although it is difficult to read the type on your slightly fuzzy picture, several details suggest that it's an enduro or downhill type Specialized: massive frame, fairly long front travel, big brake discs, rear triangle that allows big swings. Searching for Specialized and enduro produced a nice survey suggesting that it dates from 2005-2006. $URL$ 

I suggest to avoid Switserland, except for a small corner, because it is horribly expensive and boring. Stick as long as possible to Italy, my favorite biking country. I also suggest to do a couple of legendary passes that you could skip if you followed the line of least action, but that will give you lasting memories of the riding Italy's backcountry. Here is my recommended route, all done myself, but not in one season: Bormio - Grosio - Passo di Mortirolo - Edolo - Passo Aprica - Morbegno - Passo San Marco - Lenna - Passo San Pietro - Lecce - Como - Biella - Aosta - Col Grand Saint Bernard - Martigny - Col du Forclaz - Chamonix - Col des Aravis - Annecy. All in all 700 km and 14000 meter elevation gain. See $URL$ 

In small neighborhoods like this it's also not a bad idea to stay out in the lane and not hug the curb. This gives you much more time if a car or child comes hurtling out into the road and you're not going to be slowing down a following car very much. Edit: include the warning to watch for dogs. This is pretty important. 

I find Clif Bars to be a pretty good solution. They're easy to open, they go down relatively easily, they don't melt or freeze (ever try eating a powerbar on a cold day?) and they have about 200+ calories. On rides shorter than 3 hours, I just take a couple of packets of Gu, one bottle of water, and one bottle of lightly-mixed gatorade (I mix from powder since the full-strength stuff leaves the mouth quite sticky on a ride). On longer outings, I'll take the Gu and a Clif Bar per 2 hours, and lots more water. 

If you look down at your front hub while riding, you want it to be somewhere in the vicinity of being hidden by your handlebar. For a commuter bike, you want to be able to look forward (with your head more or less erect) without feeling like you're craning your neck. In said upright-head position, you shouldn't have to stretch for your handlebar. Your seat should be at a height such that your leg is mostly extended at the bottom of the pedal stroke, but you should not have to rock your hips at all during the bottom of the pedal stroke. Your seat should be situated fore/aft such that you can do the following: a. Tie a weight on the end of a string. b. Hold the non-weighted end of the string in the slight hollow on the outside front of your knee. c. The string should fall close to the spindle of your pedal when that pedal is at the front of the stroke (3 or 9 o'clock, depending on how you look at it) 

Max 32T here refers to the largest rear sprocket, not the total capacity. So with an 11-28 you'll have no problem. 

I had a pair of stock tires that had the same issue. Unless I physically held the bead in place during inflation, there would be parts just like in the video, where the bead was getting sucked into the rim. It was ridable, but I could feel the dip every revolution. I couldn't find a solution by fiddling with inner tubes and rim tape, but replacing the tires with some higher quality ones totally solved the issue. If it's in your budget I would just replace the tires, better quality ones can make a big difference in ride quality, too. 

Very cheap tires are likely to have little or no puncture protection. Unless you're riding under very optimal conditions, slightly higher quality tires are worth it when you consider the time/cost of replacing or patching punctured inner tubes. 

If 17mm is the internal width, 21mm tires are probably a bad idea. According to Sheldon Browns (admittedly conservative) chart, 25mm is the lowest recomended width on 17mm rims. You could also probably contact Bontrager and ask for this specific rim though. As an aside, I'm not totally sure why you'd want to use 21mm tires. Barely anyone makes them anymore, they're less comfortable and have higher rolling resistance. 

My fixed gear bike has brakes. And I wear a helmet when riding it. And I don't listen to my iPod while on the bike. I'm the new non-conformist. 

Don't expect much until you know the guys that work at a bike shop. I bought my first road bike (a single speed) from my not-so-local LBS because it was on sale (45 miles from my house, with several bike shops in between). In the process, I discovered that I got along well with the guys that work there. In return for our growing relationship, they started giving me pointers about maintenance, and discounts on accessories (computer, bar tape, etc). When I referred my father-in-law to them to get a bike (he's a doctor and doesn't have the same price constraints that I do) they gave him a pretty good deal because I sent him. I have no doubt that when I've saved my pennies enough to budget for a new bike I'll get as good a deal as they can offer me, without having to ask for a deal. Most bike shop employees and owners could make a lot more money doing something else, but own/work at a bike shop because they love cycling. I appreciated the desire to stretch your dollars as far as they'll go, but nobody is entitled to special deals without earning them. 

There is probably no damage. In wheel-building, one of the ways to relieve torsional stresses in the spokes is to lay the wheel flat on the ground, so that it rests on the hub. While you press the rim on the ground at the 6 o'clock position by your knees, you put all your upper weight via both arms on the rim at about the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. You feel the elastic deflection, which depending on spoke tension and number may be about 1 cm. The spokes on the de-stressed side are able to unwind the torsional stresses. You rotate the wheel in small steps on both sides. There is no damage to either rim or hub. Look how this process was cleverly implemented on a luxurious wheel truing stand (at about 2:10) 

There is a book written by Frank Berto titled The Dancing Chain - History and Development of the Derailleur Bicycle. The fourth edition was updated in 2012. On page 368-369 he discusses chain design and chain types. Apparently, the 1981 Sedisport chain was the first bushingless chain. Its main feature was that it shifted better than bush-roller chains and also better than the Shimano Uniglide introduced in 1976. At the time, I guess 5 gear sprockets were the rule. With increasing number of gears over time, the bushingless chain took over from that point. 

I really want to ride the Lotoja, from Logan, Utah to Jackson, Wyoming (206 miles). There's some beautiful scenery along that route (I've driven it several times) and enough up and down to make it really challenging. I also really want to ride the Salt to Saint, from Salt Lake City, Utah to St. George, Utah. Since it goes through my hometown and all... Also, some beautiful views along the route. 

You can also create semi-studded tires by wrapping zip-ties around the tire, with the lock in the same position the screws are shown in the illustrated answer. You'd need a bike with disk brakes for this to work. So for a road bike it would probably be slightly less than practical. 

I ride a single-speed (as opposed to fixed gear) because I like to be able to coast down a hill without worrying about spinning out, or hitting a pot-hole while frantically trying to keep up with my pedals. Don't get me wrong, I love riding fixed-gear, but for where I live it's just a little impractical to not be able to coast. I ride a single-speed (as opposed to a geared bike) for multiple reasons. A: It's all I could afford. If you only have $600, you'll get a lot more bike with a single-speed than a geared bike. Or rather, you'll get a lighter bike with better hubs/wheels/etc than for a $600 geared bike. Someday I'll have the money for a decent road bike (105/Rival or better) and will buy one. But for now, my single-speed is much lighter and sturdier than any $600 geared road bike I could have gotten. B: I enjoy the simplicity. Want to go faster? Pedal faster. C: I enjoy the workout. I live in Utah, where there are some pretty big hills/mountains. The only way to get to the top is to (as my dad used to say) hunker down and gut it out. There's something quite invigorating about knowing you conquered that hill with the power in your legs instead of the mechanical advantage of your gear ratio. D: Even on the freewheel side of my hub, my single-speed is quiet. No gears means that unless I'm coasting, my bike is nearly silent. 

For disc brake bikes specifically, you want to have them positioned in the way that makes them easiest to open without touching the discs. For the front this is easily achieved by putting the lever on the right (in whatever orientation you fancy), but you can also have it slightly in front of the fork on the rotor side (behind also works if it's not interfering w/ the caliper). In the rear, I find that just slightly below the chainstay works best for me, making it easy to brace against the chainstay for both opening and closing. 

Strava (Premium) can determine your speed using GPS data, although GPS can be less accurate than a dedicated sensor because it jumps around a bit. There's no magic way to determine cadence without a sensor, except maybe counting it in your head. 

The cantilevered dropouts date it from 1989 to 1996, the threadless headset to the later end of that. Based on a quick look through the catalogs here, it looks like a 1995 R700, their entry level triathlon/TT bike, which was sold that year with a polished aluminum frame and black fork. That's making the assumption that it wasn't converted to tri-bars later in it's life. It was had a 2x8 (16 speed) drivetrain, not 3x8 (24 speed), but looking at the picture it looks like you may have miscounted the speeds, I see a double not a triple. The brake levers also don't match, but that's an easy switch so they could be aftermarket. 

It will probably depend on terrain, speed, and other aerodynamic (or lack thereof) factors whether one would even notice a difference between an "aero" frame or a "normal" frame. If you're climbing lots of hills, riding in traffic, or otherwise not in a position where wind resistance is your chief enemy, I doubt you'd see a benefit from going aero. If you live out in the farmlands and ride on fast, flat roads, or somewhere that has lots of wind, you may notice a difference, because wind/air resistance becomes a factor. 

Lube your chain frequently. As in every time it rains if you need to. Depending on the drive-train, you can get Shimano or SRAM chains at places like Nashbar or Performance Bike, but even top-of-the-line, expensive chains will get rusty if they're out in the rain all the time. The same will hold with a Brooks saddle. No matter how awesome it is, if it's exposed to poor conditions without proper maintenance, it will deteriorate quickly. So lube your chain frequently, and dry it off whenever you get a chance before storing it. Disclaimer: If you go riding around with tons of lube on your chain in dry, dusty conditions, you'll pick up lots of dirt in your drivetrain.
