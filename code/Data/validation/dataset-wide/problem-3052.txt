One point to consider... while the US did develop quite a few AA missiles during the Cold War: Bomarc, Ajax, Hawk, etc... they never got much publicity because they weren't used. The Soviet SAM-2 became famous because it was actually used a lot... to shoot down a U2 (over their territory), in Vietnam, and in Egypt and Syria during the 1973 Yom Kippur war. What is remembered about the US and AA missiles during that time, is the countermeasures they developed: Radar jammers, missiles that homed in on SAM radar (HARM: high speed anti radar), units trained to destroy SAMs (the Wild Weasels) and aircraft that could either outrun SAM's (the SR71) or aircraft that couldn't be found by SAM's (the F117 and B2). To date, only one US AA missile has ever received any degree of publicity: the Stinger, as supplied to the opposition forces in Afghanistan during the Soviet intervention there. That tells us quite a bit about who was on the offensive, and who was on the defensive, during that time. 

A major limiting factor on rate of acceleration of an oil fired steam ship is how quickly the boilers can be brought to full pressure. Large ships, such as battleships and aircraft carriers, have multiple boilers, and at cruising speed will only be operating some of them, as running all boilers at reduced heat is very inefficient. To achieve full power, all boilers have to be operating at their maximum pressure, and that means bringing cold boilers on line. This takes some time, as the boiler must be heated evenly and slowly, lest parts of it expand too quickly, which could result in a rupture, and a horrible death for anyone in the boiler room if that happens. Here is a simple description for bringing a water tube boiler online. Fire for five minutes, wait 15 minutes, repeat until steam comes out of the bleed line instead of air (this usually takes eight or nine cycles), then slowly step it up to full pressure by firing for 30 minutes, and then waiting ten minutes. The whole process can take three to four hours, though it can be rushed a bit if the alternative is sinking, albeit while placing the machinery room crew at some risk of being boiled alive if a steam line ruptures. If we assume the warship is operating under wartime conditions, and the crew has kept the inactive boilers at least partly heated in anticipation of a change of speed, all boilers could be brought online in around two to three hours. So, to begin with, the battleship captain must allow a minimum of two to three hours just to get enough steam pressure on all boilers to even contemplate high speed. And then there is the matter of accelerating a mass of 30,000+ tons in water, after all boilers have achieved operating pressure. This isn't as much of an issue with nuclear powered warships, as the heat is applied to the water in the boiler internally with a heating loop, not externally by first heating the boiler. The water itself acts as a thermal buffer for the boiler, so they can be heated more quickly without as much concern for uneven heating and thermal shock. The US navy has abandoned oil fired steam plants entirely, replaced with either nuclear plants or gas turbines. The gas turbines are much lower maintenance, and can be brought to full power in a matter of seconds. 

The heritage of the Samurai, the Bushido code, played a major role in how Japan conducted operations in WW2. The first effect was the 'no surrender' policy. The Japanese soldier fought to the death, almost to a man. In the end, the result was a senseless slaughter with no measurable goal. Roughly three million Japanese died during the war, as opposed to the half a million casualties the US suffered in both theaters. On Iwo Jima, the US took 17,000 casualties, around 6,000 dead. Japan suffered 22,000 casualties, with maybe 200 surviving as prisoners. By this point in the war, the banzai charges into heavily armed Marines had been abandoned as ineffective. Later in the war, Bushido was twisted to include Kamikaze attacks. That association of suicidal attacks with Bushido was not entirely true - Bushido stressed the 'fight another day' policy - a dead Samurai is not very useful. However, the proponents of Kamikaze overlooked that, and played up the self sacrifice aspects to convince impressionable young men to carry out the attacks with no hope of survival, or even victory. So it wasn't so much the Samurai tradition, but a twisting of it by the militarists, that led to Japan taking such high casualties during the war. 

Cavalry is far more mobile than the alternative of the time - foot soldiers. Yes, spears can be an effective counter to a calvary charge, but only if the cavalry chooses to charge into a spear armed formation. But, the cavalry can do something smart, like use its high mobility to attack from several directions, or attack a supply line or headquarters that is too far away for spear armed foot soldiers to reach in time to stop the attack. Spears are of no use against cavalry, if they are not where the cavalry is attacking, and can't be moved there in time to counter the attack. Many centuries later, when the spears became fortifications along an expected route of attack, and the cavalry became mechanized troops, aircraft, and armored vehicles, the effectiveness of mobility was demonstrated when Germany defeated France in six weeks, with a smaller force, by bypassing the fortifications and hitting the soft areas far quicker than the French thought they could. 

There are numerous interpretations, depending the outlook of the interpreter. The term 'well regulated militia' is probably the most puzzling to us today. One one hand, this could indicate the old British habit of drawing it's bowmen from the civilian population, that armed citizens would form the militia. During the revolutionary war, armed citizens played a role, including woodsmen with their very accurate (for it's day) long rifles, but not a large one. Most of the fighting was army on army, with the standard issue weapon being the Brown Bess, captured by the colonial armies from British stores. Irregular militias comprised of citizens with their own arms did exist, but weren't a deciding factor in the outcome of that conflict. Or, given that a war of revolution against the British had just been fought, with the initial actions being undertaken against the British militias by armed citizens, the preamble may indicate that citizens can keep and bear arms to give them the ability to oppose a militia. In other words, it was the militias that might need regulation by armed citizens. The context in which the 2nd amendment was written is not entirely clear. 

No, the wealthy French of Louis XIV, or the wealthy British, did not have much to do with industrialization, other than financing some of the efforts. Industrialization thrived, when the price of items normally considered luxuries, was lowered to the point where a large number of people could afford them. Less per item profit, but far more sales. It was the millions of potential customers: average people, and the prospect of doing what automated manufacturing does best: produce quantity at a lower price, that was the motivating force behind industrialization. Industrialization actually worked against the exclusivity of luxury items, by lowering the price to the point where they were no longer exclusive or extravagant. Example: The elaborate woven textile patterns of the 1700's were limited to a wealthy few, because such clothing was hand weaved by skilled weavers. One missed stitch could ruin months of work. The material needed for a single evening gown could take up to a year for a hand weaver to produce. The coming of the Jacquard loom, which automated those patterns with punch cards, cut the price of elaborate textile patterns dramatically. The woven silk material to produce that evening gown could now be produced in a couple of days, by a far less skilled person. Consequently, the price dropped to a point where the less than noble could now afford them. And... sadly for the wealthy, such elaborate clothing was no longer so exclusive. Industrialism wasn't propelled by the wealthy. It was motivated by the desire to provide the luxuries of the wealthy, at a price the far more numerous working people could afford, so that the industrialists could have a larger market and... more profit. In a curious reversal, it was the Dissenters in the UK who left London and moved north to escape the discrimination of the British upper crust that were to form the nucleus of the Industrial Revolution. Within a century, these outcasts became the British upper crust. Not by birthright or inheritance, but by the vast sums of money they made. 

Some of the UK colonies became independent on very friendly terms, and still maintain close ties to the UK. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand come to mind. However... their indigenous populations were pushed aside by the arriving colonists, so those people might feel otherwise about the experience. Hong Kong didn't move from colony to self rule, it moved from colony of one nation to becoming part of a more authoritarian nation, with no real input from the HK residents on the transition. 

The first submarine that was successful enough to warrant widespread adoption, changing the nature of naval warfare forever, was built by John Holland. His basic design is still in use today. There were underwater vessels built before Holland's design, but none were successful enough to warrant widespread adoption. Arguably, methods to travel underwater date back to the time of Alexander, who was recorded to have dove into the Med using an early diving bell. Holland benefited from two technical advancements that filled in the missing pieces: sustainable power under water (electric motors and batteries), and a safer (for the crew of the submarine) method of attack, the Whitehead torpedo. It is now believed that the crew of the CSS Hunley were killed or incapacitated by the underwater shock of the explosion, when the explosive charge detonated prematurely, with the Hunley still next to the USS Housatonic, so an effective military submarine really couldn't have been built before the self powered torpedo was available. 

It is human nature to equate larger than normal characters with volume. It is also human nature to equate an exclamation point with shouting, just as it is human nature to equate a question mark with confusion. Whether it is a tweet, or whether it is a passage in an old book, the association is the same. This is true? This is true! THIS IS TRUE!!!! (see what I mean?) Therefore, the association of all caps with shouting began with mixed case alphabets. It became prevalent with computers, as the need to go through editors and publishers to get one's written word out to the public was eliminated, and thus the safeguards for proper diction were also eliminated. 

This compendium of declarations of several southern states stating the reasons for breaking away, specifically mention slavery, and the anti-slavery efforts of the northern states as a primary reason for breaking away. This didn't happen overnight... slavery had been a contentious issue for some time, producing among other things the Mason-Dixon line. To add perspective, this wasn't so much a matter of good and evil, more that the agrarian south relied heavily on slave labor while the industrial north had learned that slaves don't do very well in the more complex industrial jobs prevalent in the northeast US. The north could easily take a 'virtuous' stand because it wasn't giving up anything in the process. Another factor: tariffs put in place by the federal government to protect the emerging northern industry by curtailing manufactured goods import from Europe brought down retaliatory tariffs by Europe, which reduced the primary export of the US: agricultural goods like cotton, which came from the southern states. Nor did the north invade the south with the explicit goal of abolishing slavery. So, while the slavery debate was the most visible symbol of differences, the economic inequity visited on the agriculture of the south to benefit the industry of the north was also a motivating factor. Figuring out if there was any great degree of virtue on the part of the 1860's federal government is a bit more difficult. No less than Abraham Lincoln, while president, proposed plans to remove the former slaves from the US, and relocate them, either to British Guyana (Belize), or back to Africa. His untimely death put an end to that idea, despite some contemporary articles that publish unsourced and uncredited accounts that Lincoln had changed his mind on this plan. There was an effort to send Africans back to Africa: the nation of Liberia was created in the 1800's, and populated with former slaves sent back to Africa. So it would appear that while the north didn't want slavery, they weren't exactly in favor of the former slaves living among them. In fact, discrimination against Africans by the federal government didn't see any great curtailment until the 1950's. WW2 was fought by segregated troops with blacks relegated to service posts: construction, truck driving, cook, with the general (and incorrect) belief that blacks weren't good combat soldiers. Similar military segregation was not visited upon other ethnic groups. And this sudden outburst of 'virtue' didn't stop the same federal government from committing genocide against native tribes in the west, or exploiting the Chinese and killing quite a few of them, while building the railroads. Both of those events happened in in the late 1800's. Viewed from the perspective of the time, the 'virtue' looks more like a matter of convenience, because it was not accompanied by any sacrifice on the part of the north, nor were the ostensibly high morals championed as the source of the anti slavery efforts evident in how the north treated other minorities, or even how they treated the Africans after the war. 

A few relevant factors: The Roman alphabet of Gutenberg's time had around 32 characters, plus ten digits and ten to fifteen commonly used punctuation marks and other symbols. Written Chinese has over 500 commonly used symbols, many of those being combinations of other symbols within the same block... far more difficult to reproduce for printed pages. To a degree, Gutenberg was successful because the alphabet he was working with was more conducive to moveable type printing. Gutenberg was a goldsmith, accustomed to working with metals. It wasn't just the moveable type, but the molds he came up with to make new letters to be printed with, that made his system work so well. Pour hot lead into the mold, and in a few seconds, you have a new printable character. Chinese blocks were either hand carved wood or porcelain, taking far longer to make. Anyone could learn to work Gutenberg's molds quickly, while a skilled carver was needed to make the hand carved blocks. For printing a page, you need more than one of each character, you need lots of each character, so the ease and simplicity of reproducing moveable print elements was a major factor in the success of Gutenberg's press. Europe of Gutenberg's time was a period of dramatic change in both technology and society. This probably magnified the impact of the printing press. China of that period and before had a more regimented/caste society, so automating the flow of new ideas wasn't nearly as beneficial... there weren't as many new ideas to print. This was the same rough time period and location that Copernicus was challenging the centuries old Aristotle solar model that the catholic church rigidly adhered to (and locked Galileo up for contradicting), and Martin Luther was challenging the centuries old authority of the catholic church... aided by an early Gutenberg press. So, to an indeterminate degree, Europe of the 1500's was in a better position to benefit from automating the flow of new ideas. 

One other reason for the disappearing gas station is - vehicles have become far more reliable, and far less demanding of routine maintenance. Most of those mom and pop stations made their real money on maintenance and repair. Which is why they've been replaced by mini-markets. Even into the early 70's, tires would last maybe 20k miles, and were far more prone to punctures. The onset of radial tires plus increased content of carbon black in tires now gives them upwards of 80k mile life, and it's extremely rare to get a flat any more, so much so that the full size spare tire in a car is now quite rare. Spark plugs used to last maybe 10k miles. Thanks to unleaded fuel, they now last over 100k miles. Same with brakes... 20k-30k miles used to mean a complete brake overhaul. Today... 100k on the original brakes is not uncommon. Electronic ignitions eliminate another high maintenance point of pre 1980's cars: points and condensers. For that matter, cars themselves tend to last longer. A pre-1970 car, at 100k miles, was expected to be in need of an engine overhaul. The interval was shorter for air cooled engines like the VW Beetle. Today, the better cars can go over 200k miles with no major engine work. The one maintenance issue that's still regular is oil changes, which is why we see instant oil change outlets everywhere.
