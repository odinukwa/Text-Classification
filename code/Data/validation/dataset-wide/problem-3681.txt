Maybe a little. Creatine will assist in ATP (adenosine triphosphate) turnover from ADP (adenosine diphosphate). This could help with recovery between sets, maybe a some extra strength available before a muscle fatigues. I don't think it's going to do much for your general energy levels. If anything would help when you feel low on energy during workouts, it would be carbohydrates. These provide the glucose needed by muscles for force production. Protein is required for building muscle and can also provide energy, but when it comes to energy levels during a workout session you'll find glucose levels have a much more profound effect, and carbs are simply the easiest and most direct source. I leave you with some further notes. The relation between dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol levels has come under scrutiny. Dietary cholesterol used to be thought of as the primary driver for blood levels for a long time but that stance is being re-examined (and outright rejected in some cases). So it's possible that leaving out the eggs isn't really helping you. There's been a lot of flipping on the cholesterol issue with new surprises springing up every so often. Cholesterol used to be bad. Then it was found there's HDL and LDL with the latter requiring reduction and the former actually needing to be higher for some folks. Meanwhile the idea that dietary fat is a big problem came under scrutiny. Then it was said saturated fats were the problem while unsaturated fats were actually beneficial. The blame for the obesity epidemic shifted towards carbohydrates. But only refined carbohydrates. Then red meat was discovered to give you bowel cancer. Must be the saturated fat. Oh wait, no, saturated fat actually isn't the problem, we're thinking it must be the carnitine now. And then there's controversy over statins regarding whether they're actually needed at all, if their benefits outweigh the risks and if the cholesterol scare isn't even an artificial problem in the first place. You see where I'm getting at? Each piece of the puzzle brings 5 other pieces out of alignment. Doctors can't be expected to be completely up-to-date with all the latest nutritional studies, and even if they are they can only operate on the current state of knowledge. Which is also what doctors did 20 years ago when they told you to eat less fat, and a couple centuries ago when mercury was the magic cure-all. So with that in mind, how do you expect a trainer to know much better? With all due respect to some of the good trainers out there, most PT's don't know sh*t. All I can say is, learn as much as you can from the information out there, be skeptic of everything (broscience and actual science alike) and find out what works for you. Long story short, protein supplements probably won't do much for your cholesterol level, creatine is useful but no miracle supplement (it's actually quite subtle) and some carbs would help you with that workout energy. Don't panic if increasing carbs leads to some quick weight gain, that'd be water retention from the glucose/glycogen. 

There's nothing in particular regarding the timing of your protein consumption that will make any significant difference according to our current understanding. Keep in mind however, that some people experience minor gastric distress from whey protein and this could interfere with training. (Farts. I'm talking about farts.) 

Considering you have not trained for 6 months, and you state you've lost "practically all your muscle", I think you should consider yourself a beginner again. There are many workout plans out there suitable for beginners. The ones that work well are those which keep certain aspects of the novice trainee in mind: 

Let's take a look at the three nuts mentioned (peanuts, cashews, almonds) on Nutritiondata to see what looks interesting. Peanuts. 100 grams amounts to 567 Kcal. 49 grams fat, of which only 7 grams saturated. 16 grams carbohydrates of which 8 grams fiber and 4 grams sugar. A nice 26 grams protein. Peanuts have an outstanding amino acid profile making them an excellent protein source. Of the fat content, most of it is mono-unsaturated and a good deal poly-unsaturated. However, note that in 100 grams there's a whopping 15 grams of omega-6 fatty acids, yet only 3 mg of omega-3 fatty acids. Regarding vitamins you'll get a good dose of vitamin E, thiamin, niacin and folate; this is all pretty good. Regarding minerals there's good amounts of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc copper and a hefty dose of manganese. All of this is pretty nice too, and would be especially welcome if you'd happen to combine your diet with weight training. Onto cashews. 100 grams gives you 553 Kcal. 44 grams of fat, of which 8 saturated, 18 grams of protein (lower than peanuts) and a much higher carb content at 33 grams. Outstanding protein quality. 7.8 grams of omega-6 but only 62 mg of omega-3. A different vitamin profile from peanuts: high in vitamin K, thiamin and B6. Again good to have. As for minerals, you'll get iron, a lot of magnesium, good deal of phosphorus, some potassium, good deal of zinc, more copper than you need, nearly all the manganese you require in a day and some of the rare selenium. Finally almonds. 575 Kcal per 100 gram serving. 49 grams of fat, of which only 4 saturated. 22 grams of carbohydrate (in between cashews and peanuts). 21 grams of protein. Nice amount of dietary fiber (12 grams of the 22 grams carbs). Great protein quality but less so than peanuts and cashews. 12 grams of omega-6 versus only 6 mg of omega-3. A lot of vitamin E and much riboflavin (good thing to have). A really nice overall mineral profile, with the important minerals all well represented and some spikes in magnesium, phosphorus, copper and manganese. Nutritionally nuts and legumes are great food sources that tend to be under-represented in western diets. The balance of mostly unsaturated fats, carbohydrates and protein makes them great food to add onto a regular diet. Also packing a good deal of vitamins and minerals, they are a great choice of snack provided you don't get too excessive with sodium intake (salted varieties). So onto the negatives. In some cases an excess of vitamins can be detrimental. Regarding the vitamins found in the above nuts I don't think you should worry about this, and not in the amounts found in them. Some values exceed the daily recommended intake but there's no reason to think anything is gonna exceed a daily upper limit. As for minerals, most of it is pretty useful and again doubtful you're gonna get a dangerous excess of anything. For example, you'd have to go through heroic amounts of cashews to get too much selenium. The one thing that doesn't look so good is the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio. Nuts are very high in omega-6 while giving you very little omega-3. Since the ratio of these two fatty acids is important and omega-6 already tends to be dominant in a western diet you might want to pay attention to that. A fish oil supplement could be useful, unless you already regularly eat good sources of omega-3 such as fatty fish. Finally there's another matter, namely that of phytoestrogens. Particularly the type known as lignans tend to be high in nuts and seeds. These are compounds that can affect your hormonal system, either by activating or blocking receptor sites. Undesirable for men, possibly beneficial for women. However, the effects in humans are not well established, perhaps somewhat controversial and the fear of these possibly greatly overstated. Studies haven't really shown significant effects thus far. To be honest, I have the feeling that some folks, particularly those in the bodybuilding community, are focusing on things such as avoiding soy for absolutely minor effects while doing their bodies much graver injustices by other means. I wouldn't worry too much about it if I were you. So in conclusion, not only would the nuts you mentioned be a convenient source of calories (and lots of them) but also a very healthy one. The main thing requiring some attention is to keep that omega-6 to omega-3 balance in check, introducing some additional omega-3 to the diet. Finally, apart from nuts, you may also want to consider (whole) milk. If you could happen to find good quality milk obtained from pastured cattle, feeding on grass instead of grains, that'd be perfect. Grass-fed cattle produces milk and meat that has a much better omega-3/6 ratio than grain-fed cattle. Which is logical, because grass is what happens to be cows' natural source of food. The same goes for butter. 

So, you can get somewhere if you get 2 dumbbells with a bunch of plates, a pull-up bar and a dip belt. However, how far this will take you depends quite a bit on what your goals are and your personal stats. An older trainee looking for some exercise might not need weights beyond what dumbbells offer, but someone looking to gain quite a bit of strength and/or muscle mass is going to need more. I think you're better served checking out a gym with good equipment where you have an option to quit membership whenever you want. It'll give you an idea of how far you want to take this and how motivated you are. If you do decide to pursue strength at home, a home gym is certainly an investment but doesn't have to break the bank or turn into a huge garage gym. A quality power rack, good barbell, bunch of weight plates and a flat bench will pretty much have you set for doing all the most important, fundamental exercises. As for resources, I suggest you choose exercises you find fitting in each of the categories (horizontal/vertical push, horizontal/vertical pull, legs) and just consult the wealth of videos and texts out there on the web. The StrongLifts 5x5 website has pretty good descriptions for proper form on a bunch of fundamentals, with pictures. As for the "body science" method itself, I don't know it, but starting off with the major compound movements is a solid principle. I am wary of its "in less than 13 minutes per week" claims, though, because to be honest that is bull. For aerobic conditioning, it's probably best to pose that as a separate question. 

There's this idea in hypertrophy training that rest periods should be kept short to keep metabolic stress on the muscles high, and that this will be conducive to growth. Taking your example, suppose you want to focus on triceps. You could do benches to get both triceps and chest work, then superset with triceps extensions which isolate the triceps. The chest gets some rest between bench sets while the stress is kept high and recovery lower for the triceps. However, there's plenty of studies where all sorts of variables like numbers of sets, numbers of reps within sets and rest times are compared with regards to strength gains and hypertrophy. And it would seem that rest times don't have much of an impact. Far less than intensity and total volume, at any rate. Here's a meta-study looking at a variety of sources with that subject: $URL$ (The effect of inter-set rest intervals on resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy, Henselmans M, Schoenfeld BJ, Sports Med. 2014 Dec, 44(12):1635-43). It concludes that there's no evidence of shorter rest intervals providing superior muscle growth and in fact found one study where shorter rest had an adverse effect. The full text is behind a pay wall, but some conclusions (as well as other studies) are referenced here: $URL$ Hard to say if supersets do in some other way increase metabolic stress or have other effects that would influence hypertrophy. With a lack of evidence of rest intervals being that important (and actually indications that more rest might be better, because it's likely more total volume can be accumulated), I can't think of anything that would make them superior to doing the exercises in sequence where the same muscle groups are concerned. Unless specific muscles catch a break on one exercise as in the bench/extension example (the chest). I actually tend to use supersets for the exact opposite: to make better use of my time while letting muscle groups rest long enough between sets. To that end I superset antagonist muscles. For example, bench presses alternated with rows, or overhead presses with pull-ups. While resting from a set of one exercise, I do the other. Because the movements use complementary muscles the fatigue doesn't carry over much, meaning I get long rest times between sets while actually doing something in those. It can cut quite a bit of time from the workout total. It's also a small boost for burning energy when you're cutting because you're keeping the heart rate higher compared to complete rest.
