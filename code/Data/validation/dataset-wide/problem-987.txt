Happened to come across a very fair list at the National Hurricane Center website giving the details of the models and ensembles they employ operationally. Had seen the basic list of what the models are many other places, basically almost anywhere the A-deck "spaghetti models" are shown... but not giving the details on topics like data assimilation/resolution/ensemble methods/cycles, which much better answer some of my question. It's not perfect, both because it lacks a few of the requested details, and also because it excludes models like the NAM, HRRR, and FIM that aren't particularly applied in TC situations... but it's far better than anything I've ever come across! 

(Argo Website) It looks pretty comprehensive near the surface! Still, there's often hundreds of miles between sites, so while it means we have\do cover a fair bit of the area (more than 5%!), we aren't everywhere at once. And it's important to note that a a significant part of thermohaline circulations are near the surface, generally the red areas on this map: [ (Wikipedia) But the big thing to take home is that even where we don't have as much data, we can see the large thermohaline circulations well because of its scale and relative continuity. It's quite comparable to the upper atmosphere, where we also don't get data on large parts of the upper atmosphere, but can rather well diagnose jet stream fluctuations. Here's the upper air sounding network: 

One thing that has stood out from our past hurricanes in central Florida and also from watching those around the country is the real large propensity for folks to board up windows. But it has also seemed, at least with our limited experience (with fairly weak hurricanes overall), that there was rather minimal breakage of windows left unprotected. Certainly it's a complicated relationship, and things like debris quantity and exposure vary greatly. But nonetheless, I wonder if anyone has taken any basic statistics. Even those could greatly help in focusing preparation messages; saying "you're about X times more likely to have a window break at XXX mph versus XXX mph" would be quite useful, as would "only X% of windows break during a category 1 hurricane". Certainly the stronger the wind, the more vital that windows endure, as any breakage could well undermine the structure at stronger wind speeds. But it'd just be great to be able to offer more informed statements if they exist! 

So, though intuitively, you might think the surface sensible heat flux at 6 hours would just be the sshf variable in the 6 hour file, it isn't. To get the best estimate of the flux, you'd need to calculate it as: $$\mathrm{\frac{fluxvar_{(this\;timestep)} - fluxvar_{(previous\;timestep)}}{timestep_{(in\;hours)}\cdot3600}}$$ So if you want to find the average flux between hours 3 and 6, you'd do: $$\mathrm{\frac{fluxvar_{(t=6hr)} - fluxvar_{(t=3hr)}}{3\cdot3600}}$$ A couple of questions that Vidhi asked about that may be worthwhile understanding to others: 

You can look into the trends in each storm type in the following set of graphs: TD/TS/HUR 50 years: early, mid, late, total TS/HUR 100 years: early, mid, late, total By strength full history: early, mid, late, total (Note these analyses don't include 19 unnamed TCs in 1967-69 where no intensity is given in HURDAT) 

Not only are fronts associated with (extratropical) lows, but by in large, fronts are extensions of those lows, as shown by the following hand analysis (from the US Storm Prediction Center): 

So looks like the mean 500 height in September for Wisconsin ranges from about 571-580 Dm, with a standard deviation of 36-42 Dm. These are mean pressures, not lows or highs, so already, not that far off your low. If (a big if) meteorological statistics are normally distributed, using this calculator, this would suggest a 560 Dm height would be in about the 29th-40th percentile, depending upon location. A little lower than usual, but apparently fairly typical. And just for good measure, looking back at the University of Wyoming, I was able to fairly quickly come upon: 

But, fairly counter-intuitively to many, meteorological models often, despite naming their variables as flux (such as sshf... surface sensible heat flux), actually store them as accumulations. This ECMWF whitepaper on archive data specifications explains: 

Second, falling rain also encourages downward air movement, due to friction. [++ see downdrafts ++] So not only is rain (that is almost always colder) coming down, but air (that is almost always colder) is coming down too. Furthermore, rain is cooling the air it is falling through, colder air sinks, so the downdraft is further enhanced. [++ Actually the air must be quite a bit cooler to sink on its own... see adiabatic warming ++] So this is a second fairly quick cooling process, as downdrafts occur within the lifecycle of a thunderstorm cell/complex. 

You are right that upper air soundings are typically only done twice a day, and even at quite a coarse observation spacing. And that upper air data is definitely very important in models. I'd suggest that, firstly, it's important to note that even a broad, very hazy picture aloft really helps a great deal at the surface. That can be seen in the quasigeostrophic omega equation. Basically the large-scale highs and lows and jet streaks drive much of the vertical air motion in the atmosphere. Plus there aren't quite as many complexities caused by terrain/ground cover/moisture/differential heating that the surface layer sees. So because the evolution of those large-scale features is pretty straightforward over the course of a day, the early morning's upper-level forecast is still quite reliable and helpful 6 hours later. But that said, smaller scale shortwaves and vorticity maxima are absolutely vital to weather forecasting too. And with smaller size and more transient nature, neglecting their changes over 6 hours is likely to really harm forecasts when it comes to critical subtle differences such as you'd see in a tornado outbreak or hurricane track. So indeed, how DO we recognize those changes? Well, we do have a second source that these days is probably at least as important as soundings, perhaps even moreso - satellite imagery. See for example this satellite page. You can turn on HDW-low, HDW-mid, HDW-high. As far as I understand it, the models are ingesting that information readily (and likewise cloud coverage, which are just as important). I believe some satellites also have vertical temperature sounders that are used more now as well. And third, we also have some other data sources that help. In certain parts of the world, we've got radars. I believe at least some of the better models these days are using that data... there's plenty of wind data to be had from velocities (though it would seem challenging to use/analyze it given things like range-folded velocities and the ambiguity of tangential winds see the intro to [this article]). Plus, I believe at least the ECMWF has had real success in ingesting ACARS... atmospheric data that are generally reported by all commercial aircraft. But... all that said, your point still has some real potency. Especially when we note that, when it comes to our best model, the ECMWF... it still only runs twice a day. Maybe other reasons drive the decision, but you'd think they still weigh how improved such forecasts are. So it seems fairly likely that they've determined that long-range forecasts don't improve much when they are still based heavily upon that older information. But then, I think everyone would agree that having hourly models available like the HRRR is very useful in important nowcasting situations, such as severe weather awareness. So maybe the overlooked small data changes are (counterintuitively?) more important to long-range forecasting than short-term. Definitely an interesting question you've raised! 

Well, let's start with a rough global map (from NCEP Reanalysis) of the average winds speeds (in meters per second): 

It starts by identifying days with good overlay of shear and surface-based instability. In the US we have the Storm Prediction Center that helps indicate such days looking at models. Generally the very earliest signs that get chaser's attention are a reasonable trough moving into regions with adequate moisture and warmth (sometimes a cut-off upper-level low works too). Then the day before and the morning of the event, final target regions get narrowed down further by looking at visible and water vapor imagery, upper level air maps, and surface weather data. Basically the focus is generally on surface features... fronts, low pressure centers, drylines, and outflow boundaries. Chasers will usually get into that region by early afternoon, as supercells and tornadoes are most common during the late afternoon and evening. Once in the target zone, chasers keep an eye on any available satellite imagery, surface weather data, and also to the skies, looking for initial storm developments and any adjustments that may need to be made to the target area. In many situations, clouds will start building up and perhaps pulsate in development, giving indication of favored areas long before the cap is broken and they develop into supercells. Once the storms get going, the interest become identifying the stronger and more isolated storms as they develop rotation, becoming supercells. In the northern hemisphere, the "business area" of a supercell is usually near the southern end, where a supercell will typically start to develop some sort of hooked shape, as all shown in this supercell image: 

Keep in mind that the jet stream is only going to add 100-200 mph in general. So that's only like 1/3 of the cruising speed of a large jet. Of course the benefits will show up in both in fuel usage (and the additional weight benefits of carrying less fuel) and in travel time (people like quicker flights, and you can run more flights in a year and/or pay crew less). So despite being a longer distance, if it cut enough time/energy it might just be worth it. And, well go figure, it turns out you weren't far off at all! Because there actually is a direct flight from San Francisco to Delhi. And it looks like they do exactly as you suggested! 

(Image modified from OKFirst, the education arm of the Oklahoma Mesonet program. See comments for modifications I made.) The thing is, there's only a few basic forces that drive wind formation... and in the lower atmosphere, it turns out that the pressure gradient force outweighs the others enough such that, on the large-scale, air always flows from higher pressure towards lower pressure. So if you put those two ideas together: 

from www.pivotalweather.com (Once again, only one model's long-range calculation, and not a reliable forecast. But... let's just say that won't bring tropical hurricane weather if it comes together!) Look closely and compare, and you should be able to see, both in the little black line segment symbols showing wind flow, and in my arrows drawn to show a more continual path (if I managed to draw the arrows well enough!), that the wind is flowing outwards some in the Australia picture... but in the US picture (which is showing heights up closer to 5 km [3 mi] above the ground), the wind is basically perfectly balanced, neither getting near or closer... which is also matched in the the western region which winds are "slaloming" between a low over NW Canada and a high nearer Seattle). [in case it causes confusion, remember highs/lows rotate the opposite direction in opposite hemispheres, so the high in Australia is clockwise, and the low in the US is clockwise] The upper-level forces directing the wind display what is called geostrophic wind balance. The low-level winds are called ageostrophic because the friction leads to imbalance. 

Seeing all these rock identification questions, got me wondering, is there no straightforward guided rock identification website? In Intro to Geology lab, I remember going through a bit of a process towards trying to identify different rocks. There are some pretty decent cloud sites/charts around these days, not just basic descriptions like here, here, and here, but great in-depth site like here, and and especially these step-by step guides like here and here. I know there are a lot more types and complexity to rocks than clouds, and clouds typing tends to be a little less useful (in part because the formation mechanisms are fairly non-distinct). I've slowly started to see apps to lead you through plant/creature identification increasing, which is great, but are there any places we can point people to do the same for rocks? 

To help answer that, I'll start with a look at the broader country (and by extension, world), which is primarily my answer from a similar question on Physics SE, slightly adapted: It's good to start with some foundation on what time of day lightning is most often seen. Here is a plot from Global electric circuit implications of combined aircraft storm electric current measurements and satellite-based diurnal lightning statistics (Mach, Blakeslee, Bateman: 2011) 

I've also came across a page of some old reports from the WMO that may offer a small bit of insight into what modelss are used around the world, and the WMO main weather page offers links to each country's meteorological office, where such data may well be found. For instance, it appears that Argentina's Servicio Meteorológico Nacional runs an ETA model for their region. 

It's been a while since I've thought about this... and every time it still does take some careful thinking through it all. But hopefully this can really help you get it put together! First: Yes the Earth rotates counterclockwise around the Pole... 

The SPC's changeover announcement webpage offers very useful information on the change, and is central to this answer...
