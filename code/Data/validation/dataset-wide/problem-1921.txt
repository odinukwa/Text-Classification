It entirely depends on the relationship between the recruiter and company, the contracts they have and whatever contract/agreement you have in place with the recruiter (if any). Normally the "cool off" period is 6 month to a year after last contact. YMMV. 

You never know - perhaps it is legitimate. Salary ranges do sometime go very wide... If this sounds too good to be true, the saying goes that it probably is. If you decide to go ahead, do so with both eyes open and look out for anything out of the ordinary (above and beyond the salary). Things you need to ask the recruitment agency involved: 

Yes, it is. First off, you may actually have better technical ability than you give yourself credit. Second if the opportunity was given to you by your colleagues, they are probably aware of your abilities - if this is for a lateral move, they may very well think you are well suited for a junior position where you can learn and grow. Third - it is always good to get interview practice. The more real the interview, the better - the process and interview itself will be a learning experience. In regards to embarrassing yourself - you say you are not currently in a technical position. The people interviewing you know this and know this is a lateral move for you. This does mean that if you don't show a high level of technical knowledge, it is expected. Interviews are not exams - you don't get scored, as such. 

If you like contact your old company and offer them your service for x amount of money for y amount of time. Maybe make a deal that you will answer phone calls and/or email for a certain amount of time. It seems they need your knowledge and probably it will be good for their business if you help them out for some time. It's business, you don't have to be shy to ask to get paid for the work you do. Deals like this are not unusual. And normally people who do this kind of consulting work get paid well - more per hour then before when they worked full time. 

If you answer 1 you basically tell him he does not pay attention to known bugs, not a good answer. If you tell him 2 he will likely be impressed (at least if it was something unusual). 3 sounds good because we all "discover" from time to time strange things. But more knowledgeable people probably will know many of these things already. 4 sounds like you have very little knowledge because you can't even imagine there might be something he does not know. 5 sounds like you have an attitude problem. And 6, your answer sounds very reasonable to me. You know some special things (you have knowledge) but you also recognize that the guy you talk to is an expert. Summary: I think your answer is a good answer. Maybe you don't get any "extra points" for it. But you also don't lose any evaluation points because of a bad attitude answer. One more detail about answer option 3: I would be very careful with that. If you tell the guy something unusual that he also maybe just discovered he will likely be impressed. If you tell him something which maybe 50% of all programmers know then you show him that you are 50/50 experienced. If you tell him that you just discovered what most programmers know after a week then you better shouldn't have answered like that... 

I get that you are concerned in regards to the feeling that you are being treated differently to other employees that have left, but... you are leaving? Why do you care about the perception anyone still at the company may have? If this is indeed gardening leave, just take it and go. There is no good reason to make a fuss about it. Use the time to find your next job. (or, given you already found one, prep for it, or just enjoy the break) 

You can phrase it positively in terms of who you do want to share with. Ask you boss if you can be assigned the same room with some of the people you do want to work with. Give a few different names so the boss has a choice between people you do want to share with. If you can add a good business reason for any of these persons (different skill sets, mentoring and knowledge exchange are good reasons), the likelier is a positive outcome for you. 

Once you have clarification on your questions, including perks, then it is time to make a counter offer. There is no point in giving a counter offer without having all the details you want to have - you will be acting on incomplete data (or as complete as you are likely to get). In terms of perception - I expect that asking questions about the benefits, perks, bonuses etc... would be expected by HR/hiring managers and would be expected before any counter offers on salary are made. Don't forget that not only salary is negotiable - you can negotiate on other things (vacation, start dates, notice periods, bonuses etc...). 

Note that since you have no formal contract and thus presumably haven't been given your written statement of employment particulars then you are perfectly at liberty to require one of your current employer, if you have been there more than a couple of months. This doesn't necessarily have to give away the fact that you are job hunting. You could approach HR and say "Hi, I've just been catching up on paperwork at home and realised that I never received my copy of my contract or employment particulars. Could you get them to me as I should have got them within two months of starting". If they refuse or delay your request, then you can remind them that it is a legal obligation on both of you, and that you would really feel more comfortable if your working relationship were on a solid legal footing. 

Yes, in my experience this is common practice, but I don't think it is as deceitful as it first appears. You don't burn your bridges, either as a an employer or potential employee and sometimes, recruitment takes a while. You can genuinely want someone, but then find someone else is a better fit for business or operational reasons. Reading between the lines of what you heard from the VP and the recruiter though, I would say that all this means is that you are currently second choice on their list. They are probably waiting to hear back from someone (possibly via a different recruiter) with slightly more experience than you. You are probably their best culture fit, while someone else is their best experience fit. They want to keep you sweet because they are confident that you can do the job, even if it takes a little longer to give you the extra skills they think you need. They want to maximise the chance that you will still be available and interested if their first choice doesn't accept their offer. With respect to the recruiter, they are probably playing down your chances to stop the recruiter calling them every five minutes nagging them for an offer. They probably don't care about keeping the recruiter sweet, so depending on how aggressive the recruiter is, they might say anything to get them to stop calling. From personal experience, I have missed out on a number of jobs where people have very apologetically phoned me to say "I'm really sorry, I think you would have been great here, but we really didn't expect to find anyone who had experience with X, Y and Z.". People can be genuinely complementary and want you, but circumstances beyond their control might push them towards another candidate. Essentially, someone who can hit the ground running will usually be preferred over someone who will take a while to get started, even if they may end up being a better team player in the long run. So, don't give up hope, keep looking, and try to assume the best of people rather than the worst. 

Yes, sure, I know about this bug xyz which was published on the abc website Yes, sure, I published this bug xyz on the abc website I recently discovered xyz, but probably you know about that already I don't know anything you don't know Yes, I know many things you wouldn't know I know you have a lot of experience, I can't think of anything you wouldn't know. 

Whenever something like that happens tell the guy right away that you don't like it. And in many cases that will solve the problem. The problem with some (many?) guys is that they consider no reaction is a good reaction. They think if you don't say no this means yes. You didn't say no the first time(s) so the guy thinks something like "It seems she liked it. If she wouldn't like it she would have told me so". And with this "positive reaction" in mind the guy thinks about what he should/could do next. It will be something more and he will look at your reaction. And if you don't react (he thinks you like it) then there will be more and more... You have to stop it as soon as possible. If a guy does anything to make you uncomfortable then tell him you don't like it and he should stop it. Or if it's bad then slap him in his face. He will understand that and likely he won't do it again. Obviously it would be good if guys would see on your reaction that you don't like what they do. But some guys (or maybe many) are blind in that way. They don't see what they don't want to see.
