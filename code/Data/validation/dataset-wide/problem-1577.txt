Obviously not scientific, as it is only one of many stories like this. But even if only a handful of thieves can not drive stick that is at least a tiny bit safer for American manuals. It is not a single event either, maybe not common but it does happen somewhat frequently and here is another example 

I did my own table to review pure numbers. I took the top 11, and bottom 11 nations by "religiosity" and referenced numbers from Wikipedia's religious numbers and also added murder rates (most available crime data it seems) and then added in poverty My own chart, once complete looked like this: 

I have heard this, and several other stories much the same... I believe what it really boils down to is this: 

As commenters noted, several spanish people commented on the clip, none claimed that the translation was false. The original buzzfeed article was in spanish. Google translate of the above seems to agree with the translation. That said, even the English translation doesn't show the judges evaluating the girl based on her (lack of) faith. The statements that comes closes are more in the vein of "You are not a good enough singer today, and as long as you don't believe in god you will never be good enough." 

The article author of the article that you linked to wrote an earlier article in 1994 where he measured the ethanol content of unspoiled honey. This article of Journal of Agricultural Food Chem from 1994 gives the natural ethanol content of honey as 27.9mg/kg. 

Also, this story has been reused dozens of times, Carinsurance.com, MSN, and here is FOX The best information I can see is anecdotal from the police force: 

In the top 5 most homicidal countries, Muslim is on the list twice. In the top 11 (half), Muslim slots in 5 times, and 4 times in the bottom 11. This seems pretty even handed to me. Although Buddhism has 100% of its representation in the top 11! And finally, for the sake of mentioning it, unaffiliated is 75% in the least homicidal half of the chart. 

The sodomy case does not appear to be disputed, but why Leonardo was arrested for it is. Perhaps it was as much about politics as it was about his sexuality. Freud also believed Da Vinci was homosexual, and although he tended to think every man and woman had an obsession with phallic objects, it is worth reading some of his reasoning. 

The language to note is "on reasonable grounds". IANAL, however I take this to mean that the police must have reason to believe that the noice on your hard drive is encrypted information connected to their "proper performance"; and that they must be able to demonstrate that reason. In short it's insufficient for the police to say "Give me the key to this encrypted information". It's insufficient for them to say "Give me the key to this encrypted information because I believe it to be connected to the case I am working on". They need to be able to say "Give me the key to this encrypted information because I believe it to be connected to the case I am working on. And I believe this because of ...". I do not know what standards govern the things that go into the dots. If they are able to do the above the sections contested by DJClayworth and Konrad Rudolph comes into play meaning that if you can show that you do not have the keys; for example if you can show that the "encrypted data" is in fact a recording of background astronomical noise, which you keep as a source of entrophy, you would not be liable to hand over the key because you are not in possesion of such a key. - For this you need to have sufficient evidence to cast doubt on the issue of you having the key, and for the police not to have evidence that you have to key. 

Although there is a lot of speculation, we will never know for sure. What evidence there is, is pure speculation, but it does make a decent circumstantial case: I think this is a good setup: 

So maybe that "tiny fraction" means %.001 or ~5% inline with the manual sales. I think the best we can do for an answer though is either it depends or it is unknown: 

I think this one actually fits my thesis best! I am not cherry picking this either, I am googling "why do [group] live longer and looking at hypothesis that aren't all voodoo. 

In the USA, it certainly makes at least a minor difference. There is a running theme on Jalopnik of stories like this 

The answer would be No. - Assuming that the number of CPU's produced follows also follows a power law. The reason; If CPU's are produced by year . And if the number of transistors on CPU number where given by . Then the number of transistors on the CPU produced at the end of year would be . - So we would expect a super exponetial growth. While the points indicated by vartec might cast doubts on the question of wether CPU production is still growing exponentially, we should look at the time when the law was formulated. 

This is an expansion to the answer given by DJClayworth above, since he quotes a less than relevant part of the law. The passage given by DJClayworth describes an afirmative defence against request under section 49 of the law quoted. Section 49 is at $URL$ . Section 49 states, among other things; 

Note Religious in my graph is percentage of the population who are in the majority religion. I then made this chart, sorted by highest homicide rate, and added in poverty for the sake of seeing other possible ideas / solutions: 

Many agnostics / atheists are isolated for one reason or another. Many are not. I think there is a correlation to attending community events, such as a church, and not. I do not think church itself is any sort of causation. In the article linked to there, a Daniel Hall, resident surgeon reviewed studies and suggest essentially this: 

My conclusion is that Islam does not lead to higher crime rates. At least not as the sole predictor. If there was a good predictor, from what I gathered above it is poverty. Most likely though, in my opinion the nations with the highest crime rates have a very complex explanation that includes poverty, diversity (or lack thereof), region and religion.
