Greaves actually developed in the later Middle Ages as a component of full plate armour. So in this specific example, the "reappearance" of greaves was basically just part of the general advancement from mail to plate armour. Despite the shared naming, these plate greaves were very different from the shin guards of the dark ages or antiquity. Those are more precisely demi-greaves. The motivation was of course the better protective value of plate. For most of the Middle Ages, chain mail provided "good enough" protection while maintaining decent flexibility. However, over time, weapon advancements inevitably eroded their protective value. 

In the same article, Kenan further advanced another theory, namely that the actions or policies of the West - chiefly the United States - were actually not very important. He implicitly affirms the idea that the Soviet Union fell to domestic factors, dismissing the idea that an external power could cause such domestic upheaval as "childish". In this view, the Western allies were little more than bystanders, witnessing the fall of the Soviet Union to internal pressures. 

Tibet Once upon a time Tibet was, in fact, a powerful empire that posed a credible threat to Tang China. That did not last; however, like Korea, Tibet remained a distinct polity separate from China in most of the centuries since. While Tibet was always liable to be within the Chinese sphere of influence (again c.f. Korea), this only became more pronounced from the late 18th century onward. It is difficult to say when exactly did Tibet fell to China. A good point however is 1792, when the Qing Empire, fresh from saving Tibet from the Nepalese invasion, was able to impose unprecedented controls on Tibet. The most important measure taken was the Chinese intervention in the succession of Tibet's religious/political leadership. Nonetheless, as late as 1904 Great Britain could still sign a treaty with Tibet: the Convention Between Great Britain and Thibet (1904). And in 1907, two European Great Powers would declare: 

That salaries were inadequate and fixed for long periods despite rising costs were a continuous issue. For example, in 1816 the American Ambassador to the Court of St James's, John Quincy Adams, wrote to then Secretary of State James Monroe that: 

The maximum extent of de facto Nationalist control in China was achieved around 1946. This is after the Second Sino-Japanese War ended, and before the Second Chinese Civil War began in earnest. At this point, the Nationalist Government had recovered all of its pre-war territories (at the height of the Nanking Decade), and made several major additions including: 

While some fighting at sea most likely did occur, there's a paucity of records on the actual details. Western sources have generally dismissed these as little more than harassment tactics, if even mentioning them at all. Any battle that took place were probably quite minor. Nonetheless, during the second invasion two relatively more notable engagements occurred. Sea Battle of Takashima-oki. After linking up at Hiradoshima, the Mongol fleets advanced to Takashima in preparation for assaulting Daizaifu, the Japanese HQ. On 27 July (in the traditional calendar), a Japanese fleet attacked the moored ships off the shores of Takashima, and supposedly fought till nightfall. Battle of Mikuriya Sea. The famous typhoon that wrecked the Mongol ships occurred a couple of days later, on 30 July. The Japanese fleet launched to clear the surviving Mongols from Hakata Bay. At this point the Mongol fleet was either retreating, or the commanders had taken the best ships and fled first. This was probably a pursuit action on the part of the Japanese. 

Indeed, an Indian presence was attested to in Alexandria, a major cultural and commercial crossroad. The orator Dio Chrysostom, for instance, remarked that: 

The German Navy also attempted to send some light destroyers into the region. This flotilla consisted of the Type 32A destroyers Z24 and Z32, as well as a salvaged Dutch destroyer ZH1. Thet were however intercepted in a battle off Brest, turning back after losing two ships. The remnants of the German heavy surface fleet in the Baltics did not react to the Normandy landings. 

Archaeologists may well have discovered very old signs of roped animals, but I do not think history is capable of pinpointing the exact moment it began. For one thing, the Stone Age is not exactly known for its record keeping. That said, there exists 8,000 year old rock arts of giraffes with a leash. If this was an representation of domestication (potentially plausible, but no definitive evidence AFAIK), then it is not unreasonable to expect that at some point someone might have tied the leash of their pet giraffe to a tree. This doesn't prove they tied anything to wooden posts, however, so it's not exactly what you asked for. 

Is there proof that all of these explanations, backgrounds or chronologies we have are at very least very likely to be spun in the favor of Rome All of them? No. Certainly Rome did fight some wars in self-defense. However, as the above quote demonstrates, just because the Romans claim to be the victims doesn't mean their reasoning wasn't obvious self-serving excuses. Take for instance the Third Punic War, where Rome all but forced Carthage into war with an unending series of unjust, oppressive demands, and yet deigned to call themselves the victims. None other than Polybius provides ample proof ot the Roman injustice in this regard, reported that some observers: 

Coats of arms was essentially a form of personal or family identification.It was generally a mark of the nobility, but can also be granted without ennoblement or freely assumed. In the latter cases it might represent a luxury or a higher social status than peasants. Specifically, in Switzerland, just about everyone possessed arms. 

I know this would not be to OP's liking (considering his expressed opinion of Chinese history), but other people might find this interesting. The earliest event in Chinese history with a verifiable year is the Interregnum following the expulsion of King Li from the Zhou Kingdom. With the king exiled, his chief ministers ruled the realm in his stead. They declared the year, 841 B.C. , to be the first year (epoch) of the Joint Harmony era. That event's significance is that it marked the beginning of consistent and preserved record keeping in China. The epoch changes with whenever the person on the throne changes - the Joint Harmony era terminated after 14 years, with the coronation of King Xuan becoming the new epoch. However, records were kept and added to year after year by every subseqeunt Chinese governement. Major events and government affairs were hence forth recorded by contemporary court historians in official annals - as opposed to being written down by a later historian. Most of the early records have, unfortunately, been lost over time. The earliest annal in continuous survival is that of the State of Lu. Here is the year 722-721 B.C., from the State of Lu's official annals with rough translations: 

There is some truth to the claims, but the numbers are extremely prima facie distorted. Especially since they are (apparently) given in terms of "households", with no immediately obvious method by which such figures were fitted to a preconception "estimated" calculated[Note 1]. Even if his numbers are accurate however, they do not necessarily reflect the true picture[Note 2] and should only be taken with a very large grain of salt. Full disclosure: I have not opened that youtube link, and have no intention of doing so. Please fill me in if I'm misrepresenting his position. 

That passage is based on the works of Henry F. Dobyns. In his 1983 book, Dobyns advocated for a 18 million strong pre-contact population in North America. Specifically, he gave an estimate of 5,250,000 people living in the Mississippi River valleys. This, according to Dobyns, amounted to a population density of 2.53 per km2. 

Since the author served in the Royal Navy, a logical place to start would be the British National Archives. Much of their records have fortunately been digitalised and can be searched online - including service registers from the early 20th century. A search of the officers' service records reveal a Lieutenant Commander Richard Travers Chaloner Woods, born on 30 January 1901, who received a commission in the Royal Navy at the age of 18. This is, in all likelihood, the author you seek. Incidentally the name also appears in the December 1920 Navy List of active duty officers as a midshipman since 11 October. For more information on Woods' life, his service record, catalogue number ADM 196/148/689, can be read for free at the National Archives at Kew. Alternatively, a digital copy can be requested for a small fee from: $URL$ 

Yes. There was at least one case from the very start, during the 1886 election. This was of course the birth year of the Liberal Unionists, and they formed a close alliance with the Conservatives thereafter. 

By October 1930, the decline had reached 26% in production, 16% in income and 14% in prices. It is thus plausible to argue a recession was already in progress by the time Wall Street buckled. A conventional view is that after years of intense speculation, the bubble was ready to burst. 

This marked the appearance of cheese in the Korean diet. Cheese is not a component in conventional Korean cooking, however, and consumption thereof remained (and in relative terms, continues to be) light for decades. As late as 1990, total cheese consumption was only 7,000[1] tonnes - around 20 grams per person. Korean appetite for cheese has since experienced tremendous growth, driven particularly by the adoption of western style food such as pizzas. Nonetheless, as late as 2013, the South Korean per capita consumption of Cheese was only 2.2kg[2]. For comparison, the average American consumed 15.7kg[2] of cheese in the same year. Sources: 

Davis was not being punished for merely fornicating, but specifically that he did it with a black woman. One readily sees that black people were regarded as distinctly inferior, to the point that sex with one is equated with "defiling". 

Though the system had largely fallen apart with the death of most of the genrō, it nonetheless it lasted until the rise of militarism in early Shōwa. In 1937 the last genrō resigned his powers and saw them replaced by a similar but less antiquated group of elder statesmen. Thereafter the premiership became dominated by the military. 

It was the newfound relative affordability of plate armour, combined with improved designs reducing its tactical downsides, that ultimately enabled its adoption. The full plate armour reached its peak about the same time advancements in projectile weaponry began to render it obsolete, however.
