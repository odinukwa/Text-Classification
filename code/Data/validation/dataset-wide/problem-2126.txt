Some teams are either designed or aspire to be self-managing. There are aspects of every project that someone other than the "manager" needs to take some control over. It's always good to have team members who can step up and lead one day. There may be some insight on how you'll follow based on how you lead. When given some authority, you really learn how well people can get along with others. In the modern workplace, individuals are expected to have some level of self-management. There will be times when a new person gets hired and you may need to train them. You're going to need some leadership skills, but not in the sense of being a true boss. There are fewer and fewer positions available for people who just want to be told what to do all the time. 

Your boss understands the situation and has tried to help you avoid this person. You're not the only one and it appears he focuses on the new people. He is making it personal. His gossiping is very unprofessional. 

Contact the company of your first choice and ask if there is anyway you can get an answer on or before a given date. Unless they ask, don't tell them you have another offer. They may assume it. You're not trying to give an ultimatum. If they can't, just thank them and hope to hear from them as soon as possible. You never know until you have an offer, so keep your options open. 

I know these examples could all be resolved, but it could take time or hinder your ability to perform. Early on, you're going to be very paranoid that others will think you've slacked off since the move. Keep positive and always communicate. Pick the phone up and call more than you did at the office. You don't have as much face to face as you use to. There will be little jokes about how you're not working or sitting there in your underwear, etc. Laugh them off initially, but make sure your supervisor knows you're getting things done and as many others as possible. Don't let the haters who are back at the office take it out on you. Let them know you're setting the standard and if everyone believes this worked out, it could lead to more people working from home even if it is just a day or two a week. 

Maybe you need to get out into the field and see how they do things? It seems like there may be time issues that you assume everyone has nothing else to do but deal with this problem. Everyone manages their work differently and some things are being put in front of this problem. Just because it is at the top of your list doesn't mean it isn't at the bottom of theirs. 

The Grass Isn't Always Greener Do some research and decide why you think the new job is better than your current one. Just because one opportunity is better, doesn't mean the other one is bad. Although you may not have been compensated/recognized for your efforts, you current company does let you do more. You can now put these accomplishments on your resume/CV and get a better job. Some interviewers may notice the discrepancy between your title and actual responsibilities. Let them know you took the initiative to do more, but the company didn't have the room to promote you. It happens. Some day you're going to have to explain why you're leaving a good job. 

Does having your back to the door bother you? Avoid the seats with a blocked view. Does facing dirctly at another person distract you? I've never sat face to face in an office without a cube wall that I couldn't see over. Large monitors may be good enough. 

Valve could be a good company inspite of this. I think Microsoft has the same ranking system. Maybe their employees are willing to put up with this because of the prestige and level of salary they get working for these two companies. Many people like working for smaller companies because they don't do these types of things. Everyone on your team knows who is the best. If you upset your best programmer and they leave, you lose a huge asset. One programmer leaving Valve won't break the company and they stand a better chance of replacing them anyway. It's difficult to give an objective evaluation to someone knowing it will impact my bonus. It is a competition after all. I can't imagine you'll get any positive feedback on this from your team. 

It's difficult for extroverted people to understand why someone is introverted. What is shyness or just an enjoyment of being private (reading, writing, thinking, playing music) can be interpreted as uninterested, rude, snobbish, etc. They don't see how anyone could possibly prefer to stay home alone instead of going out and being with people. When no one is around, they call someone on the phone. That's their nature. Don't be afraid to thank the person for the interview and mention how much you're interested in the company and/or the job. If there are requirements for the job that are usually done in private, mention that you are comfortable working alone. You can practice acting interested, but that is going to take time and unfortunately, difficult to maintain throughout an interview. You'll get deep into some subject matter and forget to "act" interested. Follow-up the interview by thanking the interviewer again and mention your interest in the position. People tend to remember the beginning and the end of things. 

After working the job for 5 months, list what should have been expected of you. Determine if you've been given any kind of feedback indicating you are not performing at the expected level/need to improve. 

How did you select who was in charge? Did you find anyone that had experience/knowledge in this area? How did you make sure everyone was involved? Is this how we do things back at the office? Should we? 

The new company may be willing to pay you, so just come up with a number. Who knows what they lose if they don't get you started. The more you know here, the more you can ask for. would you accept more vacation time the first year? Not all hiring managers have the same amount of flexibility in their offers, so work within the areas they have room. Offer to work for the new company part-time if you need training, getting up to speed or just a few hours of work on the books. This could be after-hours, weekends, vacation days, etc. You'll have to check with your current employment agreement to see how much of this you can do. Until you get all the facts, negotiations are going to be limited. 

Yes, ask the question. I hope the answer involves wanting to continue to focus on programming. We are losing good programmers to management positions or at least programming positions with management duties. Would someone ask a great author to consider being an editor? Many star athletes and other performers make more money than their managers. I hope this person is able to convince you that he is passionate about programming and is willing to take less pay/responsibility for the opportunity to do more of it. Depending on the two companies and the nature of the software development, the two positions may be more equal than you think. I'm proposing a new career-track for programmers: 

A salary range leaves room for negotiation. Part of the negotiation is based on job salaries in the current market. The company may know what they want, but may find a completely different set of candidates are applying from what they expected. They'll use someone's current salary as an excuse/reason not to offer too much more. This has been asked on this site about disclosing salaries. 

I don't think it is common, but I would expect the HR person to explain why she is there. It could be company policy (Still nice to know why.). You should have asked. More HR people (assuming they have the expertise) need to take an active role in in training and evaluating the reviewers. Not everyone is good at it. Google crunched the numbers and found the best way to predict a good hire was by looking at who hired them and who suggested not hiring them. Since you did not ask, this may be a sign that you are not comfortable with the way your company operates. Is there a reason to be suspicious? If not, go ask HR and give them some feedback that you didn't feel you could be open in the meeting. Maybe you need another meeting with your boss without HR present. You shouldn't wait for the formal review to work things out with your boss either good or bad. 

I'll use some programming examples to help it make sense. Your company is claiming a realignment because they are altering their target market and/or what they are offering. This is the same as making a major coding change like being a desktop application to a web app. Reorganization means you aren't changing your target market and/or what you offer, but how the company is structured internally to manage what you do. This is similar to refactoring your code. You could be making major changes in the amount of code, but the code still behaves the same way. Or think of it as the difference between keeping or breaking an interface. Other than improved performance, the customer really shouldn't recognize a reorganization. Could you really tell if Microsoft increased or decreased the levels of management from a customer's perspective? Now if Microsoft decided to shift from focusing on hardware and removed a lot of their software offerings, customers would notice that. 

I think it is sad that your supervisor let this go to the point where the only feedback you got was after this person was fired. You need to be managing your time, so you need to know much sooner if your boss feels your time is being wasted. Everyone on your team needs to get on the same page. If the leader's plan is to make new hires sink or swim with no help, there's not much you can do about it. If you feel like some sort of mentorship program should be setup, make sure you address the amount of time that can be allocated. It's hard to attract talent, so any help that can get someone over the hump should be considered. 

I think some of your concerns for the company like preventing employees from getting outside recognition is unethical and bad business. This isn't that different from someone writing a book or presenting at a conference. I can't imagine a company preventing these either. Since this group was formed and funded by the company, you should notify them about your participation and check your employment agreement on their ownership of the work products created by this group. The company may not have to worry about all of you leaving and starting another company because they may own the software. 

Sounds like you want what would be divulged in a stand-up meeting, in writing. This is your reasoning for the information: 

It just doesn't seem like you've gotten to know this new employee very well. He could be just trying to get attention, but I wouldn't assume he's really trying to change the culture. If he was really offended, he'd probably say a lot more about it. Do you really need to take this person that seriously on this matter at this point? I've heard people make these kind of statements, but they really say it "tongue and cheek" more as a joke because they swear as much as anyone. Find out if profanity really bothers this person. Reinforce the idea that this is a very ingrained habit with no intention of offending him. Then again, would you speak this way at your grandma's house? 

Based on everything you've said about your situation, I doubt you're charging at the high-end of the consultant scale. There are probably other programmers you under-bid. Often those who charge less have less experience, so the customer should beware that projects will take longer, estimates are less accurate, there will be some on-the-job learning. You were an inexperienced programmer put on a project all by yourself, so your manager mitigated his risk by not paying you. 

If they have one engineer out of a hundred who inteviews you and happens to know the answer to your questions, you may not have learned much. 

I think these people are just getting off on their claims of how hard/long they are working along with covering up for the project failures. Try to get some perspective from your direct supervisor and gauge how well you're doing along with understanding her expectations. That's really what counts. At some point you need to determine how long this project is going to go on like this. HLGEM mentioned stress experienced by people getting close to a competition. Hopefully you can handle this for the time being. The team is in a death march and someone needs to stop taking so much pride in this. I don't know who created the mess you're in, but you should find out and decide if things will get any better. I wouldn't count on it. 

How can you be an effective leader if no one is allowed to disagree with you? Maybe in a perfect world the leader of a company should be able to separate views of their personal beliefs from affecting their company, but that's not reality. The Dixie Chicks, Duck Dynasty and Paula Dean suffered the same fate. Firing them is going to fall under your local laws. At least in the US, you can't prevent people from attempting a lawsuit. You can only take actions not to lose. Personally, if they are effective at their job, why fire them because of your personal animosity? EDIT: Anyone who is the voice of a company who thinks with modern day social communications can make even slightly public disparaging comments about "those people" and get away with it, is a fool. Remember the two guys at the tech conf. who told a sexist joke and someone apparently went too far in trying to publicly shame them and lost her job? You have to be careful these days. 

Make sure this person isn't a better coder for the long-run. He may get features out slower, but if they are of higher-quality, it's difficult to have an argument against that. Not getting things done fast enough to stay within budget is part of his job. Someone who is responsible, needs to step in and work towards a correction. Maybe he needs to be help accountable. Hopefully, someone would be willing to work with him to solve this problem before drastic measures are taken. Maybe it is the use of other tools. Don't be surprised if you force him to make a switch that his productivity declines. These things take time and are worse if the person doesn't believe it will help and isn't motivated. Apparently someone in charge is now aware of this problem or they're doing nothing about it. Maybe they feel the rest of the team will pick up the slack? I would let this person know that you have no intentions of doing that especially if he won't compromise and use other tools. 

Describe the project(s) you've worked on and indicate your role in the design and modeling. Mention if you used any known strategies, methodology and best practices. Many websites have different components: graphics, UI, server, database, tiers, layers, so list the parts you worked on that are relevant to each job application. The amount of traffic the site could handle would be an indication of your design ability as well. Those interviewing you will know the difference between designing a page in html and a full web application. 

You say you speak "impeccable English" but do you communicate well? There's a big difference. Athough you may be a good enough technical programmer, are you exceptionally better than what they can find locally? If not, they may have concerns like fitting in and staying in the country for a long-period of time. They may think it will take you much longer to relocate and get settled in before you can work. I'm surprised they gave you any reason at all, so I don't know how deep to read into what they are saying. It's like, "We're going in another direction." Jobs may have particular criteria and you may not think this should be included, but you're being compared to other candidates. They may not have considered this before interviewing candidates outside the country, so I can see why you may feel it's a waste of time.
