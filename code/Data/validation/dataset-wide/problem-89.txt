If you are willing to sacrifice those types of orbits and the habitable zone, consider a world like this: Jupiter's moon Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, making its surface uncharacteristically hot for where it is. The tidal forces that Jupiter and Europa enact on it cause the activity. Although Io is a harsh and toxic environment (with all the sulfur and volcanoes and whatnot), you could entertain a scenario with milder heating, making it warm enough to be have liquid water. Given the lack of sunlight, perhaps the creatures on the planet evolved to use chemosynthesis, like some of the animals that live near sulfur vents on the ocean floor? Who says that the "habitable zone" is the only place that can support life? This is where the fiction in Science Fiction comes in, and where it gets fun :) 

If he can physically move any element (or combination thereof) within a ten-mile radius, the character is actually indistinguishable from someone with powerful telekinetic ability (who could move any physical matter). The question is really a function of how complete his control is. Since you edited to say that he expends strength proportional to what he is moving, you could simply send a missile at the guy. It would take a LOT of energy to flat out stop a modern missile going several times the speed of sound. Even if you have to use more than one, you said you have an unlimited budget - just keep launching them from safely outside his ten-mile radius. As far as the cheapest way, you wouldn't want to go for a direct offensive. I would say use some form of trickery, like poisoning his food supply. But with an unlimited budget, I can't think of a reason you'd have to. More complications might be necessary to make an interesting situation. 

Depending on how limited the phenotype you're looking at is, you might make the scenario work if you can keep your desired phenotype manageable to a sex-linked trait. It will only work with traits limited enough that they can be sex-linked, since those genes are only a portion of their overall genetics - but I suppose a limited gene on that chromosome could activate, or work with other genes to create the phenotype you're looking for. Most genes are duplicated, there are two copies (one from each parent) - this is a backup and safety net, but it will also allow recessive genes to hide, which you're trying to avoid. Sex-linked genes can avoid this redundancy, to some degree - matched genes (and therefore recessives) are only possible with females (XX), while males are defined by their unmatched genes (XY). In either case, since the genes are split by parent, and there's no room for redundancy, you can get a sort of generational cutoff, where genes are either expressed or not present, just where that lack of overlap happens So, looking at your setup, something attached to the Y gene will always breed true to sons, and never to daughters. Something attached to the X gene can't be passed on by sons if they themselves don't show the trait - if it doesn't express itself, they don't have it. A daughter cannot pass on any portion of a trait from her father's Y gene, and a son can't pass on anything from his father's X gene. Y linked traits, therefore, would either be present or not, full stop - no recessives. X linked can be recessive, though only in daughters, so you might need to think about it a little more. You might make it work by simply have two or three Y-linked genes (either one, two, three, or one, two, neither), for your three phenotypes, and leave it at that. Having two x-linked traits might almost work with a little tweaking, since boys would have one, the other, or neither (three states), girls could have one or the other, with having neither for the third state - you would have to assume the traits are dominant, and that those inheriting both are simply non-viable and don't survive, or else that will get tricky. Pairings between parents with different traits will simply result in no daughters, as well, but it might be possible after all that. Of course, this is starting from earth humans - if you're building a people, you might make something more workable by tweaking the genetics. Any gene which not going to be matched can eliminate recessives - perhaps your species doesn't need redundant X-chromosomes, allowing for XO to be female (eliminating the possibility of recessives again, they will be expressed or not). Or perhaps there's a different set of genes which goes through a haploid cycle, for whatever reason. Plants, I think, alternate haploid and diploid generations - something like that will eliminate the possibility of recessives, whatever is there will be expressed or it was never present. 

Pew-Pew sound would definitely not come from the laser beam itself - light doesn't make any discernible sound. I could see you making it an artifact of the power rapidly charging and discharging, though it's not necessary for the device to function. Typically solid state electronics are pretty silent. As mentioned in a comment, light moves way too fast for you to see. Assuming you could shove that much electrical power in a blaster-sized package (not possible with modern technology), you might have something slightly close. Some differences includes that there would be no recoil to the shot, and no explosive impact - it would burn the target, and not much else. Also, even the most powerful modern lasers take time to put a hole in a target - a sustained beam, not a gun-like shot in a single instant. 

Now, some of these things are very low-level, subconscious functionality of the brain. While I always feel emotions and am usually conscious of them, I might not always be conscious of my own motives or intentions. Even if I am self-conscious enough to be aware of them, can I really articulate them, even to myself? Sometimes it takes weeks or months of introspection before one really understands some part of themselves. I personally think it would be unlikely for others to be able to sense those deep things "at a glance," as they aren't really feelings. I might have strong emotional feelings for someone, but may have no intention of starting a relationship. Does the intent transfer, or just my warm fuzzies for them? Because unless I mentally articulate the intention, it could be a source of miscommunication, if not really a lie. Memory - now this is a fun one! Memories might consist of thoughts and feelings, but in reality they are neither. Do others have access to only what I am remembering at the moment, or does everyone within telepathic range share a collective memory? But I'm digressing from the question of lying. Based on what you describe, no, I don't think it's possible to intentionally deceive someone, which is usually via misinformation. Moreover, the social dynamic would be extremely different from ours. I don't think there would be cause for intentional communication - if everyone knows X, you can't articulate X any better to them. It would be redundant. I doubt there would be language or words - just a flow of abstract concepts. I don't think this society could even be aware of the concept of lying or deception, which makes an extremely interesting premise in itself. 

I was thinking face-masks. People usually focus in on the face when identifying somebody definitively, which means a face mask will be front-and-center when it comes to identifying people. Additionally, if people are very against being mistaken for other people, than focusing in on the little identifiers (clothes) is probably less effective than addressing big identifiers like having the same face. How would it work? I would guess cloth face masks, since they will be more comfortable to wear long term and light to carry. It would also be pretty easy to personalize, too, between cloth choices, embroidery, and other decorations. They don't have to be full face masks, either, choices among partial masks can be an additional layer of identification, with one person preferring a full face mask, another just an eye mask, and a third a mask over one side of their face. And one pocket or pouch full could carry a lot of masks, for a person to change into. Culturally, the mask would then be your "face" in a way skin-and-bone would find problematic, when bodies may be shared among so many people. It would be no more abnormal to them than us wearing other kinds of clothing (or identifying things about people from such). There could be a set meaning to going bare-faced, like signalling changing personas, or it could be a privacy taboo, where people do not bare their faces without a very good reason and perhaps people would keep a blank mask to have something to cover their face with if something happened to their personalized one. If, for whatever reason, it is important to identify people form behind or without seeing their face - it may be useful to pair with scarves or shawls. I mean the light, thin ones large enough to drape (easier to carry multiple, then), possibly reversible to maximize the number of variations for less cloth carried. Color plus pattern plus wearing habit (tied shoulder-to-hip, draped around neck, wrapped around shoulders, as a belt) can again individualize a person pretty distinctly without seeing the face and without having to make elaborate changes. I think it would still be best paired with masks, since it's easier to notice differences like sash or scarf when not using the same face for identification. 

There are indeed natural objects (called Trojans) captured in Jupiter's L4 and L5 bands. One gotcha is that for planets the size of Jupiter to form at all, they must be out of the habitable zone. Closer to the habitable zone (our side of the Asteroid Belt) causes dense rocky planets to form, but the solar winds that close to the Sun blow away the massive clouds of dust and gas that compose Jupiter and all of the gaseous planets. (Parenthetically, this formation pattern is why many don't consider Pluto a planet. It's more likely a captured foreign object.) According to Wikipedia article on Lagrangian points: 

It's possible, as other answers indicate, to convert kinetic force into electricity, so I won't repeat that. But what you should think about is the cost-benefit ratio. The truth is, it's not feasible to add the complexity of an extra subsystem to an already ridiculously complex system. Think of the amount of electricity it takes to accelerate anything to several times the speed of sound. Power savings from a kinetic converter would simply be insignificant. 

I agree that range is the primary consideration. But if you're willing to flex that requirement, say hello to my little friend Joerg Sprave. He also has a how-to video so you can build this contraption yourself! Has a number of advantages and disadvantages over traditional tranquilizers, but the main advantage is that it's more fun this way ;) 

Cloth armor - specifically, linen armor - was a thing, historically. It was used, tested, and could be quite effective. it was lighter and, reportedly, more comfortable and/or maneuverable than other armors, for the tradeoff of being also not quite as effective. Silk was more expensive, so there don't seem to be as much evidence for cloth armor made of silk - but on a cloth-for-cloth basis, there doesn't seem to be any reason the same kinds of techniques shouldn't work, if you have enough of the silk to make it cost-effective. A Greek style armor called linothorax was reconstructed through using a lamination technique to transform linen cloth into stiff plates - essentially using multiple layers brushed with glue. This reconstruction was tested against arrows, and a thickness of 12mm supposedly would have been enough against any arrow the wearer was likely to encounter for about a 400 year period (see link for original tests). Quilted Gambesons or Padded Jacks were sometimes used under other armor, but also sometimes used as a standalone. they were made from many layers, perhaps as many as thirty, of cloth quilted together - Linen was a popular choice as it was available, lightweight, and fairly effective (though some incorporated cotton, wool, or leather for extra effect). Testing of a reconstruction showed that such all-linen gambesons were an imperfect, but effective armor - the armor blunted some shots and reduced others to what would be lesser injuries from many of the arrows (though not all, depending on the arrowheads, see link for original tests), and proved somewhat effective even against spear or sword. As for silk, I've vaguely heard of quilted silk armor being used (like the gambeson, up to thirty layers quilted together) among the Japanese and Koreans historically - and even in modern times, since this kind of armor may be bullet resistant, depending on caliber. However, I don't have nearly as good historical references, or testing information, about this kind of armor. Xplodotron's previous answer mentioned the use of a layer of silk and air pressure could deflect most (70%) of the arrows fired at it, which seems to indicate silk resists penetration pretty well as a single layer (compared to linen which I could not find used as a single layer for armor), and suggest that a layered silk version, like the linen armors, would be quite effective. So your basic choices might be quilted silk, using many layers to resist the penetration of arrows, spears or swords; or else a laminated silk, where the layers are stiffened with glue to form a kind of plate mail. The first is going to be a lot more flexible, and probably easier to make, adjust, or work with, with the tradeoff of somewhat lower protection (arrows and the like might still penetrate, but much less than without the armor - and it does much less to protect against blunt force). The second is a lot more tricky to work with (and you'd need the glue, though a relatively low quality rabbit glue was well used) - and each piece of each armor must be separately laminated and fitted (it will resist tools as much as weapons), making it more labor-intensive but also a better protection. Of course, since you plan for an abundance of spider-silk, maybe you could use both, either/or depending on the warrior and their role in fighting, or a hybrid with reinforced plates over vital areas, but quilted armor over other areas for more maneuverability. I don't think you could make a visor out of it - you might get enough transparency to get away with a single sheer or gauzy layer, but you would get very little protection from it, and it would reduce visibility. At most you might deny your opponents an aiming point (faceless! aah!) if you used that single layer in conjunction with other silk armor, like a laminated silk helmet that does cover the rest of the face, but still allows openings like knights' helmets had for seeing through and such. 

It really depends on the type of telepathy you as the author/creator envision. There could be telepathy that is purely intentional, akin to speaking or sign language. If others can always sense your thoughts or emotions, that might more properly be called mind reading or emotional empathy. In the latter, people still might be able to put up walls around their mind to pad or mute the effect. So ultimately, you get to choose. Additional considerations: First, on a communication level, what is truth? What separates truth from a lie? Whether I say the sky is blue or orange, there is nothing inherent in my communication that determines one or the other as real - truth is determined by the facts of life, regardless of what is communicated. The only exception with telepathy or mind reading would be sensing the intention to deceive, and intention is not the same thing as emotion. You mentioned "evolved" telepathy, so consider what else might have evolved along with that - a subset of related functions that facilitate communication, including "blocking" thoughts or projecting only what is desired. Some might be better at communicating visual imagery, like artists, while musicians would have a much more detailed concept of audio information. Some might not be good at this - you probably know people in real life who are terrible liars with just words. And anyone can run and jump, but watch the Olympics and tell me you can swim life Phelps. People can train and hone their natural skills to do amazing things, and as a natural ability, I can't imagine this would be an exception. Edit In response to OP's comment defining his or her brand of telepathy: Others have answered about "lying" to oneself, so I won't repeat those. "Feelings" then, must be very precisely defined. Particularly, distinguish between:
