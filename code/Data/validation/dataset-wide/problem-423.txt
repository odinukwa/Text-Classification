There are two reasonably simple solutions here. They both start from the moon having a molten core but it has cooled more than earth has. The planet's crush has locked and there is no longer tectonic activity. Then to create your hot spots you either have a hot plume coming up from the core that still reached the surface. Look for information on Mantle Plumes. The second and more dramatic option is to have a huge meteor impact onto the moon, sufficient to shatter and weaken the crust enough for magma to come out. The shockwaves would then travel around the moon and meet at the far side, causing weakening there. This would explain two "hot spots" at opposite sides of the planet or moon. 

There are two real ways this could happen - the first is an asteroid strike which would have lingering affects even though the initial impact was quick. The second would be some sort of large release of buried gas (for example there are massive quantities of methane and other dangerous gasses trapped in our continental shelves). That methane if it were released would be bad for anything that needed to breathe, and also highly flammable and possibly even explosive. 

Assuming the people on board Deimos are doing everything they can to be seen, about 5 years. Alpha Centauri is around 4.37 light years away. So that is the absolute minimum time for whatever is being observed to reach Sol from there. The scientists aboard Deimos would immediately set about building the most powerful transmitter they can. Lets say it takes them a month or so to recover from the transport event and work out where they are. They then have a month or two to prepare a transmitter and start broadcasting a tight beam directional radio message. Considering we were beaming messages to nearby stars back in the 90's (for example see Cosmic Call) scientists with near-future/future tech should have no difficulty making themselves heard. The directed radio messages will be far more effective than any sort of increasing the brightness of Deimos. Quite apart from anything else there is very little light to reflect in interstellar space! 

In the short future there will still be a lot of use for ships. Drones need something to base from, they need command staff, operators, maintenance. In addition a lot of operations require boots on the ground and a human touch. There is a certain psychological factor to having a massive warship pulling up alongside that helps win wars. Yes you could build a drone with a 1000 mile range but in doing that you compromise on its other functions so some form of drone carrier and base is going to be needed. In the long run that base may also be automated, but right now people are needed to maintain and recharge/refuel/rearm the drones. If you were asking about 50 to 100 years time that may well change but these changes happen slowly. After all there are a lot of military ships in use today that were built decades ago. 

At its closest point the moon is 220 thousand miles away. At its furthest it is 250 thousand miles away. That is a difference of 30 thousand miles! Clearly your airship is going to plow into the ground or fly off into space if you are not careful, there is a way around this though. At around the L0 point (so the weight of the cable is not relevant) you have a winching station. That winching station would spool in and out the cable as needed to keep it at the correct length and the airship at the right height above the surface of the earth. However there is a much bigger problem: The moon orbits the earth in 27 days (approximately). The circumference of the earth is 25 thousand miles, 27 days each of 24 hours. This would pull your airship through the air at 39mph. However, the earth is spinning once every day. This pulls the airship in the other direction at 1041mph. In other words your airship is being pulled through the air at a combined speed of 1003mph, or considerably faster than the speed of sound at 761mph. Not only is this creating a sonic boom for anyone underneath but the drag and forces exerted on both airship and cable will be incredible. The cable will also be pulled a long way from vertical and have to be much longer as a result. 

Your main problem is the time delay, causing it to trigger on the same day in everyone infected is basically impossible. Even if you counted number of replications that would still drift by a large amount. There would need to be some other cause that triggered the transition to the hostile form - most likely an otherwise harmless chemical agent. 

The classic case here would be the Pegasus, it's a winged horse so already familiar to people as a mount. You can see them as being a very expensive upgrade on the horse, needed much better food and care, and costing an absolute fortune. They would be ridden or used to pull enchanted vehicles. Imagine a stagecoach but pulled by 6 winged horses, using enchanted wheels to make itself weightless and then pulled through the air. It would be epic! 

Unfortunately there is no one simple formula you can apply here, each factor can vary greatly. For example a house cat on a carpet where they can dig their claws in is incredibly agile, the same cat trying to make a sharp turn on polished wooden flooring could well slide into the wall. We can discuss each factor though. Muscle Power Larger animals have more power available, the raw strength increases with the square of size (as it's the cross section of the muscle) but total power does increase with the cube of size (as it's the volume of the muscle) so larger animals can end up with plenty of power to work with so long as their tendons and bones can take the strain. Traction Claws and hooves are common adaptions to increase traction but you are still limited by the surface area of your feet. Larger animals become increasingly susceptible to problems getting traction and are able to slip and fall more easily unless they can grip something with their claws. Mass Mass increases with the cube of size. That mass takes power to accelerate. The positioning and layout of mass should also be considered. Keeping the mass central and being able to adjust it dynamically for example by twisting your body gives you a big boost in maneuverability. G-Force Rapid acceleration and deceleration can cause serious injuries, that are easier to handle for smaller animals. Additionally the terminal velocity of smaller animals tends to be lower due to their higher surface area to mass ratio. As a result longer falls are survivable for smaller animals than for larger ones. Stride length Larger animals need to take fewer steps to travel the same distance or the same speed than a smaller one. This allows them to grip once and then apply the power smoothly over time rather than constantly re-applying it. Leverage Longer limbs give more mechanical advantage to muscles - so long as the muscles can have enough strength to take advantage of it. Energy Storage Fleas wind up springs in their legs in order to release it in a single bound - jumping far further than they could without that. Similarly Kangaroos bounce very efficiently due to springs in their legs that store energy when landing then use it to propel the next upwards leap. Air resistance Air resistance effects larger creatures less as it is proportional to the square of size whereas mass has increased by the cube of size. A large creature can jump further if it starts the jump at speed X than a smaller creature starting at the same speed just because it is not slowed down by the atmosphere as much. Conclusion In general larger creatures do not have to be less agile than smaller ones. Their muscle power is proportional to their mass, they have advantages in terms of leverage and stride length, and they are less restricted by air resistance. However they are also limited by the strength of their bones and how much traction they can develop. An elephant's muscles and skeleton could be tuned to allow it to run like a Cheetah, however it would snap every tendon and bone in its body and when it tried to accelerate it would throw more dirt backwards than it would go forwards. Rhinos though have been measured running at 55km/h with a surprising ability to turn and maneuver while doing so. So for a certain range of sizes there is roughly constant speed and turning radius no matter how larger a creature grows. Once the limits in strength of materials and the limits of traction from the ground starts to be reached then the available maneuverability starts to decrease. As maneuverability decreases then increased speeds become more dangerous and less useful so top speeds also tend to decrease as other methods of defense take priority. 

So if your hypothetical life form either did not have the same sort of circulatory system (either no blood at all or self sealing and re-routing blood vessels) and no vital organs then you could pump them full of bullets and they would just keep coming. Ever tried to shoot down a tree? You can put a few holes in it but you need a stupendous number of bullets to cut one down. On the other hand hacking weapons such as chainsaws, axes, and even swords at a pinch, will take off large sections of the creature, incapacitating it much more quickly than even a hail of bullets. Of course this doesn't stop the use of explosives such as RPGs, so something else would be needed to prevent that. That could be as simple as an environment that makes such weapons incredibly dangerous for both sides such as a flammable atmosphere or being set in a space station. 

The thing is, bullets don't actually do that much damage. They punch a small hole through things. That's bad for humans (and most other animals) because:

The main reason airships stopped being used (apart from the hydrogen safety issue) is speed. Airplanes just get you there faster, a lot faster. In a hypothetical world where wings were never invented (or just don't work), or where high density power sources such as aviation fuel are not available, then airplanes would not take over and development on airships would continue. For example one big factor that if changed might help airships remain dominant is gravity. Increased gravity would make it much harder for wings to function, but would not affect airships anything like as badly. The presence of strong and reliable trade winds at certain altitudes or locations would also help with this, get the airship to the correct position to ride the trade winds and it will then take you where you want to go. It may interest you to know that airships are still not completely out of the running in the real world. There is a lot of interest in using them as heavy lifters since they can carry massive loads much more cheaply and easily than other air transportation and several military and civilian outfits are looking into them.
