Assuming you want the center of gravity of the bike alone (not with a rider), there is a very simple procedure you can perform yourself, as long as you have some bike (you could borrow one): 

The front part of the mudguard might become too short, and some drops might start getting on your face at high speeds on rainy or wet days; If you go down some step or curb, you should take extra care not to hit the rear part of the fender against the obstacle. 

So, the answer is your second option: All Outward (heads facing inward) Radial Lacing, UNLESS (!!!): 

I'd say the rider is the damper, since that few milimeters of travel can easily be "swallowed" by rider's action/body after he got used to it. (I ride very rough streets with an old steel road bike, and for sure, based on what rough streets feel like to me while on the bike, I would love to ride a bike behaving as the one shown in this video.) 

But, to be honest, I cannot say any of the above for sure, because I didn't test it. If it is of any help, I use my ring upside down, and raindrops get inside it, but even so it rings just a bit less than dry (not a lot less). It is a steel ring, the type that has a lever and a spinning mechanism inside (which I strongly recommend over the model you've shown). Also, I have a set of similar rings on my bikes, and none of them has the same acoustic properties, I think there are some subtle factors involved, most probably the relation between the bell's main frequency and the frequency of natural resonance of the raindrops on the bell (I'm serious!). Hope it helps 

There is a lot of truth in all other answers so far. This being a somewhat complex matter, but considering it's perhaps the biggest operational cost of a bicycle (the other would be new tubes), I want to offer my cents. First of all: The chain has ALL responsibility for the wearing of the drivetrain. If you take new cogs and rings with an old chain, the drivetrain will be destroyed VERY quickly. But taking worn-out cogs and rings, and using them with a "theoretical perfect chain" which wouldn't wear out, would actually make the cogs and rings wear BACK to good: the teeth would be progressively thinner, but their profile ramp would be fine. This happens because a worn chain, having a greater distance between pins, touches "higher" on the teeth and creates a ramp (sharktooth) profile, causing a new chain to skip. A new chain, in the other hand, always touches the bottom of the teeth, then wearing them out by "thinning", instead of "ramping" An excellent text about chain wear and wear measurement can be found here: $URL$ The problem is: usually you can ride sligtlhy worn cog with slightly worn chain, but sometimes you cannot ride wlightly worn cog with NEW chain, because the chain skips. It depends how much the cog is worn. The same might happen with chainrings, but it is much more rare and usually happens only when the bike is seriously neglected (and seriously ridden!) So, answering your question, I propose this "plan" to extract every kilometer a drivetrain can give, with the least money spent. Some tips might require boring manual labor, so you should measure this cost, too. In the other hand, I feel "wrong" throwing away a part which I know is still usable. The planet thanks. 

In the first place, if the title is not properly describing my question, please edit it. The fact is: the bike advocacy groups of my city are slowly getting some attention from City Hall, and bicycle culture is slowly growing, with some cycle paths and education campaigns. The growing of bikers, in the other hand, is much faster, and there are a lot of people prone to advocacy and putting pressure on the politicians. We are beginning to think about asking to build a public velodrome (track), nothing fancy, but something that would allow regular folks, respecting some rules of course, to train in a controlled environment instead of in traffic. The problem is (and now come the questions): 

The bikes themselves - in this case, the frame - are pretty much standard on all the modern mountain bikes. The Hollowtech and Octalink systems are different because you need to match the crankset to the bottom bracket, that is, you cannot use the BB from one system with the crankset from other system. But any of the bottom brackets can be installed in the same type of frame (the "default"/ISO 68mm wide, 1.37in diameter, 24 TPI). Hope it helps 

Most hub manufacturers forbid lacing spokes radially, mostly because there is less material in the radial direction away from a flange hole than in the standard 3-cross, tangential lacing. (UPDATE: as it appears, the actual breaking point is the material betwen consecutive spoke holes in the flange, the spoke holes acting like a perforated-toilet-paper effect...) I have previously laced a Shimano front hub radially and rode it a lot, and nothing happened. Some friends of mine have done the same in the past (allways front wheel, always XC mountainbike), and nothing happened either. Currently, I have just laced another hub radially, and I am pretty sure nothing evil will happen, but still there is some discomfort for doing a theoretically Wrong Thing. So, I want to ask you about FACTS (disregarding what manufacturers say): is there any WITNESSED (by yourselves, not internet stories) evidence that radially spoked FRONT hub flanges have ACTUALLY BREAKED? Any photos, stories, or preferrably shop experience? (ANOTHER UPDATE: as already mentioned, there are a lot of photos and stories about hub flanges broken with radially laced spokes. But, as it turns out, if the search terms contain only "broken hub flange", and not "radial", there are also a lot of photos and stories of broken flanges with standard cross-laced spokes. This makes me think of flanges braeaking for a lot of possible causes, but when this happens with radial spokes, it draws more attention and provokes some confusion bias about causality, relating the failure to the spoke pattern instead of other form of abuse or material wearing.) Thanks very much! 

The last two increase the rate of evaporation, the first by increasing the internal energy of water, the later by reducing the relative humidity of the air layer close to the fabric. Then (always theoretically) one possible way to dry a shoe quickly would be to force-circulate warm, dry air inside a newspaper filled shoe that has been previously centrifugated/squeezed after being rinsed in warm water with a bit of alchohol. The problem that still persists is how to actually implement this air heating and circulation without a complicated device or combination of devices... I use to put newspaper inside as you described, but for the first three stuffings, I squeeze firmly (stepping over if necessary) so that most the moisture is mechanically removed. Then I put extra, dry newspaper and leave the shoes hanging in the open air. Unfortunately, depending on weather conditions, this not always work. 

Also, it is necessary that it counts the time between revolutions, not the number of revolutions during a fixed time interval, because time is a continuous (floating point) measure, and number of wheel turns is a discrete (integer) measure. If the second option would use, the speed would always be "rounded" to the nearest possible integer value, giving incorrect results except for very high speeds. 

Most of these somewhat larger punctures damage mainly the rubber and not so much the tire fabric (plies). If that is the case, a simple cautionary patch on the inside (with a regular tube patch) is enough to warrant peace of mind. If the tire is bulging around the hole when it is inflated at the pressure you use, that is a warning indicating the tire is probably too damaged. A larger or stronger patch might be used inside the tire, and some regular observation to see if it stabilizes or grows is needed, but most probably it would be better to get it off the bike (which is very sad when it is a relatively new tire). Hope this helps 

During one single winter, most probably you'll still get the same model aftwerwards. But experience suggests that these fashion-oriented goods are constantly "replaced" by "newer" (as in "better") ones, if not just for the sake of change (which, of course, makes me upset). So it is with frames, suspension forks, derailers, tires, clipless shoes, you name it. As a side note, I can remember a few times, regarding regular clothes, that make me think: "Oh, if I knew this thing was so good, I'd have bought more than one, for I can't find it again..." Hope these thoughts help! 

Tire choice is important, also. On a skinny-tire road bike, I would not feel safe or comfortable to put a rear rack in nothing but the smoothest of paved roads. In the other hand, I have already made loaded touring in roads that looked like the moon surface. How much is too skinny, or fat enough, depends on each person/bicycle/road. In the end, the answer is "it depends", but I think the three (four?) parameters mentioned here are the most important about "what" it depends on, IMO. Hope it helps. 

You could use any Shimano derailer. I would go for Acera or Alivio, since they have good quality and good price. Some SRAM might work, but beware that SRAM and Shimano have a different "cable pitch" (amount of cable pulled for a given amount of lateral movement of the derailer pulley). Even though, SRAM manufactures a few models which are compatible with Shimano levers, and also some shifters which are compatible with Shimano derailers. Also, if the "cable pitch" of the system is correct, you only need to match the cassette model and the shifter model (in your case, just keep your cassette and your shifter). Hope this helps EDIT: if it is a road bike, perhaps Acera and Alivio couldn't be the best choices, but I'm not up to date with Shimano options for road derailers. Anyway, they are interchangeable regarding "cable pitch". 

The "centrifugal force", and the leaning of the bike, will prevent your tire from slipping. Of course this depends on actual conditions (rain, traffic, road height) at the moment. Hope this helps! 

As others have pointed, heart-rate alone is not enough to organize a comprehensive training program, and some preliminary steps (fitness tests, mostly) are necessary so that you can properly train guided by heart rate zones. The main idea is the following: heart rate is one of the best measures of your physical effort. Each person have an individual maximum heart rate, depending on a lot of factors, mostly age. When you know your maximum rate, then it is possible to calculate the HEART RATE ZONES, as percent ranges of that maximum, which are directly related to training levels. Below a given zone there is no training, inside a given zone you keep the conditioning you already have, above a given zone you are improving your aerobic level, and so on. This can also be used to actively rest during an interval training, when you apply the next effort cycle only after some time below some threshold. Of course, this talk applies specifically for TRAINING. If you ride only for fun, then you can use the heart rate just to compare efforts, more "informally" speaking. For example, if you ride the same route at the same speed many times, you can look for the higher heart rates and know during which rides you were more tired. Also, there are some ways to measure POWER with GPS devices (STRAVA does so if you provide your weight and the bike's weight). When you relate power and heart rate, you can obtain a measure of your fitness and/or efficiency at a given stretch. With this flood of data nowadays, the possibilities are almost endless! Hope this helps! 

I think the first reason might not be right on good-quality suspensions which have good washers/O-rings to auto-clean the mud and dust away, and in these cases keeping it locked for too long might actually make the dust build-up even greater than a free-moving suspension. So, it seems to me the worst thing you could do to decrease the life of your fork is to use it locked when it should be actually open, that is, everywhere except very very smooth asphalt roads, or during long climbings, or during sprints. As for myself, like I said previously, I never lock the suspension because I cannot feel any disadvantage from riding it open, but lots of discomfort and even risks from riding it locked. BUT, I think it depends on preload (my fork is relatively firm), and with softer suspensions, where the bobbing might be too much, locking might be even necessary. 

One important difference between "mine" and "yours" is that "mine" is a helmet mounted mirror, and "yours" is a glasses-mounted one. The former stays further from the eye itself, so it needs to have a wider glass to provide a good viewing angle. The glasses mounted one can be smaller, and needs to be lighter to be comfortable. I think each one is a matter of personal preference, and in either case the very real and sure benefits far outweight the hypothesized risk, but using a helmed-mounted mirror is helpful if you have one helmet but a lot of glasses, and I think it is better to have the extra weight supported by the whole helmet/head interface than only by the glasses/head interface (that is, only the nose and the ears). Hope this helps! 

Fore-aft position, which should let you pedal with the metatarsal heads over the pedal axle, more or less; Lateral position, which should let a few free milimeters between the inner part of the shoe sole and the crank arm; The most important for you, which is the ANGLE between the longitudinal line of the cleat and the longitudinal line of the shoe. 

What will be the largest (heaviest, faster) gear, and what will be your smallest (lightest, slower) gear, one for cruise speed and other for steep hills. It matters to know WHAT these gears will be, as they determine your maximum cruise speed and the maximum steepness you'll climb. Since you plan to ride with your kids in a trailer, you'll definitely NEED low gears; How many gears you will have in between. As an extreme example, it would not be useful to have ONLY the above mentioned gears, since most the time you will want something in between. The more gears you have, greater the probability to find a comfortable gear for a given speed and/or effort level. 

And most important: go very slowly and check each movement. It is much more tedious to do so, but the result is much better and you avoid regret later (telling from experience). Using a symmetrically dished front wheel (perhaps the very one you will get assembled with the hub) would be best. Hope this helps. 

I don't think this should be viewed from a strictly legal or normative point of view, so I'll give my impressions as a former driver and as someone with some experiences of overtaking cars downhill by bike, either on-road and off-road (unpaved roads). First of all, if you drove like you were alone (hypothetically speaking), by no means you would endanger a cyclist. A biker coming down a steep road can sometimes be way faster than the car, but the rider still can choose whether or not to overtake a car, it's an option and it's the rider's responsibility. In the other hand, following a slower vehicle is not dangerous per se, just an annoyance, and if no overtaking is possible the rider should stop the bike and wait for a gap to open. Also, usually it's "common sense" for the bolder cyclists not to count on driver's cooperation in such situations. What myself and a lot of friends of mine expect from drivers is that they "do nothing, let us bikers handle this" (we even adivised this explicitly to a driver who went first on a steep offroad section once, and it worked great). Cyclists, thus, would expect the driver to just go on its way, and wait for a good oportunity without counting on driver's cooperation. That applies specially to very bold ways of going downhill roads by bike, most of them not agreed-upon by the rules of this site. Even having considered all of this, if the rider couldn't pass because of the road, and the driver would like to help the rider someway, I think the best thing for the driver to do is to wait for a curve in the opposite direction (to the left in coutries with right-lane-driving), and decrease speed slowly and steadily so that the rider can jump ahead safely and go on. No need to get out of the road or to stop the car, but a blinking light, a short horn and/or a hand wave would be perfect. I think it is important not to do anything of these suddenly, but instead very smoothly so as not to scare or unbalance the rider. From the driver's point of view, this stragety (slowing down until the rider overtakes) is safer than hurrying to try to open a gap from the rider, because in such roads bikes can be very fast with relative safety, while with cars safety levels quickly drop with speed increases. Hope this helps!
