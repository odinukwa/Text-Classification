I hate to say it, but this is a lot of effort to get high-altitude airships. Anti-gravity (assuming it wasn't fictional) works on mass. Where usually two balls attract, now one or both repels because the nature of the mass has changed. Gravity is (from a certain point of view) directional. So something as ethereal as air would be repelling all the air around it and you probably wouldn't get any lift. Worse, what would keep the engine from working on the infrastructure of the cabin? Why use a balloon at all? Lift in airships is created by density. The density of the gas inside the balloon is less than the density of the air around it, so it rises. It will rise until the density of the outside air is equal to the density of the gas inside the balloon. What you need is something that makes the gas inside the baloon less dense. You might be getting to the point where you're overfocusing. The effort you're putting into making the airship work will become a distraction in your story. What I'd suggest is that the magical element be the gas. Gas so low in density that it can achieve the altitudes you're looking for. 

Insterstellar's primary crisis is the most obvious answer to your question: to save the human race. If the options were (a) for Humanity to be erased from the cosmic narrative and (b) to colonize a planet where we would be forced back to the 1500's technologically, why wouldn't we take option B? I suspect that given Humanity knew generally about its upcoming demise, you'd have people of all walks and education lined up for hundreds of miles to get a seat on that particular bus. 

In other words, if we tag this question hard-science, delete my answer, and wait for one person to provide an insightful answer, the question might be the only question on WB:SE to qualify for the Tumbleweed badge. On the other hand, in a rare instance where no single question may represent the "one best answer" Stack Exchange prefers to see, the sum of several insightful answers may provide the OP what he's looking for. I'm moving forward on that premise. To the Peanut Gallery: If my science is off, rather than whining about it in a comment, add an answer that explains why my science is off! This is a complex enough subject that your insight is infinitely more valuable than your complaint as it will take a lot of us to provide a "complete" answer. 

The answer can be "sure," but it depends on how you build everything else about the system. Let's set up an example. 

The idea that water takes the path of least resistance is fundamentally true for everything. No one would count digits/not thumbs, flanges, knuckles, etc. That's too much work. Your bats would develop base-8 and the humanoids would simply deal with it. But, if you think about it, human counting hasn't always been base-10. We've done odd things for odd reasons. Like hours in a day, or pre-decimalization British money and pieces of eight. So, while your batoids would most likely count base-8 and that will thow an amazingly interesting curve ball into the mix. But you need to focus as well on how numbers are used because that will affect things, too. These influences include the whims of kings, religion, practicality, and a host of other non-count-on-my-fingers reasons. Your humanoids can easily accomodate base-8. But, if you think this is fun... wait until your society needs to leave the gold standard because the good, honest folks have discovered clipping coins is more valuable than the original coins, themselves! 

The metal used has a ton of effect on the outcome. The 1903 Wright Brothers biplane was powered with a combustion motor made of 92% aluminum, which suggests that even aluminum is not light enough to solve the steam-powered problem. Add to this the nature of the two engines. The combustion engine wants all the combustion it can get with as little heat possible. It's the explosion that's valuable. (Desire: High combustion, low heat.) Compare this to a steam engine where you want all the heat you can possibly get because the actual combustion process is worthless to you. (Desire: low combustion, high heat.) Said another way, combustion engines are designed to withstand the force of combustion. Steam engines are designed to withstand the force of heat. 

The Ugly All it takes to prove the existence of a planet, even one that is visibily hidden, are observation, time, and mathematics. We've been proving the existence of "bodies of mass" for a long time because orbits don't make sense unless everything is taken into account. Therefore, while your planet may be visibily hidden, it cannot be mathematically hidden. If your light side peoples have calculus, they can prove the existence of the planet. Which might not be that ugly, as it could be an interesting plot point. Things you can't see are easily forgotten/ignored, even when a small group of scientists keep reminding people, "there's gotta be something there, and here's how massive it is...." The limitation is that the mass of the two objects will need to be nearly identical (I think) to minimize instabilities. The greater the difference, either the greater the distance between the two worlds (making travel very difficult) or the greater the possibility one will want to orbit the other rather than both orbiting the star. The Bad while your proposed orbit is theoretically possible, the reality is that it is unstable. Any change in mass, distance from the star, even the rotation of either or the worlds (or a passing comet, for that matter), and the orbital sync would fall apart. If either planet has a moon, it's probably impossible (but only an astrophysicist could confirm that statement). However, that might not be a show stopper becasue things can take a honking long time to change when it comes to stellar phenomena, so it might be that the two orbits are not actually sync'd, that one is only just faster than the other, and we happen to be in a... say... 1,000 year period when your hidden planet is actually hidden. That might actually be a useful plot point for you as the existence of the planet would be common enough knowledge for people to not actually think about it (how often do you think about the back of your knees?) and, better still, it's existence would have basically become myth. Of course, those pesky scientists are still reminding people it's there, but your average response might be, "yeah, and according to popular fairy tales, dragons live there... don't we have something more important to talk about?" The Good (or, at least, the really cool) It might be a bit more complicated, but with a bit of handwavium, you could set up an argument for a Lissajous orbit around Lagrange Point L2. Lagrange points are (simplistically) gravitational eddies that can be orbited like an actual body of mass. L2 is directly in line "behind" a planet such that the planet always shields the point from the sun. A Lissajous orbit is one that requires no artificial propulsion to maintain. Granted, it ususally requires a loop around earth to maintain momentum, but I mentioned handwavium, right? This concept could allow you to create a moon that is never seen by the light side. Note that those pesky scientists are still yammering about some mass that keeps affecting the tides (and it would be a wild and wooly affectation, too... did I mention plot point?), but there are ways to discredit/silence/ignore scientists. 

We need only look to plants on Earth to see how you can get generally blue plants on your world Green is the most common color because Chlorophyll absorbs blue and red light, reflecting the green. That has a lot to do with the chemistry of Chlorophyll, and changing Chlorophyll to reflect blue is far too much trouble. Besides, Earth has already solved the problem. May I introduce you to the Malaysian tropical plant Begonia pavonina. This plant (and its varieties) have a cobalt blue leaf because it uses a different process for photosynthesis — one that uses the more voluminous red-green spectrum rather than the blue spectrum used by Chlorophyll. It needs it because very little light penetrates to a tropical rainforest floor. 

But, wouldn't predators attack the group? Not necessarily. Earth history suggests that animals (including predators) tend to shy away from humans because they're not a natural part of the surrounding. This would be very true with a migrating group, where the scent and behavior would be completely unknown to the local wildlife. The exception is the one predator who's so hunger he'll attack pretty much anything — but planning for the worst-possible-case example has always proven economically and efficiently foolhardy. Therefore, this would only change if your world has predators that would attack indescriminately and somewhat frequently. In other words, if there's a reason to push the group together. And there's a reason not to walk as a big ol' group Anyone who has hiked as a group through tall grassy areas knows the value of a trail blazer. The trail blazer is the person at the head of the line who's cutting the trail. It can be hard work and is frequently traded off to give people a chance to rest. The reason this is done is so that the rest of the group can walk with greater ease, conserving energy. Walking in a big group like you describe would be hugely tiresome because the trail is the proverbial thousand times wider than it must be. All those trail blazers must occasionally trade off with rested people, and there aren't a lot to trade off with when so many are involved. People would quickly regroup back into the line as it would be easier and faster. This behavior is generally even true with areas of low brush, where a single winding trail through (for example) sage brush is easier to navigate than a whole group trying to walk over (or around) so many bushes. Frankly, groups like you describe are only efficient on asphalt and maintained lawns. And unless your group has a remarkably strong caste system, "defenders" are just the strong (usually males). Finally, it's actually pretty expensive to dedicate strong backs to defense. Nations can afford that expense, but migrating groups probably can't. Most if not all of the strong men and women will have some kind of armament and would be expected to act as defenders should the situation arise. But, generally, when not taking their turn as a trail blazer, they're helping everybody else along. You're moving a small community, not a nation or an army. At a guess, everyone would be interrelated and the community would already have formed strong help-each-other tendencies. Conclusion The grouping you describe is unrealistic unless there is an outside force acting on the group to keep it in that order. The complexity of the design is unrealistic in all cases. You'd have defenders on the outside, everyone else on the inside. Little or nothing more. A group so large that the complexity you suggest might make sense would be using scouting parties as a primary defense, negating again the need for the circular group. The grouping they would naturally take without an outside infuence is a strung-out line, with the trailblazer at the front, a few defenders behind him, the bulk trudging along, and a few defenders in the rear. The exception to this would be hunting/gathering parties for food or scouting parties. I can easily imagine that you're putting the cart before the horse. Rather than building your community's rules and behaviors and then letting the design of this group shake out naturally from the story, you're trying to create the group from an "outside" point of view and force it on the characters of your story. Life doesn't work that way, and your readers will realize that you're forcing the situation. 

Let's ignore the "how" and focus on the consequences. Remember that the Apollo spacecraft sent men to the moon with less computational power than you have in your pocket scientific calculator. With 64Kb of total memory and running at a whopping 43KHz ("Kilo-Hertz" ... you should be thinking "AM Radio") and at a time when "threads" was a word that described the shirt on your back they were nevertheless capable of getting them there and back. But, how would I and/or We react to the sudden loss of our 10-core, 20-thread, 4.5GHz, 128Gb memory Intel i9-7900s? (1) An entire generation of children would instantly become zombies as their streaming video, streaming audio, and cloud-based games would suddenly stop. The ensuing bloodbath would puzzle archeologists for millenia. (2) All traffic control for airports and large cities would stop. Insurance companies would be inundated with claims for everything from fender-benders to the obviously-it's-the-airline's-fault death of some 500,000 people. Which will only be staved off by... (3) The sudden end to all communication. Many homes today don't have POTS telephone connections, which may not matter since all the analog switches were replaced with computer-driven digital services decades ago. No telephones. (4) Banking would be thrust back into the 1800s. You may not see the mortgage collector for years, but he/she'd show up in an effort to claim your home as an asset for a suddenly defunct bank. (5) Our educational system would hicup, but catch up fairly quickly. Teachers who have been forced to use old, outdated textbooks would suddenly find themselves the center of attention as those books would be the only books to be had for a while. Once dead newspapers would come back to life as antiquated printing machines were dusted off and reporters would be considered important again. (6) Not to mention fuel distribution, electrical distribution... the lights might come on (maybe, sucks to be driven by a nuclear power plant... or to live near one...) but the whole world would be sucking wind for a while. The resulting panic would drain every shelf in every store you can imagine. The chaos for the first week would be... impressive... Except for government. True, the Snowdens and Wikileaks of the world would dry up very quickly, but the clowns would still be in control since their most frequently used technology is their pie holes. You just won't hear about the latest sex scandal that quickly. How long would this last? Not as long as you think. There are a lot of scientists and engineers in the world, and it wouldn't take long to figure out alternatives that would move us from the 1960s space-race to at least the 80's hay-day of personal computing. (Intel 4040 processors, anyone?) 

With the exception of blood type O-, humans simply can't be given "any old blood type" without the potential of causing serious harm. I assume that in reality, a newly-dead body would still react negatively to an attempt to give the wrong blood type (which might be done in an attempt to resuscitate the body). Therefore, would death release Vampires from the blood type restriction, or would they also be restricted in what blood type they can consume? Please note that this previous question asked if there would be a nutritional difference. That is not what I'm asking (and I agree with the answer). Background Curiously, science doesn't completely understand how vampire bats metabolize blood. However, they do know that it involves using a plasminogen activator in their saliva (which we have in our blood to prevent coagulation). (source). Beyond this, it appears that vampire bats metabolize blood in the same way all other foods are metabolized. What do they do with that blood, anyway? OK, after having some fun reading up on the history of vampires in fiction, and not to invalidate existing answers, or to deny my deepest respect for the Marvel comic universe, I've decided to go with the (obviously obvious) belief that Vampires have ichor in their veins. Therefore, blood is ingested only for nutrition and is not directly conveyed into the bloodstream. 

You'll find some hard math here, but the short answer is: if you're moon is unpowered, you cannot have a spiral orbit. That's simply not the way the universe works. As mentioned by @Slarty, you could have a very long elliptical orbit, but there's a limit to how long the ellipsis can be before the moon walks away from lack of gravitational pull. If you love physics & math (or simply want to learn something cool despite the headache it will give you), read Wiki's page on orbital mechanics. The basic truth is you can't get what you're looking for ... kinda. Let's examine some goods and bads. However, you're writing a story. Maybe the planet and the moon have higher than Earth-standard gravity, which would allow a longer ellipsis. Perhaps the moon is made of very dense material, which would also allow a longer ellipsis. Or maybe you just make it that way. High declination Another possibility is to put the moon's orbit on a high declination, such as the orbit of Pluto or the orbit of some asteroids around the Sun. This won't give you years, but it would make the moon appear aperiodically from the perspective of the planet's surface. Its orbit must be outside/inside (not within) the rings A gotcha you need to worry about is that the moon's orbit must not be within the rings, otherwise the rings will slowly pulverize the moon. An elliptical orbit with a high declination would allow it to move inside the orbit of the rings, but without the declination, it would need to be completely outside the rings (meaning from the right place on the planet you would always see a line across the moon as the rings cast a shadow). But, it's artificial, so it can be what you want But, everything I've been telling you is from the point of view of using gravity to keep everything in order. If you give the moon power then you can have it do what you want. That's really the question you need to answer: does my moon have the ability to apply force to correct/control its orbit? If yes, then it does what you want when you want. If no, then it doesn't matter if it's artificial or not, it must obey the laws of celestial mechanics (with a little literary license thrown in to keep astronomers on their toes).
