The definition of a fossil is "evidence of past life preserved by geologic processes". By this definition a coal bed is itself a fossil since it is the preserved organic matter from an ancient swamp. Oil and Natural Gas that are formed by the change of dead algae under the heat and pressure of being buried in the earth. These would also be fossils. Methane, discussed in another answer, can form inorganically in the solar system and there are people who claim to have found geologically ancient deposits of it remaining from the time of earth's formation. Even if these claims are accepted (and they are controversial) it is only a very small amount of our natural gas supplies that are not the result of ancient organic processes. 

Identification of metallic minerals, even when holding them in your hand, is difficult. So I can't tell you what you have. It could be silver, it could be silvery pyrite (so called fool's gold that can appear with this color). The rock appears to be a hydrothermal vein filling which Nevada has a lot of. This is the environment where you would expect to find metallic minerals. The white mineral is quartz and the pinkish mineral is rose quartz, the color often coming from manganese included in the crystal structure. The way the old-timers would check out this mineral a hundred years ago is to grind the sample to a powder, separate the metallic mineral by specific gravity (e.g. by panning), and then precisely measure the specific gravity and do chemical analyses in a blowpipe flame on a carbon block. Today we just do x-ray analysis to get a quick elemental composition. You didn't say which town's parking lot you found this is in. The only way to get more precision about what this mineral is would be if someone with specific knowledge of the geology of quarries around where you found it chanced across this question. 

Agreeing with Christoph that the model you seek does not exist. When I was in grad school I programmed a model that could calculate the surface temperature based on solar radiation plus a large number of factors including the current air temperature, slope and direction of the surface, amount of shading by vegetation, previous nightly low temperature plus some essentially unknowable quantities such as the thermal conductivity of the soil. About a dozen inputs if I remember correctly. The model showed a good match to observations but was not a climate or weather model which is what you are asking for in your game. 

The Richter Number is a measure of total energy released in an earthquake. To calculate it, even roughly, you need to know the epicenter of the earthquake (that needs at least three measurements from three locations) and the length and intensity of the shaking to determine the energy contained in the waveform. All you seem to have with your accelerometer is the peak intensity of the shaking at a single point. So the answer is no. 

I disagree with John that a "true fossil" still has a component of the original material. A trilobite shell that has had its chitin replaced with silica is a fossil even though all the original chitin is gone. I am not sure what your textbook's author is saying about a fossil that is the result of a shell's diagenesis (change in form as it fossilizes) could create a pseudomorph or impression. Usually a pseudomorph is a term for a false fossil, something that looks like it was alive but was produced only from inorganic chemical reactions - like rust staining of sandstone producing a shell-like pattern. An impression is usually the term for something like fossil tracks or burrows that show evidence for life in the geologic past, but are not themselves the preservation of a life form. 

There is more than enough UV in sunlight to make the minerals fluoresce, but... The amount of visible light from the fluorescence is low enough to be undetectable by eye on top of the incoming sunlight. 

There are two stages to what you want here. 1. Converting point data to gridded data First off, since you want to plot regular cells rather than the actual data that you have, you need to covert your point data to cells in some way. The best way to do this may depend on the data itself, but one way would be to interpolate, perhaps using something along the lines of, 

You're right. Water has a much higher specific heat capacity than air, so will change temperature much more slowly. This means that, 

and according to BOC contains 34 kg of gas, at a pressure of up to 50 bar. So that's 29.4 cylinders per tonne or, to contain 5 million tonnes of CO2, 147 million of these cylinders. 

All this can then be greatly complicated by sea and air currents, especially vertical circulation in the ocean - but you have the right idea. 

I have a bathymetry dataset that has a small section missing. I need to fill in this section. The bathymetry in this region has some strongly directional features (e.g. a canyon that runs through the missing region). Using a standard interpolation function would weaken these features. 

The question is hard to give a definitive answer to, as it depends on the pressure at which the gas is kept in the tank. But to try to give an intuitive sense of how much gas this is, let's work out two things: Firstly, how big the box would be at atmospheric pressure; and secondly, how many standard gas bottles it would take. At atmospheric pressure The mass of one mole of CO2 is 44 grams. So 5 MT of CO2 is $\frac{5\times 10^{12}}{44} = 114\times 10^9$ moles of gas. The ideal gas law tells us that $PV = nRT$ where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is the number of moles of the gas, $R$ is a constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin. If we assume a pressure of 100,000 Pa (roughly atmospheric pressure) and a temperature of 300 K (roughly room temperature), then $V = \frac{nRT}{P} = \frac{114 \times 10^9 \times 8.314 \times 300}{10^5} = 2.8\times 10^9$ m3. That volume works out to a cube with sides of 1.4 km. In gas bottles A standard large CO2 bottle of the type that is familiar in the UK looks like the one on the right of this picture: 

userLTK has explained that not all of the ice in the Antarctic stays frozen all the time. But perhaps there's a more basic view needed : sunlight in temperate areas melts all of the ice quite quickly, so why doesn't the same happen in Antarctica? There are a number of reasons, but the simplest (and probably most important?) is one of geometry, and the way that sunlight reaches parts of the planet's surface. Imagine that you are shining a torch onto a ball, where the beam from the torch is circular and much smaller than the ball. 

Starting from scratch and building a "toy model" is unlikely to be successful here, because while you could certainly model Newtonian tides, much of what happens on the continental shelves is tied very closely into the shapes of coastlines and bathymetry, the interaction between the inertia of the tidal wave and friction on the seabed, and so forth - a lot of non-linear effects, some of which are not fully understood. My suggestion would be to start with an existing, validated, global ocean model and tweak its input parameters. For example, to simulate a change in the gravitational pull of the moon you could change the amplitudes of the lunar tidal constituents that drive the model (and perhaps also their periods, if you wanted to work out the appropriate orbital mechanics!). Be aware that running models of this sort tends to be computationally expensive, obviously depending on the resolution - but it should be within the realms of what is feasible on a home computer, if you don't mind things taking a week or two to run (I assume, since this is a hobby project, that you don't have access to HPC resources for it). I'm not sure whether anybody makes a simple but validated model openly available - if anybody knows of one, perhaps they could comment. If not, you might have to build your own using an open source code, which would be substantially more work.
