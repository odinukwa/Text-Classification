To see that the set of ineffables is stationary, let $C\subseteq \eta_\omega$ be any closed and unbounded set. It suffices to show that the good indiscernibles arising in the definition of $\omega$-Erdos for the structure $(V_{\eta_\omega}, \in, C)$ are in $C$ since by what you have already shown such indiscernibles can be critical points of a non-trivial elementary embedding, and hence are ineffable. However if $\gamma$ is such an indiscernible then $$(V_{\gamma}, \in, C\restriction \gamma)\prec (V_{\eta_\omega}, \in, C).$$ By elementarity, as $C$ is unbounded in $\eta_\omega$, then $C\restriction \gamma$ is unbounded in $\gamma$. That is, $\gamma \in C$. [ Suppose $\mathcal{A} = \langle L_\delta[A],\in,A,B\rangle $ is a structure. $I\subseteq \delta$ is a good sequence of indiscernibles for $\mathcal{A}$ if for all $\gamma\in I$: (i) $\langle L_\gamma[A\cap \gamma],\in,A\cap \gamma,B\cap \gamma\rangle \prec \mathcal{A}$; (ii) $I\backslash \gamma$ is a set of indiscernibles for the structure $\langle L_\delta[A],\in,A,B, \langle \xi\rangle_{\xi < \gamma}\rangle$. We say that $\delta$ is $\tau$-Erdos if every first order structure $\mathcal{A}=\langle L_\delta[A],\in,A,B\rangle $ has a good sequence of indiscernibles of o.t. $\tau$. It can be shown by a combinatorial argument that each of the $\eta_\alpha$ as defined by Jech are $\alpha$-Erdos. (For this see: J. Baumgartner, Ineffability properties of cardinals II, in: R.E. Butts and J. Hintikka, eds., Logic, Foundations of Mathematics and Computability Theory, Reidel, Dordrecht, 1977, pp 87-106. However it is not the case that $\delta \rightarrow (\tau)^{<\omega}$ implies that $\delta$ is $\tau$- Erdos in general, but the least such $\delta$ (which equals $\eta_\tau$ in Jech's notation) is so.) An equivalent definition of being $\tau$-Erdos is the following: let $C\subseteq \delta$ be c.u.b. Let $F:[C]^{<\omega}\rightarrow \delta$ be any regressive function (i.e. $F(a)<min(a)$ for all $a\in [C]^{<\omega}$. Then there is a set $I\subseteq\delta$ of o.t.($\tau$) which is homogeneous for $F$: $\forall n \, |F$ " $[I]^n| = 1$. The notion of good indiscernibility was introduced by Jensen in: H.-D. Donder, R.B. Jensen, B. Koppelberg, Some applications of K , in: R. Jensen, A. Prestel (Eds.), Set Theory and Model Theory, in: Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics, vol. 872, Springer-Verlag, 1981, pp. 55â€“97. ] The equivalence of the model theoretic notion of $\tau$-Erdos and that with the regressive function partition relation, is somewhat folklorish (it is described by Baumgartner as ``well-known''). The one I have seen is in: A.J. Dodd, The Core Model, London Math. Sot. Lecture Note Series 61 (Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 1982). 

Re Q1: Sy Friedman has shown by class forcing over L that there can be consistently a real r with the r-admissibles precisely the recursively inaccessibles. (S Friedman, "Strong Coding" APAL, vol 35,1987). Re Q2: All $0^\sharp$-admissibles are limits (indeed fixed points in the enumeration) of Silver indiscernibles (as can be seen by iterating the $0^\sharp$-mouse inside the least admissible set containing it). So 2 is not a strengthening. One obtains strengthenings really by changing the model $L$ to some other inner model, such as a core model, for example $L^\mu$ the least inner model with a measurable cardinal. 

I'd like to add to Joel's generous and thorough answer. He is right to recall that if $\beta$ is clockable, then $\beta$ is writable in order type at most $\beta$-steps (thus improving the Lemma). One can argue this directly and it sounds like you have found the paper, but for completeness it is in: P.D. Welch ``Characteristics of discrete transfinite Turing machine models: halting times, stabilization times, and Normal Form Theorems'' in Theoretical Computer Science, vol. 410, Jan. 2009, 426-442 doi: 10.1016/j.tcs.2008.09.050, But actually there is a nice argument, which involves seeing how an ITTM can compute directly codes for levels of the $L$-hierarchy up to $\Sigma$, at the same time as computing the theories of each such level. Theorem. There is an ITTM program so that for limit $\alpha$ (i) it has at time $\omega^2\cdot\alpha$ on a section of its tape: a set $T_\alpha \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ so that (via some usual goedel coding) the complete $\Sigma_2$-theory of $(L_\alpha, \in)$ is uniformly r.e. in $T_\alpha$. (ii) at time $\omega^2\cdot\alpha +\omega\cdot2$ on another section of the tape there is a code $E_\alpha$ for $(L_\alpha, \in)$ (meaning that $(\omega, E_\alpha) \cong (L_\alpha, \in)$). Because we are below $\Sigma$, (uniformly) recursive in the $\Sigma_2$-theory of $(L_\alpha, \in)$ is a wellorder of order-type $\alpha$. This leads to: Corollary If a limit $\alpha$ is clockable, then a code for $\alpha$ is writable by time $\alpha + \omega$ (just add on the extra steps to write out (a code for) the wellorder). With some more fiddling around and consideration of cases that ``$+\,\omega$'' can be removed, and also for successor cases... The theorem appears in: S-D Friedman & P.D. Welch Two Observations concerning Infinite Time Turing Machines, in Bonn International Workshop on Ordinal Computability, Ed: I. Dmitriou, J. Hamkins & P. Koepke, 2007, Bonn, 44-48. $URL$ There the theorem is proven for the Jensen $J_\alpha$ hierarchy, but with work it can be done for the $L_\alpha$'s too. 

I agree with the last sentence of Bill Mitchell's comment. But here is something closer than the cardinals mentioned. In [1] the notion of "almost Ramsey" cardinal was coined. Such a cardinal $\kappa$ is required to be $\alpha$-Erdos for all $\alpha<\kappa$. Then $V_\kappa$ is a model of what you are after (but in fact this is still not exact as there are many other $\gamma <\kappa$ for which this is true too. Almost Ramseys also get an outing in [2]. If you are interested in sharps alone, then, eg just for sharps for reals, $\kappa \rightarrow (\omega_1)^{<\omega}_{2}$ is already overkill: one really just needs for any function $f$ homogeneous sets of arbitrarily large but countable length, all of which have the same "type". This has been investigated closely in [3]. Similar considerations would hold for sharps of other sets of ordinals. The least inner model in which every set has a sharp, $L^\#$ say, is too thin to contain any Erdos cardinals (other than trivially $\kappa(\delta)$ for $\delta< \omega_1^{L^\#}$). [1] J.

I should have answered the question much like Joel's - if it had not been on hold! I should have added though that Barnaby Dawson should be credited, independently and perhaps slightly earlier than Peter Koepke, with the idea of running Turing machines along On-length tapes. He formulated a method of writing characteristic functions of sets as 0,1 streams on an output tape. He formulated the "Axiom of Computability" that all sets are outputs on a tape of such a machine. He moreover noticed that a program forever producing sets coding reals say would act in a certain pattern of repetition, and if produced in an infinitely long computation could be produced in one of countable length (in other words the Continuum Hypothesis holds for "Computable Sets"). The global wellordering of such sets is trivial - so to cut the story short what was constructed were the constructible sets of Goedel's $L$. (This was all written out a few years later in his - unpublished - PhD thesis.) One point in answer to the original question, is that the construction of any such machine, whether Turing Machines on long tapes, or ordinal register machines working on ordinals, is that they could never in any sense ``decide'' whether $V=L$, since by their very nature their operations are absolute to the $L$-hierarchy: running them in $V$ yields the same course of computations as running them in $L$. (What kind of 'computation' could it be that was not so absolute?) So without external oracle input say, as Joel points out, they will never produce anything beyond $L$. The remarkable result is that they nevertheless produce all the constructible sets. In one sense this was to be expected (at least for the Turing machine model): the original Hamkins-Kidder machines were known to compute (codes for) all levels of the $L$-hierarchy up to a certain level. This was only hampered by the $\omega$-length of their tape. Thus if you give them $On$-length of scratch/output tape, then there would be no stopping them! As an additional reference there is a survey article Transfinite Machine Models in Turing's Legacy Lecture Notes in Logic vol 42, Ed. R. Downey, CUP; Apr. 2014. 

(I don't know if this is Abraham's reasoning.) Let us write $\omega_1$ for $\omega_1^L$ throughout. Suppose for a contradiction the assumptions hold but that $L[A,B]$ has nonconstructible reals. 1) First note that the answer is easy if both $A,B \subseteq \omega_1$:for then for some $\alpha < \omega_1$ $L_\alpha[A\cap\alpha, B\cap \alpha]$ has a non-constructible real by Lowenheim Skolem. But the latter structure is in $L$, which is absurd. 2) Otherwise: first generically (possibly class-generically) extend $L[A,B]$ to a GCH model $L[A,B][G]$ followed by a Jensen style coding to code $A,B,G$ by some $H\subseteq \omega_1$: we then have $L[A,B,G][H]\models $ ``$V=L[H]$''. Neither of these forcings add reals (being $\omega$-distributive). However by our assumptions $L[H]$ has non-constructible reals; but now we are in the situation of part 1) and get a contradiction as before. 

It does not have any particular name or notation: it is just ''the height of the minimal model of set theory'' 

The main deficit of KF over KP is that one cannot prove that the set of formulae equivalent to a $\Sigma_1$ or $\Pi_1$ formula is closed under bounded quantification. (And this persists up through the $KF_n/KP_n$ you define.) Therefore recursions involving schemes defined by a formula of the form $\forall u \in v \varphi$ cannot in general be effected in KF. At the level n=1: Mathias in: ``Weak Systems of Gandy, Jensen and Devlin'', (Trends in Mathematics, Ed. Bagaria, Todorcevic, BirkhÃ¤user Press) states that methods of Zarach should be sufficient to give an example showing that $\Delta_0$-collection cannot be substituted by $\Delta_0$-replacement, but does not give an example (and I don't have one). At levels > 1: See Gitman, Johnstone, Hamkins ``What is the theory ZFC without Power Set". (Archive for Math.Logic, 2012) where they give examples (some derived from Zarach) of failures of even low levels of $\Sigma_n$-Collection even in models of full $\Sigma_\omega$-Replacement. They observe that one can inductively define in one such model a family of bijective functions $f:\omega \longrightarrow \aleph_k$ for $k\leq n$, but not altogether for all $n<\omega$. Thus strengthening the replacement scheme does not help. 

If I understand you correctly I believe the answer is no. Let $S(x)$ be the rud. function that returns $x \cup \{x\}$. Let $R(x,y) \leftrightarrow y = S(x)$. Then $F(x) = \{y\mid R(x,y)\} = \{S(x)\}$ is rud. But $G(x)=\{y\mid R^+(x,y)\}\supseteq \{y \mid \exists p<\omega\,\, y = SS...SS(x)\, (p \mbox{ times }) \}$. However then there is no $q$ so that $\forall x : rk(G(x))\leq rk(x)+q$. Hence $G$ cannot be rud. 

"Every set is really climbable": this contradicts AC. By AC construct a set $X\subseteq \omega_1$ such that $L[X]\models $"$\omega_1 =\omega_1^V$". Then for arbitrarily large $\gamma < \omega_1$ we have that $L_\gamma[X\cap \gamma] \models $"Every set is countable". But such a set cannot be climbable, for if $f\in L[r]$ were a 'climbing' function, according to the definition we should have such $X\cap \gamma \in dom(f) \subset L[r]$ contradicting the inaccessibility of $\omega^V_1$ there. On the other hand, assuming $AD$, for example in $L({R})$ assuming large cardinals (where also DC holds - but that is not relevant), by an early result of Solovay, every subset of $\omega_1$ is in some $L[r]$ for a real $r$; clearly then every such subset is really, and trivially, climbable. 

Call $\alpha\in On$ p.r.closed, if every p.r. set function $f$ is total on $L_{\alpha}$. (Note (1) If $\alpha^\ast$ is the least p.r. closed ordinal $> \alpha$ then it is the next image of a point in the $\omega$'th Veblen function, so in any case is much smaller than the next admissible. Hence (2) the p.r.closed ordinals form a c.u.b. class, and in fact are c.u.b. below any admissible ordinal $>\omega$. (3) By Jensen-Karp [1] the p.r. functions on ordinals to ordinals are all the restrictions of the p.r. set functions to $On$. Hence it is easier to reason with the latter class.) Definition Let $\delta$ be p.r. reflecting if for all p.r. functions $F:On\rightarrow On$, if $F(\delta)\neq 0$ then $\exists \alpha < \delta (F(\alpha)\neq 0 )$. Then Claim $\delta$ not p.r. reflecting iff $\delta$ is p.r. recognizable. Now let $\beta$ be the least p.r. closed ordinal with a $\beta_0<\beta$ satisfying $L_{\beta_0}\prec_{\Sigma_1}L_\beta$. (So larger than the least $\Pi^1_0$-reflecting ordinal, but less than the least $\Pi^1_1$-reflecting ordinal.) By p.r. closure, and $\Sigma_1$-elementarity, the totality of the p.r. functions on $L_\beta$ ensures: Lemma The least p.r. reflecting ordinal is less than or equal to $\beta_0$. This gives an upper bound to the first p.r. reflecting, and so non-p.r. recognizable, ordinal, and will answer the first part of the Extra Quest. negatively, as we shall see below there are p.r. recognisable ordinals $>\beta$. As an imprecise lower bound one can take the least $\Pi^1_0$-reflecting ordinal mentioned above. [Edit: This is fully answered below at (C).] (If $\gamma$ is this ordinal, and so we have $L_\gamma \prec_{\Sigma_1}L_{\gamma +1}$, it is easy to see all ordinals $\tau < \gamma$ are p.r. recog. as for any such $\tau$ there is some sentence $B$ so that $L_\tau$ is the least level of the $L$-hierarchy where $B$ is true. But $\gamma+1$ is itself p.r. recog. as the first $\tau$ where $L_\tau$ has a proper $\Sigma_1$-substructure, etc., etc. (This answers the second part of the original Question) Similar statements hold for larger stretches of the ordinals $[0,\gamma']$ for $\gamma + 1 < \gamma'$.) To find the least upper bound of the p.r. recog. ordinals, one can reason as follows: If the $\Sigma_1$ sentence $A$ is first true at some stage $L_{\delta}$, then $\delta$ is p.r. recog. Consequently the p.r. recog. ordinals will be cofinal in $\sigma_1$ the least $\Sigma_1$-stable ordinal, i.e. the least ordinal with $L_{\sigma}\prec_{\Sigma_1}V $ (as new $\Sigma_1$-sentences become true cofinally in $\sigma_1$). Thus for example if $\delta$ is least so that $L_\delta$ is a $ZF^-$ model, it will be p.r. recog. Note then that no ordinal $\geq \sigma_1$ can be p.r.recongizable, as otherwise this would be a new $\Sigma_1$ fact true at a stage beyond $\sigma_1$. Thus: Lemma The supremum of the p.r. recognisable ordinals is $\sigma_1$. If $\tau_0$ is the least p.r. reflecting ordinal, and $\tau >\tau_0$ the least p.r. closed ordinal above that, then the answer to the second question of the Extra Question, is to take $\tau +1$. The $\Sigma_1$ statement that "there exists such a pair $\tau_0<\tau$ " can be used to recognise this ordinal. Comment: if the definition of recognizable is adjusted (call it recognizable*) so that $\alpha$ is recognizable* if for some p.r. function $F$, $F$ is everywhere $0$ except that for some (unique) $\tau$ $F(\tau)=\alpha$, (and thus $\alpha$ is the sole non-zero value that $F$ takes) then the recognizable* ordinals are precisely those $< \sigma_1$.
