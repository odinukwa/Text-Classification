By comparison, the luminosity of the sun is $\sim10^{26}\text{ W}$. This sort of event is brief but very violent. I don't know what the long-term effects of this radiation will be for the planet, but short-term, it won't be pleasant. The deposition of radioactive isotopes might also be a problem, but I don't know just how bad it would be. 

Now, one thing you could do is lower the activity of the central star. The Sun blocks GCRs during coronal mass ejections and similar eruptions, leading to something called a Forbush decrease,[5] which is simply when fewer GCRs reach Earth. We also see modulations in the GCR flux during the Sun's 11 year cycle of activity. The latter leads to changes in flux of around 10-20%, at is peak. However, keep in mind that this is measured from a baseline level of activity; reduce stellar events (coronal mass ejections, stellar flares, long-term fluctuations, etc.) significantly, and you could really make an impact. Therefore, I have two proposals to make: 

I was planning a short story that focuses on a rainy day in a city, and I realized that there's one interesting feature of it: Even though the weather seems bleak, and it affects the actions of those in the story, anyone reading it knows that the next day will be, in all probability, sunny, bringing a lighter mood to the city.1 But what if the next day wasn't sunny? What if it rains then? And the next day, and the next day, and the next day? What if it were to rain forever? I'm trying to figure out how I can make an earth-like world - very Earth-like world - support a weather system that continuously rains everywhere on the planet. there are some issues with this: 

I have one major point to make: A good portion of Jupiter does not complete one rotation in 9.8 hours. Jupiter isn't like a giant ball of rock. It's called as "gas giant" for a reason, which is that it has a large, massive, turbulent atmosphere that's constantly moving and changing. This means that its atmosphere undergoes differential rotation, a phenomenon in which gases at different heights move at different speeds. So "9.8 hours" refers to the lower gaseous layers and inner structure. The major change that would happen if Jupiter had a longer day would be that its equatorial bulge would shrink. This is best explained by the classic ice skater analogy: A rotating object with a greater radius will have a smaller angular velocity, and vice versa. So if Jupiter rotates faster, the bulge will shrink. I'm not up for doing much math, but we can use some modified equations to give a rough approximation (I won't plug any numbers in; you can do that, if you want). Anyway, we can relate the equatorial radius to the polar radius using the equation $$\frac{a_e-a_p}{a}=\frac{5 \omega^2 a^3}{4GM} \to a_e = \frac{5 \omega^2 a^4}{4GM}+a_p$$ where the variables are given on the Wikipedia page. Having a rotational period of 9.8 hours (35280 seconds) gives us an angular velocity $\omega$ of $0.000178 \text{ radians/second}$. A period of 24 hours gives us an angular velocity of $0.000073 \text{ radians/second}$ - a mere 40.83% of the previous period. That means that the equation is now more like $$a_e = \left( \frac{2}{5} \right)^2 \frac{5 \omega^2_0 a^4}{4GM}+a_p$$ which is a bit smaller than before. Note, though, that this isn't going to be wholly accurate, as I didn't take differential rotation into account. 

Use a chain of ships. I'm imagining a pyramid setup, in a sense. Take $n$ ships. Send out the first one, of relatively low mass - Ship $1$. Then send out Ship $2$. Ship $2$ is now directly propelled by the laser on the base, and it in turn is propelled Ship $1$. Repeat by launching Ship $3$ to power Ship $2$, and so on until you launch Ship $n$. The thing here is that you end up using more power than you would if you simply launched each ship one-by-one, powered by the laser. If you gave each ship the same power, then only the very first ship would travel onwards, propelled like normal. However, you've solved the problem. You're only limited by energy, not by the number of railways. Things to watch out for: 

The Coriolis acceleration is $$\mathbf{a}_c=-2\mathbf{\Omega}\times\mathbf{v}$$ where $\mathbf{\Omega}$ is the angular velocity vector of the cylinder and $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity vector of the river. $\mathbf{\Omega}$ is along the axis of rotation of the cylinder. Let's look at two cases: 

Giant planets relatively close to the central star (but beyond the frost line) will accrete large quantities of hydrogen and helium, which were the major components of the initial gas and dust that surrounded the Sun when it first formed. These planets are massive enough that it is simple for them to retain their atmospheres of these light gases. However, less massive planets (such as the terrestrial planets) will lose any initial hydrogen and helium envelopes via atmospheric escape. The only planets that can possibly retain these gases are the most massive giant planets, which then amass enormous atmospheres. On these planets, there is no possibility of having an Earth-like atmosphere. Planets further out can have interesting compositions.1 If you move far enough away from the central star, ice giants can forms. Uranus and Neptune are examples (they are not, technically, gas giants). These giant planets are composed of heavier elements than hydrogen and helium - ices, which may include oxygen, methane, sulfur and nitrogen. They also, however, have hydrogen and helium, which, though composing much of their volume, only contribute about 1/5 of their total mass. Ice giants are better targets for the kind of atmosphere you want. The issue, though, is that the oxygen and nitrogen you want may be in solid form, and even if some of it is gaseous, there's still a large atmosphere of hydrogen and helium to deal with. The good thing is that exoplanets are not just either terrestrial planets or gas/ice giants. There are several intermediate classes that could help you: 

I think that the former is the better option, because underwater vehicles require storage, and if they're just used for crossing a body of water, they're not very economical. 

Hereâ€™s the code I used to do the calculations and generate the plots (although you can play around with various parameters, like black hole mass and total cluster mass): 

I don't think that there would be a huge change in expense among the different ideas. You need to have $X$ dollars/pesos/pounds/yen/euros to maintain a station of a given surface area. Unfortunately, all of these stations that have artificial gravity need to have the same surface area, so this isn't going to change. 

The water quality can vary by region. For example, this map of nitrate concentration in the High Plains (from (Gurdak et al. (2009)) varies widely, do to agricultural use and other sources. Location is everything when it comes to water quality. 

Building from scratch weather.gov gives three cases where lightning can suddenly become more intense or common in an area: 

A second solution might be to use a shielding gas. This is commonly used in industrial welding to absorb some heat from welding lasers. I have absolutely no idea if it could work. You would likely need to rig up a magnetic field to contain it (if possible), and it would obscure visible light. But it might be better than nothing. 

In a story I'm working on, a rogue nation-state has decided to attack another country. They want to make the attack seem more natural, though, and so they've decided to trigger an earthquake. This nation-state has access to quite a lot of funds, and has bought weapons from a number of arms dealers; their arsenal somewhat resembles that of the Canadian Armed Forces. That said, they have short-range ballistic missiles, and a decent air force. Other countries, of course are not happy with this, and have threatened to retaliate if this nation uses any of their weapons. This is why the leaders of this country want to attack indirectly, so they can try to deny any responsibility for the disaster. They're willing to use any weapons they have, with the exception of nuclear weapons, because they don't have any. They have a lot of conventional explosives, but not nuclear capability, or the chance to develop any. Essentially, given a strong military, is there a way for this country to trigger seismic activity of some sort that could be felt by people in nations a few thousand miles away? It doesn't have to be targeted anywhere in particular; it just has to happen. If so, how strong an earthquake can they produce?
