Defining goals is important, if your goal is to build muscle for either strength or aesthetic then you need to start lifting weights as the majority of your fitness sessions. If you have concerns or questions about lifting weights search for an answer here or ask the question! 

Calculate your approximate calorie and macronutrient needs. Make a list of foods and recipes that you already know that you like. Use Google or reddit's r/Fitmeals to find additional ideas. Use resources like MyFitnessPal and nutritional labels at the grocery store to calculate the nutritional content of the foods from Step 2. If you're trying to do this on a budget, this is also a good time to calculate the cost of each food. Arrange your foods and recipes until your calorie and macronutrient needs from Step 1 are met. A common way of doing this is the "If It Meets Your Macros" or "flexible dieting" method. Enjoy your delicious food. 

This is one of those you can prove by example. The book is right, what it refers to is "conditioning" which is a method by which you increase your aerobic capacity to enable you to workout for a short interval and a very high intensity. This is not immediately obvious for someone who spends time either learning movements or doing reps and sets at the gym. 4 minutes is a long time to be moving your entire body for, especially whilst doing controlled breathing. You can see at the Olympics that athletes are breathing heavily after a rings performance. To try it for yourself: Do 4 minutes of burpees. Go at a comfortably slow pace (1 every 2-3 seconds) and try to keep that pace for the entirety. The movements aren't the same as the rings but the process is. You are moving reasonably slowly but because your entire body is being used you need more oxygen, your breathing increases. 

Yoga gives transferable fitness: here is a controversial "opinion": Yoga ONLY makes you good at similar yoga-based activities, eg. muscle stabilization (balance) and mindfulness (There are some others but the studies are a bit wishy-washy). Yoga does not mean you are able to run a mile/5k/10k/marathon in a good time. In the same way that me being able to lift X weight does not mean I can easily swim a mile. *Note: This doesn't hold true for all sports; a person with a sub 20 minute 5k time will probably be able to cycle 20k in a pretty good time. Use your brain.* Injury, that isn't: Only by doing exercise, regularly, consistently, and most importantly: listening to your body and PUSHING YOUSELF can you make any progress at anything. You need to go do some exercise and learn how to listen to your body to understand how far you can push yourself. Don't focus on the micro and lose sight of what you must do to achieve your goals. 

To me, that is a relatively low level of working out, to actively build muscle and use the protein from your diet you should be working out for 45-60 minutes at least 3 days a week, potentially more (depending on your exercises). If you can describe your workout in detail I could give you more pointers as to whether it should be working or not (for your goals) and why. You should be working to progressive overload. Side Note: Your sets-reps are more suited to a Sarcoplasmic style of hypertrophy with high volume which is suited to the bodybuilder style which is as opposed to the powerlifting style linked with myofibrillar hypertrophy. Strength training typically produces a combination of the two different types of hypertrophy: low-rep, high weight causes myofibrillated hypertrophy to dominate whereas several repetitions (generally 8â€“12 for bodybuilding or 12 or more for muscular endurance) against a less weight leads to more sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. IF your end-game is being able to look good you should aim for sarcoplasmic hypertrophy but if your aim is to be strong, myofibrillated hypertrophy is for you. Next, 

Since you have a good understanding of creatine and assuming your diet is unchanged during your holiday, you will have a reduction (possibly to baseline) of water retention. To get the full effect of taking creatine you should keep taking it during your break as once you get back you will be loaded and ready to utilise its benefits in the gym. Otherwise you will need to wait for your body to build up its level as you either load or take normal dose. If you don't take creating during your break your levels will drop. As a basic understanding of what creatine is will tell you, you don't need to cycle creatine. And arguably you do not need to load creatine either. In terms of muscle mass preservation (understanding that you may retain less water and so cycling off creatine will cause you to lose weight) A study found no loss in strength or lean tissue mass when you stop taking creatine. Bottom line, its up to you. You will probably end up cycling off if you take a break but it wont really impact your life in the marco unless you are aiming to set some PB's straight after your holiday break. 

I'll be honest. When I am working out at the gym I do look around at other people doing their workouts. I mentally-applaud the new people I haven't seen before, especially if there is someone who is just starting what is obviously 5x5 or Starting Strength programs. I also mentally-cuss those who are ego lifting (or generally being annoying/disrespectful) or doing dangerous exercises. The reality of it is that nearly-everyone at the gym started at one point like you. They all started with the bar and had their sticking points and failed reps. Most people will occasionally glance around between sets but don't really care what you are doing unless its dangerous. 

Biceps are 1, small muscle. Growing strength and size in that muscle after noob gains have passed is a lot slower than legs because there is simply more muscle mass on your legs to grow. The same goes for shoulders, If I could add 2.5kg onto my overhead press for 6 weeks on the trot, I would be at an Olympic level in a very sort amount of time. To combat the diffuclty in adding weight to bicep curls, I suggest weight-rep modification. For example: 

Nutrient Timing: For the majority of individuals this does not matter in the slightest, however with training so much you will need to make sure your body has access to the carbs it needs, to provide you with energy. For you carb timing is important and you should look to experiment with your carb timing and running to find out what works best for you. This is highly personal and is impossible for me to specify an appropriate time. As I have said previously...

The explanation is air-y fairy nonsence. The 'ailments' are just another way of describing DOMS: $URL$ 

This event requires you to be able to perform the 5 burpees as well.Failure penalty is 30 burpees. To practice for this I would suggest grabbing a big, heavy, awkward object (medicine ball works well) and trying to replicate the ~50ft there-and-back walk. Barbed Wire Crawl Does what it say on the tin, get on your belly and crawl under barbed wire. There is no failure penalty, you are disqualified if you cannot complete the obstacle. To practice this, build up to sets of 50ft bear/belly crawl. Bucket Brigade Take a standard (solid) garden bucket and fill it with gravel. Now carry that gravel around a course (there will be a hill/slope) and back without putting it on your shoulders, head or neck. If you fail the obstacle you keep repeating until you succeed. Practicing this is pretty easy if you have access to gravel and a bucket. Otherwise practice carrying weight in the "hug" position. Fire Jump Jump over the fire or do 30 burpees. This is a mental challenge more than anything, you won't catch alight so just take a quick running jump. Try not to kick the wall of fire (around a foot high). Not sure how you can practice this. Hurc Hoist A rope is attached to a weight and goes up and back down over a pully. You pull the rope to lift the weight up and then gently lower it back down. The weight is not insignificant. Penalty for failure or dropping the weight is 30 burpees. Practice by doing pulling movements in the gym any movement where you pull weight downward will be useful: lat pulldowns or pull ups or a similar machine. Over and Thru You jump over the wall, crawl under the second then pull yourself thru the third wall. A local park may have obstacles that are helpful there to practice the movements on. Otherwise, practicing pull ups to help with first wall will be helpful potentially. Penalty is 30 burpees. Rope Climb Start in a pool of mud and climb 16ft up a rope already covered in mud to ring a bell. This is really hard. It required a technique to ensure you can hook and use your feet and it requires a lot of strength to hoist yourself up. Being on the lighter side of bodyweight so that your power-to-weight ration is good would help too. As with a lot of the previous exercises, the failure penalty is 30 burpees and the best way to practice would be pull-ups and actually practicing the movement on a rope (your local crossfit gym might be able to help). Spear Throw This one is a bit of a gimmick, you throw a spear at a target. Sounds easy? WRONG. This is actually very difficult to do technically well and you have to throw the spear very hard and very accurately. Penalty (most fail) is 30 burpees. Look up technique videos and start throwing sticks. Transverse Wall You work your way round a makeshift climbing wall sideways. Faster is better as your grip wont get tired. Practice by doing this at a local climbing centre in their bouldering area. Penalty is 30 burpees. Tyrolean Traverse This is as hard, if not harder, than the rope climb. A rope is stretched out over a body of water and you pull yourself along it to ring a bell at the end. Then you drop into the water and swim to the end. Practice: Make sure you can swim a length or two comfortably. At this stage you will be tired so the swim should not be the obstacle. Heck if I know how to practice the movement of crawling along a rope. This is a very hard movement. Being able to move your bodyweight and remain balanced is key. Penalty is 30 burpees. Wall Jump Jump over a wall. Practice this by jumping squats, jumping, pulling yourself up. A park near you might have a wall for practicing on. Pull ups are helpful. Penalty is 30 burpees. Summary A bit of maths, at 20(+) obstacles with a standard of 30 burpees on each fail you could have to complete 500 burpees over the course of the run. The run is not timed and you may be able to complete the obstacles and thus prevent yourself having to do the burpees but be prepared for around 90-250 "level 5" burpees on the day. I'd recommend doing level '5' burpees as soon as possible, building up to being able to complete 5-8 sets of 40 repetitions. Build it into workouts such as: 

Your body adapts to whatever you are doing. If your job involves cutting up vegetables then your mind learns the movements required and over time improves the speed and efficiency with which you can complete the task until it becomes a subconscious level of response. This is discussed in "What is Reality" in reasonable detail and in this interview with a cup stacker. Part of that learning process when completing a task is that your muscles are also adapting to be good at the task. Fast twitch growth is nurtured if you do lots of "explosive" exercises and slow twitch if you do more aerobic-style exercises like long distance running. The upshot of all of this is that: Your body will adapt to be better at whatever you are doing the most. If you run all the time, your body will get efficient at running, same for cycling, fishing, weightlifting, swimming etc. I would be careful with taking fitness facts from anyone who is a "expert", make sure you fact check their comments before taking them as complete truth. Onto your main question: What does road biking do to improve your running? Road biking predominately develops your leg muscle groups due to the constant resistance of pedalling and will improve your general fitness (reducing resting heart rate, improving muscle endurance etc.) Both of these can help with running. Road biking can improve your understanding of how to push your body and how to manage your fatigue, both of which are important for running. 

Injury: If you have a injury then you should ask ONLY your doctor what you can do and they can advice you on specific sporting activities. There is no point asking here on SE if you can run/walk/cycle/swim/juggle with your dodgy knee/foot/hip/lungs/balls. Fitness you have previously done: Unless you have been active in doing your activity in the last 6 weeks, assume you have lost a significant amount of fitness level over that time compared to your previous peak. It is wrong to assume that because you ran a marathon when you were 23 that now you are 48 you can do a few weeks/months training and run a ultra-marathon. 

Congrats, you got Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS for short). You are fine. If you warm up before exercising again your should have more blood pumping around your muscles and it will go away. After a few sessions you should not get them any more. DOMS take 24-72 hours before they hit sometimes. 

To answer the valid question here: Does Creatine cause bloating? Yes, the water retention usually seen with higher (>10g) loading doses can exceed five pounds (more than two kilograms). Lower doses may cause less water retention. While water mass is not muscle mass (though both count as lean mass), prolonged creatine supplementation is met with an increased rate of muscle growth. $URL$ Do you need to load creatine? No. $URL$ However: you are retaining more water, not more fat. Your weight is going up as a result of supplementing creatine increasing water retention but that weight is not fat. Some bodybuilders cycle off creatine for competitions but it varies from person-to-person. Note: Some body-fat measuring scales (using electrical resistance) which claim to tell you your body-fat percentage are affected massively by your hydration/water level. Taking creatine may make it read falsely that your body-fat has gone up.
