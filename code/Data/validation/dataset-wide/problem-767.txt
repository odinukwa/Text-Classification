Not really. Quasars do indeed need a SMBH to be powered, and this is a necessary condition. But, Quasar phase only lasts for tens millions to few billions years. This means that, in a more recent universe, Quasars are turned off but the host galaxy... is still there. And the SMBH also do. This is exactly as our Galaxy case ($Sgr A^*$), where the evidences for the presence of a SMBH are among the strongest ones, but still no nuclear activity is present. However, there are tons of study to infer the proper amount of AGNs in the whole Universe by using luminosity functions. 

I don't see any reason why dark matter couldn't be considered a medium just as air or water are, but this does not mean that your conclusion is correct. Dark matter does not interact with photons, however the reason we know dark matter exists is because of the measurable effect of its gravity. Galaxies have a tendency to clump around it. Light travels unimpeded at its standard rate between galaxies where we don't detect any dark matter, so interesting question though it is, I'm afraid the answer is no. 

Both articles mention MIDAS (the Moon Impacts Detection and Analysis System). Since the first link is from 2006, perhaps soon we will have a good estimate for you. 

You can upload your FITS files to astrometry.net (or use an API) and get the coordinates. You can optionally get new FITS files back with the coordinates included in the metadata. From there you will be able to proceed with your processing. And, instead of uploading everything, you can also install a copy of the astrometry.net package locally if you're running Linux. 

Solar telescopes typically have filters to reduce the amount of light reaching their detector. Depending on their purpose they may use, for example, neutral density filters to reduce the amount of light to a level where they can resolve details without blocking any of the visible spectrum, hydrogen alpha filters to observe the Sun at a wavelength of 656 nanometres for observing features in the Sun's atmosphere such as solar prominences and the chromosphere, or blocking the solar disc to observe the Sun's corona, flares and other ejecta. Hubble, on the other hand, is designed with a very different purpose in mind such as taking long-exposure images to obtain the deep- and ultra-deep field full spectrum images. It avoids the Sun as even a very short exposure to the Sun would damage its instruments. 

Yes. You would have to wait 4.5 billion years to see the observer at point A looking back at you through his telescope. You would now be looking at a cooling hunk of molten rock with no moon or oceans. No. If you waited 4.5 billion years and saw Observer A, he would have been dead for 4.5 billion years by the time you see him. In fact, his Sun would likely be expanding to the point of burning his planet to a cinder if not engulfing it entirely. But of course, you would have to wait another 4.5 billion years to see that. You would be observing the photons that bounced off Observer A all that time ago and have been traveling ever since. It is important to note that this is not him, and does not mean he still exists. 

The Sun will be at your zenith a few days after 21st March, after it crosses the equator heading northwards* going towards summer, and a few days before 21st September, before it crosses the equator heading southwards* after summer has ended. * from an Earth-centric viewpoint. We know, of course, that the Earth is rotating about its axis and revolving about the Sun, and that Earth's axial tilt is what causes the seasons and the apparent motion of the Sun across the sky both through the day and through the seasons. 

They do use two or more detectors to triangulate the origin of a source. Most recently the Advanced Virgo detector in Italy was used in conjunction with the two LIGO detectors in the USA. This has been published in Physical Review Letters (Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 141101 – Published 6 October 2017). With two detectors the sky area for "pinpointing" the source is quite a large area, but with three detectors the area is reduced by a factor of about 20. 

Have 2 people stand in opposite corners of a large empty room each with a jar of marbles. Have them roll these at each other all at once as fast as they can, and you will get a pretty good answer to your question. 97% (or thereabouts) of a given galaxy is empty space. Most of one is going to pass harmlessly through the other, though you are likely to get a few collisions. At or near the speed of light, gravity will have very little effect as well, so a few orbits will be perturbed, but any given star will hardly notice. I suspect (though I haven't the expertise to say definitively) that the radiation increase during the ~100,000 years or more that this collision would take (assuming the galaxies were of approximately the size of the Milky Way and that they hit exactly edge on) would be significant to any creatures living in your galaxies. If by the off chance (I'm talking about lightning-striking-a-shark-currently-eating-a-recent-lottery-winner kind of chance) the supermassive black holes at the center of these two galaxies collided, the speed would be no obstacle, and they would combine. The angular momentum would certainly rip the new black hole from one of, or likely both, of the colliding galaxies. This would be bad for them. I propose sending this as a "What If?" question to XKCD. He seems to have the time to do the math on questions of this nature and follow as far as it leads. 

From this book it seems you can have $\epsilon_{core}$ values raging from ~$30\%$ (a low value) up to $70\%$ (which is more "usual", i.e., requested by theories). More information can be found here and here. 

I am not expert of GRBs, but this high-oscillation behavior seems a characteristics of GRBs: you can see few examples here. In fact, the BAT time resolution is very high ($\sim100\mu s$), then you can resolve very tiny details of the source's timing event. About the source variability, this is something more theoretical (so I can not be of much help), and there is no accepted theory, but qualitatively, in some models the gamma rays are produced by clumpy clouds of relativistically ejected material, which could account for the high variability indeed.

Let me see if I can ask a different question that will help you understand why these other answers are correct. If you weigh yourself at night (when the Earth's gravity and the Sun's gravity are pulling in the same direction), do you weigh significantly more than you do during the day (when the Sun would be 'pulling you up'? The answer is no, because the Sun doesn't have a noticeable effect on your weight. If the Earth suddenly stopped rotating around its axis, everything not nailed to the Earth would get flung West at about 1000 mph including you and your scale. But a 150 lb human would still weigh 150 lbs as they splattered against the nearest building/mountain. If the Earth suddenly stopped revolving around the Sun, anything on the leading hemisphere would launch off the Earth at roughly 67,000 mph (well above escape velocity), and this includes things like oceans and atmosphere. Anything on the trailing side would simply smash into the ground at 67,000 mph, effectively burying the goo that used to be you miles underground. Worse things would happen as well, such as the Earth's molten core erupting through the crust, etc., but no one would be alive long enough to lament it. But just as your mass doesn't change when you go on a trampoline, it wouldn't change based on the Earth's rotation or revolution. Notice I said mass this time and not weight. If you had presence of mind during your last fleeting moments to hold your trusty scale under your feet, it would probably register '0', but that is because of your momentum, not because of the gravitational interaction between you and the Earth, which is what we call weight. You would still be 150 pounds, you would just be a 150 pound pile of goo somewhere unexpected. 

You are forgetting parallax. Something which is very distant and lies on the celestial equator will have a declination of 0°, but if it is nearby then its declination will only be 0° to an observer located along Earth's equator. From your location in Zagreb, something like the ISS, even if it is crossing Earth's equator at a longitude of ~16° will appear to be in the southern sky, and your declination coordinate will likely be south of 0°. 

Galaxies are oriented in different directions, if we consider the orientation to be relative to their central axis of rotation. Then when we consider things like galaxies and their "direction" of spin, we tend to orient them so that "up" is the direction that, when we look at them from "above", they rotate in an anticlockwise direction - the same as observing Earth's rotation looking down from the North Pole. We tend to use a "right-hand rule" for this rotation, so that when the direction of rotation matches the curl of the fingers on the right hand, the thumb points in the "up" direction. What this means is that every galaxy rotates the same way. On the smaller scale what we see is that things in systems tend to rotate in the same direction - looking "down from above" on our Solar System we see that the planets all revolve in the same direction around the Sun (anticlockwise). The vast majority of smaller bodies also revolve in this same direction. The Sun rotates in this same direction. And the planets themselves tend to rotate in the same direction (exceptions being Venus and Uranus). This is understandable as the accretion disc would have been rotating during Solar System formation. So yes, for the most part at least, as far as we have been able to determine, everything spins the same way within its own environment. 

Since it seems you don't know the equations, I will try to keep it simple. However, just keep in mind that, in principle, there is no difference between Galactic and extragalactic Cepheids, in this context. Now, we know that a Period-Luminosity relation holds for the Cepheids: $P\sim L$ Where $P$ is the pulsation period observed from the Cepheid, and $L$ is the observed luminosity. We also know that: $L\sim d$ where $d$ is the distance of the source. Then it is like to write $P\sim d$. This means that, if we observe the pulsation period of a Cepheid, we know its distance, and this allows to know the distance of the host galaxy as well. Some basic sources: Cepheid variable Classical Cepheid variable with some numbers And some diagrams too 

Hopefully this answers your question, though it doesn't have much to do with Special Relativity, it's still good blow-your-mind stuff. It's just speed of light stuff which we really knew and measured (albeit inaccurately) long before Einstein. 

Because the Drake equation has so many variables that have to be supplied out of whole cloth, there is no way that one can say it is accurate. As we learn more about the cosmos, we are getting a better range of values for some of those variables though. We know fairly accurately (read: within an order of magnitude) how many stars there are in the Milky Way. We are getting more refined estimates of what percentage of them have planets, and it is higher than anyone would have guessed previously (the highest estimate I saw before we started using doppler effects to find planets was 10%, but now we see ~22% of surveyed stars have planets). We also know that stars which have planets almost always have more than one. We also seem to find life pretty much everywhere we look on earth, but have still found none beyond our planet. Still, I think most educated guesses nowadays put this percentage in the 90-100% range. I think the better way to phrase this question is, is the Drake Equation a reasonable way of estimating the probability of finding intelligent life? Since 1961 when it was first proposed, have we found any reason to call into question any of the assumptions Dr. Drake made? I think it is reasonable. I think the greatest room for modification is in the definition of "technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space" and what signals we search for. But the variable itself is broad enough to encompass whatever we might come up with. One further variable might be added though: Percentage of likelihood that we would recognize an alien signal for what it is. EDIT: We could potentially find signs of life without receiving technologically created signals. During stellar transits we have the opportunity to examine the spectroscopy of their atmosphere and check for methane and other organic gasses that are unlikely to have formed without life, but I think we'll have to find life on Europa (where we know there is methane) before that test will be commonly accepted.
