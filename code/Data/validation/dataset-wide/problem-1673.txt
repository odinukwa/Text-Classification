The Hot-Plug-Detection feature is part of the HDMI protocol. All data-lines are quiet until a hotplug-event is detected via the physical pin 19. A handshake then negotiates a real connection: 

The paper BAKER, S. B., SWISHER, J. D., NADENICHEK, P. E. and POPOWICZ, C. L. (1984), Measured Effects of Primary Prevention Strategies conducted a meta-analysis on 40 primary prevention studies in the context of education. For evaluating the effectiveness they defined the Effect Size to be: $URL$ where ES is the Effective Size - means the benchmark how well prevention helped, X_t the "posttest mean of the treatment condition", X_c the "posttest mean of control condition" and SD_c the posttest standard deviation of the control condition. Their benchmark ist defined after Smith, Mary Lee, Gene V. Glass, and Thomas I. Miller. The benefits of psychotherapy. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980:

I found several other references at scholar.google.com using the keywords "poultry arsenic", however, on a first glance this looks like the most complete study I could find. 

If you want to decide whether President Obama is responsible, you have to look at what the responsiblity of a president entails. The US president swears an oath: 

Genetic engineering is a bit like cars. Humans always moved from place to place. Having cars allows us to go faster. That's both good and bad. It allows us to save time but also increases the accident rate. For a longer analysis the Long Now foundation hosted a high level debate about GMO with synthetic biology. 

From looking at the graph the year 1958 got a little bump but that year isn't very special for the usage of the word meritocracy. This means the claim by The Atlantic is false. 

The creative commons licensed 3D anatomy model BodyParts3D lists the volume for various bones. It lists for the left ulna 81.9 cm3 while it lists 73.3 cm3 for the right ulna. It lists for the left radius 88.0 cm3 while it lists 77.8 cm3 for the right radius. How good is the evidence that this general pattern exists, whereby people have more voluminous ulna and radius on the left side? 

Iridology claims that it's practitioners can diagnose various illnesses via looking at the eyes of patients. Is there evidence that supports or debunked their claims? 

In general the evidence that we have isn't good enough to come to a clear conclusion about whether patents are benefitial. Still there's are interesting observations about the real world effects of patents. We have a few real world examples of different industries that operate without patent protection. Those industries come in two kinds: 

If it continues uninterrupted there are two paths that they think it will take. One will miss earth by millions of kilometers and the other only has ~ a 1:300 chance of striking Earth. For a much more detailed description you can check out this NASA PDF detailing the probabilities of the DA 1950 collision. 

It appears that the higher your BAC the more features you can access, which is what makes the more interesting in my mind and also is what is going to make it controversial if it ever takes off. Sources: Engadget The Next Web EDIT: I have seen additional articles posted today that are much more skeptical of Livr, but none have conclusive proof that it is a hoax. The Network World article seems to be the only article that has gotten a response from either of the founders. 

His reply did not really confirm the existence of a real app, nor deny it. The founders are supposed to be speaking at SXSW today in Austin so once that happens more will be known. Until that happens no one can conclusively say if this is real or not. 

I'm leaving my original post as is below but from the above edit, you can see that the app is fake. ORIGINAL POST: It is real, or at least giving the impression of being a real app that is going to be released soon. From the Engadget article on it. 

The article then goes on the explain the transition of chess to Persia and then the transition to the Muslim world. 

Bruce Friedman writes on LabSoftNews in Finally, Some Important New Details about the Theranos Business Model: 

Some paranormalist such as Dean Radin advocate a hypothesis according to which the brain is like a radio: The brain receives information via the senses. It sends the information through some kind of telepathic medium to the soul which isn't "in the brain". The soul in turn uses the same telepathic medium sends commands back to the brain. The brain then redirect those commands to various parts of the body to get the body to act. fMRI measures brain activity indirectly through energy consumption. A radio that sends and receives commands does also consume energy. When parts of the brain get damaged through brain surgery the mind stops working. A radio also stops working and plays crude sounds when you damage it. At the present we don't have the ability to reconstruct a brain in a computer model to show that neuron activity is alone sufficient to explain the mind. At present we don't have evidence that let's us reject the radio hypothesis. We haven't found any evidence that supports it either. 

Is it true that the story that Arbesman and other tell about how the misplacement of a decimal point by Erich von Wolff lead to a popular misconception about the iron content of spinach is false? 

Is that a resonable description of the status quo? Is it that expensive to get new generics approved by the FDA? 

The vaccine that are commonly used do use adjuvants. Often that leads to adverse effects. The study that approved the Pandemrix® vaccine noted that the vaccine gave 21.5% of children between 6 and 9 headaches. When the vaccine was used under live condition in Germany for swine flu the general monitoring system wasn't sensitive enough to pick up the adverse effects. Given the fact that the general monitoring system isn't working we don't know about the real extend of the damage that the vaccine has done under live conditions. 

Since this conquest did not completely end until 651 and Muhammad died June 8, 632 AD, one could argue that chess was not brought to the Muslim world until 651, which is well after the death of Muhammad. However chess continued to develop until the 19th century when the bishop and queen were changed so they could move how they do now and several other rules of the game were changed. 

ADDITIONAL EDIT: Apparently Gizmodo has posted an updated article where they were able to confirm that this is a fake app and even tracked down the hoaxers. A quote by Brandon Bloch, one of the hoaxers, explaining it. 

It as been seen twice (1950 & 2001) and been able to record how it moved. We will see it again in 2032 and be able to more accurately calculate if it may hit or not. As of right now the uncertainty is caused by several things. 

App State law school Shooting. I'll sum this one up. It did involve an two students who were off duty officers, a county sheriff and a police officer. They confronted the man who had shot several people and he dropped his gun at that point and was subdued by several other students. This posting lists 2 of the events I have listed as well as two more. One did involve a former police officer. Most of these the shooter was stopped after someone was killed, but in this example, the shooters were stopped before anyone was killed.
