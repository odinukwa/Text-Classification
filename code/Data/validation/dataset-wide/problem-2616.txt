According to the Tittha Sutta, translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, the second and third noble truths are related to the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. 

Maybe? It becomes a little confusing trying to reconcile the Therevada four path model and the Mahayana bhumi model. The individual, after directly apprehending nibbana (becoming a stream-winner in the Therevada model), would just have to become a fully, self enlightened buddha within seven life times. One problem though is how can they be said to be fully self enlightened if they attained to a stage of enlightenment through a previous buddha's teachings. If you are talking about parinibbana then it seems to go against the Therevada understanding to say that one could enter into parinibbana and then later be reborn in order to become a buddha. The way you phrased this question though "So after he enters nirvana he can't accomplish what he wants to accomplish?" Implies that the individual won't be able to enter into parinibbana - since parinibbana is based on being free from wanting. By wanting to do other things the mind will incline toward a rebirth that allows for the fulfillment of those wants. I would think that someone who has taken the bodhisattva vow and truly aspires toward that goal would not be able to directly apprehend nibbana until their final human life. Subsequently becoming a fully, self enlightened buddha. 

When is the right time for seclusion? When is the wrong time for seclusion? How much time should be spent in seclusion? 

That sounds like the hindrance of "sloth-torpor". There are lots of ways to counter this. The Five Mental Hindrances and Their Conquest: Sloth 

Stream enterer: A stream-enterer reaches arahantship within seven rebirths upon opening the eye of the Dharma. 

In this video by Sayadaw U Nandasiri, if I am understanding him correctly, he equates appana samadhi and magga/phala enlightenment. Is this correct? I had understood momentary, access, and absorption to be referring to jhana. Do they also refer to magga/phala? Or are they one in the same? 

After abandoning the five hindrances work on vipassana. Some days you may use your entire meditation working on calming and removing the five hindrances through single point meditation. 

Arahant: The fourth stage is that of Arahant, a fully awakened person. He has abandoned all ten fetters and, upon death will never be reborn in any plane or world, having wholly escaped saṃsāra. 

If you master it you will be able to enter and exit it at will. Getting stuck in it is not uncommon. The same goes for choosing to stay in it because it is pleasant, which is seen as a hindrance to final liberation. Speaking the dhamma or keeping 'noble silence' is also part of the Jhanic experience. This sounds similar to what you described. You struggled to talk about work but once you were able to share your experience you could not stop talking. Fighting against our lifelong programming, like you described, can make this experience seem negative. If you want to keep trying to master Jhana, while still continuing to work and continuing to fit in nicely with society, I recommend finding a teacher. Otherwise you might continue to experience this state for extended periods while attempting to master it. 

According to the Maha-Assapura Sutta translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, a practitioner works on The Three Knowledges, one of which is recollection of past lives, after obtaining all four Jhanas.. 

Samatha calms the mind and its formations. This leads the practitioner to abandoning the five hindrances. Just note that your mind has wandered as soon as you realize it has happened. With enough practice you will immediately recognize when the mind has wandered to one of the five hindrances. With even more practice the mind will stop wandering. Eventually a practitioner will develop Jhana, the culmination of samatha practice, where they can attain a tranquil state instantly. It just takes practice and patience. 

Just because things are accepted as truth does not necessarily mean that they are. As the Buddha would say, figure it out for your self, do not rely on others to give you the answers. Since I am not liberated, and I do not believe you claim to be, it is hard for either of us to know who actually is other than the Buddha himself; this is meant to emphasize the Buddha's idea that we should figure things out for ourselves. An argument could be made that given science is willing to admit mistakes that it is a better source. 

Don't think. Transcend thinking. That is the way. edit: Venerable Chong An Sunim explains there are different ways to approach koans. His suggestion is to do regular meditation (e.g., mindfulness of breathing). Sometime later, either while meditating, or just in everyday life, you will have an epiphany in regards to the true meaning of the koan. 

Are there differences between a person who progresses through insight while looking for the different stages and someone who progresses through insight ignorant of the stages? What are the pros and cons of each approach? 

Is earth the ideal condition to achieve Nirvana; advanced enough for a being to discover and teach the universal truth of reality but not so advanced that beings won't care enough to strive for it? 

Once-returner: Both the stream-enterer and the once-returner have abandoned the first three fetters. The stream-enterer and once-returner are distinguished by the fact that the once-returner has weakened lust, hate, and delusion to a greater degree. 

If, during your formal practice, you are able to purify the mind of the hindrances then you can apply that level of concentration and purity of mind to experiences outside of formal meditation. Purity of mind means that you are able to attend to a sensation without adding stories to it that are rooted in the hindrances to mindfulness (attachment, aversion, doubt, worry and slackness/laziness/lethargy of body and mind). For example: If you have warm hands and you say, "I like warm hands; they are so pleasurable!" That is attachment . . . If you observe cold hands and you say/think something like, "I hate cold hands." That is the hindrance of aversion . . . If your hands are cold and you ignore mindfulness because you do not believe it is beneficial then you have doubt about the practice . . . If you have cold hands and you say something like, "I am scared, what will happen if my hands get too cold, I could get hurt and experience painfulness." That is worry . . . If the mind becomes sluggish and ignores the sensation because of that sluggishness then you have lethargy of mind. Instead of saying or thinking any of these things you should simply observe the sensation in the hands. If you can not do this it is a sign that there is still work to be done in regards to purifying your mind. If those thoughts arise notice them, then let them go and try to return to observing the bare sensation. 

It is important to work both samatha and vipassana rather than skipping samatha and waiting for days when vipassana is easier and feels more natural. 

I have heard that sitting in full lotus can harm areas of the legs. Also that sitting too long can cause blood clots. This is avoidable; walking meditation and even meditating during menial tasks (e.g., washing dishes, showering, painting, etc.) are practical approaches. Eventually a practitioner can meditate during any and all activities. In a certain sense, mental breakdown, is a beneficial result. I have never heard of a negative mental breakdown from meditation. 

I have heard that a practitioner does not go from first jhana directly to second jhana or from second jhana directly to third jhana and so on. Instead, they go through momentary and access concentration to get to first jhana; then they drop out of first jhana and go through momentary and access concentration to get to second jhana and so on. First of all, is this correct, am I totally wrong or is there debate with regards to this? Secondly, do the factors of access concentration change depending on which jhana someone is trying to enter? 

Is the way I choose to react to a situation based entirely off of past karma or is there something else that determines how I react to an external object? I am confused between my understanding that ultimately there is no control and yet I can control my reactions to situations. Is there only a sense of control as long as an individual is not fully enlightened? 

Nirvana during life (nirvana with remainder) - indicating the experience of someone who has experienced nirvana in their lifetime but still remains in their physical body. Nirvana after death (nirvana without remainder) - indicating the experience of nirvana for someone after their death. 

In the same way the buddha referred to those who wander through Jhana as foolish cows, can individuals wander and get lost within the cycles of insight?
