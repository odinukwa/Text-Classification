Not only does he not consider chemical weapons inhumane, but clearly opines that mustard gas should have been used against Jews, during the first World War. Another quote that shows he considered chemical warfare effective is: 

In the early 1920s the relationships between the Kemalists and the Bolsheviks were friendly, based on their common fight against "imperialist governments". In 1920, Lenin supplied Ataturk with: 

Goethe's inspirations for the play included Jacob Bidermann's (1578 – 1627) Legend of the Doctor of Paris, and that may also be a timeframe you'd be interested in looking at. However, since Goethe doesn't mention the exact timeframe Faust takes place in, we can only speculate. The "medieval wizard" image is quite common, and it's probably in reference to Johann Georg Faust (c. 1480 – c. 1540), an alchemist, astrologer and magician, the suggested real person behind the legend. Your second picture is actually a 17th century portrait of him. 

The Carthaginians were in several ways distinct from their Phoenician forefathers, while at the same time remaining a recognizably Phoenician offshoot and maintaining cultural ties with Tyre throughout their history. A notable difference is that the Carthaginians were an aristocratic society, while most other Phoenician city states were hereditary royalties. Furthermore the Carthaginian religion, while a direct continuation of the Phoenician religion, had distinct elements adopted from the local traditions of the civilizations the Carthaginians came into contact with. I think the more accurate description is that the Carthaginians were a distinct branch of the Phoenician civilization, one that today we commonly refer to as Punics, from their Latin name. 

The picture is symbolic, it's not supposed to depict an actual historical battle. Castro is not shown as actively participating in the landing, he's shown as a "larger than life" figure. If he was participating, it wouldn't be against the landing of the soldiers, but the other way around. Notice the colour of the uniforms and the similarity of the hats, Castro's forces are not the defenders of the beach, they are the assailants. That said, Castro participated in a number of battles, at least in the early stages of the revolution. For example, his arrest happened during the Moncada attack. 

The reason you find wildly varied depictions of Faust is because there are quite a few versions of the Faustian legend, Goethe's being fairly recent. Here's a brief and incomplete list: 

Source: Map showing the Greek world during the Greco-Persian Wars (ca. 500–479 BC). Xerxes' army moved North from Sardis, seeking alliances with or conquering Ionian cities. There was extremely little of interest for Xerxes after Abydos (the crossing point, according to Herodotus). Going all the way to Bosphorus, a few days of marching essentially in the opposite direction of Greece, just to save a few meters of a (floating) bridge wouldn't have been the wisest of decisions. More importantly, Xerxes' land route was paralleled by the route of his fleet. The fleet was essential in the crossing: 

Even if Lycurgus never existed in the first place, it is clear that he enjoyed a legendary hero cult status in Ancient Sparta and his retrae were thought to be divinely inspired, and thus followed dogmatically. All contemporary and near contemporary sources suggest that the Spartan society relied almost exclusively on oral tradition. The only archaeological finds that go a bit against the theory that Ancient Spartans kept no written records are a few inscriptions found in the Evrotas valley, no literary works survive, assuming they ever existed. These limited finds, however, by no means compare to the wealth of literary evidence we have for the rest of the Ancient Greek world, it's possible that they were simply minor transgressions. 1 A common translation would be "sayings". 2 Crete's own legendary law-giver, Minos, was thought of as a son of Zeus, and the Cretan origin Herodotus suggests may imply that the retrae were based on the divine laws of Minos. Plutarch also mentions that Lycurgus visited Crete, prior to presenting the rhetrae to the Spartans. 

The earliest references I could find where Satan is called διάβολος, are in the Book of Revelation, written somewhere between 70 AD to 90 AD in Koine Greek: 

Excavations in the general area in 1939 by Spyridon Marinatos2 revealed a large number of bronze and silver spearheads and arrowheads in Kolonos hill, verifying (to some extend) Herodotus' account of the last stand. The finds are consistent with contemporary Persian / Asian designs of the era, and today can be seen in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens: 

Furthermore, no temple - of Tanit or Ba'al-Hamon - has been found in the necropolis, although only a portion of the area has been explored and intense urbanization of modern day Carthage doesn't offer many opportunities for further excavations. M'hamed Hassine Fantar, Director of Research at the Tunisian Institute of National Cultural Heritage, also strongly denies the possibility his ancient forefathers practice infanticide, and accepts the view that the Tophet hosted remains of children that died of natural causes, and were later cremated. In all likelihood, the matter won't be concluded anytime soon - if ever. The razing of Carthage to the ground probably destroyed any conclusive evidence, and the Roman accounts are anything but reliable. 

On June 19, 1911 there was a near-mutiny on the armored cruiser Georgios Averof, while she was undergoing repairs after running aground at Spithead (near Portsmouth, UK). Wikipedia alleges the reason was the Greek sailors unfamiliarity with blue cheese (that their English hosts presumably served them), without providing any sources. The Greek version of the article doesn't provide a reason at all, and a random Greek blog I've found alleges the reason was the fact that she run aground. In any case, the near-mutiny lead to the immediate replacement of her Captain by the more experienced and capable Pavlos Kountouriotis. The blue cheese story sounds plausible, and so does the alternative explanation that the crew didn't enjoy having a Captain that run the ship aground on her maiden voyage and only three days after he took command. In fact, both stories may very well be true, but I can't seem to be able to find any reliable sources for what actually happened. My searches are hindered by the fact that there was another mutiny on the Averof, in April, 1941. Although Wikipedia surprisingly only mentions the event in passing, Greek sources emphasize it, to the point that every possible combination of search terms I could think of results in documents about the 1941 event. Help? 

Benjamin Isaac in his book The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity provides a prime example of scientific racism in ancient Greece: 

European monarchies are extremely intertwined, all European dynasties are related to each other, it's not surprising that they use very similar symbols. For example, take a look at the family tree of the German monarchs: 

And that's about it, no mention of specific cities Pythagoras might have visited in the area, or any other details. Which is a bit suspect, as Diogenes Laërtius goes into some detail (quoting various sources) for Pythagoras' travels within Greece, to Egypt, to Italy and to... Hades. All this, of course, are on the book on Pythagoras. In general there are several references to Arabia, Judaea and India, some as vague references to places that inspired Greek philosophy and some as references to places other Greek philosophers visited (including the Pythagoreans, but not Pythagoras himself). As an example, the preface of the work is: 

I'm afraid the answer is that we don't know. The Romans gradually replaced their 8 day week (the imperial nundinal cycle) with a 7 day week over a course of a century, after Julius Caesar's calendar reform in 46 BC. Their reasons for doing so are unclear, however we do know that the two cycles co-existed for quite some time. Ultimately, the nundinal cycle fell in disuse and the 7 day cycle prevailed. One interesting hypothesis, supported by the names of the days in the Greco-Roman world, is that the 7 day cycle prevailed over the nundinal cycle because of its astrological symbolism: Each day represents one of the seven classical planets. While we don't know for sure what prompted the switch, Hellenistic astrology seems like a far more likely influence for the Romans than Jewish culture. In 321 AD, the 7 day week - by then the norm - was officially adopted by Emperor Constantine. Constantine's primary reason for normalizing the length of the week seems to have been for all his subjects, regardless of religion, to observe the day of the sun. 

The story seems likely; Aristotle was the father of taxonomy and his personal library was one of the earliest acquisitions of the Library. The early librarians probably modeled their own approaches upon Aristotle's. However, we don't have any details on how Aristotle organized his library, and to what degree the early librarians adopted his methods. What we do know, is that Zenodotus of Ephesus, the first librarian according to the Suda, arranged books in different rooms according to their subject matter. Then, within each room, he arranged the books alphabetically (by their author's name). His system may seem rudimentary by today's standards, but for the time it was revolutionary. In fact, it's the earliest known instance of alphabetic organization. Callimachus of Cyrene furthered Zenodotus system in his magnum opus, the Tables of people who distinguished themselves in all branches of learning. Pinakes, as the work is better known, is a bio-bibliographical survey of the more significant Greek writings, divided in 120 books. According to Wikipedia: 

"Seres" was the contemporary name for the inhabitants of eastern Central Asia and it means "of silk", or people of the "land where silk comes from." Alexandria Eschate was probably the first major Hellenistic outpost that came into contact with the Chinese, and the Dayuan that are mentioned in Zhang Qian's reports were probably descendants of Greek colonists. These interactions were crucial in paving the way for the silk road. Though records of direct philosophical and religious exchanges between Greeks and Chinese don't exist, the two civilizations certainly came into contact, even if only indirectly via their respective contacts with civilizations of the Indian subcontinent. Buddhism spread towards the west was mainly because of the silk routes, and the various Indo-Greek kingdoms that followed the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom influenced it immensely, and Greco-Buddhist artistic elements can be traced in Chinese and even Japanese Buddhist art. 

The first (known) female Pharaoh is Sobekneferu (or Neferusobek) that ruled Egypt three centuries before Hatshepsut, from 1806 to 1802 BC. Sobekneferu is probably the earlier female ruler (in general, not only Egypt's) whose name we know and for whose reign we can be reasonably certain. James Henry Breasted regarded Hatshepsut as "the first great woman in history of whom we are informed.", and I think you read that with emphasis on "first" when you should have read it with emphasis on "great" and "informed". Hatshepsut had a very long and (mostly) peacefull reign, and is commonly quoted as one of the most succesfull Pharaohs. Another candidate for the earlier female ruler is Nitocris, a female Pharaoh mentioned by Herodotus: 

Diogenes Laërtius mentions several of Pythagoras' travels and he mentions that the philosopher visited the Chaldeans and the Magi: 

Hitler was awarded honorary citizenship in a few Austrian cities. Amstetten revoked Hitler's honorary citizenship in May 2011 and Braunau, which includes Ranshofen, Hitler's birthplace, followed in July 2011. Klagenfurt's mayor, Christian Scheider, removed Hitler from the city's roll of honour without waiting for verification that the city had ever honoured him: 

During the early stages of the Turkish War of Independence, Kemal commanded two army corps: One in Ankara and one in Erzurum. At first Erzurum was Kemal's base of operations, but on 27 December, 1919 he moved his Representative Committee to Ankara to be closer to Istanbul. Ankara also had a railway and being roughly at the center of Turkey made more sense as a capital logistically. Eskişehir, which also had a railway and was close to Istanbul, was either very near the border or occupied by the Triple Entente and its proxies during various stages of the war. In April 1920, Kemal established a parliament in Ankara, officially making the city his capital. After the nationalist victory in 1923 and the overthrow of the Sultanate, moving the capital back to Istanbul didn't make much sense. Kemal enjoyed popular support throughout Turkey, but it was in Ankara - his war capital - where his support was the strongest. In contrast, there were still remnants of Ottoman elements in Istanbul, who may have tried to sabotage the new regime if given the chance. Furthermore, the city's position in the middle of the Rumeli (west) and Anadolu (east) territories allowed for more efficient central control of the young Republic. Also, having the capital as far away from the Republic's enemies (Greece, mainly) as possible was certainly a bonus. Lastly, keeping the capital in Ankara certainly had symbolic value. Kemal had dissolved a six hundred old empire and was attempting to revamp the entirety of Turkish culture. Moving back to the old capital wouldn't have helped that cause, while keeping the new capital sent a strong signal that this was a new era for Turkey.
