You have provided your reasons for why you believe your friend should leave, but not for why your friend has not left already, or does not seem to want to. Your friend seems to have a job where he is well respected and has established a prominent position due to his work, something which he is likely proud of, and which pushes him to work hard. Clearly you believe this has become detrimental to his personal life, but from his perspective, why should he leave? It seems, from an outside perspective, that his hard work was recognized and rewarded with promotions. You indicate that the company "will throw him under the bus at any chance they get", but the combination of his being rewarded for his work and the respect he allegedly receives from his peers does not make this evident to me, and probably does not to him either. Which is not to say that you are wrong, but if your friend sees no problem, he has no motivation to quit. As to your other concerns, these seem to be issues with your friend, not his workplace. If he works too much, at the expense of time with his family, or he has "hero syndrome", why do you believe that these things will change with a new job? Rather than convincing your friend to quit, you may simply wish to convince him to ask for a raise and spend less time at work, or to leverage his leadership position and delegate some of his work to the rest of the company. If he attempts these actions and is rebuffed, that would be sufficient cause for him to seek new employment. In summary: The problems you list are all things that should be resolvable given your friends position. Before suggesting a dramatic action like quitting, he should first see what actions he can take to resolve these problems with his company. It is when a person's concerns are NOT addressed that they should look for new employment. 

When your manager asks you to perform a task and you don't have time to do both that task and everything else you've committed to, tell him that. You can inform him of your workload and still be respectful. Try something like, "Sure boss, I'd love to do X, but I've already committed to do Y and Z, and I don't have time to do all three. Which tasks should I prioritize? Is anyone available to help me?" Then go from there. If you're concerned about future backlash from not doing a task your manager tells you not to do, follow up your conversation with an email. If there are other stakeholders involved (i.e. people other than your manager request your time), copy them on the email or ask your manager to speak with them. If someone asks you to perform a task and your schedule is full, refer them to your manager. Don't be afraid to use your manager as a buffer between you and the people requesting your time; that's part of their job. Don't complain about the work ethics of others. It will make you look whiny, and it's irrelevant anyway. The only thing that matters is your workload and whether it exceeds the amount of work you can do. It's the responsibility of your manager to decide how to deal with you having too much work, and it's also his responsibility to deal with slackers. Don't try to do his job. 

I work at an IT services company. It has about 10 departments of mostly IT consultants. Most of these departments stand on their own and there is little interaction between them. In the past few years most of the projects we've done have been "in house" so all of the colleagues were always together for the most part of the day. In last year or two a lot has changed. A lot of people left, a lot of new people joined and, most importantly, the projects we do are now usually performed at the client's office. When we're at the client it is usually solo. As was to be expected, most of our (new) colleagues don't feel like they are part of a team and so company morale is quite low. I've been working on improving this and my efforts have been noticed and so I've been promoted to "community manager". I've tried to organise knowledge sharing sessions (that we stream so that colleagues at other locations can follow as well) and after-hour drinks but I feel it is still not enough. I've thought about organising events for two departments at a time to get to know each other but I've not had very positive feedback on that. So my question is this: What should I do (or propose to the management to do) to get the community going again? Edit: There is budget available to organise events but it is not easy to come by. Each department has about 100 people. Edit2: We are allowed to take up billable time to organise events; but management feels that the commitment should come from both sides. This means that part of the time can be billable, the other part would be personal time. Such as an event in the afternoon or early evening. We do have quite a few large meeting rooms or cantines; there is enough room to host a bunch of people. The standard infrastructure is available; projection equipment, sandwiches and beverages when needed, ... 

Please don't do this. I'm a young, female professional just starting my career, and I have had a colleague call me to comment on my picture. It was very thinly veiled as a "oh you might be interested in this thing I know about", but he commented on my picture and how I was young and attractive multiple times. It made me feel like some people don't take me seriously just because of how I look, and made me wonder how many other men interacted with me for the same reasons but hid it better. It also made me very uncomfortable and glad that I ended up being pulled from the project he was on. No one should have to feel that way at work! It's one thing to ask out a colleague because you've gotten to know them through working with them and feel there's a connection. Even then it's risky, but it's understandable if you spend a lot of time together. If you want to pick up women based on their looks alone, go to a bar or club. If you're still on the fence, consider how you would feel if a man did to you what you want to do to this woman. Wouldn't you be uncomfortable? Wouldn't you feel it was completely inappropriate and a little intimidating? How would you like to find out a man singled you out to join his group because he liked your picture in a newsletter? It's super creepy, right? Don't do this. Treat her like a professional, not a random pretty face. 

As the boss, your employer has the final say on how to present the company to the world. If he/she prefers the design you believe to be inferior, the decision is out of your hands. That said, if you really believe the design has significant flaws, you ought to have a more objective explanation as to why. "Unattractive" is to some extent a subjective evaluation, as evidenced by the fact that your boss seems to like it. You mention that there is poor placement/color. In my mind these are things that you ought to be able to change without fundamentally altering the design. One option would be to offer some minor tweaks, perhaps changing the hue of certain colors or slight rearrangement to address the problems you see. This will allow your employer to keep the core design, which he seems to have an emotional attachment to, while still satisfying your standards. Additionally, you should consider to what extent this will actually affect business. Your fears that you might lose clients will sound somewhat hyperbolic to a layperson, so if you want to make that argument, you ought to have some sort of evidence to back up your assertion that that is a risk. 

Forget the law about smoking in a public building for a moment. Even if you are right that he can be fined, bringing that up is going to cause a lot of sore feelings. Nobody appreciates being ratted out to the authorities, no matter how wrong they are, and it should be your last resort. Instead, consider the problem as if there were no legal remedy. I think most people, especially smokers, would consider smoking in a personal office to be reasonable behavior. If he keeps the door shut while smoking, then there shouldn't be enough smoke leaking out to cause problems for the grand majority of people. It's possible you are the only one bothered this, so don't approach him as if he is posing some dire health threat to the entire office. He's not; he's acting in a reasonable way that happens to cause problems for you, and you need to find a solution that is agreeable to you both. I suggest you meet with him at your desk or a conference room. Say something like "I understand you like to smoke in your office, but even small amounts of smoke bother me due to a medical condition." Then suggest a solution that allows him to smoke and you to not have to suffer it. Can you be assigned a desk that's farther away from his office? Can you find someplace to meet other than his office in the future? Can he keep the door shut for at least fifteen minutes after finishing a cigarette and/or open a window? You get the idea. In short, there is likely a solution that will make you both happy. Find it and pitch it to your boss. Do not attack, threaten, or blame him. He's not your adversary; he's someone you need to work with to solve a problem. If you go to him with a cooperative attitude rather than a confrontational one, he is very likely to want to help you.
