Wouldn't it follow that the quantum doubles of the two groups are isomorphic? Would this help to set the question? (Sorry for posting this as an answer, didn't manage to leave it as a comment). 

Usually you want to consider subfactors of finite index. Suppose M and N are infinite factors (in the sense that there is no finite trace), then M-N bimodules correspond to morphisms from N to M. Connes' fusion of bimodules corresponds to composition of morphisms. Nothing really changes if your factors are finite, you just have to consider ampli-morphisms. This is a 2-category, as you pointed out, and it has (for free) some additional structure which I would describe as a "spherical 2-C* category". In particular each 1-morphism has a dual, a categorical trace and a categorical dimension and so on (technically, this is a consequence of the existence of a Pimsner-Popa basis). Finite index corresponds to 1-morphisms with finite categorical dimension. More precisely, the minimal (subfactor) index is the square of the categorical dimension. Suppose you have a morphism \rho N into M (or equivalently, an N-M bimodule). Then you have a dual \bar \rho M into N. These two 1-morphisms generate your 2-category. Often when N is a subfactor of M and \rho is the inclusion morphism, people tend to overlook domains of morphisms, and talk only about a tensor category of endomorphisms of M. This can be confusing. In any case, we are always talking about the 2-category generated by \rho and \bar \rho. The whole category of endomorphisms of M is huge, you don't want that. 1) Two possibilities: people are referring to the category of M - M morphisms (equivalently, bimodules) generated by \rho \otimes \bar \rho; people are overlooking the domain of morphisms (as above) viewing \rho and \bar \rho as elements of the tensor category of M endomorphisms and they are talking about the tensor category generated by these two. By generated I mean complete w.r.t. composition, projections, direct sum... Beware, only alternate compositions of \rho and \bar rho are allowed (so it's really a 2 category). 2) The category generated by \rho \otimes \bar \rho is Morita equivalent to the category generated by \bar \rho \otimes \rho. 5) I don't understand completely the question: the centre of which category? In any case, I would rather start from this paper $URL$ 

There is a proof that ii) follows from the other axioms in Kassel's book (proposition X111.1.2 p.316). 

For a compact group $G$ one can define the following equivalence: given two irreps $X$ and $Y$, $X \sim Y$ if they both appear as summands in a finite string of tensor products of irreps $X_1 \otimes X_2 \otimes \dots X_n$. The equivalence classes have the structure of an abelian group which turns out to be the dual of the centre of $G$. This was conjectured in $URL$ and proven in $URL$ Thus $Hom(W \otimes W^*,V) \neq 0$ iff V is in the identity class (i.e. the centre acts trivially on $V$). 

It is said that this identity amounts, in the Riemmanian geometry sense, to the saying that, loosely, "the boundary of the bounday is null". So my questions are Question 1: What would be a more rigorous statement of "the boundary of the boundary is null" and how does the above identity is equivalent ot it? Question 2: Is there an analog to this geometrical intuition in general relativity? I assume both questions might be answered with a reference, which is even better. 

Most of what I've found were either research papers, or citation of a convenient formula for a specific application. I'm looking for good reviews or textbook chapters which focus on the formula itself. Thanks Amir 

The Burger's equation $$y_t (t,x) + y\cdot y_x - y_{xx} =0 \, \, ,$$ can be obtained as a limit of the one-dimensional cubic Nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) $$ i\psi _t (t,x) + \psi _{xx} +|\psi|^2\psi =0 \, \, ,$$ but can also be obtained as an approximation of the Kardar-Parizi-Zhang (KPZ) equation $$h_t (t,x) = h_{xx} + (h_x)^2 +\eta (t,x) \, \, ,$$ where $\eta $ is a Gaussian noise term. Question: I don't know any of the details of both approximations/transformations, nor what kind of results can you deduce from it. Do you know any good references for that? The Burger's equation Wiki page offers some information, but not enough (for me) to get the full picture. There are a lot of papers which are somehow related to it, but none that I found were good as an introductory text. Thanks! Edit: I don't want to change the OP, but as noted, the transformation is to a linear Schrodinger equation with a potential, not the NLS. The NLS itself can be obtained as the PDE for the slowly-varying envelope of small perturbations in the KdV and Klein-Gordon equation, see e.g., (Ablowitz, Mark J. Nonlinear dispersive waves: asymptotic analysis and solitons. Vol. 47. Cambridge University Press, 2011). 

Given two probability density functions (PDF) $f$ and $g$, both defined over the same set $X$, there are many ways to describe/measure the distance between them, e.g., KL divergence and Hellinger distance, to name a few. What I'm looking for is a distance function $d(f,g)$ that gives an order of magnitude difference. To be concrete, if at some area $f\sim 2\times 10^4$, $f_1 \sim 10^4$, and $f_2 \sim 10^2$, I want that $d(f,f_1) \ll d(f,f_2)$. Is there a known, statistically or probabilistically meaningful way, to do that? I know that this question is a bit vague, but if I knew how to define such a distance function, I wouldn't be asking this question. Note that, as in the examples above, $d(\cdot, \cdot)$ doesn't have to be a metric. Thanks Edit: This has been cross-posted in Cross.Validated 

Let $(X,\mu)$ be a probability space, and $0<\epsilon<1/2$. Let $\{A_i:i\in \mathbb{N}\}$ be a collection of measurable subsets of $X$ such that $\mu(A_i)\geq \epsilon$ for all $i\in\mathbb{N}$. Is it always true that there are indices $i<j$ such that $\mu(A_i\cap A_j)\geq \epsilon^2$ ? Is it possible to classify the (possible) counterexamples? 

Let $\alpha$ be an irrational with $0<\alpha<1$. Consider the function given by \begin{align*} f: &\mathbb{N}\longrightarrow \mathbb{N}\\ &x\longmapsto [ \alpha\cdot x]\end{align*} where $[r]$ is the largest integer that is less than or equal to $r$ for $r\in\mathbb{R}$. Let $N=\left[\frac{1}{\alpha}\right]$ be the integer part of $\frac{1}{\alpha}$, and consider the following numbers: $A_1(n)=\#\{k\leq n : f(k)<f(k+1)\}$ $A_2(n)=\#\{k\leq n : f(k)=f(k+N)\}$ The questions are the following: 1) Is it true that $\displaystyle{\lim_{n\to\infty} \dfrac{A_1(n)}{n}=\alpha}$? 2) What is the value of $\displaystyle{\lim_{n\to\infty} \dfrac{A_2(n)}{n}}$, if it exists? The problem above came out when I was trying to find examples of classes of finite ordered structures that satisfies strong conditions on their definable sets (for my Ph.D. Thesis). I translated the problem in simple terms, and I would really appreciate any help. (If it is too easy, a hint will be good. If the problem is related with something in number theory, combinatorics, ergodic theory or anything else, I would also appreciate if you tell me how) 

At first, I thought that it was enough to take either $k=1$ or $k=m$, which are cases that I understand very well, but the sequence $(0,0,1,2,2,0,2,1,1)$ only works when $k=2$. My first atempt was that for a fixed $k$, the position $j$ was $2g$ (too good) if both $U_{1,j}(k)\geq k$ and $U_{2,j}(k)\geq k$, $2b$ (too bad) if both where $<k$, and $1g1b$ otherwise. Then, if we define an "interval" to be a subsequence starting immediately after a zero and ending with the next zero, one can measure the "goodness" of the sequence by measuring how good or bad is each interval. It turns out that for $k=1$ we have: 

I would like to know what nice model theoretic properties (for example simplicity, NIP, stability, etc) can be preserved when we add a new predicate to the language. Explicitly, if T is an L-theory and LP=L∪{P} (a new predicate). Under which conditions of T we have that the new theory TP obtained by a suitable interpretation of the predicate P becomes simple? or NIP? or stable? I know, for example, that if T is simple and eliminates the quantifier ∃∞ then TP is simple (Chatzidakis, Pillay). But, what other theorems like this are known? Are there easy examples witnessing the failure of this ``preserving nice properties'' phenomena? Thank you in advance for the possible answers... 

Given $m\geq 1$, let $I=(a_1,\ldots,a_{3m})$ be a sequence such that $I$ contains exactly $m$ zeros, $m$ ones, and $m$ twos. Given $i=1,2$ and $j\leq 3m,k\leq m$ we can define $$U_{i,j}(k)=\text{number of $i$'s before finding $k$ zeros, starting from position $j$}.$$ (moving to the right, in a cyclic way) For instance, for the sequence $(0,2,1,1,0,2)$, we would have $U_{1,2}(1)=2,U_{1,6}(2)=2$ (here is necessary to move to the beginning to continue counting) and, in total (using a matrix notation), $$U(1)=\begin{bmatrix}U_{i,j}(1)\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$ $$U(2)=\begin{bmatrix}U_{i,j}(2)\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 2\\ 1 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2\end{bmatrix}$$ 

I have been hearing a lot about a theory of interpolation using rational function, parallel to that of polynomial interpolation. I'm looking for a book chapter, or even short lecture notes, that will give me the basic results and tools of this field. 

My question: Are you familiar with a multivariate-calculus version and proof of this theorem? I searched most of the textbooks mentioned here and here, but still no luck. Any ideas? I believe it is not usually covered in graduate curses of advanced multivariate analysis, and so it is pretty difficult to find it in the textbooks. (This is cross posted from math.se, since a week has passed and it recieved little-to-no-answer. Also, this is not to be confused with the Leibniz rule $(fg)'=f'g +fg'$, as in this post. 

This might be a little, soft, but I'll try Consider the interval $I=[-1,1]$. We will define a chaotic function $f:\mathbb{R}_+ \times I \to \mathbb{C}$ in the following traditional way: For every $M>0$ and $\delta >0$ there exsist two points $x,y \in I$ with $|x- y | < \delta$, and a time $T>0$ such that $|f(T,x) - f(T,y)| >M$. We would also like to demand smoothness in $I$, so that at least for some $[0,T) \subseteq \mathbb{R}_+$ we have that $f$ is analytic in $[0,T)\times I$. My question is what is the traditional way, or the most adequate way, to define smooth chaotic function? Can $f$ be analytic? a limit of analytic functions? Can we demand that for every $t\in \mathbb{R}_+$, $f(t,\cdot)\in C^{\infty}(I)$? 

I'm following Szego's book on orthogonal polynomials. In chapter III he considers $f \in L^2\left((a,b),d\alpha \right)$, with $-\infty \leq a < b \leq \infty $. There exist a set of orthogonal polynomials $\{p_n \}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ w.r. to the measure $d\alpha$. We consider the kernel $K_n(t,x) := \sum\limits_{\nu=0}^{n} \bar{p_{\nu} (t)} p_{\nu} (x) $. Then one can show that $\int\limits_{a}^{b} K_n (t,x) f(t) \, d\alpha (t) = \sum\limits_{\nu = 0}^{n} \hat{f}(n)p_n (x) $, the spectral expension of order $n$. So, if we settled that the polynomial expansion of $f$ is an integral transform, there's a detailed discussion in Szego's book, Davis "approximation theory" and many other books about its $L^2$ error. Edit: If we look in Aronszajn (1950), we can have by Section 9 that the kernels converge in L^2 norm. Edit 2: I recommend you to read the aforementioned paper, as it deals with the much broader class of reproducing kernels, and give a lot of conditions and results that are relevant to your question. 

Consider $X = \mathbb{R}$ , and for every $a \in [-\infty , \infty ] $ , $(a,\infty )$ is an open set. It is a topology because any finite intersection yields an open "ray" of the largest starting point, and any union yields an open "ray" with the minimal starting point, which might be $-\infty $. It is worth noticing that if we'd choose $[a, \infty )$ as our topology base, we'd result in open rays as well (consider $\cup_j [1/j, \infty)$ for example. Well, now take the sequence $x_j = 2+ 1/j$. We now show it converges $\forall b\leq 2$. For such $b$ and an arbitrary open set $b \in U$, it has the form of $U = (c, \infty ), c < b <2 < x_j , \forall j$, therefore $x_j$ converges to all $b \leq 2$ This examples relays heavily on the fact that every neighborhood of $b$ is also a neighborhood of $2$ , and therefore you can only say of a sequence what it's minimal neighborhood, but not a point of convergence.
