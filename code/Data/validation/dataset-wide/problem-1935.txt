I am working as a Dev team lead for a project. I am daily receiving so much information from various sources related to work, project etc.. from many channels like Emails, formal meetings , casual chat with people, some information from magazines, websites like stack exchange etc..My main challenge is filtering the useful information and keep only the useful information with me . Since I am not doing it very efficiently I have the below problems 

I am working for on IT organization as Team Leader. I have a team member who works as developer. In age he is elder than me. He is very prone is picking argument and making offensive personal comments. Here is the latest incidents One fine morning I received a mail saying that 

I am working for Indian Outsourcing Organization. I have joined Onsite team for new project 2 months back. Below are the some points that I See risk for team. (1) Manager doesn't listen much, doesn't lead much, doesn't consider team members opinions or concerns. Hence team doesn't get much visibility and clarity about project and situations in the project. (2) Very apprehensive about documentation any communication. All the communication and commitments occurs verbally and sometimes the communication is very indirect also. The result of which any risk happens in project we don't have any option to defend ourself. Finally team has to suffer consequences if any bad thing happens. (3) Since there is no proper guiding and leading, many times the actions, the decisions team member takes does not backed up by Organization policies and team members are at their own risk. At this situation how to handle this manager in order to avoid further risk to team and project? Updates based on Responses: The major problem here is manager is highly discouraging documenting those facts. I have tried to document many times. Firstly my boss doesn't replies to my emails in which I am asking for confirmations/clarifications. He just calls me or talk to me and gave verbal clarifications. One day I got too warning from my boss saying that, If you have any questions just ask me, or call me or don't write mails. 

The market seems to be valuing you higher than you think you're worth. You should take the money. First, it's odd to reject compensation. You will raise red flags with management. It's just strange behavior. Second, it's not unethical to decline compensation but you will set a terrible precedent. They will remember this and may decide not to offer bonuses in the future...which may not be a problem unless you think you should get one. If you find that you simply cannot bear to keep the money you can always give it to a charity; you don't need to keep it! The acpilot Retirement Charity and General Slush Fund is accepting donations and would be honored to relieve you of any money you believe you have not earned!! We prefer briefcases full of cash but will settle for a sack with a dollar sign on it. Edit: At least one person took my charity pitch seriously so I guess this needs a warning label... Caution: do not actually send money to anyone claiming to be a representative of the acpilot Retirement Charity and General Slush Fund. If anyone approaches you claiming to represent aRC&GSF, they are scamming you. 

In the circumstances, seeing a mental health professional seems like an action you should take irrespective of your employer's demands. When you find one, discuss with them (not necessarily as your top priority though), what the normal 'back to work' procedure in similar circumstances is in your country. They have been trained in how to discuss their patients with others without revealing unnecessary personal information, and if you can trust them to manage your case, you ought to be able to trust them to report on your case to people like your employer on a 'need to know' basis if it is required, i.e. to provide information that your employer requires and is entitled to without divulging anything else. 

I have been in this position myself, albeit as part of a small team of designated experts, and we tried most of the strategies listed in other answers with limited success. Eventually, I left that company, and now have a role where being the expert is less intrinsic to my job description. Unfortunately, the only thing that will actually work is support from management for you to migrate away from being the expert. My guess, from experience, is that at least part of the time, people are coming to you because their supervisors have told them to. I also discovered when I was in your position, that there were occasions when said supervisors specifically told their employees NOT to attempt to 'waste their time' figuring out the answers themselves, but go straight to the experts. In short, there are many strategies that could work, but they are all in danger of failing unless the managers of the employees using you as a walking encyclopedia support the process of their employees becoming knowledgeable and using your free service less. 

Sounds like you need to ask for a signing bonus totaling the amount you worked. They may decline to pay you but it's your own fault. Never work for free. Never keep working for free. DO NOT - DO NOT - DO NOT pad your timesheet. A few thousand dollars is not worth the risk. Consider this a very cheap lesson. 

You get career progression, a better job, and more money? Yes. No question. Take the new job. If your current employer values you they will match (or exceed) your external offer. Do not disclose the details of your new offer, make your employer bid. You may end up with an even better deal. Remember, the moment your employer needs to save money and cut jobs, your position is at risk. They will show no loyalty but will thank you for yours as you are shown the door. There is nothing wrong with self interest. You owe your employer nothing but the service you agreed to perform. Evidently you have held up your end of the deal as they saw fit to give you a raise. Offer your employer an opportunity to make a better offer. If they decline or come up short, take the new job. You won't burn bridges with people who matter. Anyone who is offended at your departure is too small minded to be a concern later in your career. 

I'm in a phase of hiring at the moment. I would say the length per se is something of a red herring, but to rephrase your question slightly, absolutely it is offputting, and likely to lead to not getting an interview, if your resume doesn't include sufficient information to enable an informed decision. And yes, I have binned candidates due to their not having given me enough data to make an informed decision, especially where that co-incides with no explanation in any form (cover note, email message, resume body) of how the candidate meets the advertised criteria. You need to include data that lets the hiring manager know that you meet all the threshold requirements (some of which might be unstated - such as 'sufficient grasp of English written communication'), and data that convinces the hiring manager that there are ways in which you are superior to other candidates who meet all the threshold requirements. Unless you know the other candidates personally (may be possible in a niche professional job, where the number of candidates meeting the criteria is very low, and you have likely met them at professional events - e.g. judgeship, senior surgeon - but unlikely elsewhere) there is going to be some redundancy in your resume, because you can't completely anticipate how the other candidates are presenting themselves. Excepting jobs where the requirements are 'have a pulse, and get to the site reliably', it's difficult to imagine less than one page getting those jobs done. That said, if your current role is very prestigious, and you have a very strong reputation in your industry, you may occasionally get away with a very short resume. You can imagine, for example, that if Stephen Hawking had wanted to switch from Cambridge to Oxford or maybe Princeton some time in the last 35 years, once he'd convinced them he was the 'real' Stephen Hawking, the details on a resume wouldn't have had much to do with the decision (not saying that getting the job would be certain - just that any plausible interviewer would be thoroughly familiar with Hawking's work and able to make a decision). To summarise, be sceptical if your resume seems very short. Imagine you're the hiring manager - is every thing you would want to know written on the resume, including ways you are different to other candidates (for example, if you are applying for a graduate position, having a degree doesn't make you different)? If necessary, put it aside and come back to it the next day, so that important information is not omitted.
