She is New Kadampa - I don't know where that sits under the various Buddhist umbrellas. I think you should know that. I didn't know and I did some minimal research the last time you mentioned it. You could at least read the whole Wikipedia article carefully. My hasty opinion based on minimal research and no personal experience is that it has many branches in England, and that might be why you're studying with them: i.e. because they have school in your town. Wikipedia suggests to me that people "teach" before they've finished their own studies -- I imagine it may be possible that some of them don't understand theory, not practice, nor how to teach students. 

I don't know how to reconcile the above two statements, i.e. whether formless is the same as non-percipient. 

But (apart from those) I posted some questions about the Four stages of enlightenment of Theravada Buddhism. If I recommend the following, it's not that mine were good questions (I didn't know what I was asking about, maybe it's not useful to read the questions) but you may find the answers to these topics helpful: 

It's not clear to me what you mean: how can you think you're doing something without actually doing it? I thought it might be a partial answer to your question though: to say that 'kamma' and 'intention' aren't synonyms. Maybe kamma is a consequence of intention, e.g. as described in the first verse of the dhammapada ... but a hypothetical "intention without consequence", if there even is such a thing, doesn't sound to me like the conventional meaning of the word kamma. Maybe the intended meaning of your question was a thought experiment, though, i.e. a way to ask whether the very intention changes anything apart from (or as well as) whatever mundane effect the generous action has? In that case the answer might be yes: e.g. an intention to be kind might be related to your view (e.g. self-view). Whether the intention is a consequence of view, or whether intention has as its consequence an alteration of your view, is harder to say ... to resolve that (logical) difficulty it's easier to say that they (intention and view) arise together, are conditions of each other. 

With an ensō (and "the beauty of imperfection") as an avatar, you might like a Zen story: Obedience. The story reminds me of my mother, a nursery school teacher (very young children) -- she said that instead of trying to control their behaviour by criticizing them, "I wait until they do something right and then praise them" (e.g. "Thank you for putting your work away", or "Thank you for sharing", or etc). One of the funniest stories I remember was of one of her assistants who, instead of directly addressing and criticizing the whole class, raised her voice just loudly enough for everyone to hear and said to my mum: "Mrs. Teacher, where have all the quiet children gone?" 

People sometimes qualify their statements, by adding the word, "conventionally" — and people distinguish between Conventional Truth (Sammuti Sacca) versus Ultimate Truth (Paramattha Sacca). 

You said that your "leader was talking about people who cannot control their cravings and wants, who are easily subjected to actions based on their whims and wants of their anger". Things like cravings and anger (and ignorance) are known akusala-mūla which are translated/called/known in English the "three poisons" or "three unwholesome roots", also "three roots of evil" and "the three unwholesome mental states". In that phrase, akusala is translated as "unwholesome" or even evil. As @sova mentioned in a comment it's the mental state (e.g. of anger) that's unwholesome, or the result (like the tree which grows from the "root") that's unwholesome. 

It's meant as advice to you ... and is not a statement that's meant to censure "a woman" (itthiyā). Similarly you may be stained by ... 

Is there a Buddhist tradition or practice, which involves developing or showing metta towards a non-sentient entity ... for example, towards a jar of rice? Not that I know of. If not, why not? This essay says, 

I personally agree with the article's "commentary" more than with the article itself. As a lay person who has some choice about how to spend "my" money, I find the "market demand" argument persuasive. My personal preference is to be vegetarian but not to criticize the choices that others make. I also know some people (non-Buddhists) who raise, slaughter, and eat their own animals: and I don't see these people as less ethical than those who buy meat ready-killed and butchered from a supermarket. The Dhammapada says, 

You're asking what you can do when inactive. I guess in general you can study, do homework ... maybe socialize! But "inactivity" might be an opportunity to practice the meditation portion of the noble eightfold path. That (subject) leads to more that's been written on the subject: e.g. Right Mindfulness. 

So the three poisons (lust, anger, ignorance) correspond to three types of feeling (pleasant, painful, and neutral); and delusion therefore is associated with a "neutral" feeling, and "consciousness shrouded in a cloak of dull apathy" and "confusion". 

I couldn't find evidence that the Buddha said that. I wanted to find a more accurate/modern translation than the one you're using. The Sutta known as DN 5 - To Kūṭadanta is the only one I found that mentions Kutdanta ... and it (like the one you referenced) also starts by mentioning "sacrifice" ... but the one you referenced talks about Nibanna and Anatta whereas DN 5 is longer but talks about other things. The text you quoted is from The Gospel of Buddha: 

I guess that an alternative way to explain it is that dreams are mind-objects, involving contact between the dream and the mind-consciousness. For example, even when you're "awake" you can remember things: e.g. remember the sight of a place or of a face, or the sound of some music or of a dog barking. When you do that (remember a sense-experience) I think you replay elements of that experience in some parts of your mind (e.g. in the parts of the mind which are responsible for perceiving or being perceived as that experience). 

Here is a link again: Yaeko Iwasaki´s Enlightenment Letters to Harada-Roshi and his Comments This is published in The Three Pillars of Zen. 

In descriptions of the five skandhas the fifth, Vijñāna, is described/translated as "consciousness" and "awareness": as if they're interchangeable. But maybe there are other types of awareness. Ibid. says, 

... where "deeds" is kamma in the above. So perhaps "I am" (the owner) and "I have" (the fruit or result of good and bad actions), until I am able to "end kamma". The Dhammapada says, 

I take it you know the BNS precepts already, so you're asking about the Yogacara tradition. I wonder whether this might be close to what you'e looking for (4 major and 41 minor precepts). 

Buddhism isn't very specific about what "right livelihood" is for lay people; but IMO it includes giving good value for money, not making fraudulent claims about the product or service. 

This version of the Sermon at Benares (which was approximately the first time he spoke to people after he became the Buddha) suggests 'Yes': 

There's translation and commentary on the page above. The associated story ("The Story of Thera Cakkhupala") suggests it might be 'intention'. That's kind of compatible with the poetic use of heart: "he had a change of heart", "his heart wasn't in it", "he did it with all his heart", etc. The root syllable in each line is "mano" and/or "mana": which can also be found here associated with "mental consciousness"; but see also this says that it's used for "mental action" i.e. kamma. My guess is that: 

It seems to me that my mind has or generates lots of semi-random thoughts: they're like memories, or dream fragments, etc., they come and go. That kind of ideation (often visual images, fragmentary visions of people I've known or of places I've seen) is especially apparent when I'm asleep-and-dreaming. They're also apparent if I'm feverish and/or delirious. I expect that people often aren't at their most mentally acute when they're dying. 

So knowledge might come from reading or listening to Dharma, whereas wisdom is when you are able to act on that knowledge and apply it skillfully. 

It theorizes that it's an attempt to depict one of the "32 Signs of a Great Man", which it calls "a rather strange idea introduced into Buddhism at a later period", one of the signs being that "the Great Man’s hair was black and curled upwards and to the right". 

I'm not familiar with those texts or traditions. What I understood, just from the reading the quoted text (not from also reading other related texts), is: 

So, doesn't that imply meditation, but also alms-going etc.? The Buddha was human and was by that time practicing the Middle Way: therefore, I think, no asceticism. 

I guess the concept of emptiness makes that a meaningless question. If a thing isn't even itself (its own thing) to begin with, how could it stop being that or change? Maybe you can't identify what you're talking about: a thing, an element of a thing, a contact with an element, an experience of a contact, a description of an experience, etc.: "turtles all the way down". 

IMO there's a similar concern with people: outside my house I see people raising farm animals, in order to kill them for food. What should I do about that? Try to chase the people away? I think, probably not, even if only because I think that's likely to be ineffective (i.e. that kind of tactic on my part wouldn't stop people from killing). 

What the word means in English "Compassion" is from a Latin word, "co" meaning "with" and "pati/passio" meaning "suffer", so "compassion" means "suffer with". For example: 

I expect you'll want to investigate the author's claims in more detail (using the references which he cites). 

When someone dies (is pronounced dead, e.g. no heart-beat) then hospital staff will want to move the body to a refrigerated morgue. If you are next-of-kin, then when (after how long) is it right to give them permission to do that? Is it alright to do that nearly immediately, or, should you ask them to delay doing that, and if so for how long? This reference says, 

There's a similar tendency of the mind to bubble out words (internal or silent words): replaying old conversation, practicing new conversation, singing bits of song, etc. There are different senses (sight, sound, etc.) and Buddhism might talk of different consciousnesses for the different senses (e.g. "eye-consciousness", etc.). I view it as there being different sense-bodies or realms: e.g. there's an "eye-body of eye-consciousness", etc. Eye and ear are two of the most dominant or most popular senses, in "modern society": when people go to school, they're taught to read and write, figure out equations, and look at pictures; and to talk, and listen, and play music, and so on. The sense of touch is somewhat deprecated, unused, untaught. Words like haptic and proprioception exist but they're not everyday vocabulary. Nevertheless I think there's a "body" of sensory nerves and touch-consciousness, like there's a eye-body and a word-body (or "logic-body"). In the question Awareness of two things I quoted an experiment which I think shows that awareness or attention can move very quickly -- several times per second -- from one thing (or rather, one focus) to another. I find that when I try to concentrate on breathing, that's not engaging or interesting enough and my mind wanders ... maybe it wanders several times per second. Maybe it wanders to that place which is bubbling proto-images ... and easily gets caught there, swept up into a developing image. So (apart from opening your eyes so that light, the external eye, drowns out the internal images), another way to avoid this problem might be to try to set your default focus, your resting attention, on your feeling-body -- i.e. on your sense of touch, your haptic/proprioception body -- instead of on your (usual/default) eye-consciousness. Be aware that there is a body, to start with -- limbs, back, head balanced on top, gravity, heart, etc. Be aware of breathing and, in the instants when you're not aware of breathing, whenever there's not enough breathing to catch your attention, or not enough change of breathing (I think senses/consciousness is more sensitive to whatever is changing than to whatever is staying the same) then revert back to being aware of the body (rather than e.g. aware of internal images or internal monologue). Traditional advice (about setting your attention on your body) is to set your attention at your nose. I beware of contradicting that advice, but maybe the nose is too close to the head, so it's easy to get lost in thought. Maybe instead you could put that attention on your abdomen, for example, instead of your nose: e.g. on the lower dantian. I can place my attention on the sensations of my abdomen rising and falling but that is a felt sense not a visual sense. I find I pay attention to one thing at a time: for example if a passenger is talking to me then I might have momentary lapses of attention when driving a car -- or that I can switch between two or more things, but just a few things "simultaneously" are enough to fill my attention. I find there are a lot of sensations in the feeling-body: not only breathing but heart beating, balancing gravity, etc. -- i.e. "reality" -- maybe enough stimulation to displace "imagination". 

Because it's such a broad (not well-defined) concept I think the question is too broad to be answered in more detail. 

Language is a "system of communication". It might be like "a bridge over a river" or "two people holding hands". There might be a limit to what or how much can be communicated, but language can be as much "bridge" as it is "barrier". On the other hand, the part of one's mind which communicates using language can (I guess) be mistaken as the 'self' or 'ego'. Language is a sensory (conditioned) phenomenon. Some meditative practices (e.g. "guarding senses" etc.) may be intended to reduce one's dependence on communication. 

I try to experience (to get feedback from) the form and the feeling. See also this list of 'fundamental principles' which you're supposed to obey no matter which form or movement of the form you're doing ... on top of which, there are forms to learn and practice (I'm linking to Chen-style but I suppose other styles are similar). when people usually do thai chi what are they thinking about exactly Maybe it depends on how adept you are. When you're learning to speak (a non-tonal language), one of the things you concentrate on the sound of syllables. What does "oo" sound like? What does "b" sounds like? What about "boo"? Similarly a tai chi beginner learns many syllables (fragments of movement), like, what's it like to "push your hand forward while rotating the wrist but keeping your shoulder down and back": what does it feel like and how do you do it? Also you might practice just one move from a form, as a drill, for example, "wave hands like clouds"; or a drill, like, "peng lu ji an". Then you learn a 'form' which is a sequence of moves (e.g. this sequence). You have to learn and practice each move in sequence: how to do it (what the components of the move are), how it starts, what's in the middle, how it ends, what the next move will be, what it's called, and what the 'practical' purpose of the move is. You may (optionally) be naming each move (e.g. "Buddha's Warrior Attendant Pounds Mortar") as you do it; and/or the teacher may be naming each move (to try to remind students which is the current move). Unless you're a learner or a teacher though, I don't think to try to label in this way, though of course you're more-or-less aware of what you're doing. When I first learned the form I was told to just "breathe naturally". After I had learned the (external) form (sequence of moves) well enough to be able to practice it, I started to learn how/when to breathe when practicing it, i.e. exhaling during a push and breathing in when contracting, i.e. to integrate breathing. So now when I practice the form, I think of it as a sequence of balanced breaths:
