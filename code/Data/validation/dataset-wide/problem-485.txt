Well, it depends… Would you be happier cleaning a bunch of stuff out and getting a shiny new bike that reflects all you've learned? One that will "just work," or Would it be a fun project to build up a bike from scratch? Would it feel good to know that you'd "built it yourself?" Do you have the time for the project? Is it ok with you to get stuck and make some mistakes – probably "wasting" some time and/or money? If you decide to build, there are likely to be some unexpected "gotchas" along the way. So it is worth doing some reading and searching to see if others have run into similar problems. Sheldon Brown has a good piece on Upgrading Older Road Bicycles that may help you start thinking about the possible problems. Overtime the morass of bicycle standards has sorted itself out (a bit) so some of the problems that he mentions may not be issues. If you're looking at a frame you may find that the builder/seller publishes the key specs so that you can buy the correct parts. The specs will help you identify where the problems may lie. Some of the ones that come immediately to mind are: 

The answer to my second question is that the adapter converts an ISO rotor into a Center Lock rotor (as opposed to converting a Center Lock hub into an ISO hub) – in other words the adapter will need to be moved from rotor to rotor, it can not be left on the hub as you change rotors. This adapter uses a Hollowtech II bottom bracket tool (e.g., the Park BBT-9) to engage the outside of the lock ring rather than a cassette remover. That was a bit of a surprise, though I could have noticed it if I'd looked carefully at at the photos. On the other hand there is no need that I see to use the supplied lock ring, so I just used the old one which has the internal splines for the cassette remover. Also, the bolts are Torx T-15 rather than the T-20 I was expecting. 

Peter White is the US importer for Busch & Müller lights and is very knowledgeable about them – and they seem to have about the best prices on them. He also has photos comparing the beam patterns on his website. One way to reduce cost a bit is with a [sidewall dynamo][6] (aka bottle generator). These cost about the same amount as a low-end hub generator (US $50 plus a mount which runs $10 to $15) and save the cost of building a wheel. The downside of the sidewall dynamos is that they require friction on the tire sidewall and may slip in icy conditions. Ideally the tire will be built with a reinforced sidewall for longevity. Some of the better models have a choice of drive wheels so that you can use a more aggressive one in the winter. 

Getting the spoke tensions high & even is on of the most important things – balanced tension makes the wheel stable, high tension keeps the loads on the wheel structure fairly constant as it rolls which helps to prevent spoke breakage. You can get reasonably close by pitch and ear (pluck the spokes and listen to the pitch). If you have a ear that doesn't hear pitch there is a nice iPhone app called Spoke Tension Gauge that does the job for like $5 US. 

A lot of the time I don't… Most of my riding is on an older touring bike with downtube shifters or a tandem with mountain bike type (the two button/lever kind) shifters. So I know generally what gear the bike is in by effort and like Michael says detect cross-chaining by sound. With the touring bike shifter position tells me a lot about what gear I'm in and I can read it by feel. On the tandem I can tell the extremes by the shifter behavior (it either won't let you pull cable or won't release anymore). I also have a pretty relaxed attitude towards cross-chaining. I know it is "bad" and try to avoid it, but I also don't worry too much about occasionally picking the "wrong" gear combinations. I usually notice them due to noise or feel and when I do I shift if I can. If I can't a put a bit of money into the bike parts jar when I get home. 

It's hard to tell exactly what was done and why – it would help to know the original and new tire sizes. But what it looks like is that the shop added inline barrel adjusters to your brake cables. That's consistent with your description as well. They probably added them because the release levers on the brakes didn't give enough clearance to remove/install the wheels with the new tires without having to undo the cable clamp bolts. This is to make it easy for you to repair flats and the like. I would have expected the shop to contact you and tell you that the new tires were too wide to work with your current brakes and offer you options for the solution. One solution would have been to use a narrower tire, another is adding the barrel adjusters. 

Once you know how much clearance you have you can get a pretty good idea of how a larger tire will fit. The "other" dimension on the tire is, roughly speaking, the diameter of the cross section on of the tire – imagine the wheel as a pizza, if you cut a slice and look at it from the side the tire is the outer crust (the thick round part), the 23 or 32 is the diameter of the "roll" of crust at the outer edge. So, for you, to be able to go from a 23 mm tire to a 32 mm tire you need about 9 mm of extra radial clearance (clearance between the top of the tread and the fork crown and bridges) and about 4.5 mm of lateral clearance (between the tire walls and the fork and stays). I call this "extra" clearance because you want to maintain some additional space to allow for an untrue wheel and for junk that gets picked up by your wheels as you ride. On my Trek 620 I've got maybe 5 or 6 mm between the fork crown and my tire (they weren't thinking about fenders when they designed that bike), but 10-12 mm on the sides – aside from the fender issue that seems adequate (although it might not be if I was riding tires with a large open tread that tended to pick up rocks. The final issue to keep in mind is that while the tires are spec'd as if they were round in cross section, many are not – the Schwalbe Marathon line for example is more oval than round, they account for this in their ISO sizes (they use the larger number, which on these tires is the radial dimension), but use the smaller size in the "700c" measurement. For example the 700x35c Marathon is a 37x622 in the ISO size. So to run this tire you'd need more "extra" radial clearance than side clearance. 

Seems to me that these days the easy solution to this problem would be either to add an accelerometer to the light or if the bike had a Bluetooth or ANT+ speed sensor to use the signal to detect deceleration and then use that to run the brake light. I don't know of any lights that do that (but I haven't been looking since I'm using the B&M dynamo powered brake light), but it seems like it shouldn't be too expensive to add the functionality to a battery powered light – at least not compared to either a dynamo system or the costs and hassle of adding a brake light switch. 

Putting in a tube changes the role of the tire from air container to tube restrainer. That cut doesn't look too bad – but do look at the inside to see how much damage was done. If the threads of the casing are cut I think you may have trouble keeping the cut from growing. I think the biggest problem you'll run into here is that the sidewalls are going to flex a lot and it may be necessary to have some kind of mechanical patch to prevent the cut from reopening if you continue running the tires without tubes. If that is your front tire, I'd think about moving it to the back if you try patching it. The consequences of a blowout on the front are much worse that the rear. BTW - clever move to put the bike on its side to get the sealant to work. 

Do you want to be able to shift between the chainrings? It kind of sounds like you do. To do that you need slack in the chain so that the front derailer can move it between the rings, and you need a way to take up that slack as the size of the front chainring changes. That is one of the roles of the rear derailer. So assuming that you don't already have a rear derailer or chain tensioner you'd need to add one of those at the very least. Other than that (and possibly adding a front derailer) I can't see why it wouldn't work. I'm sorry, but I don't know where you can get the triple in India. You may need to replace the crank arms as well to be able to mount all three rings. 

No, you can run lower pressure on wider tires. Think about it this way: you need a certain amount of force holding the rims up off of the road. You can get if from a small contact patch and a lot of pressure or from a larger contact area and a lower pressure. But as you increase the width of the rim the tire goes from an approximation of a circle to a box to a thin sheet of rubber – you loose the flexibility of the sidewalls that comes from the more or less circular shape of a properly matched tire to rim. 

The levers in the first post that you linked to appear to be Cane Creek Crosstop (interrupter) levers. Tektro, Paul, and probably others as well, also make levers like this. They usually work by pressing on the cable housing (effectively making it longer), which is split at the lever. It looks like the levers in the photo are being used as conventional levers and are pulling on the cable itself – the cable appears to dead ends in the barrel adjuster of the levers rather than passing through as it would in a conventional interrupter lever setup. 

I purchased a Shimano SM-RTAD05 Center Lock disc rotor adapter, so now I can – at least partially – answer the question. 

If you need them fender and rack upgrades would be on the list. Looks like you already have a kickstand, so nothing to do there. Get a basic tool kit and a way to carry it and make sure you can lock up your bike. Have fun! Commuting by bike changes your relationship with your community – almost always for the better. 

So, I'm thinking that this is a bike that was originally setup with an 8-speed drive train. At some point the previous owner replaced the rear wheel with one built around a 10-speed hub. If I'm reading Sheldon Brown's page on hub and cluster compatibility correctly you should be able to mount an 8-speed cassette on a 10-speed free hub body. So it seems like all that is required is to put the pieces together, perhaps with a spacer behind the cassette. Or am I missing something? 

You can get lights that are powered by a dynamo (generator) in the front hub. Combined with bright LED front and rear lights you get excellent visibility (both seeing and being seen) and very little maintenance. The downside is that the equipment is not inexpensive – figure you'll need to spend at least $250 US for a front wheel, headlight and taillight. My personal opinion is that dynamo light are a huge improvement over battery lights – because you don't have to worry about batteries running down or loosing capacity in cold weather. Not having to worry about batteries means that you can run the lights all the time too. The downsides of dynamo lights are that you take a small hit in terms of drag (the power it takes to run the lights) and that they are harder to remove. The latter means that your bike is a bit more of a target for thieves. Dynamo lights are common in Europe and good ones will likely exceed German specs – from the bit of research that I did before buying my lights the German specs don't require a very bright headlight. I ride a lot on unlit roads and really appreciate a much brighter light, the brightness also helps keep the road visible when there are oncoming cars. I do a fair bit of night riding and good lights completely transform the experience. For reference here's what I'm using: 

For a road bike the quill / threadless adapter size it is almost certain to be 22.2 mm (0.874"). When people talk about a 1" steering tube 1" is the OD, the ID which is the actual size of the stem is usually 22.2 mm. The description of the adapter will call it a 1" to 1 1/8" or a 22.2 mm to 28.6 mm adapter. When you install it you don't need the spacers under the stem that would be used in a normal threadless setup. To me the look took some getting used to, but I loved being able to swap handlebars without having to strip everything off one side. 

No, it is by no means universal. Frames are built with a maximum tire size in mind. Some bike include a maximum size in their specs, so you might check to see. Otherwise, it is easy enough to figure out. Since you have tires on the bike already, you can check the existing clearance and get a very good idea of what will fit. Start by measuring the clearances. Here's where to look: 

Good luck! If you're starting with a bike in decent condition and aren't riding it too hard, I'd guess that if you take care of the items I mentioned above the bike will do just fine. Your weight is going down after all. I wasn't as heavy as you when I started riding again – but I was up there (on the far side of 260). I started on the bike I had – an old steel Trek 530 frame with 32 mm tires (the biggest I could fit into the frame). I'm starting to think I'll be able to break 200 this year. If you're looking for ideas about getting started on riding again, I'd highly recommend Grant Peterson's book Just Ride. There is good thinking about riding for the joy of it and also some ideas to get you thinking about how to exercise effectively. 

When you think about the time involved it is worth thinking about the "total cost" – all of the costs (in time) that go into your commute. For example: 

I'm sure the list could go on and I was intentionally avoiding issues of different conditions. Plus, I'd bet that there is an element of loving the debate as well. 

I think the only thing that you're missing is the knowledge that the part that anchors the cable (with the hole) is free to rotate. One way to get it to go back is to take the end of the brake cable and catch the edge of the socket or slot and then drag the cable out again. Usually this will get the "socket part" to spin back around the way it should be facing and you can drop the cable in for real.
