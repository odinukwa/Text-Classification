So, the answer your question of "how far can you go," depends on two things: 1) how, exactly, you define coercion and 2) the potential coercee's willingness to change their mind. 

If you agree with Hobbes, Locke, and Kant, you're more or less golden as their views on what is and is not coercive agree with Aquinas'. You're not coercive until you have to violently impose something on someone. Mill is trickier. Even having fines for say, littering, implies coercion. Of course, he argues that it's necessary, but it's coercive nonetheless. It would be difficult to influence anyone one way or another without any leverage. Primary source reading: Mill's On Liberty. Nozick - Coercive threats and (no) unsuccessful instances of coercion Nozick says a lot about coercion and I would do you a great disservice if I tried to simplify his position here. Parts of his argument that I think are relevant (and revolutionary) are the following: 

I only introduced the Liar Paradox to show how deep unsolvability can go. Your question, however, is a much simpler breed. Consider E1: 

If I pick , the statement being true leads to the conclusion that the statement is indeed false (S). If I pick , the statement being false leads to the conclusion that the statement is indeed true (¬S). So the statement is either both true and false or neither true nor false and the question is unanswerable. The unsolvability of the Liar Paradox question, however, can be easily rectified. 

is already an atomic sentence in FOL=. It evaluates to true. If you wanted, you could get unnecessarily complicated and say something like but this idea is already incorporated into what does. Equality in FOL (or SOL for that matter) is defined outside of the logic (in metalogical terms as an equivalence class, yadda yadda) so we can just use it out of the box. Set theory does something a bit funkier with equality (of sets), but vanilla FOL/SOL doesn't know anything about sets. 

Also, when looking at a power set ℘(S) of a set S, there is only one element in ℘(S) that's simply S. Consider Then L is only equivalent to the last discrete element in ℘(L), so I guess one could axiomize since the same holds for countably infinite sets (and I think uncountably infinite sets, as well but I could be wrong). I don't think there needs to be any distinguishing between L and (in our case) the last element of ℘(L) as they represent the same "thing" - in one case L is a set made up of discrete "things" and in the second, L itself is a "thing" inside a larger set. I don't think this breaks Bell's discreteness (or Set Theory, for that matter). If your question was about breaking set identity (which Bell argues is simply the number of elements - also known as cardinality) when using the power set, worry not! Directly from Wikipedia: 

So, according to Nozick, you can influence anyone insofar as you don't threaten them (or obviously don't actually violently abuse them) IFF the threat leads to their action being dictated by you. It seems like a silly thing to say, but it makes a lot of sense. Check out this simple thought experiment. 

This presentation, I think, will answer most of your questions about the inscription. In short: Plato probably didn't inscribe anything himself. Was there something inscribed above the academy? We don't know. The inscription story began in the 4th century when it was mentioned directly by Julian the Apostate in 362 and tangentially by Sopater of Apamea. So the earliest records of such an inscription are dated more than 700 years after the academy was founded - which should speak to the lack of their gravitas. Of course, it's a nice story :) 

Edit: This answer has sprung up a lot of discussion. I believe I am right for several reasons, one being that what is described here could be described as a form of The Problem of Rational Choice - it's a well defined problem in many philosophy papers, including Isaac Levi's On Indeterminate Probabilities (1974). It's also covered by statisticians in some regard, ex: Indeterminate Probabilities on Finite Sets (Robert F. Nau - 1992). 

You need to be careful. There is no such thing as a logical connective between more than two propositions. There are no ternary (or n-ary where n > 2) connectives in non-exotic logics, only unary (negation) and binary (conjunction, disjunction, implication, etc.) ones. As always, doing truth tables helps illustrate the concept: First, this is how you want to work with two inputs (in fact, this is how it actually works): 

I have it and it's great. One of my favorite introductory logic books. It's not as formal as the others. It's easy to get bogged down in symbolic formalisms and lose sight of what you're actually trying to accomplish. It primarily focuses on language, not logic (that is, modeling natural language as opposed to mathematical logic). To me, it seems that this is what your goal is. In other words, it's more like reading Frege than Gödel. Sam Cumming is brilliant, and I've taken four or five courses with him during my time at UCLA. He was by far my favorite professor. 

Set theory says that |N| = |Ne| = |No| - that is, the cardinality of the set of natural evens is equivalent to that of the set of natural odds and to that of the set of all naturals. This can be confusing because Ne and No are subsets of N. However, that doesn't really seem to be a problem for Bell. In a sense, you're right to worry about |N| = |Ne| = |No|. How can we say that the even numbers are the same thing as the odd numbers? Well, it looks like Bell argues that all sets of cardinality ℵ0 or greater are abstract sets (as opposed to concrete sets like ). So you could say L possesses the attribute a, but you could not say Ne possesses the attribute . So then how can we know that is in Ne? Well, Bell, at the bottom of pg. 10, shows us how to create a relation between two abstract sets. In our case, it would maybe be . So, going back to your question (and comment), there is no way to distinguish between two sets if they have the same cardinality unless we map them. So until we specify that the set of all even naturals maps to and the set of all odd naturals maps to , the two are identical.
