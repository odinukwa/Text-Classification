I think this will take you too far with the body contempletion meditation. And if nothing works contemplate on this story of buddha. 

The very first point is to make sure you are not doing it for Ego gratification. The purpose of 'debate' per se is to win over other. However this should not be the case. You should try in utmost polite language to get your poibt across. If the other party still hold on to their opinion you should end it up as just that-- 'their opinion'. Make sure the dialogue exchanged contributes to exchange of knowledge and you both together end up with broadened line of thinking. Dont use Ad Hominem arguments. If the debate gets centered around things which cannot be proved or confirmed no matter what...for e.g. you enter into debate 'wheater there really is a heavenly or hellish realm as told in scriptures or its just a metaphor'. Now no amount of intellectual and logical thought exchange is going to settle that. In such cases dont go into debates. Its a waste of time and mental energy and moreover it leads the sangha nowhere. 

Hereditary illness or not...the offspring you will produce will become old, fall ill and die. The dukkha is inevitable. We may as well say that dukkha is hereditary to all humans so should we have kids? If your intention in having a child is good, if the child is born out of love and not lust, if child is born not out of any form of sexual misconduct...then you will be fine...there will be no bad kamma. 

The concept of rebirth is an axiomatic corolary of 'Karma'. Also if rebirth does not exist then nibbana i.e. 'blowing out' doesn't make sense. For e.g. without rebirth and without afterlife in heaven or hell you will be essentially 'blown out' nibbanafied without doing anything. So nibbana makes sense only because rebirth exist, because in rebirth the flame continues. Also, murdering sentient beings (in a painless way) would also be equivalent to liberating them from suffering if rebirth does not exist. So it is a pretty central doctrine, even if you don't emphasize on Karma. 

Because Samsara is Nirvana (this is something I learned in Zen). Also not focusing on people who are not of profit to you or not yours shows selfishness and will bolster your ego. Remember the Jataka tales and remember all the sacrifice the Buddha did in His previous life for other beings, out of compassion. 

I read on some online page that the time before going to bed and immediately after waking up is benificial to meditation. I searched over internet but there aren't any specific instructions about any such Buddhist practise. Is this true? Is there any special meditation we can do in this time? 

Are you not practicing mindfulness? Absent-mindedness is not something for a meditator. You should be aware. Later on, you will regret if only I would have been listening to him... 

Kamma is largly based on intention...in both the cases you have given the intention is not clear. Moreover Kamma is not some measurable quantity that can be quantified...so you cannot ask such questions like whose Kamma is more bad... 

Further to the answers to this question, I want to understand what literally is 'see things as they are' or as the sutta states, Yathā-bhūta-ñāna-dassana. My questions are, 

May be Hon. Subhuti was in some way pedantic about the use of word 'recognised' and 'perceived'. So you can't perceive a Buddha through 32 characteristic...as in may be all of them cant be preceived by everyone of us straight away. And if perceived then you can recognize a Buddha. But this looks like a reasoning based on semantics and not on wisdom. 

I am glad that people here were considerate while stating their opinions about Osho. Osho cannot be considered Buddhist in traditional sense as He did and said many things that Buddha didnt recommend from an Enlightened being like lavish life style, music, singing, dancing etc But from an another vantage pount he really really was buddhist rather than anyone else... He stressed on becoming a Buddha yourself rather than following anything at all...which really the Buddha would have stressed that get enlightened yourselves... Osho stressed highly on meditation...which is really the Buddhist way to become arahant along with other things... Osho's comnentry on heart sutra, diamond sutra, dhammapada...is unparalled...He is only contemporary teacher who have spoken on Thervada, Mahayana, Zen, Vajrayana, Buddhist Tantra... He made his Sannasins wear a maroon robes like the tibetean buddhists...ok not yellow...but similar to tibeteans... Osho synthesized many things... He talked of rebirth, impermenance, no self, and dukkha...amongst othet things... So I really see their no reason why He cant be called a Buddhist....but he himself hated being pegion holed...so rather not call him a buddhist... But more and more I understand Buddhism...I understand that self is an illusion...so even calling my self a buddhist is somewhere wrong... 

If someone run past you and some chasing him with weapons ask you if you saw him or not, seeing the danger that he is in you might want to lie but if you do not lie he might get hurt. While lying is deceit, if it saves a life, can that not be considered a wholesome act? Recently while visiting one of the Sea Shepherd ships, I noticed a Buddhist statuette that was gifted from the Dalai Lama. While the sea shepherd ships stand between whales and other species that need their protection, the Dalai Lama himself is quoted as saying, in reference to Sea Shepherd tactics, 'when protecting life, it is not a [sin] to cause damage, as the life is more valuable'. I would consider this to be in the same league as lying to someone who is going to cause serious injury or death. You are protecting life. In Buddhist teachings it is the intention that is of utmost importance in may areas of life decisions. If your boss call you and ask if one of your Co-workers said something bad about the boss, you will have to be truthful but in doing so you break a precept as you are using your word to make two people dislike each other. This would be the equivalent of 'gossip' I would say. I have been put in this situation before and my answer was "the two of you need to sort your own business out and not involve others". In these kind of situations can we imagine some other thing and answer thinking i'm answering in reference to my imagination and skip the breaking of precepts? Like saying i did not saw the man who ran away, thinking "There is no such being called me in reality, also there is no man who ran away in reality either"? This would be very bad for you. At the end of the day your 'intention' is deception when you think this way. This can form a bad habit as you deceive yourself even more than you deceive the other people. As my example above, you don't have to lie, there are always other options. For example, with the man chasing the other man, you could ask him instead "what is wrong" "can I help you", maybe he is chasing a man who hurt his child, or a robber. There are many options to be considered, and delving into the situation to gain better understanding would be better than deceiving yourself. 

My research and practice of meditation in this area is something I have internally debated for many years also. Comparing Zen, which is extracted from the Mahayana Tradition comparing it to my first love and study of the Theravada tradition. Firstly the major differences that I have traced between Mahayana and Theravada is that Mahayana, is essentially a revised and blended system. Mixed with Taoism and Confusion (i don't think I spelt that correctly but anyway). There are many mystic and magical things written and adopted within Mahayana that are not present with Theravada which is the written adoption of what was taught originally by Gautama Buddha. Whether you follow one or the other, or Zen or Vajrayana it doesn't matter, as long as you yourself are compassionate and a good person. The major difference I have discovered is the approach to your own salvation. Theravada emphasizes you cultivate through meditation and compassion towards Buddhahood and then when you have reached where you can, you help others. Like climbing over a tall wall, you get up and then help other get up there with you. Mahayana on the other hand has the opposite approach, first you help others as you travel the path so that they may reach their own enlightenment. With Zen the approach seems to be neither here nor there with the path. Adopted from Ch'an with the Japanese strictness and systematic approach it focuses on a very deep foundation of meditation through which you achieve clarity. With this clarity one then is able to see things in a different light and able to help others. If I were to classify myself I would be Theravadin, however I practice Zen style breathing meditation. If Zen and Mahayana and Theravada where a venn diagram they would all overlap with each other with with areas distinct to each. The only thing I can recommend, which Gautama Buddha himself teaches, is that you study and practice meditation. I believe that if you study deeply into one of doctrines and understand it, then you will be able to study the next and so forth. Always comparing will cause confusion and distress in your mind and you won't be able to understand any of them at the end of the day. As the Buddha said, question everything and make sure that it aligns with your own morals. I hope this helps. 

Meaning, all the politics, hatered, war in this world will always continue you need not heed them and instead you should work towards your own salvation... 

Vipassana needs higher levels of concentration and mindfulness. Instructions for Vipassana are little bit more complicated and difficult to follow than Samatha. Vipassana involves using the mind to sense the bodily feelings. Mind usually wanders. Learning Vipassana for first time requires a 10 day commitment to a retreat. But Samatha meditation can be learned at a days retreat. 

You will not incur bad Karma for your actions because your intentions are not per se to deliberatly cause sufferring to living beings. In case you are doing research so as to make money i.e. develop a product which can be sold to masses based on your plant-insect interactions, then it comes under wrong livelihood. But as I assume you are doing this for your degree so Karma will be merciful. Now, how can you approach this, so before killing the insect you give it your kindness and compassion. You ask it to be forgiven as you have no other choice. And you kill it with minimal suffering incured by the insect. 

As I have understood, Heavenly and Hellish realms are determined by state of mind. It is well said that two people can be walki g down the same street and one is in hell and other is in heaven. Heaven and hell is the way we experience this universe. So if you do meditation and you get born in a monastry world setting and it is still heavenly as it will all be experienced. 

I understand that if I am looking at a beautiful woman, I am obviously not seeing as she is, but what when I am looking at a clear blue sky, not clouded by ignorance, lust, and greed, am I seeing things as they are? Or I should necessarily have to have insight into Three marks of existencece? Can I see things as they are without Enlightenment? If so, can only an enlightened being see things as they are? Sometimes when we look at a flower we can see something transcendental, something which is greater than the sum of the parts. (Not a concept from Buddhism) but some people have an aura around them, even the Buddha in pictures is shown with an aura around His head. So does seeing this metaphysical reality constitute seeing thins as they are? 

I am riddled by this question lately and it necessary for my progress on path of Dhamma. My question is, why is it that in this life time I have became obsessively bent to attain nibbana while everyone around me is living in total oblivion. I mean if I had so many rebirths in past lives exactly what was I doing all these quantillion lives, was I never told the dhamma. If I was told, then why am I not already enlightened. Was I dumb or something all these lives not to have awaken to the truth of suffering? What must have been my mistake all these lives? How can I rectify that mistake so that I can felicitate my nibbana in this life? 

Meet old people be aware of their bodies, facial features especially, pay attention to the wrinkled skin, stinky weak teeth, bad eye sight, feel the repulsiveness. If you ever happen to be in India visit the place called Varanasi, its the dead body burning ghat for the hindus. Not only they burn it they also just throw it in river to rot, if they are poor. There are also half burned bodies all over. See that sight. Try and attend a stomach surgery or a post mortem at a hospital. 

As I have learnt in S.N. Goenka's Vipassana course, you have to be aware of normal breath only. If you are not able to concentrate on breath in normal mode only then you make a forced breathing to be long or short. So the normal is norm. 

People who have done wrong to me remain in my memory and continuously stay in my mind. I have feelings of ill will and hatered towards them...to revenge...how do I get out of the feelings of ill will...
