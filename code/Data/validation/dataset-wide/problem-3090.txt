The answer to your question is found right there. White slave owners knew that "a large force of slaves" was a dangerous thing. They took action to ensure that slaves could not organize. 

Unfortunately, those don't reveal much. There are also lengthy answers filled with editorial opinion that perhaps aren't illuminating to those who aren't familiar with either the political or economic predjudices of the author. At the time, Britain was a signatory to the Breton Woods System, under which all the signatory nations attempted to peg their exchange rates relative to one another. In order to maintain the relationship between exchange rates, Britain had to buy and sell pounds sterling, using the gold and silver reserves stored at the Bank of England. Why was there pressure on the pound sterling? Simply people wanted less Pounds Sterling and more dollars; they were selling Pounds Sterling to buy dollars. In order to prop up the value of the Pound Sterling the BoE was forced to buy Sterling. (Currency is a good like any other; when there are more sellers than buyers, the price falls; when there are more buyers than sellers, the price rises. If you want the price to rise, you're going to have to pay more than market price for the good). BoE had no other currency reserves, so it had to trade specie (gold & silver) for currency (Pounds Sterling). There is a limit to how long they can do that. The problem with the Breton Woods System (if I can try to express it in a few sentences) is that the political goal of managing exchange rates was divorced from the real meaning of the exchange rates. Britain could no longer maintain the unrealistic value of the pound sterling and had to devalue. The value of money is ultimately what you can buy with it. If I want to buy British goods, I need to pay in Pounds Sterling. If I want to buy American goods, I need to buy in US Dollars. If American goods are more desireable than British goods, I'll sell my Sterling to buy dollars. Treaties among politicians are helpless against the force of the invisible hand. 

Vitus Bering led two seaborne expeditions to explore the Russian Far East. On the second expedition, he founded Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky by building a "City-Nativity" church [Богородско-Рождественской церкви] there. Presuming that it held services, which clergymen were there? 

In Imperial Russia, "white" priests (as opposed to "black" monks) of the non-noble clergy ministered to the Orthodox public. Entering this profession meant entering a new social class; it did not require celibacy. Since the job involved using written materials, priests had to be literate. The Orthodox liturgical language was Church Slavonic, somewhat different from modern Russian. As French was the prestige language of the time, it too was widely studied in seminaries. Apart from languages, surely the seminary students focused on mysteries, rituals, commentaries, etc. I'm interested in things around the year 1800. How much education did local priests have in Imperial Russia? Did all priests attend seminaries, or could those at the frontier skip a formal education? What qualifications were needed to become a priest? 

Even the involuntary response to cover your face if something is flying at you is predicated on a cause and effect, i.e., two events taking place in sequence. By this definition it seems to me that time was "found out about" before humans were even involved. 

Apparently there is no consensus among scholars on this one, and several Pacific coast cultures substantially resisted Russian encroachment. 

Dr. Peter Smith cared for the indigent in 1850 San Francisco, and the city paid him in interest-bearing scrip. Soon he was owed $64,000 and the city was forced to make repeated sales of real property to pay him back. According to Nancy Taniguchi's "Dirty Deeds", Senator David Broderick bought many of the "Smith lots". With that terrific amount of money, where did Dr. Peter Smith go, and what did he do? 

I've deferred answering this because it is a complicated subject, and I can't find the right sources. My impression is that the founding fathers didn't share a coherent opinion on the subject; different states and their respective founding fathers had different opinions. However yesterday, I heard the following paragraph read aloud 

1) Long before Rome fell it had abandoned Republicanism. After Diocletian and the Crisis of the Third Century the Emperors no longer felt any need to consult with the Senate. The Senate's role in government and in the legitimacy of the Empire was symbolic. This is the first flaw in the question - the transition between Republic and Monarchy occurred during the Roman Empire. 2) Greek Democracy fell to the Macedonians, although a more full discussion would include that (a) the Greeks abandoned democracy themselves more than once, and (b) Greek Democracy was actually an oligarchy - voting rights were invested in a small minority of the inhabitants. 3) Europe didn't pursue absolute monarchy for centuries. In the comments many others have noted that the governance model from the fall of Rome to the rise of absolute monarchy explored a variety of models. Most common, as I recall, was for those who wielded effective military power to select one of their number to exercise leadership, but that selection was limited and revocable. 4) Ultimately Monarchy wins out for a couple of reasons. Democracy and Republics suck at war. War requires effective command, and Democracy tends to provide a diffuse and inchoate command structure - Rome (and if I recall Greece) delegated to a dictator during a war. (I think one can argue that Democracy sucks at foreign policy in both peace and war.) Monarchy provides advantages for the organization and governance of societies of a specific size and technological level. hat tip to @bilbo_pingouin who suggested this revision Monarchy provides for a (relatively) stable succession, coherent governance, and strong effective states. Hat tip to @TheHonRose This changes somewhat in the modern age; @TheHonRose correctly points out that Churchill defeated Hitler; that democracies defeated empires in WWII. But OP is asking about a pre-modern time where war was fought & won with weapons is different from a modern time where war decided by industrial production. There is a fascinating essay there but (a) I'm not truly qualified to write it, and (b) it is non-responsive to OP's question. I'll stand with my thesis that during the pre-modern age, working with economies based on agriculture and land, that monarchy (and vassalage) is a more effective command and control institution. Rome was an aberration - Rome developed an educated class broad enough and deep enough to take advantage of a form of democracy, and an economic infrastructure that surpassed simple agriculture. (another interesting essay, but probably off topic). Update - It occurs to me that I've neglected to address the underpinning of OP's question. Why monarchy over democracy? Fukyama's Origins of Political Order argues that democracy requires some relatively sophisticated institutions. (I'm abridging a book into a sentence; I'm aware of the injustice I do to his argument). Democracy is built on the notion that the citizens trust the state. In an era of poor communications, and unbelievable wealth gaps, it is difficult to assemble any meaningful demos. (Stop whining about today's 1%'ers; imagine life in Charlemagne's time, when 99% of the population legally could not travel from their home and would almost never speak to anyone outside their home village.) Greek democracy worked because it was a tiny oligarchy of citizens who knew one another. The same was true for the Roman Senate - a small coterie of families who knew one another, supported by tribes (who claimed kinship). Rome couldn't maintain the cohesion and degenerated to an absolutist monarchy, followed by a military dictatorship. There was no hope to build the kinds of institution and societal trust mechanisms that would enable democracy in societies with that kind of weak communications and cooperation. 

There are about fifty blocks full of surveyed and zoned "water lots" in southeastern San Francisco -- property which is presently part of the San Francisco Bay. See these blocks on Zillow; 5000 square feet of bay seems to change hands for a few hundred dollars. Water lots in the port section of the city were once the subject of speculation and political drama. The city government was badly indebted and not supposed to draw or sell off water lots, but did so. Much of today's downtown is land that was once water lots. However, the filling never happened in the southeast. Whatever did happen may have been connected to the adjacent naval shipyard at Hunter's Point or the establishment of today's Candlestick Point State Recreation Area. When were these blocks and lots defined? 

Like many scholars before me, I am wondering if it's worth the trouble to read these documents. Citations to the manuscripts are pretty uncommon. Are the testimonials of Vallejo and Alvarado actually good sources on any particular topics? 

In what I can only hope is a coincidence, Lydia Black described a Black Legend about Russian Alaska, which was both started and countered in the United States. The introduction to her "Russians in Alaska" includes this story: 

In 1700s and 1800s California, a popular form of entertainment was a fight to the death between a bull and a grizzly bear, either tied together or tied to a post. (This practice may have been Horace Greeley's inspiration for naming bull and bear markets.) The California Grizzly went extinct in the 1920s. The last such fight in the town of Branciforte apparently took place in July, 1867. The San Mateo County Times-Gazette reported on one held in Castroville in September of the same year. Which fights, if any, came later? 

@ClintEastwood is correct, but I think understates the problem. The fundamental problem is that the Crown relies on colonial Governors for all executive functions. At one point (sorry - cannot locate source), the southeastern corner of Pennsylvania was claimed by Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York. Each of those colonies claimed to have the right to collect taxes there. The English colonial system had no way to resolve that conflict; the Governors were the agents of the Crown. Theoretically they could have appealed directly to the crown, but (a) while the appeal was in processes, they would each have been trying to assert their rights, (b) the Crown had no agents other than the Colonial government on site. On what basis would the Crown make a decision? All three Governors would assert that they were correct and the other two in error. (c) in general terms, it is always better to enforce your rights than to appeal to a higher power; the higher power may decide that your inability to enforce your rights means that the rights do not in fact exist. Although in law, the Governors were subject to the Crown, in practice they were independent. It was more rational and more prudent for colonial Governors to enforce their own rights. Remember that the British colonial system was not planned - it evolved. I don't have any information on colonial policy of non-British countries. Note: I'm aware that I've provided no sources; I shall look for some, but I'm not sure where. 

The vast majority of invasions & foreign wars. Whenever you choose to fight on foreign soil, you invoke a fairly dramatic handicap in logistics. If we limit the examination to conflicts where technology and equipment are roughly par, then distance to conflict becomes a significant discriminator in logistics. Defenders can count on frequent, if not ubiquitous resupply. 

Yes, the Franciscan priests did whip neophytes, according to Steven W. Hackel's "The Staff of Leadership: Indian Authority in the Missions of Alta California": 

Given its location and size this would have been a mature, if not record-setting, Coast Redwood. Apparently the Russians brought or made more advanced tooling for forestry than the Hispanic immigrants had done. Likely employing the same source but without saying so, Coast Redwood: A Natural and Cultural History (Evarts and Popper, eds.), says "...Russian craftsmen felled trees up to 20 feet in diameter..." 

In Spanish Alta California, most agricultural production was under the management and on the lands of the Franciscan Missions, operated with native labor. Each of the four presidios (forts) was also supposed to rely on a ranch belonging to the King -- the Ranchos del Rey. Monterey's corresponding royal ranch, for example, was located upriver, somewhat near the Missions of Soledad and San Juan Bautista. Who staffed or managed these royal ranchos? 

He was not, according to Donald Nuttall's 1972 paper "The Gobernantes of Spanish Upper California: A Profile": 

The Communists' common language was probably Mandarin. Beijing had been the Imperial capital during the preceding dynasties, and its local language became the administrative tongue of the empire -- the language in which civil servants worked. This implication is the origin of the word "Mandarin", referring to bureaucrats. Educated people in the rest of the country were then as now, more likely to understand Mandarin, than its speakers were to understand the other regional languages. 

The first Anza Expedition of 1775 brought some of the first Spanish-speaking colonists into Alta California. At least one baby was born en route. Did Anza or anyone else in his party write down everyone's names?
