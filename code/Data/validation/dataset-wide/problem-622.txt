You might have some luck with a seatpost mounted rack. You may need to raise the seat up a bit on your bike to get it to fit since it seems that there isn't much clearance there. However, these seatpost racks are not strong enough to support a child seat, and with a single point of failure I wouldn't even attempt it. But as a rack for your bike for carrying other things, this would work. As others have said, the fact that you have rear suspension makes it difficult to attach a rack since usually racks require 2 attachment points, which is hard (impossible??) when the back of the frame needs to move due to suspension. As far as baby seats go, you might want to opt for the Kangaroo child seat which has the seat located between you and the handlebars. Again for this, it looks as though you would have to move your seat up a bit. 

This might sometimes happen. The quick release is usually enough to make the pads wider than the tire, but this doesn't happen in every case. The pads should usually be about 2mm from the rim when everything is set up. If there is not enough room to remove your wheel after the quick release is used, you will have to loosen the cable. You can try doing this by loosening the barrel adjuster to see if that gives you the needed clearance, if not you may have to actually undo the cable, this is the least desirable solution as it makes things take a lot longer to get set up properly again. In most cases, people only remove their wheel when the tire is flat, and so, there shouldn't be any problem getting the tire past the brakes, as the tire can be squeeze and made narrower. If you have the tire fully inflated, it can be quite firm and hard to squeeze between the brake pads. Depending on the situation, you might want to remove the air from the tire before removing the wheel, or if you are fixing a flat, don't fully inflate the tire before you put it on the bike. 

It's a bottom bracket cup. There are specialty tools you can use to remove it such as the HCW-11 on this page, or if it isn't rusted in, you can probably accomplish the same with an adjustable crescent wrench. Under there are some ball bearings, so make sure you don't lose any when you open it up. The bearings should be in a cage, which would stop you from losing them, but with an older and worn bike such as the one shown in the picture, the bearing cage may be broken. 

The important thing to remember is that on a modern road bike, the frame is actually a small percentage of the overall weight of the bike. This frame, including the fork, is advertised at 3 pounds, while a bike built on the frame weighs in at 16.69 pounds. The frame is only 18% of the weight of the bike. Even if the frame which was a bigger size weighed 20% more, It would only bring the weight of the bike up by 3.6%. The weight for the above bike also includes the weight of the fork in the weight of the frame. Since the same fork is used for bikes of different sizes, the actual frame weight will contribute even less to the total weight of the bike. What mainly changes between different sizes is the size of the main triangle. I couldn't see the weight of 2 different frame sizes making up more than half a pound. I would recommend buying the bike that actually fits the best. Weight doesn't make as much as a difference as you think, especially if you aren't competing at the top level. 

The main problem I see with Gates Carbon Drive on a fat bike is that you have to have a frame that "breaks" in the rear triangle to accommodate threading the belt. Have you checked to make sure there's a frame available that supports fat bike tires and also supports breaking the chainstays. As far as off-roading goes, that would create a potential weak spot in the frame. Although I"m sure any quality bike manufacturer would account for that when building such a frame. 

Also look at touring bikes. Road and CX bikes are made for racing. Which means they have a quite aggressive fit which makes you lean over the handlebars quite a bit. Touring bikes are much more laid back and comfortable, while still being very efficient. They have room for racks, fenders, and big tires which can be nice for riding in the city. If the bike show you're dealing with focuses on the Specialized brand, then take a look at the Awol. If you are happy with Trek, then look at the 520. 

All Shimano road derailleurs (2400, Claris, Tiagra, 105, Ultegra, DuraAce) made for 7-10 speeds are compatible with eachother. The amount that the derailleur moves is determined by the shifter. With 11 speed they changed things up, so as long as the derailleur you chose was designed to work with 7-10 speeds you should be fine. For mountain derailleurs (Acera, Alivio, Deore) 7-9 speed derailleurs are compatible with the 7-10 road groupsets. A 9 speed Ultegra or even DuraAce can be found at 9 speeds if you find old enough equipment, but all current 105, Ultegra, and DuraAce are 11 speed and will therefore not be compatible with your current 9 speed setup. If you want to find a 105 9 or 10 speed derailleur, it won't be the current model, although the 10 speed 105 (5700), Ultegra (6700), or DuraAce (7900) is still readily available as a replacement part. As an aside, are you sure that upgrading the derailleur will really fix your problem? What kind of problems are you having with the Tiagra? Could it be an adjustment or bad cabling that's causing your shifting problems? Is your cassette or chain worn? 9 speed Tiagra is older equipment and it's possible that your chain or cassette are at the point where they should be replaced. I have 2400 (8 speed) level equipment, and find that it shifts quite well as long as the adjustment is good, and I usually don't need to adjust it very often. 

Assuming you have the Cycle Ops Fluid 2 trainer, which is what I have, you can use it with nutted wheels. The skewer that comes with it is just for bikes with fancy quick release skewers that don't fit into the trainer or if you have nice skewers that you don't want to scratch up. For nutted wheels, the retaining mechanism should fit fine over top of the nuts. Update Thanks for the picture. That isn't the Cycle Ops Fluid Trainer, so it looks like my previous info isn't really applicable. Some trainers aren't designed to work with nutted wheels. Looks like it's not only a problem with the way it mounts, but that your hub is too narrow. The mechanism looks like it's screwed all the way in, but it's still too loose. How much axle/bolt do you have sticking out from the nut? It looks like the part that's supposed go around the nut/skewer isn't very deep, and is probably meeting up with the end of the axle. You could probably cut it shorter to alleviate this problem, but that's probably not an optimal solution. There's a couple different adapters that I was able to find for using nutted axles in trainers linked below. It's difficult to tell if either one would work with your specific trainer. Forza Bolt Axle Adapter TACX axle nuts Even if you do manage to get it mounted properly, it might not work that well. I mounted my fixie on my trainer once, and there wasn't enough resistance. Fluid trainers generally don't have adjustable resistance (maybe yours does) and required that you change gears to adjust the resistance. I found that the gear on my fixie (46x15, which is higher than most) wasn't hard enough to give me a decent workout on my trainer.
