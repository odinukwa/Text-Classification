The following SELECT with INNER JOINS works, but does not count it right. I have a tests table: Tests 

But what happens when there two conditions required, namely the joint combo of (TestId, TestSubId)? Ie, what do I do for the IN clause, the ???, in the following to show it has to be in the combos (10,25) and (11,22): 

I had been doing the following in two stages in php, but now see that as cumbersome. I was collecting all the 'TestUsers' with the UserId = 25 and returning to the php code which then does a separate call the database and then alters the 'InactiveTestSlotBitwise' in the 'Tests' to show they had removed themselves from the Tests they were in. However, now I think I should be doing something else instead in one call, on the lines: 

I am having trouble loggin on to my Wamp phpMyAdmin. Those are other questions on this site at the moment. Is there any way to make a backup of my databases through the MySQL Console? 

2) This will open a pop-up window enter your in Server Name section or select a server name from the Drop down list. 3) Enter the . 

Replication Monitor: : OK : for both Agents and Status shows it is Running..... and Property says As it is obvious from the error message the Login is failing to get access to SQL Server, So just for test purpose I gave this SQLAgent account sysadmin role. Yet the error persist. All the material I can find online, suggests Giving more permissions to login will solve the issue. But if sysadmin role hasnt solved it, I have kind of ran out of ideas now. Can someone please suggest what is that I am missing? how can I fix it? Any suggestions or pointer in the right direction is much appreciated. Thank you. 

How can I remove this orphaned node of an old cluster? Any ideas any pointers are much appreciated, Thank you. 

I have another open question which at the moment seems to be a bit tricky to answer: phpMyAdmin - Cannot login even when changed password I am hoping someone can still answer it. I think one of the config files or ini files is wrong in some way. So I need to ask this question as a back up. I have a few databases in my present install of Wamp server on Windows 10. Can I reinstall, or do a repair-install, on this Wamp server without overwriting or deleting my databases? 

It gave the following (note I am localhost:8080 and not just localhost - could that make a difference? 

We are told to watch out for things being set to null (we dont want) by using the IN clause in the following: 

The Rank will only change about once a day. However, the page will likely be viewed maybe 1000 times a day. So instead of getting the database to calculate the rank for each of the 1000 visits, I thought it would be best to just fill the 'Rank' column once. How can I include an UPDATE to fill the Rank column, using my chosen way to rank people. (Note if two people are ranked 5, then the next rank is 7.) 

No row is ever update nor deleted. As you can imagine table grows huge in very short time. The table is queried as well time to time. SELECT statements with filtering on DATETIME column and sometimes other filtering on INT column too. To my knowledge, I have two options 

Alternatively, if you always look for a specific value in the column in question, you can make use of the Computed columns, something like... Test Table 

I have a sql agent job setup for taking full backup every night. Last night the job failed with the following error message. Sql Server Error Log Message 

I have setup from ServerA to ServerB = = = = . I have used a Domain Account for Snapshot Agent and Log Reader Agent, called . The initial snapshot is initialised successfully, from there its all down hill. Error Log: 

I have changed the password to 'abc' according to this link: $URL$ I have done exactly what is written here, even using localhost, not localhost:8080 in the things to type. There was a warning at one point, but it does not tell me what. It was at the point (I am version 5.7.9): 

EDIT: After looking at the info I tried (where abc is my temporary password and mystuff is my database just below root): 

I thought User should be or something like that. ORIGINAL QUESTION: When I try to log into my phpMyAdmin on localhost:8080 I continually get: 

The result counts row (7, 25, 5, 1970-01-01 00:00:01) eight times, and adds to that (8, 25, 2, 2016-04-23 12:00:00) once. So it is giving me an answer of 9 when the answer should just be 1. 

Surely this is possible? It does not like it but does really say why. It says: 'You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'FROM (SELECT TestNumber, UserSlot ...' 

When to failover is decided by the Witness server not but the Primary or Secondary servers in a mirroring session. The Secondary Server will come online if the Witness Server cannot see the Primary Server. The Secondary server only gets transactions from the Primary server and nothing else. If the Primary Server stops sending Transactions the secondary server will just simply sit there in restoring mode and do nothing, But if Primary servers becomes invisible for Witness Server thats when the failover happens and the Witness server will make Secondary server to come online. Actually this the whole purpose of having a Witness server(Auto-Failover). If the secondary server could make these decisions on it own we would not need a witness server at all :) . 

SQL Server cluster is a fault tolerance solution it has nothing to do with performance. If you want your load on sql server to be shared , you should be looking at Replication or maybe log shipping, direct reporting calls to that replicated /log shipped server and keep application calls to the main server. If your data gets too large that no matter what you do, performance is still a problem, consider archiving data to a data warehouse, in your application database (OLTP database) only keep recent records (last 6 months). Anything older than 6 months gets shipped to your data warehouse (OLAP database). The moral of the story is clustering your server isn’t going to give you any performance boost, consider an alternative option. 

How do I UPDATE Rank in the table within this SQL statement? What do I do in the ????? ORDER BY statement to make sure it orders by Score1 first then when these are equal it orders by Score2 second? 

The more I learn about about the great things you can do with mysql, the more I keep pushing to learn. I have two tables: Tests 

EDIT: Since posting this I have read some more and some people suggest changing within this file, but I do not seem to have this setting. Is this what is causing this problem? 

EDIT: I have made an edit below, adding more info. Do I have something missing in my file? (And also can someone tell me how to get details of the warning I am encountering below?) EDIT: Also note when I add to wampmanager -> MySQL -> my.ini, I can log in, but do nothing thereafter. (Note: if I go to any other page thereafter it goes to the login screen again where it fails as below.) However, on the right in I have the following: 

FTS is language specific; it can help you to find stuff in SQL Server which is specific to a language rather than treating it just like any other string in the databases. is a base 10 number, I don’t think FTS will be of much help here. I think you’re only option is to use the operator. To learn more about why your query is running slow with like operator read article by Brent Ozar. 

After doing a lot more investigation this is what I have found. It fixed the issue (significant performance gain and WRITELOG has an average wait time of 0.0126 which was initially 14.681) Apparently the issue was with the Number of Virtual Log files in my physical log file. There is a job scheduled to rebuild indexes every night, the job creates 36GB of logs, and until few weeks ago someone had add a job to shrink log file on weekly basis. Log file was being shrunk to 500MB. Since it is a very busy server the log file would grow in size and it was set to auto grow by 3 percent. Each time it grew it added more and more VLFs. As a result my 35.5GB log file had 1600 VLFs. To resolve the issue I did the following: 

However, a single row did change. So when I try to log in again it still says when I put in the user id and password . Something has obviously gone wrong, but what? In it has the following (after the password change to abc): 

What I need to do is count the number of tests a user is signed into and are not complete. It must include all Tests they have not resigned from. (This is easy). BUT it must also include all the Tests they have resigned from and another User has not taken their place. (This is the tricky bit). Another user will have been deemed to have taken the place of the User in question if they have an entry in TestUsers with the same TestNumber and the same UserSlot (note both), and they either have not resigned themselves (ResignedTimestamp='1970-01-01 00:00:01') or they have resigned but their ResignedTimestamp is later. Here is my SQL. 

After doing the research on web mostly posts suggest I do not have enough space on the disks, I have checked the space on my disks I have have atleast 30 plus GB of free space on almost every drive, (disk for .mdf and disk for .ldf files). I have almost 15 gb of free space on my C drive. as One of the posts on web suggested not having enough space on C drive can also cause issues. Has someelse ever faced the same issue, how you fixed it? what can be the reason for this error and how I can avoid it in the future. Any suggetions pointers in the right direction are most welcome. Thank you. 

Hi guys I have question about how two different Hard disk setups can possibly affect performance of my database. I have two Options. Option 1: One Physical Harddisk and then Multiple Virtual hard drives for SQL Server's Database files (.mdf , .ndf),Log files, TempDB, Backups etc Option 2: One Physical Harddisk and then One huge Virtual hard drive for SQL Server's Database files (.mdf , .ndf),Log files, TempDB, Backups etc
