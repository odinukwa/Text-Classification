OK, let's say that you have an interstellar human population. You've got people who live on different planets in various systems, but you also have people living in space stations in different systems. Now, given such a society, the ultimate weapon would be a long-range kinetic impactor: something that accelerates a reasonably-sized mass to a substantial percentage of the speed of light, so that it can hit planets and take them out. Eventually. The obvious problem with such a weapon is that there's basically no "aiming" mechanism possible which is accurate enough across interstellar distances. Even if you knew the locations of all celestial bodies in the target system when you left and could predict their locations by the time the projectile arrives, you still cannot guarantee that you can aim with sufficient accuracy to hit the target location. No problem; you just install a guidance system in the projectile. It should have some kind of camera that can see stuff, and it should have some minimal reaction mass so that it can perform course corrections based on what it sees. Which brings me to the question. If you've got a projectile going 0.99c (relative to the target system), would relativistic effects make it difficult to perform the course-corrections needed to strike the target planet (assume it's Earth-sized)? 

Oh, that's easy. Every simulation has bugs in it. For example, it is possible for a machine using an actual SNES pad to reprogram Super Mario World to become Pong. Or even transform it into a Mario level editor. How do they pull that off? Because the simulation is imperfect. And the makers of those robots figured out how to use those imperfections to basically start overwriting memory with new code. From the outside world, we see the simulation as what it appears to be: a fat man running and jumping around. But it's all just numbers and memory in reality. For a machine with free will living in such a simulation, who can think and act faster and more precisely than any human, it's only a matter of time before they start finding the holes in that imperfect simulation. Exactly how those holes manifest themselves, we can't say. It could crash the simulation, killing them all. One of them could become Neo, gifted with the power to hack the world and seemingly defy "known physics". Or whatever. An AI within the system could only be able to manipulate the system's code directly via some sort of glitch that allowed it to start directly manipulating executable code. The main problem such an AI would have is that most simulations are not very fault-tolerant with regard to having arbitrary data fed into their executable memory, so the first time an AI encounters this glitch, the whole thing crashes. But if the AIs/simulation can survive such things, then yes, they will eventually work out the meta-physics of their reality. 

While watching a Walking Dead commercial I saw a vast number of zombies walking in a single uniform march in one direction. I wondered why (not knowing the show) and could only presume they heard a sound and therefore were all walking toward said sound. However, this was a large army of zombies, surely the ones in the way back didn't hear the same sound, so perhaps they just heard the moans and footsteps of the zombies in front of them and were following their movements. This idea got me excited, I wondered if it were possible to create a story where all zombies, given enough time, could come together to the same location by following the loudest sound possible. After a certain number come together surely the sound of (a million?) moaning zombies would be the loudest thing around. Like cosmic debris in orbit fusing together after being pulled toward one another's gravity, I want the zombies to pile up in an ever growing mass, where at the end of the story a single (or close as possible) nuclear strike could wipe them out. Question: The only presumptions I want to make about the zombies is that they live forever aside from brain being damaged and that they move toward the loudest sound they hear. What other presumptions about my zombies would I have to make to get as many of them as possible to the same place? i.e. should they hear a sound and walk forever in that direction or should they stop in the general area they think they heard it. I would think walking forever would be best to get the zombies out of remote locations, but I also want them to clump together which walking forever might impair. Is it feasible to presume they could all end up in the same location given enough time or is it just too improbable that certain zombies would ever find the "main clump". Obviously they couldn't cross the ocean so is 6 continental clumps the best I could hope for? 

What percent of the speed of light you go is not really a function of how "advanced" you are. So long as you have reaction mass for thrust (or whatever your particular method of acceleration is), you can get arbitrarily close to the speed of light. Obviously, you need some minimum tech level to be able to fly in space and navigate over long-distances at all. The limit on how fast you go is therefore based primarily on your particular engine design, any external motive systems, and how much reaction mass you carry, all of which is relative to the overall mass of the ship you're using. But these elements of technology don't map to the practical speed of a ship. So you can't look at a ship that travels 75% of the speed of light and judge anything about the tech level of the people who made it based solely on that. Maybe they had a stationary magnetic accelerator in their launch system and are relying on high-impulse propulsion to slow them down. That's not particularly higher of technology that someone who uses low-impulse propulsion over a long duration to achieve the same speed. 

This is really coming closer to the biggest unasked part of your question: can a random 30-year-old actually function as King without being deposed or conquered? I highly doubt it. Imagine running a business. Can most 30-year-olds actually keep a business functioning? Drumming up new customers, keeping old ones, getting things done on time, dealing with competition and government regulations, etc? Lots of small businesses fail, after all. Now, how many such people could run Apple, without cratering the company within 10 years. The thing about running a kingdom is that you have to run it. And the fact is, most people wouldn't have the first damn clue what to do with a kingdom. 

In an effort to reduce the murder rate I want to greatly increase the chances of getting caught. To do so I invented a device that will record your last words (and potential the murderer's and your surroundings) that could provide key insights into your death. This device would be a small chip inserted into the body. The chip would have a built in microphone measuring vibrations through your body produced by sound waves. The sound waves would be recorded into internal memory, small enough to hold just a ten minute loop (constantly overwritten). The device is powered by the circulatory system. When the person who has the chip implanted dies the chip is no longer provided power and thus the last 10 minutes are not overwritten. In the event of your death the chip could be pulled and listened too to give insight into your last moments, if no foul play is suspected the recording can be given to the family as a keepsake. Is this invention technologically feasible? Can you power such a device using just the electricity produced by the body? Where in the body should it be to get the best recordings and power while being the least invasive? How big would the device be, classic CIA-eqse implant or more like a pacemaker? Finally, what kind of recordings could it get, would it only record your own voice as vibrations from your voice box would be strongest or could it pick up others talking to you? Would it sound like real voices? 

Well this answer admittedly doesn't answer the question as is because it doesn't fit many of the requirements. But I think it is a bit more realistic so could be of use for ideas. Frozen RAM bypasses all disk encryption methods Encrypting a hard drive can be a great way to ensure data stored on a computer is safe. To access this data you type in a password and it is stored in RAM so that the computer can continue to read/write to memory. This is considered safe because RAM is volatile so no one can come in and read that password out of memory. However, it has been shown that if you greatly reduce the temperature (freeze) RAM it drains its memory much much slower, thus giving an attacker time to plug the memory into their own machine and read the encryption key. So, if you want to work this into a story, you can detail a room with top secret encrypted computers. The hacker has devised a way to gain access to the room but as soon as he does an alarm will trigger locking down everything and shutting down the computer. To combat this, before entering the hacker shoots an arrow into the computer which then delivers a payload of liquid nitrogen. He then enters the room, grabs the frozen RAM and encrypted hard drive, and makes off with all the tools needed to get to the secrets. Not as flashy as remote downloading arrows like in the avengers but real life never is. 

Detection of temporal incursions. You don't need to necessarily know when and where they went to, but you have to know in the present when such an act was launched. It could be a particular energy signature or tachyons or whatever technobabble you feel like using. So long as neither side can prevent the detection of their breaching of the fabric of time, it will work. The "time" to launch your own temporal incursions before changes caused by the enemy's team would overwrite you. There are several ways to achieve this one. You could have it that changes in the timeline do not propagate instantly; it takes some "time" for time changes to reach the present. Or you could say that the temporal war departments have the ability to shield particular areas from changes in the timeline, thus preserving their ability to respond and retaliate. Or something of the sort. 

This is something a King could actually help kickstart. Kings have money, so the King could fund various people. Indeed, a lot of the scientists/alchemists/etc of that era were wealthy noblemen. Find some of these people and fund them. But the most important thing the King can do with regard to this is bring forth future knowledge. While most 30-year-olds probably aren't conversant enough with the history of science to know the best place to jump-start a scientific revolution, even a basic education can help them move certain things forward. The medical profession would probably be a good place to start. The King could start training medical professionals in germ theory (firing those who don't want to give up their leeches). The King may not know much about antibiotics, but the concept of sterilization could work wonders for relatively primitive surgeries. If these techniques are effective, then those medical professionals trained in them will likely be hired by other nobles (who else can pay for a physician?), which can help the King build up support among them. The King's ability to improve matters of science would be very contingent on how much the person knew. If he learned calculus, being able to teach the mathematicians about the Fundamental Theorem could work wonders long-term. Someone knowledgeable about the Theory of Evolution might be able to assemble a cabal of biologists to accept it and gather evidence to help sustain it. But even so, there are many scientific fields that even a trained modern scientist couldn't help with, simply because they don't know how to use the tools that would exist in that day.
