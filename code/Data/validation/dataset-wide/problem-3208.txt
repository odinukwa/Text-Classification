Not closing his right flank at Ft Donelson, which permitted Forrest's escape, and could have freed the entire garrison. Not having his men entrench at Shiloh. Events proved this a mistake; but it should be noted that entrenchment was not yet standard practice. It was still early enough in the war that Union generals thought entrenchment sapped the soldiers' morale. The last assault at Cold Harbor (June 3). Grant wrote frankly in his memoirs about his regret in ordering that assault. 

The main problem that secessionists would have faced in court is that the question had been settled over 40 years before the Civil War: secession was illegal. The only argument that supports unilateral secession, where a state just decides to leave and that's sufficient, is called "Compact Theory". The theory is that the US is not a single nation, but a "compact" between Sovereign states, somewhat like a League of Nations. Any nation can unilaterally dissolve a treaty: likewise, under Compact Theory any state could dissolve its participation in the union. Compact Theory had a long and distinguished history in American politics. Jefferson was a proponent, and at least for a while so was Madison. But Compact Theory was rejected by the US Supreme Court three times before 1820: 

No legal basis. Necessity for a bold stroke. Strong expectation they would win in any military follow-up. 

Johnston's strategy was clearly correct. He traded space for time, and whittled away at the attacking army. This was what the entire Confederacy needed to do. As to Hood's policy: the historical rule of thumb, going back centuries, was that an attacker needed to outnumber a defender 3 to 1 to be able to carry a strongly defended position. During the Civil War era, with rifles and Minie balls and trenches, the balance swung more strongly to the defender than at any time in military history. Hood's idea to attempt frontal assaults with odds of 4 to 5 is indefensible. Sherman probably would have had Atlanta anyway: but there was no need to just give it away. Johnston would have held it longer; and if he'd had to withdraw, he would have gotten out with more men. The issue of timing is crucial. Most historians credit the fall of Atlanta as an important factor in Lincoln's re-election win. If Johnston had held Atlanta for another two months, maybe the election would have gone differently. Then the Confederacy might have been able to negotiate peace terms with the new administration. Perhaps not. Inauguration wasn't until March; Lincoln would still have been Commander-in-Chief. In real life, Sherman had already burned Columbia and Grant was just a few weeks from taking Petersburg, on the date of Lincoln's second inauguration. But would the administration have been able to conduct the same war, in a lame duck situation? It is unknowable; but probably not. Lincoln had a hard time keeping his coalition in line even when he had the full weight of his office. By 1864 this was the Confederacy's only remaining hope, to stave off military disaster. Hood and Jefferson Davis squandered it. It's probably too strong to say that Davis snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, since victory was by no means certain even if Johnston had held off Sherman for longer. But he hastened the Confederacy's fall. 

The question has puzzled historians ever since. It's hard to look anywhere other than McClellan's makeup, which has led to much psychoanalysis of McClellan. He had immense administrative ability. It's not too much to say that he saved the Union, with his formation of the Army of the Potomac after Bull Run. His Peninsula Campaign came within 4 miles of Richmond. But it's also true that McClellan was strangely timid when it came time to force the issue. He wasted countless opportunities, seemingly stalled by insubstantial obstacles. He seemed to lack initiative. Plus Lee got completely into his head. It's difficult to imagine Grant stopping for a month at Yorktown, as McClellan did, rather than sweeping over it in his first couple of hours. Ultimately no one knows. McClellan remains a complicated figure. 

British military historian JFC Fuller argued that the American Civil War was largely ignored, and European military leaders failed to learn the lessons of the war. The European attitude toward the American armies was one of condescension: the armies were irregular, volunteer armies rather than professional ones. Fuller wrote that this European attitude contributed to the tragedy of the WW1 trenches. He felt that a new kind of maneuver warfare was demonstrated in Grant's Vicksburg and Overland campaigns, and Sherman's campaigns against Atlanta, Savannah and North Carolina; and that this kind of warfare should have informed the tactics of WW1. BH Liddell Hart had a similar opinion of Sherman. 

So there was no legal leg for unilateral secession. (It's interesting to note that in all 3 cases, the sitting court was majority-Southern.) If secessionists wanted to pursue a strategy of "legal" secession, it would have to be cooperative, "consensual" secession, agreed to by both parties. The only conceivable mechanism for that would probably be the formula from the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union: "such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State." No way in hell would the legislatures of EVERY state agree to it. And anyway, that process would be agonizingly slow. Measured in years. The secessionists were men of action who needed to strike while the iron was hot. As Oldcat writes, they were not interested in a court case, nor in a protracted legislative process. They needed to secede before anyone could stop them, and then make it stick by force of arms. It's also worth noting that they (or most of them) thought they were too big to lose. The Confederacy was an area about the size of Spain + Italy + France + Germany + Poland PUT TOGETHER. No one thought Federal forces could conquer and hold an area that large: British and French military observers told their governments that the North would ultimately lose the war, the only question being how long it would take them to accept reality. So the factors for the secessionists are: 

Grant did not fight a war of attrition against Lee in Virginia. Grant fought a war of maneuver against Lee, attempting again and again to pass Lee's right and get between him and Richmond. Lee repeatedly countered these maneuvers, turning each one into a bloody confrontation and repulse; but that was not Grant's chief aim. Any look at a map of the Overland Campaign will make it immediately obvious what Grant was trying to do. The Confederate force was not "qualitatively superior". There is no reasonable standard by which it was better led: there is no military standard by which Grant was not one of the very greatest commanding generals in American history, possibly the greatest. Ulysses S. Grant gets his high reputation as a general for his accomplishments. He formed the Army of the Tennessee, probably the most successful unit of the entire Civil War. He pioneered combined land-sea operations (with Admiral Andrew Foote) on the Tennessee River. He won important battles at Ft Donelson, Shiloh, and Vicksburg. Vicksburg had been considered impregnable; Grant's victory there, which opened the Mississippi River, was probably the single most decisive military result of the Civil War before Appomattox. His Vicksburg campaign is studied as one of the great pieces of maneuver warfare of all time. Grant was the architect of the grand strategy that finally ended the Confederacy. He had the Army of the Potomac keep contact with Lee in Virginia, and sent Sherman on a wide flanking maneuver, down thru Atlanta to the sea and then up behind Lee. He also worked well with his political leadership, and grasped the realities of commanding a volunteer army in a republic. He understood the impact that the election year of 1864 could have on the Union's winning the war. This grasp of high strategy, both in theater-wide military operations and in political realities, is one of the most striking differences between Grant and other generals of the era – particularly Lee, who seemed interested only in Virginia. Grant conducted the Overland Campaign, which strategically looks almost identical to the Vicksburg campaign. He displayed the same tenacity and focus as he displayed at Vicksburg. He displayed his great ingenuity and command of his logistics at Cold Harbor, with a daring and stealthy movement across an engaged front and over the James River. That movement effectively pinned Lee down in Petersburg, and ended the Army of Northern Virginia as a mobile fighting force. The subsequent siege dragged on forever, but the military outcome was no longer in doubt. (The political outcome was still up in the air until Lincoln won reelection; but in pure military terms, the outcome of the siege was inevitable.) During the Civil War Grant captured 3 entire Confederate armies: at Ft Donelson (12,000 men), Vicksburg (29,000), and Appomatox (28,000). He very nearly had a 4th army at Chattanooga. (No other Civil War general captured any armies.) This is a stunning accomplishment, difficult even to compare with other results. Against that, Grant seems to have made only 3 tactical mistakes over the entire war: 

Just 3 tactical mistakes in 4 years of extremely active campaigning seems a pretty remarkable record. It's difficult to find a standard to compare it with; but I make more frequent mistakes than that at my own work, and I don't have an enemy actively trying to thwart me. Grant had a lower casualty rate than Lee (casualties per 100 soldiers) during the Overland Campaign and over the course of the whole war , despite operating continuously on the offensive. I think Grant's casualty rate was at the low end of the range of Civil War generals, but I don't have that table in front of me. I do know that Lee had the highest casualty rate among Civil War generals. Grant's reputation is due to his accomplishments; if anything his reputation is less than his accomplishments merit. It's not clear that any Civil War force was ever "better led" than the ones led by Grant. Apart from the mistaken assumptions in the question, it's tough to know what the question is supposed to mean. Obviously a military commander can use attrition tactics, if he has the resources to sustain it and his political leadership condones it. His job is to win: his means are "whatever it takes", subject to the laws of warfare. Is the question "Should he?" That's not readily answerable. 

250k free blacks in the South is a drop in the bucket compared with the 4 million slaves. That number of free blacks is just 6% of the number of slaves; it is just one-third of the number of NEW slaves in 1860 over 1850. It is aburd to use the 6% as "representative" while ignoring the other 94%; it is a willful misrepresentation. Stampp also writes about the profitability of slavery. He says that slaveowners typically claimed that they lost money on slave children whom they fed and clothed thru childhood, and then later sold. Those slaveowners would deny that they were in the business of "farming slaves", which had negative connotations. They fed those child slaves out of the goodness of their hearts, and lost money on the deal. But Stampp reviews the sale prices for those slaves, as recorded in various contemporary publications, and concludes that raising & selling slaves was big money for those plantation owners large enough to do it. He does not go into specific numbers; but this directly contradicts Ulrich Phillips' assertion. The profitability of plantation slavery was not tied only to the production of cotton, but to "farming slaves" also. No, the idea that slavery was somehow on its way out in the antebellum USA is a complete fabrication by the Dunning school, without a shred of evidence supporting it. It's so at variance with the demonstrable facts that it has to be an outright lie, an attempt to deceive. And in fact, one respected historian views the whole Dunning school as part of the Jim Crow system. Here is Eric Foner on it: 

Groups don't typically let that much wealth/power just slip away, without a fight. By 1860 it was illegal in the South for antislavery literature (including many Northern newspapers) to be sent in the mail: Southern inspectors were opening mail. Free speech was infringed upon: it was illegal to voice antislavery opinions. By 1860 it was illegal in many Southern states to even BE a freed Negro: if you were a slave and were somehow given your freedom, you'd better get the hell out of the state FAST. Kenneth Stampp writes in The Peculiar Institution that by 1860, many Southern courts had started reviewing wills where a dying slaveowner freed his slaves, and overruling the will, ordering that the slaves be kept in slavery. It seems that in the South, a slaveowner could do anything with his slaves except free them. So the laws in the slave states were tighter by 1860 than they had ever been. The Federal situation was even worse for slaves (and freed blacks). The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 was more draconian than anything in effect back in 1820: it was quasi-legal kidnapping. The 1857 Dredd Scott decision purported to make Negros ineligible for citizenship in ANY state – this includes the 5 states where blacks had held citizenship and been able to vote during the Constitional ratification era. In other words, the 1857 Supreme Court ruling took away black citizenship in 5 states where they had held citizenship since 1789. There was a very real fear in the North that the next ruling from Roger Taney's court could make it unconstitutional to EXCLUDE slavery from any state. Lincoln stressed this in his "House Divided" speech at Springfield in 1858, quoted on the Dred Scott wikipedia page. That same page contains a reference to Southern radicals boasting that the coming decade (after the Dred Scott decision) would see slave auctions on Boston Common. (Lemmon v. New York might have supplied the Court with an opportunity.) And of course the slave states were looking to expand slavery into Mexico and Cuba. Many Southerners could foresee a paradise of slavery extending all around the Carribean basin. See here and here. This census.gov link shows the actual number of slaves growing from just under 700,000 in 1790, to just under 4 million in 1860. That does not look like an institution that is dying out. It's an average growth rate of 2.5% per year, 28% per decade. The ending of the slave trade is not even a blip on this growth chart: 293,000 more slaves in 1810 over 1800, and 347,000 more slaves a decade later. (And, of course the ending of the slave trade would not make a dent in this growth, once it was established. A few shiploads, or few dozen, is nothing compared to how many children 893,000 people can have.) The "delta" grew every decade, as you would expect with exponential growth. In 1860 there were 750,000 more slaves than there had been in 1850, the highest delta ever. At that rate, there would have been over 5 million slaves in 1870, an increase of 1.1 million over 1860. Gail Jarvis in the "encomium", or maybe the source of this is Dunning himself, presents an outrageously deceptive misinterpretation of some facts. First: 

After Vicksburg and Gettysburg, the Confederacy had little hope of an ultimate military victory over the Union army. Their best remaining hope was for a political victory. They nearly achieved it. Grant's Overland campaign was very bloody, and closely covered by journalists (who had some antipathy toward General Meade). The subsequent siege of Petersburg dragged on for close to 10 months without seeming to achieve anything. The summer of 1864 was one of the lowest ebbs for Northern political support of Lincoln and the war. Most historians say that if the election had been held in late August, Lincoln might not have won. The Democratic platform included making peace with the Confederacy; so that would have been the political victory the Confederacy needed. Then Sherman took Atlanta on Sept 3, and the North was re-invigorated. Lincoln wins reelection in a landslide. It follows that the Atlanta campaign and siege should be a good place to look for a military result that, had it gone the other way, might have given the Confederacy its political victory. There is a controversial decision in that campaign. On July 17, Jefferson Davis relieved a capable, defensive-minded general (Joe Johnston), and replaced him with a reckless one (John Bell Hood). Six weeks later Sherman was in Atlanta. Could the canny Johnston have held Atlanta for two months longer than Hill did? Maybe Sherman would have had Atlanta anyway; but could Johnson have held it thru the 1864 elections? That's where I would look, for a "last turning point."
