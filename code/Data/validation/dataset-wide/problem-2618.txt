and are not the factors that you recognize, they are the factors that you generate. You know when you have them, because you are doing them! Once you use and thought properly, the factors of and (what you called rapture and happiness -- the translations I don't find precise) will emerge. These are very easy to recognize, because you will feel joyful and at ease! ;) 

See your anger directly as somatic energy overlayed on the body-image. As you look at it directly you can transmute it from whatever it is to pure energy, or in the worst case to regular headache :) 

As for the Right View, if I had to boil it down for a twelve-years-old, I would say something like: Nothing in this life really matters, but the pain we all feel is real pain nevertheless. Nothing in this world, nothing at all, has absolute value worth fighting over or of causing pain to others. The only thing that really matters is our pain. Can we live with less pain ourselves, and help others live with less pain? That's the only thing that really matters, everything else is games. Remember this every time you make a choice, big or small. Especially if you find yourself pushed to take sides in an argument or to get engaged in a new project. How does it affect your life and especially the lives of others? Will it bring relief or will it turn someone's life into psychological hell? However it looks to you now, it will certainly feel very real to whoever has to experience it. Therefore in everything you do, in things big or small, remember: nothing really matters, except pain. Of course, this is based on the canonical definition of the Right View that says: 

Frustration is a good example of Dukkha (the painful feeling of wrongness). It is generated from mismatch between "how things are" and "how they should be". If you look carefully once you are already frustrated - you will see this mismatch right in front of your nose. Then it's up to you to let go of "how they should be" idea. If you let go, the dukkha will subside. If you keep grasping, the dukkha will keep getting generated. Sometimes the right choice is to pay with dukkha for something bigger. But most often accepting "how things are" is a wiser choice, even if it goes against our foolish heart. 

At large, there is no one absolute purpose "built in" the universe. Meaning, there is no single prize to be taken, no silver bullet to be obtained, no single problem which, when solved, would trump all other problems. 

Altogether, accepting Three Marks of Existence liberates us from Samsara and connects with Spontaneous Perfection of Unconditioned Nirvana. 

Technically, you could resolve this either way. As long as you can completely convince yourself to take a stance and forget the other alternative, you'd be fine. However in Buddhism we are advised to try and maximize the positive qualities of mind. So if one of these choices makes you more motivated and energized than the other, you will probably do better long term by going that way. Now, regarding your parents, in this case you're not violating any ethics, except their expectations of your life, which is the domain that you own 100%. Regarding goal vs desire concept, in Buddhism it is the blinding desire/craving/lust that is recognized as a danger, for obvious reasons. Yours is not like that. Also, a type of desire that we think about but never fulfill or can't fulfill, leads to suffering. Yours is like that at the moment, so the most Buddhist advice would be to either start fulfilling it or to drop it. Staying in this limbo is definitely a case of generating suffering. 

"The Four Truths of The Nobles" are a formulaic summary of Buddha's Awakening. They are easier understood in context of Three Characteristics of Existence: 

A standard beginner's practice for those who get distracted is to count your breaths. You can count them by subvocalizing, or on fingers. I counted by touching my thumb to three phalanges on each finger, and for each full hand - count one phalanges on the other hand. Another practice to establish the mind in the beginning of the session is to 1) review all body sensations, head to toe and explicitly note every discomfort, then 2) review all breathing tensions and emotional sensations and note all of the preexisting conditions, then 3) review the state of the mind and note the quality of thinking & awareness today. Once the review is complete this way, it helps to set all distractions aside. Then again, it's not like the distractions and sluggishness is one, and meditation is some perfect state separate from those. The whole point of (Buddhist) meditation is to work with your inner condition, until you learn to manage it, and in the process get some insight. So don't treat the obstacles as something unexpected, working with obstacles is the meat and bones of meditation. 

The question is basically, why is belief in literal rebirth (reincarnation) a problem. I won't address every OP point here, just make four theses: 

but... the second one does not sound like a Buddhist principle... where did you get that from? The first one (nonattachment, dispassion) is a universally valid Buddhist principle. As a rule of thumb I would stick with this one. However, according to training I received, there are two places detachment can come from: 1) from strength or 2) from weakness. 

Once the practitioner attains certain level of mastery in meditation and mindfulness, their sleep acquires a character of meditation. It's not like they don't sleep at all, but they do retain certain level of deep awareness during their sleep. Specifically, when they see a dream, they know it's a dream. They remain aware of their body lying down on the bed. They remain aware of the content of their consciousness no matter how disjointed it gets during a deep sleep. If something happens around them, they wake up easily to provide their help if needed. From my personal experience I can say this has gotten increasingly true for me over the years of practice. As far as specific methods, stopping internal dialogue and mental gossip really helps mindfulness.
