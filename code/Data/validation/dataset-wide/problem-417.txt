This is easily solved in cases of two objects (a planet and 1 moon). For all other cases there is no easy way to predict the future movements of every object. 

Roughly $1\times10^{20}$ people. Take the solar output of the sun, $4\times10^{26} \text{W}$, divide by watts per person, $1\times10^{6} \text{W}$, and factor in the solar efficiency. Check this against the volume of the solar system, $3.82\times10^{29} \text{km}^3$, to make sure that everyone has enough room, which they do. But what about the usable mass? The mass of the solar system is $1.0014$ stellar masses. A Stellar mass is roughly $2\times10^{30} \text{kg}$. Subtracting the mass of the sun ($1$ stellar mass) gives us $2.8\times10^{27} \text{kg}$ to use to support humans. Dividing this mass by the mass per person, $1\times10^{6} \text{kg}$, we can say that there is enough mass to support $2.8\times10^{21}$ people in the solar system. From this we can see that we are still constrained by energy consumption. 

Most herbal medicine isn't foodstuff for humans either. Last I checked willow bark wasn't something humans ate. Yet willow bark tea and synthetic willow bark (aspirin) are one of the most common medications humans use. Similarly foxglove extract, which is considered the start of modern therapeutics, is toxic to humans. Plants are only useful because they synthesize medicinal chemicals naturally. The purpose of any medicine is to cure not to feed. Assuming the biochemistry is roughly similar to humans and assuming an earthlike planet with earthlike plants and animal, your cat people will use similar herbal remedies to what humans have used. 

Not in a way that would bring about the industrial revolution. Steam engines depended on advances in metallurgy beyond what the Romans had. Specifically steam engines require the consistent production of steel. While the Romans could produce steel it was time intensive and of inconsistent quality. The predictable failure of steel is important when you are constructing pressure vessels to contain high pressure steam. Technically they could have produced simple steam engines like the Newcomen Atmospheric Engine that operated at a maximum of 2 psi (0.14 bar) with a speed of 12 strokes per minute. This machine was revolutionary at pumping water out of mines but is not the steam engine people think of when they thing of the industrial age. Having a need for steel of consistent quality would probably lead to improved manufacturing techniques being discovered earlier than they otherwise would be but until those techniques are developed high pressure steam engines would be beyond the reach of the Romans. 

A 100kW laser will destroy a plane. Your 14kW laser should be enough to fry a human. To put things in perspective 3kW is the high end for industrial cutting lasers. If that doesn't work just shine it in their face. 5mW is enough to blind someone instantly. 

Argon is non-toxic. As long as the oxygen content remains around 20% you can have as much argon in the air as you want. 

You're over-complicating things. Turning water to steam and condensing it elsewhere is an attempt to use a distillation setup as a source of mechanical motion. While it's entirely possible to move water this way the vast majority of the energy is going to be wasted turning every unit of water to steam and back. It's going to be much more energy efficient to have steam powered water wheels, or pumps to move the water than to rely solely on distillation. 

According to this paper, clicking the tongue and hissing are the most common sound used for human echolocation. There are also reports of people tapping hard surfaces with their canes and using that as the sound source. Assuming your spies were trained by blind people, who developed this skill out of necessity, they would probably use similar sounds. There is a small scale study where 10 sighted people were taught basic navigation skills within a few days. This study also tested the efficacy of various sounds and concluded that palatal clicks are the most effective. Just remember that the reason for moving in the dark without a light-source is to not be noticed. Making loud clicking noises and listening for the echo will announce your presence to nearby guards. 

They could wear a hat, or other head covering. Hats are a nifty invention that can protect a head from the sun, or insulate it from the cold depending on construction and configuration. There are even specialized hats that can protect the head from falling debris or small arms fire. A towel will work well enough in a pinch, which is why you should never leave home without one. 

There is no change to the laws of physics that would allow people to be able to breathe in space. Any attempt to explain such a thing through physics is going to create a bunch of plot holes that will greatly reduce the quality of your world. You're going to be better off avoiding discussing physics at all if you want to have humans to be able to breathe unprotected in outer space. The easiest way to accomplish this is to avoid the explanation all together and treat this fact as entirely unremarkable to the inhabitants of your universe. 

The age of sails would never happen. Developing ocean going vessels unneeded if you must stay within sight of land. Any economy based of fishing would collapse because most of the waters used for fishing are more than 3 miles off the coast. The only boats that would exist are coastal vessels unsuited for rough waters. Boats will need to be shallow rowed affairs to be able to maneuver around obstacles close to shore. Trade would be limited to going up and down the coast. Crossing even a modest bay would be impossible because of the encroaching fog. 

No, an artificial intelligence could not turn the target of a skee ball machine into a cannon. Since the target of a skee ball machine has no motors in it. There is no way for anything to modify the target to launch balls without physically adding a launching mechanism to it. All an AI would be able to do would be mess with the display and the score. 

If both civilizations are mutually recognizable then the only way the them to be unaware of each other is for them to not be in the same space. Perhaps they have vastly different definitions of what habitable and interesting are when selecting where to travel to. The odds are pretty high that they would become aware of each other as soon as their radio signals are picked up by the other. This is unless one race or the other has never communicated by radio, which is unlikely. To see how far our own signals have propigated check out this. 

I'd look into soft robotics. This is a branch of robotics without hard components like motors or rigid structure. Tentacle like appendages are a common project among engineers working on the technology. Most of the work being done now involves a soft latex form with multiple voids inside of it. Changing the pressure differential between voids will inflate some and contract others leading to a bending motion. 

There aren't any commonly accepted sets of phonemes for constructed languages. The cool thing about creating your own language is that the only rules you need to follow are your own. Often times people creating conlangs will take hints from existing language if they want to make a language that fits a particular purpose or mood. If you're wanting a language that is pronounceable for a particular audience then using phonemes they are already familiar with is probably best. 

Assuming you are talking about the Earth, a 10km change in altitude is negligible. This graph shows the calculated free fall acceleration at different distances from the center of the earth using 3 different density models. Note that 10km is well below the level of precision of the graph. 

The pressure differential between ends of the pipe isn't advantageous for power generation. Imagine taking a 10m pipe and sticking it vertically into a pool of water. There is now about a 1 bar pressure differential between the two ends of this pipe. Yet there is no flow of water inside the pipe to drive a turbine. The situation will be the same with your pipe in the air. 

There isn't any space in an active dam to convert to living space. Dams are designed to support an immense mass of water. They aren't hollow. Their entire purpose is to support that load. With the exception of a control room and maintenance access ways, the only parts of a dam that aren't support structure are filled with water and machinery for generating power. In your world dams are over-engineered to be wider. This doesn't get you any extra living space as is, since as a rule dams aren't hollow. If you relax the proportionality constraint and allow for living space to be built on the downstream side we can do some basic maths to determine how many people could live within. Take the difference, in volume, between your version and their real world equivalents. Then divide by the volume per resident, to determine how many people can live in a particular dam. 

There is no standard behavior for the orbits of multiple moons. You've uncovered a problem that has plagued physicists since the 1600s when Newton was beginning to describe gravitational mechanics. This problem called the 3-body problem or more generally the N-body problem. To quote Wikipedia the N-body problem is described as: 

Using moon that is eclipsed for 40 hours every month would receive roughly 1/18th (5.5%) less sunlight than a similar moon without such an eclipse. Since you have defined your planet to be earthlike we can assume that it's receiving more solar energy to compensate for this. There will be a monthly cycle to the average temperature, coldest at the end of the eclipse and slowly warming up again over the course of the month. Life would have to evolve to cope with regular drops in temperature. This is something that life in higher latitudes, and altitudes has to deal with already. 

They can't. Evolution is very good at finding local maxima of the reproductive fitness function. However to go from cat to catboy requires a transitional period where the species is less viable. A mad scientist will probably be a able to engineer cat people (or other animals) in short order given the appropriately handwaving. 

Humans have far more than five senses. There are at least 20 that we know of. If only sight, sound, smell, taste and touch are simulated there will be countless discrepancies that will be quickly obvious. Probably the easiest sense to check for a discrepancy would be proprioception, your sense of your body's own position. As you move around the virtual world your actual body wouldn't move and the discrepancy between the two would be an indicator that you were in a virtual world. Our sense of balance would be another easy one to detect discrepancies with. This is actually a problem with existing virtual reality technology where we see movement but don't sense it in our inner ear. This commonly results in feelings of nausea. 

Our (very old) ancestors did evolve flight. We call them bats birds and bugs. In all seriousness though, no. Humans cannot evolve the ability to fly while still being recognizable as human. We are far too heavy to be able to fly. We can estimate the size wing that a human would need to fly by looking at the wings that let humans fly. A hang glider is a small fabric and metal wing that humans can use to glide through the air provided they run fast enough off a hill under favorable conditions. These contraptions weigh upwards of 20kg and have a wingspan of over 9m. They only get that light when using modern materials and manufacturing techniques. Evolving something similar would have a large period of time where the offspring would be increasingly less fit, which is something that doesn't happen with evolution. 

Future-science extreme flesh-grafting is the only way that a human is going to have it's face in it's chest. Pretty much every creature with limbs has the same morphology, of a head on a neck, with limbs attached to the abdomen. The point of divergence would have to be pretty far back for such a extreme morphological change to occur. With evolution being an impossibility what's left is direct modification. If humans ever develop the ability to transplant heads, there may be a time after that when the additional technical hurdles of rerouting nerves, blood vessels and throat will allow for mounting a human's head upon their chest. 

I don't see why not. There are already snakes that mimic branches. The twig snake is just one example. Pythons and boas are already ambush hunters. All you need is for a constrictor snake to look like a branch and you are good to go. Some arguments could be made that since such a snake doesn't exist that it could be sub-optimal for a large snake to look like a branch when a more splotchy pattern will do the job well enough. I wouldn't worry about it unless you're writing a bio paper. 

A SCUBA style breathing apparatus wouldn't significantly extend your survival time in a vacuum. In fact it might make your already fatal situation worse. Without access to oxygen your timeline of usable consciousness in a vacuum is 6-9 seconds with death following soon after. Since the only thing that would be pressurized would be your respiratory system. their is a significant pressure differential between your insides and the vacuum of space that is only contained by your fleshy body. We call damage caused by such pressure differentials Barotrauma. In addition to that it's highly plausible that that same differential would be enough to blow the mouthpiece out of your mouth. 

There are two reasons why necromancy is commonly thought to be evil. Raising an army of any sort to terrorize the countryside is considered a pretty evil act. To raise the undead is to desecrate their corpse and grave. This could also include transgressions against any religious institutions involved in the burial process. Pillaging the countryside, desecration, and acts against religious institutions are considered evil in most societies. The former can be avoided by not having your necromancers commit evil acts especially any acts involving the use of undead minions. The later requires a culture where the animating of the recently deceased isn't considered a transgression against them. Some ideas for this include: 

No "Mushroom Leather" is a modern material that happens to use fungus in its construction. While the article you linked is vague on how it is created (Especially since it used the dubious phrase "chemical free tanning method") it is a reasonable assumption that it requires modern techniques to fabricate. 

You're basically talking about beefier ostrich or perhaps a giant moa, terror bird, or elephant bird. As is an ostrich meets all your criteria with the exception of being herbivores, and the ability to carry armored knights. They are omnivorous instead of herbivorous. While humans can ride ostrich the added weight of full armor would probably be too much for them to carry. It's highly likely that any flightless bird larger than an ostrich would be able to carry an armored knight as is. So what needs to be done for a Chocobo to evolve? You basically had one with the moa, and a little bit of selective breeding will get you a larger ostrich. Interestingly enough since the moa became extinct so recently that there are still preserved soft tissue samples available to researchers. There are researchers in Japan currently working on extracting DNA from these samples. There is a slim but non-zero chance that the species may be revived sometime in the near future.
