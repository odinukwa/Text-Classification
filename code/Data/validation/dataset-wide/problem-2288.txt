A full grown mountain lion will leave bigger tracks than those of any of the animals listed above but not all mountain lions are full grown. Also, tracks in snow get bigger when they melt, and so a dog track may look bigger than it really is. Bear tracks are widely different from both. 

Probably, but it likely wouldn't keep you as warm underneath unless you wrapped it all the way around, in which case you have almost duplicated a sleeping bag. Depending on the temperature it might work great, or it could be miserable and a lot of that depends on you. Just try to test it out in safe place before you go on some crazy expedition where you have to depend on it. 

You can also take a bearing parallel to a feature like a curving river and that will give you a good idea of where you could be as the other places along that feature wouldn't be parallel. 

The caller should be at least 50 yards downwind of of the hunter. The reason is that elk have a good sense where a call is coming from and won't get very close (usually around 50 yards) to that spot unless they see another elk. If the caller is right next to the hunter, the elk will usually stay just out of range. However, if the caller is back more than 50 yards, then the elk will come much closer to the hunter. 

Actually, it is done to minimize the possibility that the feathers will contact the arrow rest. Since there are different types of arrow rests, the direction pointed will depend on the type of rest. 

Once the hands have met, the you pinch the ropes together with your left thumb and slide the right hand down the braking strand. 

The warning sign of balling up is that your boots will be noticeably heavier due to the snow sticking to them. Once that happens your options include 

Note: I don't know that its possible to answer this without mentioning the things that have happened, some of which were pretty horrible. Not everyone may want to read this. TLDR: People will be a horrible out of civilization as in it, and the rarity is matched by the severity and barbarity of the incidents. For theft; 

After a lot of thought, I don't think that there are any shape configurations that would be limited to just a square or just a rectangular tarp. However, when you are sleeping under a tarp, either on the ground or in a hammock your body is in a rectangular shape. I use a 5ftx7ft tarp and if it was 7ftx7ft square tarp it would just be extra weight to carry. 

All of this to say that while semiautomatics have been used for hunting for quite a while, today's popularity is more a recent thing. 

Honestly, you should be perfectly fine to use it. If there was no mold after storing it and before cleaned it out, I wouldn't worry about it. Camelbak's official cleaning instructions say it safe to use even if you had gotten mold inside of it after following their instructions (although it still might be stained). In short, you should be fine. 

Sierra Trading Post The other thing not mentioned in any of the above is that in some situations like long snow routes where you can't unrope, an alpine harness makes it easier for females to pee because they can undue the leg straps and leave the waist buckle completed. On the other hand, they do make unisex climbing harnesses which are basically just buckles and straps as those will fit climbers of either gender. 

The basic rule of thumb is that your small, often accessed items should go into the brain of the backpack. Things like, 

This summer I did the Toiyabe Crest Trail and noticed that there are three different kinds of trail signs, 

You want to have some water in the pot/pan, as otherwise you will scorch it. It doesn't have to be too much, just enough to cover the bottom. Then you would just want to keep stirring it. 

In Wyoming, the archery season comes first to coincide with the rut, where the elk and deer are breeding. This makes it much easier for the archery hunters as it is possible to call the elk or deer in close enough to shoot, sometimes to within 10 yards. It is extremely difficult to get close enough otherwise. I don't know why archery would be after, and will have to leave that to someone else to answer. 

and so the belayer takes the climber off belay. Then the climber attempts the move and falls and plummets to the ground. Also the confusion is supposed to be because of the belayer being English/Australian, as the American way of asking to be taken off belay is to yell "OFF BELAY". This seems plausible, but are there any actual records of this happening? 

The basic idea behind triangulation is take multiple bearings with the compass to recognizable points and draw them on the map. Where they intersect is your location. 

Source Emphasis mine. This brings up my question, is there a point when tacking after which you can't turn change back right away to your original course but need to fully swing onto the new tack for a while before tacking back? 

Traffic Jams The way that game trails are created is by animals walking on them and therefore you can have a higher chance of seeing them. Small animals will get out of your way but moose or bears would be a problem. There really isn't a good way to tell that animals haven't been on a trail, since tracks can be hard to see, especially on hard packed ground. However fresh bear or moose scat would be a good sign not to go down the trail. Also while game trails make sense to animals, they tend to disappear or wander or twist and so good navigation skills are essential. At the same time, they are usually the fastest and easiest ways of getting through dense forests if there are no human trails. 

Itâ€™s decently common to use a nalgene water bottle inside of a sleeping bag to help stay warm during the night. Before you go to bed you fill the water bottle with water warmed over a stove and place it inside the sleeping bag. It is certainly possible to use boiling water but then you will want to wrap the bottle in something to avoid burning yourself. (There are at least 6 other answers on this site plus other internet places plus my experience of people using boiling water in Nalgene bottles). I doubt that any larger heated water systems for camping exist, water is just to heavy. 

CHAPTER 517 - MINING CLAIMS, MILL SITES AND TUNNEL RIGHTS The reason that they are required to be capped is that birds and reptiles and bats and other creatures may fall into the pipes, and then are not able to get out. This is also why it became legal to pull them out and set them on the ground. At least one source that I found estimates that there are 3.4 million of the pipes and they kill over a million birds annually. 

Here are some characteristics that I can give you for a good scope, selecting the individual one will be up to you 

One of the basic principles of lighting safety is that you don't want to be the highest thing around and you don't want to be under something that is the highest thing around. For example only one group has ever been struck while floating the Colorado through the Grand Canyon, but multiple people have been struck either on the rim or while sheltering under trees on the top. Given that shower heads are usually higher than people, I would not want to be standing underneath one during a thunderstorm. 

Source Most paragliding is done by taking off from hills, but kiting/ground handling can be done on a flat soccer field (I have seen it done many times). These exercises teach the skills needed while the trainee is still on the ground. As far as exercises go, there are a lot of times when the pilots hands are up high pulling down as that is how the paraglider is steered. 

Source For places to go, it looks like Disabled Sports USA has chapters all across the United States and they should be able to point you in the right direction. There is also the Water Skiers with Disabilities Association. 

Just recently, a photographer was watching some foxes hunt rabbits. One of the foxes caught a rabbit when a bald eagle swooped down grabbed the rabbit and pulled both rabbit and fox into the air. The fox let go and the eagle took the rabbit.. That brings up the question of how much weight can a bald eagle carry? 

I was reading Desert Solitare by Edward Abbey, and in it, he mentions that he was using bull snakes (bull snakes are non-venomous) during his time as a park ranger to help control the mouse population around his trailer and to keep rattlesnakes away. While I am certain that bull snakes would help keep the mice under control, is there any evidence that they keep rattlesnakes away? 

I am thinking of buying a satellite check in device. I often go alone, and would like to upgrade from the system of of always letting someone know where I am going and when to expect me back. The problem with that system is that on a multi-day trip, it may be days before someone comes looking for you, and any deviations from the planned course greatly increase the chance of being missed by searchers in an emergency. I would like something that as a minimum has the ability to send a SOS signal, what other features should I look for? 

It is much easier going down than going up, and it is easier for the people descending to stop than the ones going up. The people going up will be working much harder, and be more irritated by having to wait for someone. 

On backpacking trips, I would like to avoid dew because it means either waiting till the sun has come up and dried my stuff off or packing wet things and drying them later. My experience is that dew is less likely at higher elevations, is this true or simply a coincidence? 

The answer is members of the dog family of animals as they are the other type of animals with paws that a similar in size 

The solution to this and especially when you have multiple people in a group and so want to limit the number of holes, is to use a single hand width trench instead individual catholes. You start by making one cathole that is wider than long, and as it is used, you fill in and the dig to one one side using the diggings to cover up as needed. When you move on, you completely fill it in. It should be no wider than a normal cathole and my understanding is that this is Forest Service's preferred method for larger groups instead of everyone digging individual catholes. 

Source There has been some discussion on this answer as to whether or not this is true, especially since it is also recommended to sleep with a warm water bottle. 

You are comparing apples to oranges here. You can have a much much higher pull weight on a crossbow, simply because it is easier and you can use mechanical advantage. If you look at history, the advantages of a crossbow is that the archers didn't need to have the same amount of physical strength required to pull a long bow. For example, 

Once we know the center, the radius is simply the distance between the center and either of the points. To use that information to find our position we will need at least one more piece of information. One can use another circle with a third point and where the circles intersect is your location. 

The US Coast Guard has done a number of studies too try and predict this and it looks like survival times can are highly dependent on the person and what they are wearing when all of the other factors are the same. 

In an ideal situation where you are using a belay device in guide mode off of the anchor, I would use a z-pulley, mostly because it would be so fast to set up. Consider your position before setting it up, 

Once, I was waiting for bats to come out of a cave (I knew there were some in the cave) and they never came out that I could see. While it was after hibernation and the bats were definitely awake (up and squeaking), it was kind of cold (too cold for short sleeves) and I wondered if that might have kept the bats inside? 

Right now the irrigation ditches and ponds have lots and lots of mallard ducklings, sometimes multiple families to a single pond. The way to tell is that there will be too many ducklings for one family in a pond, and they will sort of be grouped up.
