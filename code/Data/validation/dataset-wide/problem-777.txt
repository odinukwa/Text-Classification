Since the magnification is determined by focal length of the objective/focal length of eyepiece it is difficult to have an eye-piece with the same f ratio as the objective. Assuming pupil aprature 0.25" then the ideal eye-piece aperature will be 0.25" for most effective light transmission of the eye.A generally acceptable f8 would have a focal length of (0.25x8)=2". A 2" eye piece x 100 magnification would require an objective focal length of 200",for f8 this means 200/8 which is 25" diameter.This would give comparable brilliance at that magnification. Any deviation from the ideal means loss of resolution due to lens errors of manufacture,the combination of these errors result higher arc" resolution. You will find a lower magnification more useful as the lower mag system may effect finer arc",res and additional light to eye/optical system efficiency. There are no easy answers and sadley cost raises the barriers 

I have found a good time to view the moon is before the sky is fully light,say 8am.The pupil of the eye will no be fully dilated and better eye/lens will give improved resolution(f ratio).In addition to this an improved contrast will be achieved as the atmosphere has less reflected light relative to the optical system of the telescope. A friend and I agreed more detail of the moon could be seen to the naked eye under these conditios 

The problem may be focus and or a faint image in the viewfinder, try looking at a distant object in daytime. Of course unless you are using a dslr type camera the viewfinder will not be looking through the main optics anyway so wont show anything. 

Its a nice idea, but it wouldn't work. To stay in the Earth's shadow a telescope would need to orbit the Earth in the same time the earth orbited the Sun so that it always stayed on the opposite side. For its orbit to be this long it would need to be a long way out, remember geosynchronous orbit (one orbit in 23h 56min 4sec) is at a distance of 42,164 km. For a 1 year orbit the telescope would be so far away that its would not be in orbit around the Earth but the Sun, as it would have a much larger gravitational influence. It would also be too far away to be in the Earth's shadow cone. 

A simpler approach would be to use a planetarium program to calculate the angular size of Jupiter at the date/time you want then use a bit of trig. to work out the angular size of each pixel of the camera Tan(theta) = pixel size (in mm) over effective focal length in mm (2400mm) (Sorry I don't know how to use the equation editor) Then divide one by the other and you have the diameter of Jupiter in pixels. Note: This assumes that the barlow is operating at 2x, as the barlow magnification factor is dependent on the distance of the camera sensor from the barlow's lens (and the focal length of the lens) this will probably not be accurate. So if Jupiter is 38" in diameter and your pixel size is 5.6 microns 1 pixel = about 0.48" so Jupiter will be about 79 pixels in diameter. 

Nothing can alter a cause effect succession of events even considering a third observer passing by or through the islands even on board a similar vehicle. 

Well not sure teleporting requires an answer. There is not such a physics. However assuming the impossible I do not think we really need relativity SR in a technical sense. If I teleport instantaneously myself I would appear on the star as it will be seen from earth in 5 years. As such, in the earth calendar, I disappear for 5 y and "in a way" I move in the earth future as for an earth observer it will take 5 y to see me again. But he/she will see me as I was during my absence, ie his past. As far the star is concerned, I simply materialize there. The point is that from there, I will see my last 5 y on earth as a recorded movie. The same is for a star resident watching the movie with me. He see me before leaving so I wasn't able to give to him any sensible information. Even a pre alert of my arrival wouldn't alter anything on the succession of events. This does not qualify as moving or moving information through time, especially not backwards. At the end, the fictional teleporting seems to lead to less mind blowing results than a technological difficult but in principle possible travel at a relativistic speed. There is even no room for time dilation and it seems to me that the famous twins can use teleporting and re-meet with no even (apparent) paradox. 

There is no reason why it couldn't, though the chances of it happening are small. There are hyper velocity stars that are not gravitationally bound to the Milkyway, if a planet is ripped away from its star due to a close encounter with another star or black hole it could be given enough velocity to reach a galaxies escape velocity (about 537 km/s). 

There is a example here of the process required. But basically you need observations of the track from two locations and then just perform some relatively simple trigonometric triangulation. The Nemetode network regularly does this using images from a network of cctv cameras. 

The gravitational "pull" of a black hole is not limited. In fact the gravitational force of attraction of every particle in the Universe effects every other particle in the Universe, irrespective of their distance of separation or mass. Or to be more exact every particle distorts the fabric of time/space throughout the Universe. The distortion may me small the further away from the particle you get but it is still there according to General Relativity. Quantum theory will put a of limit on things, in that the when the distortion is reduced to the Plank length it will be lost in the general background noise. 

From the way you have formulated your question, it seems to me that you are aware of the light diffusive process named Rayleigh Scattering and why it explains the various tints and colours of the sky depending on the Sun position. Other readers can refer to $URL$ We are used to our atmosphere and as such often discuss the RS merely on geometrical bases, as I shortly did just above. However, the intensity of RS does not only depends on the inverse of the fourth power of wavelength, but also on the size of the scattering particles and specifically on the square of the molecular polarisability. As such, changing the nature and composition of the atmosphere does effect the intensity of RS. An example is SO2, which tends to intensify the yellow tint of sunsets in polluted area. This should answer the first part of your questions. Let us move to the second part, specifically using the example atmosphere that came to your mind, chlorine as a green gas, i.e. molecular chlorine Cl2. In this case, the gas is not colourless. Different respect to nitrogen and oxygen, chlorine does absorb in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. It absorbs the colours opposite to green in the colours wheel, to keep things simple as possible. In an inherently coloured atmosphere the relative importance of scattering will be less or at least variable depending on parameters such as atmosphere thickness, density etc. Let me ignore RS in such a toxic atmosphere :) What is important now is that when you point your eyes up to the sky, the green colour you see is not that one whose propagation is hindered, but rather the one that can propagate (given that we are ignoring RS). In other words, the light will be always richer of green colour. To make the final answer simple let us look at the moon when the only light that hit it is that coming throughout the planet atmosphere. With Earth, the Moon is bloody as for RS has removed the blue violet part of the solar spectrum. A hypothetical change on Earth atmosphere composition will also have a minor impact, as we have seen that the polarisability of the molecules counts. About Chloro, the planet having chlorine atmosphere. During the eclipse, its moon will have a greenish tint, or likely appear green. In this case the moon is lit by sunlight depleted of the wavelengths absorbed by chlorine. To resume, the colour of the moon is always that less affected by the planet atmosphere but the mechanisms and the final result differ. When the atmosphere is intrinsically colourless, the colour of the moon is somehow "complementary or so" respect to that of the daily planet skydome. When the atmosphere absorbs, the moon and the sky dome will tend to the same colour. Note: I did assume that sunlight can pass the intrinsically coloured atmosphere. Again depending on various parameters, this is of course not given. Most likely we won't see the Moon. We shall really care of our atmosphere. 

After installation set up,the coordinates Ra and Dec are locked in to the ra of GMT(0 astronomically) and installation latitude.These are input requirements of installation. From that point,an onboard clock remembers all points from that reference. It is not a sat-nav base unit and installation would have to be repeated if repositioned in another location. 

There are many refractors/reflectors that can be obtained ready made and be more useful as the interest develops You would be wise to get the largest objective you can afford,although an interesting project kit it is minimal in aperture(ref: Galscope) 

All biological life requires an electrolyte.Water is the only none reactive solution that can carry the solute,(salts,acids,alkali,) that would cause reactive change. Water has limits in its ability to remain the solution(evaporation:thereby restricting chemical mobility,)or (crystalisation/freezing:thus causing precipitation of chemicals in the "solid state".) Biological life ceases to evolve. 

There would be a tide of approximately 28 days due to centrifuge effect,the water being free flowing,about the mid point centre of gravity of the 2 masses. Our tides are monthly but appear daily due to earth 24hr rotation.Variation in sub-marine land masses and ocean baison cross flow have sub tidal effect that can lag or lead the moon phased tide.On a water depth of 2-4km it may,as an independent body, go towards the outside of the rotational system leaving one side dry so to speak. 

I like the answer by D. H. However re-reading the question and the comment by C. W. it seems possible that yours boy got it right in a way. Indeed, the people below equator are tilted or upside down with respect to us. This still can be explained as suggested, of course we know. But the two situations are different. It comes to me to realize that a sphere and Newton law are not enough to explain why somebody in Australia is not walking on its head. So the fact that we sense up and down plays a crucial role. Unfortunately it is a mix of physiological psychological factors, I guess. You should make sure what your son in asking, in other words. I would say that gravity is at center of Earth. Being it spherical, gravity is under our feet. 

Edit. Please note that the scenario can be made fully realistic (well almost, but because of merely technological limits) by replacing 

Besides the arguments in the previous answer as well as in the comments, consider the following. 1) the rising moon is not always the same orange or red simply because this depends on the height of the sun, as it should be clear if scattering is taken into account (see point 2). This is the major reason / answer to your main question. 2) under approximation, the intensity of scattered depends inversely on the fourth power of the wavelength. This dependency is what does amplify differences between the sun light that reaches our eyes directly (or "straight but reflected" by the moon) and light that has been diffused first. An easy but correct explanation for the ten to - 4 relationship is given by Wikipedia under Rayleigh scattering. 3) Do not neglect the response of our eyes. It is not linear in terms of intensity nor sensitivity is the same at different wavelengths. Whatever you look at, in atmosphere or out of it, will look different to a spectrometer. The maximum number of photons emitted by the Sun is in the region we perceive as green,for instance. This is true both in space or after passing the atmosphere. 

The lines show as either peaks above the black body emission (for emission lines) or troughs below the black body emission (for absorption lines). Though stars more often have absorption lines and nebulae emission. 

Rings are made up of a large number of individual particles, each in elliptical orbits. We see rings as circular because we don't see and follow the individual particles just the overall swarm of particles. Their individual orbits average out and just appear are a circle. The individual orbits are constantly being changed due to collisions between particles, and gravitational influences for moons. Saturn's F ring is a good example of this. As can be seen from the images the ring is not a circle. 

It will depend on the face of the Earth that is reflecting the Sun light. It will be a mixture of blue from oceans, white from clouds / poles, brown from deserts and green from forests. As the Earth has more ocean than land it will usually be dominated by blue (ocean) and white (cloud) making a pale blue. 

The stars in any given constellation can be at vastly different distances, there is no link between the distance and the size of a constellation. The constellation boundaries are purely artificial boundaries.
