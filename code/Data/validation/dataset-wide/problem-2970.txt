'Cogito ergo sum', 'I am thinking, therefore I am' or 'I think therefore I must be' is an existence conditioned on thought. Once thought stops, you don't exist. Other than demonstrating that experience is dependent, conditional, subject to a frame of reference, the statement says no thing interesting. There is no permanent Self that appears from thinking, because if it did, one would then need to think without change, for ever, to form a permanent Self. In fact - what you? Can I ask your 5 year old self of Descartes' conundrum? Does your retired self have the same opinion as you now? If one chooses to not rely on observation because of a speculated deceiver, one must give reasonable grounds for supporting such a deceiver. Drop a ball, any ball, a million times from a certain height. Measure the time it takes to land as accurately as it needs. If the hypothesis 'there is no deceiver' is not rejected, good good. No deceiver has ever been found within experience using the scientific method. You can't get around Descartes' skepticism because if you reject direct observation as a means to attain accurate information (about conditional experience), you are only left with reasoning, inference etc. Inference is only a valid mode of gaining information subject to accurate observations of experience. If I chose to never observe apples falling down onto the earth (or were too skeptical to care), I could state - without a sound basis (don't ask the path, it's a-scientific) - that apples in fact fall upwards, and given this information, in 50 years time Earth will be Apple free. The inference is perfectly reasonable, it's the initial observation (or lack thereof) that is at fault. Direct observation offers a clue - all observed things arise dependent on conditions (mother and father for a human), subsist dependent on conditions (food), and cease dependent on conditions (old age). No thing, even a proton or a black hole has been deemed to last for ever. All things are observed to be impermanent. As such, any notion of a permanent 'thing' or Self - an object that exists, with defined characteristics, independent of observation ('I am thinking' is an observation) - is entirely alien to what is seen, heard and sensed. Now Descartes went wrong because positing a permanent deceiver goes against the observational evidence of impermanence. You have less reason to doubt observation in a world showing and acting impermanently and empty of Self, because the deceiver, a 'thing' posited outside of observable experience - a being hypothesized as permanent, a consistent net force in some direction across All (whether making left seem as right or peacefulness seem as violence) - is definitively unobservable in a relational world (the act of observation is by itself a condition of observed properties). Such a deceiver offers more ground for doubt than does relying on direct observation. (If the deceiver is picky and does not affect All unconditionally, then his choices are conditioned, and so not substantially different (not a true deceiver) from the impermanence and non-Self (anatta) that observation of experience offers) ($URL$ for a more interesting take on the ineffable!) 

God, From, Essence, is a metaphysical construct, 'meta' = 'beyond' physics, beyond evidence. Believing that there is an underlying and guiding Essentialist metaphysics to conditioned experience (physics) is to believe in something for which there is no evidence. There is no thing 'Green', we can examine and experience to understand the 'greenness' of the apple.. at the end of our Hubble Volume, the green apple appears red, infrared and beyond due to Doppler shift, so there is no concrete colour of the apple that is agreed upon from all frames of reference. Believing that metaphysics to conditioned experience is concretely non-existent (not the empty middle of neither exists nor does not exist, but an actual negation of the existence of God, as strong Atheism tends to do), is to acknowledge the invalidity of Form, Essence. But the world runs regularly - red appears red, and the colour changes frame dependently, in a mathematically predictable way. There world is completely regular, in that none of its aspects is a-mathematical (it can always be described), with an Existence of God or a non-Existence of God, you are faced with an irregular existence - again, no evidence. Change is not possible with the former because 'things' are permanently fixed. Change is not possible with the latter, because 'things' do not exist Essentially, therefore how can they exist (and change) relationally? The Atheist cannot imagine God because the construct is not relational, not causal. 

Understandably black holes evaporate, so we don't get the permanent things Democritus posited, but if indivisibility is the core feature required of an atom or quanta, both in classical thought and now, how is a black hole not one of the above? 

The greatest difficulty (beyond accepting that Copernican, Galillean, special, general relativity and relational quantum mechanics slowly lead the way to the death of metaphysics and the anatta of Nagarjuna), is to acknowledge that the circle cannot be squared for validating any concept that is, from the get go, axiomatically declared to be independent of observation/measurement. Any and all metaphysics by definition places itself beyond the root of the scientific method, that is observation/measurement. Any statement with regards to metaphysical speculation, other than that it is beyond observation and therefore beyond experiment, is a hypothesis without any suitable experiment. All one can say is that Metaphysics is empty of verifiable/falsifiable phenomena/things/concepts - empty of any 'thing', including Existence and non-Existence. Having no access to evidence and experiment, engaging in speculation one way or the other, is engaging in a-scientific speculation. 

Is the meassurement problem - that observation causes 'wave function collapse', or that a set of probabilities becomes a distinct characteristic through observation simply a case of one observation, one data point can't make a statistic? So with one observer for one quanta offers discrete properties. 

Nothing is a 'thing' like any other. A conceptual construction that relates to another - something - directly. Something doesn't have to come out of nothing on average, stochastics can create the world within nothing. 

Logical systems cannot define themselves, as Tarski and GÃ¶del demonstrated. 'X=X', the classical law of identity, is actually a 0 information law as it is a tautology. Are you embracing some notion of permanent existence? No single 'thing' has ever been observed to not decay, even protons and black holes disappear. Direct observation pushes one to accept, or at least infer, impermanence at every level. Observer dependence for accurate, though frame-dependent information leads to QM and the relational anatta that solves EPR (if we skip the preamble and head strait for $URL$ $URL$ and $URL$ Logic (and mathematics) is a tool for inference, useful as direct observation is not possible for every thing. It can model experience accurately, subject to having been built as an accurate linguistic description of the system it seeks to model. 

Two moral systems, one Absolute, one relational (casuist, if you must): A Killing = 100% wrong. B No killing > less killing > more killing. You wake up in a room tied to a seat and are given two choices: press the button and you kill 1 person, don't press the button and 100 people are killed by someone. An Absolute, objective moral system does not provide the efficient solution (you can't argue with 100%). Someone who believes A would choose to not kill 1 person, and let the 100 die. This way they are not the efficient cause. The relational moral system chooses to kill 1 person accurately. Why? Because creating Absolute, arbitrary, 100% rules (no hypothesis test can get you to 100%, so one would wonder how such certainty is arrived at, if not by observation/measurement) creates a disconnect between the rule and our relational experience. They also have no power to choose between 'killing' and 'killing'.. only a relational addendum would do that, which would make one question the need for the objective moral rule in the first place. Relational rules are not universal. The above example can be changed - kill 1 newborn or 100 terminally ill people who die tomorrow will be killed. There you go - now A gets the right(er) answer, and we need to adjust B to: B1: no loss of life years > less loss of life years > more loss of life years. And ooon, and ooon, and ooon.. An objective moral system is complete but inconsistent. A subjective moral system is consistent but incomplete. Choose your poison - I like consistency over completeness - horses for courses as they say! 

"Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it can only change forms". Given this axiom within physics, it is fair to say that the opinion that the Universe came from nothing is little more than speculation without evidence. But! If you like a read, then this is fun: $URL$ 

If all rational, logical, philosophical, scientific, and mathematical reasoning starts with the initial axiom that 'X=X' - that is a 0 information tautology - can it be said that all ensuing rational, etc statements are therefore empty of any Essential truth and only nominal? 

It is not positively making a false statement, but it reveals a mind in hiding - one knowing it has crossed an agreed upon boundary but not capable of admitting the guilt to the other person in the equation. It can be seen as bad as lying because from a psychological point of view, in not telling the truth straight away you are in the same position of avoiding responsibility of breaking an agreed upon rule by choice. I actually did the above, owned up to it the next day by my own volition and me and the missus haven't had an issue about it since, nor did we really have one when talking about it! Nor do my female friends think that with truth, the actual breaking of the rule is much of an issue. Both are 'not truth'. But silence is also 'not lying'. This is more of a 'if a mistake has been made, not learning from it is a bigger mistake' kinda thing for me. 

Science, or the scientific method, limits itself to removing unreasonable hypotheses based on meassurment and observation (direct perception). Religion (theology) usually allows truth to be discovered not just through direct perception, but through inference, testimony of the wise, scriptures, prophecy etc. (religion as the social, economic, legal, historical etc aspects of a society through time, are not related). Philosophy, or the philosophical method, is not much different to the scientific method, but it follows the laws of logic more than the laws of mathematics (which are related).. It usually states some perceived a-priori truth, whilst science is by definition a-posteriori. Though in truth, any null hypothesis at the beginning of a scientific experiment parallels the a-priori thinking of the philosophical method, whilst the actual meassurement and analysis, the a-posteriori of the scientific method... Philosophy and Science are really two sides of one method. (Philosophy provides more rigour than theology, but in the end whether Kant's categorical imperrative or Tawheed - tend to embrace the unverifiable and unfalsifiable, metaphysics (beyond physics, or beyond observation). Philosophy does tend to stray into metaphysics a lot more than science, but the latter is not bulletproof from that either (de-Broglie Bohm, Einstenian realism, string theory)) 

Philosophy must stand within the sphere of reason, which can only be bound by the empirical, which is best represented by the scientific method (no capital letters). For an a-priori theory to be complete, without any further possible doubt, it cannot deviate from the empirical. Word and evidence must agree. Evidence that 'energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it can only change forms', that the local spacetime is flat to within the margin of error, special relativity, general relativity, more recently relational quantum mechanics. Tarski's undefinability theorem. That neither Being nor Essence are observed within our empirical world, that both Being and Essence cannot even be formally expressed within our philosophical world, points to the doctorine of non-self. The 'root of all things' is found empty. 

Both espouse world views that are seen as complete by their followers. Both consider opposing views as incorrect. Both tend to impact human psychology in similar ways through creating an 'us and them' mentality. Beyond the arbitrary split as to what field the terms are individually applied to - ideology for politics and religion for faith/spirituality, is there a concrete difference between the two? For example, within social action, a 'just war' a-la Aquinas and a 'just war' a-la Bush Jr., how are the results of action of the theological and ideological principles different? 

Are there any philosophies still claiming the existence of Absolute entities? By Absolute, I mean permanent and independent of cause and effect, such as Plato's One or Forms in general. 

Can God create something He cannot move? Yes, Omnipotence allows for that. But this action requires God to give up Omnipotence (arguably a power an Omnipotent being should have access to). They are consistent until you break the laws of physics and create more from less, as the immovable mountain is. 

How do you define 'evil'? Is it a cause of negativity at every causal link, from every frame of reference? Such Divine Evil and Divine Good is not perceived on this plane - even wiping our all of life on Earth will get a cheer from a few strange humans - 'evil' that depends on a frame of reference. The problem of evil is that it assumes that the word and concept of 'evil' offers an accurate and valid interpretation of aspects of the equation when harm is evident, as well the assumption that it offers an effective deliniation for moral action. a) Killing = 100% Evil. b) no killing > less killing > more killing. 'Kill 1 person or 100 will be killed' - choosing which rule are you guaranteed the prefered outcome of less killing, as a) infers and b) states outright? The problem of evil is that the term, once defined and overlayed over a reality that depends on conditions and frames of reference, actually offers an inferior definition of 'wrong action'.. 

Essential good or evil do not present themselves within the world. Say you were woken up and given two choices, kill one person as option A or 100 will be killed as option B. No C is offered. If you consider killing Absolutely wrong - an argument for the presence of an essentially evil nature within the act - then to keep your personal mind and soul clean, you would happily allow for option B to proceed because you are not the efficient cause of the death of 100 people. That's someone else (you weren't even the starter of this sick game!). 100% Absolute rules do not want for the reasonableness of mathematics in our relational world. If you have no concept of "killing = evil" in the Absolute, but rather have a relational rule "more killing < less killing < no killing" then you would choose A and live with the opinion that given your (very local and very unlilely) frame of reference, you took the least damaging option, hence happily fitting into the relational problem that was presented to you. The presence of essential beliefs about the world are simply inefficient at the limit when superimposed onto a (fundamentally) relational world. The essential form of evil is not present in the world. Such an evil would have to wreak damage at every causal link. Otherwise some action might wipe out Europe, but if one dude wins the lottery directly because of the action, and is happy, the action is still not essential evil. The problem of evil is a human made one. It simply pops out if you create good. The Tao Te Ching is big on this point of view.
