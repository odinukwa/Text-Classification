The above are just two examples for your specific case. Depending on your individual genetics and your regeneration of certain muscles, you might not even experience those. Make sure to check your performance on all your exercises to make sure you're not overlooking anything, and adjust accordingly. 

Now, if you know the reason why you're eating too little you can work on eating enough. How much is enough? About 4000kcal, probably more. When I first heard that number, I was shocked. But as I came to accept it, I found ways to make it happen. Some tipps: 

I can't quite remember where I read this, but there was an article on how much protein is too much. In the article, there was a point put forward that went basically like this: If you eat 400g protein per day for a few weeks, but only need 200g, your body will start to use protein for energy, since the excess is not usable for other purposes. If you now stop eating that much protein and eat 200g per day instead, your body will still use some of it for energy instead of building/repairing muscle. So my question would be, if that is true. Can a short/mid term protein surplus mess with long term protein synthesis? If so, how much can it be messed up, what can I do against that once it happened and how long will it take to even out again? 

I could imagine that the muscle fibers are already developed during puberty to a certain extent, which would make this unfair for the other competitors, since males probably develop 'better' that way. Also there's the fact that the male hormone profile influences growth much better than the female profile, making all 'gains' prior to the HRT also an unfair advantage. Although, biological women can take steroids, so that's not a good reason. Please note: I do see why the sexes should compete seperately and I'm not fighting that notion right now. I'm also aware of several practical reasons for not allowing this. Please refrain from answers citing those reasons. 

Generally, it's possible to get stronger without building muscle once you reach a certain point. The problem is, to reach that point, you'd probably still build muscle and get bigger. Also, please view this answer as a theoretical rambling instead of a recommended course of action. Theoretical ramblings: First off, you don't need to gain size to gain strength. Strength depends on multiple factors of which muscle size (and therefore amount of muscle fibers) is only one. Others are intra-muscular coordination and motor unit recruitment among others. This is why even if you keep muscle size constant, your ability to lift heavy stuff can increase. It's much harder to do, obviously and progress will slow down considerably. The other problem with that approach is that your body will want to build more muscle to be able to meet the stress you put it under. This can only be prevented by not giving your body the building blocks it'd need to do that. So if you don't provide a caloric surplus your body can't possibly build anything in the long term. Short term, your body can however utilize stored body fat to a certain degree. Your body would have to decide what's more important and would, to a certain degree, build muscle from fat until you reach a point where it decides that both are equally important. From that point on, you wouldn't be able to build new muscle without a caloric surplus. However, do keep in mind that at that point you'd be considerably lean and muscular, which is probably exactly the one thing you wouldn't want. Ways to get there: The first approach would be starting from zero. You could lose muscle first, by not working out for a few months and keep a quite strict diet, which would maybe, just maybe, allow you to get stronger from there without building much muscle in the process. You'd start pretty much from the beginning, though, with no guarantee that you'd not get huge again. The second approach I can think of is dieting down without losing much strength. This will, even more than the first approach, get rid of body fat first and muscle later. It would allow you to keep your strength, to a certain degree. This is basically a normal bodybuilding diet, but you'd accept the muscle loss instead of seeking to prevent it. Conclusion: If by "looking girly" you mean soft, without much visible muscles, I fear that can't be done while keeping and/or gaining strength. If you look up some of the top CrossFit ladies, though, you'll notice they do look athletic (and are strong) without sacrificing much of their femininity, in my opionion. Depending on genetics and how HRT is laid out, it could be possible to get close to that look. It won't be easy, though, and there's no guarantee that it'll work. 

...but it's also different Since the front squat uses places the bar in a completely new position, you might want to look out for what your upper body does. 

This is a very complex matter, but let me try to wrap my head around it. Do you need simple carbs after a workout? Well, it depends. After a workout, your glycogen stores are depleted, so your body will want to refill those to work optimally. If there's no glycogen stored in your muscles, your body will have to resort to other sources of energy. Extremely simplified, one could say that you'd burn more fat as long as your glycogen stores are empty. If you want to utilize that, don't eat carbs, but mind the disadvantages. You might feel tired, be more sore than usual and not recover as fast. For optimal recovery, though, you will want to refill your glycogen stores, which is most easily done with fast acting (high-gylcemic) carbs. Refined sugar may not be the best pick, though, especially if it's only in a coffee. So how much then? I've seen it recommended to take in 30g of simple carbs post-workout to completely restore glycogen stores. Your coffee probably hasn't as much, so you'll likely only partially refill your stores with that. A big glass of chocolate milk might be enough to refill your stores completely, though, so you'll have to consider. 

Super low impact cardio: This is basically anything you can do for hours, without really getting tired. I myself like walking to work and back (2x40min) which burns ~300kcal and doesn't really impede my lifts in any way. This article goes into a bit more detail on the benefits of walking. 

So to get better at one thing, you should preferably do that exact thing. That doesn't mean that you won't benefit from similar activities, though. Generally, the more similar the activity is, the greater the carryover. Do keep in mind though, that similar activities put similar strain on similar structures, so they can actually be harmful. Now to answer your question, is writing with your weak hand similar to spin poi moves with your weak hand? As far as I understood spin poi, not really. Writing is slow and deliberate and you're holding the pen in your hand in a fixed position. This is significantly different to spin poi with its dynamic motions and frequent finger twirling, so at least mechanically there's practically no benefit I can think of. Neurologically, though, both activities may activate similar parts of your brain, which could mean that there's at least a neurological carryover. Although I doubt it, as spin poi is about coordination of both hands (even arms) at once, while writing is about coordination of the muscles in one hand. Anyway, I'm not near smart enough to answer that question, so I guess the jury's still out on that one.
