This conclusion is clearly contradictory. The argument is valid however, since it follows a valid form of reasoning (MP). If the premises were true, the conclusion would be true. Remember that validity isn't concerned with the actual truth of the premises. 

Is it possible to construct an argument which follows the above logical form, but has true premises whilst the conclusion is false? If it is possible, then Modus Ponens becomes an invalid form of argument. If it isn't possible, then Modus Ponens is a valid argument form. Take the following argument: 

Figures such as Einstein were quite interested in the Philosophy of science. In addition to this, a fair amount of Philosophers were on the side of Scientists in the face of postmodern reinterpretations, during the science wars. So far, this doesn't really suggest a vitriolic relationship between the two fields. My gut (uneducated) feeling is that the bedlam in question is a relatively recent phenomenon. Question: Is the "Science therefore Philosophy is obsolete" attitude, recent, or is there a historical backdrop which can account for said tension? Source for Hawking's claim 

There's a good entry on SEP about Pre-Socratic Philosophy,where Cosmology is also mentioned. you might want to take a look over there. 

Yes Kant was right about space and time (and no he was not wrong about knowledge) where being right about space and time and not being wrong about knowledge are epistemological claims. Critique of Pure Reason is a response to radical skepticism. It offers the comfort of legitimizing the existence of facts in regard to empirical phenomena. The price is that the these facts are always subject to the caveat that they are mediated through and limited by the natural limits of human experience. We can talk as if the results of an experiment confirm facts about space and time, but we're simply committed to a convenience. Humans can wonder What is it Like to Be a Bat, but it is an error to assume there exists some bat so Nagely as to wonder what it is like to be a human. There is no legitimate basis for a claim that bats can wonder at all. To say that "Kant was clearly wrong" is to misunderstand the problem he was tackling. For millenia, the best philosophical responses to radical skepticism required Descarte's gods and proofs thereof. After Kant, it was still about two hundred years until G.E. Moore's offered a simple god free response to radical skepticism. However, the horrible price for Moore's stance is any claim to being clever. 

With reference to Are we capable of understanding the system in which we live? , I once read an interesting book: . You can find it on Amazon or similar websites, here is the gist of it: 

is the explicandum and is the explicans. Generalisation Roughly speaking, this is a broad statement or an idea which is supposed to apply to a group of things. For example: 

Question: Could you suggest some works which critically explore the idea that belief in God is properly basic? Thanks. 

This answer isn't actually mine, it's from an article on NewPhilosopher. I will paraphrase the article but all credit should go to the author of said article. We should start by recognising the obvious, that the claim is addressed to those who satisfy the quality of "being human". For Socrates, a human being should have the ability to eclipse basic desire in order to make conscious, ethical choices. However, this is not denying that basic desire, instinct etc.. have the ability to shape our behaviour. For instance, you may think it highly unlikely that a lion would spare its prey out of concern for its nearby children. For humans, we don't always need a visible "accusing hand" in order to stop us doing something. Oftentimes, we hold a simple belief that something is "wrong" because we just feel that it is wrong. Now, let's get onto the "unexamined life" part which we will take to mean: 

If the scope of the question allows for philosophical answers then it is clearly philosophical. If it can only be answered acceptably from a scientific standpoint then it clearly isn't. To put it another way, if the questions premises preclude the possibility of Kantian subjectivity regarding knowledge of time and space, ordinary language analysis, feminist critique, etc., then it is perhaps not philosophical. If Plato and Hume and Nietzsche cannot possibly bring anything to the discussion, the question might be more physics than philosophy, so to speak. In the end, if the question is premised on the same set of assumptions about the world that one uses in the scientific investigations of physics, then as philosophers we should be on guard. One feature that distinguishes philosophy is the questioning the foundations if our world views. 

Like many philosophical concepts, one need look no further than Plato. The Delphic maxim γνῶθι σεαυτόν or "know thyself" is oft used by his protagonist, Socrates. 

The question presumes that we have epistemic access to objective causality, or at least that we believe we have such access. However, any non-skeptical theory or law of causality presumes that causes and effects exist with the price of avoiding that presumption being utter incoherence. Philosophically speaking, one must either have their cake or eat it. An argument based on causality can't serve as the rational basis for raising concerns over how anything can exist. Logically speaking, if one's cosmology already admits the supernatural - perhaps in the form of a beginningless and endless pure being that arranges all things - then requests for evidence are not asked within the spirit of scientific enquiry. Not that there's anything wrong with that, only that one must accept the the character of inputs determines the character of outputs. That is to say that deducing a contradiction means that at least one of the premises is false. For example, a contradiction derived from the original question means that "There is something which exists that was never created" is false. 

Just to highlight that there is more than one approach to knowledge, take a look at the following. I know x if and only if: 

I would like to know how material logic differs from formal logic. From the little that I'm aware of, it is apparently the case that material logic concerns itself with the truth of the content of an argument, whilst formal logic only concerns itself with the validity of an argument form. Question: I'm under the impression that material logic is very close to the concept of soundness, is material logic an outdated concept? I would appreciate any elucidations. 

Although the argument offers the general fact that people have religious experiences, it ignores the specific fact that many people never have religious experiences. Of those who do have these experiences, many already hold a prior belief in God. The Ludic fallacy? Nassim Taleb coined this term in his book The Black Swan. He defines it as basing studies of chance on the narrow world of games and dice. The gynecologists example: 

These conditions are individually necessary and jointly sufficient. However, the JTB account of knowledge can fall prey to the Gettier problem. Here is the classical formulation of the problem: 

Agree or not, the famous computer scientist's position illustrates how slippery the proposition "X has beliefs" is when we attempt to grasp and hold it. 

Meanings don't come from cosmic process in the manner of Helium. Meanings are constructed by people. is ordinarily the same as because that's what we ordinarily mean by "is ordinarily the same". Occasional experiences of philosophical confusion result from a mistake: That meanings have some existence independent of our use of them and a general consensus among us as a language community. Playing along with the confusion requires us to ignore the subtleties of the consensus: The we don't say that the 's in and are the same in ordinary circumstances. [1] Take two Wittgenstein and call me in the morning. [1] We are ordinarily very clear about the contexts in which we would say that they are, e.g. substring matching. 

Political sanction: there are no official state superstitions nor high priests of superstition. [at the one sentence level of question and answer and analysis]. 

It seems as if your support for classifying Nagel as a panthesist is to take him at his word in regard to his claims about his beliefs without exception except when it comes to his claim about his atheism. I don't see any reason to carve out this exception or to assert Nagel is using "atheist" incorrectly based on the evidence provided in the question. Therefore, no. 

The gist of it is that reality involves a multitude of complex and concomitant variables, naive statistical models are not constructed to recognise this. 

My answer It seems to me that a generalisation such as the above can be part of the explicandum but it shouldn't be part of the explicans because, ideally, it would require an explanation of its own. This is of course assuming that you want your explanation to be a good one. In this sense, a generalisation doesn't quite fit the explanation criteria. 

This is a broad picture of an approach to knowledge known as reliabilism. It is concerned with the truth-conduciveness of your belief forming method. See $URL$ for further information. 

Sorry for turning up so late to the party. The front door was locked so I had to climb through a window. Anyway, I've recently come across the following book: 

It looks like a version of the classic omnipotence paradox to me. For instance, the paradox of the stone: 

Part of what your friend is saying does have some truth to it. Just because someone believes that X is the case, it doesn't follow that X is actually the case. 

Under the previous definition of "being human", those who fall prey to the allure of answers which allow them to follow custom and set aside contemplation- are possibly living an unexamined life. An unexamined life of the above sort would be quite pleasant, where one can live a "conventional" rather than ethically examined, life. 

No. Kant just considers plain old unadulterated pure reason. He does not look at pure reason plus now with bacon. Perhaps that's because by "pure", Kant means pure and non-human reasons are experienced as phenomena. The only reason we have access to as a ding an sich is human reason. Not requiring a super natural being to keep the world in order while not falling into radical skepticism is the cornerstone of his insight. 

Sometimes it can be a case of "moving the goal posts". Other times it is "no silver bullet." It largely depends on the rhetorical context and can be nothing more than Randell Monroe's [of xkcd] "Someone is wrong on the internet": ie. no more than being argumentative. 

In practice, we would tend to have a strong logical presumption that is not identical based on one being called "a" and the other called "b" because the difference in names implies a spatial and/or temporal difference in the conditions under which each is encountered. The burden of proof falls on those claiming "Hesperus is Phosphorus." The premise that classic philosophic logic has some strong principle of identity is a bit suspect in itself. The Ship of Theseus has been an important paradox since the early days of philosophy. The real problem is that "the same" requires disambiguation if we're talking in a logical context. Thus formal languages in computing often have multiple predicates for sameness [e.g Lisp's , , and ]. Pierce's pragmatic maxim perhaps points the way. is not identical if and only if the effects of are not identical to the effects of .
