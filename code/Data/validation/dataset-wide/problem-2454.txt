The Buddha also said that things have characteristics: as stressful (dukkha), as impermanent, and as not-self. These are statements about the truth of conditioned things. They are not statements within the realm of Physics. Physics cannot make those statements. And Physics cannot talk about ethics or mindfulness or wisdom, about good or bad, about profitable and unprofitable, about the end of stress. 

And "remembering your own (past) virtuous acts" might help you to get over guilt. Also I think that viewing it as "your" guilt, accusing your self of being guilty, may be another example of dukkha associated with a sense of self. 

Well no, there is said to be a Way (depending on which Buddhist tradition, perhaps more than one way) towards liberation. I guess the resolution to the apparent paradox is the object of certainty. Perhaps the world is uncertain (e.g. if things and ideas are impermanent, and keep changing, then you find disappointment and not certainty in things and ideas). But Buddhist doctrine says that: it literally says, that "things are impermanent and disappointing". Apparently a sufficiently enlightened Buddhist will experience certainty about the doctrine, i.e.: 

Deny it exists? (naive optimism) Passive resignation and acceptance? (pessimism) Seek to justify it? (rationalization) Make some effort to end it, to overcome it? (3rd and 4th noble truths) 

The following fragment (quoted below) might be relevant to the case you're asking about e.g. when the person is terminally ill. Don't take my word for it though! Also this commentary is to do with whether the dying monk incurs a monastic penalty (not with whether it's a karmically optimal course of action). Page 85: 

1 (I'm not a neurologist myself, so no wonder I get little insight from it; I don't want to disparage neurologists' work either) 2 (I'm not sure, because I'm not a philosopher either) 3 (I say this without understanding what that school is teaching, and why) 4 (sanditthiko akaliko ehipassiko opanayiko paccattam veditabbo vinnuhi -- see also this answer) 

Although I hope I understand a lot of what you write, I don't understand everything; but I understand it more easily when you write in English (text) than when you write phrases or equations using emoticons. I don't really understand (the definitions of) individual emoticons, nor understand groups of them. And you are able to write some (in my opinion) excellent answers; in my opinion you needn't feel it's necessary to use emoticons instead of (or as well as) text. 

Here's an article (found using Google) about that, Letting-Go or Killing: Thai Buddhist Perspectives on Euthanasia which (being Thai) I presume is Theravada. It mentions several real considerations, including, 

I think that (according to Buddhism) humans, animals, ghosts, and residents of hell all belong to the same kind of category: all "sentient", all composed of the five skandhas, and all subject to suffering. Since all belong to the same continuum (i.e. samsara), I expect that they all "lose memory" and that their "suffering finishes" in much the same way. I don't consider a dog as like a bacterium, by the way: IMO a bacterium is more like a plant than an animal. I think different schools of Buddhism differ on whether plants are "sentient" and have any "consciousness". don't they just forget or loose the momory of their suffering after it is finished? Isn't that more-or-less true (or untrue) of people too? 

It's been a long time since I read Plato, so beware this answer may be based on childish misunderstandings and bad memory. As mentioned here the "shadows" which people see in the cave are a metaphor for "real" objects perceived by the senses, which are shadows of "ideal" or "spiritual" objects. So if we're in the cave and if we see for example a (real) horse, Plato wants us to understand/believe that there's such a thing as an "ideal" horse, of which the real (visible) horse is a projection. I think that this is similar to some Buddhism doctrine but actually almost the opposite. Buddhism says there's no ideal horse, in fact there's never even a real horse, instead there's just some assemblage of bones and guts and so on. I suspect that the Anatta doctrine of Buddhism might be the opposite of Platonic Idealism: Anatta would say there's no self in the world, maybe also no horseness (no horse-ideal or no soul-of-horse) in the alleged horse , etc. Buddhist "escape from the cave" might be to understand that the cave is just an analogy, an idea with little or no basis in reality. 

There are habits which are more purposeful, conventionally, and which it would be less usual to describe as an addiction: 

Wikipedia adds that "In Mahayana Buddhism, the Middle Way refers to the insight into emptiness that transcends opposite statements about existence." Wikipedia's footnote to this sentence references the Kaccayanagotta Sutta. 

The "Mahāpadāna Sutta, DN 14" isn't one of the suttas translated in the Digha Nikaya section of accesstoinsight. 

It may be that there isn't a direct, traditional answer to your modern question. I'll try to list some of the traditional answers which may indirectly answer or touch on your question: 

Veering off-topic you might also want her to be developing concentration. I asked my mum, who's a Montessori teacher, about 'concentration' in AMI Montessori schools: she said that yes it's important/central, but it (in pre-schoolers) is unforced and comes from the child's interest in the material, that the teacher's role is (to some extent) create an environment with interesting materials and without other distractions / disruptions. 

The car which has a lay-by in front of it, which it can pull into The car which is closest to the lay-by behind it (i.e. the car which has most recently passed a lay-by) into which it can reverse The car which can most easily reverse (e.g. the car which will be reversing down-hill rather than up-hill, or the smaller car) 

But don't tell yourself, "I will stop this habit when I stop having other problems." It sounds like you'd be better to stop this habit even though you still have other problems. "Accept" that those other problems may persist for a while even after you begin to learn how to live without this habit. I think that Buddhism doesn't claim to be the cessation of suffering, it claims to be "the Way towards" the cessation of suffering (third noble truth). Buddhism says that what we do habitually make a difference. For example, the Dhammapada says, 

The sight (and formatting) of this headline is shocking to see, full-screen: it turns my stomach somehow. There is nothing else in the news headlines, at the moment, it occupies every news slot: 

On this page (the work by Daw Mya Tin) is perhaps the simplest or most complete description. I copy-and-paste the whole below (but note that this web site has a similar page of description for each other verse in the Dhammapada): 

Perhaps desires for "things" are ultimately sensual ... including power, social status, physical security ... because how could you desire these things if you were unable to sense them? But some desires might not be considered unwholesome, a hindrance: wanting to improve, wanting to find liberation, etc., may be considered skillful. Thoughts like these may be quieted eventually but I'm not sure they're a hindrance (or not necessarily and unambiguously a hindrance) as such. Some desires (i.e. chanda as opposed to tanha) are seen as wholesome and even necessary. 

Women bear many sorrowful feelings all of their lives. So how can they escape those lives and be men? In my experience, men bear sorrowful feelings too. Maybe they don't show their sorrow often. I think their sorrowful feelings are often related to their relationships with women and other men. So men too may want to escape those lives. When I read the suttas, I see little difference between men and women: merely some difference in their roles in lay society (within marriage). I think the same message (of Buddhism) might be of use to men and women. Liberation may come from studying, understanding, practicing the Dharma. 

I guess that talk which is "busy making fun of Donald Trump" is the same as "talking about kings" etc. So I think that would be considered "lowly talk", for monks: and I don't see why it would be better, for lay-people. Well, being politically active might be part of a lay-person's social responsibility: but if that is your intention you might find better ways to do that than by watching or producing mockery. 

There's some question about what akalika means (because akalika is supposed to be an attribute of Dharma). Some suggest it means timeless: 

Are we supposed/expected to have some kind of control over such thoughts/ideas/images? Or are these too anatta, and neither 'self' nor 'controlled by self'? If it's true that they are not self, and not subject to control-by-self, then how are they associated with the kamma which affects rebirth? Or is it some other, different kind of "last thought" which affects rebirth? 

In addition there are things you can do as a lay-person which may lead to non-sorrow. For example the practice of ethics (sila), behaving ethically, should result in a "lack of remorse". Or "identity view" results in sorrow, for which a converse might be anatta, sunyata, dana, and so on. And it's important to have or find good friends (who, you might find if you choose to join good communal activities). Also there are things you might do to look after yourself medically, which might help your mood. For example I read an article recently where someone was describing how their doctor treated them for clinical depression: their treatment required therapy and eventually drugs, but the first thing the doctor told her was that, even if she took sick leave from her job, she should keep up her physical exercise -- in her case, running up-hill in the morning. Being depressed she didn't feel like exercising as she used to, but she found someone else to do it with, which (scheduling an appointed time to do it with someone else) helped to motivate her to do it regularly. What I'm saying is that I'm pretty sure that medical doctors recommend physical exercise as a treatment for heartache. Also you mention "normal" twice. I suppose you're thinking of some time in the past as "normal" but I'm not sure there's such a thing. Things are impermanent, people die for example, you can't afford to think of the past as normal and the present as abnormal. Changing your expectations might help too: if you expect to be happy and normal, and you're not, then you're surprised and unhappy. If you expect that desires and attachments cause sorrow then you're not so surprised and, having recognized "this is sorrow" and "this is the cause of sorrow" you may be better able to condition cessation of that sorrow. 

The Kalama sutta tells the Kalamas to "know for yourselves" which qualities are skillful and unskillful. The context and questions is intended to help them decide which path to follow, help them to decide that "lack of greed, following the four precepts, lack of aversion, lack of delusion" are skillful qualities (and perhaps a "path" to follow); but (unlike this answer you referenced) it doesn't tell them to follow their own path. However -- 

When I wrote this answer I was not assuming that a "physicist" is a "physicalist" or a "materialist" (see comments below this answer): if that is your assumption, then this isn't a good answer for you. 

... it was that which sparked this dhamma talk. You might be right that "giving" is meant to help cultivate metta (towards others), and equanimity (towards "losing" or spending "your own wealth"). There's quite a striking picture (a modern painting by an Indian/Hindu artist), illustrating the Wikipedia article on Dana. I'll leave it to you to guess her feeling! Anyway I don't think that the Buddha is denying that Dana and Metta may be connected. Perhaps it isn't right to assume they're automatically connected; I think the lesson is that someone might spend a ton of money without much goodwill (or give it "inattentively, disrespectfully, not with one's own hand"); and that good will and so on are paramount (and more important than how much is given, and how many people of what worthiness are fed with what quality of food). 

"I am feel sad now: that's not surprising because things are well known to be unsatisfactory" "If I feel sad that is because I am craving something" "If I stop my ignorant craving then I will stop feeling sad" 

What is/are the original or canonical source[s] of this story? Some suttas like the Maha-Saccaka Sutta (MN 36) are an account of that period of this life, but without mentioning the vow. 

There are texts which describe "sloth-torpor" -- it is is one of the Five hindrances (Wikipedia), or for example The Five Mental Hindrances and Their Conquest lists some dozens of ways to overcome it. It's also counted among the ten or six "perfections" ('pāramitā' or 'pāramī') so people will mention it if they talk about the several/various perfections. It's also associated with 'Right Effort' (so it may be understood in context of the Noble Eightfold Path). 

And, if the body can be found, do we identify with it? No: because I think we're warned that identifying with things, e.g. identifying with the aggregates, or holding to a view-of-self, is a cause of suffering. 

I think these (two) end-games correspond to abandoning "afflictive obscurations" and "knowledge obscurations", e.g. as introduced in this answer to the question "What is Nirvana (mahayana)?" 

I can't answer but (in case you don't already know this, and in case it helps you to research further if you want to) there are some forms of Buddhist visualization meditation, from different schools, including kasiṇa and mandalas. Another example of a harmless (perhaps even recommended) form of "visualization" might be the wheel of life. Apparently the pictorial representation of it isn't used in Theravada (I don't know why). I think it's an example of a picture being worth a thousand words (i.e. learning the picture and its symbolism is a way to memorize those doctrines). I think the suttas mention other forms of meditation too, which involve visualization or imagination. Devices in Meditation says, 

I think that Buddhism might describe music and so on as "conditioned" (you can only hear it in certain conditions and you are unable to listen to it permanently); and, recommend that people seek or learn (instead) an "unconditioned" enjoyment and relaxation. From that point of view, if you give someone music to help them relax, then they might find it pleasant (relaxing) albeit temporary, however maybe it doesn't for example help to make them a better person. It might depend on the subject, too, for example books which spread Dhamma might be seen as more beneficial than books which don't. And as Robin's answer said it might depend on the artist's intent.
