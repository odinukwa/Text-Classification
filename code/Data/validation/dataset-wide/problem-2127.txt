It's sad, but many employers simply don't want to be "given a chance to make it right". Other than any negotiation when you first join, they want to dictate the terms and then they want you to take it or leave it. Most employer do not want your conditions of employment to be a conversation or a negotiation, and by sticking this change on you without consultation they've acted precisely in order to avoid it becoming one. This is a strong indicator that your employer holds to that approach. Only if your employer genuinely doesn't realise that you care, and wrongly thinks it was an insignificant change for you, is raising the issue likely to result in them hustling to make it right. If they knew in advance they were making it wrong, then most likely they're already braced for impact. If your employer is expecting dissent, then literally the only meaningful way for you to express that you're unhappy with the change is to leave (at least, I assume you aren't unionized or you'd mention it: if you were then collective bargaining provides alternative strategies). You can explain to your boss, or anyone else you like, that you now consider the job+conditions+benefits is less good than the job+conditions+benefits used to be. But it won't signify anything because it's the only job they're offering. If you feel that for some reason your employer is open to negotiating over whether you leave or not, they you could go to them and say "I don't like this, either fix it (and here's my proposal of what I would consider a fix) or else this job is no longer a good one for me and I will leave". But not many employers want to get into this with employees, so unless you know something we don't, the likelihood is that they'll respond, "that's fine, leave". Apart from any other concerns, once they negotiate with you they'll have to negotiate with everyone. And if they're going to tell you to leave if you can't accept the change, many employers believe that they might well sack you on the spot. So your basic situation (and this is your employer's choice to make it your situation, by doing this without consulting you), is that there's no point bringing it up until you have a new job offer in hand. And once you have a new job offer in hand there's usually no point bringing it up because you're almost always better off just taking the new job than asking them to beat your new offer. Still, if you're confident that you can get another job, and you don't mind risking a period of unemployment while you look for it, there might be no real harm in giving them a chance. Tell your boss that you're having difficulty with the new arrangements, explain that some extra days vacation or remote-working (or whatever it takes) would solve your difficulty, and see where the conversation goes. Best case they pleasantly surprise you, either by seeing that they've made a mistake or by seeing that you're serious and acting to keep you. Worst case they escort you from the building. 

Have you understood the policy correctly? Do they definitely require you to supply the device, or do they just require you to purchase the device, but they'll reimburse your expenses provided you agree that the laptop belongs to them? Do they make exceptions for people who don't already own a suitable device, or who just aren't excited by BYOD and would prefer not to participate? This is potentially quite a lot of money that they expect you to drop merely on equipping yourself to start work. But the same can be said of someone who has to buy suits when they start in a job that requires it, or has to buy a car for a particular job. Perhaps they're used to working with contractors (who far more commonly provide their own equipment)? If it's that they'd rather spend your money than their own then I would be extremely concerned: you don't want to work for an employer whose focus is not on enabling you to do good work, but rather is on finding ways to get you to pay for business-critical pieces of kit. If you already have a laptop you potentially would use for this, then is it really suitable to work on? Does it meet the specifications you think you need for the job, or that they say you need for the job? If it's a high gaming spec then it might be irritatingly large/heavy/hot for work with too low a battery life, but if it's a lightweight home machine then "not enough RAM" or "not enough cores" are common problems when trying to use cheap consumer machines for development. Is your home machine even running the OS you need for work? Will you need to upgrade to Windows 10, or hold off upgrading when you'd prefer to do so? Will you need to virtualize Windows in order start using your device for work? Can you accurately assess how much of the spec that layer will eat up, or will it be a trial and error kind of thing, where you end up buying a new device for work after a week or a month? These thing all become your concern, because it's your money you'll have to throw at any problems that arise. What rights do they expect to have to "your" device? Will they be happy for you to let your friends and family use a device that has their confidential data on it? Do they have compliance obligations, or will they gain them in future, that mean actually it's not possible for you to freely use "your" device any more? Will they require domain control or other access, and if so does that make using your laptop a non-starter? Supposing you quit or they fire you without notice, it seems unlikely they'll let you walk out of the door with it on the day. Remember Cary in "The Good Wife" with his personal laptop locked in his suddenly-former-office? That could be you. Whose time is going to be spent maintaining it? What IT support do they provide? Does the idea of their people fixing your personal machine make you feel happy ("I don't have to do this") or anxious ("what if they don't do it the way I like?")? Who will be responsible for time that you cannot work because it's broken down? That might seem like petty clock-watching, but if it's going to take you an hour a week extra to maintain it, then that time has to either come out of your evenings or else the exciting project you want to work on, and either way this job is 2.5% less good than you thought it was yesterday. Take this into account when comparing this job to any other interviews that you might be attending. 

Inform him that it exists, and give him access to look at it. Then it's up to him whether he does anything about it. There's a small risk he'll be insulted, thinking that you "should" have come to the software team with feature requests rather than do your own skunk-works. But on the whole I'd say there's unlikely to be a problem provided that what you've done isn't considered wrong by your organisation (in which case the problem is you did it, and him finding out is merely when the problem bites you back!) I'm a developer (probably not quite as veteran as he is), and personally I'd be slightly annoyed if someone forked the company's code to add features that we'd have added ourselves if asked. A fork to do something that would never be prioritized/resourced for us to do is just the way things go. From my point of view it's the same as not using the tool at all: I'd like to know why my thing isn't getting the job done for you, and whether the software department could work better so that you didn't need to do a fork, but I won't be insulted that you did it. I would also be, not insulted, but greatly annoyed in the case where someone does a skunk-works fork, shares it with a bunch of other people who build their working processes to rely on it, and then leaves the company or otherwise dumps into the lap of the software team code that the team didn't write and never would have agreed to write in the form it's in, but now has to support and maintain because it's become business-critical. The software team writes code in a way that means they're happy to maintain it in future: you've done things differently. It doesn't sound like you have built a tower of critical process on top of your code, but don't try to highlight how useful your version of the code is to other people or you will terrify him. Be aware that by re-styling it, and also because of the length of time it has been forked, you might have made it very difficult for him to take any changes back. Since it wasn't your goal to contribute code back, this isn't a fault on your part, but it is what it is. If you had set out to contribute to the original then you would have done things differently, and so you should be prepared for him to say, "nice ideas but unfortunately I can't use this" or even "Thanks, but I'm not interested in looking at what you've done". If you don't demand anything from him then you're much less likely to come across as disrespectful. Don't say stuff like "I changed the style because my style is more readable than yours" (not that I think you were planning to), because that is basically trolling him. Oh yes, and brace yourself for the fact that once he sees it he might have suggestions or find flaws, so you're going to have to be willing to listen to his opinion of it ;-) 

Now, at this point the colleague might offer a third option, "do nothing and don't snitch on me". In that case, you cannot avoid offending him and must do as your conscience dictates regardless of the unpleasantness associated with that. But if he takes the first option, let him do his own damage-limitation with your boss and then ask your boss some time later what the outcome was so far as it affects you. This serves two purposes: you want to know your level of access to the machine, and it keeps your colleague honest if for whatever reason he'd prefer to say he'll approach your boss and then actually not do so. If he takes the second option (because he feels there's no damage to him in you going to your boss), you can go to your boss and not worry about the consequences. If you're correct, that he's uninterested in security, careless, and completely secure his position, then I think it most likely he'll take the second option. If he wants to cover himself he might well take the first. You may also wish to take up with your boss the issue of why anyone is using the root password at all, in preference to properly managing the list of sudoers. But that's a separate task. It's one of the causes of this problem, but acknowledging it doesn't clean up the mess. 

I'd probably argue that the same would be true when trying to "stay sharp", except that as I've already said the concept doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me so I'm not certain quite what will achieve it! 

You currently work for company A, correct? Then it is very unethical to reveal to company B information given to you by company A as part of its day-to-day business, including (you might say especially) regarding hiring or other HR matters. The fact that you have a job offer in hand from company B is completely irrelevant, it would be a failure of your duty to company A. This is the kind of behaviour that leads to companies escorting employees directly off the premises when they hand in their notice -- they've been burned by or heard stories of people doing things while working out their notice that they would never otherwise contemplate. It may be that company B expects you to reveal to it any information you have about its employees that it would find interesting: especially once you have started work at company B. In particular, going for interviews might be seen as important information since it suggests that employee is planning to leave, and this is something the employer wants to take into account. Personally I think it would be pretty shady to extend this to the level of expecting you to share information from your old employer. Hiring someone doesn't give you the right to all their inside information. Nevertheless, if company B is pretty shady (in my view) and you want to work for them anyway, then you'd have to take their expectations into account. If company B is not shady, and the thing you're worried about happens, then you say, "I received confidential information at company A and of course I could not pass it on to you". If you say that and company B holds it against you, well, you have a problem with your employer. I think a closer call (and one that I don't know the answer to), is this: assuming the member of your new team doesn't get the job at company A and is still there when you start work, do you mention to them that you know they applied for the job, in order to ask them whether they're unsatisfied at company B and what would change that? In favour of it, you're honest and open in what you know about your team member. Against it, it might be seen by the employee as applying more pressure or suspicion than you want, and you might have to put on record for company B what you've discussed.
