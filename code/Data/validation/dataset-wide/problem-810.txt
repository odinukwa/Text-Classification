When inflation occurs the stretching of the gravitational field is dependent on the perturbations within that field originally. These perturbations are caused by quantum fluctuations. This leads to fluctuations in the magnitude of the inflation itself at a given point in space, causing gravitational waves due to the gravitational potential between neighboring points. The waves are fed by the inflationary energy, but are seeded by these quantum fluctuations. This site gives a good explanation, as well as this particular quote: 

Carter & Winn (2010) suggest that the most promising means of detecting exoplanet obliquity would be through miniscule signatures imprinted on the transit light signal at ingress and egress (~ 200 parts per million for a planet as oblate as Saturn). Zhu et al. (2014) use this technique to make the first tentative detection of exoplanet obliquity from a Kepler object, the 18 Jupiter mass brown dwarf Kepler 39b (KOI-423.01). They measure an oblateness of 0.22Â±0.11. They also place some upper constraints on the oblateness of other planets in the Kepler catalogue. 

One property of distant objects, that follows from the limited speed of light, is that we are observing them in the past; the light that they emit takes time to reach us. For very distant objects, we are effectively observing the universe at a very early time. Objects that are very far away, such as distant galaxies, are receding away from us, which causes the light that they emit to be doppler shifted. The recession velocity is proportional to the distance away, and in turn so is the magnitude of the redshift. This redshift allows us to put a number to the distance away; combining this with the speed of light limit allows us to determine how old the light we are observing from them is. These two effects, the limited speed of light and redshift, effectively allow us to determine an evolutionary timeline for the universe, and place constraints on when certain objects appear. 

NASA recently discovered 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid that appears to have a very elongated shape, unseen in solar system asteroids. 

Non-periodic comets are comets which have very long orbital periods (>200 years or more), spending most of their time in the outer solar system. Planet X, recently revived by researchers at Caltech, is a proposed planet orbiting in the farthest reaches of the outer solar system. The Caltech researchers infer its presence from to its effect on the orbits of Kuiper belt objects. If such a planet exists, and is the cause of the Kuiper belt object alignments, could it not also knock such objects in to the inner solar system, creating non-periodic comets with huge aphelion orbital distances? Could our current observations of non-periodic comets be used to infer properties of the planet? 

There's a pretty comprehensive wikipedia page on the subject. In summary.... Throughout the 2000's conflicting results were published using the same data. The conflict seems to center on the selection effects of the surveys, and the corrections applied to account for them. I did a quick search for 'redshift quantisation' on the Arxiv and found no papers since 2009, which suggests the supporting data has been comprehensibly discredited, or explained away by natural mechanisms. There are two explanations for the quantization that do not require exotic cosmologies. The first is the large scale clustering of galaxies that traces the cosmic web. The walls and filaments formed in this web leads to groupings of galaxies around specific redshifts along the line of sight. The second explanation is the quantisation of emission from Hydrogen, known as the Lyman series. Since photons can only be released with certain energies, the measured redshifts are also quantised (this is only true in low pressure and temperature environments, otherwise pressure and thermal broadening occur). 

This is an area of active research. The current Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm predicts bottom-up formation of halos, whereby smaller halos coalesce in to the larger halos we observe indirectly today through X-ray measurements of clusters. This suggests that small dark matter halos wouldn't survive to the present day. There has been research in to the possibility of mini haloes surviving, but interactions with dense baryonic structures, such as stars, as well as streaming by an irregular galactic potential tend to wipe out any small overdensities in the distribution. However, if such mini haloes did exist in the early universe they could have contributed to the collapse of primordial gas to form Population III stars. Simulations have been carried out to investigate such a model, with Population III stellar masses comparable to those expected $(\sim100 M\odot)$. 

Dark Flow has been thrown around as a term a lot lately, especially with the latest Planck results. New Scientist reported last year that it was now statistically improbable, but the paper by Atrio Barandela mentioned in the article places doubt on the statistical significance of the dipole measurement by the Planck team. I'd like to know what observational limits lie on it's existence as a physical phenomena (giant attractor/multiverse/new region of spacetime/other weirdness) and not just a statistical anomaly in the overall matter distribution, I.e. what future observations could prove or disprove this theory? 

Transit signal for KOI-423.01 over 12 orbits. The residuals of two models, one with oblateness and one without, are plotted at bottom. The Oblateness model is a better fit to the data. Oblateness variations are thought to be conducive to exoplanet habitability by regulating temperature modulations, so I expect that measurements of this property over time will be a priority in future exoplanet observations for astrobiology and SETI studies. 

Sending anything to Mars is expensive. Sending a machine capable of drilling to the required depths to find subsurface water would be prohibitively expensive with current rocket payload limits. There are also far more accessible sources of water on the surface - lakes of ice in craters, water rich minerals, and even an equatorial frozen sea . There is also water at the surface of Mars on the poles, but the conditions here are much harsher than nearer the equator, and there is less sunlight, reducing the capability of any solar powered rover. The subsurface water is not necessarily that far below the surface, but it is also not a torrent; more likely trapped as ice particles in between the rock or in secondary minerals. 

There are a number of flaws with your idea (despite the relativity breaking transatlantic journey times that would be possible). Inflation is a popular theoretical model put forward to solve three main issues with the Big Bang cosmology: the horizon problem, the flatness problem & the magnetic monopole problem (see the wiki for details). It consists of a scalar field called the inflaton, a physical field that pervades all space. During inflation it undergoes a phase transition to a lower energy state, releasing huge amounts of energy that drive the expansion. To force the field back to a higher energy state would require inconceivable amounts of energy, and have to be applied across the entire universe. Not only is this impossible, but also annoyingly prevents its use for local galactic travel. 

If a single solar mass black hole did form through some exotic process it would grow through absorbtion of the CMB. 

The Kaggle galaxy zoo challenge is an example of a problem begging for ideas from outside the field. Sander Dieleman, with a background in deep learning and feature learning, bravely stepped forward, creating an image classifier utilising convolutional neural networks; his full solution is described fluently here. These kinds of techniques could be applied to any image classification problem in Astronomy, or similar techniques could be used to classify other astrophysical objects from survey or signal data. I would steer clear of doing your own image capture, as there are plenty of openly available data sets with greater depth, resolution and coverage than you could hope to carry out yourself within a reasonable time frame. 

With regard to collisions with earth, or inner planet collisions in general, you're right that Jupiter has both a positive and negative effect on asteroid and comet trajectories. On balance though, the effect is mainly positive. From earthsky.org: 

In most cases clusters of galaxies are moving away from each other. The gravitational attraction between galaxies is usually enough in concentrated clusters to overcome the cosmological expansion. The Milky Way and Andromeda, both the largest galaxies in the local group, the cluster of which we are a part of, are close and massive enough to overcome this expansion. Therefore we will never lose sight of the stars in the Andromeda galaxy until the stars within it die and/or fade out, in approximately 10 billion years. However, if you are talking about individual stars, not the collective starlight of stars in a given galaxy, then the answer is we still cant! 

This book by Andrew Liddle is fantastic for explaining the basic concepts and giving the reader a good mental picture of the ideas, but it may be a little more basic than what you're looking for (I still keep it as a good reference when reading more advanced texts). If you're looking for something more advanced Peter Coles & Francesco Lucchins guide may be of interest. Unfortunately some of the discussions have already dated a little (there is a large section on non-gaussianity if I remember rightly, whose proponents have been all but silenced by the latest Planck results). This is another good resource I went to when completing my graduate cosmology course, but I couldn't recommend it on it's own; many of the derivations are piecemeal at best, so ideally read in conjunction with a more thorough text. Not sure if you came across this text during your undergrad investigations but it is basically the bible of galactic physics along with this. It goes in to some of the touch points of galaxy physics and cosmology which may prove useful for your understanding. Finally this may be of interest - I can't vouch for it but it popped up when looking for links to the books above, has good reviews and seems to be at the level you're looking for as well as discussing some topics you may already have exposure to. For all the above I'd recommend getting them out from a library first and working thoroughly through a few chapters to get a feel for the text before splashing out. 

Either or neither. It's impossible to tell from the present. If runaway climate change occurs, then yes, the conditions on Venus could be a potential analogue for the kind of environment on Earth due to the greenhouse effect. Mars's atmosphere is assumed to have been much thicker in the past, otherwise it could not have sustained liquid water on the surface; it would have evaporated away. This water is required to explain the gorges and riverbeds we see on the Martian surface today. Researchers are still unsure where the atmosphere went, but the prime candidate is through top-loss to outer space, rather than sequestration through minerals on the surface (see here). The likelihood of such an atmospheric escape process becoming dominant on Earth is small due to the Earth's greater mass and strong relative magnetic field, which prevents ion escape. In fact, the dominant loss process on the earth is sequestration. Some estimates put the reservoirs of sequestered carbon from original CO$_2$ at 250000 times the size of the existing atmosphere. The alternative is that the Earth remains in its current steady state, or close to it, far in to the future. There are many mechanisms to enable such an equilibirum, such as oceanic sequestration of C0$_2$ highlighted above. There are also more contested theories such as the Gaia hypothesis. This proposes that the global biological ecosystem on the Earth is self regulating, helping to maintain life enabling conditions on the Earth. It's pretty much a dead-cert that life doesn't exist on either the Martian or Venusian surfaces, so we can accept that if the Gaia hypoethesis is true, the Earth will never reach these conditions.
