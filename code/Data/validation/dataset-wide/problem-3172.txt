I have found this text about Soviet elections turnout on the site of the Moscow State University. I do not know who is the author. Some points: 

I think the answer is demography. In European urban and agricultural societies the main limiting factor was the extent of available land. While Europeans had high fertility rate at the time, most children could not reach their puberty due to food shortages. At the same time, the nomad peoples could just divide and find new pastures. And the territory of the Asian steppes is enormous. In most cases where Mongols were faced with numerically equal enemy, they retreated. There are very little cases where Mongols successfully defeated their enemies with equal number of troops. And in most battles even when they were victorious, they suffered greater losses. As to the question why Europeans did not expand to the steppes in the East, this is simple: there was nothing to grab in the steppes. No treasures, no cities, no profit. And the land was poor for settled agriculture. On the other side, Europeans took considerable and repeated efforts to expand to the Middle East because that region had things to take.

Equality can be different: equality before law, equality before God, economic equality, racial/physiological equality, sexual equality etc etc etc. Neither Judaism nor Christianity nor traditional classical religion provided for universal equality. Judaism 

In fact, it is a reference to a book by German feminists Helke Sander and Barbara Johr "Befreier und Befreite: Krieg, Vergewaltigung, Kinder". The Beevor's reference hints that the estimates are by the hospitals and only quoted by Johr abnd Sander, which is untrue. The reference is thus a forgery. In their book Sander and Johr define rape as any kind of sex with a person in power, including sex for food, prostitution, sex for getting job etc. This definition of rape is certainly not mainstream and does not reflect any country's criminal code. But Beevor does not warn the reader about the fact that Johr and Sander use a very specific definition of "rape". The book includes an estimate of the rapes victims based on data from Berlin's clinic Kaiserin Auguste Victoria. From 01.09.1945 to 31.12.1946 this clinic registered 9 cases of rape by Russians (according the words of the women, as the clinic did not verify the validity of the claims): 

To see how ridiculous these numbers of "killed" are, lets consider the "deportations to Gulag". According the report to Khrushchev of 01.02.1954 (you can see the full text at the site of N.Yakolev's foundation, a very anti-Stalinist and anti-Soviet institution). 

This is another answer of mine based on the statistics released by the Levada Center, a leading Russian social study organization. They conducted polls on the popularity of Lenin and the USSR since the 1990s. Do you regret the breakup of the USSR? Yes-No-Not know. In March 1992 66% regretted the breakup the USSR which is thrice those who supported it. The number never fell much below 50%. 

Was possession of weapons prohibited, encouraged, allowed to members of some organizations, or what? 

I think such example are either extremely rare or inexistent. The scientific knowledge is usually not lost, at worst, some theories get banned in favor of other, less accurate, such as Heliocentric system. Even if some knowledge was lost, we cannot know about it because lost means there was no trace left in the records. That said I think one of the examples of rediscovered knowledge was knowledge about the American lands first visited by the Vikings. But this is not a strict example because the vikings did not make their knowledge a scientific discovery and because the knowledge was not strictly lost: their sagas still were there though little known. On the other hand, the engineering, applied knowledge can be quite easily lost. Some examples are building the aqueducts and the Greek fire recipe. 

As to the ghettos, they were not implemented in 1938 yet, but when they were they were seen as a means of national self-determination for the Jews. Initially the ghettos were just Jewish districts where Jews enjoyed a high level of autonomy and self-government, up to law enforcement. This level of Jewish autonomy was not seen in Europe ever. This was quite in line with various projects for national self-determination in the USSR, say the recently-created Jewish Autonomous Oblast in the Far East in the USSR. Note that the ghettos were officially called "Jewish districts", which was not seen as suspicious by many because Germans instituted similar ethnic districts for other people as well in many occupied areas, including the "German districts". Only later the ghettos were sealed under various pretexts, mostly being claims of epidemics or need to protect the Jews from the non-Jewish population. One should note that the Germans used similar approach to non-Jewish ethnic groups as well, take for example the ghetto-like Russian autonomy (or reservation) centered in Lokot (so-called "Lokot Republic"), which is viewed now by some Russian neo-Nazis as an example of on ideal national state, as well as an autonomous community of Old Believers near Polotsk known as "Zuyev's republic" after its leader. 

The first emperor to take the monarchical title was Heraclius. After defeating the Persian Empire in 627 he took the title "King of Kings" which prevuously belonged to Persian king Khosrau II. As such, starting from 629 he ordered to style him Basileos Basileion "King of kings" or simply "Basileos" "king". This continued with all consecutive emperors. Besides taking the royal title he also changed the state language to Greek from Latin. Note that in Latin documents the title was borrowed from Greek rather than translated as "rex". Emperor certainly was not monarch before Heraclius, in modern terms it was "dictatorship". Also note that the predecessor of Heraclius, Phocas was desposed by the senate, which indicates that at least senators did not consider the state to be monarchy. Romans called their state "republic" even at the time of the Roman rexes. And the term "republica orbis" continued to be used for the whole Christian world in the Middle Ages. 

Maybe there could be other explanation. Who knows what was the official Chinese position in reality? 

No, they weren't. Even concentration camp inmates who were incarcerated temporarily were required to sign a paper that they would never tell anybody about what they saw in the camp. This information was secret for many reasons. Not only to hide the Holocaust, but to hide other abuses as well (of non-Jewish prisoners), to hide information on who were the prisoners (there could be important figures inside), on the ethnic composition of prisoners, on the jobs the prisoners were occupied with (this was war secret), on the medical experiments performed and so on. 

It is incorrect to perceive that there was a single concept of slavery in ancient world. The Latin word for slave, "servus" at the same time meant a servant. The concept of slavery differed very much between ancient societies and also differed in time. Sometimes a slave would be considered a member of the family to the extent that a formal kinly relationship such as formal adoption would be required for having a slave while in other societies the concept of slavery rose from the captured enemies or even possibly, rebels. Still in others one could become a slave for failing to pay a debt and could earn freedom back upon paying the sum or serving a certain term. The societies differed much in the social status of "slaves" and their rights and the very word for slave could only barely be translated from one language to another without loosing a part of the meaning. We currently apply the same term "slave" to penal farm convicts, prisoners of war, debtors forced to work to repay debts, dependent peasants, minor clan members and so on, who all had different legal status. The situation is quite similar to how we apply the term "king" to various ancient titles that had little in common (rex, basilios, vanax, archon, archagestes, despotes, hegemon, tyrannos etc). There was little in common between elected and not heriditary Roman rex responsive to the senate and a Egyptian pharaon yet we call the both "kings". If a Roman of the time appeared in modern day he would possibly call the president "rex" and the penal farm prisoners "public slaves". 

Use of slanderous language Beevor does little to restrain himself in wording and language, sometimes attempting to attribute hate speech to unnamed witnesses. In many cases he makes collective accusations against Red Army soldiers:
