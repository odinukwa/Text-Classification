As others have noted, your "ceteris paribus" is not very well defined. If you only want to redistribute "here and now" all the profits to the workers, then you can use the "Kaldor fact" that the wage share is usually around 60-70% of GDP and thus profit share around 30-40%. This means that profit represents something like 40-60% of wages, if this is the figure you are looking for ? You can of course find a more accurate figure concerning the country or sector you are interested in the national accounts. I understand that you exclude price increase if you are interested in the real wage at the aggregate level (and probably in a closed economy). Like Tobias, I think that the really interesting question is : what would be the short run, medium run and long run effects of such a "policy" ? In the short run it could maybe boost GDP through higher consumption demand. But sooner or later it seems unavoidable that you would meet insufficient investment (no one would invest to get zero profit back) and thus insufficient capital, except if you raise taxes and socialize investment. Maybe you should have a look at the economic history of Yugoslavia, where workers were supposed to control the firms. 

"Is there anything I could read to find out what different methodologies each school of thought uses, where exactly do they differ and how scientifically valid are their theories ?" About Marx : 

I think the best way to answer you is to build a simple model. That's usually what economists do to answer such questions. I hope it will be useful. Assume there is only one good in the economy, the 'consumption good', that people are all of the same generation or the same age and that one lives only for two periods (youth, and old age). Then the answer to your question depends on the durability of this consumption good. How long can it remain useful to consumption after being produced ? Or, to think as an economist, is it expensive to keep the good useful ? If it can for no cost remain useful for more than one period, then it can be rational for all workers to save simultaneously half of the monetary wage they receive as a compensation for their labor in period 1. Then at the end of period 1 firms will sell only half of the output produced by the workers. They will store the rest of it (we have assumed that this storage does not cost much). Then this stock of the consumption good will be available in period 2 and will be sold to the workers, who will buy it with their monetary savings. So the story is exactly the same as it would have been without money, if workers would have stored directly the commodities they produced. If the consumption good is not durable, or is expensive to store, then this scheme is not possible. In reality, of course, many commodities of first necessity are not durable (goods but also services), and many durable goods are expensive to store. But that's not so much of a problem because we live in a world where generations do overlap, so the young produce for the old. When there is a demographic disequilibrium inside an aging country, then it should be able to trade with a 'younger' country, provided it has accumulated enough 'savings', i.e. valuable durable assets. Edit. So far I only answered the question : is it possible for every one to live without working at the same time ? But the number of active workers can decrease with time if savings are used to invest in capital goods which make labor more productive. 

have variation in within-individual time paths across individuals (i.e. individual heterogeneity, must be varying at $it$ not just homogeneous across $i$ within $t$.) 

To be clear, when we say a unit fixed effect in econometrics, we are referencing any time invariant observed or unobserved determinant of the dependent variable. It's easy to show that all of these are "wiped out" by the individual level demeaning. The individual level demeaning also controls for the average differences in observed and unobserved independent variables across individuals. Individual fixed effects in the model mean that any source of bias must be time varying. Thus, if someone argues that your variable is endogenous on account of some variable that is constant in your sample, you have already controlled for that by only using variation over time to identify your point estimate. So with the inclusion of these individual fixed effects you can focus on determining time varying covariates that determine your independent variable. Time fixed effects will strip away any changes in variables that are the same for all individuals in a given period of time. For instance, if "individuals" are grouped together in the same state or municipality, and there are some changes in state or municipal policies for all individuals in that year,then the time fixed effects could strip away these effects without a need for measuring them. This only leaves concern over variables that have different time paths within different individuals. So with both time and panel fixed effects, to identify the effect of your variable of interest, exogeneity concerns aside, that variable of interest must 

Different consumer preferences will lead to different properties of the consumer's willingness to trade one good for another. For instance, suppose that consumers preferences are linear in the consumption of either good: $U=\beta_x x + \beta_y y$ where $\beta_x$,$\beta_y$ are positive constants The marginal utility of $x$ would be $\beta_x$ and the marginal utility of $y$ would be $\beta_y$, and the MRS would be $\frac{\beta_x}{\beta_y}$, also a constant. This tells us the consumer would be willing to trade between $x$ and $y$ at a constant rate. An alternative would be consumption of each good entering utility in a multiplicative fashion (Cobb Douglas), for instance $U=xy$. The marginal utility of $x$ would be $y$ and the marginal utility of $y$ would be $x$ and so the MRS would be $\frac{y}{x}$, which indeed would depend on consumption. In this example, the MRS decreases as consumption of $x$ rises. As the consumer enjoys more $x$ he is willing to give up less and less $y$ for another unit of $x$. So it's not entirely trivial whether the MRS depends on consumption, whether it does or not depends on how you model consumer's preferences. 

Now, you should understand the strategy economically before solving it analytically. When Firm 1 has the first-mover advantage, it can (and will) dominate all of the market by producing more and not leaving a space for the Firm 2, which enters after Firm 1. So, Firm 2 has two options: (a) Don't adjust and sell nothing and make zero profits or (b) Try to threaten Firm 1 against dominating all of the market and possibly make some positive profit. Obviously, it chooses (b). What the strategy (in the question) says is basically the following: If you deviate from Cournot equilibrium, I will produce a lot more and make production so high, that the prices will drop to zero and both of us won't make any profits. Now, we need to see whether this threat is credible or not. Before we proceed, please remember the following shortcut: Non-credible threats usually are Nash equilibria, and never are Subgame-Perfect equilibria. 2.a. Show that producing less than Cournot is worse than producing exactly Cournot: Remember, that $q_1 = q_2 = q_c$ is already a Nash equilibrium. Now, let Firm 1 deviate from the equilibrium and produce less: $ \pi_1 = (a-b( \frac{a-c}{3b} + \frac{a-c}{3b} - \epsilon) - c) \cdot (\frac{a-c}{3b} - \epsilon = \frac{(a-c)^2}{9b} - b\epsilon^2 < \pi_{cournot} $, So, it will not make any sense for Firm 1 to produce less. 2.b. Show that producing more than Cournot is worse than Cournot, because Firm 2 will respond with higher quantity: $\pi_1 = (a-b(\frac{a-c}{3b} + \epsilon + \frac{a-c}{3b} + \delta) - c)(\frac{a-c}{3b} + \epsilon) = (\frac{a-c}{3} - b\epsilon - b\delta)(\frac{a-c}{3b} + \epsilon) = \frac{(a-c)^2}{9b} - b \epsilon^2 - \frac{a-c}{3b} b \delta - b\delta\epsilon< \frac{(a-c)^2}{9b} = \pi_{cournot}$ So, we conclude that the following strategy profile: { $q_1 = \frac{a-c}{3b}$; $ q_2(q_1) = \begin{cases} q_c, & q_1 = q_c \\ q_c+\epsilon, \forall\epsilon>0&q_1\neq q_c \end{cases} \} $ is a Nash equilibrium. That is, a non-credible threat by a Firm 2, which threatened to bankrupt both firms if Firm 1 din't play by the rules, worked and forced Firm 1 to play by Cournot rules, even though it had a first-mover advantage. The answer to part (A) is YES. Now, we have to check, whether this strategy profile is Subgame-Perfect. (Recall, that we are not asked to solve for all subgame-perfect equilibria, just check the existing). 

The problem is to distinguish between changes along the production function, from $f(K_1, L_1)$ to $f(K_2, L_2)$, and changes of the production function, from $f(K_1, L_1)$ to $g(K_1, L_1)$. A very simple example/model. Imagine that the only input is labor and that this input doubles between t and t+1, but output more than doubles : $L_{t+1} = 2 L_t$, $Y_{t+1} > 2 Y_t$. To interpret this observation you have two alternatives : 

During the 'Cambridge controversies on capital', this was one the arguments which led the English Keynesians to reject the notion of production function. One famous paper building a growth model without a production function is Kaldor-Mirrles (1962), A New Model of economic growth 

I was talking with friends about soil exhaustion in agriculture. They tell me that it is very frequent because of the methods employed in modern agriculture. They suggest that this amount of exhaustion is 'unsustainable'. What strikes me in contrast with other environmental issues is that there seems to be no externality here : each farmer degrades his own land. So what should we think : a) These are long-term effects, so that it is a problem of intergenerational equity. b) Farmers do not know about the effects of these methods, or are not rational. c) There is no problem : soil exhaustion is the rational outcome of intertemporal planning and is due to time preference of farmers and consumers. Any references on the subject are welcome. Thanks, U. 

The steady-state value $k^*$ must be a fixed point : $(1+g)(1+n)k^* = s(k^*)^{\alpha} +(1 - \delta) k^*$ Taking the difference between this equation and the dynamic one : $(1+g)(1+n)(k_{t+1} - k^*) = s((k_{t+1})^{\alpha} - (k^*)^{\alpha}) +(1 - \delta) (k_t - k^*)$ Now if you denote by $d_t = k_t - k^*$ the distance to steady-state, this gives : $(1+g)(1+n)d_{t+1} = s((k_{t+1})^{\alpha} - (k^*)^{\alpha}) +(1 - \delta) d_t$ But : $(k_{t+1})^{\alpha} = (k^* + d_{t+1})^\alpha = (k^*)^\alpha + \alpha d_{t+1} (k^*)^{\alpha - 1} + o (d_{t+1})$ (Here was the Taylor development.) So that finally, this equality holds approximately around steady state ($d_t$ small): $(1+g)(1+n)d_{t+1} = \alpha s (k^*)^{\alpha - 1} d_{t+1} +(1 - \delta) d_t$ From the steady state condition you can also compute (assuming that $ng << n+g$): $(k^*)^{\alpha -1} = \frac{n+g+\delta}{s}$ 

So we are indeed "controlling for" those time invariant unobserved confounding factors, as well as average differences in observed factors across individuals with panel fixed effects. We are indeed "controlling for" covariates that have common variation across individuals within a given year with time fixed effects. Let $y_{it}=\beta_i+\lambda_t+X_{it}\beta+\epsilon_{it}$ be the specification with $i=1\dots N$ and $t=1\dots T$. Initially you do the panel demeaning, which creates the transformed variable $\overset{..}{y}=(y_{it}-\overline{y_i})=\underbrace{(\lambda_t-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)}_\text{panel demeaned time dummies}+\text{other demeaned terms unrelated to year FE}$. This removes the $\beta_i$, along with any other time invariant confounding factors. Then you demean with year FE, doing the transformation $\overset{...}{y}=\overset{..}{y_i}-\overline{y_t}$ where $\overline{y_t}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}y_{jt}$. $=\underbrace{(\lambda_t-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\lambda_t-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)}_\text{want to show this = 0}+\text{other demeaned terms unrelated to year FE}$ . . since $\lambda_t$ is common to all $i$ in a given year, $\sum_{i=1}^{N} \lambda_t=N\lambda_t$ and similarly for $\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j=N \frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j$ . . $=(\lambda_t-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)-\frac{1}{N}(N \lambda_t -N \frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)+\text{other demeaned terms unrelated to year FE}$ . . distribute the $\frac{1}{N}$ . . $=\underbrace{(\lambda_t-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)-(\lambda_t-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)}_\text{=0}+\text{other demeaned terms unrelated to year FE}$ $=\text{other demeaned terms unrelated to year FE}$ 

If all you care about is looking at changes in a given currency and not relative to others, just look at how the purchasing power changes over time. By this, I mean you can pick a basket of goods and then see how much currency is required to purchase that particular basket. 

Just thinking out loud here, not saying this is correct others may have a better idea. I'm going to roll with this assumption that you are using best econometric practices so that you trust your estimates and want to take action based on them. (1) The partial effect of going from $I=0$ to $I=1$ would be $E(Y_1|I=1,N=\overline{N})-E(Y_1|I=0,N=\overline{N})$ $=\hat{\alpha_3}+\hat{\alpha_4}+\hat{\alpha_5}\overline{N}$ When irrigation is already positive, the marginal effect of irrigation on yields just be $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial I}=\hat{\alpha_3}+2\hat{\alpha_4}I+\hat{\alpha_5}N$ (2) So you are curious what level of Nitrogen makes it so that the marginal effect of nitrogen is the same as the partial effect of irrigation? I think you could get at this by finding the $I^*$ and $N^*$ such that $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial I}=\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial N}$? We've already found $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial I}$ above, so we need to calculate $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial N}$ $=\hat{\alpha_1}+2\hat{\alpha_2}N+\hat{\alpha_5}I$ From here $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial I}|_{N=N^*,I=I^*}=\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial N}|_{N=N^*, I=I^*}$ $\hat{\alpha_3}+2\hat{\alpha_4}I^*+\hat{\alpha_5}N^*=\hat{\alpha_1}+2\hat{\alpha_2}N^*+\hat{\alpha_5}I^*$ $\rightarrow (\hat{\alpha_5}-2\hat{\alpha_2})N^*=(\hat{\alpha_1}-\hat{\alpha_3})+(\hat{\alpha_5}-+2\hat{\alpha_4})I^*$ $\rightarrow N^*=\frac{(\hat{\alpha_1}-\hat{\alpha_3})+(\hat{\alpha_5}-+2\hat{\alpha_4})I^*}{(\hat{\alpha_5}-2\hat{\alpha_2})}$ I bet the optimal irrigation and fertilizer decision would equate the marginal product of fertilizer per dollar spent on fertilizer with the marginal product of irrigation per dollar spent on irrigation which would be $\frac{\hat{\alpha_3}+\hat{\alpha_4}+\hat{\alpha_5}N}{P_{irrigation}}=\frac{\hat{\alpha_1}+2\hat{\alpha_2}N+\hat{\alpha_5}I}{P_{fertilizer}}$
