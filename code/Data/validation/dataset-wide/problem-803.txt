EDIT: For an easy-to-use empirical formulation you could try the relationships proposed by the Planetary Habitability Laboratory. 

All stars have some angular momentum. Conservation of angular momentum when the core of a star collapses means that it is very likely that most black holes are rapidly rotating, just as newly-born neutron stars are observed to be extremely fast-rotating. Even if one were to have a star with a non-rotating core as it collapsed, the subsequent accretion of material with angular momentum would give the black hole that angular momentum. Non-spinning black holes are a theoretical ideal that is unlikely to be found in nature. The details of the accretion of material onto a black hole are complex and still the subject of theoretical and observational research. But yes, the details of accretion in spacetime governed by the Kerr metric appropriate for rotating black holes will differ from those of a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. Kerr black holes have an "ergosphere", outside their event horizons, where material is force to co-rotate with the black hole. 

This is ground that is probably duplicated in a variety of questions here and on Physics SE, so I'll keep it brief. You have also mixed in several different questions. The Chandrasekhar mass has very little to do with determining what initial mass of object will end up as what particular type of stellar remnant (or black hole). Whether a star will end up exploding as a supernova depends primarily on its initial mass, but also whether it has a binary companions. There are (basically) two routes to supernovahood. 

The rest frame for measuring (astronomical) speeds and velocities depends on the context and purpose. A geocentric frame, based on the Earth's centre of mass might be appropriate for objects in orbit around the Earth. A heliocentric reference frame, centred on the Sun, is often used when describing the line of sight velocities of astronomical objects, but more usually, a barycentric frame at the solar system centre of mass is used. For example, this is how the radial velocities measurements of exoplanet host stars or components of eclipsing binaries would be quoted. It would also be appropriate for the motion of objects in the solar system. Motions in the Galaxy are commonly defined in two ways. One is the Local Standard of Rest (LSR), which measures velocities with respect to the average motion of stars near the Sun. The second attempts to measure velocities with respect to the Galactic plane and radially and tangentially in the plane with respect to the Galactic centre. These are the so-called $U,V,W$ velocities. The position and motion of the LSR with respect to the Galactic centre are uncertain at the level of a few km/s, whereas the solar motion with respect to the LSR is more precisely known. The Galactic centre can also be used as a reference frame for the motion of galaxies in our local group. e.g. when talking about the motion of the Andromeda Galaxy. Finally, we can determine a cosmic standard of rest - the co-moving stationary frame of the Hubble flow - using precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In other words, we can determine our peculiar motion with respect to the Hubble flow by observing the dipole doppler signature in the CMB. 

Your misunderstanding is in the second paragraph. If $n<n_c$ then there are insufficient collisions to excite the molecule into the upper level. Thus in equilibrium there are very few excited molecules and since the luminosity is proportional to the number of molecules in the excited level then little radiation is seen. The critical density is defined as that (temperature-dependent) density at which the rate of collisional excitation to the upper level of a molecular (or atomic, I suppose) transition, equals the rate of radiative de-excitation. The rate of de-excitation is given by $n_2\ A_{21}$, where $n_2$ is the number density of the molecular species in the excited state and $A_{21}$ is the relevant spontaneous emission coefficient. The rate of excitation is given by $\gamma_{12} n_1 n$, where $\gamma_{12}$ is the collision probability (which depends on the speed of molecules in the gas and hence temperature), $n_1$ is the number density of the molecule of interest in the lower energy state and $n$ is the number density of all molecules in the gas. There is also a rate of collisional de-excitation given by $\gamma_{21}\ n_2 n$. However there must be a relationship between $\gamma_{12}$ and $\gamma_{21}$ because for a gas in thermodynamic equilibrium, we know that $$n_2/n_1 = \exp(-E_{21}/k_BT),$$ and so if collisions are in detailed balance then $$\gamma_{21}\ n_1 \exp(-E_{21}/k_BT) n = \gamma_{12} n_1 n$$ $$ \gamma_{21} = \gamma_{12} \exp(E_{21}/k_BT)$$ OK, so now consider a gas where there are radiative losses from state 2 and allow it to come into equilibrium such that $$\frac{dn_2}{dt} = 0$$ $$ -A_{21}n_2 - \gamma_{21}n_2 n + \gamma_{12} n_1 n = 0$$ $$ \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp(-E_{21}/k_BT)\ \frac{1}{1 + A_{21}/\gamma_{21}n}$$ If now we say that $A_{21} \ll \gamma_{21}n$, then radiative de-excitation is (relatively) negligible compared with collisional de-excitation then the $n_2/n_1$ ratio approaches the level expected by the Boltzmann ratio. If on the other hand $A_{21} \gg \gamma_{21}n$, then the ratio of $n_2/n_1$ becomes much lower and radiation removes excited molecules faster than collisions create them. Now we ask how much radiation we are going to see from this gas. (1) If $A_{21} \ll \gamma_{21}n$, which we can restate as $n \gg n_c$, the "critical density". The luminosity from the molecules will be $$L \propto n_2 A_{21} \simeq n_1 A_{21} \exp(-E_{21}/k_BT)$$ If $k_BT < E_{21}$ this means that $n_1 \gg n_2$ and the luminosity per molecule in the gas has a fixed value that is independent of density $n$. There is just a fixed amount of radiative losses per molecule of the species in question. (2) If $A_{21} \gg \gamma_{21}n$, which we can restate as $n \ll n_c$, The luminosity from the molecules will be $$L \propto n_2 A_{21} \simeq n_1 A_{21} \exp(-E_{21}/k_BT) \frac{\gamma_{21} n}{A_{21}}$$ and so this is smaller than for the first case by a factor of $n/n_c$. So now there is less radiation per molecule of the interesting species because fewer of those molecules are in an excited state. NB This is a different thing to the "quenching" density for forbidden lines that I refer to in my comment. 

Now in reality, it is a bit more difficult than this because stars also have a "proper motion" across the sky due to their motion in our Galaxy relative to the Sun. This means you have to do more than two measurements to separate out this component of motion on the sky. In the case of Proxima Centauri the motion against the background stars due to proper motion is larger than the parallax. But the two components can clearly be seen and separated (see below). It is (half) the amplitude of the curved motion in the picture below that corresponds to the parallax. The proper motion is just the constant linear trend with respect to the background stars. HST images of the path of Proxima Centauri against background stars. The green curve shows the measured and predicted path of the star against the background field over the next few years. 

The density of the solar atmosphere decreases with radius. The position of the solar photosphere is defined by where the optical depth (measured inwards) reaches unity. There is no direct connection between pressure/density and gravity; only between the pressure gradient and gravity. $$\frac{dP}{dr}= -\rho g$$ A larger gravity merely increases the pressure and density gradient over what it would be in a lower gravitational field at the same density. The photosphere occurs at the density and temperature it does, because that is where the optical depth reaches unity. The species that dominates the opacity at these temperatures is the H$^{-}$ ion (hydrogen with an extra electron). The Earth's atmosphere is largely neutral and even at higher densities has a much lower opacity at visible wavelengths. 

An incomplete shortlist would be: (i) If you can measure the maximum possible mass of a neutron star (the most massive neutron star gives a lower limit to that), then it tells you how "hard" or "soft" the equation of state (the relationship between pressure, density and composition) is in the interior (especially at the core), and therefore tells you something about the matter composition and the nature of the strong nuclear force at small separations. Nuclear pasta is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on this. (ii) Measuring the masses and radii of neutrons stars would directly tell you about the equation of state at different depths inside a neutron star. Again, I think nuclear pasta does not have a major bearing on these diagnostics. (iii) Measuring the rate at which neutron stars cool, tells you about the interior composition. Quark matter and boson condensations in the core would allow for faster cooling. Abrupt changes to the cooling rate can tell you about superfluid phase transitions. Cooling can also be accelerated by nuclear pasta phases by allowing the URCA process to operate. (iv) Measuring the response of pulsars to glitches tells you about superfluidity in the interior and crust and the coupling of crust and core will depend on the properties of what is in between - i.e. nuclear pasta. 

The "iron core" in a supernova is actually the end product of a nuclear statistical equilibrium that begins when the silicon core begins to fuse with alpha particles (helium nuclei). Exothermic reactions are possible right up to Nickel-62 (which is actually the nucleus with the highest binding energy per nucleon). In fact, successive, rapid alpha captures produce nuclei with the same number of protons and neutrons, but at the same time, the competing processes of photodisintegration and radioactive decay work in the other direction. The process is thought to mostly stop at Nickel-56 which, because heavier nuclei are more stable with $n/p>1$, then undergoes a couple of $\beta^{+}$ decays via Cobalt-56 to Iron-56. However, the core of a supernova just before it explodes is likely to contain a bit of a mixture of iron-peak isotopes. Before all this happens it is possible for iron and nickel to undergo nuclear reactions if there is an appropriate source of free neutrons. The elements beyond iron in our universe are predominantly created by neutron-capture in either the r-process or the s-process. The r-process is thought to occur after a core-collapse supernova (or a type Ia supernova) has been initiated. The neutron flux is created by the neutronisation of protons by a dense, degenerate electron gas in the collapsing core. However, the s-process can occur outside the core of a massive star before it explodes. It is a secondary process because it needs iron nuclei to be present already - that is, the iron that is used for the seed nuclei is not produced inside the star, it was already present in the gas from which the star formed. The s-process in massive stars uses free neutrons produced during neon burning (so at advanced nuclear burning stages beyond helium, carbon and oxygen burning) and results in the addition of neutrons to iron nuclei. This builds up heavy isotopes, which may either be stable or undergo $\beta$ decay and/or further neutron captures to build up a chain of "s-process elements" (e.g. Sr, Y, Ba) all the way up to lead. The overall process is endothermic, but the yields and reaction rates are so small that it has no major influence on the overall energetics of the star. The newly-minted s-process elements are easily blasted into the interstellar medium shortly afterwards when the supernova explodes. 

I'm going to assume two things. (I) That we are tarking about a material/object at least in local thermodynamic equilibrium, otherwise it is difficult to give much physical meaning to the temperature. (II) That when you say "we can produce" I take that (on Astronomy SE) to mean "we can observe or deduce". The obvious winner, in the sense that we can still "observe" what happened (the outcome) is from the first fraction of a second of the universe. The electroweak transition occurred at temperatures of around $10^{15}$K and left us with the weak force, electromagnetic force, baryon masses and possibly the matter/anti-matter asymmetry. The production of helium and lithium in the universe took place at temperatures of $>10^{10}$K and we can still see the evidence. Neutrinos are produced copiously in the cores of supernovae at temperatures of $10^{11}$K. These neutrinos have been observed from Supernova 1987A. 

The gravitational redshift factor and also the factor by which time dilation occurs in a gravitational field is approximately $GM/Rc^2$. Here, $R$ would be the radius from which light was emitted and $M$ is the amount of mass within radius $R$ (making the crude assumption of spherical symmetry). Thus, for an external observer, light emitted from a radius of 10 kpc, might have $M \sim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ in the galaxy shown. The redshift/time dilation factor is only $5\times 10^{-7}$ and is basically negligible. This could perhaps gets an order of magnitude bigger as one approaches the denser central bulge, but is still very small. The only appreciable redshift and time dilation effects will come in the immediate surroundings of any supermassive black hole. By immediate, I mean within about a hundred Schwarzschild radii, where $R_s = 2GM/c^2$. In our Galaxy that would mean within a billion kilometres. 

The magnification refers to the increase in angular extent (expressed as a solid angle) of the background source, but is also the factor by which its total brightness is increased. The reason for this is that the flux received per unit solid angle is unchanged by gravitational lensing. So if the source area increases by a factor of $M$, then so does the overall brightness. This increase in total flux observed applies whether the magnified source is resolved by the telescope or not, since that is merely an instrumental issue. 

One of the fundamentals of General Relativity is that an observer travelling freely in a gravitational field cannot do any local experiment that would give different results to the same experiment performed outside a gravitational field. Orbiting a black hole falls into this category of an inertial frame if there are no external forces besides gravity. To the extent that GR is a good theory, then no, there is no "local experiment" (including how you feel) that would differ if you were travelling in a strong gravitational field. 

This is a well known, well researched phenomena. Yes, there certainly is a correlation between metallicity and the likelihood of observing a hot Jupiter. There are two classes of explanation. (1) The correlation is real and due to the fact that it is easier to form planetary embryos from metal-rich material in the core-accretion model of giant planet formation. (2) The observed exoplanets are those that weren't swallowed. The hosts are metal rich because they did swallow others. Finally, it was thought possible that there could be an observational bias. Planets are easier to find and measure around high metallicity stars. This applied mainly to the Doppler technique, because high metallicity stars have stronger spectral lines. Transit detection should be much less affected. Most think that some form of (1) is going on. (2) is argued against because the correlation still appears in stars with a wide variety of convection zone depths into which planetary material would have mixed. I'm not sure it is dead though, there have been a number of claims for abundance enhancements that look like the product of planet engulfment. I'll add some references later. Nice work though to discover the correlation if you knew nothing of it previously. 

EDIT: Here is an even more awesome picture. The lower plot shows the relative mass fraction of each element as a function of enclosed mass as you work your way out from a 15 solar mass star (it has shed 2 solar masses during its evolution). The really awesome thing is that it is animated, so it shows you the first few moments after the core-collapse and how things start to change. Note that the outer $5M_{\odot}$ of the envelope is about half H and half He by mass prior to the core collapse. Lots of He and then O in the layers below that. The upper plot show how the density temperature and outward velocity are behaving. The image is from the website of Woosley and Heger (2007), a canonical work on the subject. Hmm. I can't upload the animated gif. Here it is; well worth a look. 

The key here is that to produce gravitational waves, the supernova explosion must not have perfect spherical symmetry. Technically, what you need is an "accelerating" gravitational quadrupole moment. It is quite unlikely that supernovae explosions will be symmetric. Asymmetries can be produced by binary companions, magnetic fields, rotation... The characteristics of a "burst" source of gravitational waves will be quite unlike the signature of coalescing binary black holes. The magnitude of the signal is expected to follow the collapsing core of the star and reach a peak at something called the "core bounce", where the equation of state of the gas "stiffens" and a shock wave propagates outwards. The signal is thus likely to gradually increase in amplitude for some tens of milli-seconds, followed by an abrupt spike at the bounce, followed by a "ring-down" as the core (a proto-neutron star) settles down towards a spherically symmetric configuration over the course of a further 10 milli-seconds or so. The frequencies of the waves will have a broad range governed by the characteristic frequency implied by $(G\rho)^{1/2}$, which is the inverse of the freefall timescale, where $\rho$ is the density at the time when the GWs are emitted. For a typical core collapse, the densities could range from $10^{14}$ to a few $10^{17}$ kg/m$^3$ over the course of the event, producing GW frequencies of tens to thousands of Hz - exactly in the range at which aLIGO is sensitive. Because GWs pass through the envelope of the star unimpeded then the GW signature of a supernova probes the very heart of a supernova explosion and should be seen some hours before the visible signature is apparent. On the other hand any neutrino emission from a core collapse supernova should be detected at a very similar time to the GW waves. Any delay here could fix the currently poorly known neutrino mass.
