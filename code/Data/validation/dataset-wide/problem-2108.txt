Depending on how the manager has been mentioning that they wish to expand IT (specifically to you or to a wider audience), it could be that they are looking/waiting for someone to pick up the ball and run with it. And perhaps hinting that they'd like you to do it. Despite your perceived inexperience, this sounds like a great opportunity to make a real difference quite early in your career. Generally, opportunities such as these do not come all that often - so I suggest you grab it with both hands. Based on your description of the company culture and your own personality, it seems you merely need to present some ideas to the manager and take it from there. 

As you more or less state yourself, your options are quite limited. Since your primary concern is finalizing the visa process with zero risk, you will have to keep completely silent until it has been resolved. Join the new project, go to meetings - but do the work in a way that makes sense knowing that you will leave. Most projects start with somewhat generic tasks. If such tasks exist and you would be able to finish them, that could be the way to go. Try to avoid tasks that require you spending time which will essentially be wasted when you leave. You cannot control how the employer reacts to you giving notice - but you do have some control over your own 'legacy' at the company after you have left, by making your exit in a professional manner. 

If this problem only seems to bother you, there is probably not a lot to do. You could talk to others at work and find out if many other people find it as offensive as you. If it turns out you are not alone, you could get management involved. However, I could imagine that management would be more concerned if the offensive language was overheard by customers. If it's going on in a high-pace kitchen behind closed doors, they could perhaps just view that as 'normal'. 

It actually does happen; I have twice been contacted out of the blue having previously been unsuccessful. When employers are overwhelmed with applications, it is unlikely to happen unless they are unsatisfied with the applicants and recently remember having to reject qualified people for a similar role. At 'slower' times when employers struggle even to get applications, they have more time and therefore are more likely to browse the archives. Predicting whether a given company is likely to return sometime in the future depends on too many factors, most of which are unknowable to an outsider. So even though it does happen from time to time, it's best to assume that it will not happen - and never ever to rely on it. The phrase is basically a polite rejection where the company keeps its options open by not burning bridges. 

The employer surely gave some reasons for the rating. If you disagree with those reasons, you need to present arguments to the contrary. If they did not provide reasons, insist that they do so you can improve. Do not merely complain without presenting a case. 

At the very least, the worst case scenario has been avoided: Company A simply refuses to accept your friend - and Company B therefore lets your friend go. Surely, awkwardness is preferable to firing. One can never completely avoid awkwardness through an entire career - so one needs to deal with it. And the best (and perhaps only) way is simply consistently delivering the goods. So basically, it seems the problem is that one single person is not immediately positive towards your friend? There may be a multitude of reasons for that. The person may be introvert or the chemistry might just not be there. The bottom line is: That person is not undermining your friend's working experience; your friend is doing that by himself. Stop fixating on everything having to be perfect; it rarely is. Concentrate on aspects which your friend controls - like actual work performance. That is all one can do to affect others perception of oneself. One can never demand others embrace you whole-heartedly; one can at the very least expect they are civil, which it seems this person actually is. And finally, this is not (yet) a managerial problem - so don't make it one. It's all in your friend's head and may be resolved by himself. 

Perhaps you should consult a lawyer - but on the face of it, your position does seem very weak. I am not an Australian lawyer, but perhaps legally you haven't resigned - so they technically are firing you - and that could mean something. Regardless, your current situation seems entirely self-inflicted. If it is a genuine misunderstanding, you should attempt to clear it up immediately, as not clearing it up would probably be considered tacit acceptance of their interpretation. But even if you convince them that they have over-interpreted your statement, why should your current employer keep you? What would be the benefit to them? You have made it clear that you wish to move on, so from now on you are probably a financial liability rather than an asset. Your situation brilliantly illustrates why one never ever discloses such intentions to an employer. Only when a new job has been secured should one formally resign. There is no gray area; you should appear 100% employed at your current job until you resign. 

What do others do? It comes down to the culture at the company, which among numerous factors depends on country, business sector, company size, the age and personality of people - and other factors such as how close you are to the boss and the 'seriousness' of the conversation. Another approach could be taking the opposite view: What is the consequence of you NOT greeting the boss? Would it be considered polite and non-interrupting or weird an unapproachable? In a Danish context, I always greet when not doing so would seem weird. 

Your handling of the situation is basically correct. The fact that the client department appreciates your work should be used/exploited further by you. Tell them that you unfortunately are not getting through to the payments department, which is a shame as you enjoy working for them, but obviously need to be paid. It is always preferable when you can have the client handle company-internal problems such as this; it's much more difficult to be alone against an opaque and silent corporate entity. Monday I would tell the department you work for that you need payment by the end of the week - or you won't show up next Monday. Remember to add that you would much prefer just to get paid and continue working - but need to draw the line now. Anyone reasonable would understand - and if they really do appreciate the work, they will even fight your battle. 

If HR hasn't seen your CV through the recruiter, you are totally in the clear. Even if they had, you are perfectly within your rights to go on your own. In that situation, I would probably let the recruiter know that I had found another entry point independently of their efforts. The key is not 100% knowingly wasting other peoples' time. In addition, if you haven't heard anything from the recruiter in weeks, it's OK to assume their supposed lead has come to nothing. At times, it seems people act as if the recruiter is working 100% on their 'case', when in fact they are working multiple leads at multiple clients and probably devoting the most time to the newest and most promising leads. My guess is that the recruiter has forgotten all about you and moved on long ago. As a freelancer, I have regular contact with recruiters and generally there is no feedback unless an interview is scheduled. So - no news means the lead is dead. 

Updating his resume and getting out before everyone else might work in the short term - but T will probably also be(come) legacy at any new place. Any long-term solution involves becoming proficient in U. Depending on the role your friend has in the project, it could be a great opportunity for learning skill U in the context of T. If his role is merely explaining T to others who perform the actual conversion to U, he could seek to change that role. In any transitional phase, intermediates are often needed along the way. 

Depending on how relevant Russian is to the job being sought, it could go two places: 1) If important, put it near the top with info such as nationality, marital status and so on 2) If it's just a side note - and you have more certifications - perhaps list them all in a separate section 

In my opinion, not everything in a resume or application need be 100% relevant to the position sought, as a secondary purpose is actually to stand out from other applicants. When one has very little working experience, adding a 'quirky' or unusual personal interest - like playing the clarinet or oboe - can serve exactly that purpose. Imagine your application alongside 20 similar ones; chances are the employer will remember you as the clarinet-player. As long as the personal interest is merely listed and not elaborated on, the upside seems a lot larger than any potential downside. 

Meetings of this sort - meaningful as I believe they are - can be a bit tricky getting started as the employees very rarely or never have any contact with the upper levels, which may result in a reluctance to say anything not bland or vague. Depending on the industry (I'm assuming IT), the suggestions below may or may not be applicable. To kick things off, one could approach it as a twist on a SCRUM meeting where the team starts with a demo of the current state of the product being created, followed by a status report covering how work is proceeding, which steps are next and which obstacles there might be. Hopefully, this will spark an actual back-and-forth dialog rather than semi-nervous employees waiting on each other to ask the first question in a one-sided Q&A with upper management. 

You are basically asking for a 60% raise - and while that might even be fair, it could pose the employer some problems with his full-time staff who might expect similar raises. If you have been as valuable as you think and they acknowledge that they've low-balled you until now, they could give you more or less what you want. However, it usually turns out that one never really recovers from having accepted a lower level of pay without switching jobs. Even assuming your bargaining position is good - would you take a 30% increase? All employers would find that generous (if not outrageous) - but it would only be half of your target. Perhaps you could bargain for some additional perks such as flexible hours, more vacation, cellphone and so on. Another path could be to have another offer on the table. This might force your current employers hans - but hey could also resent you for it. 

Whether it is strange, weird or not is essentially a cultural matter. My context is Denmark in Northern Europe - where working in IT and not having a LinkedIn profile could probably be viewed as slightly odd. It doesn't need to be that thorough - most profiles are basically headlines - but an empty LinkedIn profile with a fake name and zero connections could signal that you are either 'off-the-grid paranoid' or have 'jobs, but not a career'. Not a show-stopper if you know your stuff - but if you have 2-3 other 'quirks', it could work against you. Regarding what LinkedIn may be used for, I have actually gotten two freelance jobs via LinkedIn (bypassing recruiters) - but that is the exception rather than the norm. LinkedIn IS used intensely by recruiters - and not participating probably does come at a cost, but it is difficult to measure lost opportunities of this sort. The biggest hassle - apart from people posting stuff that (IMHO) belongs on Facebook or similar - are the numerous connection requests from recruiters who have not even viewed my profile. These are rejected, as it seems they merely want to recursively spam my connections. 

Expert = Vast experience to the degree that others could be instructed (if the expert has teaching ability) CWK = Can work without supervision, but would quickly be 'found out' as an instructor 

Playing two parties against each other carries the risks others mention. Whether that risk is worth taking, could depend on what the reasonably likely upside would be. If both parties seem quite budget-constrained and your upside is probably only within the single-digit percentages, it seems the downside risks outweigh the upside. I would think the only way one could pull this off successfully without antagonizing your current employer, would be if they acknowledge that you are an absolute rock star that has been massively underpaid for quite some time. The fact that the recruiter wants to be told of any other offers is a reflection of you having the best hand. If unexpected things happen, your leverage will disappear quite quickly, thus turning the tables. In addition, even though your boss is a good guy, I have more than once been surprised at how resignations have been (mis-) handled when professionals all of a sudden take things very personally. Bottom line: If you are basically happy with the FirmB offer, take that and then quit. 

Asking the interviewer whether you are expected to prepare anything in advance, should be fine. The response will probably be a 'no', but it might also reveal what the more exact goal with the interview is. Personally, I would not study coding riddles as preparation, as that could just as easily increase anxiety on your part. 

No. There is very little upside (if any) to asking this question. If they choose to answer, the reply will probably be very generic, vague and therefore useless. The employer may have more interviews lined up - and even though you might have done well, perhaps the next two turn out even better. In addition, during an interview the applicant should display confidence, which asking this question does not.
