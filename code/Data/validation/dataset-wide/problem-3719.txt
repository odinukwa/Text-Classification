I like to exercises while watching TV, and don't particularly want to get more home exercise equipment (like a bar or stand). What equipment I have is mostly stuff my wife has used for pilates and physical therapy. I have small dumbbells up to 10 pounds, a yoga strap, a balance board and an inflatable exercise/stability ball. I usually do jumping jacks, pushups, crunches, various core/leg exercises, etc., but I'm looking specifically for exercises which would be useful in training for indoor rock climbing (mostly biceps and lat exercises). I've tried: 

In the book The Science of Yoga, William Broad discusses this in detail. My summary: for measures of cardiovascular fitness, Yoga is inferior to aerobic exercise. Indeed a small study of Yoga instructors (who do enormous amounts of yoga) found them to be roughly equivalent in measures of cardiovascular health (VO2 Max, etc) to someone who jogs 3-4 hours per week. Yoga is also inferior to weight training for gaining strength. Not really too surprising: exercises designed to specifically target certain ends are superior to flexibility exercises. However yoga does have significant benefits. He discusses studies showing that yoga can improve spinal health and treat back pain (one theory being that flexing the spine oxygenates the intervertebral discs, which may not get moved much in a sedentary lifestyle). It reduces stress hormones, may increase testosterone levels in men and various miscellaneous small benefits. The main large benefits seem to come in treating shoulder or back injuries. Personally, I do all three: yoga, weights and cardio. Of the three yoga is the most fun, so I'd say give it a try. The poses generally feel good, help with my back pain. It may not be superior to other forms of exercise on most measures, but it's worth doing for its own sake. 

I would like to increase my flexibility. Not necessarily every single part of my body but I would like to hit most if not all areas. I would like a set of several exercises that I can do one day or over several days for basically the rest of my life, to constantly improve my flexibility. What is the simplest, most necessary/important/commonly used(as in the muscle's flexibility is needed commonly in real life situations, not the stretch itself is commonly used) set of stretches that I could do to increase full body flexibility? 

Firstly you need to be able to do pull ups and chest dips. To train for muscle ups you will need to do lots of both of those two exercises. Pull ups and chest dips account for most of the muscle up move however the most difficult part of a muscle up is the transition. False grip training is highly recommended to improve the transition part of a muscle up. So incorporate false grip hangs and false grip pull ups. Aside from that, all you can do is the full muscle up move but with assistance, the same as when you probably first started doing pull ups; rest your legs on a stool or something to take some of the weight. Do the move quickly with a bit of a jump at the start. Go to the top of the move and then slowly go down to a hang. 

Whenever I do a pull up or a chin up my palms hurt, like where your knuckles are but on the palm side. I feel like it's being squished and stretched. After I perform a few, say 3, it's difficult to move my fingers at all for a bit, like it's very stiff in that position. Is this normal for someone just starting out? (both exercise and these particular exercises) I've recently lost a considerable amount of weight (~20kg) could this be a reason as to why my palm is hurting? I'm thinking of this because maybe the skin is looser. Is there any way I can avoid this? I've tried wearing (gardening) gloves but it didn't help, it was the same. Should I continue doing these exercises? Will it eventually become less painful? 

If this is the tactic you're taking, I highly recommend the Hacker's Diet by John Walker (available as a free website/ebook). The theory is pretty simple: track your weight and calories daily, and reduce calories when your weight trend line is trending up, increase them when it is trending down more than you'd like. He's created a simple online tool to track your weight and generate nice trend graphs. Feedback based on the weight trend automatically takes into account reductions in metabolism, exercise, etc. The key point is not to take any weight measurement seriously by itself: keep calories/diet reasonably consistent and look at the longer term trend. That said, while I love Walker's weight tracking tool, I've never found calorie tracking very tenable. So tedious and difficult to keep up with. I much prefer adjusting the foods I eat until I find a diet that leads to weight loss over time. The trend line is still useful for determining when to change things or when changes don't work, but calorie counting is not for me. 

Stay away from antioxidant vitamins, at least C and E. There is a study from 2009, suggesting that vitamin C and E supplementation negate some of the beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity of exercise. Also linked from that post is another paper showing that vitamin C supplementation decreases endurance gains from exercise. 

Yes there are muscles between your ribs. They're called the intercostal muscles, though "soreness in ribs" might also be caused by soreness in your pectoralis minor (which connects to the front of the rib cage) or your serratus anterior (which connect your back to the side of your rib cage). A good hint that it's muscle soreness instead of connective tissue soreness is that muscle soreness usually feels good to massage, while tendon/ligament/joint soreness does not. The main use of the intercostal muscles is in opposing the diaphragm in breathing, but they're used in lots of movements. I get rib soreness after doing planks for a long period, so I suspect that is the main source of the soreness (a pushup being a like plank++). I would guess that the reason that your intercostal muscles are sore is because they are being used to hold the rib cage rigid, while forces are being transmitted between the serratus, pectoralis minor and rectus abdiminous. Dynamic tension between these muscles (and many others) lets your back stay flat and rigid while you're doing planks or pushups, but since a lot of the force is transmitted through the rib cage, your intercostal muscles contract and get stretched as you go through the movements. Like any other muscles after a working/stretching them, they get sore. It's probably especially noticeable since you do very few exercises which exercise your ribs. Here's a video showing the main muscle groups used in pushups, and here's an animation showing them in action. Hopefully you can see the stresses put on the rib cage. Pushups are really great exercises precisely because (if done properly) they strengthen so many different muscle groups (even ones you were unaware you had!). This is also one of the problems with Nautilus machines for strength training: by isolating muscles you miss out on strengthening small stabilizing muscles like the intercostal muscles and you can end up with big muscles but not genuine strength (and an increased risk of injury). I find that stretching my rib cage can help with soreness (though stretching beforehand or immediately after doesn't do very much). For soreness from pushups, my ribs tend to get more sore on the sides of my body, and a good stretch for that is the side angle pose from yoga. Finally, it's interesting that you get rib soreness after situps. I haven't had that experience, though situps are also complex exercises which use a lot of different muscles groups. Perhaps another answerer can go into that in more detail. There are a ridiculously enormous number of muscles in your back and shoulders. Planks are really complicated exercises. 

Hypertrophy means that your muscles are bigger, but does this mean that they don't perform better or worse than smaller muscles? Is it really possible for hypertrophy of the muscles to have no functional effects? Would you gain at least some strength? Are there any negative functional effects? I've heard that bigger muscles makes you less flexible, is this true? So what are the functional effects both positive and negative of hypertrophy? 

I believe that the below exercises are the minimum to train the most amount of muscles that also requires minimal equipment: 

I currently train them by just from a standing position going up onto the tips of my toes. Some variations I did were holding weights at the same time or doing one leg at a time which improves balance too. However it's come to my attention that there are two main groups in the calves and that tip toe exercise I've been doing only works one of them. I've read that for the other one your leg needs to be bent like in a sitting position. All the sites I saw showed exercises on this machine where you would sit and lift up a weight on your knees. What can I do at home to workout the other part of my calves. I've tried placing dumbbells on my knees but not only is this uncomfortable but I don't feel tired from this. I don't think I'm getting much benefit from it. What exercises can I do to train this other muscle group? 

Firstly I would suggest going very easy for a while, for the same reason you stopped for over a year when your gym closed for a month. You lost the habit of exercising every week. You need to get that back by having a routine even if it's not very much weight or very intense or whatever. Since your goals are purely to lose weight and you're not worried about maintaining muscle mass or strength I would recommend doing HIIT combined with a caloric deficit diet instead of a strength program like stronglifts. Even cardio would be better for your goals than lifting. 

In other words, high intensity intervals led to increased fat loss, and increased some measures of insulin sensitivity. Here's a link to a few more studies, with promising results. That said, HIIT can be quite difficult, probably more difficult than standard cardio or many types of strength training. So while I'd recommend trying HIIT, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good: the best exercise is the exercise you do. Giving up on an exercise program burns 0 calories. Another aspect to consider is ancillary benefits. IMHO, improving strength and flexibility will make you feel better faster than cardio or HIIT. Strength training can improve pain of various sorts (especially back pain) and make it easier to start other kinds of exercise programs. 

As for exercise, I would say start with walking, but if that's difficult because of your arthritis, I don't know. Try to move however is comfortable for you, even if it's not much. I'd suggest getting some 5 pound hand weights and just sort of playing with them while you watch TV. For example, lift your arms out to the side, do bicep curls, etc. A Youtube search for "exercises for the morbidly obese" turned up a number of home-videos of exercise advice from very overweight people, many heavier than you. I'm not specifically recommending any of them, but they seem like a good place for you to start your research. See which exercises look attainable and safe and try some of those out. Weight loss is a really agonizingly slow process. The main point is to make sure that it's consistent. Getting down to a healthier weight is probably a multi-year commitment. Losing a pound a week is a pretty agressive, but doable target for most people. But even a pound ever two or three weeks is still movement in the right direction. Expecting faster loss is what discourages a lot of people. Still, it's worth getting started for two reasons. The first is that even relatively small weight loss can lead to significant decreases in the risk for diseases like diabetes. The second is that all weight loss is just trucking on with good habits. If you mess up, don't exercise, binge eat, whatever, none of that matters now. What matters is what you do today, not what you did yesterday that you weren't supposed to. That was the key insight for me both with quitting smoking and losing weight. If I slipped up and smoked a cigarette, that didn't mean that I "started smoking again", it meant that I "had smoked on one occasion". Similarly, if you eat too much one day, that doesn't mean you've stopped losing weight. It's just a temporary setback, not an end to the journey. Good luck! 

It's the pulling exercise that I'm mainly concerned about, I'm doing dead lift as I read it somewhere but after doing it for the first time I felt like the dead lift was more of a legs exercise. Is it an appropriate exercise to fill the "pull" slot in my workout? What would be a pull exercise that I could use instead if deadlift does not meet the pull criteria? 

I've recently started lifting at home, I have some weights, a bench press setup, a barbell and two dumbbells. I would like to include deadlifts in my workout but I feel like I'm not doing it with correct form. What can I do at home to learn how to deadlift and ensure my form is good and proper and to improve it if it is not? I realize that a personal trainer would probably be the best bet but I'd like to neither pay nor go out of my way to do it. I'd like to be able to learn to do it myself at home. 

So to answer your question, yes it is possible to have gained 25kg in six months however the chances of gaining 25kg of muscle is impossible. Over the course of their lifetime, maybe but not six months. The other weight can possibly be attributed to fat. If you had measured their body fat percentage before and after you would be able to see how much was fat and how much was lean mass. 

But what would you do if your final goal was two of them? Say you wanted to get a lot of strength as well as endurance for example. How would you proceed? Would you follow the graphs recommendations for one day or week on one goal and then the next week is for the other goal? Would you average out the variables? Would you spend several months on one and then the other? What would you do? 

Small changes in a flux of 6Kg/day can change your weight considerably. I've been tracking my weight for almost a year in a similar manner to you, and I find that the day after I go running, I frequently lose up to 2KG or around 2.5% of body mass! I then proceed to gain all that back over the next two days, and I'm back approximately where I started. My theory is that I'm depleting/replenishing my glycogen stores, which take up several times their weight in water, though other factors are presumably at work. In any case, daily fluctuations of 2Kg are in no way uncommon for me, and they're probably unavoidable. Walker suggests using a (smoothed) moving average to factor out daily fluctuations, and only look at the trend line, which has worked well for me. 

A great place to start would be watching this young woman's youtube videos. She started out in a similar place to you (not knowledgeable about nutrition, overweight her whole life, ~330Lb, etc.), and has lost approximately 180 pounds over the course of a few years. Many of her videos contain extremely practical and specific advice, and her story is pretty inspirational. I think the most important thing she did was research losing weight for 4 months before starting on her weight loss plan. When she started, she knew pretty much what to expect, and was motivated to continue tweaking her plan as some things worked, and some didn't. I've read a lot about losing weight, and lost around 50 pounds in the last year. I don't think anyone but you can figure out a diet/exercise routine that will work for you. You need to find a set of dietary changes and ways to introduce exercise into your life that will lead to long-term changes. I can recommend a few things that worked for me, but they may not all work for you. I'm sure there are things that will work for you that no one here has listed. Experimentation is key. I'd suggest trying out the ones that sound appealing or manageable (especially the first one), and go from there.
