If lice are a problem, go back to town, get the necessary supplies, and deal with it the right way. Yes it can be fun to play mountain man and try to source everything from the land. But that usually results in ecological damage. This scenario is no exception. 

It's a novel idea, but it's not going to work in any practical sense. Most of those foams take about 15 minutes to setup, and you'll have to come up with some way to fabricate a mold while you spray it. It will be about an hour before you could safely enter your foam sarcophagus, and if this is to be used in an emergency situation, that's probably not time you're going to want to stand around and wait for the stuff to cure. From my experience using the stuff for sealing purposes, I think you'd be lucky to get a cubic foot (about 30 liters) out of a can. The best R-value I can find for Great Stuff brand spray foams is about 2-3. Compare that to something like an example sleeping pad. The linked pad has an R-value of 4.9, and an inflated volume of about 2 cubic feet. As we can all know, a single sleeping pad is not going to be enough to keep you warm at the freezing point, even if you use it as a blanket. You'd have to use 4 cans just to simulate the insulation capabilities of a typical sleeping pad. You'll need many, many more to complete your sleeping vessel. Additionally, you're going to end up with a solid, bulky mass of foam that you are going to haul out, and the cured foam is not biodegradable and it will be like managing a Styrofoam cooler making a mess everywhere, as well as all the empty aerosol cans. There might be other foams that could work, but you won't be able to get them from the hardware store, and they won't cost only 4 bucks/can. 

The difference is mostly one of administrative/bureaucratic elements. Both are protected areas, the difference is in who creates and manages them. All National Parks are run by the National Park Service (NPS), part of the US Department of the Interior. Creation of new national parks is done through an act of congress. Creation of a new park using land administered by a different dept, such as a National Forest which is managed by the Dept of Agriculture, would also require congressional action to reassign that section of land. National Monuments on the other hand, can be created on any federally owned land, through presidential authority alone. Congress can create monuments as well, but authority is not exclusive to them as is for NPS. Additionally, management of a National Monument can be done by whatever agency is appropriate. Many National Monuments are run and managed by the NPS, but not all. Some are maintaind by the US Forest Service, some by the BLM, one by the Dept of Energy, one by the Air Force and others. Whereas without exception all National Parks must be managed by the NPS. Apart from that, there is really no significant necessary difference, as whether a given place feels like a park, museum, or something else will depend more on what the protected area contains rather than who's running it. Being a park does have a somewhat narrower criteria than national monuments, but you'll see more variation within the two groups than between. 

I hope you like a non-answer. There rarely ever is a theoretically optimal time to tack that can be described in the abstract, as there are so many unknown, random variables. The best time to tack, for pure speed, is never. But never isn't a practical answer, as you usually have an ultimate destination or things to avoid, and the wind isn't constant, so you have to weigh your current course against those things, and so it usually boils down to experienced judgement and gut feeling. Let's look at two simple beating strategies: 

Smart Wool main claim to fame is that their treated wool doesn't itch as bad or shrink as much in washing machines. Otherwise, its all the same stuff as far as its insulating capabilities go. 

PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) bottles are not "special" containers, they are the most widespread containers holding potable water in the world, with more than 100 million used per day. Now, you don't necessarily need a bottle made of PET, but even a basic reading and understanding of how the SODIS process works should make it obvious why using anything other than a PET bottle is pointless. SODIS is more than just basic sunlight. SODIS is performed by filling a bottle about 3/4 full, shaking the water vigorously for at least 20 seconds, then putting the bottle in the sun for a minimum of 5 hours, for up to several days, ideally with a reflective element around the bottle to concentrate as much sunlight into the water as is practical. The way this works is through 2 methods. First and foremost is the interaction with UV-A and the dissolved oxygen in the water. UV-A is barely ionizing radiation, and it will form free radicals and hydrogen peroxides in the water by interacting with the oxygen. These substances are very nasty to microorganisms. Additionally, the entire sunlight band helps warm the water. The warmer the water, the more effective the free radicals and peroxides are. The less UV and heat that can be delivered to the water, the less effective the process will be. If you're in a cold-weather area far in the north, SODIS may never be suitable. So, to use something other than PET, you need to provide something that doesn't absorb UV radiation, and is effective at keeping the water warm. Glass and Polycarbonate both absorb UV, so with Glass, PC, and PET out, whatever you are left with is going to be far more "special" and uncommon I'm not even going to offer an alternative. So no, a shallow pan will not work. It neither provides a means to oxygenate the water, nor will it keep it warm. If you are going to hike in the back country, be prepared, and that means not improvising with critical wellness aspects like safe drinking water when it takes almost no effort or cost to bring the right supplies. 

Ultimately, every element of boat design is a trade-off of some sort. As you make adjustments for better and better sailing performance, your result will start looking less and less like a canoe and more like a traditional sailing boat. Only you can decide where there right balance is. 

Some of us, when adventuring, go to far off remote places, in very cold or wet areas, and carry everything with us on our backs. But not everyone does that. Some people only car camp, in the summer, where bathrooms and showers are 200 feet away. For those sorts of camping situations, people's needs in a sleeping bag are essentially nothing more than 'portable bed linen'. For those situations, cotton lined sleeping bags are cheap and comfortable. So, without any specific details about the make/model of sleeping bag you got, all I can speculate is that you purchased a car-camping, coleman type sleeping bag that is unfit for winter camping. 

From the sounds of it, to develop all the skills you are interested in, you are not going to learn them all with a single class. Additionally, it will likely take several years to hone your skills to a point that you can depend on them. For learning how to harness the wind, it is better to learn on a smaller boat. Something like a sunfish, laser, or a Hobie 16 catamaran is ideal. Because of the light weight of the boat, it will give better, more immediate feedback to how well you are operating your sails. A Sunfish, with only you in it, will only weigh maybe 300 pounds or so, and is capable of stopping almost immediately if you dump your sails or improperly turn upwind. A much larger boat, weighing 2000 pounds or more, if you have decent speed can easily coast through a shoddily performed turn, and while it can be a little more forgiving in easy weather, it comes at a result of making it harder to develop core sailing technical skills. Furthermore, smaller boats don't have as much inertia, so you can be a bit more aggressive and try more difficult maneuvers, and capsizing them is virtually a non-issue. The smaller boats are also less expensive. You'll be much more willing to push the boundaries of your skill with an $1,500 boat than an $80,000 yacht. As far as lake size goes, it isn't terribly important, anything about a square mile in size or more is sufficiently large for a small boat like a sunfish. If you are honing your technical skills, you're going to be tacking or gybing virtually non-stop. Obviously, if you are learning on a huge 40 foot yacht, you're going to need a bigger lake. In my opinion, smaller is better than bigger for learning base technical skills. When you start moving on to bigger boats, you don't so much learn more 'sailing' skills, you learn mariner skills. The new stuff you learn isn't about capturing wind, but of navigation, rights of way, maintaining equipment on your boat, handling sleeping while at sea, and more. The sails get bigger, but their basics of operation are mostly the same. I'm going to end there, because I don't want to write a novel on going from complete novice to master of the seas. Once you are capable and confident to sail around a small lake from any point to any other point, in a wide range of weather, you'll know what you'll need to learn and work on to make a trip to Ontario or elsewhere. 

Not really. Not the answer you want, but your body is telling you something, you need to listen to it. It's a lot of fun, but you need to take it slow to ease your body into it. Otherwise the fun is going to come to an end. I've heard a lot of stories from people that buy things like these: $URL$ then go crazy trying as many one knuckle pullups they can before their muscles and tendons are strong enough for it, and ultimately injure themselves so bad they have to take several months or a year off of climbing. It sounds like you're on your way to doing something similar. 

A good portion of it is usually forest, but not always. Case in point, I visited the Cloud Peak Wilderness in Wyoming this summer, contained in the Bighorn National Forest. While much of it was forested and wooded:
