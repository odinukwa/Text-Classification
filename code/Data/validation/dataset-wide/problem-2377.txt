"Medicines" There are some things in the BMC which I think are very misleading, especially concerning, "medicines" and how "Any Reason" is defined (p232). I could not find any pāli evidence that mentions "hunger and fatigue" as a valid medical reason. I could be wrong, but I asked a couple of knowledgeable monks to verify this and they also agreed with my findings. This would exclude many things which are considered medicines. I will not cover further with lists of the "medicines." Only that there should be a valid reason for taking them and justifying their use after Noon. The reflection and criteria are below. It is in every monastery chanting book and should be chanted every day. (Nauyana chanting book source) "Medicine Reflection" 

Or even no four noble truths or eightfold path. So not much left. So hopefully this giving a flavour of the radical nature of emptiness. Please note this isn't a complete answer. There are other areas of Nāgārjuna's philosophy that I haven't covered such as the two truths largely due to a complete absence of knowledge on my part. 

As well as being a preeminent teacher of Tibetan Buddhist, Chögyam Trungpa was notorious for his more extreme behaviour such as drinking, smoking, sleeping with students, crashing cars and so forth. While this seems unusual behaviour for an advanced Buddhist practioner I was told that senior figures in his lineage (Kagyu and Nyingma) and were very comfortable with his actions. So how were his more controversial actions justified by others within his lineage? Is there a tradition within Tibetan Buddhism which encompasses seemingly unethical behaviour? Was there any precedence within his lineage for this kind of thing or was he just a very unusual character? 

Remember: we are not among bullets and persecution; we are not working ourselves to exhaustion; we don't have mental or physical restrictions; we have this precious human life of leisure and opportunity to be happy, to make others happy, to meditate on the four noble truths and to release ourselves from ignorance and to ease the suffering of all sentient beings. Our lives are finite, they can end right this moment; there is no time to waste. In order to have a good death we have to have a good life, not tomorrow... today. A good life is not a life full of pleasures or achievements, is a life full of love, compassion and truth for ourselves and others. 

Masterbation is unwholesome just like getting angry is unwholesome. Getting angry is not recommended, but it is not against a precept. I think there is confusion with abrahmacariya precept taken with 8 and 10 precepts. This precept replaces the third sexual misconduct precept of regular followers and requires complete celibacy. Abstinence from sensual pleasures are covered in this rule and also in the other higher precepts included in the eight/ten group. These precepts are taken by serious lay followers and novice monks. Bhikkhus must do manata/parivasa (probation) if they do such an act. It is very serious for a monk to do such a thing and very serious legal act to rehabilitate. Often, separate "prison monasteries" are set up for this purpose in Asia because of the difficulties in the logistics to carry out such a task. Novice monks ask to do chores (danda kamma) if they break this. It should be noted that the only difference in precepts of a lay person and a novice monk is the tenth precept of not using money. As far as the third precept (sexual misconduct) is concerned for the five precept yogi; "It takes two to tango." 

Over the last few months I've distanced myself from my sangha and from Buddhism in general. I still meditate but no longer identify as a Buddhist. One of the things I've noticed is the return of some old ambitions or longer term desires if you like. I don't think they are negative in fact they could have quite positive outcomes though I do recognise that they are driven by a restlessless sort of dissatisfaction. In the light of my recent experience it makes me wonder if Buddhism necessarily dampens down people's ambitions? Is it possible to be ambitious (in any sense) and a Buddhist or are the two things mutually exclusive. For a Buddhist is ambition a negative thing? 

In this case, two preoccupations are arising: the pursuit of stimulus-driven pleasure and its counterpart, the avoidance of discomfort. As long as we crave for pleasure, we will suffer. Rewarding ourselves with stimulus for having gone through some suffering will only lead us to more craving, because we're coping with suffering by means of stimulus. There is nothing wrong with watching movies or to relax; what drives us to suffer from such activities is that we haven't done what's important today (this doesn't mean work): the acts that will lead us to a good death. One solution here is to meditate on our precious human life of leisure and opportunity, and on the inevitability of our death. If we don't act now, tomorrow will be too late; there is no time to loose today if we haven't worked on our spiritual practice, our tours, our work, our goals. If we have, today we can watch the movie without fear, as if we die this instant, we won't feel we have wasted our lives (and because watching this movie will help us tomorrow to act with virtue, i.e., a good motivation). 

2. Ratnasambhava - the yellow Buhha Mudra is the dana or giving mudra. The hand points downward and out (shown by NeilD). This points to generosity. 3. Amitabha - the red budda Mudra is the meditation or dhyana mudra. Hands together (show by NeilD). This obviously points to contemplation 4. Amoghasiddhi - the green buddha Mudra is the fearlessness or abhaya mudra. Hand is up and poitn forward (shown by NeilD). This is self explanatory I think. 5. Vairocana - the white buddha Mudra is the wheel-turning or Dharmacakrapravartana mudra (again shown by NeilD). This which fits his central place in the mandala, bringing all the other qualities together. 

I will be hopefully writing a readable version of the fifth method in my Abhidhamma Lessons located at $URL$ . It is planned for Lesson #9 and cumulative knowledge is assumed from lesson #1 onward. I am currently writing lesson #8 on mental factors. My guess is that it will be released sometime in November. I announce new lessons via gplus or Facebook. I will try to remember to update this entry when/if it gets finished. 

For bhikkhus, Some vegetables are not allowable. Better to do juice and mix with cool water. The BMC says boiled juices are sugar. This is only Thai Tradition. BMC will list the vegetables and fruits allowable. Cucumber is not allowable. Boiled juices are prohibited by paauk Tea is actually not allowable as a "drink" for this reason of heating. Leaf juice is allowable, but you cannot add boiling water. Hence the rule of only warming by the sun's heat. You should be "sick and have a reason" for any medicine. This would outlaw, cold green tea. Aka Snapple. Juice drinks or sugar mixed with water can be taken for any reason, including thirst. 

Sooner or later, we'll realize that the only way to reduce our suffering in this life, is to help reduce the suffering of others. To have the strength to do it, we'll need very strong motivations. 

To me, this solution is still focused on craving/aversion. The reason why we feel upset is because "we crave" acceptance, which is one of the eight worldly preoccupations: the pursuit of praise. As long as we're holding to this "craving", there is not small enough set of people whose opinions will lead us to suffering. 

Using our emotions as fuel for the pursuit of material acquisitions and the avoidance of their loss is even a greater pathway to suffering. Not only we're identifying with our emotions, but we are using them to increase our ignorance. There is nothing wrong with being with other people; there is nothing wrong with being other people. They, as us, are there trying to be happy, trying to make other people happy, and trying to avoid suffering. No amount of money or status in the world will prevent us from feeling or seeing ours and other peoples' suffering. 

Over the last few months I've started meditating late on a night (as well as my usual morning practice). I'm finding that I am sleeping less but not feeling tired because of it. Is there any information around about how mediation may or may not affect sleep patterns? For instance Dipa Ma, the Indian housewife and meditation teacher was up at 4.00 am every morning to meditate for a few hours presumably finding that perfectly OK. That said Margaret Thatcher only slept for 4 hours a night and I would hesitate to call her a Buddhist meditation master. 

Does Buddhism have this kind of concept of blasphemy in the canonical texts and associated commentaries. I appreciate that there are now cultural sensitivities in certain countries around Buddhism and Buddhist iconography but I'm interested in references from the texts about this rather than modern interpretations. 

Our ultimate purpose is using the practices to liberate ourselves of all relative conditionings, not only to improve them. Tenzing Wangyal Rinpoche 

Again, for me, this solution is still focused on craving/aversion. In this case, the worldly preoccupation is the avoidance of discomfort. Discomfort is inevitable; what is not is our reaction to it. For example, one could deal with this specific problem by doing loving-kindness with all the crowd, or thinking that we're exposed to this crowd in order to do virtuous actions (such as work) which will lead to the ease of suffering for ourselves and others (i.e., "I'm carrying this suffering so other people won't have to", or "as many others have suffered for me, this is my time to suffer for others").
