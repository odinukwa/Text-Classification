As a Manager, whenever you have an issue with an employee, you owe it to them to discuss it individually, and in private. Over the years I've had personality clashes that I felt the individual didn't understand. I discussed how I felt they were coming across to me, and to others. And I discussed ways I thought they could change their behaviors and be more cognizant as to how they are coming across. I think you should sit down with this new employee, and say something like "We are thrilled to have you with us, and we know you'll do a good job. But as your Manager, I think I owe it to you to talk with you about some issues that might hinder your relationship with others here." Then, you can explain what he has done that makes you and others feel he is becoming overly-familiar. Chance are, he doesn't even realize how his behavior is being perceived by your team. It bothers me a bit when you write "He was very friendly and eager but otherwise normal", as if being friendly and eager makes him abnormal. I suspect by that definition I, and most of my co-workers would be abnormal, because most of us are friendly, and most are eager, too. Perhaps there is something about your company or your team that is more reserved/conservative than most companies? If so, all the more reason for you to step up and talk with your new employee to gently guide him to the cultural norms in your company. Don't wait - for his benefit and for the benefit of your team, do it now. (While I strongly recommend that you have this one-on-one chat yourself, if for some reason you simply cannot, perhaps there is someone senior on your team would would be appropriate for this conversation. In my shop, when we bring a new person on board, I assign a mentor to help the new employee learn the systems, the people, etc. While having this sort of a chat wouldn't be expected of the mentor in my shop, perhaps in your company that would work well.) 

You have already publicly expressed your minimum salary requirement. If they offer at least that much, you accept. You thank them, express how excited you are to get going, and determine your start date. If they offer less, you simply reject the offer. You thank them for their consideration, but remind them that you already told them the minimum you require. If they claim they can't afford to pay you the minimum you require because they are a startup, remember that this isn't your problem. You require a certain amount. If they can't meet that, then you can't work for them. Move on to a company that can pay you. 

Since you are hiding the fact that you were employed by this company, the answer to the question 1 is likely to be awkward. Depending on which of the 7 companies you worked for was this employer, the answers to questions 2 and 3 could be awkward. I suppose you could hope that this reference would never actually be checked, but that's not a risk I would take. (When I ask your reference about the connection, I expect the reference would say "I was Pati's manager at Company X", to which I would think "Why did Pati leave Company X off of her CV? And what else did she omit?" A big red flag would go up.) 

It's perfectly reasonable to say something along the lines of: "Hey, boss. I noticed that my rate is higher than before. Did I get a raise?" If your boss answers in the affirmative, you should indeed say "Thanks!" It seems rather odd to me that your boss wouldn't have mentioned it, but it does happen. My wife regularly receives her raises without prior notice or discussion. 

Whenever something dramatically bad happens in a small company, I find that the best way forward is to meet it head on. A full company meeting should be held to talk about what happened, and what the company plans to do now. People should be free to ask any questions they like, and the questions should be answered publicly. I would expect senior management to get together before the meeting and decide specifically if they have a problem with salary structures or not. And if they do, what they will do in general, and what they will do about the acute cases specifically. In general, a review of everyone's salary seems appropriate. For every single employee, their salary should be checked and measured against both the market and the other employees in similar positions. Competent HR people know how to do this. If the company doesn't have sufficiently qualified HR folks, then an outside group should be consulted or retained. Special attention needs to be paid to all formal complaints and those threatening discrimination lawsuits. The facts of the case need to be determined, and action planned based on those facts. Again, good HR knows how to deal with this. And if necessary, there are groups that specialize in defending discrimination lawsuits. Going forward, senior management needs to decide if keeping salaries secret is worthwhile or not (some companies and many public sector employers make everyone's salary public knowledge). Doing so would likely be a huge culture change at this company and is not to be undertaken lightly. And going forward, the company needs to decide if the current salary structure is equitable or not. And if not, they need to figure out how to make it equitable, and keep it that way. I would expect individual follow-up one-on-one with every employee and their manager. I would expect them to talk about their salary, and why it is appropriate or why it isn't, as well as what will happen going forward. 

When you say "the corporate ladder", I suspect your thinking might be too constrained. Certainly many businesses want leaders that devote significant time and energy to the company. Certainly some business involves sedentary work. Some businesses are inside. And many businesses are stressful. But not all! There are "ladders" which involve physical activity, time outdoors, and perhaps low stress. If these are important factors in your life (and it sounds like you believe they are), then you need to put yourself in a position to maximize those attributes in your work life. And then there are folks who are self-employed. They get to decide for themselves what their work life is like. They can craft their work to meet their individual needs exactly. 

Are you sure that salary is the only sticking point here? You mention a changing company culture, that what attracted you to this company is "eroding", and that you are feeling burnt out. These are all classic signs of someone who really wants to leave - without even factoring in your feelings about salary. In my experience, an increase in salary never really compensates for these other factors - perhaps it will be different for you. Anyway, let's assume that salary is indeed the only obstacle, and suggest an approach for you. First, make sure your three job offers are firm. If your negotiations with your current employer don't work out, you want to make sure you have a good place to go. Then, go to your boss and be honest. Tell him that while you weren't searching a month ago, things have changed recently. You have found a new position which is offering you the salary you seek. But you would prefer to stay with the company because you like them so much, if only it weren't for the salary. Ask him directly "Do you think you could pay me Â£10,000 more?" Be prepared with how you intend to respond for all possible answers:
