Let me explain it like this. They have one opening and 350 applicants who meet the minimum requirement. Most of the people who meet the qualification will not be interviewed. You have to have something that makes you stand out from the stack of resumes. When I first graduated from college, it was year when there were almost no entry level jobs available for economic reasons. I would get these terribly discouraging letters back saying, "Out of the 700 applications for this position, you were not one of the three we decide to interview." You may have to apply to hundreds of places to land a job. Even with experience. What that taught me was that I always have to do something or get some experience that will make me stand out in a huge stack of resumes; it had certainly never occurred to me that I would be in competition with that many people. That principle has guided me ever since and now I rarely have trouble getting an interview because I have both strong skills and, more importantly, a strong history of significant accomplishments. But you have to start thinking this way - that you have to be a standout - in order to reach this stage. For instance, reading a stack of resumes, I can generally sort them into: 

I would take this to your boss and make the assumption that it was done in error and ask him to clear it up. 

Consider looking at data analyst positions. There are lots of good paying postions where database knowldge is critical. Report wrtiers are in high demand. BI specialists are in high demand. 

The interviewer is asking what is it about you that makes you the person we should choose for this out all the people we are interviewing. This is your chance to sell them on what it is about you that makes you a better choice for the job than anyone else. 

You simply do not mention your manager at all. Do not say anything negative about him or the company. You say something like you are looking for new challenges or to broaden your experience if the potential job offers that. You say something like you are really interested in their business domain of it is in a different one than the one you are in. Or you can even say that you feel that the corporate culture doesn't suit you if the company you are looking at is significantly different as far as culture than the one you are in. Be prepared for questions about what kind of corporate culture you would be more comfortable in if that is the case. Focus on what you like about the company you are interviewing with as a reason to leave. 

If he was not like this to you before your promotion, then it is possible he is jealous and is deliberately trying to get you demoted so he can get promoted. This is a most dangerous situation and you took all the wrong moves by not immediately reacting to his put-downs. You cannot afford to ever let someone be dismissive of you in public when he works for you. Not even in a joking manner. Good work is not just about technical competence. No one can afford to keep an employee with a bad attitude and that is what you have. Since you have an organizational problem too of being in charge without authority (in the future, do yourself a favor and don't accept a managment job withouth authority), you need to discuss how to handle with your boss. But this is what I recoemmend. The person who is his actual official supervisor needs to sit down with him and HR in a meeting and tell him this behavior is unacceptable and that if it does not stop, he will be fired. This person is a cancer in the team and he needs to fix his attitude or be gone. What he is doing is harming you, it is harming the team reputation and it is harming him (Even if he succeeds in getting you demoted, the likelihood is that they would pick someone else becaue no one wants to have a known snake as a subordinate manager and it is likely part of why he wasn't chosen in the first place.) 

IF you don't resign until after the match is made, the chances that you will get the match are low unless you sue them for it. I would put in my resignation on Jan 2. Because they may not accept a Jan 1 last day and let you go effective immediately. What I would do it talk to my new employer, explain how much money you could potentially lose if you put in a resignation mow and see if they want you enough to make up the difference or if they are willing to wait for you to put in Notice in 2018. If they don't agree to one or the other, then you need to weigh whether this job is worth more than the money you may not get. Next time think about this sort of thing before you look for new work. It would have been smarter to wait until the new year at this point to look. Same thing with expected bonuses, wait til you get them to resign. These payments are to encourage employee retention, it defeats the purpose for the company and they often will not pay out if you quit at the wrong time. Certainly, most companies I know of would release you in early Dec anyway as that is often a slow period and it doesn't make economic sense to the finance guys to pay you a match when you aren't going to stay. 

I think you want to be relatively conservative in the design of your personal cards for most professions. The exception is for people who will be working in the arts. My cards for my day job are very vanilla, the cards I give to gallery owners are a mini-portfolio of my art (see moo.com, if you want to do this) and that way they can pick one they really like to remember me by and I always have a portfolio with me that fits easily in my purse. And proofread, prooofread, proofread. They can't call you if the phone number is wrong. 

I will point out that they are in a different professional specialties than yours. So there is no comparison between their rate of promotion and yours. To be promoted several things have to happen, first you have to have a position to be promoted to. They may have senior dev positions in their budget but there are no senior sys admin positions in your organization's budget. No position, no possibility of promotion. The next thing is performance as measured by your boss not you. What is important about this is that it is up to you to make sure your boss is well aware of your contributions. Sys Admin is tough to shine in because no news is good news. When things just work correctly and there are no big fires to put out, then it isn't very noticeable. You need to make sure they see you are keeping disasters from happening. Finally, you generally need to ask for promotions (or apply for vacant higher positions). You don't ever get what you don't ask for. And be aware that the workplace is not and never will be fair. People who don't deserve promotions get promoted all the time. (And most of the time there will be someone in the organization who thinks the promotion was undeserved no matter who got promoted as very few people are universally respected.) The best employees don't always get the best salaries as best is subjective and some jobs command higher salaries all around. You can't let that affect your own motivation and performance. When you do that, you deserve to be the person who didn't get promoted or didn't get the bonus. 

I think you need to think about the purpose of the meetings. It is unusual for a person who is not your direct manager to do one on ones with you. So there must be a compelling reason for this. If it is because your boss is too busy (and 50 people is too many to supervise effectively), then they are still trying to make sure any concerns you have are heard and that is a good thing. Or it is possible that he is doing one on ones because they are planning to reorganize the workplace as 50 people is too many to supervise and he might be your new boss in the near future or he might be evaluating you for inclusion in his team. In this case, this is your chance to shine and impress him. Or it could be that very senior managment is looking to find out what people think of your current boss. In any event, you need to make sure you do your best to talk to the manager and make sure your concerns are heard and that your accomplishments are noticed. It is trickier since you don't directly work for this person, so be more careful about what you say and how you say it. Be assured that complaints about your current boss will get back to him, so don't say anything about him that you wouldn't and haven't said to his face. Do not assume confidentiality in this meeting (or any one on one for that matter). @DJClayworth make an excellent point:
