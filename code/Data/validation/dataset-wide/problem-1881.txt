By now, you must have been through tests/interviews, aptitude checks and so on. So what's new that VP Technology will check that others' haven't? Like me, i have seen many senior management staff tend to gauge your potential rather than many specifics. Essentially, they will ask themselves whether you are worthy of investing time and energy on. This implies you will be evaluated in aspects such as: 

I think single most criteria that determines this is the intellectual property related to work and product at hand. In general, when some problem is very specific publishing without context might be hard. But there are broader solutions which are good to publish but should you really do this? I will answer this by example: Out here, we have tried to implement a core algorithms in one our key product. We didn't published them as papers (or as blogs) but did filed for patents (which is also publishing by the way) - this is because Intellectual property for the same was very crucial. And would definitely give away strong advantage over competition. However, at the same time - we also ended up creating a new design over the database access (a typical ORM model if you know). While this is very interesting and would invite quite a bit of academic interest and also it is no harm to share with world around. Many large companies specially their research wings have continuous work towards open publishing (such as papers, books, blogs) as well as owned publishing (such as patents). The criteria for going either way is the significance of intellectual property involved. 

By all means communicate to your new idea and then come to conclusion in consensus with your boss what should we do now. 

I can vouch for you, this fear is real. With my last boss, i had faced this. Note, i had been a free lancer facing customer directly, had a significant team in various jobs and even before my boss joined this current company (in the start up days) - i have already established myself as a significant achiever. I had nothing to fear and i had never feared with any one! But with him? what's the issue? What make us fear the client? the boss? a senior peer? or even a brat junior? The most important aspect is our ability communicate and put our point forward. Even if we are reasonably outspoken, fluent in the language you fear because you mostly loose the point. The person on the other hand (like facing lawyer) has some weird arguments which in most cases you are not prepared with answers - and right when you begin to loose - he(she) is right there to now put some decisions, actions and arguments right on the spot. You of course, don't get a chance to think about the answer and comeback and discuss. The matter is closed and pushed in your head! You kind of feel betrayed, lost, hurt and kind of giving up. For many having to eat non-sense from authority itself is insulting. I might sound very dramatic - but essential point is you fear and loose confidence because you have realize that you loose consistently against him/her and they misuse that fact. And more you surrender, more you loose the confidence, subsequently more often you surrender. It's a vicious circle! So what you do? 

seems cool. 4. Don't Hide Anything This is most important. Ultimately people either come to know - or people find things fishy. Good recruiters want to hire people who are upfront, even if you admit your mistakes. Own up and even confess - but promise that you won't continue this issue further. Explain them why! If that why is convincing you can be on good front. 

In a typical scenario, it shouldn't have been so bad. Bad luck truly. But i think the primary reason why you have been told no is that prospect project collapsed. I could have been a day before you join or a day after - that could have just been a co-incidence. However, this experience should tell us more of the following: 

That depends a lot on where do you see yourself in the future! The advise might just look contrary to what you asked for - but you are in what I call opportunity trap! It's opportunity because while there are many people who struggle for getting challenging work in organization you have got it! It can make you more indispensable and hence in a more powerful position than what you are currently. However, it is a trap - because failing here can seriously jeopardize current role as well as what can come in the future. Before you think about how to approach boss - be clearer in terms of what you want. Here are a few questions that you should ask yourself -who's answer might bring you clarity required. 

Appreciating people for spending their time with you is just a basic courtesy. When a school teacher gives student a failure grade - he is just doing his job! So it is not the end of the world. If VP has specifically asked you to meet - leave your baggage for the last interview aside and just go with an open mind just to listen to him. You might be there for a surprise or he might just want some other help. We are typically in a hyper-networked-world. So while a person X may or may not be able to hire in a company Y, he may still carry a positive view about you when he is around in some other company or even same company different context. 

And definitely, this is not an example for working under a good company or good leader. So how do you get out of this? Ideally, RV and MM should settle when and how this is going to stop. But it appears that RV is rather not bothered much or has some constraints. To understand this, understand why is this happening. So here is what you should do: 

Is the transition a good direction in the career or a bad one? From what appears you are being stretched between two different roles. Be the software engineering or otherwise - customer facing exercise is always a critical steps in the career evolution, but if you get tagged from one specialty to another - it is impediment in the career. Hence, you need to see what is useful. What is it you really dislike? Extra work, out-of-domain-work, lack-of-existing-expertise or facing the customer? Each of this has a solution. If you are hassled only because customer facing exercise are difficult you should share this with boss and ask for specific help on case by case. If you are uncomfortable because you didn't have prior knowledge seek for help in the subject matter -(though a smaller companies might have challenge here) but over time things get better. But most important if you are unhappy because you are getting digression in career towards undesirable field - you need to make it explicitly to the boss. Look for the future When you talk to boss - instead of cribbing or complaining - ask him about the future. Ask him whether you being originally software engineer is now going to be converted in some other role? Is this phase a temporary or does your boss thinks this is good forever? 

Usually in many meetings some designated person note down various points/minutes and send that note as an email to all participants. However, overtime i find that emails become too much of a pile of information. It becomes difficult to track the meetings and specially followup the meetings on the same subject. What are some best tools and practices for collecting and managing minutes of meeting? How do you organize it and make it accessible to the team (and yourself) for future reference? 

Have Faith No I didn't mean have faith that the person will become competent automatically. Have faith that over time people will realize what is wrong and who is wasteful resource in the larger picture. The symptoms you showed are applicable to both nepotism as well as for under performing populists (many of them are definitely the cardinal-nephews). 

The boss might really appreciate your intelligence and it will certainly help him cut his target time. No right minded boss will dislike the fact that subordinate did have a better idea. The boss might also be aware of that approach, but just choose not to take the short-cut! The decision behind why he asked you to take specific approach that takes 2 weeks - rather than something that will take 2 days might be for reasons he knows. So if you go back to him with wasting 2 weeks later only to give him the work based on alternative approach and that approach has a problem from the point of view of your boss - you have created a trouble for everyone! Above all, communicating and showing your approach (rather than sticking to either old approach or waste 2 weeks but take new approach) will work both help improve your credential as well as confidence in your boss about you. On the other hand, if your boss doesn't like your solution, you will still learn why he wants it certain way. 

MM - in spite of giving all the extra work, might still have no role or negative role to play when you are in the context of your appraisals. Lingering this situation more - you will be in worse situation than when you were only under MM. If both MM and RV begins to push work in full force, eventually you may not be either be able to deliver or at least not be able to prioritise. 

It is not that people don't know who are the suckers! It is just that these people are protected. Whenever crises occur, people mostly know whom to turn to; that's where you can pinch anyone and they will listen to you without choice. Of course, in organizations where appraisals and promotions are not truly performance based, probably there is no other solution than you getting your own influence before you can fight. Till then, wishing you luck! 

Treat him at the level of customer. Like bosses, most customers also tend to be less technical as well; and at times, even if they have some background, they might want to avoid technicality. Every communication thus needs a little more perspective and details from overall view. In a way start from a 50,000 feet view and add detail as you go down - till the point he is sufficiently happy to know. So in all this is a problem of structured communication. This structured communication implies: 

In all conversations - be open to view points of others and be assertive for yourself. All of the above is common for all people - employees, third-parties or interns. The biggest issue as far as you are concerned that being an intern - step 3 might have limitations. So it would be best that you let them choose the mode of reward - but be assertive about what you think you deserve. 

In my experience of over a decade in the industry i still find that getting real feedback is still not a regular thing. There are multiple things at play here. But there are things you can do. 1. Onus is on you tell me that getting explicit feedback is more of trying to find yourself and figure out based on action rather than people coming back to you with explicit good/bad (let alone quantitative) and from that, figuring out what was due to your contribution is probably even harder. But as a general rule in one's career, the onus to get feedback is on us then on the customer or management might be coming down. 2. The good/bad balance Good feedback comes very less. Bad ones almost always. How often have you had tasted a great new dish in the restaurant and rush to the kitchen to appriciate the chef? Against this, how often you had a service complain and yelled back to the call center? You will realize, that typical customers are like Unix commands; when everything is fine usually there is no feedback. When things go wrong you will see a surprise bomb on a Good Monday morning. So in a way, when explicit feedback hasn't come to you, you can actually be a bit relaxed that you never did a big enough goof up that someone will bother you with. 3. Your level in hierarchy matters Not getting feedback also sometimes means that your higher ups have taken up responsibility of it. In that case, talking to higher up or having open communication repo helps. When you will move up the ladder - most errors will be owned by you and you will see more direct view of it. Many comapanies, don't count lower hierarchy people share feedback thinking that it will unnecessarily move them. 4. Transparency is what changes signal to noise ratio Many organizations has fat layers across which one cannot see. There is clear hierarchy laid out for responsibility laid out. But things needs to travel only on pre-defined paths. So good or bad, if you are not higher up in the ladder or relevant function of company - you don't need feedback and you don't get feedback. Most often asking customers or sales guys directly might be best best -but it could be a bad gesture or a complete taboo in many organisations. Actually, in a startup like companies you can always openly discuss the matters. But that also depends on your initiative to ask more relevant people. In all regards, it is the habit to ask (harmlessly) will give you some feedback. 5. Quantification needs systems In many companies, systems are inherently geared up on processes and quantification. When your core processes or systems are more tacit by nature it is difficult, costly and sometimes quite artificial to generate this information from this. As Yannis pointed out, when there are no measurements in the system to start with, asking for quantified measure might be pointless; but if your organization is open in communication, seeking explicit feedback is more of the tacit form and you can seek that from people who you trust. What is important is to get to know first what was the overall fate of the project? What elements were good or gave problems, and did we do well for time and budgets. This are sometimes easy to answer but difficult to measure. 6. Feedback against expectations Sometimes what we really care about is how much of our work is aligned to the purpose of the larger objective or not. It is different from knowing whether we are doing a good job or not. I know of cases where a young guy works out of his way and what he thinks a homerun, ideally should have been done much more systematically by more or senior people. The point is, there is a difference between (self) appraisal [how well you could do against your caliber] and end user feed back [whether customer had any help from this work]. Both this things match only when your profile is perfect fit against customer expectations on your job. This looks obvious, but rarely true in real life. 7. Understand the bigger picture Quite often, people take things granted when they see things obvious. You will see many peculiar departments don't receive value because they don't participate (or are not allowed to participate) strategically. Admin guys, IT guys, even HR guys sometimes stand by the wayside and people keep watching the finance and sales guys taking up the center stage. It is not that company will not work without them, but it is not the core business of the company. In my opinion great many people should outsource stuff - but that is not always true. The same function could be very valuable in other companies. So if you part of that dock, you won't expect much feedback for yourself. If you take up career where your function becomes the core department (or controlling one) you will see lots of feedback even if you didn't ask for it. 8. Everyone is busy The higher ups are always busy. Either they are busy fighting lot of pressures to meet demands or they are busy dreaming and expanding. Only organization who is not extreme hungry on growth but still do great job in holding existing customer well, actually have a real channel of feedback after relationship evolves a great time. More often than not when we see customer walking out suddenly is a sign that no one really bothered to understand their problems. It is when strategic functions of business are jumping in the focus, real feedback doens't come to business itself, let alone the last curious guy! Sorry, if this was too long -but i think this is a real challenge in most places i have seen.
