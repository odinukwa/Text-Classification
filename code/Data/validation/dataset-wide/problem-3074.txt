1/ the fragmented and disunited nature of china of the time. The ability for the Mongols to fighting only part of china and acquire Chinese allies was absolutely crucial for the mongol conquest. without this the Mongols would not have succeeded. this is a key factor in mongol success that is often overlooked. against a strong unified China the Mongols would not have been successful. 2/ strong unified politics leadership. (contrast with the Chinese) the Mongol empire quickly started to decay once the unified leadership fell away. politically the organisation and structure was not up to a enduring empire. 3/ discipline/organisation this whats sets the Mongols apart from other horse nomads. militarily in tactics they was no real difference to the mongols and other horse nomads, they ran the same basic playbook, just with better leadership, discipline and organisation (which were often quite poor in horse nomads) 

What motivated the Kings of pagan tribes to move to Christianity? Christianity was more compatible with Hierarchy and structures the relatively unlimited power of divine right kings rather than the relativity more democratic or meritocratic pagan traditions. The medieval church was a good ally of Kings. A certain congruence of values between Kings and Bishops. The adoption of Christianity by Germanic tribes was an event driven by the Political leadership. Thus the answer lies in what advantages did Christianity have over paganism for this leadership? This at a time when the leadership of these tribes is pushing towards a more centralized and powerful Kingship, Christianity (as the early medieval church) was more compatible and more philosophically inclined to support the more centralized King's power than paganism.

Part of the Answer is that the French adopted 'fabain' tactics to some degree and generally stopped seeking to give battle to English forces, they dogged and harassed, but avoided major battles. The English forces of occasions marched from across France (Calais to Bordeaux). I only recently read Jonathon Sumption "Divided Houses : The Hundred Years War III" and definitely true for the period covered by this book, but my general knowledge of the war and period is not great. 

Germany was not held solely responsible for the War. The Treaty of Versailles only covered Germany, each of the other treaties with the various Central powers also contained a "war guilt" clause. In part the War Guilt clause was included on legal advice to put the reparations payments on the legal footing. 

Short Answer High Wages. The replacing of labour by machines was profitable in England, but often not so elsewhere with lower wages. 

There were definite rules that said Jewish ww1 "front line" veterans were entitled to better treatment just read Victor Klemperer's Dairy ("I shall bear witness") he had quite some difficulty in getting the approbate documentation of his ww1 service, (I can't remember if actually got it in the end) The Nazified bearucracy was not going to be of great assistance to Jews generally. 

On the eastern front the troops where deployed over a much larger area, which meant the density of troops was lower. The lower density of railway lines meant that the troops can not be switched as easily or always as close to any attack as they were in the west, where the much easier lateral communications mean that any sector that was seriously in danger could be quickly reinforced, ts was not always the case in the east. 

The Horror of another large scale war. Many believed that another large war would be much more horrific than ww1. There was a belief that "the bomber always gets through" it was thought that in any major conflict there would be many many civilian casualties even to the victors. The German propaganda about the strength of the Luftwaffe was believed, and the British air defences were not regarded as being up to scratch. 

as all battles in the period were decided by one side giving way and giving up the fight by running or fleeing, the men were not robots and morale was a very important factor and it soldiers failing to be steady and press forward or whole ground was a regular occurrence casualties in battle were often not particularly huge, the volleys often rapidly obscured vision, (musket gunpowder produced lot of smoke) the hit rate with muskets was ridiculously low in general, whole range of factors, such levelling not readily understood by many. these were confusing battlefields, noise and smoke. the superior morale in the ability of the troops to remain steady under fire was a crucial factor. the principal factor in troop quality rather than the skills in shooting and fighting. the British did not use conscription, and generally their troops were better paid. However the enlistments tended be those with few other choices. the Scots, Irish and kings German subjects were often very large parts of the British army. "For much of the 18th century, the army was recruited in a wide variety of places, and many of its recruits were mercenaries from continental Europe, including Danes, Hessians and Hanoverians.[3] These mercenaries were hired out by other rulers on contracted terms. Other regiments were formed of volunteers such as French Huguenots. By 1709, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the British Army totalled 150,000 men, of whom 81,000 were foreign mercenaries" $URL$ pre revolutionary France from what I can research did not use conscription either (for regular units in peace time) but when short or wartime unofficial impressment rather than conscription was used. $URL$ "The French royal army of the 17th and 18th centuries had consisted primarily of long-service regulars together with a number of regiments recruited from foreign mercenaries. Limited conscription for local militia units was widely resented and only enforced in times of emergency." $URL$ 

Performance on the battlefield is often about tactical organisation and method, rather than equipment and individual skill. Musketry was on the whole massively ineffective. Prussia had better tactical organisation during the Frederick the Great Period, but relatively short lived, The French were generally better after that. I know Napoleonic period is little after the 18th but Nosworthy is a good back about tactical doctrine and effectiveness of musketry. $URL$ Makes the argument that British fire doctrine of with holding fire until the enemy were a point blank (on attack or defence) made it much more effective (both in casualties and moral) That and better awareness of "levelling" (how high to aim ratline to distance from the target) than individual skill of the British with the musket. 

During the Napoleonic period cossacks were generally not regarded as "battle cavalry" and rarely did much on the battlefield. Though is rough hierarchy of cavalry weight hussars, dragoons, cuirassier, there are many examples of lighter cavalry overthrowing heavier cavalry. However there is vast range of other tasks required of cavalry in addition to performing on the battlefield. Scouting, pursuit, outposts, guarding prisoners, police functions in rear areas. The cossacks were used predominately in these functions, and with greater endurance, light supply needs ideal for many of these functions. While poor in massed charges they were adapt as small skirmishers particularly in rougher ground the regular cavalry could struggle. Russian cossacks intros period took most of this workload off the regular Russian cavalry which meant they would be conserved and fresher for battle. Their raiding in 1812/13 greatly added to the french difficulties in supply , movement and rear areas with greater escorts needed. Small detachments of regular cavalry and horse artillery were attached to the cossack flying columnist give them a bit of punch. Cossacks were also available in large numbers, and were relatively cheap to raise. Guard cossacks were different and had a good battlefield record. 

The battle of Borodino had a very high concentration of artillery and both sides did keep a lot of their reserves within artillery range and suffered large losses while held in reserve, the Russians troop much more so. Such large numbers of artillery and the reserves being kept so forward was unusual. And as the day went on the French re-deployed much of their artillery close to the Russian lines. "indeed, Clausewitz too complained about Toll's dispositions being so narrow and deep that needless losses were incurred from artillery fire." $URL$ Large losses in Russian units waiting n Reserve is just a well known fact about the battle. 

The Allied forces had more or less developed a pretty successful system of attacking by the end of the war. It did rely on having greater material resources than the Germans. Constant pressure and a large number of well resourced "bite and hold" attacks. This concentrated of wearing down the German army in a pretty brutal war of attrition. Each attack was limited, kept in range of the supporting guns, the objective was not to breakthrough but break in. Given the limitation and problems 'exploiting' or attempted 'breakthrough' , Allied strategy was not aimed at these. (the problems just could not be solved). The quick succession of bite and hold attacks would eventually wear down the German reserves, and them there would be some sort of breakthrough. 

Communications/Logistics. Eastern Europe was pretty undeveloped with poor local infrastructure to support armies or any great wealth to attract conquerers. Pushing out from Europe across the steppes just isn't attractive and is difficult. The mongols or other horse nomads are able to cross the area more easily, moving quicker and able too graze their horses. I dont agree that asian steppe armies "dominated". Difficult armies to fight but steppe armies never made that big a inroads, the Mongols nibbled the edges, defeating two of the smaller kingdoms in a couple of battles, the Huns get a way in but only controlled a small area of civilised Europe at the time for a short period. Horse nomad armies are hard to 'force' to fight not having a logistical base to defend, generally can pick and chose win to fight being much more strategically mobile generally. (though they need large grasslands to support their horses, and it takes lot of hours out of the day to graze horses, so they might be very quick in the short term, but slower over a longer term) So generally they withdraw rather that be defeated. Horse Nomad armies are a different military paradigm from civilised armies and generally the civilised armies are poorly adapted for fighting them. They can 'appear' quickly, moving quickly causing a lot of confusion, as armies used to vastly different opponents fail to adjust. A couple of battles in the crusades the turkish horse archer armies were smashed by european Knights failing to adjust themselves, it's not certainly that the nomad horse archer army just wins. The Mongols had superior élan, discipline and organisation compared to your average horse nomad army. 

1/ Hitler wanted to invade the soviet union and he was not a think things through throughly and take his time sort of guy,he lacked patience 2/he underestimated the difficulties in invading the soviet union and he believed the whole rotten structure would collapse. 3/Nazi Germany, it's Government, the army were run by 'yes men' no one was really going to bring Hitler up short with cold hard facts. 4/ it would not have worked. why? Logistics. It's a very long way to the Oil, it's very hard to get to and get it back somewhere useful. there was not enough naval resources to do it by sea, the royal navy from a vast number of suitable bases would easily interdict any such attempt. the railways did not exists and it would take years to build the railways. only a very very small force could be supplied entirely by road and not that far, the germans were incapable of projecting a large military force into the middle east and logistically supplying it. 

scythed chariots were expendable charge the opposing formations and the driver dives off the back, one shot weapons the hopefully broke up the enemy formations for other troops. not a good track record. mithridatic Pontic, later achaemenid persian were etc only notable users that spring to mind, late roman empire there was some experiments but I don't think they were ever fielded. 

I wouldn't say the Royal navy has 'so few' they had a very large number, it just turned out they could have done with quite a lot more. The main reason they felt themselves so short of destroyers is they underestimated the submarine/u boat threat and the need for convoy escorts. There was limited Royal Navy investigation of submarine and anti-submarine warfare in the interwar period, they really should have developed some of the anti submarine weapons and methods during the interwar period. The dismissing of the the need to convoy merchant vessels was fairly blind in the light of WW1 experience 

Because feudalism is just simple. It's basically rule armed thugs you pay so other armed thugs don't pick on you, often in barter. All you need for the rise of a feudal society is the breakdown of central authority and widespread violence and the rise of hereditary warrior class. 

Extremely rough approximates guestimates Ancient times 1%. Industrial 10% Industrial-Crisis maximum - 20% 20% is around ALL the military age males. Ancient period that gives 1 military age male in 20. 

Rural workers at one point lived with the framer and ate at his table, food & lodgings being a large part of the wage. There was a shift to just money wages, and a bit class difference that farmers no longer would eat with their labourers. So originally the workers received payment in kind that included meat and later they had to buy the meat. 

Fundamentally the major Mongol success was the conquest of China, and that was due to fact China was divided and Mongols were successful in getting large amounts of assistance by allying with Chinese factions. 

Most of the Christian population were fairly non-militarised during the crusader period. SO generally they did not participate in military affairs. Exceptions being the Armenians and Maronites. Various Armenian Christians were allied withe the crusaders, the county of Edessa was some sort of mixed state, with a lot of intermarriage with the locals and crusaders. The Maronites (Christians in what today is Lebanon) did ally themselves with the crusaders. 

Wages. Labour was too cheap for an Industrial revolution. Early industrialisation must be profitable in order to be widely adopted and sustainable. With cheap labour the replacement of human labour with machines just isn't profitable. Research and development of early machines is expensive and slow, if there is no pay off, (trey making of money but cheaper machines replacing more expensive labour) this process simply will not start. 

Fairly early in the war techniques and tactics were developed that meant trench systems could be successfully assaulted and many offensives were initially successful. They relied on large amounts of artillery support. While machine guns, trenches, the wire made attacking difficult, sufficient prepared assaults were generally successful. The Problems of successful exploiting a successful assault were vast. The Lack of communications over no mans land to the successful troops prevented accurate knowledge of their positions and what was happening, and without that knowledge is was hard to provide artillery support, or know when to reinforce or resupply. On top of that the range of most of the artillery meant that once advanced significantly the attacking troops were outside the range of supporting guns, (and even when in range lack of reliable observation of targets made it less effective) Bringing supplies, reinforcement and artillery over no man's land up to support, consolidate and attack further was very hard. The land was generally very churned up and often in range of enemy guns. Conversely the defender,he normally had much better information about the attacking troops location, the attacking troops and it's supply line was definitely in range of the defenders guns, the defenders communications generally were intact (buried wires), and his reinforcements could arrive along railways or roads quickly from other areas. Allied successful tactics, normally involved 'bite and hold' or similar, purposefully shallow attacks to keep the attackers in range of supporting artillery. 

France seems to hung on to the tradition longer than other places. It was still occurring in France with regularity before ww1. Perhaps it the slaughter of ww1 brought about the sharp decline after the war. Georges Clemenceau french leader during war fought duels 1892,duelled the author and Boulangist Paul Déroulède with pistols. $URL$ The last duel in France took place in 1967 when Gaston Defferre insulted René Ribière (fr) at the French parliament and was subsequently challenged to a duel fought with swords. $URL$ February 1897: Marcel Proust fought journalist Jean Lorrain, after Lorrain published an excoriating review of Proust's first book "Pleasures and Days" and hinted that Proust was having an affair with Madame Alphonse Daudet's son, Lucien.
