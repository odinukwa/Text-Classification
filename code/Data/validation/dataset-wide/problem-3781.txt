This is an expansion of Anton Petrunin's comment. Let me describe how to perturb the standard metric of the plane so that the resulting metric is bi-Lipschitz to the original with Lipschitz constant arbitrarily close to 1 and has arbitrarily small injectivity radius. Locate the plane in $\mathbb R^3$ as the $xy$-plane. Remove the unit disc centered at 0. Pick a point $(0,0,\delta)\in\mathbb R^3$ slightly above the origin and connect it by segments with the points of the boundary circle of the removed disc. This gives you a singular surface consisting of a planar part and a conical part. On the cone, there are arbitrarily short geodesic digons near the apex. Fix such a digon of small length $\rho>0$ and smoothen the surface in a so small neighborhood of the apex that it does not reach the digon. Also smoothen the surface near the circle. Now we have a smooth surface with injectivity radius $\le\rho$ because the geodesic digon is still there. The projection of this surface to the plane is a bi-Lipschitz diffeomorphism with bi-Lipschitz constant $C=\sqrt{1+\delta^2}$. This map sends the surface's metric to a new Riemannian metric on the plane, and it is $C$-bi-Lipschitz to the original one. To construct a metric with zero injectivity radius, just repeat this construction in a countable collection of disjoint discs $B_i\subset\mathbb R^2$, $i=1,2,\dots$, using the parameter $\rho=\rho_i\to 0$. 

I assume that "geometric predicate" is a logical formula involving known number of points, segments, etc, built from elementary predicates of Euclidean geometry ("this point lies on this line", "these two angles are equal" and the like) using boolean logic and quantifiers. Then there is an algorithm that reads the text of this logical formula and coordinates and radii of the circles (assuming they are finite decimal numbers, or otherwise "exact") from its standard input, consumes extraordinary amount of memory and CPU cycles, but finally answers whether a solution (or many solutions) exist, and if yes, prints one of them with a given precision. This works by translating the geometric question into a question about real numbers (coordinates) and using some algorithm implementing Tarski's theorem. Probably the program will run too long for all but very short formulas. Of course, there may be more efficient algorithms for some specific problems of this type. Or someone may invent better general algorithm in the future. 

Yes. Let $A$ be the set in question. We may assume that $0\notin A$ and moreover that $A$ is outside the unit ball centered at the origin. Since $A$ is closed (in a complete space) and not compact, it contains an infinite set $\{p_i\}_{i\in\mathbb N}$ of points whose radial projections to the unit sphere are $\varepsilon$-separated for some $\varepsilon>0$. For each $i$, consider a ray $R_i=\{tp_i:t\ge 1\}$. These rays are also $\varepsilon$-separated away from one another. Let $U_i$ denote the $(\varepsilon/3)$-neighborhood of $R_i$. It is easy to construct a homeomorphism $f_i:U_i\to U_i$ which maps $p_i$ to $i\cdot p_i$ and is the identity away from the $(\varepsilon/5)$-neighborhood of $R_i$. The union of these maps $f_i$ and the identity map of $C\setminus \bigcup U_i$ is a homeomorphism from $C$ to itself that sends $A$ to an unbounded set. 

Define $P:F\times F$ by $P(x,y) = xD(y)-yD(x)$. From the above identities it is easy to see that $P$ is additive in each argument and satisfies $P(tx,ty)=t^2 P(x,y)$ for all $x,y,t\in F$. Finally, define a "scalar product" on $F^2$ by $$ \langle (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2) \rangle = P(x_1,y_2) + P(x_2,y_1) . $$ It satisfies all the desired properties but is not bilinear: if $u=(1,0)$ and $v=(0,1)$, then $\langle u,v\rangle=0$ but $\langle u,\pi v\rangle=1$. Update. One can check that if $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ is a "mock scalar product" as in the theorem, then for any two vectors $u,v$, the map $t\mapsto \langle u,tv\rangle - t\langle u,v\rangle$ must be a differentiation of the base field. (A differentiation is map $D:F\to F$ satisfying the above rules for sums and products.) Thus mock scalar products on $\mathbb R^2$ are actually classified by differentiations of $\mathbb R$. And non-trivial differentiations of $\mathbb R$ do exist. In fact, a differentiation can be extended from a subfield to any ambient field (of characteristic 0). Indeed, by Zorn's Lemma it suffices to extend a differentiation $D$ from a field $F$ to a one-step extension $F(\alpha)$ of $F$. If $\alpha$ is transcedental over $F$, one can define $D(\alpha)$ arbitrarily and extend $D$ to $F(\alpha)$ by rules of differentiation. And if $\alpha$ is algebraic, differentiating the identity $p(\alpha)=0$, where $p$ is a minimal polynomial for $\alpha$, yields a uniquely defined value $D(\alpha)\in F(\alpha)$, and then $D$ extends to $F(\alpha)$. The extensions are consistent because all identities involved can be realized in the field of differentiable functions on $\mathbb R$, where differentiation rules are consistent. Thus there exists a mock scalar product on $\mathbb R^2$ such that $\langle e_1,e_2\rangle=0$ but $\langle e_1,\pi e_2\rangle=1$. And I am sure I reinvented the wheel here - all this should be well-known to algebraists. 

There is a counter-example. Note that in any normed space, its unit ball satisfies your supremum-attaining property. Indeed, for any $x_0\in X$ the supremum of $d(x_0,\cdot)$ on the ball is attained at the point $-x_0/\|x_0\|$ if $x_0\ne 0$, and at any point of the sphere if $x_0=0$. It remains to construct a Banach space whose unit ball has no extreme points. Let $X$ be the space of all sequences $(x_i)_{i=1}^\infty$ such that $x_i\to 0$ as $i\to\infty$, equipped with the $\ell_\infty$ norm $\|x\|=\sup|x_i|$. It is a closed subspace of $\ell_\infty$ and hence complete. But clearly its unit ball has no extreme points. 

I can complete Anton's plan with an additional assumption that geodesics do not branch. I also assume local compactness (otherwise there are too many technical details to deal with). More precisely, I prove the following: Let $X$ be a geodesic space. Suppose that 

The answer is yes. Moreover you don't need to assume that $B$ is nonpostively curved. (And, if you are not interested in the equality case or can afford a convex boundary, the nonpositive curvature of $A$ can be replaced by a weaker assumption that the geodesics in $A$ have no conjugate points). This follows from a filling inequality that I have proved some time ago (and quite proud of it) and boundary rigidity results of Croke, Otal, or Pestov-Uhlmann. Inequality. There are two papers covering it: 1) S.Ivanov, On two-dimensional minimal fillings. Algebra i Analiz 13 (2001), no. 1, 26-38 (Russian); English translation in St. Petersburg Math. J., 13 (2002), no.1, 17-25. A preprint is here. In this paper the inequality $area(A)\le area(B)$ is proved under the assumptions that $A$ is free of conjugate points and has convex boundary (sorry;)) and for arbitrary $B$ such that $d_A(p,q)\le d_B(p,q)$ for all $p,q$ on the boundary. 2) S.Ivanov, Filling minimality of Finslerian 2-discs. arXiv:0910.2257, to appear in Trudy Mat. Inst. Steklov (= Proc. Steklov Inst. Math). In this paper the same thing is proved for Finslerian metrics $A$ and $B$ and without convex boundary assumptins. This is the maximum generality I can imagine. But the paper is harder to digest if you don't like Finsler metrics. The equality of areas implies that the boundary distances of $A$ and $B$ coincide, and then you can apply boundary rigidity results mentioned below. Rigidity. The case you are asking for is covered by C.Croke, Rigidity for surfaces of nonpositive curvature, Comment. Math. Helv. 65 (1990), no. 1, 150–169. He proves that if $A$ is a nonpositively curved and $B$ is arbitrary Riemannian such that $d_A(p,q)=d_B(p,q)$ for all $p,q$ on the boundary, then $A$ and $B$ are isometric. He carefully works through the details of non-convex boundaries. I have not read J.-P. Otal's paper mentioned by Igor Rivin, but from mathscinet review it seems that he assumes that both $A$ and $B$ are strictly negatively curved. For the same result without curvature assumptions but with convex boundary, see L.Pestov and G.Uhlmann, Two dimensional compact simple Riemannian manifolds are boundary distance rigid. Ann. of Math. (2) 161 (2005), no. 2, 1093–1110. 

Let $X$ be a negatively curved symmetric space. In other words, $X$ is one of the four examples: a hyperbolic space, a complex hyperbolic space, a quaternionic hyperbolic space or the hyperbolic Cayley plane. Let $B\subset X$ be a compact set (wlog, a large ball). Does there always exist a subgroup $\Gamma$ of the isometry group of $X$ such that $X/\Gamma$ is a compact manifold and the images of $B$ under $\Gamma$ are disjoint (i.e. $B\cap\gamma B=\emptyset$ for every nontrivial $\gamma\in\Gamma$)? Remark: It would suffice to find just one (for each $X$) residually finite discrete co-compact group of isometries. I am sure there is one but I don't know where to look. (Or maybe they all are residually finite?) Meta-proof: If the answer is negative, then, for some of the model geometries (in some dimension), all compact manifolds with this local geometry are "uniformly thin" - all injectivity radii are bounded above by some universal constant. Such a wonderful fact would be widely known. 

Then $X$ is isometric to $\mathbb R^n$ for some $n$. Proof. First observe that the group of similarities acts transitively on pairs (oriented line, point not on this line). Indeed, given two such pairs $(\ell_1,p_1)$ and $(\ell_2,p_2)$, it suffices to find similar triples $p_1,x_1,y_1$ and $p_2,x_2,y_2$ where $x_i,y_i$ is a positively oriented pair of points on $\ell_i$. And it is easy to see that such triples $p_i,x_i,y_i$ realise all similarity types of, e.g. isosceles triangles. Next we construct perpendiculars. Lines $\alpha$ and $\beta$ intersecting at a point $q$ are said to be perpendicular if there exists an isometry that fixes $\alpha$ and maps $\beta$ to itself by reflection in $q$. It is easy to see that this relation is symmetric. Further, for every line $\ell$ and every point $p\notin\ell$ there exists a unique perpendicular to $\ell$ containing $p$. To prove existence, pick two points $x,y\in\ell$ such that $|px|=|py|$. There is an isometry that fixes $p$ and exchanges $x$ and $y$. It acts on $\ell$ by reflection in the midpoint $q$ of $[xy]$, hence the line $(pq)$ is perpendicular to $\ell$. Uniqueness follows from the fact that two distinct reflections of $\ell$ cannot fix $p$, otherwise their composition shifts $\ell$ along itself and fixes $p$, and some iteration of this shift would break the triangle inequality. This argument also shows that the base $q$ of the perpendicular is the nearest point to $p$ on $\ell$, and the distance from $p$ to $x\in\ell$ grows monotonically with $|qx|$. Clearly all right-angled triangles with given leg lengths $a$ and $b$ are isometric; denote their hypotenuse by $f(a,b)$. Then $f$ is strictly monotone in each argument and positively homogeneous: $f(ta,tb)=tf(a,b)$. Next, we show that the sum of Busemann function of two opposite rays is zero. Or, equivalently, if $\gamma$ is an arc-length parametrized line, $q=\gamma(0)$ and a line $(pq)$ is perpendicular to $\gamma$, then $B_\gamma(p)=0$ where $B_\gamma$ denotes the Busemann function of $\gamma$. Suppose the contrary. We may assume that $|pq|=1$ and $B_\gamma(p)=c>0$. This means that for every point $x\in\gamma$ we have $|px|-|qx|\ge c$. Let $s\in\ell$ be very far away and let $p_1$ be the perpendicular from $q$ to $(ps)$. The above inequality implies that $|pp_1|\ge c$, hence we have an upper bound $|qp_1|\le\lambda<1$ where $\lambda$ is determined by $f$ and $c$ and does not depend on $s$. Let $q_1$ be the base of the perpendicular from $p_1$ to $(qs)$, then rescaling the above inequality yields that $|p_1q_1|\le\lambda|qp_1|\le\lambda^2$. The next perpendicular (from $q_1$ to $p_2$ on $(ps)$) has length at most $\lambda^3$ and so on. Summing up these perpendiculars, we see that $|ps|\le 1/(1-\lambda)$ which is not that far away, a contradiction. The fact that opposite rays yield opposite Busemann functions implies that the Busemann function of a line $\gamma$ is the only 1-Lipschitz function $f$ such that $f(\gamma(t))=-t$ for all $t$. And, given local compactness and non-branching of geodesics, this implies that $X$ is split into lines parallel to $\ell$, where a line $\gamma_1$ is said to be parallel to $\gamma$ if the Busemann function of $\ell$ decays with unit rate along $\gamma_1$ (to construct a parallel line, just glue together two opposite asymptotic rays). Further, Busemann functions of parallel lines coincide, due to their above mentioned uniqueness. Now it is easy to see that the level set of a Busemann function (which is also a union of perpendiculars to a given line at a given point) has the same isometry extension property and is a geodesic space. Then we can carry induction in the parameter $d$ defined as the maximum number of pairwise perpendicular lines that can go through one point. The cases $d=1$ and $d=2$ can be done by hand, then use isometries exchanging perpendicular lines to do the induction step. 

The following extension of Keivan Karai's comment proves the result. Consider $q(x):=p(x)-c$ where $c=\frac12 \min p([0,1])$. Approximate $q(x)$ as Keivan suggested: let $$ q_n(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n q(i/n) \binom ni x^i(1-x)^{n-i} . $$ Then $q_n$ is a polynomial of at most the same degree as $q$ (and hence $p$) and $q_n$ converges to $q$ uniformly on $[0,1]$. Since the degree is bounded, it follows that the coefficients of $Q_n$ converge to the coefficients of $q$. In particular, $\deg q_n=\deg q$ for all large enough $n$. Let $a$ be the leading coefficient of $q$ and $a_n$ the leading coefficient of $q_n$. Then $a_n\to a$ and hence the polynomial $$ r_n(x):=\frac a{a_n} q_n(x) $$ converges to $q(x)$ uniformly on $[0,1]$. Choose $n$ so large that $|r_n-q|<c$ on $[0,1]$, then $r_n<p$ on $[0,1]$. Since $r_n$ is already represented in the desired form, it remains to represent $p-r_n$. Observe that $\deg(p-r_n)<\deg p$ and proceed by induction. Appendix: Why $\deg q_n\le\deg q$. Since $q_n$ is linear in $q$, it suffices to consider the case $q(x)=x^k$. Let $$ F_0(u,v) = (u+v)^n = \sum_{i=0}^n \binom ni u^i v^{n-i} $$ and $$ F_m = u\cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial u} F_{m-1}, \qquad m=1,2,\dots $$ Then $$ F_k(u,v) = \sum_{i=0}^n i^k \binom in u^iv^{n-i}, $$ hence $q_n(x) = n^{-n} F_k(x,1-x)$. By induction in $k$ one sees that $F_k(u,v)$ is a linear combination of terms of the form $u^j(u+v)^{n-j}$ with $j\le k$. Hence $F_k(x,1-x)$ has degree at most $k$, and so does $q_n(x)$. Remark. Analyzing the coefficients of the above linear combination, one can see that, as $n\to\infty$ and $k$ fixed, the coefficient at $u^j(u+v)^{n-j}$ goes to 1 and all other ones go to 0. This gives an elementary proof of convergence $q_n\to q$ (coefficient-wise) avoiding the general theory.
