The studies measure agression by judging it on a persons agressive feelings, thoughts, associations and attitudes. But the report stat that the link between those things and a manifestation of agression is lacking empirical support. It's not clear from the research if the people would react in the same way when they are outside of a laboratory setting. The research fails to take in relevant background information and the studies show that the inclination to play violent video games and agressive behavior both depend on things like a bad family situation. 

There was a huge controversy towards sweden in 2009 when Aftonbladet one of our newspapers published that the israeli military had at some point been harvesting organs of dead palestinians. At the time I personally didn't believe Aftonbladets claims as virtually all Swedish newspapers are about as good as tabloids, and it sounded like something out of the Daily Mail. 21th of August 2009 the Local reports in Israel blasts Sweden over organ harvesting report calling for the Swedish government to condemn one of it's newspapers reports. Something which is nearly unthinkable in Sweden as the newspapers are completely separate entities: 

A French TV program (Stars sous hypnose) shows celebrities who are hypnotized by an (apparently) famous hypnotizer (Mesmer). They then proceed to do incredible things (believing to be vampires, forgetting the number 7, ...). This looks very much fake to me, as if they were acting. On the other hand, most comments I got from a few Google searches do not debunk this show, which is quite surprising when looking at the enormity of what these stars are doing. Were such actions actually scientifically measured/checked, under some reasonable conditions? (the definition of hypnosis is not that important, it can be any stated induced by someone in a typical TV environment - so no day-long dances which bring in some kind of trance, or drugs, or starvation, ...) Note: a similar question mentioned participants being or not staged - in my case the ones under hypnosis are well-know celebrities, some of them actors, some not. They all claim being genuinely hypnotized. 

This is actually pretty hard to research because of the huge pile of papers that has been touching this subject in one way or another, but also because of paywalls. I haven't found anything that directly answers your question, but I have found a lot of things about how pornographic consumption (possibly) influences our attitudes and behavior. Processes Underlying the Effects of Adolescentsâ€™ Use of Sexually Explicit Internet Material: The Role of Perceived Realism would be interesting to dig into if it wasn't paywalled: 

which would make it the week prior to November 26, 2011 where as the image in the article that is turning up on a tineye search as early as 2009 ($URL$ 

I am French so oenology is obviously a big thing here. I then read from time to time that it is, generally speaking, a scam - "scam" being defined in various ways: 

(again, emphasis is mine) There is an obvious contradiction between the journalist statements and Telegram. While the author of the article is not competent in the matter of encryption and how the messaging apps work, his mention of the specific case of the attack in Germany is worrisome. I could not find sources for his claims (and he does not cite any), only vague CNN or DW mentions of Telegram being used. Are there any precise information on how the Telegram information was acquired? 

Even if that's true, this is not case anymore the suicide act of 1961 decriminalizes suicide. However, did there use to be such a law? 

So there's no shortcut to figuring this one out. It's also incredibly hard to research, because there's a ton of noise (vampire bats have rabies, fan fiction and all kinds of stuff) and a lot of the papers are paywalled without conclusions in their abstracts. In a book titled The monster with a thousand faces: guises of the vampire in myth and literature the origins of the vampire myth is discussed. 

However you shouldn't assume that people who work in prisons are abusive, even going by accusation it's a low number of the total. A DOJ report from September 2009 reports that 4.7% of all staff members under the BOP (Federal Bureau of Prisons) has been accused of sexual assault, it doesn't however seem to break it down into categories containing the nature of the abuse. On the bright side I did find out that congress has attempted to do something about prison rape back in 2003: 

Background: Telegram is a secured messaging app, similar to many others (WhatsApp, Signal, ...). It emphasizes its security features and has become (like a few others) a way for people to exchange messages in a secured way. "People" can be good or bad, depending on personal interpretation. An article by Gordon Ryner in The Telegraph (27/03/2017) mentions that 

(emphasis and clarification mine) The article is generally poorly written (the author mixes up all kind of communication channels without understanding the differences), the quoted piece, however, suggests that Telegram is not as protective of the user data they control (= stored and encrypted by them, as opposed to secret chats) as advertized. Specifically, the FAQ for Telegram states that 

I've found one post that uses that image from as early as 2009-12-16 (not that it shows much of anything, but might be helpful) $URL$ the image is also all over image blogspam since that date. 

So there seem to be a strong correlation that it does not cause cancer as well as at least one high profile physicist claiming that the experimental results are showing that there is no effect on brain cancer from cell phones. 

I'm watching a documentary on National Geographic on a case where they were tracking down a gang trading in tigers in Thailand. It was claimed that tiger farms, who has the purpose of breeding tigers for trade drive up demand and further hurt the wild tiger population. Is there any basis for that? 

Since you mentioned Europe: at least in the EU you are to fill in an accident form (which is similar between countries but there isn't a fixed format) and at least in France this document does not discusses at all who was guilty and who wasn't. It is just a write-up of facts and the insurances will then handle it between themselves. What you are saying at the accident scene is irrelevant (except if there is police involved, and they will be if there are corporal damages). 

In other words, it is presented in a similar way to homeopathy. The concept of "good wine" seems to be very individual (I like wines which would be an abomination to others) and classification highly subjective (for lack of quantifiable reference) so I was wondering to what extend oenology is something more than a circle of reciprocal adoration and more like a quantifiable exercise. EDIT: I am not asking whether the concept exists (it does) or whether it is studied (it is). This does not make it a scientific (reproducible, measurable) activity where people objectively decide whether a wine is good or not. To take an analogy - painting is a completely subjective area. It is studied and people learn how to draw. This allows them to move from a stick figure to a realistic portrait. It does not mean that there is an objective classification of good and bad art, this is purely a biased decision of an individual or a group group with their own preferences. Oenology is seen as a "science", that is a place where you can objectively decide about the quality of a wine, by tasting it. The competition is not done with a chromatograph but with someone who takes a sip, looks at the wine and says "this one is better than this other one".
