The treasury can issue more bonds and the central bank buys it up, prints more currency and gives it to the government. This is called monetizing the deficit. Although this practice may be challenged by the central bank itself depending upon the situation. The treasury can sell new bonds to commercial banks and other financial institutions. Commercial banks use these to be kept as statutory reserve requirements with the central bank and also as safe assets because these are, of course, most highly rated securities. The demand could be more or less but there is always a demand for safe assets. Think of a countries like China and Japan which invest heavily in U.S treasury bonds and other assets. Theoretically speaking, government can finance any amount of deficits via the central bank route. Crowding out will happen when the government is borrowing huge loans from the commercial banks and dries up the sources of funds for the private investors. It also depends on the purpose and timing of the spending. Whether the government is spending on non-productive programs or productive programs which are in turn helping the overall health and investment environment of the nation and whether it is spending counter-cyclically or cyclically. Also, if there is an upward pressure on the interest rates due to possible crowding out, we can expect central bank to make necessary adjustments. Moreover, the mechanism is not so simple. It is complex as hell. The flow of savings in the economy is not fixed and hence the pressure may or may not build up. It largely depends on the investor sentiments and expectations also. 

A monopoly's pricing and production decisions are calculated this way: Equate the marginal cost and marginal revenue functions. This will give you the production quantity. Now, you plug in this quantity in the demand function to get the price. I don't think, MR is equated with average cost. 

Theoretically the capital account balance should fully offset the current account balance and the BoP should be zero for any economy. What causes the imbalance or discrepancy in the overall BoP ? What makes countries run BoP surplus or deficits ? 

I would agree with the first answer. Fungibility will essentially give market power to the existing players. A new player in a relatively inelastic goods market will have to offer something differentiated to snatch some share from existing players because it cannot take advantage of a low cost. This gives rise to problem as with 'fungibility' you cannot differentiate. One example is commodity products like soaps. It is difficult to differentiate and the inelastic demand leaves with you with lesser options. This gives way to attractive packaging, positioning etc to influence demand. That is why there is aggressive marketing in fast moving consumer goods market. 

An import quota in an open economy might not have the desired affect of increasing the GDP as it increases the demand of domestic currency in the open market raising exchange rate. How does it happen that import quota causes demand to shift positively ? 

Theoretically it is possible but only if the non profit organization operates at a cost which is lower than all other existing as well as expected new players as in a free market anybody with a much lower cost can enter and offer a price lower than the NPO and still earns a profit. And what about other NPOs in the same field. If they have a lower cost they will certainly offer a lower price. Secondly the NPO should accepted by the consumers. Practically speaking the market has many more complexities such as existence of brands and the information that price suggests. A lower price means lower quality which may not be accepted by the consumers. For example I may start manufacturing and selling mobile handsets at zero profit but still I might not drive Apple out of the market. Also, the world is not much perfect. To start I would have to install a capacity that can produce at a cost lower than the existing players and then offer a lower price to drive them out. But still you can have examples of apparent monopolies in markets say for example 'online information'. What do you think Wikimedia is ? It is an NPO. 

Yes selling of financial assets is indeed a borrowing. They are sold to finance the deficits in our own accounts. When in an economy there are more investments than savings, the economy needs to borrow from foreigners which is through through these financial assets. Investment + Capital Outflow = Savings + Capital Inflow This is in contrast to the closed economy situation wherein the only demand of capital in domestic investment and only supply is domestic savings. Here, the demand comes from foreigners as well through purchase of their assets. Same way supply can also come from foreigners via the selling of domestic assets. Whenever I > S, there must be a capital inflow. 

I was thrilled at seeing an interesting bidding system in an academic institutions. This bidding is for registration of courses. Each student is allocated some points based on her grade point(GPA). So, a student with higher GPA gets more points. Each course has a maximum strength of 60 students and a set of say 15 courses is offered. A student bids higher for the courses that she wants and feels will be oversubscribed. According to the literature in this subject, I know that this is not an incentive compatible mechanism as the students' bids are considered equivalent to their preferences but a student may bid more for a subject with less utility but which is has higher number of subscribers. Also, I feel that this is a kind of first price auction. Whatever bid I propose, it is consumed if I cross the minimum bid at which the subscription closes. Courses are different and students have different preferences. Each student would bid for any number of courses that she prefers and expects to go oversubscribed. Students' preferences over courses are on academic basis i.e. courses that are popular or taken by some famous faculty. So, student's objective is to get her favorite course. EDIT : In first round, the students give a list of 5 courses they wish to enroll in. In second round, bidding happens for the oversubscribed courses. So, if I entered course A in round 1 and it got oversubscribed, then in round 2 I will have to bid for it. After round 2, if I get the courses that I wanted then it's fine else I will have to choose some other course (for which seats are not completely filled) so that I have 5 courses. I am not being able to understand in intuitive terms how a student can behave wrong and hide her true preferences while bidding in such a mechanism. Please help point out some intuitive examples which violate the incentive compatibility. Thanks in advance. 

To give some more insight, the oil shock of 1973 was basically a situation of stagflation wherein economy slowed down and inflation rose simultaneously. Such a situation is rare but has happened and is better understood through supply side of macroeconomics. To be precise, the situation of 1973 was a complex one. Since, oil is an essential factor for all industries ,hence, the steep rise in oil prices made the real long term supply curve (which is vertical) shift to left. This phenomenon was not well understood at that time and the policy reacted in the typical Keynesian way i.e. to boost consumption by spending more but in reality they were overshooting the target which led to more inflation as economy was already running hot. 

There are two necessary conditions for such a price discrimination : 1. The markets should be isolated 2. Some sort of price making power should be involved i.e. some degree of imperfection is required. 

In my understanding you are studying about the balanced budget multiplier. When the government tries to boost GDP by increasing government expenditure (G) and by financing this expenditure by an equal increase in gross taxes collected (T). Yes, theoretically such a simultaneous increase in G and T will increase the GDP by an amount equal to the increase in G. The point to be understood is the functioning of multiplier in the economy. Economy works in a circular flow. Loosely speaking, the income of firms is equal to the consumption of the consumers. When G is increased it goes directly in the economy and gets added in GDP as in a closed economy GDP = C + I + G where C= Consumption by households and I = investment by firms. C depends on GDP and T itself which gives rise to the multiplier affect (taking I and G as independent of GDP) which implies an increase in GDP more than the increase in T. However, when government increases T, the multiplier effect is not as much strong as T is not a direct component of the GDP. It works by affecting C. You can easily understand the mathematics behind it once you look at any standard textbook.
