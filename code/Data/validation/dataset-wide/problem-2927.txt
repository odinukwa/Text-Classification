The following passage surprised me, not only because it has in place of , but also because it describes everything I see as a consequence of so-called "Postmodernism" (or whatever name you give it: post-structuralism, deconstructionism, moral relativism...): destruction of meaning, praise of fragmentation, anti-intellectualism... 

When did it begin? Before Schopenhauer, for sure, since he writes about this in his "The Art of Literature" ("A Arte de Escrever", in portuguese). He says that when somebody doesn't have anything to say, it's useful to hide this absence under obscure sentences. In the 20th century, this has become more common, and even widespread in what has been called "post-modernism". One of the basis of this movement is the attack of reason. Their justification is that reason enables technology, and modern technology is enslaving humankind. Beautiful, BUT: the industry will keep on using technology AND reason to enslave humankind, but humankind has everyday less reason to defend itself. What I think it's going on is: the Enlightenment, and the science and philosophy after it, have gradually reduced the power of religion to enslave humankind. Darwin gave the "mercy shot" in the monotheistic god, Marx developed a system where religion was abandoned, and humankind could at last (in theory) be free. Of course there would be a reaction. The power of the religious elite is big enough to put "thinkers" inside important universities, to publish their books, to make flattering reviews and so on. It seems to me it began with the so-called "Frankfurt school" (composed mostly of jews, a group that owns lots of things, from universities to newspapers and industries). Other points they repeatedly assert: "there is no truth", if there is no truth, than there is no lie, and the religions again can lie without anyone say they're lying. They also write a lot about "fragmentation", since a fragmented society is weak to defend itself against the powerful ones (be it the industry or the churches). But why use a cryptic style to convey such message? Because, in a rational society, their lies would be immediately unveiled. With their style, they can always answer "that's not what we said!" But there is more to their style: they mix cryptic passages with very clear ones - and the clear ones are of two kind: 1) the one that makes obvious claims, thus serving as an anchor to the reader's thinking ("oh, now I'm getting what he is saying...") and usually giving a left-wing sensation, what makes them popular in the "developing" world; 2) some subliminal passages where they spread their real values, i.e. putting theology and philosophy as "equal", and both above the natural sciences; accusing science of mistakes made by religion; saying that "the world is a human construct", that "the truth is inside each head"; etc. Part of it has been explained by Sokal in his famous "affair". But other critics have said similar things about other "thinkers", for instance, Derrida. Finally, if you should write in such style? Of course not! One who thinks clearly must write clearly. If one is on the side of the people, it should be able to communicate with the people. I suggest writing as clear as possible, like Bertolt Brecht, Schopenhauer, Noam Chomsky, Bertrand Russell, Mark Twain, Dostoievski and many others. 

It could be impossible. The number of neurons needed to understand themselves might be bigger than the actual number. Worse is that not all neurons are there to "understand". We could create machines with more neurons than us, but then THEY would understand, not us - turning us into probable slaves of our own machines (aren't we already? ;) Even if it's possible, is it desirable? What the worst consequences could be? It's impossible to predict, but is it possible to avoid? A "technologic singularity" is on the horizon, but I go with the taoist maxima of the "uncarved wood". There is no greater elegance than simplicity. The masses are far best served by a clean river than by any digital gadget. We need more Nature and less propaganda, not the opposite. So trying to build biggger and bigger and wiser and wiser machines is not at all a nice plan. We will end down the road being destroyed by them (aren't we already?). 

The Dao De Jing is a classic about how Nature operates (or doesn't operate) to achieve its ever-evolving marvels. here means a classic book. is the Way, the "first cause": to me a fancy name for Nature. In such naturalistic spirit, what are good translations for ? In most English translations, It appears as Virtue. But, as Nietzsche remembered, there are Virtues and virtues... (virtù: brave, heroic, strong, capable... and in the extreme opposite the virtues of submission, chastity, humbleness, humility - humiliation - mortification... somewhere in between, perhaps, the virtuous as sensible, simple, maybe stoic but not necessarily ruthless or even bellicose: the daoist 圣人 , usually translated as "sage" or "saint". But the Dao De Jing criticizes both the "knowledgeable" and the "flawless"). Virtue, sage, saint... words full of contradictory meanings ingrained as an old tan... In the "organic origin of the being" (DDJ 51) we read 

"by an elementary utilitarian calculus", you may do more harm than good in the medicine, mostly if you're not fully satisfied. Modern medicine is already criticized for being too much mercantilist ("curing" illness with the aid of expensive drugs full of bad side-effects), and too less about preventing diseases (the "high medicine" goal of old chinese medicine). Now, if a slight dissatisfaction would make you lean towards accepting or questioning the farmaceutical-industry-dominated-system, that's something hard to predict. Gandhi was a lawyer and managed to peacefully free 350 million indians from the British rule. Bertrand Russell was a mathematician and also a philosopher, who wrote great books that helped push a little further the now growing obscurantism. So my advice|answer would be: do what you like most, only in this way you'll have the energy to bring to the world the truth we need. 

I don't think so. When Chinese first discovered gunpowder, they used it for centuries only in the production of fireworks. Weapons needed skill to be used, and this alone probably avoided major violence. With fire guns, any stupid ass can kill a honourable master easily. Consider the number of murders is a formula such as n = k*p1*p2 being p1 the probability that someone wants to kill somebody else p2 the probability that the person in p1 finds a weapon lethal enough (i.e. that may be used with success) k some constant What your "argument" says is that only p1 matters. But of course the number of fire guns is directly related with p2, thus with the number of deaths. 

"What is the best rebuttal against (the philosophical mindset of) this exhibit?" The best rebuttal to me is that the Bible is a mythology that ignores the other mythologies of the world. And most other mythologies will easily agree with the discoveries of "modern science" about evolution (many already did way before Darwin). So, while Bible has a rigid mentality (typical of monotheisms), the other mythologies (polytheists) are more open and flexible, just like science. I have never seen a daoist or confucionist or hinduist deny darwinian evolution. In short: Bible don't need science to be disproven, it needs other mythologies. 

I've read some things from this guy, and I'm not sure he is really from the Left. There are a lot of guys (and girls) nowadays who are from the Right, but disguise as Left to reach their goals (like Derrida and many other "postmoderns", who, were they from the Left, their first concern would be to write clearly and be fully understood). So, if Zizek is really from the Right, this alone would explain his popularity within contemporary media. 

As @jo wehler put it, who said only one god made the job? Much more when it's said to be "on our image and likeness", that makes necessary at least a god-man and a god-woman, as there are in many other, less patriarchal, mythologies. You just can't prove it. Just like you can't prove idealism, or materialism, for that matter. That's why it's said that "proof" is an abstraction that only exists in three areas: math, law and monotheism. 

Can we define religion as "the mythologies that don't assume they are mythologies"? First, mythology is the oldest way of describing Nature. Polytheisms, extant or extinct, usually know|knew their mythologic nature. Thus the usually pacific and prolific relationships between many different polytheistic people (between many amerindian tribes, or between old indians and chinese, for instance). Since many gods exist in such mythologies, for "my gods" to exist it isn't necessary that "your gods" don't exist. Then monotheism comes to the picture. It claims to itself the status of "truth". For "my God", the "only god" to be correct, any other gods must be false. Isn't it a completely new concept? Isn't it a mythology, like any other, with the main difference of not accepting to be called like that? Doesn't it come wrapped in an unprecedented layer of lie (deny every other myth, except itself)? If so, how can we call all of them the same? A: call both "mythology", and monotheism/religion a subset of all existing mythologies. B: call both "religion", but polytheism/mythology a subset of all existing religions. Looks like the choice between A and B is entirely dependent of what you believe|think? Or is there a rational, concrete, least prone to doubt or attack, way of choosing? Since polytheistic mythologies are much older and geographically more widespread, to me sounds natural that some modern so-called religions derived from them, and not the opposite (as some believers have already tried to convince me). So, "religion" and "mythology" are synonyms? Or one is a subset of the other? If so, which is a subset of which? 

You will find definitions of "left" and "right" not only in the French Revolution, but also in the much older Dao De Jing (or Tao Te Ching). "Left" is on the side of the people. "Right" is on the side of the powerful. That's why those on the right side of the political spectrum usually deny/blur the distinction between left and right. In a "democratic" society, they can't assume that they are against the people. "On the gun control issue Republicans insist that people have right to bear arms; not the Democrats." The powerful usually prefer to kill a robber than to be robbed. Those who are on the side of the people usually believe that no diamond, or whatever, has more value than a human life. So, to save lives, the left chooses the smallest amount of guns possible. The powerful usually wanna save their money, they don't care about saving human lives (even more that of a robber! I mean, of someone who rob THEIR property). On gay rights, who are the gays bothering? They only wanna live and be happy. But church insisted, millenia ago, that being gay is "wrong". Since the church is responsible for defending the status quo, the powerful will defend the church, so they are against gays. The left are closer to understand that the church is wrong in this aspect. And, being on the side of the people, they wonder even why is the church so powerful? "on the issue of abortion Republicans favour life, but on the issue of death penalty the Democrats do." Again, the powerful ones profit over misery. If a miserable girl gets pregnant, she could choose abortion in order to be able to complete her studies (trying to escape from misery). But if everybody is able to escape from misery, how could the powerful profit? Anyway, when THEY want to do an abortion, they have the money to pay for it in a safe place. On death penalty, those who are on the side of the people know that the State also commits mistakes, so death penalty may be applied on an innocent person, thus it's not desirable. The powerful, on the other hand, believe that death penalty could increase their security, and they don't fear to be killed, because they have the money to buy their freedom. So, in a deeper look, there is plenty of logic in each party's behavior. 

In the beginning of human language, Economics and Ecology were the same thing. A book that will show you this is Hesiod's Works And Days, about 2700 years old. The purpose of this science is to make a living possible for us: we gotta know when to seed and when to sow, hot to combat pests, how to keep the soil fertility, how to fish and hunt, when and how much (if we don't want to destroy the fish and game populations). As anyone can see, the destruction of our environment comes mostly from the separation of Economics from Ecology, as if the former was a structure completely independent from the latter. One important part of economics is the measure of arable land, the yield of agricultural products and the price of food and drink items. This is of vital importance not only to our life quality, but also to the long-term sustainability of our civilization. Another book that shows how a civilization may destroy itself by ignoring the very basics of Economics/Ecology is Collapse, by Jared Diamond.
