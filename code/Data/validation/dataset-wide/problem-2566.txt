I often find that one could really learn something and get to experience what one initially intends going to an Asian Temple by visiting a temple that is not "commercially-motivated" nor has its target towards Westerners. The tough part one usually feels initially is language barrier and thusly the misunderstanding one might experience at these places. 

From my own thinking based on books that I have read, people and nature that I have met and observed (including observing my own self, too), to be "natural" (nature) is to lose those layers of "cocoons" that bar us from being a Buddha since birth. Those layers being - senses and feeling - hence thoughts (judgements, logic, biases, preferences, liking, disliking, stubbornness, heroism, etc etc). Other words, following the buddhist path is to become one with everything and all (even an ant is of greatest "importance" in its own existence in this space). The preceding on "Nature" is only my personal view based on my own experience and thinking. The following brings us to "Behavior": Behavior, in my opinion, is what has been mentioned above - senses and feelings - all these surmises to thoughts. Thoughts bind you to do or not do something regardless whether or not it is "right" or "wrong" or "good" or "bad". It becomes a fuel that "supports" your actions based on senses and feelings. Other words, behaviors are learnt since brith though sense, feeling - thus thoughts. Examples: 

From Vajrayana view, all phenomena is seen as empty, but with the power to manifest countless Buddha qualities..so perhaps one could say Mahayana is a bit more focused on saying phenomena is empty..and Vajrayana a bit more focused on saying emptiness also manifests pure form unobstructedly. The Heart Sutra itself says form is emptiness, emptiness is form, emptiness is no different than form, form is no different than emptiness.. By meditating on deities, we remember that all inner and outer phenomena is pure, unobstructed, and appearing only to help sentient beings with compassion.. 

This is a great question. According to Buddhism, suffering comes from our attachment to things whose nature is actually impermanence. Our goal as Buddhists is to understand the true nature of things, and to accept it and flow with it. Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. Emptiness is none other than form, form is none other than emptiness. Following Nagarjuna's explanations, we should not fall to either nihilism (nothing matters), nor to eternalism (attachment to things as if they are solid and real). Just because the world is illusory, doesn't mean we give up...we should strive to evolve ourselves and be of benefit to the world around us. There are different practices for working with neurotic emotions. In some of them we run from the emotions to seek peace. In others, we confront the emotions to understand their true nature. Take this experience into your practice. It can be a very rich source for energy for your practice. Find the true source of the emotions you are feeling, try to go all the way to the core. 

If one wants to learns Buddhism, one might want to learn first to "un-do" what we are used to like a newborn, born naked, without having (losing all) pre-cognitions / conditions / perceptions / judgements and learning everything from scratch. If a Temple has its target towards Westerners, it would usually tries to "suit" your behavior and ways rather than taking the initiative to "correct" / teach you. So, again, patience is the key, if one so happens to take part in Temples that do not have their "target" towards Westerners. As times go by, one would find himself having conversations with them, the language barrier and misunderstanding would slowly dimmish (if people really would like to communicate, they will find a way. Body language, drawing etc..). All in all, one is not tied to take part in only one Temple. One could participate in the ones I have mentioned here and at the same time others that are more "Westerners-friendly" as well, just to initially experience and learn from both sides. 

The discontent goes the other way: It is not how much you own and can still keep them in possession that makes one content. 

Back to someone who is skilled in weapons/war etc: There is a saying: "The very instant when one decides to drop the butcher knife, is the instant he can become to be a Buddha" So it is not that his skills are "bad". It is the "sense" (intention) and creates the cause (weapons and war). 

"The question is how should I replace these bad motivations by more skillful ones ?" Excellent question. You can replace harmful neurotic emotions such as greed, anger, and jealousy, through recognizing the true nature of your mind and emotions. Enlightened beings and realized masters have given us a path, with advice and practices on exactly how to do this. This is the main goal of Buddhist meditation practices. There are many different approaches within Buddhism, depending on one's needs and proclivities. For example, in some practices you would tend to run away from harmful emotions, to seek a kind of quiet peace. In others, you may directly confront them, staring at them directly until you see their true nature, which is actually primordial wisdom. Developing compassion is also the main point of all Buddhist practice. For example, when understood very clearly, desire becomes bliss and emptiness..and a wisdom of discrimination.. 

Here is an explanation. The Christian church has, in addition to the peaceful teachings of Jesus, also preached hatred, jealousy, and rage throughout its existence. In particular, rather than peacefully co-existing with other ideologies it has sought to suppress and annihilate them. Perhaps the only ideology to survive the cultural genocide of Europe by the Christian Church was Judaism. For the crime of surviving, the Church preached hate towards this ideology and its people for centuries. This hate has exploded into action many times throughout history, including during WWII. According to Buddhism, neurotic emotions such as hatred and jealousy ultimately bring suffering to those experiencing them. In particular, if the ideas become negative actions. And in particular, if the negative actions are not completely regretted later. Part of our work as Buddhists is to find the seeds of all of these neurotic emotions and try to purify them into their stainless wisdom nature which is completely beneficial to all beings. I asked one acclaimed Buddhist teacher about trying to understand the specifics of karma. He answered something along the lines of it is like trying to understand quantum physics as opposed to Newtonian physics. It is difficult for us to presume to understand the details, but yet we can sometimes see glimpses of it at work. 

Then, at the very very last thought before you decided to leave her, your first sight (the beauty of her) comes to "conciliate" your decision of leaving this relationship. And it goes on like this. Let say somehow it turns out OK and you and her have kids. It is another attachment stacked up. You need to raise them. The stress, etc etc, forces you to do something you don't normally do and against your will. 

Can a non-Buddhist marry a Buddhist? In the eyes of a non-Buddhist, yes or no, or maybe. Can a Buddhist marry a non-Buddhist or would he / she refrain from marrying a non-Buddhist? He / she would leave the decision to the non-Buddhist. The end decision to him / her would be the same - sun rises from the east, settles at the west. Water flows, birds sing, etc. All the same. Remains the same. 

Until then, you become discontent. So in the Buddhist view, it is about trying not to "acquire / own" so much, to which one eventually forms a attachment. It is not about being able to own them and be content because they are still in your possession / returning you the amount of "love" you expect / and are still in good condition. All of the above, except the car (but even still can be possible) are required that they "love" you back for the contentedness to take place. The car can't speak or feel, but one would usually form this "imaginary" reciprocals for the car itself -
