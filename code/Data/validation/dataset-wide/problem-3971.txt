If we then re-read Klein, there is even more to say: \begin{eqnarray} x &=& \sum_{\beta \equiv 1 \mod \sqrt{-7}} \mathrm{Re}(\beta) \, q^{\beta \overline{\beta}/7} \\ y &=& \sum_{\beta \equiv 2 \mod \sqrt{-7}} \mathrm{Re}(\beta) \, q^{\beta \overline{\beta}/7} \\ z &=& \sum_{\beta \equiv 4 \mod \sqrt{-7}} \mathrm{Re}(\beta) \, q^{\beta \overline{\beta}/7} \end{eqnarray} and these theta functions explicitly solve the equation $x^3 y + y^3 z + z^3 x = 0$ in terms of modular functions over $\mathbb{H}/SL(2, \mathbb{F}_7)= \langle z \mapsto z + 7, z \mapsto - \frac{1}{z} \rangle $. These sections $x,y,z \in \mathbb{H}$ are modular cusp forms of weight 2 over $X(7)$ -- one must verify that $x, y, z, \neq 0$ exceept at the "cusps". The fact that these theta functions parameterize a curve both on $\mathbb{H}$ and in projective space $\mathbb{P}^3$ does not seem trivial at all. A lot of effort may go into showing the rather strange-looking coordinates we chose do not have exceptional behavior. And these are generators of your canonical ring! 

Additionally, there was a random process called the Harmonic Explorer which looks oddly like a game of Hex and the winning paths converge to $SLE_4$ 

Has the Robinson-Schensted correspondence, as explained by Wikipedia or Richard Stanley, been implemented in any of the standard programming languages. I'm using Python, but I'm open to Java, C++, Mathematica, Matlab. On paper, the bumping is not so bad - I think 1364752 gives you a v-shaped tableau - but coding the algorithm may require linked lists. The regular representation of a finite group can be decomposed into a direct sum of all the irreducible representations of G. The basis of the right-regular representation is the elements $g \in G$ and the group action is $\rho_g(h) = hg$. Then every irreducible representation appears in the sum with multiplicity equal to its dimension $$ |G| = \sum_{\pi \in \text{Irr(G)}} (\dim \pi )^2$$ When G = S(n), the permutation group on n elements, the irreducible representations are indexed by Young-diagrams with n boxes and |G| = n! The Robinson-Schensted correspondence takes this literally and bijectively takes in a permutation and spits out two pairs of (standard?) Young tableaux filled with numbers 1 thru n of the same shape. 

This is surely wrong. Is there a classification of nilpotent Lie groups? Are all nilpotent Lie Groups matix groups? 

In Mean values of multiplicative functions over function fields the mention a proof of Halasz inequality in one of their future pre-prints. In fact here is an a proof from 1999. I would like to see a proof in any way shape or form, as it might lead to a proof of the prime number theorem. 

Then we have to check these have the properties of the real numbers we like: $(a+b)+c = a + (b+c)$, least upper bound property, etc. Oh, I tried writing the definition of Cauchy sequence as a "game". Any leads on that are welcome in the comments. 

and I can go find real math textbooks that indicate the same, but none of them really indicate how cohomology was (implicitly used). The same Wikipedia article on descent cites two examples: 

I find it utterly mind-boggling there is no easy extension of Farey fractions to general quadratic rings $\mathcal{O}_K$ with $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$. It's non-trivial 

I was reading about horseshoes and heterclinic bifurcation but my knowledge of dynamical systems is really old fashioned. as I understand the local stable manifold and the local unstable manifold intersect. I am looking for a differential equation or geometric construction that demonstrates this phenomenon (actually the paper says "surface diffeomorphism" which I just took to mean "differential equation") 

Then $X/G$ is the set of equivalence classes of discriminant $D$ , and by the group action formula: $$ |S/G| = \sum_{[f]} R^\ast (n,f) = R^\ast(n) $$ Every element of $Y$ is equivalent to $z = (1,0)$ (Exercise) for this element: 

Unless your Deligne or Kontsevich you probably have no idea what that means. I read it was: in the process of doing Feynman integrals we have done a lot of other things: a motive is a thing that appears in many cohomology theories 

In these notes of Pezzini and the obvious question arises, is a sphere, a "spherical variety". I'm interested in $L^2(X)$ for the space: $$ X = \{ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3 $$ In order to become a spherical variety I need a couple of things: 

it was called "theory of equations" in certain places in English. one learned how to solve cubic and quartic and other special types. Galois theory was taught literally as the study of symmetric polynomials of the roots - the invariants and coinvariants here's one 

Despite being an open curve, I may not have the infinite time or resources to compute a way out. Is there any way to formalize this notion of approximate winding number? For an open curve we no longer have that the winding number is an integer can we have: $$ \int_\gamma d \big( \log \, z \big) \in \mathbb{Z} + [-\epsilon, \epsilon] $$ for some small number $\epsilon > 0$. This may still not be a good measure of the ``tangledness" of the curve surrounding the red point. 

I am a non-expert and I suspect results like these are not 100% clear to people outside that field. Similar in spirit, does the Polya-Vinogradov inequality imply PNT for arithmetic sequences? That may be a separate question. 

What are the known asymptotics (if any) for the number of arithmetic sequences of a given difference $r(\bar{\delta})$ as a function of the upper density? I am just trying to understand what is happening in the proof of Roth's theorem. Maybe it is possible to get an "explicit" proof of Roth theorem at least in some cases. 

At around $n \asymp 10^6$ these solution sets look pretty homogeneous. I'm a little bit nervious about floating point artifacts or other programming issues. The solution sets look like random spherical harmonics. This might even have a name in the physics literature. There might be approximate algorithms for $n \asymp 10^8$ . 

Your sequence begins $\frac{a}{r}, a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \dots $. The coefficient of $\displaystyle \prod_{i=0}^n (1 + br^{i-1})$ gives a weighted sum of partitions into distinct parts. Let's show how that count works. (NOTE: my $b$ is your $-a$). 

In general the icosahedron has a large symmetry group. It is isomorphic to the alternating group $A_5 \simeq \mathrm{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_5)$. 

Do algorithms exist to find all the patterns in a word? I would like to count all the 3-step increasing sequences (123 i.e. 123, 234 & 345) in some word in the alphabet {1,2,3,4,5} such as "51234321343221343234". I don't care about spacing, so the subword 234 is good, but 23****4 is also good. What if I ask these subwords be disjoint? I would expect a Robinson-Schensted-like algorithm except the increasing subsequences are of a fixed length. Do asymptotics exist in either case? 

Topological spaces can be infinitely varied. From topology point of view even something as deadpan as $\mathbb{R}$ has an enormous amount of structure. What about the Zariski topology in algebraic geometry? They tend to be different than the topology you inherit from their embedding into ambient space.
