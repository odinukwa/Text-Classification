For Kant, if the action has no moral worth, then it is morally neutral. In your example, as James Kingsbery pointed out, there may be hidden duties like that of honoring your parents, which would make it so you have an obvious right thing to do. But if we take the example at face value, in such a case you are merely acting on your desires, and your action therefore has no moral dimension. In this connection it may be worth remembering that actions that are performed merely from desire are not actually free actions for Kant. So in choosing your ice cream you are just like a rock rolling down a hill - totally causally determined and without any moral features. Final addendum points: Evil actions are also conditioned by desire, but in those cases one's desires actually contradict the moral law, as opposed to the ice cream case, where they do not impact it at all. Also, I should say that this answer is focused on Kant, and may not generalize to other deontologists. Thank you. 

Kant discusses the ontological proof of God at around A597/B625... But his discussion of the analytic/synthetic distinction comes right at the beginning of the book - I'm willing to bet it's in the preface. As I'm sure you know though, Kant does think there is synthetic knowledge of a priori truths, though it's debatable whether or not truths about existence would qualify as a priori. 

Truth tables are used to define what validity is. For that reason, they cannot fail to be reliable indicators of validity. There may be cases in which what seems intuitively invalid comes out as valid according to the truth table. In these cases, you will likely want to examine your intuitions or make some clarifications as to your language. For example, this might happen if you treat a counterfactual conditional in the same way as a normal conditional. In this case, people considered the matter and decided that the intuitive problem was due to the counterfactual nature of the conditional, not to a problem with the truth table. Philosophers are very reluctant to conclude that truth tables are not guides to validity because they are definitional of what validity is, so challenging them would require a wholly new conception of validity (not that there aren't such conceptions around, but I assume that's outside the scope of this question). 

Sight as we know it is a hallucination generated to guide the conscious mind through the world. How colours are perceived are a part of this, and so their existence is simply a different mapping within our brain. I think it's a reasonable assumption that most people see colours differently to each other - your blue is my red, etc - as otherwise individuals brains would be generating the same hallucination across the board, which would be far too regular to be realistic in my opinion. Think of it like this. Imagine a wall is made up of different coloured bricks, and they are arranged in horizontal layers so that we see stripes of blue and green. Someone comes along and rearranges the bricks so that one half of the wall is blue, and the other half is green. Someone seeing the wall prior to this event would swear it was green and blue stripes, and someone seeing the wall afterwards would swear it was half blue, half green. It's merely a rearrangement of the existing material goods, forming a different subjective experience to the individuals. 

Knowing is speculation distilled into certainty, via a process of inferred causal relationships and confirmation bias. 'knowing' one thing will encourage us to 'know' other things of a similar ilk due to their close proximity and seeming relationship, but it is worth remembering that at the root of all knowledge is faith in something, rendering all facts merely educated guesses that are pragmatically useful at any given time. This inability to forget knowledge - as you define it - is potentially unhealthy, as it can lead to a shock to the system if previously assumed facts are shown to be false, and so I believe it is always worth remembering that certainty does not imply objectivity, only a desire for such to be the case. Of course, I could be wrong, but pragmatically speaking I am making educated guesses based on my observations to date. 

-What are the philosophical implications of the Higgs mechanism? Developments in science have philosophical implications to the extent they force us to refine philosophical positions we take. Embryonic stem cell research, for instance, is forcing us to refine arguments about when a group of cells become human. A development in our understanding of matter would hopefully affect our understanding of consciousness. Questions within physics aren't, strictly speaking, philosophical questions. Whether an idea can be translated from one theoretical language to another is a philosophical question, and positivism is a dubious answer. If the question is what are the philosophical implications of the Higgs mechanism for theoretical physics then the answer has to do with how physicists handle the translating. But if the question is asking for the philosophical implications in the general sense, that is, to the extent our understanding of matter is affected by the understanding of the theory of the Higgs mechanism, then the answer is wait and see. The role of causality in consciousness is the philosophical question and the Higgs theory does not seem to be developed enough to help us refine our conception of consciousness. 

You are asking what happens when we become aware that what we believe to be the important driving ambition of our life is shown up as insignificant. We experience the sublime. The unpleasant awareness of something more consequential than ourselves which is outside of our knowledge. See the Ridley Scott film, The Duallists, which is based on a Joseph Conrad novel, which in turn draws on a true story of two French officers in Napolean's army who serve effectively, but their careers are consumed by an absurd perpetual standing challenge. Whenever they cross paths they must dual, and somehow they continually fail to kill one another. 

I do not think the possibility of holding contradictory beliefs is controversial. For instance, a simultaneous belief in a god and a causal universe is commonplace. Claiming to know both are true is controversial.. In the preface paradox I claim I both know every statement I wrote is accurate, and I know I made a mistake somewhere. In the lottery paradox I say to a friend who is buying a ticket, "I know you won't win, and I know someone will win." Say a lottery is held which guarantees a winner while maintaining the ridiculously long odds of typical lotteries. I know, with a probability greater than .99 that my friend will lose, so I confidently claim I know he will lose. I cannot claim that each participant will lose, though, because I also know someone will win. The challenge is to define criteria of knowledge which exclude contradictory knowledge claims and yet justify some knowledge claims. Gettier argues successfully that we do not know how to do this. I do not know who argues successfully that we do know how. 

He's stating that if we are capable of making decisions, determinism cannot be true, and that if determinism is true we are incapable of making decisions. This is a clear link between determinism and free will - the two suppositions cannot exist together without contradicting each other. 

Every mind would be imprisoned if we could take hallucinogens freely, as well, it would just be a cell with a TV. 

QM being unpredictable is likely due to the limits of human understanding, and so using it as the lynchpin in any philosophical discussion would be the same as using the sun disappearing and reappearing to confirm the existence of a higher power. The case for free will hinges upon the human mind being able to deviate from the otherwise seemingly deterministic nature of the universe, and quantum mechanics is a nice get out clause for that, however then we have to argue that the human brain can affect quantum mechanics, whilst being driven by something other than quantum mechanics, otherwise it is just QM affecting itself, and leaves us no more free than in a deterministic universe. 

I agree that they oppose each other, as you can't have liberty with equality, and you can't have equality with liberty. Equality taken as an ideal leads to communism, which is shown to fail whenever it is tried. Liberty taken as an ideal leads to anarchy, which is mostly untested but seems unworkable. Equality of liberty would be what I'd suggest we aim for. The same level of freedom for all, seems to make the most sense. 

In a deterministic world the mind is deterministic, but goes through the motions of reasoning to reach its conclusions. In such a universe our actions and beliefs are predetermined, and the state of our mind at the time of reasoning is predetermined, and so the path our reasoning will take is predetermined. The argument being presented is predetermined, and whether or not the mind will accept the rationale of that argument is predetermined. Taking this into account, an argument will only be persuasive if the deterministic mind is in a state where it is receptive to the argument. It relies on the listener having similar enough data patterns within its head for the sound arguments to be seen as sound - they may sound completely invalid if their worldviews are too far apart for the same conclusions to be drawn by each participant. What one mind sees as completely reasonable could be seen as completely insane by another mind. I would say when pondering reason, you should really be pondering perspectives, as rationale is built from perspectives. People will always have their own rationale for what they believe, built off their subjective perspective, and the word unreasonable merely means 'I don't understand' as opposed to 'there is a flaw in your thinking'. All this holds true in a non-deterministic universe as well, however, so deterministic or not is redundant when discussing reason. 

This does not seem to be a question so particular to the music industry. And it is not a question of coming into possession of something. What is purchased in a download of a music file, for instance, but also with the purchase of a DVD, a recording of an NFL game, or a newspaper clipping, is a license to use, with terms limiting the use. We have agreed to terms with the owner of the rights of use. We have made a promise. The moral question boils down to: is there a moral obligation built into every promise? I take Searle's argument for the built in obligation of a promise, in Fact and value, "is" and "ought", and reasons for action, Searle, 2008, to be successful. The specific question is, do we make a promise when we download music? I think it is obvious we do. Musicians who feel these terms are trivial self publish and make their music freely available. The price of admission to a film includes the right to remember the experience and even to tell others about it. If the purple scarf is an original design, then copying it with an intention to sell it is wrong. Society agrees on a time period restricting selling copies of original designs, after which considering the designs to pass into public domain. Copying the scarf for your own use may or may not aggravate the designer. It would be a subjective call, and the designer should be given the opportunity to make the call. 

My answer actually disturbs me. I take Wittgensteins argument against private language as successful, and I take Quine's argument that language is empirical as successful. Here is an example from Wikipedia's article on Wittgenstein's private language argument: "For instance, if one cannot have a private language, it might not make any sense to talk of private sensations such as qualia; nor might it make sense to talk of a word as referring to a concept, where a concept is understood to be a private mental state." Here is a quote from Quine's essay "Epistemology naturalized"(Quine1969): "Language is socially inculcated and controlled; the inculcation and control turn strictly on the keying of sentences to shared stimulation." I'll add that there are languages that omit concepts contained in other languages. There is a language, for instance(I'm sorry, I'm going on memory. Can't find a reference) which describes time as passing us from behind going forward. Like a wind at our back. We see ourselves moving forward, time passing us like a wind in our face. There is also a language (so sorry, no reference) which does not have the concept of contradiction. I take all this to mean that the formulation of our thoughts, and, indeed the concepts it occurs to us to think about, are given to us by our language group/sub groups. Wittgenstein and Quine are saying we cannot express our thoughts independently of society, and the varying conceptual content among languages signifies that even what we think about is determined by our group. When we think about something is often determined by the context of the moment. I cannot argue that we determine a type of concept to think about, nor how to express, even to ourselves, unspoken, the concept. Pain is the classic example of private experience, which cannot be accurately expressed to others, in language, because we do not have access to how others feel when they experience it. But we do not control the experience of pain. And when we do think about it, I think we use the public language. I'm not happy about it, but I only know of arguments against individual determination of thoughts. 

Rationale is developed via our subjective collection of causes and effects over the course of our lifetime. If someone suspects based on their experience that what we are doing will be negative, it is possible they will claim you are being irrational. This may be due to a lack of empathy, as there is a tendency for people to assume that others should have the same conclusions as they do, despite no two people living identical lives, and so each drawing their own conclusions about what is a risk and what is not. The same would apply to being illogical, and when this is stated it is common for the person being criticized to explain why - to them - it is entirely logical. The question of whose logic is correct is a tricky one, as even the most logical and intelligent person in the world may not have the correct set of data to reach a more optimal conclusion than the least intelligent person, who happens to have experienced something which massively increases the odds of their conclusion being optimal. Person A likely does mean that they believe A has a 75% chance for success, whilst B has only a 25% chance for success, but this is not knowledge, it is prediction, and that is notoriously subjective. To answer the question in the title - it depends on the value placed on the results of the risk, and the consequences of things going badly. A rational risk can be taken, if the potential positives outweigh the potential negatives, but that is down to the individual - it's also entirely possible to take irrational risks. 

The first one states that it isn't possible to go beyond what is possible, ie. You cannot create people without them adding to the maximum definition of how many could be made. You could call this the 'blatantly obvious' rule, if there are 100 people then having 100 people must be possible. The second one states that you could be in an environment where 100 people can survive indefinitely, and that is how many you could have there 'for very long'. You can go over this number, but you will not be able to remain above it forever. Think of a spaceship creating enough water for 100 people. You could put 200 people on there, but it would eventually decrease to 100 before stabilizing.
