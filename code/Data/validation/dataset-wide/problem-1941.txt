Its your choice to share medical information. Somehow the notion of continuous employment is still prevalent as well as the "job for life". There are many circumstances that take people out of the employment market. Travelling is a legitimate reason for taking time out of work (some people are fortunate enough to turn it into means of income - travel writers for example). Having children, long term illness, return to education even being in prison are all reasons why people are in and out of the labour market. Resumes are presented to employers as a linear timeline to explain how you got your skills and experience. Your references don't necessarily have to be from former employers, but common convention dictates that there should be a continuous timeline and reference from current employer. It also makes it easier to slot someone into a new or existing role if they are currently doing that role somewhere else. For example if an employer has a vacancy for high altitude, deep sea welding its easier for them to take someone if they are currently employed as a mountain top underwater welder. If you choose to be fraudulent on your resume to cover the gap because a friend has recommended you do it because they have a common convention view of traditional resumes, then you may get caught out and have to take the consequences of your choice. Alternatively, embrace the lifestyle choices that occurred and see that it nothing to be ashamed of. The only issue I could see from presenting a gappy resume is that it may take longer for you to find an employer who is prepared to see past it. 

I'm guessing she was on maternity leave and wanted to bring in the baby to show off. Believe it or not, some people will be angry with her if she didn't! I've had this experience myself. Anyways, what she should have done was give everyone a heads up that she was going to be bringing the baby in. Why? Because yes, it is a huge distraction. What if a client had been visiting? It's a personal thing and not work related so it's kinda awkward if you are trying to impress clients (same thing if someone brought their new dog in for a visit). I also think you are overreacting. I would find it strange myself if someone just randomly brought their dog into the office simply because it's not work related but I would not get angry or agitated. I also think you should have just told her that you appreciated getting the opportunity to meet her child but you have a deadline and it would be great if they could take the conversation into the lobby. 

edit: I've decided that a summary/profile is better then? I want to get out of the gaming industry and move into something more low-key. Is this effective? How would you change it? Do I need to explain why I want to leave gaming? I have a Skills Summary just below this 'profile' section. 

In a nutshell I describe my last position as a "start-up that stopped", slightly flippant I know but if's difficult one to describe. A number of recruiters, when fishing for leads are intent on finding out about the "business" as they've "never heard of it". In essence, I guess, I'm asking for a script that best describes a business that didn't really have a viable product and never got serious funding and frankly was a disaster -negative phrases I do not want to use. My role in it was looking after the software development, not the business capitalisation side of things or whether it was a "viable product". 

From what you've described I would see it as the standard negotiation and barter that goes on in offices on a day to day basis, which results in compromise. Reading between the lines the only person out of the three of you who has an issue with what you did and what happened is yourself. You express a frustration at two other people having differing opinions and basically faffing around making a choice. That's normal, that's ordinary that's the basics of making any decision. It's subjective whether you did the wrong or right thing. The outcome appears to be amicable and satisfactory and I feel from what you've said is that the only person who appears to be dwelling on the situation and possibly tuning it into an issue is yourself. So to answer your question it's neither right nor wrong but rather the middle ground between the two. Sorry it's not a binary answer, but there are things that will always be on a spectrum of answers. Finally its always right to have your own opinions and put them forward in a consistent coherent way and arguing your point is OK. I would say that your headline question is it OK to argue is at odds with your context. 

[background] I have been working on a game and I handed it in for 3rd-party certification. They came back with a couple of issues which I fixed all but one. We had a question about the final issue and it was taking them too long to get back to us so I packaged the game up for delivery in case they no longer required us to fix the issue. I did this because I don't like packaging up the games too much and I thought I'd get it out of the way. It had been tested but QA didn't take the time to do a detailed job so I did it myself. There was no formal procedure for any of this at all. It is my duty to package up games. The company is very informal anyways. [issue] I sent an email to my project manger and the QA just putting the idea out there that I packaged it up in anticipation of the client's response. Both of them immediately sent emails going all over me saying never to send anything to a client that hasn't been tested. I thought their reaction was over the top, out of context, and hot-headed. I didn't understand the severity of their reaction. I asked them if they thought I was stupid and if they don't trust me then ask someone else. (I thought I was just being frank and honest) [now] He didn't like that too much. He has a history of harassing me because of my family status and short mat leave so I am very on-edge with him. I want this kind of thing to stop happening. I would like to have a consistent level-headed trusting manager who doesn't have strong reactions to nothing. How can I improve communications with him? Should I tell him that I don't feel good about his communications because of the previous harassment? 

Read up on your target change and start some home projects in the target programming environment, to start to get comfortable in working in a technology new to you. Imagine your going to learn the piano, reading up on music theory and learning to read sheet music (eg the keywords and syntax), doesn't give you the ability if you don't lay your hands on the keyboard. Next find the most common theory and practice in your chosen target technology. Writing the sequence of notes on the keyboard isn't going to be that useful if you join a band or orchestra that rely in sheet music - in other words learn the basic rules of your new programming language, the code conventions and standards, the design patterns most prevalent. Join a few meetups, groups and forums and engage in them. Practice, practice, practice - that will help grow your base confidence and give you the necessary pointers to look for help when you lack confidence. Try to find a mentor and get then to give you friendly code reviews and pointers. Next look at your cross transferable skills. You already know your current technology environment, what can you take from it to your target environment. You can transition your current workplace skills to a new one. 

Context: the technical development staff stands at 31 individuals, of which I am the ScrumMaster/Development manager responsible 3 cross functional teams of 5 people in each team. Over the last year the business has been turning over (averaged out) 4-5 developers per month, of which I am now one of them as I have given my weeks notice. From my understanding it is attributable to a mid level manager who joined just over a year ago. I've given notice because this individual is too difficult to work with. Staff prior to his arrival say that the company was different. No one post his arrival has stayed longer than six months. Some of the turnover is down to individuals resigning, like my self. Other situations are down to sackings because the developers didn't "deliver" the user stories acceptably. SideBar 1: User stories often are in the from of; New Product Database, 2 days work. What that actually translates to; Re-factoring the existing database, creating new relational structures and ETL-ing from old to new. Re-factor all sprocs and sql statements for applications and place into production. I sat in the meeting where it was decided to dismiss him (the DBA) for being obstructionist, argumentative, not capable of delivering (my first warning signal something was wrong - given I was defending his (the DBA's) position). SideBar 2: The Mid Level Manager is on the business side rather than technical. He has shown some very unsavoury behaviour sexist, racist, Anti-Semitic, physically manhandling people out of meetings: generally obnoxious. What amazes me is that this individual has a huge list of "reputations" on linkedin, gushing about his marvellous skills and great to work with. I would like to exit the company gracefully, but I face with an "ethical" conundrum on two levels. A competency based one as I view his managements skills to be exceptionally poor and then the one about his disgraceful behaviour in the modern workplace towards colleagues (peers and direct reports). I do not, in my last week, want to raise a grievance, but as this company is a highly respected British organisation, who prides itself on it even-handedness to its consumers. I feel that this is a very toxic environment and it should be brought to light. So given I have five working days to go (as of 8 April 13), How do I; 

I'm a relatively-junior dev being out of university for 2.5 years. I've been working at a start-up game dev company and it's not working out. I just don't fit in at all. You can see my other posts to read about this. Here is what I'm looking for: 

too many meetings like 5 hrs a week are getting in the way of me doing much new to ReactJS and the concept of it colleagues and boss didn't provide much guidance or anything about what is expected of me and where everything is the code base is a complete mess that requires a lot of re-factoring and I feel uncomfortable doing this/takes a long time as I am new to ReactJS because my tasks take a while to do because I'm new to the job and no expectations for speed were communicated to me I feel very uncomfortable the lead developer is kind of rude and curt sometimes 

I feel very stressed out and under a lot of pressure. What could I do to improve the situation? I would like to feel more competent and comfortable in the new technology. 

I would go to the project manager or whoever is overseeing the developers and ask them if it's the responsibility of the developers to mentor the junior staff and if that has been communicated to the seniors. If it has been communicated then you just gently remind them : " X manager mentioned that it is part of your duties to mentor junior staff so I am seeking your advice about XYZ." If it hasn't been communicated then set up a quick meeting with all of them to talk about it. If they still won't help you then you need to tell the boss. If they aren't interested in mentoring then they aren't really seniors - they are just kids with grown up clothes on and I would move on. 

Your employer has specifically asked you not to undertake an activity, they have stated the reasons why they do not want you doing it and continuing to do so they will terminate your employ, you have stated to your employer that you disagree with their request and will endeavour to find ways and means to do so and still be visible to them doing it. At some point a decision will be made, either by you to leave because this is disagreeable to you or by your employer as you are will-fully disobeying an explicit instruction. 

It's so they know how close you are to the place of work I would suggest it's so they can work out your geographic closeness to the business. Although there is a lot of "noise" about remote working and work from home, the vast majority of employers want staff who are within an hour /hour and a half commutable distance. The main reason being is that your "fresh" in the morning and if there is an emergency work problem, they know roughly how long it will take you to get in. 

Actually I've realised the only way to deal with this is be blunt. State my circumstances, two young children with dead mother, if I have to explain further then, there is more serious issues with the job than worrying about having to stay late 

I feel very distanced from my colleagues. I'm not sure if it's just this company or all software places so I am seeking your opinion. Also, I think it gets in the way of productivity because no one wants to mentor or share knowledge and that's not really my style. I like sharing knowledge. I work as a game programmer at a small company. When I first started it was just 4 very senior guys in a room and they did not talk to each other or eat lunch together. They set the tone for a silent and disconnected atmosphere. I can understand as they were working on separate projects. I was just out of university and started as a tester. They also gave me an old legacy game to convert and I had no clue what I was doing as I had never made a game before in my life and they were very very rude to me about my 'newbie' questions. That created even more distance than there already was because the manager hired me because there was room to grow into the role. The fact that I'm female doesn't help either. As time went on nothing really changed. I got married and didn't tell them - why would I don't think they would care. I also got pregnant and didn't tell them because a) was afraid of discrimination b) I didn't think they would care (a bunch of young unmarried guys). Also, they can be very judgmental. When I did share some of my personal life like I haven't traveled much in my life they looked down on me. The company grew and they took on more people. When I came back from mat leave they hired even more people but the culture didn't change. The new project manager said some border-lining sexist comments to me about why I'm not home with the baby. He appears to be small-minded and power-hungry. Because of this I am closed off even more to the point where I avoid taking lunch at the same time as anyone else and try my best to avoid any non-work conversation topics at all costs. I'm a very shy, quiet, geeky girl who finds any non-standard/'politically-correct' dialog or confrontation in a work environment to be extremely inappropriate. Is it normal for colleagues to be so closed off from each other? Is a non-game software environment any different? I don't think this place will ever change so what are some things to ask in the next job interview? 

You cannot help future employees. It's their choice to take the employment and their choice to stay or leave. You state that your former employer is litigious ("super sue-happy"), any criticism in a public (and even private) setting could lead you to being litigated against. Put it behind you as a lesson learnt and stop enquiring into the fates and fortunes of any of his employees as all it appears to do is to make you want to do is continue some form of involvement, which by the sounds of what you've said, won't do you any good. 

Bring to light this problem to Senior Management or the Board. Raise a grievance, post my termination date. Not appear to have "Sour Grapes" if 1 & 2 come about 

I'm being treated for depression and I'm "cursed" with honesty. The titles I held with former employers and my specific job roles I held don't match what I want to change to. In many of the roles I've had as senior developer & technical leader, I've written realistic project plans, lead scrums, written project documentation, done the actual project management work of resource allocation, timelines, meetings, negotiation, task allocation, epics, user stories, managed sprint planning, standups and retrospectives and designed effective sprints so that networking,infrastructure and operations are factored into the development plan and kept up to speed with where they fit in and are required. Often I've either been asked to do that by the actual project manager or "helped" to write realistic plans to match the actual work to be done and manage the team doing it. I know I have the skills to do project management, but I have a block when it comes to re-writing my CV to remove the development aspects and (in my mind) dramatically change what I have done to focus on Agile Project Management. I feel very dishonest about changing the official job titles on my employment contracts from my former employers as they mostly include the programming language (senior c# this, .net team lead that) and the descriptive text in my resume is written to back up that title. I've been tasked by my psychologist to re-write my resume to better reflect the roles I would like to do and jobs I want to apply for. I feel very hampered by my employment history and that's also compounded by not having any agile or pm qualifications and my MSc is CS as well. Frankly, I feel typecast and as recruiters with my existing resume keep on phoning and emailing me for programming roles - I'm finding it hard to see how to get out of the trap. In my mind if I was to leave in the official job title and focus on the leadership, agile and PM duties then there is a screamingly obvious mismatch between title and duties.
