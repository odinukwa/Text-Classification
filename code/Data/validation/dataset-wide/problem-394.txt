Once you start introducing other creatures also living on the bonegrass victims then your fields are going to need to be quite bloodthirsty. 

The climate change effect is largely dependent on how much damage humanity has done on the way out. If we've pushed up the temperatures a lot by the time we go, then the effect will be to bring them back down to where they should be, and as it all falls out it could end up being a great healer of the climate. If we've managed to control the damage then it could trigger a global ice age. 

The best known of these being under the wormhole theory. Which allows you to create wormholes for time travel but you can't go back to a point before you created the first wormhole. There's also the classic 

In all these cases you need to model the joint first. What degrees of freedom do I need? How can I most effectively generate that movement while staying within the range of movement of the body underneath? Consider the ankle; two degrees of simple movement and a bit of rotation in the lower leg. The rotation can be displaced upwards so you only need to worry about the pitch and roll in the joint itself which can be done with a compound of two joints. I'm assuming you're going to largely immobilise the back and neck, so your most complex joint is the shoulder, but even there you can run the a similar model to state both the freedoms and limitations on the movement. Power supply is the problem though. 

Following on from the straight up gravitational practicalities that Michael has described. It's possible, but the maths is terrible. You could cheat by keeping everything as it is, and using the arbitrary nature of co-ordinate systems to redefine the "centre" as being the Earth and calculate all the orbits relative to that. Redefining the datum to an arbitrary location is fine when modelling straight lines on an infinite plane, but an absolute pig when describing orbital motion. There is such a thing as a Geocentric Orrery, you wouldn't be the first to try it. (If you really want to take this to the illogical conclusion, place yourself top dead centre on an immobile world and calculate relative to that) The reason for making the Sun the centre of our solar system, apart from the fact that it is, is that it simplifies the calculations considerably. The same is true around the centre of the galaxy. On a universal scale though, you're probably ok putting the Earth in the centre and plotting the relative movements of galaxies against it as we're back (as far as I'm aware) to linear rather than orbital movement. 

When you have a great enemy then you start thinking that your enemy's enemy is your friend. Of course this sort of thinking is entirely erroneous as the current generation is able to observe in Syria, but in the crazy days of the cold war people couldn't see that. Those days were very black and white, us and them. To get the two sides to cooperate you would need to represent a greater threat than nuclear annihilation, and as importantly, the loss of "our way of life". This is why the big evils of the cold war era tended to have total global domination/destruction on their minds. It was the only way to get attention away from the primary enemy. Anything less than that would be responded to by each power picking the side that better suited their current world view and backing it with money and weapons in the hope that the outcome favoured them. Lots of small time despots came to power and maintained their power this way through the cold war. 

Kaiser Wilhem II As Tony Blair might say, "tough on technology, tough on the causes of technology". Wilhelm II, the last Kaiser of Germany, the man who largely caused the First World War. Without WWI, you can prevent WWII, without WWII you could set back rocketry and nuclear physics for generations. 

Ok they're 16th rather than 15th Century, but if you want ornamental they don't get much more impressive and they're also particularly effective in combat. I know I shouldn't be answering this because it's too broad and opinion based but I really like the flamberge. 

x-axis being "forward" They should be applied in pairs, one forward one aft for pitch and yaw or one top one bottom for roll, to turn about the centre of mass. However if you pair them same side you could "sidestep". 

The simplest problem is that it would have been cost a king's ransom to make. As you say it was hard to refine, and as a result of that, incredibly expensive. 

Yes, but not in a year The only solution within a year is the war to end all wars scenario that's already been covered, so let's look at the long term solution. It's going to be nasty, it's going to be bloody, but I think it could be done in a minimum of two, maybe three generations. If every country, every government, decides this is the way forward (yeah right, like that could happen). The first thing is a change in cultural attitudes. Going to war is considered a dramatic and romantic thing to do. War is glorified in the media. This must end. War must be depicted as nasty, bloody, a nightmare to all concerned, and unacceptable under any circumstances. Historical film, books, poetry and documents including religious texts that glorify war must be expunged, as must any leaders, speakers or others who don't get with the program. Nationalism and the concept of national borders must be broken down and a universal language introduced. Free movement of peoples is critical to this plan. Global free education, free healthcare and basic income is required. All must be equal, free movement of people should become irrelevant as all places are equal (I'm moving somewhere with better weather), but if any regional power tries any repressive behaviour, the locals can just up and move away. People will fight this, I don't understand why, but people fight tooth and nail against the world being made a better place. There are going to be messy revolutions springing up all over the place for at least a generation. Freedom of speech will need to be suppressed (don't like that one do you). Any incitement to war must be crushed, any mention of the things people like to go to war about (nationalism for example) must be suppressed. What all this is leading on to is creating a global monoculture where everyone is educated, nobody lives in crushing poverty, everyone's basic needs are covered and everyone has more to lose than gain by going to war. Slowly the concept of war as a viable option will fade. 

Not really The risk isn't about pandemics, they're normally viral as bacterial infections are, on the whole, not as contagious. The risk is about things that are currently minor no longer being treatable. Antibiotics are given as a matter of course to prevent post-operation infections for example. 

There's a balance to the world population that hasn't really shifted since Roman times (probably longer but I haven't really looked further). There's a small wealthy class and a large underclass and occasionally a moderate middle class. In the current age we've outsourced our underclass to the far east but the same balance still holds. To maintain your culture you can't keep one group and remove the other the way you might think, you have to maintain the balance somehow. To remove 80% of the population you'll have to do it across the board, you can lift people out of absolute poverty but relative poverty will remain. 

One man in one little ship Power at a point, while he could unbalance a fight, he can win battles, but he can't win a war. The problems: 

Go back to a point in time slightly before you left and make a change to your time machine design that would mean rather than being a time machine, it became a time machine simulator. This prevents you from having to kill your own grandfather to stop you building it and you still get to have your, now simulated, adventures in time. The paradox will work itself out, honest. Sorry, I don't think in practice that you can ever go home, though you may be able to create something very similar and long as you keep those pesky quantum weather butterflies away.

The principle was understood but as Thucydides mentions there are targetting and focus problems once you build up high enough numbers of mirrors to have a significant effect. So let's work backwards from more modern technology to help with that problem. Consider a device, it looks a bit like a sextant. From one side you see the sun, on the other side your target. It's mounted on top of your mirror and moves with it. Your job as a solider of the 21st mirror battalion is to keep the image of the sun aligned with your target point on the image of the ship. You've trained for the past 6 months to be able to do this. This requires relatively advanced optics and engineering, the sextant didn't come along until the 1700s, but the principle is sound. For more basic technology consider two linked markers, when one shows/blocks the sun and the other shows/blocks the boat, your aim is correct (or at least good enough for government work). Consider instead a mirror with holes in it, held a reasonable distant in front of you, eyes aligned to the centre, the holes are marked in 4 quarters, the sun is visible through one hole, the ship must be visible through the diagonally opposite hole for correct aim. The idea here is to find some way for the individual soldier to accurately aim the mirror without having to identify their own personal bright spot on the ship, as soon as you've solved that problem the death ray becomes viable regardless of technological level. 

Though perhaps like Ares and others, the god is both aid and terror even to their own side. On the other hand 

Kings were appointed by god and ruled in gods name. There were no atheist kingdoms, they're almost impossible without constant military suppression of the population. It's much easier to suppress the rebellion in their minds by saying that god appoints kings and they rule by right. 

Maybe Chaos and unrest tend to cause backsliding, not forward thinking. Populism will rise (has risen) with a basis of "it's not like it was in the old days". The problems will be blamed on other people. There will be a rejection of anything that comes from 'the other' especially if that other is the group being blamed for the problems. The result will be isolationism and reduction in technological and economic growth. If another cold war is sparked by the isolationist policies then it's possible that the result will be a new space race to be the first to have an off-world colony. Right now, that's probably the best hope for getting off this rock, but it's not going to be a comfortable ride. 

Energy is the key to this. The energy required to destroy a building with a bomb is fundamentally the same as the energy required to destroy a building with an orbital strike. That's going to mean you remove the building and leave a crater of approximately the same size regardless of which approach you use. Same energy, same direction of impact (above), same damage. The biggest difference on the ground will be the cleanup, you're not going to need bomb disposal teams. The fires caused by bombing in WWII were the result of incendiary bombs rather than high explosives. Bombs specifically designed to start fires rather than cause explosive destruction. Modern bombs aren't designed that way and mostly just cause explosive damage. On a related note:
