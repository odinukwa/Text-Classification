Um....until we developed tools we were prey especially to the big cats on the African plains. We still are occasionally. House cats called polydactyls have one or more extra toes. These are sometimes called Hemingway cats. Often these extra digit form a unit in the place where the thumb exists in a human. We have one of these cats and have raised severe as fosters for the local SPCA. I swear they are more intelligent than your average house cat and they can use the opposable extra digits as we do an opposable thumb. Mine opens a cabinet door with them. If tigers or lions started developing extra digits like house cats I would be afraid, very afraid! 

I grew up in the sub tropics. I ended up in Nebraska for a while and then England. You need to look up seasonal effective disorder (SAD). It is a very real depressive condition that is caused by the difference in the amount of sunlight you get from the amount you grew up with. It can be treated by things such as light boxes and high wattage incandescent bulbs but none of those are quite the same as getting as much sunlight as you grew up with. How people would handle the cold would depend on how well they are clothed and prepared for the conditions. Luckily I had access to proper clothing for the environment and was taught to dress in layers. If the individual(s) have to do things like drive or learn how to keep their homes warm without sufficient explanations it could cause a problem also. 

This would be called sports. This caste would become professional athletes. In one sense, the original Olympic Games reflected preparation for war: hammer throw, spear throw, wrestling, running, jumping, shot put (strength), etc. Add more modern martial sports like archery, fencing, shooting, biathlon, etc. Add in orienteering (quickly moving over terrain with a map and compass), and more abstracted martial activities. Perhaps sports are restricted only to this caste. Perhaps these sports are restricted only to this caste and other castes only participate in others (badminton, baseball, soccer, table tennis, bowling). Or perhaps anyone can participate in these sports but only clans within this caste compete in the Olympics. It would be oriented towards the level of weapons that are known. If your society has firearms, target shooting, skeet shooting, paintball competition, etc, would directly contribute to military prowess. But being in great physical shape with high stamina, endurance of pain, eye-hand coordination, etc, would give you a huge advantage over more sedentary people. I'd have more problems trying to imagine a society in which no killings occur. Not even accidental (manslaughter)? Really? No one dropping something out a window onto someone's head? No one pushing someone in jest and the person falls down the stairs to their death? No one using the wrong ingredients in a food dish and accidentally poisoning someone? Not one single person getting angry and stabbing someone with a kitchen knife in a moment of passion? I can conceive of a world where murder is extremely rare and warfare doesn't happen, but... 

New Orleans is an area you will want to look at for inspiration. Also be aware that any low lying area that has massive storms such as hurricanes pushing storm surge inland before them is going to have problems with newly interred caskets coming out of the ground. 

I have a question. Are these nomads human or did they evolve on the planet with this creatures? If they are human then all bets are off. You cannot drop humans on a distant planet and expect them to survive in the native environment at all much less on one particular animal. We evolved to prey on and as predators of creatures on this planet. Finding a niche for us to live in another planet's evolution will pretty much get you panned in today's science fiction crowd but if you decide to make it fantasy then you don't have to worry about protein, calorie counts and so forth. On the other hand if you chose to make the nomads similar to humans but having evolved on the other planet your nomads can have evolved to prey on these animals before they domesticated them and the animals could believably fulfill most of their needs. Throw in a few native plants, roots and berries and you have enough of a varied diet to make a good story. 

Great ideas! Pretty heavy on diseases and biological explanations, so how about a few that are different? 

I believe the instant you put something into one side of the portal, out comes out the other, as if you stepped through a doorway. Do you mean what happens if you turn off the portal while the object is halfway through when the portal closes? If you want to destroy something -- as in the game -- it's easier to open up one side of the portal high above the target and one side on the floor beneath the target and let the target fall repeatedly through until it reached terminal velocity, then close the portal, so the object crashes at high speed into the floor. Or open a portal high above the target and then open the other side under a very heavy object so that it crashes onto the target. 

This assumes that your teleporting doesn't magically push things aside to make room for your arrival. Get a bunch of metal cable, and create a grid of spools in the ceiling in a grid about a foot apart. Each cable will have a weight attached to it that, and is long enough to go from floor to ceiling. In the evening, you let the cables down so the entire interior of your shop has floor-to-ceiling cables. Depending on how the teleporting determines space, they either won't be able to port in, or they will port in and will be skewered with a cable in them. In the morning, you crank the cables back up into the ceiling. So you need to clarify two questions as well: 

Human brains are hardwired to understand human language. Alien brains won't be. We come into the world preprogrammed to understand sentence structure, syntax, tense and the like. All Mom and Dad have to do is plug in the words. They show us a fish and say fish and we are then able to use that word, by itself, eventually in a phrase and then in a sentence. When you think of aliens understanding our language you are not making them alien enough. They may communicate all or in some part by any of the senses. We use hearing. They may use scent for instance. My question back to you would be why would they understand us? As far as "the message" itself don't forget that the first "message" they are going to pick up from us is going to be old radio and then T.V. shows. Talk about things that could easily be misconstrued! 

Having worked in military satellite communications for about a decade I would have to say that you need a source of interference in the same range as whatever satellites you have that you can put up. On our own world certain entities use certain "bands" to communicate back and forth. A radio source either natural or man made compromising your satellite's transmit and/or receive will make most communications signals unusable. However if the planet is to remain unable to communicate the interference must be very broad and something that cannot be "fixed" easily. Without knowing whether the situation would be permanent or if it starts at some point and maybe ends at another I cannot go any further. Let me know because my husband was a military communications instructor and I can get him involved to find you a solution. 

Quick Answer: Here's a really good paper on the subject. One graph in the paper indicates about 30 milliseconds for most of the audio -- muzzle blast through echoes -- to be received 9 meters from a rifle. Onto that, you'd add processing time, which I would guess would also be measured in the low milliseconds. The processing time should be fairly constant, and you could run multiple detectors -- optimized for different distances and directions of fire. The dominant times would be: a) how much of the 30 or so milliseconds your detector needs to see to make the call, and b) the distance of the gun from the cyborg -- depending on the direction of the fire. My musings: So it depends on the relationship of the cyborg to the bullet's path as to what it will hear. If the bullet is fired at or near the cyborg, and if the bullet it supersonic, the cyborg might first hear an impact -- though that would be hard to distinguish from other sounds -- followed by the shockwave from the bullet, followed by the "bang" of the gun, then echoes and reflections of the shockwave and the "bang". If the bullet is subsonic, there will be no sonic crack, but if the bullet goes beyond the cyborg there may still be a fairly unique "zing" of a fast object flying by. If the bullet is fired away from the cyborg, it will hear the "bang" first, then some of the sonic boom. And then a fair amount of reflections and echoes. Loudness-wise, an unsurpressed rifle can be 160 dB very close by. (This is why suppressors or hearing protection are a big deal: percussive sounds like this will damage your hearing if greater than 140 dB. Remember that the dB scale is logarithmic.) Sound intensity falls off with the square of the distance, though if you're close there are probably not a lot of sounds in your city that are as loud as an unsuppressed gun, if only because of lawsuits for hearing damage. Msalters' answer is fascinating. I imagine their product uses multiple sensors, spread out over city blocks, to triangulate the position of the shot. (Not an easy task due to reflections/echoes, etc.) So, all that said, if you only intend for your cyborg to determine that a shot has been fired somewhere nearby, the time to detection would vary depending on whether the shot was fired towards or away from the cyborg (with supersonic bullets, at least). At an absolute minimum, if a supersonic bullet was fired at the cyborg, the shockwave would reach the cyborg in as little as 1/3 the time it would take the "bang" to propagate to the cyborg. At a maximum, the shot would be fired away from the cyborg and we'd have to wait for the "bang" at the speed of sound. If you want to locate the shot, you would have to wait until multiple cyborgs hear the shot, and coordinate between themselves. (Or perhaps one cyborg that has a pretty long distance between its "ears", but echoes/reflections will still make it difficult.) Actual recognition time is dominated by how much sound you need to hear to capture enough of a picture of the sound wave to try to identify it, followed by processing time. Considering you have cyborgs, I assume there is a lot of computing power, so that would add something on the order of a few milliseconds. 

If you are talking about human habitability then there may be a serious problem with growing crops humans could eat unless there is little or no seasonal variation. If you are talking about native life only then it should not be a problem because any life would evolve to fit the planet it springs from. 

Whooo (like halting a horse) there, "With that in mind, I imagine that some of these planets if not all would be capable of having sentient life." While one or possibly more of these planets may be the best chance of finding life on a different world finding intelligent life is a totally different situation. In only one instance has intelligent life here on Earth been proven on a world filled with life for millions of years. (Yes there is a questions whether we can classify dolphins, whales or even some apes as intelligent but for now we will stick to humans because we are the only ones capable of leaving the planet at the moment unless of course we take some of the others.) While some people think life on Earth may have arose from life on Mars or from elsewhere in the universe via extremophiles we do not know if panspermia (the name some scientist have given to that theory) will actually work or not. I will be thrilled to find some sign of life one one of these planets. I am not sure about sentient life. At only 40 light years if it were less advanced than us I would be concerned about our future effect on them. If it is more advanced than us I would be terrified of what they would do to us when not if they discovered we are here! 

Perhaps these names could be very specific so they don't speak about "oldest brother" but have a specific word for that. And perhaps that word depends on the gender of the speaker. And perhaps that word depends on the relative social statuses of the speaker (see "honorific languages"). And perhaps the word depends on the person's zodiacal sign and the year in which they were born (as years are named in many cultures and viewed as influential). So there might be 144 different names for a particular relative, based on which month and which year they were born in. So the person being interviewed might well name the individual fairly specifically, but an outsider trying to figure out or to use the description might find it nearly impossible. For example, I think of U.S. servicemen who learn Japanese from Japanese girlfriends: the problem is male speakers and female speakers will use different words. So perhaps the investigator is male and the witness is female. Or maybe the investigator is a middle-aged, married male and the witness is a young, single female. If he tries to ask anyone about the relationship he's given, they will totally misunderstand him. Thus it's not that the witness can't say, but that the investigator can't use the "name". (Oh, and perhaps actual names are viewed as sacred and only immediate family members actually know your name. Or perhaps the opposite: human names are profane -- there is only One Name. Everyone else uses relationships.) And we're not even getting into multiple uses of relationship words. "Hey brother, can you spare a dime?" The person is not your brother in the genetic sense. Similarly, I had an "aunt" and "uncle" growing up who were simply friends of my parents, and I know people who talk about "cousins" who are not cousins in the general sense of the word. 

I suffered from hypotention a great deal as a young woman. You wouldn't want me on there. Although most of the time I did ok there were times I could barely get out of bed. 

I don't see why not but I am not sure why it would be the best idea. A great deal of the ocean's floor is more or less deserted. I would build a stationary underwater facility in a particularly interesting spot and a couple of underwater "freighters" to ferry supplies to it and to remove waste items. It would do two things. First it would help us study our own planet and secondly it would be a place to train crews for the long journey to other planets like Mars. We would learn a lot about making the trip but have the people a lot closer at hand in case we run into serious issues for a long trip like that that we have not yet considered. 

Paul O. Müller was was a Austrian theoretical nuclear physicist who was stupidly drafted into the the German army and sent to die on the Russian front at Pechenkino near Sukhinichi on March 9 1942. Instead of having him die have him be captured and then the Soviets use him to run a separate nuclear program rather than use the Rosenberg's to steal the information from us. That way they could be on a par or even ahead of us. 

I upvoted @Mormacil's answer, but let me give you an analogy that you may find useful. In some countries, you can refer to a building by a street address: 1854 Jackson Lane. You could find Jackson Lane and go in the correct direction and somewhere adjacent to 1853 and 1855 you'll find 1854. 

In Japan, this is not true. As I understand it, the buildings are numbered in the order they are built. In Central America this is even less true: you will be given directions like, "Go down the main road towards Guacamal, and 200 meters past the dairy, turn right. Then proceed to the park where the big tree used to be (before it burned down), and turn right." I think this could provide some inspiration for names for people. They could be names related to position/role/job (as in Mormacil's answer) or familial relationships, or shared incidents, as several other answers suggest. But I think that if you get your head around how street directions vary from place to place, it could help with your name issue. (In my mind, the key is that "names" are relative paths and if you encounter a problem anywhere along the path, you're stuck, but you may pull something else out of the analogy.)
