I think it's the pedantic difference is between "human language" and "computer language". Right now, there probably isn't a distinction in most legal definitions pertaining to translation rights, but it would be a quick fix if someone wanted to challenge it. Laws typically contain a "definitions" section where they define words they use. The definitions they use don't have to be the common usage, it's just the usage they are intending in that law. They would very quickly amend the definition to mean "human language" (carefully crafted to be precise and close the issue). However, if you were to get a colony of like minded systems engineers to use a computer language as your day-to-day communication, then you might have to start training a translator :) 

The previous answers here already covered the theory pretty well, but here are a few practical examples to further the point that you cannot rely on your perceptions of reality as being reality itself. Inattentional blindess: also called perceptual blind, this is where your senses experience something, but you do not have at that moment the capacity to process the information because it is unexpected in the context of the observation. This failure of perception is always a potential and can cast doubt on whether a sense is truly perceiving the whole picture. The example that comes to mind first is The Invisible Gorilla (Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons), but wikipedia has many more examples. $URL$ $URL$ Color test: a page of colored words are placed in front of you and you are asked to read the words (or say the color of each word). The words are all names of colors, but the color of the word does not match the description of the word. Your brain will eventually start confusing the two perceptions. $URL$ Another common example is the placebo effect which has been in use in medicine for hundreds of years and has ancient roots. So, you said, "It seems self-evident that the phenomena we sense are accurate and correlate to the real world," but I would argue that with these examples it is plain that our senses are highly contextual and subjective. 

Your example assumes that "medicine" is making some absolute claim of doing something, but that is not what medicine claims. If "medicine" is the general population's understanding of medicine, then you may have a point. However, to medical researchers, medical practitioners, and other medical agencies (FDA, etc), "medicine" describes our knowledge of chemicals acting on the body and everyone in those groups understand the limits of our knowledge on the topics. That's why you will always hear them qualify claims like "results may vary", "may not be appropriate for everyone", "side effects include...", etc. So, in a medical journal where they are being technically precise with their words, they will say things like "the p-value was 0.0076 with an alpha of 0.01, so the null hypothesis _____ can be statistically rejected." They will not say (unless they are being lazy) things like "this drug cures _____ ." It is always qualified. A number without a confidence interval is not useful information. So in that sense, medicine is what it is - simply measurements of experiments and statistics. It's hard to say that's wrong (unless someone is being lazy our fraudulent, which isn't the point). "Medicine" could also mean our practical application of our observations, and in that case it's proven wrong all the time. And "wrong" here means that the statistics of a thing are no longer probable at a given confidence level. This is different from the claim that something always our never happens. 

I'd be shocked if there wasn't someone somewhere who believed in Odin. I think the reason that some religions get snuffed out is that they are verifiably false. The religions that persist are those that are not verifiable - that is, not testable. We now have the ability to see first hand that there is no massive turtle holding the earth, we know what causes lightning, we've never found evidence of cyclopses, we understand weather patterns and natural disasters, and we know that there are no chariots pulling the stars in the sky, etc, etc, etc. This pretty much discredits the entirety of many ancient religions. The religions that billions still believe in are not fundamentally testable. There may be bits and pieces that can be tested (age of the earth), but those parts are not fundamental enough to shut down these religions as a whole. So, they persist where others faded. 

Take the example of momentum and apply Galileo's logic. Momentum equals mass x velocity. If you double the mass, you double the momentum. A ball with twice the mass will have twice the momentum. If you take two balls, each having the same velocity, and tie them together, the new ball has more momentum than the heavier ball alone. The smaller ball does not act as a "parachute" to momentum. Now, if you take the same example and say that the velocities are exactly opposite (equal magnitude but pointed in the opposite directions), then the resulting momentum would be in the direction of the heavier ball, but it would be less than the heavier ball alone due to the "parachute" effect of the smaller ball. In the case of dropping the ball, Galileo is being contradictory in his decription of the smaller ball. One way is to say "this ball is fast and that ball is faster" and the other way is to say "this ball is fast and that ball acts against motion creating a negative force". The former adds the speed of the ball, the latter subtracts it. Conceptually, he is equating "less" with "negative". This would be a fallacy of equivocation. *Edit The above is only true when considering a real-life example with air resistance and other modern common sense knowledge. If you neglect air resistance (as Galileo did for in this example), then Galileo's statement is sound. Aristotle's view was so primative that it's hard to think about it in terms of his restricted knowledge. If a mass has a mystical set speed, then it makes sense that it would slow down a larger mass, but then they are the same mass and should be going faster, so the conclusion Galileo make is that this can't be true - which is correctly reasoned.
