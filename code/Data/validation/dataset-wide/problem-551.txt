I now get that I answered the wrong (opposite question) The two most common types of flats are 1) pinch 2) puncture Can also have the spoke puncture the tube from the inside but nothing a wheel diameter can do about that. Not sure about puncture but I can think of a situation of pinch flat. I know wheels don't come in a radius of 30 cm and 50 cm but for simplicity lets assume they do. Assume you are going 10 mph and hit 10 cm curb The tire / wheel must absorb the sine of the angle The 30 cm tire will have a larger angle Take it to extremes 

I have removed vandal spray paint from a cars with rubbing compound. If you just misted it and bike had nice baked paint then there is a good chance. It might not work but it is sure worth a try. Also search on overspray removal. I used to take my truck inside the gate at a refinery and it got over sprayed badly a couple time and they managed to remove it without repainting. Don't know how they did it but somehow they did. But I would start with rubbing compound. 

gravity / wind resistance = c3 * r velocity1 / velocity2 = r1 / r2 If one weighs twice as much r1^3 / r2^3 = 2 r1 / r2 = 2^1/3 = 1.26 = velocity1 / velocity2 OK you are not a rock and you are on a bicycle. Same forces at work. Going up you pay full price for weight and coming down you only get paid pack the cube root. 

Let's not use the term stopping power as front wheel has more stopping power as during braking weight is transferred to the front wheel. Going to assume rim brakes. From your question is appears the rear brake has less grab (friction from pad to rim). Front and rear should have the same amount of grab. Locking up the front wheel is not something you should do. On the rear once you have enough grab to lock up the wheel then more grab is not going to make any difference. Locking up the rear is not a good practice but on a good dry brake you should be able to lock up the rear wheel. Things to examine 

If you unscrew to far / hard the core comes out. You probable loosened the core and then it blew out. Some sets of tubes just don't have the core very tight. Get a tool to remove the core - it is also used to tighten it. Tighten the core. I even use a dab of locktite but don't get it in the rubber mechanism. Some tubes do not have serviceable cores (won't come out). You would probably be better off with those type of tubes. When I get a flat I save the core, retaining nut, and cap so I have spares. 

They clearly express the benefits: consistent and powerful braking feel along with the quietest braking in most riding conditions If normal riding achieved that SRAM would not have a specific procedure. For one they warn not to lock up the brakes. If you deposit an uneven layer I would suspect the consequences to be permanent. I don't get your logic on if BSO does not do it then it cannot be dire. I don't want my bike to perform like a BSO. Service Manual Bed In Procedure 

These tubes are costing money. A quality puncture resistant 2.25 tire will cost you less in the long run. 

I want a gravel racer for exercise / speed in town but it is not enough different from by cyclocross to justify. And I put new wheels on the cyclocross two years ago and I will never wear them out. But if you have road bike and if you had mountain bike you would ride just one more day a week then go for it. It does not need to be an expensive bike. Some times you get first time buyers that want a bike the will do everything. Pick a bike that will do your primary task and don't break the bank. Start with a mid range bike. I see questions of I want in my first time bike and not sure how I will use it and I have a budget of $2000. My reaction is buy an $800 bike. Don't spend $2000+ on bike until you know exactly what you want. As for a max. Unless you are a competition rider it would be hard to justify more than 5. My collection and how I justify/use from oldest to newest 

I like this one as it supports multiple parameters It is a calculator and a chart BikeCalc Multiply speed by time to get distance 12 mph X 1.5 hours = 18 miles 

If the disc is not touching (as you insist) then it must be the bearings. Take the disc out or pads out and verify. A more likely scenario is the the disc is indeed touching. At speed you get a higher frequency of touching and the materials heat up and expand slightly. With the expansion they touch even more and now the touching is audible. 

Lower pressure for a larger contact patch to increase traction is common. Cyclocross riders (for one) use low pressure. Weigh that against pinch flats. As you lower the pressure you increase chance of pinch flats. In snow the pot holes and bumps are partially hidden. Tread type and depth will also affect snow traction. 

I ended up taking it apart, clean, polish with 600 sandpaper, and grease. Got it to move / rotate. It was very dirty as I used that bike to explore the city during a flood. If you have this setup I recommend you tear it down and clean every couple years and after submerging in muddy water. Comment from Nathan is valid if it is totally frozen. But I would recommend a separate longer bolt. Got the slack out of the chain: 

Cheap it (optional) At most you are gong to get 3 chains. In the 3rd chain wait for it to skip and replace chain, cassette, and chain ring. As Hick commented a chain ring will typically last two cassettes so only cheap it when you know the chain ring is also on its last leg. 

For that level of damage you were carrying a lot of speed. If you cannot see the road you need to assume it is less than perfect. What you can do in the future is better speed control. Debris is little ball bearings. If you are going too fast there is not much you can do about it. Touch the rear easy first to see where you are in traction but you need to quickly get on the front as it has most of the stopping power. You may have been better off trying to ride it out. Wide, soft rubber tires, at lower pressure. But still in the proper pressure range. Downhill clothes have more protection but they have limited movement. A good helmet firmly buckled. Cyclocross will teach you braking as they almost always have an off camber downhill and you get to fall slow on grass. There is it almost all front as the rear will wash out easily. Not sure it would work on the road but in CX uncleat uphill lets you keep the bike more upright and an easier bail. At speed already in the lean this probably would not be effective. But I have seen road pros uncleat at speed when it looked like things were going south. 

No way the brakes trued the wheels. Now it is possible the brakes realigned in a way they rubbed less. 

25 mm would be at major disadvantage on dirt canal towpaths. 32 mm with touring or road type tread is only at minor disadvantage on the road. Slightly more rolling and air resistance but you pick up softer ride, more traction, and less pinch flats. You can put smaller tires on the adventure bike but I doubt you could put 32 mm on the road bike. 

Cool bike but that is a race bike. Consider a bike that is designed for a load. Look at the seat stay on the Roubaix. That bike is not designed to take a load behind the seat. Putting a rack on Roubaix is like putting a trailer hitch on a Ferrari - it has the horsepower but it was not designed for the load. 

If by efficiency you mean braking power then yes maximum braking power is right at the verge of locking up. Braking does not need to be performed at maximum braking power. Often you don't need to slow down or stop as fast as possible. There is static and kinetic friction. Kinetic is when the wheel skids. Kinetic friction is lower so once you start to skid you have less braking power. Maximum braking is right up the edge before you skid. The trick is know where that is so modulation is used. But if you know right where the edge is then no need to modulate. Off road where surface varies it is very hard to know exactly where the maximum is so even very good riders get near that edge and modulate. ABS in cars auto-modulates. Race cars do not have ABS as if you know where the edge is then that is maximum braking. I disabled ABS in my sport car. For longer braking like a long down hill then modulate to cool the brakes. But that is a different modulation in you should come all the way off to get some air cooling between the brake surface and the pad. More discussion from OP on modulation. 

Aluminum has not changed in the 10 years All we know is your last aluminum, high quality, strong frame bike lasted about 10 years The best guess is your next aluminum, high quality, strong frame will also last 10 years Really that is the best guess That is as vague as how long will a current pair of sneakers last me? And the best guess for how long my next pair of sneakers will last is how long did my last pair last. Aluminum fatigues and steel does not fatigue. As stated in a comment steel does fatigue - well not always. Mild steel will not normally admit fatigue crack growth if the applied stresses are below about 10% of the strength of the material. Materials, such as aluminium alloys, do not have any such fatigue limit. If a cyclic load is applied, aluminium alloys will always fatigue. For the same strength a steel bike is typically going to be heavier than aluminum. But you get a bike that is much much less susceptible to fatigue. With steel you also get a bike that will take a ding (dent) and not compromise structural strength to the extent of aluminum. Not exactly the same thing but at the molecular level they are related. Frame Materials Found a quoted number. Just because it was on the Internet does not make it right but here is a 5-10 year quote. Bike Frame: Aluminum Vs. Steel 

On a cyclocross your CD (drag coefficient is not much different). You are the same basic shape. It is a little taller so you have a bit more more frontal area Are you sure you are the same weight and power? Would any of them be willing to swap bikes and test. I get dropped on rides on my street CX but it is because I am just not as strong. Based on your comment I think you are confusing CD with area Drag = CD x Area x Velocity x Velocity If you are getting dropped while drafting as a team (they are not trying to drop you) you cannot blame that on aerodynamics. The guy(s) in the front have more more drag than you even if you are sitting a little taller. If you are getting dropped you are not helping the team. Take a shorter turn when you are in front. Try and line up behind the next tallest rider. 

Looks like the finish is rubbed off. You should seal the carbon fiber to protect it from water. Water will cause the carbon fiber to swell. You can seal with nail polish or a lacquer. This is a video on repair. I think tape (alone) is a bad idea as it will hold moisture. I think a jubilee clip is a bad idea as it will tend to crack the finish. 

The brake and fork could be at a natural resonance frequency. Like if you shake a bus pole at just the right frequency you can get it to shake. Is there any play in the headset or brake? You can try shortening the pad. Give up cantilever brakes for a cyclocross means it road bike. And you need to change out the levers to go side pull. 

This is similar to a flat course versus a hill. The square factor in the drag is the drag. Let's assume a 20 miles out and 20 miles back You can hold 20 mph in no wind Your area A is constant cd is constant p is constant On a dead still day your work is 2 hours 1/2 cd p A (20^2) dropping out all the constants 2 hours (20^2) Lets assume a 10 mph head wind You exactly even things wind resistance out with 10 mph out and 30 mph back You have 20 mph net wind out and 20 mph net wind back Problem there is time time out is 20 mile / 10 mph = 2 hours time back is 20 mile / 30 mph = 2/3 hours (2 + 2/3) / 2 = 8/3 / 2 = 8/6 = 4/3 So exactly 1/3 more work because you have the same effort for 1/3 longer Now say you want to hump it for the same time 1.5 hours out plus .5 back Out you are doing 13.33 mph + 10 mph wind for 23.33 mph wind resistance Back you are doing 40 mph - 10 mph wind for 30 mph wind resistance Both ways you are fighting more net wind resistance ( 1.5 hours (((20/1.5)+10)^2) + .5 hours (((20/.5)-10)^2) ) / 2 hours (20^2) same as 3/2 * ((40/3+10)^2) + 1/4 * ((40-10)^2) / 2 * (20^2) equals 1.6 You want to hump it in and out at the same time you are going to spend about 1.6 as much work in the a 10 mph wind. 

Those cranks arms are gone/dead and need to be replaced. The pedals are steel and the crank aluminum. You should grease the threads so the metals do not fuse. 

Your first link is to the site that runs the trails and they have a trail map. baytrail.org/baytrailmap 

Buy the kit with cable and housing. Cut the housing with a proper cutter and put on the ends. Thread the cable and THEN cut the cable. If you don't want to buy a proper cutter then pay a LBS (local bike shop). 

Are you saying you can buy 1.5 - 1.75 now but they don't have 1.25 - 1.5 in stock? If so yes 1.4 is very close to 1.5. As with any install be careful not to pinch the tube when installing the tire. Fill it up to 10 psi and release pressure to relieve folds / twist. 

You did not suddenly lose air you just did not notice until you got to the cobble stone The rubber tube failed and recovered The valve failed and recovered
