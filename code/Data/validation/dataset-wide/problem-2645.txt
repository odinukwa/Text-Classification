According to Kant, causality is a human way to interpret our sensory impressions: it may not be useful or meaningful to think of it as something that exists like a Ding an sich, an objective thing independent of human interpretation. The same applies to space and time. In that line of thought, one cannot in principle establish the truth of a causal relationship, and everything is just an ordering of our impressions. 

Voltaire based this on the Italian proverb, Il meglio è l’inimico del bene, which means exactly the same. The origin of the proverb appears to be unknown. He uses the Italian phrase himself in his Art dramatique. First he describes how the work of Lulli is misinterpreted by a certain encyclopaedia of art; then he "proves" how wrong it is (if I understand the text correctly), and ends with the proverb. I don't think it could be read otherwise than Lulli being the good, and the all-too artificial encyclopaedia being the "better". Incidentally, I ask, how did Voltaire learn this proverb? He must have heard someone else use it. And either that person must have used it the same way Voltaire uses it, or Voltaire must have misunderstood. Is the latter likely? I imagine this person used it in a context that let Voltaire interpret it this way; it seems possible, but unlikely, that he misinterpreted it. Suppose there were two women, Cleopatra and Xanthippe. Suppose Cleopatra were the enemy of Xanthippe. Who would you say was more aggressive? I say we know that Cleopatra is probably aggressive, but Xanthippe might be either aggressive or merely fearful of Cleopatra. Being someone's enemy is often reciprocal, but not necessarily so. In any case, if one party is called an "enemy", emphasis lies on that party's ill will. Analogously, the better harms the good, but we aren't told whether the good harms the better as well. It seems clear that it is the harmful effect of the better that has focus, not the other way around. Moreover, the main statement is dans son état, heureux qui peut se plaire; the phrase non qu'on ne puisse augmenter en prudence etc. ("not that...") is an exception he makes. The main statement is reinforced by the evocative word chimère. What comes before non que... belongs to the main statement. Any text can be interpreted in various ways, many of which would be the opposite of what the author meant. If an author inspires you to contemplate something you know he didn't intend, that is of course fine and well—as long as you don't try and read it into his other lines. We are not Voltaire's servants: if we should like the wordplay of this expression's meaning "the good is the enemy of the better", we are free to do so. 

Conservation of matter: yes. Atoms cannot perish, and they have probably always been; Epicurus and hence Lucretius argue that the universe must always have existed, since otherwise it would have emerged out of nothing, which is to them impossible. Whenever an object is destroyed, its atoms must go somewhere; and, whenever an object is created, its atoms must come from somewhere. Similar views had been quite popular among Greek natural philosophers. Heraclitus (c. 535 – c. 475 BC) before them said it like this: 

The connection between the idea of the Good and the idea of the Triangle is that, in the physical world, there exist neither things that are perfectly good nor things that are perfect triangles. Even if you help someone, you probably do it because it gives you a pleasant feeling, or because it's just a habit, so it's not pure good. Similarly, the triangle drawn in my book is not a perfect triangle: it is ever so slightly deformed by the structure of the paper and the inaccuracy of whatever drew it. I could say, "I have this figure here in my book that looks like it has three angles, but it's ever so slightly off; I will refer to it by describing the little quirks in its outline that come closest to its actual shape". Alternatively, I could simply say, "granted, it is an imperfect triangle; but we all know what a perfect triangle would be in theory, and it's more efficient to refer to this perfect triangle when discussing mathematics rather than this imperfect drawing in my book, so I will just call it a triangle, keeping this perfect theoretical triangle in mind". The same can be applied to a good action. The concept of an ideal, perfect triangle or the perfect good can be helpful and efficient in our daily tasks. But Plato went farther: he held that their perfection makes them in a way divine. They are different from physical triangles and good behaviour in our daily lives; they're something of a higher order. That's why he postulated that these idea(l)s must exist in some way in a higher plane of existence, that they must transcend their imperfect physical copies. The fact that we, humans, could in some way touch on or even comprehend these ideas must mean that we, too, must be or have been connected with the divine. For how can we have a perfect triangle in mind if we have never seen one? A being in no way connected to the divine surely could not distil a perfect triangle out of the imperfect physical things in the temporal world. 

First it must be said that hedonism in the modern sense was not the core of Epicurism: Epicurus used the word ἡδονή (hêdonê, "pleasure") in a less obvious sense. Epicureans strove after ataraxia, "unperturbedness" of the soul: a state of mind where neither pain nor pleasure affected the soul too much. This was the highest "pleasure". Mild pain and mild pleasure were acceptable; but great pleasure was ill advised, because it would eventually end, and thus lead to longing for more, which constitutes pain. When we long for something, our heart aches. Because moderate pleasure did not compromise ataraxia, casual sex and good food were allowed. But falling in love and unhealthy gluttony led to pain and were anathema. The Stoics practised apatheia, "absence of feeling": a state of mind where the soul experiences no emotion at all. That was the only way in which the soul could be completely free. Any emotion would bind it to the body. Life is a cart pulled by dogs; you, as a dog, have a choice between struggling against it, thereby causing yourself grief, or simply running along, going neither too fast nor too slowly Any sexual escapade or other enjoyment compromised one's apatheia. In addition, even moderate pleasure could destabilize the soul, subjecting it to greater pleasure by consequence, which would ultimately end in pain. There are some similarities to Buddhism. 

[Edited:] Voltaire meant it the way you have interpreted it: you shouldn't always be looking for something better if you have something good; it's hard enough to keep what you have. Here are the relevant lines from the poem, with my translation à l'improviste: 

I agree with Cody and Dimo. I believe the key to Utilitarianism is assessing the possible outcome of your actions, and weighing their various effects as far as you reasonably can. The limits of what would still be a reasonable conclusion ("is it reasonable to conclude that two lives are worth more than one in the given case?") could be established in various ways, such as by another specific system of ethics. There will always be large unknown variables. The opposite is anything that precludes any weighing at all, such as cast-iron principles ("I will not take another's life, no matter what") or ethics solely based on intentions that are unrelated to results ("if you do it for God, it doesn't matter what you do; if you do it with the intention of pleasing God, you may kill as many as you feel is necessary"). However, it could be said, which Dimo hints at, that all ethics unwittingly work within a Utilitarian framework, rendering the term meaningless: if pleasing God is the highest goal in ethics, because that is my only moral obligation, I can weigh the results of my actions according to that model. Shall I destroy Timbuktu or not? I know God commands me to do it, and so Timbuktu's destruction is the moral thing to do. Not destroying it weight zero. Thus it would seem reasonable to include in the definition of Utilitarianism some more specific goals, like people's physical well-being as a positive weight, or the fulfilment of their desires. But even these two goals are controversial among Utilitarians. In practice, whenever I think "your decision is impractical and could profit from a more Utilitarian point of view", I just want to tell people, "think more about the practical results of your actions, instead of these mere principles; you have adopted them seemingly at random, and you are unwittingly giving them far too much weight in your narrow-minded motivation, forgetting the true purpose for which you have invented those principles in the first place". 

Foucault says what constitutes insanity is a label determined by society. Whether someone is sane or insane is not a clear, objective fact. I do not disagree. He says this labelling can be dangerous. At first glance, this all seems evident but somewhat trivial: of course it is bad to have people committed for some evil purpose, if they are merely a bit quirky but can take care of themselves well enough. Likewise, it is bad if doctors are too quick in judging someone insane. We all know this. But what did Foucault want with this? What situation was he thinking of in which his perspective could be an eye-opener, what practical use? I am probably missing some point. If you have something to add about the practical application of post-modernist sociology in general, i.e. not specifically about insanity, that would be interesting as well. 

I don't know about any attack on Rawls that is based on genetic variation leading to different proposals from behind the Veil. But I can imagine what Rawls might say. The great majority of humans share an intuitive sense of justice. There may be slight variations, but these aren't excessively large: if the great majority find a certain political system just from behind the Veil, we can count on its being just. There may be a small number of freaks who would support an unjust system, because they were born lacking this basic sense of justice; but we should just disregard them. The great majority will be just. At any rate, I believe this experiment wasn't meant as a serious, practical plan: it was just a hypothetical situation, a mind experiment. Some scientists have tried actually carrying out his experiment by taking real people who didn't know anything about political systems or actual society (I don't remember what kind of people those were: children? primitive hunters-gatherers?). They then asked them what their ideas on a just society were. But Rawls would consider this experiment useless, because his was only hypothetical and wouldn't work in practice, at least not this way. 

First, not all species are capable of breeding. How are we then to distinguish different species of bacteria? Secondly, what about a continuum of mammals, of which each animal can breed with the animals close to it in the continuum, but not with others farther off? Where are we then to set the boundary? For example, I could hypothetically breed with all of my female ancestors down to a certain time in the past, but not beyond. Should that be the point in time when my ancestors became a different species? But my ancestor X, who lived just after that time, could breed both with me and with some of her ancestors, down to our ancestor Y, etc. If all my ancestors are one species, I should be able to breed with Y's sister, which I cannot. If they are not all one species, the boundary of my species must lie somewhere between X and Y—but then, given the above, X and Y would be able to breed across species. This leads to contradictions. 

"Everything changes and nothing remains still... and... you cannot step twice into the same stream" — (Wikipedia) By this he meant that a stream is never the same because it consists of different bits of water each moment. Democritus (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC) probably inspired Epicurus a great deal with his atomism, which includes indestructible atoms that cannot be created or destroyed but have always been. Both Democritus and Epicurus/Lucretius held that there were different kinds of atoms with different shapes, which affected the properties of the objects composed of these atoms. Conservation of energy: probably not. Lucretius did not really have a concept of energy as in modern physics. Heat consisted of some kind of fire atoms, so that would probably fall under conservation of energy; but others kinds of energy, like potential energy, probably did not—or, rather, it would be better to say that he never expressed an opinion about it. The soul, which is destroyed upon the death of the body, consists of air atoms and guides the body with air. This too was a popular concept in Antiquity: ghosts, phantoms, life force, etc. are often said to be related to air and wind. Latin spiritus ("spirit, breath") comes from spiro, "to blow", as in divine breath. Animal "animal", anima "life force", and animus "mind, emotions" all come from a stem that means "breath, wind" (cf. Greek ἄνεμος /anemos/, "wind"). So perhaps the combination of air and fire atoms could be considered a semi-equivalent of energy; but there are still many other forms of energy that he simply did not consider as such, nor could air be converted into fire. If one reads the whole De Rerum Natura, the impression one gets is that Lucretius simply did not concern himself with the question of energy in the modern sense. He just assumed that atoms could move for various reasons, without mentioning energy as a separate factor. However, I have no doubt that he would have eagerly accepted the modern concept of conservation of energy once explained to him, because it would fit his other theories remarkably well. I don't know Heraclitus very well; we do not have a great deal left of his writings; and his style is rather enigmatic: however, he believed that the entire universe was somehow based on fire. It was the basic element of everything; it caused all the other elements to be. If you compare this to the the modern law of the conservation of energy and the equivalence of mass and energy, perhaps he was not too far off. But it is very hard to interpret how Heraclitus intended this primacy of fire; perhaps it is quite different.
