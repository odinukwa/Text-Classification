I think you are trying to deal with two different issues. One is how you feel about your work and team and how to handle it and the second is how to make a lateral move. At the same time it also feels like you have made up your mind to move out since you say you feel sad about working with your boss and you are desperate to move. If you have already reached that stage of desperation then do not worry about the first issue (i.e. how you are feeling isolated) and think forward. You have spent 4 years at this place and it is reasonable time to move if you decide current role is not helping you progress in your career. My point is rather than thinking (and being sad) about the issues and reasons, focus only on moving out as a . You can 

Look at long term impact on career and near term gain for you company What I mean by this is while making a decision on what to do and what not to do, important thing to figure is how is this helping the company? Do not worry how it will immediately help your career. People putting their career for every action they take is exactly what results in corporate politics and leg-pulling. If sharing data with your 'brilliant' colleagues is good for your customers and hence for your company, you should totally do that, irresecptive of what good or bad you think it will do to your career. That is your main job. Having said this, you obviously need to look out for your career and assess if it is progressing as per your ambitions or not. Ideally, doing things which are good for your company, should gain high visibility and help in career progression. Although it can very well happen that due to poor management, your actions are overseen and if you think putting company's benefit above your own has negatively impacted your career, then you probably are at the wrong place 

I am leaving a company within 6 months of joining for several reasons but main being they highly misrepresented my role/work in the company and all the work they have is far below my level. Perhaps they did not plan it and their business did not grow as fast as they wanted. However, they are very unapologetic about it. (Still paying me very high salary though!) I knew this is hurting their business and my career. So I decided to resign gracefully and help us both. I am required to give one month notice and I did that based on timing for my next job. I clearly mentioned my preferred last date in my resignation email which was close to a month. Now this company has asked me leave in 2 weeks instead of 4. I would have accepted even that if they would have requested me that nicely. What I am mad about is that they are trying to frame it as if I requested an earlier date and they are being kind enough to grant me that. (From an out of context conversation with my manager where I just verbally mentioned that "I just thought it is better to leave sooner than later"). I tried to discuss this with my HR and my manager (both face-to-face and on email) on how can they do this but the discussion is not going anywhere and already getting uncomfortable for me to handle. They are still insisting that it is as per my verbal request (which I never made.) I have always left my employers (3 total till now) in a very good note . But with this company, this incident plus the initial misleading they did during my job interview, is tempting me to not go quietly. I have three options from my point of view. 

The important thing is to take the initiative, if you show that you are willing to work and that you are not simply wasting company time then your tasks will increase again. 

As this is a question that in part regards Indian law I recommend contacting a lawyer or someone that is specialized in indian law. That being said, withholding salary and not paying it until 2 months later sounds sketchy and you could probably argue a breach of contract. Given that they are not paying you and threatening you with the labour contract I wouldn't be overly concerned about leaving smoothly, they do not appear to be serious in their dealings. I would hand in a resignation stating the last day you will be working and explicitly stating the reason you are leaving, the withholding of your payment. If you have any outstanding salary with the company you might have to drag it through court if they do not settle. 

The key here is passion, if you are applying for an example to an aircraft manufacturer that is notorious for paying little you should explain your interest not only in aircrafts and the art of flying but also how that links in with your particular skill set. It all comes down to pitching yourself as someone that could align well with the company's core values and being a person whom they believe is a good fit along with the rest of the group. Your wishes as to what a happy life might entail should be pitched to how might the company benefit from your increase in knowledge and skill. If you can find a good match between your interests and the company's values you're more likely to reach an interview than stating that money is not important to you. 

I would not recommend putting on your cover letter that money is not important for you. We all need to cover our basic expenses and we do that through monetary means, thus money sadly becomes important. Instead focus on the positive sides that the company provide. Search their webpage to find out what kinds of benefits they provide: learning, flex-time etc. and make your pitch towards that instead. 

You can always ask, but if there is a non-disclosure agreement between the agent and the company you are unlikely to receive a reply. The job agent is likely more concerned in keeping a good relation with his employer than with potential employees. If you work in a specialized field you can ask what the company produces, size etc. and try to figure out which company it is. The more general the company the harder it is to pinpoint though. There is a risk that you apply to a bad reputation company in that case you can still use the time to fine tune your CV, presentation etc. 

If the new company is paying you from 17th April, then I think you should just commit to that date and company full time and focus on whatever they need you to train yourself and prepare. If this is not occupying your full day, this could also be any opportunity to go an extra mile and do some learning/training/ on your own which can help you prepare for next job. There is a chance the new company will positively look at your commitment and help in your career growth. I just think trying to balance two corporate jobs will not do justice to either of them. Of course every situation is different, so you would have to take that call if you are able to do each job without conflicting on commitment to other. 

At this point, I think you are reading little more than there is to it but I understand your concern. 

If you can make a technical (as opposed to sales or marketing) presentation on that skill for an hour and keep people without any skills in that area interested, then I think it is okay to write that as a on your resume. Just look at YouTube videos on variety of skills. I do that for learning lot of technologies. (lately it has been IoT on Raspberry pi). The videos which have kept me engaged for an hour (or even more than 20 minutes) are people who I really think are skilled in that area. Day I can make a presentation similar to that, I would put it on my resume. It is still possible that skill is not sufficient for your job but that is something the interviewer would have to decide. You can be just be confident from your side that you are not faking it. 

You are hoping for two things out if this situation (not sign the contract and keep your job). One of them is in your hand and you should do it. That is politely decline to sign the contract. (send an email to all your managers that effect. Also offer them to help in the project as much as you can but without the contract. This paper trace may be needed for your second objective) In my opinion you should do this irrespectively because you are just not happy to sign the contract. On keeping the job, I think you have to wait and see how the situation unfolds. May be they will not let you go. May be asking you to let you go for not signing a contract is not legal in the first place. May be they will revise the contract. May be you will find a better offer in the meantime. There are just too many possibilities. 

If you use another work as an argument why you should receive an increase in your current job there is a significant risk that you will lose out. Threatning to leave if you don't get what you want, as this will be perceived, can be taken as a lack of faith in the company and a will to leave, among other. If you decide to keep working at the company your reputation and relation with your superiors will likely be soured. A company is primarily interested in what you can bring to them in term of experience, output etc. If you are a key-member with special knowledge, skills etc. that are key in order for the company to continue and not come to a grinding halt, yes then maybe that would be a valid tactic. Once. Creating that kind of bus-factor is a sure way of being replaced or made obsolete, but there are scores of questions that can tell you more on that. TLDR: Being a rank and file employee this will most likely not work, and any threat you make that you don't carry through will harm your reputation and will damage your relation with the company. 

When working for a producing company it is often seen as detrimental to favour a competitor's product while on the job even if you only wish for some variety. What you prefer in your freetime is something entirely different, that is and should be of no concern to the company. That being said, appearance is important in the corporate game and outside of it. Imagine what effect it would have on the company if the manager/CEO openly favoured the competitors product in front of employees or customers. It could be interpreted as if there was no faith in the product with loss of morale in employees and customers openly questioning the quality of the product. 

Thereby you are politely declining at the same time as you are showing that you have an interest in hanging out with him. It also allows you to plan your time. Being straight-forward with the chap and telling him that you think he is too pushy might back-fire and spoil an otherwise good working relationship. 

Edit As it has been pointed out in the comments below, it is presumptious to assume that someone is working in a code environment. Given the nature of many questions it is an easy mistake to make, the answer has been corrected to be more general. 

No, the "luck" is there, you are choosing not to take that advancement because of the associated baggage. 

Footnote: Personally I'd like it if the term engineer was reserved in the way it appears to be in Germany, for example. However the reality is that the origins of the word and (one or more of) its current meaning(s) in the UK are much less exalted. 

If the job is something like processing payments, it is probably a well-known money-laundering or similar scam. I would independently look up the phone number for the company (ignore what the interviewer gave you). Phone them and ask to speak to HR. I would explain the situation and ask them if they can confirm the job offer over the phone - and in writing too. Never phone from a landline directly after receiving a call from the interviewer, they can hold the line open and pretend to be whoever (e.g. a bank or an employer) they told you to phone. Use a different phone or call a relative or friend whose voice you recognise first, then make the important calls after 30 minutes. Never forget that a check can bounce weeks after it is credited to your account (after it appears to have "cleared") - you will be left owing the bank money. The people who sold you the special software they say you need, are the ones who benefit from this sort of scam. 

Countless people have faced that choice. Sometimes in life you can't have everything you want at the same time. 

Not relevant. In the UK, the term engineer isn't reserved for people with specific academic qualifications. 

No, in some situations an engineer is just someone who shovels coal into locomotives for a living, not someone who designs new types of locomotive. In the UK, it is commonplace for job titles to be fairly meaningless, especially in IT. Job titles sometimes seem to be a sort of aspirational nonsense used in place of money as a motivational pat on the back. Job titles don't cost shareholders anything. 

No. You need to distinguish between a plateau, a local apex and a terminus. You could terminate your career and do something else, possibly something more rewarding (financially or otherwise) but that would be your choice. 

Well that viewpoint is a mistake. For example, some scientists do their best, most notable work, in their early career. History is full of people who are remembered only for what they did while young. There seems to be two things you want and you simply have to choose.
