It is not that uncommon for candidates to back out of an interview after attending the first few rounds. This usually happens because they accepted an offer with another company. However, a candidate choosing to stay at his current company is also not unusual. The hiring manager (or recruiter) also understands this as a "part of the game", and it isn't something you should worry much about. I have myself done this about a year ago, and I sent them a mail worded (roughly) as below. 

Don't publicly humiliate anyone. Just don't do it. Tarring and feathering anyone for any reason is not only unprofessional, but also unethical. One of the worst things you could possibly do to another human being is violation of human dignity. Moreover, no dignified person would "enjoy" this kind of public humiliation of another person, or in other words, they don't want this level of "transparency". In addition, in the workplace context, public humiliation of an "underperforming" team member will intimidate other employees (because they now know what will happen to them if they too should underperform in future). This will create a hostile work environment and even tarnish the company's reputation. Just to drive home the point further, let me suggest you organize a send-off for him like you would for anyone else leaving the team with one important difference: everyone has to say bad things about the person leaving, and perhaps sign a card for him with some kind words on why he sucks. You surely realize how absurd (and embarrassing) that sounds, and you can guess what your other team members will think of this idea. To summarize: Don't publicly humiliate anyone. Just don't do it. Moving on, one month seems too short a time frame to conclude that a person is underperforming and needs to be kicked out. All days are not equal, people go through highs and lows in both personal and professional life. It could be an unfortunate coincidence that one of his lows occurred right after starting a new job. Personally, I would give my "underperforming" team members a longer rope, and possibly work with them to bring them back on track. Nonetheless, in case I forgot: Don't publicly humiliate anyone. Just don't do it. 

If they apply for a job at your company, you can reject their application for providing false data. This also holds if you work for another company in future, and they apply there. If a background checking agency (hired by their prospective employer) asks you to verify their employment, you can inform them of the discrepancy in an objective manner, such as below: 

I am employed by a consulting company (let's call them Initech), and have been deputed to work for a client (call them Acme). I have been working out of Acme's office, almost since the time Initech hired me. I am the only Initech employee working for Acme (other Initech employees work for other companies). I have now resigned from Initech, and would be leaving them in about a week's time. At my previous jobs, I have sent a "goodbye" mail to my colleagues on the last day as a custom/etiquette (which I believe is quite prevalent anyway). This is, however, my first job as a consultant, and I am in a predicament. It doesn't feel right to "just pack your stuff and leave" without sending the goodbye email. There isn't anyone at Initech whom I could send this mail to, since the only people with whom I have had some interaction are my manager (whom I am going to thank separately anyway), and 3 guys who interviewed me (all of whom have already left Initech). All my work relationships on this job have been with Acme's employees. However, I am not sure if sending such emails to a client's employees is considered good etiquette. I don't want to bother my Initech manager with this question, he certainly wouldn't bother either way. 

Do not call out the employee's lies, just state the facts and be done with. Let the background checker and the prospective employer figure out how to deal with the discrepancy. Stay professional even when others behave unprofessionally. 

and pretend to wait until he "notes it down". Then continue talking. If he doesn't "note it down" and instead continues talking, repeat your instruction with a stoic expression: 

I would say just let it go. Nobody expects you to write a flawless program in one go, especially in half an hour. In a live scenario, you would get multiple opportunities to test your code and refactor or rewrite it. Hence, an interviewer is unlikely to hold the mistake against you, if your reasoning was mostly okay. If the mistake was something really basic that you missed, then sending the email now doesn't help much. The interviewer wouldn't really change his/her impression because you realized it after the interview. ("I can't believe he missed something so basic, but okay, at least he realized it later, so it is fine, I guess!") The fact that you are sending the mail to the hiring manager and not the interviewer, is even more reason for you to not mention it. The hiring manager isn't going to run down the hallway into the interviewer's office exclaiming, "Hey look, that guy is awesome, he pointed out a flaw in his code!" :) 

If you work more or less independently, you could offer to work on weekends in return for leaves on weekdays, during which you could attend interviews. If you have already resigned, and unless your manager is a complete jerk, he/she would understand that you need to attend interviews to get another job. 

Disappointing as it might sound to you, this is of no consequence. Your employer is one who pays your salary or wages, whether they instruct you to work, or ask you to take instructions from the client, or even keep you idle has no relevance. 

Then let the PM take the call, do as he says, and move on to the next issue/work item. There is nothing to be gained from doing a song and dance about your coworker forgetting to update the bugtracker. 

I have been in a situation similar to what you have described, and would like to offer some insights which would hopefully help. 

This would give X the right message, that you are not obliged to help X work around his ego issue with Y. He will have to deal with it himself. That said though, in this case, I honestly don't see any problem with telling X that he is an adult professional and should behave like one. 

Violation of Contract: Your company's contract with the other company may have specified a SLA (service-level agreement) or other communication protocol to be followed for all communication. While unofficial channels are usually much more efficient to get the work done, violation of a contract is usually a lot of trouble to deal with. Unreliable communication: It is a huge risk to your client's project if the only interface with the other company is you and your friend. Their project could slow down to a crawl or even grind to a halt if either of you is unavailable. Since the work is getting done and clients are not complaining, your manager probably doesn't know (or care enough) at this point how the work is getting done. By letting your manager know that you are using unofficial contacts, you give him a chance to plan for such situations. Bypassing metrics: Management loves to track "metrics", especially in deals with other companies. Using personal contacts prevents them from getting the metrics they might be interested in. During an audit or at the end of the project, they might be "pleasantly surprised" to know that they have raised zero issues with the other company, which is misleading. Dealing with problems: It is possible that your friend could give you wrong contact information, or that the contact suggested by him creates some issues for the client. Dealing with client complaints are a part of manager's job, but they cannot do it effectively if they have no idea what is going on.
