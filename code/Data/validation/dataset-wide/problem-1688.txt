Even if you do use an IP address, SNI will be used anyway, for all s which are ing on the same IP address. 

For developing a new project from scratch, I would go with 5.4. It will have a much longer shelf life than 5.3 or prior versions. For deploying an existing project, including any open source PHP code you downloaded from the Internet, I would use PHP 5.3. The reason for this is that 5.4 has a few places where backward compatibility was broken, and some existing PHP scripts will need updating to be compatible with 5.4. In a few cases, the package would have to be completely refactored to work with 5.4. See the PHP 5.4 migration guide for all the gory details. 

On that note, you really should not try to use the same server for multiple purposes. If you want to run a Zabbix server, run only the Zabbix server (and any services it needs to operate, such as Apache). Don't try to make it your Zabbix server, email server, general web site, VPN endpoint, and the kitchen sink. 

Set your Asterisk Extension in your vtiger User Preferences. See the vtiger wiki for complete configuration instructions. 

The easiest thing to do is to mount your new disk at and save yourself a lot of trouble. This way you don't have to worry about altering SELinux policies or any of that. 

Zabbix monitors itself by default. If it's up, it will have data; if not, it won't. Look for the gap in the data. 

Fedora does not include any blocks for server status, so any that exist were put there by you or another application you installed. Remove all of the blocks that you set up for this, and then reload Apache. 

Create new instances with the public key, and then use Ansible's authorized_keys module to distribute any additional public keys you want to access your instance with, such as the corresponding public key for . 

Based on the close correlation between the traffic stats on the staging and production servers, it appears your two servers are talking to each other. Port 625 is a management port used by Apple products. From your netstat, it appears that one machine (.19) is connecting to the other (.18) on port 625. From some Google searches, it appears that Mac OS X uses port 625 for Workgroup Manager (which was replaced in Mountain Lion with Profile Manager). It also appears that a wide variety of other machines on the Internet are connecting to port 625 as well, probably as break-in attempts. You should firewall your server as soon as possible to prevent intrusion. 

This recommendation has been relaxed somewhat with RFC 7231, which merely says (for both 301 and 302): 

Your gateway is wrong in your guest. Since you bridged your network connection, it is as if the VM is on the same subnet (LAN) as the host. Thus it needs to use the same gateway address as the host. 

Since the listed abuse contact for 24.223.0.82 is and it seems to be PI address space, I'd suggest just blackholing them, unless you actually know who this company is. In that case, you should call them and find the right person to yell at. 

Your probably differs between your normal user and the root user, likely missing directories such as and/or where administrative utilities like normally live. 

The line you are referring to allows all traffic on the interface (localhost). It is generally harmless, and removing it can cause problems. The interface columns are only visible after you add to your command. 

The 0078 error indicates a communication problem. This could be caused by bad cables, a failed connector, or SATA III drives. 

It's not the process name you need to adjust, but your tool. Press c while is running, or just start it with to see full command lines. For example, without : 

You can generally ignore this message, as long as the PHP MySQL library version is lower than the MySQL version, and they are both the same major version (here, 5). 

It's 2013 and there's virtually no good reason to disable APIC, and plenty of good reason to enable it. This may not have been true 15 years ago when APIC was new and not well implemented by various hardware vendors, but that hasn't been the case for a very long time. Microsoft's explanation (from 2003!) is probably the best I can give you, and I'm surprised you didn't find it since it was linked from Wikipedia's page on APIC. In essence, APIC is a dramatic improvement over the old PC interrupt system which dates back to the 1980s, allowing for more interrupts and less interrupt sharing. This translates into better performance and the ability to use more peripheral devices, both of which are true whether the machine is physical or virtual. Rule of thumb is: APIC should always be enabled unless there's a specific reason to disable it, such as using ancient hardware, or virtualizing an old NT/2000 system with a non-APIC HAL. 

You can try tuning TCP keepalive to much shorter values. By default a connection can be idle for two hours before keepalive kicks in. Exactly what values you should use is really dependent on what your application does and what your users expect or how they interact with it. 

When I went to inspect the original, I found it indeed did have a date of Feb 21. Where you got the cached file you have, I could not begin to say. To resolve the issue, clear your yum cache. 

You aren't doing anything wrong. The VNC protocol specifies that the "port" isn't actually a port, but an offset from 5900, the default VNC port. Thus would connect to port 5900, would connect to port 5901, etc. 

The obvious thing is to make sure that your WAN router, whatever it is, is sending inbound port 80 traffic to the server you want. 

Very few changes to postfix configuration require a full restart. It's almost always sufficient to have postfix reload its configuration while still running. 

Use in your to get the actual host that the client sent. You can also use that variable in directives to split your logs by hostname. 

We accept DHCPv6 traffic. If you use stateless autoconfiguration, or statically configure your machines, this is not necessary. 

There's no such host as . You've gotten invalid information from GoDaddy or somewhere. Ask them to give you the correct hostname. I would guess it will be and that you put it in backward. That is a valid host. 

I checked the repo and it appears correct. However, your package list doesn't look right. Specifically: 

The directive is meant to specify the IP addresses on that same system to which MongoDB listens for connections, not IP addresses from which it receives connections.
