Here are the details. Let $L_p\cong\mathbb{P}^1$ be a line in $\mathbb{P}^2$ through $p$. Your exact sequence restricted to $L_p$ yields the following exact sequence $$0\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(1)\rightarrow\mathcal{E}_{|L_p}\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-2)\rightarrow 0 $$ and hence $\mathcal{E}_{|L_p}\cong\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(1)\oplus\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-2)$. Therefore, $\pi^{-1}(L_p) = \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(1)\oplus\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-2))$ is the Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{F}_3$. Let $\overline{\xi}$ be the class of the only curve with self-intersection $-3$ on $\mathbb{F}_3$, and let $f$ be the class of a fiber of $\pi_{|\mathbb{F}_3}:\mathbb{F}_3\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^1$. Then if $\widetilde{H} = \pi^{*}\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2}(1)$ and $\xi = c_1(\mathcal{O}_X(1))$ we have $\widetilde{H}_{|\mathbb{F}_3} = f$ and $\xi_{|\mathbb{F}_3} = f+\overline{\xi}$. Since $c_1(\mathcal{E})=-1$ and $c_2(\mathcal{E}) = 1$ the canonical divisor of $X$ is given by $-K_X = 4\widetilde{H}+2\xi$ and we may compute the intersection $-K_W\cdot\overline{\xi}$ inside $\mathbb{F}_3$, that is $$-K_X\cdot\overline{\xi} = (4\widetilde{H}+2\xi)_{|\mathbb{F}_3}\cdot\overline{\xi} = (4f+2(f+\overline{\xi}))\cdot\overline{\xi} = (6f+2\xi) = 6+2(-3) = 0.$$ 

A line bundle $L$ on a complex manifold is positive if there is an Hermitian metric $h$ on $L$ such that $\frac{1}{2\pi}\Theta(L,h)$ is a Kahler form. By Kodaira's embedding theorem if $L$ is a positive line bundle on a compact Kahler manifold the $L^{\otimes m}$ induces an embedding $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^n$ for some $m>0$ and $L^{\otimes m} = f^*\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(1)$. Therefore $L$ is ample. Conversely if such an embedding exists the pullback of the Fubini-Study metric on $*\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(1)$ determine a positive metric on $L^{\otimes m}$ and hence on $L$. Similarly, if $L$ has an Hermitian metric such that $c_1(L) = \frac{i}{2\pi}\Theta(L,h)$ is non-negative then $L$ is nef. On the other hand it could happen that a nef bundle does not have such a metric, see for instance Example $1.7$ in this paper $URL$ If $\omega$ is a Kahler form on $X$, then $L$ is nef if and only if for any $\epsilon >0%$ there is an Hermitian metric $h_\epsilon$ on $L$ such that $\frac{i}{2\pi}\Theta(L,h_\epsilon)>-\epsilon \omega$. Note that a compact Kahler manifold may not contain any curve. However, in this way one can define nefness on any compact Kahler manifold. 

In the case $n=4$, $k=2$, one can perform an explicit computation in charts of the blow-up. Consider the quadric $Q$ defined by $$\{x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=0\}\subset\mathbb{A}^4.$$ The singular line is given by $L={x_1=x_2=x_3 = 0}$. Let us consider the points $p = (0,0,0,0)$ and $q = (0,0,0,1)$ on $L$. We can look at a local chart of the blow-up $Bl_{p,q}\mathbb{A}^4$ in $\mathbb{A}^4\times\mathbb{A}^3\times\mathbb{A}^3\cong\mathbb{A}^{10}$. We will see that the strict transform $\widetilde{Q}$ of $Q$ is still singular along the strict transform $\widetilde{L}$ of $L$. Therefore $\widetilde{L}$ is a double curve for $\widetilde{Q}$. You can see this from the following MacAulay2 script. In higher dimension I am pretty sure that things go this way as well. 

For curves of degree one you could look at Section 2.4 of Debarre's book "Higher dimensional algebraic geometry". Section 2.14 for Fermat hypersurfaces. More generally for low degree rational curves: For hypersurfaces: $URL$ For conic connected varieties: $URL$ For conics in complete intersections: $URL$ For arbitrary projective varieties: $URL$ 

Let $S$ be a surface and $Z=\{p_1,...,p_n\}\subset S$ be a reduced subscheme of dimension zero. Let $\epsilon:\widetilde{S}\rightarrow S$ be the blow-up of $S$ at $Z$. Consider the exact sequence $$0\mapsto \epsilon^{*}\Omega_{S}\rightarrow \Omega_{\widetilde{S}}\rightarrow i_{*}\Omega_{E/Z}\mapsto 0$$ where $i:E\hookrightarrow\widetilde{S}$ is the exceptional divisor. Note that $\mathcal{H}om(i_{*}\Omega_{E/Z},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{S}}) = 0$ and by Grothendieck duality $\mathcal{E}xt^{1}(i_{*}\Omega_{E/Z},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{S}})\cong i_{*}T_{E/Z}(E)$. So dualizing the above exact sequence we get $$0\mapsto T_{\widetilde{S}}\rightarrow \epsilon^{*}T_{S}\rightarrow i_{*}T_{E/Z}(E)\mapsto 0.$$ Since $R^{1}\epsilon_{*}T_{\widetilde{S}} = 0$ we have $$0\mapsto\epsilon_{*}T_{\widetilde{S}}\rightarrow T_{S}\rightarrow T_{S|Z}\mapsto 0.$$ Now, $R^{i}\epsilon_{*}T_{\widetilde{S}} = 0$ for any $i > 0$. So $H^{i}(\widetilde{S},T_{\widetilde{S}})\cong H^{i}(S,\epsilon_{*}T_{\widetilde{S}})$ for any $i\geq 0$ and we get the following exact sequence in cohomology $$ \begin{array}{l} 0\mapsto H^{0}(\widetilde{S},T_{\widetilde{S}})\rightarrow H^{0}(S,T_S)\rightarrow K^{2n}\rightarrow H^{1}(\widetilde{S},T_{\widetilde{S}})\rightarrow H^{1}(S,T_S)\rightarrow 0 \rightarrow \\ \rightarrow H^{2}(\widetilde{S},T_{\widetilde{S}})\rightarrow H^{2}(S,T_S)\rightarrow 0\\ \end{array} $$ Since the map between the tangent spaces $H^{1}(\widetilde{S},T_{\widetilde{S}})\rightarrow H^{1}(S,T_S)$ is surjective and the map between the obstruction spaces $H^{2}(S,\epsilon_{*}T_{\widetilde{S}})\rightarrow H^{2}(S,T_S)$ is injective the map $Def_{\widetilde{S}}\rightarrow Def_S$ is smooth of relative dimension $2n-\dim H^{0}(S,T_S) + \dim H^{0}(\widetilde{S},T_{\widetilde{S}})$. This means that the obstructions to deforming $\widetilde{S}$ are exactly the obstructions to deforming $S$. The vector space $K^{2n}$ parametrizes the deformations of $Z$ inside $S$ and the spaces $H^{0}(\widetilde{S},T_{\widetilde{S}})$, $H^{0}(S,T_S)$ parametrize the infinitesimal automorphisms of $\widetilde{S}$ and $S$ respectively. If the map $$H^{0}(S,T_S)\rightarrow K^{2n}$$ is surjective then $H^{1}(\widetilde{S},T_{\widetilde{S}})\cong H^{1}(S,T_S)$ and the deformations of $\widetilde{S}$ are induced by deformations of $S$. Otherwise the deformations of $Z$ inside $S$ induce non-trivial deformations of $\widetilde{S}$. For instance, take $S = \mathbb{P}^{2}$. Then $H^{0}(S,T_S)\cong T_{Id}Aut(\mathbb{P}^{2})$ has dimension $8$. If $n\leq 4$ the map $$T_{Id}Aut(\mathbb{P}^{2})\rightarrow K^{2n}$$ is surjective and $H^{1}(\widetilde{S},T_{\widetilde{S}})\cong H^{1}(\mathbb{P}^{2},T_{\mathbb{P}^{2}})$. Indeed if $n\leq 4$ there is an automorphism mapping $Z$ to any other set of $n$ points in general position and moving $Z$ inside $\mathbb{P}^{2}$ just induces trivial deformations of $\widetilde{S}$. Furthermore, since $\mathbb{P}^{2}$ itself is rigid we have $H^{1}(\mathbb{P}^{2},T_{\mathbb{P}^{2}})=0$. More generally, let $X$ be a smooth variety and $Z\subseteq X$ be a smooth subvariety. Then $$T^{1}Def_{(X,Z)} = H^{1}(X,T_{X}(-log (Z))) = H^{1}(Bl_{Z}X,T_{Bl_{Z}X}) = T^{1}Def_{Bl_{Z}X}.$$ 

The nef cone of $X_r^n$ is particularly well behaved when $X_r^n$ is a Mori dream space. In this case it has a nice decomposition made of the nef cones coming from its small $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial modifications. It is known that. 

In general if $X\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ is a smooth complete intersection of hypersurfaces of degree $d_1,...,d_c$. Then $\omega_{X}\cong\mathcal{O}_{X}(d_1+...+d_c-N-1)$. In you case $d = 5, N=4$. So $\omega_{X}\cong\mathcal{O}_{X}$ and $X$ is Calabi-Yau. To prove this formula you have to use the adjunction formula: $URL$ If $Y\subset X$ is a smooth subvariety of codimension one then $K_Y = (K_X+Y)_{|Y}$. If $Y$ is an hypersurface of degree $d$ in $X = \mathbb{P}^{N}$, then $K_Y = (d-N-1)H_{|Y}$ where $H$ is the hyperplane section. Here I am using $\omega_{\mathbb{P}^N}\cong\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^N}(-N-1)$. To prove the formula for complete intersections just proceed by induction. In general any smooth hypersurface $X\subset\mathbb{P}^{N}$ of degree $N+1$ is Calabi-Yau. Just for sake of completeness. If $X\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ is a smooth complete intersection of hypersurfaces of degree $d_1,...,d_c$ one can consider $Y = H_{d_1}\cap H_{d_2}\cap...\cap H_{d_{c-1}}$. Then $Y$ is a complete intersection of codimension $c-1$ and $X\subset Y$. One may consider the exact sequence $$0\mapsto N_{X/Y}\rightarrow N_{X/\mathbb{P}^N}\rightarrow N_{Y/\mathbb{P}^N|X}\mapsto 0.$$ Now, $X$ is a smooth divisor in $Y$ cut out by an equation of degree $d_c$. Therefore $\mathcal{I}_{X/Y}=\mathcal{O}_{Y}(-d_c)$ and $N_{X/Y} = \mathcal{O}_{X}(d_c)$. By induction we assume that $N_{Y/\mathbb{P}^N} = (\mathcal{O}_{Y}(d_1)\oplus...\oplus \mathcal{O}_{Y}(d_{c-1}))_{|X} = \mathcal{O}_{X}(d_1)\oplus...\oplus \mathcal{O}_{X}(d_{c-1})$. Now, the above exact sequence clearly splits, and we get $$N_{X/\mathbb{P}^N} = \mathcal{O}_{X}(d_1)\oplus...\oplus \mathcal{O}_{X}(d_c).$$ In particular if $X\subset\mathbb{P}^4$ is a quintic $3$-fold we have $N_{X/\mathbb{P}^4} = \mathcal{O}_{X}(5)$. Now, we may use the adjunction formula (Proposition $8.10$, pag. $182$, in Hartshorne). We have $$\omega_{X}\cong \omega_{\mathbb{P}^N}\otimes \bigwedge^{c}N_{X/\mathbb{P}^{n}}\cong \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^N}(-N-1)\otimes \mathcal{O}_X(d_1+...+d_c)\cong \mathcal{O}_X(d_1+...+d_c-N-1).$$ 

The curve you constructed $tF+(1-t)G$ is just the line through $F$ and $G$. Assuming that one could do a similar construction it would mean that $M$ is rationally connected. Let say that your veriety $X$ is embedded in $\mathbb{P}^n$ and the degree $d$ is given by the hyperplane section of $\mathbb{P}^n$. Take a smooth quadric $Q\subset\mathbb{P}^3$ and $d = 1$. There are two families of lines in $Q$. Each one is parametrized by a conic in the Grasmannian $\mathbb{G}(1,3)\subset\mathbb{P}^5$. There two conics lie in complementary planes in $\mathbb{P}^5$. In particular the two conics does not intersect and $M$ is not connected. If $X\subset\mathbb{P}^3$ is a general smooth cubic and $d = 1$. Then $M$ is just a set of twenty-seven points. Therefore it is not connected. 

The condition you need is the following. Take two points in the singular locus $x,y\in S$. Assume that the multiplicities $m_x,m_y$ of $x,y$ as points of $X$ satisfy $m_x+m_y > deg(X)$ then the line $L_{x,y}:=\left\langle x,y\right\rangle$ is contained in $X$. Indeed the intersection $L\cdot X\geq m_x+m_y > deg(X)$ implies, by Bezout's theorem, $L_{x,y}\subset X$. Take $X$ an hypersurface of degree $d$ with a points $x\in X$ of multiplicty $d$. For any other point $y\neq x$ in $X$ we have $$L_{x,y}\cdot X\geq d+1 >d.$$ Then any line through $x$ and any other point of $X$ is contained in $X$, and $X$ is a cone of vertex $x$ over an hypersurface $Y\subset\mathbb{P}^{n-1}\subset\mathbb{P}^n$ of degree $d$. In your case $d = 3,m_x = m_y = 2$, and $m_x+m_y = 4 >d$. Indeed an irreducibile cubic surface $X\subset\mathbb{P}^3$ can have at most $4$ nodes. In this case any of the $6$ lines spanned by two of the nodes is contained in $X$. 

$D-\frac{1}{k}N$ ample for any $k\gg 0$, that is $D-\epsilon N$ ample for any $0<\epsilon\ll 1$ ample, implies that $D$ is nef. This is because $Nef(X)$ is the closure of $Amp(X)$. If $C$ is an irreducible effective curve then $(D-\epsilon N)\cdot C = D\cdot C-\epsilon N\cdot C >0$. Therefore $D\cdot C>\epsilon N\cdot C$ for any $0<\epsilon\ll 1$, that is $D\cdot C\geq 0$, and $D$ is nef. On the other hand $D-\epsilon N$ for some $\epsilon >0$ implies that $D$ is big by Corollary 2.2.7 of Lazarsfeld, Positivity in Algebraic Geometry I. Nowever $D$ is not nef in general. For instance, let us consider $X = \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}\oplus \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-3))$. The anti-canonical divisor is $-K_{X}=2C_0+(e+2)F$, where $C_0$ is the section and $F$ is the fiber. Now, if $\frac{1}{3}<\epsilon < 2$ then $$D:=-K_{X}-\epsilon C_0 = (2-\epsilon)C_0+(e+2)F$$ is ample. Indeed the cone of curves is generated by $C_0$ and $F$. We have $D\cdot C_0 = 3\epsilon -1 > 0$ because $\epsilon >\frac{1}{3}$, and $D\cdot F = 2-\epsilon >0$ because $\epsilon < 2$. However, $-K_{X}\cdot C_0 = -1$, and $-K_X$ is not nef. By the way, this construction works with $X = \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}\oplus \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-e))$ for any $e\geq 3$. 

I just would like to remark that many important spectral sequences are particular cases of the Grothendieck spectral sequence for derived functor of the composition of two functor. For instance the Leray spectral sequence and the exact sequence of low degrees. Let $$E_{2}^{h,k} \Longrightarrow H^{n}(A)$$ be a spectral sequence whose terms are non trivial only for $h,k \geq 0$. Then we have $$0\mapsto E^{1,0}_{2}\rightarrow H^{1}(A) \rightarrow E^{0,1}_{2} \rightarrow E^{2,0}_{2} \rightarrow H^{2}(A).$$ Let $\mathcal{F}:\mathcal{C}_{1}\rightarrow \mathcal{C}_{2}$ and $\mathcal{G}:\mathcal{C}_{2}\rightarrow \mathcal{C}_{3}$ be two additive covariant functors between abelian categories. Suppose that $\mathcal{G}$ is left exact and that $\mathcal{F}$ takes injective objects of $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ in $\mathcal{G}$-acyclic objects of $\mathcal{C}_{2}$. Then there exists a spectral sequence (Grothendieck spectral sequence) for any object $A$ of $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ $$E_{2}^{h,k} = (R^{h}\mathcal{G}\circ R^{k}\mathcal{F})(A) \Longrightarrow R^{h+k}(\mathcal{G}\circ \mathcal{F})(A).$$ The corresponding exact sequence of low degrees is the following $$0\mapsto R^{1}\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{F}(A)) \rightarrow R^{1}(\mathcal{G}\mathcal{F}(A)) \rightarrow \mathcal{G}(R^{1}\mathcal{F}(A)) \rightarrow R^{2}\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{F}(A)) \rightarrow R^{2}(\mathcal{G}\mathcal{F})(A).$$ As a special case of the Grothendieck spectral sequence we get the Leray spectral sequence. Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a continuous map between topological spaces. We take $\mathcal{C}_{1} = \mathfrak{Ab}(X)$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2} = \mathfrak{Ab}(Y)$ to be the categories of sheaves of abelian groups over $X$ and $Y$ respectively. Then we take $\mathcal{F}$ to be the direct image functor $f_{*}:\mathfrak{Ab}(X)\rightarrow \mathfrak{Ab}(Y)$ and $\mathcal{G} = \Gamma_{Y}:\mathfrak{Ab}(Y) \rightarrow \mathfrak{Ab}$ to be the global section functor, where $\mathfrak{Ab}$ is the category of abelian groups. Note that $$\Gamma_{Y}\circ f_{*} = \Gamma_{X}:\mathfrak{Ab}(X) \rightarrow \mathfrak{Ab}$$ is the global section functor on $X$. By Grothendieck's spectral sequence we know that $(R^{h}\Gamma_{Y}\circ R^{k}f_{*})(\mathcal{E}) \Longrightarrow R^{h+k}(\Gamma_{Y}\circ f_{*})(\mathcal{E}) = R^{h+k}\Gamma_{X}(\mathcal{E})$ for any $\mathcal{E} \in \mathfrak{Ab}(X)$, that is $$H^{h}(Y,R^{k}f_{*}\mathcal{E}) \Longrightarrow H^{h+k}(X,\mathcal{E}).$$ The exact sequence of low degrees looks like $$0\mapsto H^{1}(Y,f_{*}\mathcal{E})\rightarrow H^{1}(X,\mathcal{E})\rightarrow H^{0}(Y,R^{1}f_{*}\mathcal{E}) \rightarrow H^{2}(Y,f_{*}\mathcal{E})\rightarrow H^{2}(X,\mathcal{E}).$$ Finally we can work out the local to global spectral sequence of Ext functors. Let $\mathcal{E} \in \mathfrak{Coh}(X)$ be a coherent sheaf on a scheme $X$. Consider the functor $$\mathcal{H}om(\mathcal{E},-):\mathfrak{Coh}(X) \rightarrow \mathfrak{Coh}(X), \: \mathcal{Q}\mapsto \mathcal{H}om(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{Q}),$$ and the global section functor $$\Gamma_{X}:\mathfrak{Coh}(X) \rightarrow \mathfrak{Ab}, \: \mathcal{Q}\mapsto \Gamma_{X}(\mathcal{Q}).$$ Note that $\Gamma_{X}\circ \mathcal{H}om(\mathcal{E},-) = Hom(\mathcal{E},-)$. By Grothendieck spectral sequence we have $(R^{h}\Gamma_{X}\circ R^{k}\mathcal{H}om(\mathcal{E},-))(\mathcal{Q}) \Longrightarrow R^{h+k}(Hom(\mathcal{E},-)(\mathcal{Q})$ for any $\mathcal{Q}\in \mathfrak{Coh}(X)$, that is $$H^{h}(X,\mathcal{E}xt^{k}(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{Q})) \Longrightarrow Ext^{h+k}(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{Q}).$$ The corresponding sequence of low degrees is $$0\mapsto H^{1}(X,\mathcal{H}om(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{Q})) \rightarrow Ext^{1}(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{Q}) \rightarrow H^{0}(X,\mathcal{E}xt^{1}(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{Q}))\rightarrow H^{2}(X,\mathcal{H}om(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{Q})) \rightarrow Ext^{2}(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{Q}).$$ 

If $\mathcal{O}_X(P_0)$ is very ample then it induce an embedding $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{P}(H^{0}(X,\mathcal{O}_X(P_0))\cong\mathbb{P}^n$. Therefore $n\geq 2$ and $h^{0}((X,\mathcal{O}_X(P_0)))\geq 3$. Now, $h^{0}((X,\mathcal{O}_X(P_0)))\geq 3$ implies that there exists an effective divisor $Q$ linearly equivalent to $P_0$. In particular $P_0-Q$ is the divisor of a rational function $g = \frac{p}{q}$ on $X$. The rational map $$\phi:X\dashrightarrow\mathbb{P}^1,\: x\mapsto [p(x):q(x)]$$ is birational. This implies that $X$ is rational. A contradiction because $g(X) = 1$. Roughly speaking we are saying here that if a divisor of degree one on a curve $X$ is very ample then the curve $X$ is mapped to a curve of degree one ($deg(P_0) = 1$) in a projective space, that is a line. Therefore $g(X) = 0$. In this way you get the following. Let $X$ be a curve and $P_0\in X$ be a point. Then $\mathcal{O}_X(P_0)$ is very ample if and only if $g(X) = 0$. From the first part of the argument you see that $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ very ample imply $h^{0}((X,\mathcal{O}_X(D)))\geq 3$. You may use Riemann-Roch theorem (pag 294) with $D = P_0$. In this case $deg(K_X-P_0) = 2g-2-1 = -1$. Then $P_0$ is non-special and $h^{1}(X,\mathcal{O}_X(P_0)) = 0$. By Riemann-Roch yu get $$\chi(\mathcal{O}_X(P_0)) = h^0(\mathcal{O}_X(P_0)) = deg(P_0)-g+1 = 1.$$ Again you find a contradiction. In general, a divisor $D$ on a curve $X$ is ample if and only if $deg(D)>0$. If $g(X) = 0$ then $D$ is ample if and only if it is very ample if and only if $deg(D)>0$. However, if $g(X)=1$ then $D$ is very ample if and only if $deg(D)\geq 3$. Indeed, by Riemann-Roch, $deg(D)\leq 2$ implies $h^{0}(X,\mathcal{O}_X(D)) = deg(D)\leq 2$. Therefore the morphism induced by $D$ can not be an embedding. On the other hand if $deg(D)\geq 3\geq 2g+1$ then $D$ is very ample. 

In your example it seems that you are identifying the Hilbert scheme $H$ of conics in $G(2,4)$ with $G(3,6)$. There is a morphism from $H$ to $G(3,6)$ mapping a conic $C$ to the plane spanned by $C$. However, there are planes contained in $G(2,4)$. If $L$ is the locus in $G(3,6)$ parametrizing planes contained in $G(2,4)$, then you have a description of $H$ as the blow-up of $G(3,6)$ along $L$. In general there is quite a nice scheme parametrizing rational curves in $G(k,n)$: the moduli space of stable maps $\overline{M}_{0,0}(G(k,n),d)$ parametrizing rational curves of degree $d$ in $G(k,n)$. Since you are interested in curves of genus zero in a homogeneous variety this space is an irreducible scheme with rational quotient singularities. Many things about $\overline{M}_{0,0}(G(k,n),d)$ are know. For instance the generators of its Picard group. You may look at: $URL$ and $URL$ 

As Sasha proved the general Pfaffian is smooth. On the other hand the special Pfaffian $X$ you wrote is an irreducible hypersurface of degree $6$ in $\mathbb{P}^4$ singular along a smooth curve $C$ of degree $20$ and genus $26$. Indeed $X$ has ordinary double points along $C$. Your Pfaffian is indeed birational to the moduli space of $(1,11)$-polarized abelian surfaces, endowed with a symmetric theta structure and an odd theta characteristic. In this sense you can find a detailed description of this hypersurface in Lemma $2.1$ of this paper: M. GROSS, S. POPESCU, The Moduli Space of (1,11)-Polarized Abelian Surfaces is Unirational, Compositio Mathematica 126: 1-23, 2001. 

Let $X\subset\mathbb{A}^n$ an affine variety of dimension $k$, and let $L\subset\mathbb{A}^n$ a general linear subspace of dimension $n-k$. Consider the projective closures $\overline{X},\overline{L}\subset\mathbb{P}^n$, where $\mathbb{A}^n = \mathbb{P}^n\setminus H$, and $H\subset\mathbb{P}^n$ is an hyperplane. Assume $k$ algebraically closed. Then $$\#(X\cap L) \leq \#(\overline{X}\cap\overline{L}) = deg(\overline{X}).$$ Furthermore, if $\overline{L}$ is such that $(\overline{L}\cap H)\cap \overline{X} = \emptyset$ we have $$deg(X)=\#(X\cap L) = \#(\overline{X}\cap\overline{L}) = deg(\overline{X}).$$ 

The intersection numbers $H^4 =1,\; H^3\cdot E = 0,\; H^{2}\cdot E^2 = -2,\; H\cdot E^3 = -6$ are correct. The last one $E^4 = H^0\cdot E^4 = -18$ is wrong. A way to compute $E^4$ is the following. The blow-up $X$ of a smooth quadric surface $Q\subset\mathbb{P}^4$ is isomorphic to the blow-up of a smooth $4$-dimensional quadric in a point. Let us call $Y$ this blow-up, and let $E_p\subset Y$ be the exceptional divisor. Then $E_p^4 = -1$. On the other hand $E_p$ is the strict transform through the blow-up map $\epsilon:X\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^4$ of the $3$-plane spanned by $Q$. Then $E_p = H-E$, and $$E_p^4 = H^4-4H^3\cdot E+6H^2\cdot E^2-4H\cdot E^3+E^4.$$ Using the first four intersection numbers we get $$-1 = E_p^4 = 1-12+24+E^4,$$ and finally $E^4 = -14$. Summing up the intersection numbers you are looking for are: $$H^4 =1,\; H^3\cdot E = 0,\; H^{2}\cdot E^2 = -2,\; H\cdot E^3 = -6,\; E^4 = -14.$$ Another way to see this is the following: $$E^4 = -deg(Q)s_2 = -2s_2,$$ where $s_2$ is the second Segre class of the conormal bundle $N_{Q/\mathbb{P}^4}^{\vee} = \mathcal{O}_{Q}(-1)\oplus\mathcal{O}_{Q}(-2)$. The chern classes of this bundle are $c_1 = -3$ and $c_2 = 2$. Therefore $s_1 = 3$ and $s_2 = s_1^2-c_2 = 7$. Finally you get again $E^4 = -2s_2 = -14$. 

In general your polynomial $P(k)$ has degree $n$ as soon as there is a positive dimensional subscheme in the base locus of the linear system. Consider for instance the case $n=3$, $s = 2$, $m=2$, $d = 3$. Then the line through the two base points is in contained in the base locus of the linear system with multiplicity $1$. The rational map induced by this linear system is the projection of a Veronese $3$-fold $V$ in the $\mathbb{P}^{19}$ parametrizing cubics of $\mathbb{P}^3$ from the span of two general tangent spaces of $V$. Therefore, such a map is birational. Now you can compute that two general points of multiplicity $2k$ impose $$2\binom{2k+3-1}{3}-\binom{k+3-2}{3}$$ conditions at the surfaces of degree $3k$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$. The binomial coefficient $\binom{k+3-2}{3}$ gives the contribution of the base line. Therefore, in your notations we have $$\frac{2\cdot 8}{3!}k^3+Q(k)-P(k)$$ conditions, where $Q(k)= \frac{2}{3!}(12k^2+4k)$, and $$P(k) = \frac{1}{3!}(k^3-k)$$ which is still a polynomial of degree three.
