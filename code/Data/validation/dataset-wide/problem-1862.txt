First, be sure that you approach management on this subject in reference to future projects. Past projects -- or those you've just completed -- are just that, done, and there is no incentive for the company to compensate you for that. However, you could use completed projects in negotiations for a raise, and having a track record of success could help you in negotiations. (See suggestions at the bottom.) But no matter what, this is an example of how you should probably not approach this conversation. From How to Negotiate a Raise: 

If you want to change careers into an IT related role, take advantage of the fact that self-learning tools for these careers are highly accessible. Since you already have a Computer Science degree, you have the necessary foundation to be a software developer or to work in another IT role. I know people who have even secured jobs in these fields without having a degree. They were part of open source projects or they volunteered at places like FreeGeek, building computers for people who can't afford them or doing IT support for them. There is a lot of experience out there that you can gain in your free time. You have a job right now, and it sounds like you've been there awhile, so that shows that you're reliable and committed. Adding side projects during your off-time will show that you're a hard worker who enjoys learning new things, and employers desire developers and IT specialists who love to expand their knowledge. Lastly, working on different open source projects or volunteer work will also help you get a handle on what you want to do. For instance, if you volunteered at FreeGeek, you may decide that IT support isn't for you and move onto something different. Volunteer opportunities will give you a chance to explore your options, gain new skills, and build confidence that will help you get your foot in the door. 

A person who hired me for odd-jobs when I was 26 years old once said he hired me because I'd be more likely to do what I'm told and do the job his way than some grizzled, 40 year old who insisted on doing things his own way. This is ageism, and it's unfair, but the best we can do is know that it exists and do what we can to avoid it. There are many reasons why employers like to hire young people. Young people are generally more malleable, like clay, and are easier for employers to mold them into the type of person who fits the corporate culture. Additionally, employers know that younger people are more likely to defer judgement to older, more experienced colleagues; as a result, an employer knows that a younger candidate is more likely to "do what she's told". In addition, younger workers are more energetic, and are more likely to bring that energy and enthusiasm to the work environment. What's more, this energy is more likely to be used to learn new things. The ability to learn and adapt is an attribute many employers look for, especially with knowledge workers. Take focus off of age and place it on skills However, this is a stereotype, and you shouldn't allow yourself to be limited by preconceived notions about your age. Thus, take all of the focus off of your age and place it solely on skills and experiences that demonstrate your youthful ability to learn new things, adapt, and work with others. Being a recent college graduate at 53, you've more than likely spent quite a bit of time working with young people, and this should help prepare you to work with them. Use a functional-style resume to focus on skills, not timeline Now, since you haven't been to any interviews, I wonder how the interviewers could possibly know you're 53? If you're applying for entry level positions, it may be helpful to use a more functional resume style, which can help hide your work history and possibly avoid people "dating" you by looking at the resume. This can also help prevent you looking "overqualified" for the position. A functional resume allows you to focus only on the skills you wish to present while taking the focus away from the fact that you entered the workforce over 30 years ago. Use your youthful college experience to your advantage Lastly, use those college experiences to your advantage. If there were any projects you worked on with others, consider highlighting these on your resume. This will take the focus off your age and help recruiters mentally place you in the same buckets as 22 year old, bright-eyed graduates. After all, having a degree at 53 proves you're still quite capable of enthusiastically learning new things! Attend career fairs and networking events If you're finding trouble with a certain recruiting agency or temp agency, try using another service who understands and is willing to meet your needs. Also, try applying for jobs directly, attend career fairs, and attend networking events. The networking events are perhaps the most important: I got both my current job and my last job through networking events and career fairs. You never know who you might strike up a conversation with who knows someone who wants to hire someone with your skills! Finally, I want to add that we hire people of all ages. There are people in their 40's, 50's, and 60's who we've hired who are excited to work with us and learn new things. It was this enthusiasm, that youthful energy, that helped them land the job. Stay positive, and you'll succeed! 

Record Your Calls First, I'm sorry that you're put in this position. This is a tough spot to be in. Chances are, your boss is thinking about the risks to the business and the costs of losing the vendor/client. Right now, it's your word against the contact's, and if the contact continues to push this issue it can put you in a very tight spot where you can't negotiate properly with the contact because you're backed into a corner. One possible solution, one that's more accessible than getting a new job, is to record your calls with the contact. Accessible Technology: Fortunately, technology has provided us with quite a few tools that can be employed in situations like this to protect ourselves. At my work, we built an app that gives you your own phone number, and with some configuration, it can actually sit behind your regular phone. Additionally, there are free tools, such as Google Voice that can let you forward your number to your Gmail chat. The interesting thing about services such as these is that they record your calls. This is useful for several reasons, but in your case, they serve as a record of your conversations with the contact. Consult IT: If this is not an option, talk to your IT department and see if they can put an "approved" solution in place. If you're using a VOIP phone service, this may be easy for them to setup. Legal Disclaimer: One word of caution: I'm not sure what legal issues you'd run into. I think that as long as one party knows the conversation is being recorded, it's not illegal, and if it is, it may or may not be something you can use in court if the issue progresses. Your goal with using this tool should be just to protect yourself and show your boss and HR that you're not lying. DISCLAIMER: I'm no lawyer, so be sure to check the last paragraph with a licensed attorney. 

In summary, it's not incorrect to think of mandatory time away as a vacation, since an employee in this status would essentially be relieved of all work duties for a period of likely two consecutive weeks. Thus, assuming the mandatory time away is something the employee can plan in advance, it could be thought of as a vacation. In fact, the FDIC refers to this as a "vacation policy" in their regulation and safety manual. However, a vacation is not the same as mandatory time away. They're not reciprocal. While MTA can be used as a vacation and is a vacation, it more importantly serves as a safety check to mitigate financial risk and to detect and reduce losses. Note that, there's at least one person who alleges that they're able to meet the MTA requirements without using all of their vacation time simply by combining their leave time with time away on business at a conference. See this Banker's Online post. Since the FDIC's policy recommends two consecutive weeks absent from normal duties, it's conceivable that this time could be used for paid professional development approved by the bank or organization. As far as the statement about paid vacations not being a common practice in the United States, it just depends on what kind of work you do. If you're an engineer, teacher, scientist, researcher, manager, historian, banker, or work in some kind of professional capacity, you most likely have some form of paid time off. This also includes some blue collar professional work. However, if you work at the local Plaid Pantry, 7 Eleven, Circle K, or whatever the local convenience store is around the corner from the section 8 housing, you most likely don't get paid time off and earn minimum wage. In general, if your work is in high demand or involves skilled labor, you're more likely to receive a better benefits package. Hope this helps! 

Welcome to what Susan Cain calls "the new groupthink". In "Quiet, The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking", Susan describes how the open office plan has made it's way into the workplace. According to Susan, managers believe that it's not the single individual who is most able to innovate; instead, innovation comes from crowdsourcing, from the idea that solutions to complex problems will arise from brainstorming sessions that can only be had in groups. In her book, Susan describes how this line of thinking can be problematic for introverts (as well as extroverts) tasked with solving really complex problems that require deep focus and concentration, the type of tasks where one must maintain the state of several variables in one's head at the same time. Find a quieter workspace, if you have a laptop: While working on a group project in college, I literally excused myself from the computer lab and told the group I was going to find another lab to work in where I could focus on trying to solve a core problem we were working on. I explained to them that I'm at a point where I need to focus, and I suggested they use chat to talk with me if they have questions. I explained that chat allows us to still communicate but allows me to get to a stopping point before I answer any questions. This let the other 3 members collaborate on areas of the project I wasn't working on, allowed me to go off into "the zone", yet still allowed us to collaborate in a manner that let me get to a stopping point without losing my place. Communicate to others when you need time to focus When I'm working on relatively simple tasks, or tasks that involve using tools I know intimately, I can work and listen to the background noise in the office. I'm still productive. I can answer a quick question without losing my place. Chances are, you also have tasks that aren't too complicated to where you can work and talk at the same time. However, when trying to troubleshoot more complex issues, this is where this line of thinking fails. When working on things that involve maintaining the state of several systems in my head at the same time, I'll ask people to report bugs by chat or email, I'll put on my headphones, and ignore the world around me. The solution to this problem is to take the lesson I learned from my college group project and apply it to your situation. If you know you have something really complex to do, use chat to let your colleagues know that you'll need X hours of uninterrupted time to work on a complex problem. Ask that they chat you if they need something. Put on your headphones, even if you don't turn on the music. This will help others see that you're busy and make them less likely to interrupt you. The key is to communicate. It's harmful, especially as a System Administrator, to create an environment where people have to make an appointment to visit with you, but it's also harmful to your productivity to be interrupted when you're working on something complicated. So by communicating when you need uninterrupted time and when you're working on less complicated things, this will help maintain a healthy balance between your own productivity and being open to helping others. Most people will understand this as long a you're patient with them and understand that sometimes they will need something from you in order to get their job done too. Just know that you'll still get interrupted -- don't blow up at these people. Just calmly let them know you're in the middle of something and can get back to them in X hours. Eventually, more people will get the hint while not seeing you as a tyrant or a jerk. :)
