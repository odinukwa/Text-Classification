I use a sort of wave, raising my hand but with no movement in it (so not a 'Hey buddy' or 'I need help' side to side movement).... it works on my bicycle, on my motorcycle, and while driving a vehicle. It's got somewhat of a dual purpose: acknowledgement that I did something wrong, and/or 'thanks for letting me in' gratitude gesture. The motorcycle I find a very odd case of this. It's 95% not me giving the gesture, but receiving it after being cut off, not seen, turned in front of, etc. People are in general not interested in showing any rage and are quick to apologize when I'm on one, even if I'm not wearing the armored jacket and helmet. I don't get even half this respect in vehicles or bicycles. That was a side note that I've found interesting, but the point is that it's the same gesture I seem to get from many other people. There's no side/side or waving motion, just a hand up, fingers together, "Thanks/Sorry". 

When traffic is whizzing past you at 55-70 MPH, it's very unnerving to not see them until they've already passed you, and startling when the wind attempts to blow you over with little warning. Traffic that attempts to 'pull over' would be coming right into your ass end, and you'd have no way of knowing without mirrors. I've been nearly hit twice like this before I switched. By being able to see the car and their position, it is easy to tell if they are drunk/texting/swerving (which is rather common) before they get near you, and quick to turn into the gravel / down the embankment to avoid them. As far as the 'additive speed' argument, you're screwed anyway at highway speeds. Even if you're riding at 20 MPH, most the traffic is ~65 MPH - so 45 MPH blind and oblivious or 85 MPH with a chance to dodge or bail off your bike Without a mirror, an attentive and responsible bicyclist could get hit by an incompetent / pulling over driver riding 'with' the grain. However, in an 'against' scenario, both drivers have the ability to avoid the collision, and both would have to be not paying attention for a collision to occur. 

This isn't really meant to be a convincing argument to 'Race Lace' everything, but it certainly moves the prognosis from 'because you can't' to well within the realm of possible. If anyone has further reasoning why this is undesirable, I'd like to hear them. 

The closest I've seen yet is a roller cam u-brake, like the one below, only without the rollers: Roller Cam U-Brake Roller Cam U-Brake $URL$ They weren't original to the bicycle, but the frame is a 1997 GT Bravado, the brakes were purchased around 1997-1999. It came as a 1 1/8" threaded / 21 speed setup. 

Have you put it on a true stand? I'm assuming you don't see any obvious dents or seam separation, but a wheel can become untrue in such a way that the wheel is further from the hub at one end and closer to the hub at the other. This will be very hard to see because the change is very gradual, but will definitely cause vibrations at higher speed. Beyond that, the belts in tires sometimes separate, and the rubber will expand between the belt separation forming a 'bubble' in your tire. These are usually noticeable at low speeds, however, so I'd check the truing first. 

Front wheel is there for steering and braking. Rear wheel is there for acceleration and keeping the track. More stable front wheel will make it harder for you to turn and keep the desired track. On the other hand, rear wheel is fixed to the frame (exluding its rotation) and its enhanced stability also stabilise the bike and you. 

When you stretch a chain the distance between pegs become longer than designed. Even fatal chain stretch cannot be easily identified by looking at the chain. There are very simple yet accurate chain scales used to identify whether the stretch is none (new chain), fair, acceptable, "replace the chain", "replace all chain and sprockets". Another way to estimate the chain stretch is to try to lift the chain from the sprocket. The further you can lift it, the more stretched chain you have. One can see the chain is stretched far above the "replace the chain ASAP" level when the teeth on small sprockets are no more symmetrical and become worn from the rear side (upper teeth of the rear sprocket). When the chain starts skipping over the teeth, whole drivetrain it worn out and the chain still looks quite good to many people and is still very strong in tension and the peg-to-peg distance is stetched in orders of tenths of milimeters. Another reason for not-stretching a chain is the momentum one can produce on such bike. The crank arm is shorter on kid bikes than on the "full size" bikes. Therefore the tensile force you have applied to the chain was lower than you are able to apply on your bike. Since you were able to load the chain with weaker forces and even hard stretch will be negligible to wrong setup the only option left is that you have moved the rear wheel a bit front. Realign it, as others already suggested, and tighten it. It is worth nothing to get the chain measured for the wear, though. 

Note that hydrophobic film will create separated water droplet that will easily move on the surface - on the bike they will be blown sideways and drop off. Superhydrophobic surface will repel the water droplets as a wall repels tennis balls. 

The argument you are facing is false, obviously. The expenses may be divided in two parts, investments and running costs. Let's call investments all the money you have to pay to have a car i shape and legal. In case of a car there are money you have to pay to buy it, the insurance costs, annual oil change, etc. In case of the bike there are money to buy it, tyres, helmet, lights etc. Let's call the running costs all the money you have to inevitalby pay to get somewhere. In case of a car it is petrol, tyre wear, brake wear, etc. In case of a bike it is tyre wear, brake wear and your body fat (or a brakfast, you ate in the morning). The reason for daily commuting is based on a significant difference between running costs, which are not investments at all. Actually, not using a car results in no brake wear, no fuel consumption and limmited tyre wear and oil degradation. In my particullar case I spend 7k/yr on the insurance (mandatory insurance + windscreen insurance + animal collision), 1k/yr on motor oil and 5k/month on the fuel. Ignoring additional costs on brakes, wipers, screenwash, filters, etc. It's easy to see that the "investments" (I had allready paid in January) are a small money compared to the fuel costs (I have to pay every single month). Last year I drove 30k km - to work, weekend visits, holidays, etc. There might be a case one bought a car for one purpose: drive it to work and back.Here, switching from driving to riding may be considered as a waste of investments - money spent on insurance and owning are no more used. Suggest another use of the car - weekend trips etc. Therefore the "invested money" are reasonably used and the argument of wasted investment is proved false. One can temporarily or definitely exclude the car from the database and doesn't need to pay the insurance (and mustn't use the car). 

$URL$ If you want to talk about another measure of speed, you have to drop the term 'average speed' at the very least. What your method seems to be referring to would be something like the average of multiple constant interval average speeds, and as such two people both reporting their AoMCIAS could vary wildly, even if they traveled side-by-side. For example, why pick tenths of a mile? There are infinite variants of division lengths unit choices such that two AoMCIAS numbers can't even be related (unless the distance has been mutually agreed upon before measurement collection). Good luck getting the U.S. to adopt the metric system or the rest of the world to adopt Imperial units, so at minimum you'd have U.S. bicyclists reporting it over 0.1 mile intervals and everyone else at, perhaps, 0.2 km intervals. For that matter, why use length as the interval control? If you use a GPS, it's storing the data in semi-regular interval time units (depending on the unit and resolution setting), perhaps someone else tries to unify the U.S. with the rest of the world and proposes 10 second intervals as the new standard. The result is that AoMCIAS speed numbers would not convey enough information in and of their own value, like averages do. You'd have to report them as "24.56 miles/hour AoMCIAS over 0.1 mile intervals", and that value would vary so wildly by interval choice that it could ONLY be compared to other AoMCIAS speeds with the exact same interval. There wouldn't be a static conversion that could be done, either, you would need to completely resample the intervals from raw data, if it was even available. All of this is completely independent of it's relevance as a speed measure for bicycling (I have a mathematics degree, and don't time any of my bicycle rides). What I mean by this is: it's possible that you could devise a creative method such as AoMCIAS with an ideal interval distance or time such that the number reflects something more accurate about bicycling performance, and it may even be useful inside of the bicycling context (and likely ONLY the bicycling context). However, it will be of little to no value to anyone else, mathematically or even quick comparison-wise in colloquial speech. Two numbers could only really compared with equivalent intervals, and any ability to do neat things quickly in your head with such values would be relegated to special calculators, computer programs, and perhaps some genius savants. 

This happens commonly on vehicle/motorcycle tires, and for similar reasons. Non-bicycle tires use woven metal 'bands' that form the structure, with rubber molded around them. Bicycle tires use cloth/nylon/some other type of non-stretchy material with the rubber molded around it. You can usually feel them as the lines inside the tire. When bands break and/or separate, it allows air pressure to push out the now unsupported rubber around it out farther than normal. You may not even notice the inner part following, because they're not really one piece, more like two pieces of bread surrounding the meat (the bands). Further, they don't need to make both sections airtight, so usually just the outside is (even if you don't see holes, the rubber can be quite permeable (indeed it usually is to a small extent, even airtight ones). If you're asking what causes the breaking, it could be poor manufacturing, extreme flexing, folding, extreme heat, sitting flat on the bead for a while (or getting ridden on while flat), over-inflation, or any number of things that stress one section of the tire more than the rest of the structure. 

I am not sure what is happening actually. If you change the gear index by one and chain goes two it is a problem. Usually caused by misaligned derailleur - you are, say, in 3.9 position and change to 2.4, index shows 3 and 2, respectively, but the chain aligns to 4th and changes to 2nd gear. If you are able to change indexes not only by 1, or by more, per one push, it is not a bug. It is a feature allowing you to downshift much faster when you need downshift fast. If you are able to downshift by 2 gears only, there might be problem, though. Maybe one lever in the mechanism isn't alligned properly and it misses to lock the first position. Old lever or twist gear systems allow this fast change by design, indexed system needs "reload" to be able to change. 

Do not ride in rain This is absolutely foolproof, but it doesn't solve the problem if you want/need to ride. Do not wear glasses in the rain You will have clear view, but in heavy rain and/or higher wind this is painful and may be dangerous. They who must wear corrective glasses cannot use that option for sure. Wear helmet with visor When riding relatively slow the helmet makes sort of roof over your face protecting your glasses from the rain. Visor gives extra room for protection. (Thanks, @Criggie) In high winds and heavy rain it is useless. Use hydrophobic-coated glasses Such (super-)hydrophobic coatings repell water from the surface. Some are polymer-based which are relatively cheap but are vulnereable to scratching and oils. Rare earth ceramics are investigated to sort these drawbacks out, but might be very expensive. Surf sunglasses, Adidas glasses are available. Use MotoGP helmet for wet races These helmet have double visor with sealed gap. Regradless how you sweat, the visor is still bright without any fogging. The visor is also cvered with set of hydrophobic foils (when worn out, they tear one layer away uncovering new one), or there are two cassettes for hydrophobic tape covering the visor (one cassette with unused tape and second for the used part, when the visor is wetting, racer can roll out new part), or the visor is covered by hydrophobic coating. This option is most expensive, Byt you will have ultimate head protection and comfort in cold weather. 

It seems that you were braking only with the rear brake and used front as an emergency. This is the least effective way how to slow down. I often brake with rear wheel sliding, sometimes locked. When braking, the most of the energy is absorbed by front brakes. The deceleration puts mass to the front wheel and remove it from the rear wheel. The best way for braking is brake more with the front brakes, brace againts the handlebars and move the centre of mass as far as possible to the rear and low. This will reduce the risk of throwing off. For long descents it is better to brake hard and then release, then brake hard again. But, sometimes the best way is to find a soft place to land.
