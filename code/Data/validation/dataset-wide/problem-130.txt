This combination of safety measures would be sufficient to protect the ship during this maneuver, and the ship would not perform this maneuver at all if larger material was present. Even without the shield the passengers would be relatively safe. The Breakthough Starshot proposes a postage stamp sized craft to be sent to Alpha Centauri at .2 c. According to this paper, the erosion on the unshielded surface is only .5 mm deep over a ~4 year journey. So 5 min at .7 c won't be a big issue. With the shields in place little if anything would happen to the spacecraft. Without them, there will be very minor surface erosion, heating, and some charging of the spacecraft. Edit: For those concerned by radiation touched off by relativistic impacts this states that the HAB sections of the ship are made of nonmetallic compounds which reduce this effect. 

Vomit yellow in color Cryogenic liquid means it's boiling and smoking at room temperature. Melts/dissolves/burns almost everything "Glows" due to the burning of everything. 

Yes Food: Comets already contain amino acids and elements necessary for life as we understand it. Other sources are interstellar dust. Energy: Photosynthesis, as you suggested, would work well near stars. It may be beneficial to metabolize cosmic radiation too. 

Don't make it angry Give its a supply of cows. Cattle Drives were a ready supply of cattle and common in that time frame. Feed it and leave it in peace. Entombit it Locate the underground lair entrance, pack with dynamite and seal it inside. Bait Cow Entice it with a cow covered in poison, dynamite strapped to it with a long fuse and/or nitroglycerin trigger. Engage directly If you have to fight get every abled body person a repeating rifle and hope for the best. Increase odds of success by using a Punt Gun or two or three. 

Like cavemen I doubt they would get further than hand to hand combat (fin to fin? tentacle to tentacle?), simple weapons made out of some sort of sea life, like shells or teeth of a predator similar to these. If there was some plant that was analogous to a tree this stuff would be easier and you might get a pointy stick. It may also be possible to weaponize some poisonous or venomous sealife. Projectiles don't work well underwater so arrows and throwing weapons are out. Underwater you get no fire so refining metals is out of the question, so anything derived from it will not appear 

You have options Firstly, as other pointed out, if you can make a firearm you can make a sword. However, you could make it so that using melee weapons was not a practical means of warfare. For example, in the modern warfare, a firearm is more useful in combat because they are efficient, reliable, and carry plenty of bullets. If the guns in your story are more similar to modern firearms then melee weapons will not be the goto. Only in close quarters does the firearm loose its practicality. This is more cultural than technological. If you are willing to make the leap to a world lacking in Iron having other unusual properties, then naturally occurring ceramics could work. For example, a large deposit of Cubic Boron Nitride, for it has been found in nature, could be an analog for gun chambers. It would make a decent blade, but not a great sword. Similarly, a large deposit of say fist-sized diamonds from your local kimberlite pipe or swamp that got hit by a meteorite, would make good parts for a revolver. Assuming for some reason that diamonds are not valuable. 

It's not entirely implausible for two earth like planets to form this way, The giant impact hypothisis is after all almost exactly what you described. The one limiting fact that I see is that were one of the two bodies to end up with most of the iron (and by extension nickel) then the planet may not be able to generate a magnetic field. The movement of the molten metal core forms a geodynamo that produces the magnetic field which protects the atmosphere from the solar wind. Without the magnetic field, the solar wind will strip the atmosphere from a planet. So if the world with the small iron core did develop earth like conditions they may not last long. All other things being equal, the planet lacking the large iron core will also have a lower mass and by extension gravity than the other. Earth's core is about 1/3 of the mass of the planet. While not that big of an issue it does pose problems for gaining and holding onto the atmosphere especially when being blasted by the solar wind. As for their orbit, they would orbit like the earth-moon system. This means they orbit a Barycenter, the center of the masses of the two planets. For the earth-moon system that point is beneath the crust of the earth so from a distance the moon orbits the earth while the planet wobbles. Given the likely dissimilar masses the orbits may look like the pluto system: In summary, the system is not unrealistic. The two planets would have large differences in their masses and one would likely have a thinner atmosphere. But they could have earth like conditions and evolve life. 

Not exactly sure what you are asking so here goes... Moving a planet You have a few options for moving a planet, but I'm going to suggest gravity assist. Simply put, have a large amount of mass pass by the planet to change its orbit. To move a planet closer to the sun you will need to increase its speed and probably alter its trajectory to prevent from flinging it out of the solar system. This process will take time and a whole bunch of mass. Simply cannibalize a moon (or several) from an outer planet and launch it towards the inner system in pieces on a close pass to the Earth. Done properly, the launched mass will loose velocity and the earth will gain it. Over time this process will move the Earth towards the sun. Spinning up a planet Warning may have geological implications This is a little more challenging because planets have a whole bunch of inertia and halving the length of a day requires adding a bunch of angular momentum. We are also going to need to add a whole bunch of mass too. The mass will need to be launched on a trajectory that passes very close to the target planet and is moving at a speed that would be equivalent to the velocity of a geosynchronous orbit around the planet. As the mass passes by it needs to be caught by an orbital tether. Catching the mass in this manner increases the overall angular momentum of the system without decreasing the rotational velocity of the earth. With mass captured, reel it in and thanks to conservation of angular momentum, the rotation of the earth will increase. Like so: 

The biggest threat to the atmosphere is not the visible light, but the streams of charged particles. To protect against high energy particles, a smaller magnetic field between the planet and the star would work just as well as a planetary one. Placed at the $L_1$ point of the system and sized accordingly as shown in the picture. 

No Planet is really safe Barring the difficulties of actually glassing a planet, even a gas giant or water world could be glassed. In the Halo Universe, glassing can cook off the atmosphere because the intense heat causes a form of Atmospheric Escape. Once the atmosphere/water is boiled away what's left can be turned to glass. Not the most practical given the energy required, but it could be done. 

Not much at all Assuming you are talking about a pressure differential that that does not equalize across the body, i.e. not in the cases of diving or slow pressurization. Pressure really can only damage the lungs of there is a sharp increase, such as near an explosion. However, putting your mouth on a high-pressure line will work too. According to Wikipedia, 10 psi is sufficient to cause massive lung damage. The CDC seems to back this up. 

Sure Starting from geothermal water sources, they may be rich in minerals similar to what you find near deep sea vents. Sulpher and Iron compounds are very common and useful. Additionally, the action of the hot water over time creates veins of economic minerals, like gold and silver, that could be exploited for profit. Depending on the type of volcanic activity in the area, if there was a Diatreme eruption there at some point in the past, then diamonds could easily be found. Again, depending on the volcanology there may be a Volcanic Pipe which are also rich in precious gemstones. Depending on tech level, the geothermal sources could also be used a source of energy. 

It's not impossible to have a cave from the Hadean since you have the early formation of the cratons of contents which are stable over long geologic timescales. Just really unlikely and to my knowledge, there are none that have been found. Such caves would have been formed by lava rather than the action of water and would contain a geologic record specific to that time. Such caves would have to be closed off from the environment for the majority of their life because over geologic time they would be filled in. As for constructing an artificial cave, barring building it in the craton of a content and then sealing it somehow, there is nothing that could be done to allow it to last over significant geologic time scales. 

Have a look at Water Bears, they are one of the most resilient organisms on earth. They are not actual extremophiles, but they have high resistance to wide range of temperature 1 K to 470K, high vacuum to 1200 atmospheres. They can survive dehydration and freezing because their body expands. Even direct exposure to space for 10 days, was not fatal to them. Water Bears have been observed waking from suspended animation after 120 years. 

No real threat to the passengers The ISV has multiple measures to deal with the few threats in interstellar space. From your link: 

As mentioned your best bet would be objects off Earth, though they would likely have to be probes anchored on some stable body. After a billion years almost anything around the earth should be lost to orbital decay or to deep space from the steady push radiation pressure from the sun and orbital decay from the exosphere drag. This is a known issue with satellites in GEO due to the earth itself, interactions with the sun and moon, and radiation pressure. Station Keeping is required of nearly all spacecraft in orbit around the earth due to these interactions. Without constant upkeep of satellites and over this timescale it's unlikely that there would be anything to find in orbit around the earth. On earth actually, you are in luck; there are places on/near the surface that have remained stable for that period of time. It would be possible to find layers of strata that include unnatural minerals or even artifacts from that era. We have left an impression on the earth's geological record even now with the creation of plastics, even minerals, refinement of metals, movement of materials, and interfering with the ratios of radioactive isotopes.
