As stated, he did not believe that machines could think. However if we extend his ideas to a philosopher who does believe that machines can think, she would argue that there exist some decision boundaries which a machine could never perfectly recognize, such as the decision boundary between games and non-games. Those philosophers who reject meaning as use would argue that a sufficiently strong AI program would always be able to find a decision boundary if the meaning of the criterion is well defined.

The field of study that you are looking for is metalogic which is a field of philosophy (or, arguably it is at the intersection of philosophy and math as the regular study of logic is. For the sake of the argument, I'll stick with saying its in philosophy, but the point remains the same no matter what university department you'd find it in.) Here is a quote from the wikipedia article that explicitly states what you are looking for: 

Finally, for further textual references, the dialogs in which Socrates discusses what the Gods are like in respect to this conversation are Euthyphro, Republic book II, Phaedrus, and of course the Apologia. 

The Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century series is only those two volumes and provides a very thorough introduction to the subject and all of its history, while also positing some original claims about how the history and the subject should be interpreted as a philosophical field in and of itself. The The Analytic Tradition in Philosophy series is a much more in depth series that covers a lot of fine grain details starting all the way from the beginning and is planned to be a five-volume series. Only two have been published so far and I believe the second volume makes it only to the 1930's. Any of the above linked books should serve as a great introduction to the topic. In terms of what papers are a “must read”, you would probably want to be familiar with all of the biggest papers/books by the biggest names in the field. 

The answers to your questions are not going to be completely settled because they rely on specific theories of philosophy of language and language's relation to philosophy of mind. One very interesting thing to note before any explanations, however, is that Wittgenstein himself did not believe that machines could think. Additionally, he believes thinking "is centered around the human being; thus decidedly anthropocentric" as Obermeier points out. From Philosophical Investigations: 

The author then goes on to explain many paradoxes that arise with the belief in time travel, such as the grandfather paradox. However, then it is suggested: 

So now on to the question of whether Socrates believed in one God or many Gods. The generally accepted answer is that Socrates believed in an ambiguous monotheistic God. This view is similar to (and I hope I do not offend anyone by giving a simplistic view of) the Brahman in Hinduism. Socrates speaks amply of paying tributes to the Gods and that the Gods are virtuous, and yet he also speaks of God being the eternal source of everything that is good. Similarly to how Hindu Gods and Goddesses are aspects of the same singular deity, the Brahman, Socrates believes that the Gods and Goddesses are aspects of the same monotheistic deity. In the original text Plato uses both singular and plural forms of "Theos" much like ancient Hindu texts use the singular and plural form of "Deva" (Sanskrit word for God). Socrates believed that his inner daimonion was his, and all of our, means of communication with this deity. On a monotheistic view it is very similar to how Christian theology considers the Holy Spirit in relation to the Godhead. However, there is an alternative. It should be pointed out that Socrates specifically refers to Apollo (Apollo is the specific God whom the oracle of Delphi communicated with) on multiple occasions. 

Construction in intuitionism shouldn't be thought of as you would think of construction in terms of building a house. It means that we are constructing the rules, and therefore the objects we create with the rules, from within our own minds. This view is in contrast to, for example, mathematical platonism which says that mathematical objects are actual immaterial or abstract objects. Again, the reason that intuitionism says mathematical ideas are "constructed" is to contrast with the idea that they are "discovered" which is prevalent in platonism. The role Kant's philosophy of mind and philosophy of mathematics played in Brouwer's cannot be understated. For a better sense of what he means by intuition you will probably be greatly helped by studying Kant. Inevitably you'll end up reading about the analytic/synthetic distinction as well. Consider the differences in these statements: "I have constructed a proof that 1 + 1 = 2" and "I have discovered a proof that 1 + 1 = 2" Its true that if we are being loose with language we might not mean a great deal of difference in those two statements, however if we are being very careful about the philosophy of mathematics those two statement are entirely different. Intuitionism is the school of thought that we can only construct proofs through our own intuition. 

The Perseus Collection is a great online collection of ancient texts in their original languages (with a built in translation dictionary) as well as lots of different English translations. Here is the Republic. There are also multiple scans of the text on archive.org. For example, here is Part I and Part II of Paul Shorey's 1935 publication, it has the original Greek as well as his English translation side by side. 

Plato uses all four of these arguments for the immortality of the soul. Central to all of these arguments is that the soul is something immaterial and separate from our body. These four arguments are the central arguments given for the entire dialog and a rejection of the soul being immaterial, or even existing, would leave the arguments with nothing to say. To give an illustrative example, let's try to substitute in something that a materialist would argue for into Plato's arguments and see what is left. For this, let's imagine this philosopher believes the mind is just the consciousness brought about by neural activity in the brain. The cyclical argument would become an argument that someone's neural activity would need to eventually start to happen again after their death because opposites need to balance each other out. A materialist would be more likely to have their views of causation in line with what modern science says and this argument doesn't seem to hold any scientific weight. Irreversible damage to the neural structure of a body as it decays would not reverse itself just because "nature needs to be balanced." The argument from recollection might be seen as a "God of the gaps" argument from a materialist. Plato says that there is no way that we could have a priori knowledge without our souls retaining it from another life. However, current understandings of things like language and psychology allow for psychological nativism which can explain a priori justification and knowledge. The affinity argument explicitly states that the souls is an immaterial object with properties similar to other immaterial things. If we accept the materialist view that the brain is the source of consciousness then we would also accept that the mind dies when the body dies, as the neurons stop functioning. This is a direct contradiction of what the argument asserts. Finally, the the final argument could have a similar rejection to the rejection of the cyclical argument. The argument would be that the neurons in someones brain have been alive and functioning at one point and according to the theory of Forms they would have to continuously function because Forms are unchanging. This is in direct contrast to what we know about the body. Plato himself would even reject this idea. He sees the brain as being part of the body and the brain dies along with the body. If we say that the brain is what creates the mind then the mind would need to die as well. He wouldn't be happy with saying the brain is what creates the mind but he would argue if that were true then the mind would die along with the body. 

This is a proof of the propositional sentence (A → C) from the axiom ((A → B) → C) using the hypothetical syllogism rule of logical inference, which is what "HS" stands for. Next we have quantifiers and predicates. Predicates allow us to break up propositions into two parts, a predicate and a subject. If we imagine the proposition W to mean "The woman is tall" then we can say that "the woman" is the subject and "is tall" is the predicate. We introduce new letters to distinguish between subjects and predicates. Capital letters are predicates and lowercase letters are subjects. The syntax is that the predicate is written before the subject, for example: "Yx". Now we have: 

the opposite is true. "Only" causes less conditions to apply and the point you made in 9 is backwards. If P is a sufficient condition for Q (P→Q) that means that there is a set of conditions for which Q is true and those include the conditions in which P holds. However there are also conditions in which Q is true when P does not hold. If P is a necessary condition for Q (Q→P) this means that the only conditions in which Q is true are conditions when P holds. This means that, in regards to P being a condition for Q, NC ⊆ PC. Reference for the last paragraph. In summation, linguistically you are correct that "if" comes before a SC and "only if" comes before a NC. However, those exact expressions are not necessary to describe a material implication (→) (we can use other sentences, such as the ones I outlined above). This means that logically "only" is just an artifact of the natural language we're using that helps us identify an NC. 

Her paper then goes on to outline the other parallel she discovered. Additionally, the original paper she is referencing is here. If we take a philosophical stance, as opposed to a purely linguistic stance, and we concern ourselves with propositions, then it is widely accepted that present tense propositions are inherently indexical. As outlined above, the argument is that the truth value of something such as "my dog is happy" can change from time t-naught to time t-one. Therefore, the propositions carry some indexical, and in certain circumstances anaphoric, structure to them. If a present tensed proposition is expressed without a use of indexicality it would still need to account for the fact the that its truth value could change at some later time, or have been different at an earlier time. The arguments above support the idea that this is synonymous with indexicality and therefore that would be impossible. 

The second topic is the study of metaphysical parts and wholes. This is most certainly the topic that relates the most to your question and it also uses the concept of a subset. Parthood is defined to be a sense of partial ordering of the set and subsets, meaning that there is some sort of order as to what parts come before or after others. The partial ordering is defined to have three properties: 

As Mauro points out in his comment to your question, Brouwer based a lot of his ideas on Kant's views of mathematics. Central to Kant's views is the idea that mathematics is intuitive, meaning purely of the mind: 

Linguistic relativity is a thesis that talks about people's perceptions of the world. It doesn't do anything to alter the actual structure of the world. The laws of causality are defined by Einstein's relativity and they tell us that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, and superluminal messaging is what is required for time travel. Linguistic relativity is a thesis that talks about how language influences, or possibly defines people's thought, not how it influences the causal structure of the world. There's no part of the thesis that gives language the power to restructure physics. Information cannot travel at superluminal speeds so people cannot have cognition of events before they happen. If a language develops to a point where somebody perceives themselves as being able to tell the future, that is a completely different thing than that person actually being able to tell the future. 

Their argument centers on how we methodologically go about structuring theories of knowledge. What may be the correct way towards epistemic analysis in one domain may not be the same in another. Most of their argumentation is centered around the structure of the epistemological argument, criticizing and analyzing the way in which we take part in epistemology, as opposed to addressing exactly how a human can gain knowledge from an abstract, nonphysical realm. In this sense they aren't rejecting (3) as being flat out false, they are stating that it does not provide a full account of what is going on. These are just a few examples of literature on this topic. For further reading see the bibliography of the SEP article here. 

The Copenhagen interpretation treats quantum mechanical objects as purely probabilistic objects. It treats the wave function (the collection of amplitudes) as a truly probabilistic object. Generally, the Copenhagen school of thought is described as being a system that accepts nondeterminism in physical theories. They say we have absolutely no idea what the outcome of an experiment will be and neither does the particle until the experiment happens and it then instantly makes a "choice" based off of probability. 

This answer was very hard to do without LaTex and I'm sure it is hard to parse, (I am also very tired as I write this and might have made a mistake, so I am thankful to any edits that can fix them if they exist), but hopefully I can now give a summary that explains what is going on. As stated, I don't know why he did not introduce the symbols before giving a derivation of what they mean, but he uses ≺ to mean a logical implication, ⊃ in a regular material implication way (notice how (11) is written with ⊃), and → as physical implication. ≺ and → are both material implications, but they are about different things (this is why (11) could be written with both). The relevant subject matter of the paper, and the wider literature about fatalism, is engrossed in understanding alethic modality so it makes sense to try to distinguish what things are logically modal and what things are physically modal. I don't know why Aune introduced the symbols the way he did, but the explanation of what they mean is what the rest of that paragraph discusses. One last caveat, again alluding to the fact that I am very tired, I might have misunderstood some of the arguments that were being presented (the more that I think about the switch to Principia punctuation, the more I second guess myself). This being said, I am absolutely confident that the last move from (11) to (12) confirms what I have explained the symbols to mean.
