Morality is about how to solve problems in living: choices where people have conflicting ideas. For example, should I take a job repossessing property from debtors who can't or won't pay? Many think it seems mean to take stuff from poor people, but it also seems wrong to deprive lenders of their rightful property. No fixed set of ideas can solve all moral problems for various reasons. New theories about how the world works may seem to bring current moral principles into conflict with one another. New technologies may open up new opportunities to do things that formerly were not possible and bring up new moral problems about when we should use the technology, e.g. - nuclear bombs and abortion. Any book only contains a finite number of ideas and the authors can't anticipate new technologies and explanations, so no such book can answer all moral questions. Some books may have a lot of good content and solve a lot of moral problems, but even understanding such books requires recreating the explanations in that book for yourself constrained by keeping your ideas consistent with the book. And applying such ideas to your particular situation requires thought even in the absence of new technology and knowledge. There are problems with the idea that god is the source of morality pointed out in Plato's dialogue Euthyphro. If some moral act is good just because god says so, that's a bit unsatisfactory. If it's good for some other reason and god advocates doing good for that reas, then that other reason explains why the act is good rather than god. Living a better life than you could by following tradition and religious books would require having good ideas about epistemology and improving on religious books and traditions. Most secular people have bad epistemology such as inductivism, which was criticised by Popper and his followers: see "Objective Knowledge" by Popper chapter 1, "Realism and the Aim of Science" by Popper chapter I, "On the sources of knowledge and of ignorance" by Popper in "Conjectures and Refutations" and "The Fabric of Reality" Chapters 3 and 7 and "The Beginning of Infinity" chapters 1,2 and 10 both by David Deutsch. And secular moral philosophy is a train wreck with very few exceptions: secular philosophers have almost all tried to tear down tradition and replace it with ideas that couldn't stand up to determined criticism, e.g. - the advocacy of socialism despite its refutation by Ludwig von Mises and Ayn Rand. The average secular person is coasting on what remains of religious moral traditions and couldn't explain a moral idea if his life depended on it. The standard religious and secular moral traditions are both deeply flawed and need to be reformed. A start at such reform has been made by William Godwin and Ayn Rand, there is a small amount of moral stuff by Popper and David Deutsch, and Elliot Temple has written some good material, see $URL$ 

An interpretation of a theory, in particular quantum theory, is said to be an account of what that theory is saying about the world that can be cleanly separated from the theory's predictions. People who accept this idea claim that different interpretations of quantum theory can't be tested, and the question of which interpretation is true is not solvable. This line of argument is incorrect. One problem with this idea is that predictions of a theory are accounts of what is happening in the world according to some theory under some particular set of circumstances. Without such an account there is no such thing as whether an experiment has been set up properly, and so an experiment can't be set up. So an account of what the theory claims about reality can't be separated from its predictions, and this is just as true of quantum theory as of any other theory. Another problem is that scientific theories in general are not about predictions, they are about what is happening in reality. The predictions are a means of testing an account of what is happening in reality, they are not the whole point of having a theory. For example, lots of dinosaurs were never fossilised. The existence of those dinosaurs doesn't lead to any particular prediction, but it is a consequence of the theory that dinosaurs existed and of the mechanisms of fossilisation. You can't separate that consequence from the rest of the theory and ignore it without ruining the explanation that the dinosaur theory provides. Various theories are said to be interpretations of quantum mechanics. Some of these, such as the pilot wave theory, have a different account of what is happening in reality from quantum theory and try to make that account produce testable predictions different from quantum mechanics. Some intepretations, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, say stuff that is vague or inconsistent, e.g. - sometimes quantum theory describes reality and sometimes it doesn't. Such theories fail to make predictions because they fail to give an account of what is happening in experiments. There is one interpretation that takes quantum theory seriously as a description of reality - the many worlds interpretation. The MWI makes testable and specific predictions and gives an account of what is happening in reality - reality consists of a structure that in some circumstances looks like a collection of universes as described by classical physics, see $URL$ and "The Beginning of Infinity" Chapter 11 by David Deutsch. 

Several answers have been given above about what a law of physics is or does or whatever. One of them claims that laws of physics are about prediction, another claims they are a 'provisional statement of an observed regularity in Nature'. From these statements, it follows that anything that can't be observed is not part of physics. It may be impossible to put a measuring instrument in the core of the sun, and so by this standard, physics has nothing to say about the core of the sun. We also can't measure the past because we can't travel into the past and stick measuring instruments into it, and so the whole past history of the universe is not part of physics. Anything that is spacelike separated from us also can't be measured and so is not part of the laws of physics. There is another extremely serious problem. All of the limitations I pointed out are a consequence of the laws of physics. The laws of physics strictly forbid observations of a lot of the stuff they refer to. Physics is not about prediction. Science in general is not about prediction. Rather, science in general is about explanation: giving an account of what is happening in reality and why it is happening. A prediction itself is such an explanation. If you can't explain what's going on in an experiment, which includes stuff you can't observe, then you can't do the experiment. Why? Because the idea that the laws of physics is about observations, if taken seriously, destroys the distinction between correct and incorrect measurements and so destroys the whole subject of measurement theory and all experimental science. This is a matter of immediate practical experimental relevance. It is not a theoretical quibble or anything like that. The dominance of the idea that science is about prediction is a serious threat to theoretical and experimental progress. Witness the pathetic, floundering confusion in physics about explaining even the simplest quantum mechanical experiments. One of the comments claims that physics is about dynamical laws. This is not true either. The second law of thermodynamics is not a dynamical law. For more explanations of these points see 'The Fabric of Reality' and 'The Beginning of Infinity' by David Deutsch, and also $URL$ 

Any idea you want to postulate should be proposed in such a way as to make criticism as easy as possible so that it can be eliminated if it is wrong. This leads to many methodological constraints as explained in "Logic of Scientific Discovery" by Karl Popper. For example, an idea should have implications for some issue beyond the problem it was originally invented to solve partly because if it has no such implications there is no way to eliminate it if it is wrong. For more details of the rules Popper proposed see $URL$ and references therein. 

Some memes get copied because they do something useful - rational memes. For example, some ideas help people create scientific knowledge, e.g. - statistics. Other memes get copied by preventing a person from using his ability to criticise and replace ideas - anti-rational memes. In any individual case, giving money to a beggar may be a result of a rational or anti-rational meme. A rational reason to give to a beggar might be to help him become productive and do stuff that will help you. The idea that you owe some random person on the street a living is an anti-rational meme. A person might be poor because he has shitty ideas that keep him poor, so trying to give him a living wouldn't work. So the answer is "it depends". 

Underlying your question are some mistakes. First, whether eating a particular food is healthy depends a lot on the context. If somebody spends a lot of time doing physically demanding activities, then it may be good for him to eat high calorie foods. The person may be doing manual labour on a building site, or training for a sporting event or something like that. And if a person has a low paying job and there is no fridge available it may be that the best food he can take with him is food you would regard as unhealthy. So you actually don't know whether you are helping or harming the person who takes the food out of the pantry with respect to his health. So from that perspective it is okay for you to put the food in the pantry. Second, a person may choose to pursue values other than health and you should not presume that you know better than he does how to live his life. Even if the person is doing something extremely unhealthy like smoking, it doesn't follow that you could make his life better by forcing him not to smoke. The only thing you should use to get him to stop smoking is argument, e.g.- pointing out the health effects, pointing to better alternatives, proposing solutions to his problems. And you should give such arguments only if the person is interested and you should want him only to follow a course of action if he has no objections to it. To do otherwise is to expect him to act on ideas of which he has criticisms, which is irrational. One implication of this is that if you put food in a pantry, you should not presume to know that the person who took it shouldn't have taken it. So unless you're willing to spend a lot of time solving another person's problems it might be the case that the best you can do to help him is put your "unhealthy" food in the pantry. A third problem is that you are implicitly not treating the person taking the food from the pantry as a moral agent. You are acting as if you are responsible for his choices. You're not. His problems are not your problems unless you choose to make them your problems. If putting the food in the pantry is a convenient way for you to get rid of the food, then you should do it. What other people do with that food is not your problem. Another concern is that you say you "end up with" food items you don't want. You should look for ways to avoid getting stuff you don't want. If somebody is giving it to you, then perhaps you should say you don't want it. If you win it in a raffle you could leave the "prize" unclaimed (or don't enter the raffle).
