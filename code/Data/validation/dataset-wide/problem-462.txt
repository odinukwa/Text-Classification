I have lots of bikes and lots of interesting wheel sizes, I would like to know how to calculate the right spoke lengths for a wheel. I appreciate that there are probably rather a lot of variables but this is something that has been an issue for me from time to time so being able to work out the right spoke length for an arbitrary wheel (did I mention that I have half a dozen or more different wheel sizes in the garage?) would be useful. To be clear - I don't want a calculator, I want to know what the sums are. 

I do the supermarket run every week by bicycle - have done for about 7 years Family of four so I more or less fill a full size shopping trolley every time. This is made possible by a Christiana Trailer which is pretty much equivalent in load capacity to a shopping trolley: 

I have 3 trailers and have previously owned a fourth (which was my first) each of which has had a different attachment mechanism. You have 3 issues to address: 

The argument you are facing is false, obviously. The expenses may be divided in two parts, investments and running costs. Let's call investments all the money you have to pay to have a car i shape and legal. In case of a car there are money you have to pay to buy it, the insurance costs, annual oil change, etc. In case of the bike there are money to buy it, tyres, helmet, lights etc. Let's call the running costs all the money you have to inevitalby pay to get somewhere. In case of a car it is petrol, tyre wear, brake wear, etc. In case of a bike it is tyre wear, brake wear and your body fat (or a brakfast, you ate in the morning). The reason for daily commuting is based on a significant difference between running costs, which are not investments at all. Actually, not using a car results in no brake wear, no fuel consumption and limmited tyre wear and oil degradation. In my particullar case I spend 7k/yr on the insurance (mandatory insurance + windscreen insurance + animal collision), 1k/yr on motor oil and 5k/month on the fuel. Ignoring additional costs on brakes, wipers, screenwash, filters, etc. It's easy to see that the "investments" (I had allready paid in January) are a small money compared to the fuel costs (I have to pay every single month). Last year I drove 30k km - to work, weekend visits, holidays, etc. There might be a case one bought a car for one purpose: drive it to work and back.Here, switching from driving to riding may be considered as a waste of investments - money spent on insurance and owning are no more used. Suggest another use of the car - weekend trips etc. Therefore the "invested money" are reasonably used and the argument of wasted investment is proved false. One can temporarily or definitely exclude the car from the database and doesn't need to pay the insurance (and mustn't use the car). 

Interestingly, there was a point where studies (too long ago for me to even begin to remember sources) suggested that cyclists were probably less affected by pollution because, as a consequence of the regular exercise they were taking, their lungs were more efficient and so needed less air (and hence pollutants) to get the same oxygen. This was perhaps somewhat mitigated by being outside rather than in a box with filtered air (and the filtering has got more efficient). What this means in practical terms - if the studies were right - is that you don't need to be specifically concerned as a cyclist but that doesn't mean that air quality isn't an issue you should be concerned about as an inhabitant of or visitor to a city. 

The keys are 2, 3 and 4 the rest are bonus features that differentiate it from the alternatives. For what its worth, its a Topeak Jo Blow Pro - but what resemblence mine bears to a current model is unknown. 

I have to add this - though will probably get mauled for it... Ride a recumbent (-: Ok, I accept that this is probably not a practical answer to the problem - its also the case that recumbents have their own issues with being in the seat for extended periods of time (e.g. numb bums) but in terms of comfort overall I know which I'd rather cover 50 miles on. 

Do not ride in rain This is absolutely foolproof, but it doesn't solve the problem if you want/need to ride. Do not wear glasses in the rain You will have clear view, but in heavy rain and/or higher wind this is painful and may be dangerous. They who must wear corrective glasses cannot use that option for sure. Wear helmet with visor When riding relatively slow the helmet makes sort of roof over your face protecting your glasses from the rain. Visor gives extra room for protection. (Thanks, @Criggie) In high winds and heavy rain it is useless. Use hydrophobic-coated glasses Such (super-)hydrophobic coatings repell water from the surface. Some are polymer-based which are relatively cheap but are vulnereable to scratching and oils. Rare earth ceramics are investigated to sort these drawbacks out, but might be very expensive. Surf sunglasses, Adidas glasses are available. Use MotoGP helmet for wet races These helmet have double visor with sealed gap. Regradless how you sweat, the visor is still bright without any fogging. The visor is also cvered with set of hydrophobic foils (when worn out, they tear one layer away uncovering new one), or there are two cassettes for hydrophobic tape covering the visor (one cassette with unused tape and second for the used part, when the visor is wetting, racer can roll out new part), or the visor is covered by hydrophobic coating. This option is most expensive, Byt you will have ultimate head protection and comfort in cold weather. 

I do trail riding with some technical elements, and I have decided to upgrade my normal helmet to some sort of a full-face helmet. I have seen some sturdy-looking helmets, which resemble the motorcycle ones (example). However, their ventilation looks bad, so I don't want these. I am interested in the lighter variant, which looks like a normal helmet with a chin guard attached to it (example) - chin guard may or may not actually be removable. So, if I get the latter type of helmet, do I get significantly better protection, comparing to non-full-face helmets? Specifically, will it protect me from a direct face-plant? Is there a significant risk of the chin guard snapping and hurting me? Does it matter if the chin guard is made of metal or plastic? 

The problem is, when keeping the pedals horizontal, I always ride with my left foot ahead of the right one (like the guy on the picture does). When I turn left (like in the picture), everything is OK. But when I turn right, the saddle gets in the way (you can imagine it by looking at the picture - if he turned right, the saddle would push his right leg out of place). What can I do about it? The following works but is not ideal: 

It seems that you were braking only with the rear brake and used front as an emergency. This is the least effective way how to slow down. I often brake with rear wheel sliding, sometimes locked. When braking, the most of the energy is absorbed by front brakes. The deceleration puts mass to the front wheel and remove it from the rear wheel. The best way for braking is brake more with the front brakes, brace againts the handlebars and move the centre of mass as far as possible to the rear and low. This will reduce the risk of throwing off. For long descents it is better to brake hard and then release, then brake hard again. But, sometimes the best way is to find a soft place to land. 

When you stretch a chain the distance between pegs become longer than designed. Even fatal chain stretch cannot be easily identified by looking at the chain. There are very simple yet accurate chain scales used to identify whether the stretch is none (new chain), fair, acceptable, "replace the chain", "replace all chain and sprockets". Another way to estimate the chain stretch is to try to lift the chain from the sprocket. The further you can lift it, the more stretched chain you have. One can see the chain is stretched far above the "replace the chain ASAP" level when the teeth on small sprockets are no more symmetrical and become worn from the rear side (upper teeth of the rear sprocket). When the chain starts skipping over the teeth, whole drivetrain it worn out and the chain still looks quite good to many people and is still very strong in tension and the peg-to-peg distance is stetched in orders of tenths of milimeters. Another reason for not-stretching a chain is the momentum one can produce on such bike. The crank arm is shorter on kid bikes than on the "full size" bikes. Therefore the tensile force you have applied to the chain was lower than you are able to apply on your bike. Since you were able to load the chain with weaker forces and even hard stretch will be negligible to wrong setup the only option left is that you have moved the rear wheel a bit front. Realign it, as others already suggested, and tighten it. It is worth nothing to get the chain measured for the wear, though. 

The question is marginal 'cos its asking about specifics which change over time and products which are not necessarily universally available. My (very wonderful) trackpump has certain attributes that make me like it but given that its at least 6, more likely 8 or 10 years old so... better to define the things that make me like it: 

If you use a trailer its pretty much the same as using a pushchair (stroller) and indeed some double up (I wouldn't get one that doesn't) - you'll get a 5 point harness, a seat that reclines and you can get head cushions and the like too. Of course a trailer may not be practical in your circumstance (though I'd be surprised) but if it is it also helps deal with the problem of all the other stuff you want to carry when going out with a small child. One other option for practical as opposed to more recreational use is a cargo bike or trike of some sort - I'd've loved one of these a Nihola or a Christiana Trike - in which you can put the same seat/carrier you'd use in a car 'til they're of a size to sit up. There are also Dutch cargo bikes that can similarly be equipped with benches, rain covers, etc. But I'd probably still have wanted a trailer too for longer rides (-: 

Front wheel is there for steering and braking. Rear wheel is there for acceleration and keeping the track. More stable front wheel will make it harder for you to turn and keep the desired track. On the other hand, rear wheel is fixed to the frame (exluding its rotation) and its enhanced stability also stabilise the bike and you. 

I am not sure what is happening actually. If you change the gear index by one and chain goes two it is a problem. Usually caused by misaligned derailleur - you are, say, in 3.9 position and change to 2.4, index shows 3 and 2, respectively, but the chain aligns to 4th and changes to 2nd gear. If you are able to change indexes not only by 1, or by more, per one push, it is not a bug. It is a feature allowing you to downshift much faster when you need downshift fast. If you are able to downshift by 2 gears only, there might be problem, though. Maybe one lever in the mechanism isn't alligned properly and it misses to lock the first position. Old lever or twist gear systems allow this fast change by design, indexed system needs "reload" to be able to change.
