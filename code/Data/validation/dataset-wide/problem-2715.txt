No member of this set is such that x=y; in other words, it's not possible for Ralph to say what Alexa will say. But what's more telling here is that this is a perfectly reasonable description of an entirely deterministic universe. Every possible scenario in follows determinism, by definition; each effect is an inevitable result of an antecedent cause. All that's happening here is that we're claiming that what Ralph says is the antecedent cause, and what Alexa says is the effect. Now, swap Ralph back out with Nostradamus. Nothing here should change about the mechanics of the universe; the only thing that changes here is the presumption that Nostradamus can fill Ralph's role, and be an oracle. But that's not necessarily possible, so we need another premise. Let's suppose it's possible in this scenario for Nostradamus to predict what Alexa will say, and for Alexa to be unable to do anything else. Call this premise (P3). We now have a contradiction. Suppose Nostradamus makes a prediction (P3 presumes this is possible), and call it x1. (P3) implies Alexa must say y1, such that x1=y1. That conflicts with (P2), because (P2) does not have an (x,y) where x=y in its set of possibilities. But a contradiction doesn't tell you that a particular premise is wrong; it only tells you something is. So let's break this down: 

To make this a solid argument you need to tie in the missing step; you would need to show that the process that forms the sentence is conscious. At best all you've convincingly argued for is that it is caused by conscious experience in a semantically relevant way. 

...let's pause here. We feel as if these are our decisions; and as if we are in control. I think adding the word "consciousness" to this adds theoretical baggage... the theory that everything that is us is conscious. This is part of where you're going awry. For example, by the above model, if intentions are generated unconsciously, we could still become aware of those intentions. And if our sense of control is a perception of attaining intentions, we can consciously experience this as control without it being a superfluous sensation. In such a case, the intentions genuinely won't be "consciously made", but our conscious experience of it won't be illusory either; it would be a genuine percept of attaining a real intention. In other words, "something" does indeed have the intention, and the sense of control is indeed about "something" related to attaining the intention; it's just that this "something" isn't a conscious process, but rather is merely a thing that at some point is experienced consciously. 

Although the sexual domain is clearly an arena of reciprocity, altruism, selfishness, emotional blackmail, dominance-submission, guilt-inducement, etc. etc. posing ethical and moral questions of various kinds, one feels that there is a conspicuous absence of philosophical theories and discussion concerning sexual intercourse and other sexual behaviours including flirting, foreplay, afterplay, etc. From a common man's perspective, it seems as though philosophers felt and still feel bound by ancient taboos concerning this area of human behaviour! Although almost all religions contain dos-and-don'ts, which are mostly don'ts, such as, no unnatural sex, no premarital sex, no masturbation, etc., It appears that almost no religions and no philosophers prescribe any "dos" such as, for instance, "Thou shalt pleasure thy partner until he/she is satiated, Thou may use hands, mouth and various other body parts for the purpose". Have any philosophers discussed the sexual domain and prescribed moral/ethical frameworks and boundaries for normal and routine sexual intercourse and behaviors between men and women? If there is indeed a scarcity of philosophical exploration as I am conjecturing, what are the possible reasons for such non-exploration of this fertile area of human behaviors? 

Firstly, is it ethical to convince young men (and women) to risk death and injury by enlisting in the army and going to war? Secondly, if the person running such an enlistment campaign has absolutely no intention of doing so himself (or is physically incapable due to age), is it ethical for him to run such a campaign? Thirdly, if the person running the enlistment campaign makes a handsome living by getting a commission for every young person who enlists, does it make this act less ethical? Or more so? And finally, if the probability of the enlisted person dying or being critically injured in the battlefield is 60 per cent, does it make it much more unethical than if the probability were, say, 30 per cent? 

The assumption is untrue: the explanation of some simple things is more complex than the thing itself. For instance, take the act of throwing a ball. It is a gross motor skill that any one-year-old kid is expected to have. However, if one tries to explain i.e. verbalize the act of throwing a ball, one would have to approach the task in terms of various bones, joints and muscles involved, and various forces of physics such as gravitation, acceleration and momentum. To explain a skillful throw, one would have to further involve aspects such as eye-hand coordination, split-second timing of hip, leg, shoulder, arm and hand movements, proprioception, angular velocity etc. So, it would take a whole PhD thesis to explain one single throw of a star baseball pitcher! One can give any number of such examples of things that are simpler than their explanation. 

In particular, the fact that {(P1),(P2)} is a valid consideration means that determinism per se does not lead to fatalism. The argument that Nostradamus shows (P1) leads to fatalism is flawed for this reason; in particular, the flaw is that it imports fatalism itself into the premises, thus begging the question. Note something crucial here, however. The impossibility of an oracle under determinism requires two things: (1) A spite-machine, (2) an oracle's prediction specifically being fed as an input. Were Nostradamus not to "interfere", we could always import him into a deterministic universe. Alexa's not breaking anything; Alexa's not conscious, doesn't have free will, and isn't indeterministic. If Nostradamus were an all knowledgeable calculator, it would be trivial to work out what Alexa would do. It's only if the result of that were itself an input that we can wire in contradictions. In other words, the conflict here has nothing to do with consciousness per se; or even free will; it's simply a result of effects having antecedent causes, an oracle being an antecedent cause, and the mechanism to "counter" that cause. But this description in itself is enough to import "evitability", which gives you survival advantages. 

I don't think the outcome really matters much with respect to free will per se. Choice per se extends to the point that we as agents initiate an action with a desired goal. A father might jump into a freezing lake to try and save his daughter; this doesn't mean he forsees a future of him saving his daughter, or saving his daughter is actually possible. Since there's not really any difference with respect to the agent per se, it would seem like if actually saving his daughter's life counts as a choice then merely attempting to should as well. Now the outcome does indeed matter to us, but all we can do is try. Being a potent agent requires such things as attempting to model external reality as best we can, attempting to train our own capabilities to acquire skillsets we can use, and learning our own capabilities and limitations. We could, however, model this as an idea leading to an action, where action is a goal based behavior. We could also model the action leading to an outcome; it just doesn't seem relevant to free will mechanics per se. 

In my own experience, it is impossible to make any statement or construct an argument that cannot be refuted. In other words, someone can always refute any statement or argument that you make, either logically or otherwise. And therefore, the infinite-regress problem cannot be solved by arguments and appeals to reason. 

Sophistry and rhetoric are methods of dialogue associated with ancient Greeks like Socrates and Plato, wherein one engages in dialogue with the express purpose of making the other person contradict himself and seem foolish. I believe that those who are prepared for proselytizing are trained in a system in dialogue that is more-or-less the same as sophistry. The person intended to be proselytized is led to imagine that he is engaging in an open and casual conversation about the comparative validity of his own religion, and that of the proselytizer. However, it is not "just" a conversation because the proselytizer has the deadly-serious agenda of converting the other person, while the other person usually does not have any agenda for being in the conversation. Also, the proselytizer may have back-up persons such as priest who brief and debrief him about such conversations for hours, and prepare him to hold various conversations or even to lure him to the temple/mosque/church or other place of worship of the proselytizer/converter, and into the company of more converters who may play various roles in the convertee's social life, such as accuser, sympathizer, good-cop-bad-cop, devil's advocate, girlfriend, boyfriend, etc. The thrust of the proselytizer's conversations with the intended convertee is to seem utterly logical, tolerant and compassionate, so as not to provoke any defensiveness on his part. A key element is to induce him to relate to the proselytizer, and share negative confidences about his family, friends, social setup and co-religionists. As a result of a series of interactions, the intended convertee often feels a sense of euphoria that he is surrounded by a bunch of new friends who understand him and are genuinely interested in the problems of his life, his emotional angst, etc., and give him the importance that he feels that he deserves. He contrasts this with his family members and his older friends, who seem relatively indifferent, uncaring and dismissive, and he feels driven towards the decision that his future happiness lies in proving himself loyal to his new friends by embracing their faith. Due to his frequent interactions with the proselytizers, the intended convertee may actually feel guilty for postponing his conversion to the new religion, which seems to be eagerly waiting with open arms. His old religion, by contrast, appears utterly lifeless and nondescript, and his family ties (which may break due to his conversion) don't seem worth maintaining at this point of his life. A great deal of the proselytizer's conversation may be aimed at fomenting a sense of grievance against the convertee's co-religionists, and a spirit of discontentment and rebellion. "Show them that you are willing to part company with all that is untrue and unworthy in your life," the proselytizers seem to say. If the intended convertee happens to be undergoing a bad patch in his life, or a transition phase such as adolescent rebellion, midlife crisis, joblessness, discontentment with marriage, etc, then the opportunity to 'make a clean break' with his life may seem too good to pass up. The possibility of being enabled to remarry or restructure his business, or find employment within the new community's network, is seductive. Converting seems like the only decent, rational and beneficial thing to do. Not converting threatens his newfound friendships, happiness and progress in his life. [My answer is intended to provoke discussion. It is illustrative of the environment set up by proselytizers, rather than the actual arguments themselves. This is admittedly not a classification of the kinds of arguments used by proselytizers, but it hopefully sets the stage for examining and classifying them.] 

The argument above isn't meant to be taken seriously (see the passage); it's simply an example of how "a few questions" can reduce "the rest of mankind" into "hopeless confusion". 

The past does not exist (it may have existed in the past, but it's now gone) The future does not exist (it may at some point, but it doesn't now) The present, however, does exist. The present is just an instant; it has no duration. (Just rephrasing "within the present there is no lapse in time?"). By 1, 2, 3, and 4, the only thing that exists is this present instant. That implies that time (i.e., "the passage of time") does not really exist (because there's no room in "the only thing that exists", that being an instant of time, to have such things as "flow of time"). 

This isn't entirely correct. For free will as we think of it to be viable, we must allow for external influences. If the guy at the counter offers me vanilla or chocolate, I must appeal to my mastery of the English language to comprehend his offerings; my learning of English is in large part an external influence. It's also very likely that I'll be strongly affected by my preference of taste; this requires at some point in time access to gustatory memories of tasting each, which is an external influence. Pretty much all experiences I refer to and skillsets I invoke are set at least in part by external influences. What you're referring to here is only a specific class of external influences; those that compel actions. What exactly constitutes a compelled action is an unresolved issue. Here are three perspectives: 

Sense of control as a gratuitous illusion to placate the conscious mind makes no sense (it fails to account for ability to manipulate our environments as we do, and for the fact that we don't in fact always seem to be in control). Sense of control as an actual sensation of intention does; in particular, models exist whereby at the low level an intention drives an action via a schema, and this action has a predicted result. The environment is monitored during the action by senses; if the predicted result is close, we sense control and may compensate for small errors. If it's too far off, we sense lack of control. So I'm going to start off by claiming that what you're calling the mainstream view has problems at other levels; what's really happening in the phenomenology of action is a bit more complex. Sense of control isn't primarily a fabrication to placate the conscious mind.
