Typically I can catch well before the rim starts bottoming out without looking. If the bike ever feels "off" I will give a quick check by it plopping my self down on the saddle. If the tire is going down this will usually bottom out the rim which I know shouldn't be happening. At this point I start visually checking things. If the bike feels a bit soft (I.e., we have lost some pressure but not enough to bottom out the rim) I will give it a quick visual by looking at the tire bulge when I bounce on the saddle. Finally if the bike feels solid I know it's my imagination and continue riding. 

There are so many factors involved that can lead to back pain that I would be suspicious of anyone providing the answer. Some factors that can affect Your current bike fit. 

Note we are talking about a incredibly light tread pattern (scuffing a tire is enough). We are not talking about deep channel wells or off-road knobbies. Also this is likely a secondary effect compared to tire compound which most manufactures have been chasing now for the last few decades. For another good discussion on light tread pattern and interlocking see Jan Heine's Optimizing Tire Tread article. 

Ultimately top end power comes from a combination of strength and muscle coordination (i.e., muscle recruitment patterns and mental focus). Strength training can be an important contributing component, helping develop your fast twitch (type II) muscle fibers which provide the required strength, but it will not guarantee top end power. You will also have to practice the coordination and mental focus required to produce high end power (i.e., > 1000 watts) on the bike (i.e., the specificity principle). The ability to focus and fire as many applicable muscle fibers as possible to complete a task is what often sets the pros apart from everyday riders (Martin et al. 2016). In terms of weight training itself, form is probably far more important than weight lifted. Most will focus on the weight as it is an easy to compare metric, try to avoid this pitfall as it often leads to bad or less than ideal form (even if you avoid "outrageous" weights). Light weight does not mean less of a work out as you can make lighter weights “heavier” by focusing on explosive power/speed, which is however something that should only be done after first mastering the form which itself can take a considerable amount of time. Squats, lunges and other such exercises need a healthy dose of glutes to be done correctly and on average cyclists have notoriously poor glute development. Its too bad as the glutes are important muscles acting as an antagonist for the hip flexors. Many cyclists suffer from chronically tight hip flexors, which can often be fixed with basic glute exercises. Glute recruitment during pedaling is also important for generating the big power you are looking for (high end power is not all quads). Being that you are a cyclist and probably sit a lot (many of us are forced to with modern lifestyles) its probably a pretty safe bet that your glutes could probably first use some development before you even jump into things like squats. If and when you feel that you are ready for squats (also consider other exercises like lunges, both straight on and lateral lunges - another huge weakness in cyclists), I would start with very light weight and focus on form and how your hips are functioning. The body is very adaptable and can find a way to "complete" a task using poor form. This is where a good trainer is key, to ensure you are performing the task properly. I would not simply go to a gym and start squatting weights with the hope of cranking out 1600 watts on the next club sprint. This is something honed over time. If you start with poor form you will not only train muscle imbalances, but you will also be reinforcing poor muscle coordination often associated with poor form. This in turn will result in poor functioning, which can eventually lead to injury (e.g., lower back) and a long road to recovery as now you have to fix the injury, retrain your muscle firing patterns, which is no small task in of itself, and then finally train the correct muscles and muscle firing patterns themselves. So again it would be advisable to work with some professionals to ensure you start your program properly. Also keeping the weight light and focusing on form (e.g., can you feel your glutes working, how are your hips functioning, what is your lower back doing, when do your quads kick in, how is your knee alignment, etc) you can also master when to work in strength training into your current routine. You will likely need enough rest prior so that you can do the strength training well, you also likely need sufficient rest afterwards so that you can perform well on your next bike training session. For example killing yourself strength training in the morning followed by a interval or sprint interval training in the afternoon probably isn't always a good combo - but could be depending on your abilities and goals. Some people can handle a high back to back workload days, while others cannot. It really depends on your fitness, genetics, age, diet, mental focus, personality... the list goes on. If you have a power meter you can measure first hand how you respond to different work out structures, allowing you to fine tune your routine. This is essentially the type of services a good coach should provide as part of the for pay service. 

I would be genuinely surprised if it made any real-world difference. Some racers commit all sorts of voodoo... err... questionable practices on the off chance it might give them an advantage. In terms of 23 vs 25 mm tires, both sizes are frequently used by pro tour teams, if one had a distinct advantage over the other you wouldn't see both sizes being used at the same events. It terms of aerodynamics, even for sizes up to 32 mm there doesn't seem to be much difference in aerodynamics drag. In terms of comfort getting the right tire pressure for your body weight will likely have a bigger effect than 2mm gain in the tire width. Other disadvantages include complications introduced into the assembly and supply chain for the manufacturer, which would eat into profits. 

Update I wanted to thank everyone for their ideas and feedback.I am currently shopping the idea of a central light give-away with various local sponsors. The best target will be in the area around the major city I live in as it has the highest density of cyclists. That said, I actually work out in a smaller community, which will likely be missed in any give away due to the lower volume of cyclists. So I am continuing to work on my technique for the ones I encounter here. Tonight I was able to give one to a older stealth cyclist who refused me in the past (and who was actually the impetus for this post). I just extra time striking up a conversation and was a bit more persuasive in my sell job. Also I made an extra effort to communicate that there were no strings were attached (mainly in my tone and some small comments about the origins of the lights - Moᶎ's "unknown provenance." I will also see if a small light gift certificate is an easier give-away. 

A lot of causal riders appear to prefer SPD's, which is a great place to start, but I here is the argument for SPD-SL like systems. Which I personally prefer and even on dirty muddy roads. Road bike specific pedals (e.g., SPD-SL) are designed for a single purpose, road cycling, and the pedals do this job well. Road cycling has a lot of repetitive motions (you often sit in the same position for a long period of time) so fit can be key to reducing repetitive stress injuries. If you get into long rides, high mileage or fast and hard rides you will notice the difference over mountain bike pedals. Because you change your position quite often in mountain biking the small nuance issues of fit in road cycling are often a non-issue in endurance mountain biking. Pros - Road Pedals (SPD-SL and others) 

Event 1: Low end 10-speed market dominance Chasing the popularity of road racing and riders, such as Eddie Merckx, the 70's and 80's featured a flood of cheap 10 speed road bike knock-offs that had the primary goal looking similar to the types of bikes that Eddy Merckx et al. were riding at the time. These bikes featured drop bars with poor ergonomics and frames that likely had too low a stack height for mainstream riders. Because these bikes did not fit most people very well, the general public was left with the impression drop bars were uncomfortable and should only be ridden in very aggressive positions. Event 2: Explosion of MTB bikes in the 80's and 90's The mountain bike explosion of the 80's and 90's further maligned drop bars. These bikes featured more upright riding positions due their off-road nature which most people found more comfortable. While early incarnations of mountain bikes featured drop bars (Figure 1), straight bars quickly became a fixed feature (likely for the improved leverage - although this is speculative on my part).
