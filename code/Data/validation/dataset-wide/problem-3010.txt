This all said, once you have some basic vocabulary for talking about propositions, it's time to stop studying logic and get back to talking, listening, reading, and writing. That's mainly how you learn to communicate through language: by communicating through language, not by memorizing rules about it or learning words to talk about it. A little bit of "meta" goes a long way; a lot of "meta" just gets you muddled.* There are many aspects of what is expressed in language that are not covered well by any theory of logic that I've ever heard of. For example, emphasis in language communicates something important, but most logicians take no interest in it. The tense system of English requires that you understand temporal relationships in a certain peculiar way. The past tense of English often indicates hypothetical propositions—imagined to become true in the future, even. Logic can give you some helpful vocabulary for making sense of this, but ultimately the details of language must be understood subconsciously, through experience. They're too complex to fully understand consciously. 

* If you want to push further, and you're willing to accept getting muddled, then please don't let this message discourage you. Often getting muddled is a step toward learning something valuable, which you couldn't even imagine before you spent a long time muddled. But then you shouldn't think of it as a means to an end known in advance, you should think of it as indulging your curiosity and following it wherever it leads. 

Sure. None have been successful though. 1 He who wants to attack a praxeological theorem has to trace it back, step by step, until he reaches a point in which, in the chain of reasoning that resulted in the theorem concerned, a logical error can be unmasked. But if this regressive process of deduction ends at the category of action without having discovered a vicious link in the chain of reasoning, the theorem is fully confirmed. Those positivists who reject such a theorem without having subjected it to this examination are no less foolish than those seventeenth-century astronomers were who refused to look through the telescope that would have shown them that Galileo was right and they were wrong. — Ludwig von Mises, Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, p.70 2 "The essence of logical positivism is to deny the cognitive value of a priori knowledge by pointing out that all a priori propositions are merely analytic. They do not provide new information, but are merely verbal or tautological, asserting what has already been implied in the definitions and premises. Only experience can lead to synthetic propositions. There is an obvious objection against this doctrine, viz., that this proposition that there are no synthetic a priori propositions is in itself —as the present writer thinks, false— a synthetic a priori proposition, for it can manifestly not be established by experience." — Ludwig von Mises, The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, pg. 5 3 “The attempt to disprove the action-axiom would itself be an action aimed at a goal, requiring means, excluding other courses of action, incurring costs, subjecting the actor to the possibility of achieving or not achieving the desired goal and so leading to a profit or a loss. And the very possession of such knowledge then can never be disputed, and the validity of these concepts can never be falsified by any contingent experience, for disputing or falsifying anything would already have presupposed their very existence. As a matter of fact, a situation in which these categories of action would cease to have a real existence could itself never be observed, for making an observation, too, is an action.” — Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Economic Science and the Austrian Method 

I can tell you some of the main, useful ideas of traditional logic right here. A proposition is the kind of thing that's true or false: an affirmation or denial that something is a certain way—that some abstract quality or relationship belongs to some indicated subject. Propositions usually correspond to sentences in language. For example, the words "My cat Jerome usually checks out the contents of the refrigerator whenever I open the door" expresses a proposition about my cat Jerome and his usual behavior when I open the refrigerator door. It's true if he does that, and false if he doesn't. A term is one of the elements of a proposition, like my cat Jerome, his behavior, the refrigerator, etc. Terms are not true or false. You can verify that to yourself by using the word or words for one without making a complete sentence. For example, "Jerome". See? Not true or false. A proposition has a subject: what it claims something about. And a proposition has a predicate: what it says about it—what is affirmed or denied of the subject. Predicates are always abstractions, like qualities, relations, actions in the abstract, etc.; subjects can be concrete or abstract. In a simple example, like "Jerome is fat", the subject is "Jerome" and the predicate is "fat". Notice that in language, "Jerome" is a proper noun: a name for a specific thing; and "fat" is a common noun, a name for an abstraction. In more-complex propositions, you have some flexibility in what you call the subject and what you call the predicate. In the example above, you could say that the subject is Jerome's usual behavior around the refrigerator door when I open it, and the predicate is checking out the contents. Or you could say that the subject is just Jerome, and the predicate is everything else. It doesn't matter a whole lot; what matters is that you understand what is being affirmed or denied: that you understand what is about talked about and what is being said about it. If you can understand that, you understand the literal meaning of a sentence that expresses it. Regarding negation, there are two kinds: denial, in which a whole proposition is negated, like "Jerome doesn't poke his nose in the refrigerator", and negation of a term or part of a term: "Jerome quickly becomes bored with things that he can't eat." That he can't eat restricts things, so the proposition doesn't say anything about whether Jerome quickly becomes bored with things he can eat. A negative proposition makes a claim: that its predicate does not belong to its subject—and so a negative proposition is true or false, just like an affirmative proposition. Negation of a term or part of a term restricts the scope of the term, and isn't true or false. "Things that he can't eat." See? Not true or false. Negation gets complicated when you try to follow the implications of negating something on what's inside it. For example, think of what happens when you negate the proposition "Jerome doesn't care about things that he can't eat." That would be: "Jerome does care about…um…things that he can eat?" Nope, it doesn't work like that. To affirm what the first proposition denies, you just say "Jerome does care about things he can't eat." Negation gets complicated when you consider something called quantification: whether you are referring to all, some, none, just one, most, a few, etc. of something, and whether you are saying that an instance exists or not. Symbolic logic shines at this, but it follows a convention that's mostly suitable for math; traditional logic follows a convention that's more suitable for ordinary matters (and terrible for math). But basically, the negation of "At least once, Jerome has eaten food that doesn't belong to him" is "Jerome has never eaten food that doesn't belong to him." This is one place where the subject can get legitimately complicated—more than I can explain even in a long message like this. You don't need a "calculus", and you should not treat traditional logic as a calculus. People often speak of translating sentences "into logic", then manipulating them according to the rules of logic, and then translating back. The standard criticism of traditional logic is that, when treated as a calculus, it can't determine the validity of certain kinds of deductive inference. Of course, the same is true of symbolic logic; it can't substitute for reasoning, either. Some writings on traditional logic treat it as a calculus for deductive reasoning, just like symbolic logic. I recommend ignoring that. Traditional logic is not a calculus, and does not presume to distinguish all valid inferences from all invalid inferences. The main value of traditional logic is to give you some vocabulary to help distinguish important aspects of what people mean when they say sentences. If you understand the difference between subject and predicate, then you've learned to focus your attention on some aspects of sentences that are genuinely useful to distinguish. These concepts focus on the substance of what is meant, not on nit-picky technicalities of wording or which jargon term to use to talk about it. If you just ask yourself, "What is this person talking about, and what are they saying about it?," that alone is often fruitful when sorting out confusion. And that's plenty. There are some more useful things to know in logic, traditional and otherwise, but if you understand that much, I'd say you're ready to declare victory. 

"The whole controversy is, however, meaningless when applied to praxeology. It refers essentially to geometry. Its present state, especially its treatment by logical positivism, has been deeply influenced by the shock that Western philosophy received from the discovery of non-Euclidian geometries. Before Bolyai and Lobachevsky, geometry was, in the eyes of the philosophers, the paragon of perfect science; it was assumed that it provided unshakable certainty forever and for everybody. To proceed also in other branches of knowledge more geometrico was the great ideal of truth-seekers. All traditional epistemological concepts began to totter when the attempts to construct non-Euclidian geometries succeeded. Yet praxeology is not geometry. It is the worst of all superstitions to assume that the epistemological characteristics of one branch of knowledge must necessarily be applicable to any other branch. In dealing with the epistemology of the sciences of human action, one must not take one’s cue from geometry, mechanics, or any other science. The assumptions of Euclid were once considered as self-evidently true. Present-day epistemology looks upon them as freely chosen postulates, the starting point of a hypothetical chain of reasoning. Whatever this may mean, it has no reference at all to the problems of praxeology. The starting point of praxeology is a self-evident truth, the cognition of action, that is, the cognition of the fact that there is such a thing as consciously aiming at ends. There is no use cavilling about these words by referring to philosophical problems that have no bearing upon our problem. The truth of this cognition is as self-evident and as indispensable for the human mind as is the distinction between A and non-A.” — Ludwig von Mises, The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, p.5 

In my experience, both with myself and watching others, symbolic logic doesn't help except in computer science and a little in math. Usually when people learn symbolic logic, they acquire skill at playing a game with symbols, something like playing checkers or WFF ’N PROOF, but no skill at understanding concepts, propositions, or reasoning. If anything, symbolic logic hurts, because it uses the vocabulary that ordinarily describes thought to describe the meaningless symbol game, making it harder to talk about the former. Many people have told me that after they took a course in symbolic logic in college, they did not see what it had to do with reasoning, nor did they see any use in it, and they quickly forgot the rules for fiddling with the symbols. Outside of computer science, almost no one uses symbolic logic for anything except symbolic logic. It's just too hard, too abstract, too far removed from the rest of the world. Traditional logic has its faults, but it provides straightforward and intuitive vocabulary for talking about stuff like what sentences mean. Traditional logic is never far from traditional grammar, which is mostly concerned to identify how logical relationships are expressed in language. (Modern grammar is primarily concerned with syntax: rules to distinguish legal from illegal ways to combine words into sentences—not what you need if you want to gain skill at understanding what sentences mean.) Unfortunately, I don't know of a good book to strongly recommend to learn traditional logic. I picked it up from a variety of sources. One of those was Raymond McCall’s book Basic Logic, which is decent, though rather dry, has so-so examples, and occasionally has an axe to grind. I've only read a little of the Port-Royal Logic, but what I read was absolutely delightful: the examples came from poetry, history, wisdom, and ordinary life. The prose was playful, intelligent, and unabashedly opinionated. The authors were concerned to elucidate thought, not merely to play games or split hairs. I'd say the Port-Royal Logic is probably the best source to look at first. Watch out for books on traditional logic that emphasize the syllogism. Some of them treat memorizing valid forms of the syllogism as the main point of logic: learning to tell valid from invalid deductive reasoning—by, of all things, memorizing lists of syllogistic forms. That's useless. The most important thing is to learn the conceptual vocabulary and a few principles. The rest is triviality. 

Some points: Universality: We shouldn't assume that expletives all match English usage. Taking Catullus as an example, that curses in Latin often were not merely shocking as they are in English, they were often degrading and involved accusing the other party of being less than others. Effectiveness: Have you ever seen an argument won this way? 

There are, of course, many different kinds of atheists. The question you raise about existence, self, mind, and so on can be more generally asked as "Do atheists believe in the actual existence of abstract objects?" The answer to this is that it is not necessarily a theist vs. atheist issue but what are one's beliefs about metaphysics. Your next question I take to mean "If atheists are relativists, isn't it contradictory to say that an atheist is absolutely certain about something?" There are two problems with this that I see. First, there are objectivist atheists (Ayn Rand comes to mind). Second, the notion of "relativism" normally is only concerned with non-material things like morality. Most atheists that I've read have no problem being absolutely certain about, for example, the physical properties of an object. 

Since you asked about the context, I think there's a very important point about Epictetus: "No writings of Epictetus himself are really known." So, how do we know of this particular saying? It appears in a work simply known as "Fragments" of "Fragments of Epictetus." So, we don't have a full explanation of the context. We can guess though from Epictetus's position as a stoic that it comes from a position of focusing on one's self and what one can control instead of working to impress others by one's words. 

It is unnecessary. Praxeology: The Methodology of Austrian Economics by Murray N. Rothbard ...Moreover, even if verbal economics could be successfully translated into mathematical symbols and then translated into English so as to explain the conclusions, the process makes no sense and violates the great scientific principle of Occam’s Razor: avoiding unnecessary multiplication of entities… ...Although himself a mathematical economist, the mathematician son of Carl Menger wrote a trenchant critique of the idea that mathematical presentation in economics is necessarily more precise than ordinary language: Consider, for example, the statements (2) To a higher price of a good, there corresponds a lower (or at any rate not a higher) demand. (2') If p denotes the price of, and q the demand for, a good, then q = f(p) and dq/dp = f' (p) ≤ 0 Those who regard the formula (2') as more precise or "more mathematical" than the sentence (2) are under a complete misapprehension … the only difference between (2) and (2') is this: since (2') is limited to functions which are differentiable and whose graphs, therefore, have tangents (which from an economic point of view are not more plausible than curvature), the sentence (2) is more general, but it is by no means less precise: it is of the same mathematical precision as (2'). Mathematics versus Economic Logic by Ludwig von Mises ...The deliberations which result in the formulation of an equation are necessarily of a nonmathematical character. The formulation of the equation is the consummation of our knowledge; it does not directly enlarge our knowledge. […] No such constant relations exist, however, between economic elements. The equations formulated by mathematical economics remain a useless piece of mental gymnastics and would remain so even it they were to express much more than they really do. ...The mathematical method is at a loss to show how, from a state of nonequilibrium, those actions spring up which tend toward the establishment of equilibrium. It is, of course, possible to indicate the mathematical operations required for the transformation of the mathematical description of a definite state of nonequilibrium into the mathematical description of the state of equilibrium. But these mathematical operations by no means describe the market process actuated by the discrepancies in the price structure. The differential equations of mechanics are supposed to describe precisely the motions concerned at any instant of the time traveled through. The economic equations have no reference whatever to conditions as they really are in each instant of the time interval between the state of nonequilibrium and that of equilibrium. Only those entirely blinded by the prepossession that economics must be a pale replica of mechanics will underrate the weight of this objection. A very imperfect and superficial metaphor is not a substitute for the services rendered by logical economics... 

Since Thomas's argument does not use only material evidence (and that which can be logically derived from it), it must be wrong in Dawkins's eyes. 

Those are just three examples, but I could keep going. It seems then that as a practical matter, the problem you pose of having a complicated ethical framework that doesn't pass some basic (by the author's own criteria) sanity check at the end of its construction is generally not an issue, as philosophers build ethical systems bit-by-bit, testing whether what they've said makes sense along the way, checking that the most basic issues are handled in the beginning. 

The point of the remark is to explain the subsequent comments from Ctesippus concerning why he treats his dog so poorly, that is, because his dog isn't a very good one. 

I think the problem comes from our natural overloading the word "is." Consider instead it's two possible meanings: 

There are cases where an individual's self interest hurts someone else, for example, when they are competing for some common thing). There are cases when an individual's self interest benefits someone else, for example when someone is able to specialize in performing some task or providing some product, and trades that product or service to someone else who needs it. 

He discusses the topic at length, but the two above excerpts get to the heart of it: it is not that God cannot decide one thing and later change His mind out of inability, it is that God, in His one defining eternal act has already acted with perfection.
