If you are truly set on not forwarding the resume, something like "I'm sorry, but I don't know you well enough to feel comfortable forwarding your resume. I hope you understand. And here's a link to our website where you can apply for yourself [include link here]." would probably work. That said, I usually take a different approach. If I know someone professionally, I'm happy to pass along their resume in almost all cases. If I do, I may indicate that I don't actually know this person well, nor am I recommending them, depending on what I think of this person's abilities. I see absolutely no harm in that. 

Because "a bit thin" in this case apparently doesn't mean "too thin to consider hiring this candidate". Nobody wants to waste their own time. Accept it at face value that this person has not ruled you out from consideration. 

You can ask, but it's almost certainly a waste of time. Particularly since you received only a 1.3% raise, then money is most likely not the issue here. People are put on a PIP for performance reasons, not monetary reasons. And asking for a lower salary won't make the PIP go away. You can search and find other questions and answers about PIPs. But unfortunately, being on a PIP is almost always the step before being let go. In many companies, it's a formality that HR requires, but the results are inevitable. Start looking for a new job immediately. As you interview, try to see if you can find a company that meets your current needs (less multi-tasking, etc). At the same time, read and understand all of the details required in your PIP. If there's any slight chance that you will be retained, you must complete all of the PIP details required to the letter and on time. More likely, you can get a decent recommendation after you are let go, based on trying as hard as you can during your PIP period. These things happen. Sometimes employees just aren't a good fit for a particular position. The company may simply need someone proficient at multi-tasking, and that may not be you. The fact that it takes 60 hours to complete your week's work is a strong indicator. You want to leave on as good terms as you can. Fulfilling the PIP as best you can will help. 

In the Company Name field, put "Self-employed". In the Title field, just put "Independent Freelance Consultant". In the Description field, add detailed explanation of this role. 

That depends on your locale, local laws, your contract, and the company culture. If the employer is free to fire you at any time during probation with no notice, then I would assume that you are free to do the same and leave with no notice. All of the contracts with probation periods that I have seen work that way. 

You can resign as gracefully and professionally as you would have, had the senior-most team member not already resigned. The fact that these two events happened in close temporal proximity is not your fault, and should not be of much concern. Just be professional and don't bad-mouth the company. The remaining folks will think whatever they are going to think anyway. The first resignation is often the most surprising, but subsequent resignations won't likely be panic-inducing. (And I'm sure you suspect you won't be the last to leave anyway.) 

I have always felt that being direct, honest, and open avoids most hard feelings. Your offer was based on the value you place on the position, and the potential you see in the individual to (eventually) fill the requirements of the position. Don't get into a comparison war with a friend's salary. Unless this friend currently works for you in an identical position, what some friend makes at some other company isn't relevant for what you want to pay for the position, so don't bother discussing it. Point out that you value this individual based on his/her performance so far, and that you believe eventually she/he will grow into the position, but that right now they don't have the qualifications and experience that would warrant the salary he/she is seeking. Talk about the kind of career growth you see in this position, and the benefits your company provides. Finally, decide if you can offer any more than you already have, or if your offer is firm. Then be ready to deal with the response. Thoughtful honesty should never hurt people's feelings. 

You can ask for anything. I'm guessing a company in financial difficulties won't give you much, but it never hurts to ask. In addition to what you have already suggested: 

You should probably just politely decline. Personally, I doubt that declining would be held against you. I believe most of these things are honest attempts by HR to do its job in finding ways to retain talent, provide benefits that matter, and build an effective workforce. Good HR groups make it safe for individuals to say anything - the bad as well as the good - and thereby elicit honest feedback. Good anonymization, aggregation of answers, and making sure management is out of the picture while opinions are sought can go a long way to conveying a sense of mutual trust. Clearly, there are some underhanded HR departments and individuals, but I think the majority are at least trying, even if some of their approaches are rather foolish, ham-handed or even downright creepy. You can certainly ask about how this "Interview" information will be gathered, and how it will be used. You can ask if it will be anonymized, and who will see the results. You can even ask if you will see the results for yourself. My company performs an annual "Great Place to Work" assessment which isn't quite the same as this sort of interview, but is related. The online results are anonymized, grouped by department and summarized up several levels. Since some of the departments/teams are quite small, several employees regularly choose not to participate, as they feel that the process isn't as anonymous as it could be. I always participated. But when I saw the results, I could often tell who wrote some of the "free form" answers. They clearly weren't trying to hide anything and used the same wording as they do in conversations and emails. Since you are already skeptical, you very well might be better served by avoiding a situation that could make you feel uncomfortable. When we are uncomfortable, we often say the wrong thing and make a situation worse. Find a reason to be busy at that time if you must, or even be out of the office. If this is something you simply can't duck, then simply decline to actually answer any question that you aren't comfortable with (the answer "Oh, I can't think of anything" seems to work well). If you spill your guts, you probably won't feel good afterwards and will worry - it's not worth it. 

I am not a lawyer, nor do I play one on television. But, barring something to the contrary contained in your contract, it is my understanding that your California employer can require indeed you to work in the office, rather than remotely. Yahoo (headquartered in Sunnyvale, CA) reversed their remote work policy not too long ago. And if you cannot come into the office for some reason, and aren't permitted to work remotely, it's my understanding that your employer can indeed force you to take a day off - using up accrued vacation time, personal time, or sick time as dictated by the rules in your company. 

Clearly you have already concluded that you have no viable alternative. If that's true, then there is no question here - you have to do what you have to do. 

You can negotiate anything you are willing to work for. You already talked with them (I assume politely). And you didn't get what you wanted right away. You could talk to them again and say that you aren't happy. But it doesn't sound like they care. I'd be surprised if they would give you a guaranteed increase after a certain date, if they aren't even willing to talk salary with you at all. 

Every situation is different. Every manager's personality is different. Everyone's level of trust is different. I tend to get very friendly with the people who work for me - particularly those who have been with me for a while. For me, socializing at work, with people who work for me, and with people I work for, is an important part of what makes work rewarding. I would be much less happy going to work every day, if I couldn't discuss life with my work friends. Regarding people who work for me, I know their families, they know mine. I've been to weddings, parties, and ceremonies with folks on my team. I've exchanged cards, I've exchanged gifts. I have long-lasting friendships with some. When I talk with them in our weekly one-on-one meetings, I always ask how things are going in general, including outside the office. I ask about their spouses and children. I ask what they are doing for the weekend. I want to know about what is important to them. When I hire someone new, I try to get a sense of how open they want to be with their lives outside of work. Only on a few occasions have I hired folks who aren't interested in talking about their lives, or hearing about mine. In those cases, I respect their desire for privacy. While I'm an introvert by nature, I try to be as friendly as I can at work. With my managers, I try to get a sense of how much I like and trust them, and then open up about my life outside of work with them. With most of my bosses, I've felt free to be open and honest about almost everything. In just a few cases, I could tell they weren't comfortable or weren't interested, and so didn't share with them. Only you can tell how much you trust your manager. Only you can sense what you are willing to share, and how much your manager wants to receive. Every manager-employee relationship is different. 

What you did was fine, and pretty smart. Dropping hints in all the right places can occasionally get the ball rolling on lots of ideas. Unfortunately it doesn't sound like you got much reaction from the CEO. Now you need to look for other ways to advance the topic. Perhaps HR does annual employee satisfaction surveys or discussion? If so, bring up the topic there. You might also happen to find a time to talk to the CEO in the future. Perhaps something like "I was thinking more about that 'work from home' idea recently. That's a benefit I know I'd appreciate, and I suspect the same would be true of many others. Any chance that could happen?" might work. 

Unless you are seeing an ad that is many months old, you are making a mistake. Unless it is specifically mentioned in the ad, you don't know how long the company will be looking to fill the position, nor if there are other, similar positions available. If you see a job that interests you, and for which you think you might be suitable, just apply. 

A follow up note is always a good thing. The emphasis of your follow-up note should be about thanking folks for the interview, on your fitness for the job, your enthusiasm about what you learned of the job and company, and your desire to move to the "next step" in the process. At most, you should only incidentally apologize for being late. As you said "excuses are a big no no", so don't offer them again. 

It does mean that (for the period during which you work for them and for the three years that follow). You get to decide if these terms are acceptable. If they are, then just sign it and plan to abide by the terms. If they aren't acceptable, you can attempt to negotiate them to acceptability. Unless you are bringing something highly desirable to the table, it's unlikely they will change the terms just for you. If these terms sound onerous, or if you really want to work for a competing company within the next three years, don't sign this form. Just move on and find a different job.
