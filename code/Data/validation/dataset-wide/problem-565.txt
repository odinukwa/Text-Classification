Answer: Mini-Pump in combination with a Track Pump. Read on for my experiences of 'Cyclaire' pumps... I purchased a 'Cyclaire' portable pump as I genuinely believed it would be the answer to all of my puncture/tyre care problems. It came with a neat bag that I could use to carry it on the bike and worked perfectly. However, on a day to day basis I carried a mini-pump and over time I forgot to dust off the 'Cyclaire' pump, to eventually never even think about taking it out for longer rides. If I was on tour with a group then I might just dig it out as it does have a gauge and high pressures can be achieved. This could be useful to maintain tyre pressures 2+ weeks in to an 'expedition'. As it is, I recommend a small plastic mini-pump for the road and a track pump for back home. The trick with the minipump is to get one where there are no extra gadget features, e.g. gauge, 2-way motion, telescopic barrel or any of that nonsense. These features can make the pump liable to rattle apart, rendering it useless when you need it. The simpler (but not necessarily cheaper) pump just keeps on giving. The portable pump only has to get you home, you can ride on 20 p.s.i. if that is all the minipump can give, back home you can then get the rest of it in effortlessly with a gauge to keep it correctly inflated. Maybe the 'Cycleaire' strays from 'keep it simple', as does the CO2 cannister. A workshop compressor is nice, but, unless you work in a bike shop and need one on the whole time, then you have to faff with it and wait for its cylinder to charge. For that reason, stick with the track pump (with gauge) and plain-as-possible mini-pump for on the road. If you really want a 'Cyclaire' pump then find a suitable scenario - either the long tour or, if you commute, inside your desk drawer. 

If you are negotiating an 'Alp worth' of switchbacks on a heavy bike with narrow rims there is a problem of heat. You can cook the brake blocks for them to suddenly have the stopping power of cheese on toast, maybe to send you out wide on a bend (if you are lucky). In rescuing your bike from the vegetation you may touch one of the rims for it to be too hot to handle. Although it is obvious that brakes get hot it is not necessarily an obvious consideration whilst you are otherwise doing a good job of descending. Broken bones and flesh wounds can be fixed by the doctors and nurses, what you want to avoid is traumatic brain injury where your brain smacks on the inside of the skull, bruises, swells up and leads to brain damage. With age brain damage becomes less sustainable in that you cannot recover from it in the way that those that suffer strokes recover brain function. Allegedly just falling over onto a hard surface can give your head a 15 mph whack, enough to ruin your brain for maybe a lifetime. A helmet will not change this sudden deceleration force significantly - your brain behaves much like a person not wearing a seatbelt in a car where crumple zones in the bonnet don't really help. Technically standing still is therefore 'dangerous' - you could faint and die, just like that. 'Feeling safe' has nothing to do with this technicality, but hey, if you are in the zone, on a cool road with no mechanical/traffic/weather/surface problems then 65 mph 'feels' fantastic and if you make it to the bottom in one piece then '65' is obviously safe... Perhaps a more logical way for a UK cyclist to look at the situation is the 'twenty is plenty' road safety campaign. This campaign is all about pedestrians and setting traffic speeds that are survivable for them. Getting hit by a car at 20mph as a pedestrian is probably similar to falling off a bike at 20 mph - a lot more survivable than 30 mph. 

I believe it is best to stick to the standards deemed appropriate by the experts on this matter. That means buying a tabard for less than a fiver from some place that sells work wear. That does not mean spending £30 to get some cyclist version of the high-visibility wear that does not pay attention to the EN471 standard. Let's stick to conventions Another really good reason to wear that greeny-yellow is that it is a convention. Motorists recognise cyclists as cyclists when wearing that particular colour. With flourescent pink they have to think about it, with orange they wonder if that is a dustman. 10% of us males are red/green colourblind! Orange was the original high visibility colour for railways in the UK. To get a job as a train driver you have to be able to see properly. Therefore orange worked very well, sticking to the convention of using orange as a hazard colour (with red as stop and green as go). There is no colour blindness test in the driving test. With one in ten males not able to discern red and green properly the yellow-green colour trumps the orange that is nearer red. Here is a study that goes into this in more depth: $URL$ And a couple of handy diagrams. This one has tarmac grey and 'ambient foliage' with a spectrum of bright colours: 

If a chain is only supposed to last 2000 miles, a rear cassette 5000 miles and a chainset only 10000 miles, then, at a modest 100 miles a week you are going to go through 2.5 chains a year, a new sprocket set every year and a new chainset every couple of years. Doing this near-constant refurbishment properly (and paying workshop rates) will mean paying for the bike twice-over in the first two years (or thereabouts). I have seen components advertised as lighter/stronger/funkier, but, as of yet, none have caught my eye due to their extended 'service life'. Are there any parts sold with 'service life' part of the USP? If not, why doesn't anyone want extended service life? Do none of us look past the thrill of having a new bike and look for something that will last? 

Most wholesalers carry generic 1 1/8" steerer forks with bosses for 'V' brakes and no suspension for 26" wheel. Your LBS will be able to get one in for you, pay £30 maximum for that in the UK and expect it in for you to collect in a week. (Most shops don't carry such items, just posh forks). You will need to cut the fork down, this is simple enough and gives you the option to stack up washers on the headset for the bars to be at the height you want. Typically replacement forks are painted black or chrome plated. Black paint will probably last better than chrome. For what it is worth I would avoid a second hand fork. You don't want to find out that it has crash damage. If you do things through your LBS then you are in a better position if you need help getting that lower bearing race fitted. Avoid suspension unless you are willing to pay real money. Forks with damping etc are really horrible bits of engineering even though they are seemingly popular. 

...just speaking up for the Local Bike Shop - if you are moving to Redmond permanently then it may make sense to have a bike with a warranty and the support of the LBS for when/if it goes wrong. Also consider the mudguards situation - I know they are unfashionable but they are handy for the commute. Since Specialized bikes are designed for sunny California where nobody could ever imagine needing mudguards, you may want to also post a question on what people recommend. You will only be cold if you get clothing that is not up to the job. You know the drill - baselayers, as many layers as you need on top and a breathable jacket. Overshoes and neoprene gloves optional... 

Square Taper chainsets do this, even if they get checked for tightness before sale. A 'free service' with the bike sometimes involves nothing more than tightening these fellas up. The problem of square taper crank arms coming loose was why Shimano came along with Octalink splined bottom brackets. I think you will be able to get away with just tightening up the cranks. A 15mm socket set is what you need, and gloves! (Or else you can smash up your hands or hurt your hand on the socket set lever.) You can also tighten up these bolts on the ground, back brake on, with a foot on the socket set lever at the 3 o'clock setting. Do both sides and don't bother taking them off or anything like that first. Opinions vary on whether you should have any grease in there, personally I have found grease to not do any harm, but, in general no grease is the norm. The reason your bike has the square taper design is that Shimano patented Octalink so it did not become an industry standard. If the problem persists then you might have already 'rounded' one or other of the crank arms. With the left-hand crank you can get a spare 170mm arm, although not necessarily to match the other arm.
