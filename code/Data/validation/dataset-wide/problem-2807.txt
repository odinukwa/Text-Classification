I think that Nietzche is criticising the usual misreading of Kantian indirect realism. I think that Kant in himself did not believe that "things in themselves" exist merely that we can't frame the world in any other way (he ignored other states of consciousness). Most scientists however to this day tend I believe to be indirect realists. E.g. see Banks (2012) summary of Blackmore's attack on Mach. "Blackmore contrasts [Mach's] phenomenalism with what he calls indirect realism, sometimes representative realism when he wishes to emphasize epistemology. On this view, we subscribe to a basic dualism: there is a real, mind-independent and objective external world of atoms, space and time, law and causality on which scientists can agree and of which they obtain knowledge through experiment and theorizing. On the other side are sensations, which differ from observer to observer, and are mental. We have only an indirect picture of the real world in our sensations, which, though mental, are linked somehow to external reality via a causal chain, or representative theory of perception. According to Blackmore, all scientists Descartes, Galileo, Locke, Newton, Planck, Einstein, along with all right-thinking ‘‘practical people’’(?) are partisans of indirect realism. It is true that we all fall backward into na¨ıve realism from time to time, mistaking our sensations of objects for the real objects external to our minds, but, like Empedocles, we quickly learn that what we see and taste is different from what others see and taste in the same object, and so we learn to be indirect realists instead." Mach may be one of the five or six minds that Nietzsche refers to. I think that Nietzsche's position is one of radical humility. Nietzsche, F. (1873). On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense. Truth: Engagements Across Philosophical Traditions, 14–25. Retrieved from www.austincc.edu/adechene/Nietzsche%20on%20truth%20and%20... " See p.1. "Once upon a time, in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems, there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowledge. That was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of "world history," but nevertheless, it was only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths, the star cooled and congealed, and the clever beasts had to die. " Nietzsche, F. (1968). The Will to Power. (Kaufmann, Walter & Hollingdale, Richard, Trans.). New York, NY: Vintage."to demand that our human interpretations and values should be universal and perhaps constitutive values is one of the hereditary madnesses of human pride" p. 305 (i.e. there are no things in themselves. Kant might agree, but most scientists think there is some sort of Matrix out there) I think that with a sensible level of humility, bearing in mind our utter ^100 insignificance, the "out there" should be, and is, so beyond our ken as to be best called "chaos," but we pretend to know the maximum speed, and the beginning of the universe. Mach may have believed in "neutral monism" that both the true world of science, and sensations exist (this is debatable). Nietzsche called bs on the true world, out there. Nietzsche said all we have are our sensations and useful rules of thumb. All we have are sensations and engineering because our formations are radically limited by our "gnat" intellect. We are no different from our "bricoleur" forebears. 

I cannot see why ex contradictione quodlibet should be thought a problem, since no contradiction can be true. So what if everything follows from a true contradiction? There aren't any true contradictions. There can't be any. (To think otherwise betrays a failure to understand negation.) So you'll never get actual explosion. Ex falso quodlibet is more of an apparent problem, since then "If the moon is made of green cheese, then tiny purple unicorns prance on Mars" becomes a true conditional. One wants to ask what the moon's being made of green cheese could possibly have to do with tiny purple unicorns' prancing on Mars. But it's the conditional that is true when the antecedent is false; nothing says that one can somehow deduce the consequent from the antecedent. Still, if this bothers one, he may always switch to a presuppositional conditional--one which simply has no truth-value when its antecedent is false. In fact, the perceived problem arises from treating the material conditional as though it were presuppositional and thinking, "Gee, if 'if the moon is made of green cheese, then tiny purple unicorns prance on Mars' is true, that means that were it really true that the moon was made of green cheese it would also be really true that tiny purple unicorns pranced on Mars!" But the truth-functional material conditional is different from the presuppositional conditional. One might think this a fault with interpreting the ordinary, everyday conditional as the material conditional, of course. I've been trying to find purported examples of true contradictions in order to show that they are not really true or are not really contradictions. If people send you examples, I'd love to know what they are. In the consecutive-sevens-in-the-expansion-of-pi example, the word "know" is being equivocated upon. "We know there are a million consecutive sevens" is defensible as likely to be true, under the conditions given, so "know" only means "know beyond a reasonable doubt." "We don't know there are a million consecutive sevens" is defensible as false only if "know" means "know beyond any doubt whatsoever." "The Way that can be named is not the Way" is not a contradiction. It does not say "The Way is not the Way." It says something like "The-Way-that-can-be-named is not the-Way-that-I-have-in-mind." The former referent differs from the latter referent. "This six-foot professional basketball player is very tall" is true if "tall" means "taller than five-foot ten inches" but false if "tall" means "taller than six-foot two inches." Whether or not it is a true sentence depends on what one means by his words. And that's always the case: a sentence isn't true or false on its own, but is true or false under an interpretation. We try to speak clearly enough that we all give sentences the same interpretations, but sometimes we don't, and then we may end up thinking we disagree when we agree or that we agree when we disagree, just because we're interpreting the same sentence in different ways. We must always stipulate a fixed meaning and then assign a truth-value, if the sentence has one under that fixed interpretation. In the Nagarjuna example: "If Nāgārjuna is correct in his critique of essence, and if it thus turns out that all things lack fundamental natures, it turns out that they all have the same nature, that is, emptiness, and hence both have and lack that very nature. This is a direct consequence of the purely negative character of the property of emptiness, a property Nāgārjuna first fully characterizes, and the centrality of which to philosophy he first demonstrates." But either all things lack fundamental nature and therefore emptiness is not their nature, or all things have the same fundamental nature of emptiness. If by "emptiness" is meant "the lack of a fundamental nature," then it is true both that all things lack fundamental nature and that all things "have emptiness," i.e., lack fundamental nature. It is not a contradiction but rather a tautology. Only by denying all things fundamental nature and then treating emptiness as though it were a fundamental nature does the apparent contradiction arise. Of course, it's possible that some human beings hold contradictory beliefs--but that's far different from contradictory beliefs' being simultaneously true.
