I think modern scientific circles regard just about anything as a conduit for pseudoscience these days. However, I don't think holism is given any special treatment. If you consider the ultra-pure-ivory-tower version of science, where you develop a hypothesis about the tiniest facet of the universe and then spend an infinite amount of time testing that hypothesis, then everything can be thought of as a "ground up reductionist effort" built on those tiny proven hypotheses. Real world science, however, has never been so static. There are always ideas flittering about, not yet nailed down into a bottom-up structure of theories. Quite often these ideas arise by observing gestalt behavior. Once observing these things, science then does strive to reduce it, for it is far easier to develop a scientific experiment in accordance with the scientific method if you take a reductionist approach. However, they are very much dependent on these ideas that haven't been pinned down. They point the scientists where to go next. We may not see it much in physics, where atomic theory rules the day, but in biology there's myriad gestalt effects to consider. Over time, we try to reduce them, but there's no proof that all things can be reduced this way. Even in physics, Atomic Theory is taken as an axiom at most, and a guiding theory at least. Consciousness is one of those things. While science may try to apply reductionism to it, so far it has not succeeded. Thus, any science which studies consciousness must embrace some level of holism because they do not yet have the reductionist structure to build upon. Like all things, it's a balance. If science falls too far towards reductionism, it finds itself sluggish in responding to newly discovered gestalt patterns. If it falls too far towards holism, it finds it difficult to create repeatable and reproducible scientific experiments. 

The answer to your title question would be an unequivocal "yes." Its absolutely possible that some of our conceptions about the physical universe may be wrong. In fact, I believe that most scientists are rather confident that some of our conceptions are wrong. However, the goal of rectifying this issue may be out of scope of mere mortals. One famous phrasing of the issue is the MÃ¼nchhausen trilemma. It argues that all efforts to "prove" anything logically must end in one or more of the following: 

The search for extraterrestrial life is philosophical because there is not really consensus on what "life" means. Pinning a definition on "life" is a philosophical discussion going back thousands of years. However, if one assumes "life needs oxygen," and begins searching for exoplanets that show oxygen content in their atmosphere, that search is now scientific (even though part of the underlying reason for the science remains philosophical). As for whether someone has written on the implications, the answer is yes, but unfortunately its complicated to try to pin down specifically whom has written on it. Certainly science fiction authors have written on it, some of whom I would call philosophers in their own right. You could make the argument that Buddha wrote about it, given the appearance of Sanskrit words translated as "Sentient beings" in so many places. In a sense, the answer would weigh in on one of the older philosophical and religious questions out there: "Do we have meaning?" The answers to that question seem to often take different forms if we are unique in the universe and special than if life is common in the universe. 

I think the issue is a selection bias. Generally speaking, people spend most of their political effort dealing with difficult things. Accordingly, most situations of merit come in the form of tradeoffs, P&~Q or ~P&Q. Any situation where P&Q or ~P&~Q becomes the easy situation often does not warrant discussion... we just stop talking about it and do it! Solutions which lend themselves to P&Q also often lend themselves to being decomposed into merely P or ~P and Q or ~Q. Thus we rarely get to a point where discussing P&Q as a whole moves things forward. We do see a resurgence of P&Q in diplomacy. In diplomacy, there is a fine art to wording a treaty such that it serves as a win-win for both countries. 

Now, to follow the scientific method, he sets up a null hypothesis, H0, with the intent of rejecting it via statistics 

This is a great question. The challenge with this definition is that it is merely descriptive. It is a very useful definition in every day life for talking about science, but some questions are rather difficult to answer if one is using this definition: 

Philosophical arguments are made mathematical all the time. Its why you will see First Order Logic symbols thrown around on this Stack Exchange. I think the big difference between mathematics and philosophy is that mathematics tends to start from something like a formal system, and see how much can be proven within it. Philosophy approaches the question of "what formal systems are right?" If a formal system proves something non-intuitive, Philosophers will immediately start studying the axioms of the formal system to see if they may be missing something. Philosophers admit more shades of "color" into their arguments than mathematicians can. There are absolutely places where they blur. Consider the huge debate between ZF and ZFC in set theory. If you look at the wording choices, they are hard to distinguish from a philosophical debate. At the extreme, Proof theory and Model theory are almost more philosophical than mathematical. A read of the consequences of Tarski's definition of Truth is really almost entirely philosophy with only a pinch of Math for seasoning. Russel and Whitehead's "Principia Mathematica" could qualify as an attempt to make a religion out of pure math. On the other side, philosophical issues like Xeno's paradox were deemed "insufficiently explained" until Calculus turned his philosophical argument into a mathematical argument. Mathematical inconsistency is often used to refute a position by using the strict meanings of FOL symbols like "AND" and "OR." These are used to force philosophers to identify where their arguments diverge from the world of mathematics. Turing's mathematical work strongly influences modern philosophy, especially with the development of AIs continuing as it is. The real true difference is probably more linguistic than anything else. There is clearly a continuous gamut from pure philosophy to pure mathematics. However, we as humans tend to draw lines between terms because that makes them more meaningful. Mathematics tends to be colder than philosophy. Something is either formally proven, formally disproven, or an interesting outstanding problem. Philosophy is more open. Two philosophies may persist for centuries, not because nobody disproved one of the, but because people like both of them. I think Philosophy is more willing to accept mathematics. However, mathematics avoids associating with philosophy except under well controlled conditions (such as those needed to support the richness that explodes from Formal Systems). This could account for the asymmetry in terminology you see. Note: I say nothing about philosophers and mathematicians. The people in each group are as complicated as any person. I'm just talking about the topic described by the words. 

This is the most classic one, so it has the most classic answers. A compatabalist will state that an agent is free to choose from among the options which are physically possible. No compatabalist would claim that free-will involves the ability to break the shackles, grow wings, and fly away (unless you're in a Red Bull add). Likewise, no dualist would ever make a similar claim. In a shackles case, I would argue that the agent is smaller than "the entire body." The thing with agency would be a part of the mind which can choose to contract muscles or not. 

In your question you ask about a statement implying the "opposite" of itself, which isn't typically a well-defined wording, but in the comments you change to using "negation" which is a much more rigorously defined term, so I'll focus on that. You actually aren't looking so much for a statement as a system of inference. "Mainstream" logic would state that what you are looking for can never occur. In fact, Aristotle called this the "law of non-contradiction."
