If you have any links in your web app that are hard coded to port 85, obviously those will break. However, if it is well written using relative URLs, and where necessary using a config script to deal with the hostname:port part of the URL (which you can update), then you should be fine. If you are running in a development environment, you should change the port number in IIS and check to see what happens. If you are using a different port because you developed on the production server then your job will be a bit more difficult, with a higher risk of end users seeing issues. If they do, then you probably made a good case for a development environment for future development :-) 

Include details of both ends of the cable at both ends, since sometimes you want to know where the far end of the cable goes! I would say it is useful to use the physical labelling on the devices themselves, and then keep documentation of how that maps through in the specific system (e.g. NIC on a server may be labelled A, but in the OS it is eth0). Where you have multiple interface cards with multiple ports, you should agree and document a naming convention. If you use VLANs you might want to include VLAN ID, or you might want to use different colour cables for different things. I would avoid any tags that snag, and definitely anything that falls off easily. 

Hotmail is the same as Microsoft Live, so you could do this by setting up custom domains to accept mail via an additional domain, and then create an alias for me@myself.com. Mail sent to myself@hotmail.com or me@myself.com will end up in the same mailbox. DNS has no part in email redirection. MX records in DNS just specify which servers handle mail for a given domain. 

Like Christopher Cashell says you need to log the traffic to know what is required by all your systems. Given that your business may not accept a DENY rule that blocks all traffic while you figure out what is required, you could set a PERMIT rule instead, and log what is permitted, and analyse that. You can then use that to set up more specific PERMIT rules and then switch on the DENY as the last rule for that interface. That way you are only allowing the traffic you permitted. Microsoft documentation should give you the ports their systems need - but your going to have to hunt them down for each application you are using. 

Like Nick said, Nagios is your app. I'm pretty sure all the graphical monitoring systems draw inspiration from Nagios. Many of them simply put a GUI on top of Nagios configuration. But you are going to hate maintaining the multiple interdependent config files in Nagios. You'll definitely need some kind of version control to roll back when you make a mistake, and draw lots of diagrams to remind yourself what you did. Max Schubert et al's book Nagios 3 Enterprise Network Monitoring will be of great use if you go for this. But despite all the challenges Nagios rocks! 

If you see all those 250 OK messages and your message gets through to the test address, then the account is working fine. If you get an error, then it will indicate where the problem is in the config. If you get an error after the MAIL FROM: command, then the user is not allowed to send mail at all. If you get an error after the RCPT TO: command, then the user is not allowed to send mail to the test address. If you get an error after the body of the mail, or the message never arrived, then check your maillog file. It is pretty useful to have another window with a live view of your maillog - will allow you to see what is happening on your mailserver as it happens. Very helpful when tracking things down. You can also test by switching to the mailer user, and using the mail command to send a test message - view the maillog at the same time to see what happens. 

Normal router should work fine, as long as you are not expecting it to do the physical layer SDSL connection. Connection would be: SDSL Equipment -- Router -- LAN I only say this because it is so common to find combined ADSL modem, router, switch, firewall thought of as just an ADSL router. I have seen a router (ASA 5505) do the PPoE negotation which would normally be handled by the ADSL equipment, but the ADSL modem was still required. Aside - is "ADSL modem" the correct name for the bit that talks to the phone line? 

Simon Catlin is right. It's a drag though. If you can get away with just forwarding the messages to a group, that is easier than trying to set up notifications. Unfortunately for my question, I can't so we are paying someone to do the development for us... 

It seems a lot of people out there don't realise the important difference between IP protocols and TCP/UDP ports. The following packet captures focussed on the above types of traffic. These were set up on both the remote and HQ ASAs: 

Source was Cisco DSL Router Configuration and Troubleshooting Guide - Cisco DSL Router: PC Acting as a PPPoE Client which needed adjusting slightly for the 877. 

We do this with Barracuda Network's Web Filter, which can be integrated with Active Directory. You can also assign certain IP addresses specific permissions - it is easy enough to make sure the same computer always has the same IP address on your network via DHCP or plain old static configuration. We chose this because we liked the reporting it does, and we got a good deal. There are plenty of competing web filter solutions, hardware, software, open source, and even cloud based Software as a Service solutions, that integrate with Active Directory - if they do that then they almost 100% do what you need. 

I have a simple executable to run as a scheduled task on some Windows Server 2008 R2. The executable downloads a file from a couple of locations, then writes the time to download the files to a SQL database. The problem I am having is that when I run the EXE using my account, it works absolutely fine. When I run it as an account set up specially for use with this scheduled task the task fails. It manages to download the files ok, but fails when trying to write to the database. The user used to write to the database is hard coded within the EXE. My account is a Domain Admin, whereas the account to run the task as is not. I am trying to figure out which of the Security Settings in Group or Local Policy might be missing, or if their is something else. The EXE throws an error message: 

Enabling Jumbo Frames means allowing a larger Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), usually by setting the MTU to 9000. To verify this has worked you can use ping in windows with the -l flag to set the packet size, and the -f flag to set Don't Fragment flag in the packet. 

I have a small virtual private server running CentOS and www/mail/db, which has recently had a couple of incidents where the web server and ssh became unresponsive. Looking at the logs, I saw that oom-killer had killed these processes, possibly due to running out of memory and swap. Can anyone give me some pointers at how to diagnose what may have caused the most recent incident? Is it likely the first process killed? Where else should I be looking? 

I need to set up server side rules (auto-replies for users who have left etc), and having to login as each user and open Outlook is a serious PITA. Also any time that I have to create any rules for users that haven't left, I currently need to change their password, login as them, then somehow notify them of the new password and get them to change it again (tricky, since they cannot now login with the old password!) I can open those users' mailboxes when running Outlook, and access the mailboxes via Outlook Web Access. I also have admin access to the Exchange 2003 server. Is there anyother way of doing this that is more admin friendly? 

Set up your ISP router to do port forwarding for your database and version control ports to your PC. Get a static IP address or use DynamicDNS for your home internet connection, so you can tell your fellow students how to get to your PC. Secure the hell out of your personal PC because you have opened it up to the internet. 

Cisco suggest that this may be symptoms of an attack, but I don't think so. Protocol 50 is ESP, which is part of IPSec. The remote site is connected to HQ via IPSec VPN using Cisco ASA 5505 at the remote end and ASA 5510 at HQ. ICMP type=3, code=4 means Fragmentation Needed and Don't Fragment was Set. Setting Don't Fragment is normal for IPSec ESP packets. I think what is happening is that packets are leaving our ASA 5510 with the default MTU of 1500. When it hits the router with ip_address that router is unable to pass the traffic to the next hop that uses a smaller MTU, thus requiring fragmentation. The router is sending an ICMP packet back as DF is set, but our Firewall is blocking this, not because of an access rule, but because for some reason our ASA 5510 wasn't expecting this ICMP message. I am trying to figure out whether the problem is with the configuration on our HQ ASA 5510 (although we have another 36 sites all working fine), the remote ASA 5505 (which is configured uniformly with our other remote ASA 5505s) or something in between the two. What should I do next? Update As requested here are the ICMP lines from the HQ ASA 5510: 

The only way to establish this in fact would be for the ISP to confirm it. If you are providing a legitimate service to one of those schools, and have a good relationship with a sys admin at the school, then you could do worse than ask one of them to contact their ISP and check. Why would they be throttling your service? You could run your own Glasnost test server and have some someone at an affected site run tests, and compare against a site served by a different ISP. 

Since you mean that you only want your messages to a specific email address on a specific server to go straight through, you could send to info@55.66.77.88 and configure the mailserver to accept mail sent to its IP address and deliver to the correct mailbox. That would cut out the DNS lookup altogether. 

Where is your MX record stored? Presumably on a local DNS server, as domain3 isn't a public domain. In which case, check where your server is doing it's DNS lookups. If it is going straight to a public DNS server, then you will see this message. Assuming that domain3 is not just an example. 

I'm configuring a new ASA 5505 for deployment as a VPN endpoint in a remote office. After configuring it and connecting the VPN, I get the following messages: 

When you talk about keeping your costs down make sure you are considering the cost to yourself or your staff of maintaining an email server. As previously mentioned there is a very steep learning curve including getting the initial setup right and over the first year or two of running the server dealing with spam, user requests, handling outages, redundancy etc etc. Compared to hosting a webserver, a mail server is much more demanding on your time. As a very small service provider, I regret setting up an email server - it has been the biggest pain, and not rewarded me in line with the effort put in. Consider the options of outsourcing the email and passing on the cost to your customers (by which I mean whoever is paying you - which might be advertisers rather than end users). Or set up your system so that your users can use an existing mail account of their choice. Do any of your customers not already have an email address/service? Do any of your customers really need another one? Of course, maybe you really want to add the mail admin string to your bow, in which case go for it! If you opt for Postfix as your MTA, then The Book of Postfix is a worthwhile investment, and there is a pretty good website out there for asking questions when you encounter problems or don't understand something... Can't quite recall what it is right now :-) 

I am currently reorganising subnets in my organisation. New subnet is 10.65.0.0/24 and old subnet is 172.16.0.0/21. Clients in new subnet are not able to access a web application in 172.16.9.0/24 - they get prompted for credentials then a 401.2 error (traffic is routed but authentication fails). Clients in an old subnet (even the same clients moved to a different network location) are able to access without being presented with credential requests or any errors. The webapp runs in IIS6 - no changes have been made to the web app - the only thing (I am aware) that has changed is the network location of the clients. Update 1: I've simplified the test case down to eliminate any odd passthrough to SQL server etc. Now I'm just requesting a static text file from the server - I still get the 401.2 error. If I switch from Integrated authentication to Basic Authentication, then the page is delivered fine. Update 2: Looks like the apps affected are limited to using NTLM - apps that use Kerberos authentication seem to work fine. Update 3: The new subnet is currently routed to the subnet with the servers in it via a Cisco Meraki MX firewall - there aren't any firewall rules denying traffic but this does seem to be the major difference between the two subnets. Has anyone else come across this?
