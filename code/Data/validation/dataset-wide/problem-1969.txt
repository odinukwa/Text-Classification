As you have been advised by others. Don't sign The agency is in a bad spot and they think they can put the squeeze on you. Sounds like they are realizing how dependent they are on you and they don't even understand your work process. Give them the terms you require. You met with them the start of November and they declined. They are the one springing new terms last minute. Don't work without a written signed contract. They let the contract expire. 

IT security is very sensitive to convictions. You have access to data. Even a misdemeanor can nix you. A DWI can fail a background check. A raw programmer there will be limited opportunities. Stay away from the data. 

I think there is too much to the message you proposed in your answer It opens you up to debate Just close it out politely and concisely 

Just tell her you are on a schedule and need to get going. If naked makes you uncomfortable then fine. For many people showers or changing room is not a big deal. If you play sports a lot of banter takes place in the showers and changing (locker) room. 

I suggest you get more aggressive at the stand up and say you did not request any help. By saying he spent the whole day helping you makes you look bad. Management should not let him neglect tasks assigned to him. 

To some people power user means that you can replace components. If you can diagnose hardware problems and replace components then list that. If you are set on using the term then give it some meat. To me this is a power user. 

IANAL (I Am Not A Lawyer) Even for your boss I am not sure if this would rise to criminal charges. It is fraud but not sure it would rise to criminal charges under RICO Act. Still something you want to stay away from. This may be better on law.stackexchange.com. I get the proposal may not be legally binding. A person may not be available when the contract starts. But a forged signature is fraud. The agency might not file charges but they would likely never do business with the company again. Your boss is taking a foolish risk. That is close call as you are not making the representation. You are being asked to facilitate. The manager should just have done it them-self. You have to worry this is to use you as a scapegoat. If you do this for fear of losing your job then be sure you have it in writing you were instructed and stated your objection. They can state you altered email. To get a server subpoenaed is not cheap or easy. You could cc his/her boss but things could go poorly for you. I think refuse would be better than cc. That said when I worked as a consultant I know my name was used on many proposals that I was not ware of. But I had worked with them before in that capacity and they knew I was not tied up in a long term contract. For sure they did not forge my signature. 

You are massively employable. Either way you are going to start at a very good salary. You are going to have multiple job offers. And your skills are not going to fall out of demand. Go with what you want is of most interest to you. Grad course with implement on a team would better present you as a guy ready to hit the ground running. If the grad course is a renowned prof and you get to work with some really bright student then maybe go that route. If you might want to go into research then go into research then take the research option. I know this going to sound whacked but with video and audio content you could work with government intelligence if that is of interest to you. Go with your heart. At this point you don't need to worry about building a resume. 

You really need a slide rule to know what you did was wrong? Take the punishment and tell them you understand what you did was wrong. Don't even think about trying to justify your insubordination. They are probably not going to fire you but there will be some discipline. 

No, quality of life is much more relevant to employee lives. Better schools are going to have a higher cost of living and some people are going to accept that higher cost of living. Near a beach is going to have a higher cost of living and some people are going to accept that higher cost of living. A desolate area with no positive features may have a very low cost of living but you still may need to pay a premium to attract people. You need to base it on what it takes to attract talent to that location. Use local cost of living to compare what you are paying in different regions. When I got out of college in high demand degree with several offers my lowest offer was San Francisco and it had the highest cost of living. My best offer was from the city with the lowest cost of living. 

I think bring it up would cause more problems than it would solve. That is clearly their responsibility. I would highly recommend you not log in to fix anything even the most minor if you are not under contract. I know it sounds harsh but if you help them at all they will just continue to ask for help until you have to cut them off and they will be more mad than if you just cut them off at the first question. 

I don't take it as a bad move. His boss was with him on the trip. His boss wants to know there is a fix. You are considered the fix and it is 100% appropriate to get you in front of the boss boss. Yes saying the code was not perfect is a bit of a jab but I would not take it poorly. Our code is not perfect and client is going to be inspecting is a heads up. My perception is that if he felt you had a performance issue then he would (should) have had a performance discussion with you prior to the meeting. I suggest a proactive approach. Code review if you don't today. Try and make contact with customer code review team so you can address issues on a technical level. Review the release process and ask your boss if any changes should be make. Ask your boss if he would like to review code before it is release to the customer. 

A real problem is the person has an expectation of privacy. This person could be exchanging legitimate confidential information your boss is not supposed to see. I would get this checked off with security and HR. Maybe even legal. How you tell your boss that is tricky. If he orders you to perform the then get it in writing that you are doing it because were ordered and you have privacy concerns. If there are performance concerns HR should be involved. A more reasonable approach would be for HR or security to audit like 100 emails between him and specific colleges with approval from legal. Forward all future email is pretty extreme. It was edited the boss is the founder of the company and they have no IT security group. You are kind of stuck. If you refuse you could get fired. 

If you resign in 2 months versus 6 months it is not really much different on a resume. If you are convinced it is not going to get better soon enough to make a difference then start looking for another job. Be selective about the new job. It would still be worth bring up some (not all) process improvements and see how they are received. 

Not getting your logic on cannot interview. You can take a vacation day on PIP. Worse case is they let you go for taking a vacation day but you still get paid up till then and get to interview while you are (technically) employed. 

IANAL (I Am Not a Lawyer) Need to check your contract (employment agreement). You could be in voilation of your contract if you even approach the client about direct hire. Also the client may have a no poach clause in their contract with your employer. 

If he is your Friend on Facebook I don't see a problem. Just inform him you applied. Don't go into your experience or ask if he got your resume. "Heads up I mailed my resume to HR." 

She was assigned the job duty so they felt she would perform the task. Did she receive any special training? If she received no special training then it is probably best to leave it off. I was on emergency fire crew at a refinery and never fought a fire. I would have put that on my resume if I was looking for a job at the time. But I did receive training in fire fighting. 

They probably saw what they needed to see good or bad. If you waited more than 3 tables they got to see how you work. If it went poorly you most likely would have had some signs. Did they correct you in front of the customer or add to what you said? If they said "I will take the desert order" that is probably a bad sign. If they let you wait the tables beginning to end with no or little correction it probably went OK. If they had no intention of hiring you they probably would have told you. 

If you are going to have Google in performing the job then it seems reasonable to use Google for the assessment. But it should still be your own work. Don't copy solutions as a whole. If the assessment does not match your real skills it will eventually come out. If it lands you a job you are not qualified for you will be frustrated and possibly fired. Take it to an extreme. Does refer to the documentation count as cheating? If they want a controlled result then they should have timed tasks at their location with either no access to the Internet or limited (E.G. msdn.microsoft.com/en-us). This is just my opinion but I think is should be like 8 super easy questions if you miss you are out. And then 1 or 2 challenging questions in 2-4 hours. A two week take home to build a full web site to me is ridiculous - that is a company that has no idea how to measure core skills. I see tech questions that appear to be interview question and I will typically pass unless the question is interesting to me. If you are going to post for an answer on the stack exchange network then use a name that does not trace back to you. 

Machine learning is in demand right now so it is harder for them to find all the qualifications. Just answer the questions honestly. 

The problem you have is your boss may be asking for the right reasons which is plan for bringing in replacement(s). But if you say yes it could go into your personnel file and you could be flagged as a disgruntled employee / flight risk and possibly passed over for a promotion or raise. Worse case they fire you but that is pretty extreme and not likely. You actually pose two question. Looking and thinking. If you really are looking then you can: 

If you both get short listed then tell them. If you tell them earlier they may just eliminate you from consideration. If you wait for the offer they could feel like you were not respectful of their time. 

I don't even come close to believing these hourly people are complaining about time and a half on weekends. This is a (weakly veiled) cost cutting measure period. The opposite. Hourly manufacturing is going to complain about loss of hours and overtime. Mandatory "covering" for hourly is not common. If hourly was union this would not happen. This is not a good policy. It will piss off both hourly and salary employees. You did not get degree in engineering to work the floor on weekends. To me this is like asking you to stay after and mop floors for free. I worked as a engineer at an plant and if union went out on strike yes we covered. But we got 3x pay to cover. 

People put certifications and also sorts of stuff on a business card I don't see why not I would but it where certification are listed which is typically below you name 

It is for cancer awareness. You should talk to people at work and tell them you did it for cancer awareness. Be proactive as some people may fear you actually do have cancer. I think most people would view it as noble and not think any less of you professionally. If you do interview you should have a chance to explain why your hair is short. And again I think they would view it as noble. Another part is how you look with a shaved head. Demi Moore looks fine shaved. I did the opposite for no noble cause. Made a stupid bar bet that I would grown my hair to a man bun. It is a total pain and for sure I would cut it if I was looking for a job. In my job I never come in contact with customers.
