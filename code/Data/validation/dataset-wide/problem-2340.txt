What its size should be with respect to number of people who are going to use it? I've found that you can dig one cathole and use it multiple times,(by the same person or multiple people), just dig a deeper hole (deeper but not wider). After each use, toss down a thin layer of dirt to "hide" the waste from other creatures. If it is attracting flies, then you should use more dirt. Caution: Cordon the immediate area with a rope or tarp to prevent people or animals from stepping in the open hole. Be sure to completely fill in the hole before moving your campsite. How far should two toilet holes should be from each other? Doesn't matter. When one hole is nearly full, finish filling it with dirt, put a rock or boulder on it to mark the spot so you don't dig there again, and dig another hole 4 or 5 feet away to start over. If you want multiple holes at one time, then your biggest concern will probably be privacy. 

I usually don't carry any kind of stove with me when I go hunting - this could be anytime from September to November or in May and early June. The weather can vary wildly during these times and I've experienced every kind of weather, from 10 below (F) and snow, to 30 degrees and freezing rain, to 90 (F) and dry. I found that going without hot food for up to a week is not a big deal - for me. That said, I prefer hot meals so, outside of a hunting/backpacking trip, I put more effort into my meals. The pros of not cooking while backpacking: 

Last week, I backpacked into Idaho's White Cloud Mountains. I boiled a few eggs the night before and placed them in the refrigerator. On the morning we left, I took them out and rolled them up in a t-shirt and tucked them under a jacket in my pack. They were still very cold the next morning and cold enough on the second morning. Daytime temperatures were around 80 and it got down in the 40's at night. They spent the night with the other food about 12 feet off the ground. I'm sure that a small brick of frozen Blue Ice would've kept them cold for at least one more day. Sealing the food and ice in a bag, then wrapping your sleeping bag around it would probably work really well. 

This focuses more on attributes (habits) rather than equipment, since much of my study of history suggests that the possession (or lack) of equipment and/or supplies does not always determine success or failure on an expedition (so many explorers experienced equipment failure/loss). Instead, it is one's attributes and knowledge that contribute most to success - and this probably hasn't changed over the centuries. In Outdoor Survival Skills, author and survivor/explorer Larry Dean Olsen lists some of the attributes that survivors possess: 

My son raised meat rabbits for some time and he used method #2. It was quick, easy, and humane. If I found a wild rabbit that was fatally injured but was still alive, and I had no gun, I would use method #1. I think just picking up an already injured animal to use #2 would cause it unnecessary pain. 

The author states that it is known that Colter carried 30 pounds of equipment and supplies and, in addition, he carried an essential selection of trade goods that would have made his pack considerably heavier. Unfortunately, he does not specifically list the contents of Colter’s equipment and supplies. On an expedition in present-day Montana, John Colter was surprised and captured by over 800 Blackfeet Indians. After being captured and his partner killed, John Colter’s captors decided to make sport of him, stripping him naked and telling him to run over a plain pocked with prickly pear cactus. They gave him a short lead, then pursued. Colter outran the Indians and managed to completely evade them that night. 

The two most common types of tools used in hunting are firearms and bows. Hunters who just want to harvest meat often don't care which tool they use - to them, "One kill is one kill". They will often choose the easier tool to master, which is the firearm. Folks that want to follow long-held traditions (held by their own ancestors or by people they admire/respect) will choose one tool or the other, based on the tradition followed. As for managing game populations, both tools can be utilized to maximum benefit. Hunting with a rifle can be easier, provided the hunter has educated him/herself on the use of the weapon and has practiced enough to become proficient. Rifle seasons are typically short for this reason. Hunting with a bow and arrow, on the other hand, normally requires much more knowledge of the animals, much more practice with the tool (bow), and much more knowledge and practice in woodsmanship. The hunter must get much closer to his quarry. Wild animals are very wary and usually notice a nearby hunter first, even when he wears camouflage, and sneak away without ever being seen by the hunter. Thus, success rates in archery seasons are typically much lower than firearm seasons. Therefore, game departments, using both firearm and archery seasons as management tools, usually lengthen archery seasons. Also, to give archery hunters a little extra help in areas where extra harvest will not hurt game populations (and to help hunters put meat in their freezers), archery seasons are often scheduled to coincide with the target animal's rut (breeding season), when the male animal is less wary. As far as safety goes, many, if not all, jurisdictions require the hunter to graduate a hunter safety class BEFORE hunting, and/or participate in a mentoring program. Many, but not all, require the hunter to wear "hunter" orange during firearm seasons. Where I live (Idaho), the safety class is required for all hunters (except first-timers that hunt with a mentor), and bowhunters may hunt during "any weapon" season, which is the only season you can hunt with a rifle, and are not required to wear orange. 

I think this is a very good list to start with, before even considering equipment, which can vary tremendously. Equipment is unimportant when compared to your own personal attributes and knowledge. If one does not possess most of the above attributes, then he/she should keep his outdoor travel somewhat close to civilization (physically or via communication) in case of emergency. This person would also need to rely heavily on modern equipment. Mr. Olsen tells a true story of Zeke Sanchez who was dropped off “from a small boat onto a bleak stretch of the shore of Lake Powell in southern Utah.” Zeke set off with no gear or supplies (so he could travel fast), to catch up with an outdoor survival group that was 3 days ahead of him, 

Even when I backpack without typical cooking gear, I'm still prepared to make an emergency meal in case my body temperature gets too low or I simply want or need something hot. For this, I carry a stainless steel cup and a couple packets of tea and a small ziploc or two of quick oats and sugar (don't forget a spoon!). Of course, if and when I use these, a fire is then required. Just as a side note here, since you mentioned "non-winter conditions": if you intend on backpacking in the Rocky Mountains, be prepared for cold weather at any time of the year. On July 27, this year, here in eastern Idaho, we had a couple inches of hail in the lower areas and snow in the mountains. Two days later, although the weather was beautiful and in the 70's, I found 4 inches of snow still covering the trail, in places, on a section of the Continental Divide Trail. It's never really "non-winter" in the Rockies. 

Place a straight stick (broom or shovel handle is perfect) across the back of the rabbits neck and stand on the ends of the stick. Then grasp the back legs and stand up, pulling the back legs straight up. This separates the spine at the base of the skull. Quick and painless. Hold the rabbit's back feet firmly in one hand, causing its body to hang straight down, and hit it on the back of the head with a heavy club. Instant death. You want blood to begin pouring out of the mouth; otherwise it's only knocked out.
