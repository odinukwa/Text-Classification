Hugo Winckler's 1907 History of Babylon and Assyria, says something along these lines: Semitic people originated in the Arabian Peninsula. All Semitic migrations were caused by overpopulation. Syria was the only place for them to migrate to, so they always appeared here. This included Kish, Amorites, and Aramaeans. He also describes a "last phase" of migrations, continuing from the 7th century B.C. to Islam. How wrong was he? Could all these people have come from Arabia? 

The Medes Kingdom left a mark on Greek mythology. The Persian Empire, though, should not be equated with Zoroastrianism. It was an eastern religion, not even in Chaldea (Assyria and Babylon) It only took hold in Armenia and the Transcaucasus. If the Zoroastrians did influence Greeks, it probably would have been in the time of Xerxes. The father of Democritus is said to have hosted Xerxes before Thermopylae. When Democritus used his inheritance money to travel east, he interacted with an elusive character named Ostanes. Ostanes is only recorded in Greek tradition, and later in Arabic tradition. He is not in any Persian sources. They say that he was a son of Darius I. He may have actually been the chief Magi at the time. He comes down as a later "Magician" in Greek sources, along with Hystaspes and Zoroaster. Hellenistic era writers used these pen names for various treatises on Astronomy and "magic". Pliny says that Ostanes invented "Magic", and taught it to all of the philosophers: Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, Plato. While this is unlikely, you do have to wonder how the word magic came about. I wasn't going to answer this question, but I just happened to come across this stuff exactly when you asked it. Quite funny, given how unusual it is. 

The debate between Frawley and Witzel over the use of the word Samudra does not led to a clear-cut "victory" for the latter. Witzel has been known to make mistakes and even play politics. He also starts from the "Aryans originate in Central Asia" premise and proceeds to get the (mainly linguistic) evidence for it. The Harappans of the Indus Valley have left profuse archaeological records over a vast region - from the borders of Iran and beyond Afghanistan to eastern UP and Tapti valley, and must have supported over 30 million people and believed to be living an advanced civilization. And yet these people have left absolutely no literary records. The Vedic Aryans and their successors on the other hand have left us a literature that is probably the largest and most profound in the world. But according to the AIT there is absolutely no archaeological record that they ever existed. Either on the Indian soil or outside its boundaries. So we have concrete history and archeology of a vast civilization of 'Dravidians' lasting thousands of years that left no literature, and a huge literature by the Vedic Aryans who left no history and no archaeological records. The situation gets more absurd when we consider that there is profuse archaeological and literary records indicating a substantial movement of Indian Aryans out of India into Iran and West Asia around 2000 BC. This is the paradox. Other scholars like Shrikant Talageri have worked for a long time on the Indo-European homeland problem, analysed the Rig Veda and The Avesta to conclude that "India is likely to be the PIE homeland". Then there is the history of the Lost river of Saraswathi].This thesis states that the river Saraswathi dried up around 1900 BCE. The Rig Veda predates the Indus (or Sindhu-Saraswathi) civilization, as per N. Kazanas. Razib khan has a good genetic analysis of South Asians. It shows that Ancient South Indians and Ancient North Indians were "mixed up" long before 1500 BCE. Koenraad Elst also refutes the AIT in detail. A comprehensive and brief argument against the AIT was given by Rajeev Chandran a long time ago, but it is not widely disseminated. 

Nomadic warfare constantly changed civilization. The Amorites, Aramaeans, Persians, Sarmatians, Goths*, Arabs, Hungarians, and Islamic Turks had a large impact on society before the Mongols. Nomads made Assyria, Han China, Rome, and Persia fall. Nomads had dominated the known world before. What the Mongols did is they dominated the Silk Road. When civilizations built roads for commercial and military purposes, they provided a way for the nomadic people to infiltrate. By 1200 A.D. there was more infrastructure and interconnectedness that had been built on the revenues of the Silk Road. The Silk Road had brought unprecedented wealth to the Central Asian states. The Mongolian conquest was the culmination of 1000 years of centripetal forces acting on the Silk Road, which was centered on these Iranian Oasis states. The first major step towards centralization was the Turkic and Islamic Empires. The Turkic Empire disintegrated, but the steppe remained Turkicized. I can’t describe all the events here, but the other important people were the Samanids, Seljuks, Qara Khanids, Qara Khitai, and Khitan Mongols. There were also centripetal forces on the Russian steppes that took place mostly under the Cuman/ Kipchack confederation. These events created larger entities that were ripe for takeover by the Mongols. It was also 1200 A.D.; political and military technologies were more advanced. Around 1000 A.D. these conflicts became intensified and constant, and the Silk Road slowed to a trickle. Central Asia suffered economically and this facilitated the Mongolian conquests. Christendom was also eager to have someone pressuring the Turks from the East, and reached out to them on friendly terms. The Mongols were a robust people, and the Mongolian bow was the best weapon of its day. Mongolia was a warlike place and the process of selection was intense. They were the best people for the job, but this did not guarantee their success. Having the last word in the struggle between Arabs, Iranians, and Turks in Central Asia was the key factor.** From this point, with advanced Iranian bureaucracies, they expanded outward to conquer the Silk Road. It was the culmination of Silk Road history; the element which had unified all of Asia. Before this time, there was not the infrastructure connecting all of Asia. There is an old saying; “where goods can travel, so can soldiers”. It took a millennium for these centripetal forces to play out. *Goths adopted the lifestyle of the steppe when they conquered the Sarmatians. **You mentioned the unification of the steppe as a reason. They didn’t complete this until 1241, and it was never fully under their control. 

@Alex, while generally correct, presents a rather simplistic point of view. A doctrine of democratic centralism was indeed a cornerstone of power distribution in USSR. The important nuance is that to subordinate powers, according to the doctrine, the controlling organ must've appear united. That certainly gave the impression of dictatorship. In reality, far from it. Podgorny's removal illustrates very well that the Secretary General didn't consolidate enough power yet. As a side note, in a classic Brezhnev's Politburo an influence of people like Suslov, Grishin, Ustinov was comparable to Brezhnev's. As for "ordinary power", it was also a bit more convoluted. A Director of an enterprise (akin to CEO), an University Rector (akin to President), etc, was appointed by a supervising organization (everything had a supervising organization), and was subject to approval by a corresponding Party organ. For example, a Director reporting to an USSR Minister had to be approved by Central Committee. There was exceptions: Directors of some extremely important Institutes were appointed directly by Politbureau. 

TL;DR: Russia was not interested. Fort Ross did only sea otter hunting; all attempts to grow food on any reasonable scale failed. California in general was a desert with half-wild grazing and no arable land, except maybe some of New Helvetia (which started wheat production only as late as 1840, and even that was barely sustainable). Of course lumber was great, but I doubt Russia has any interest in more lumber. Mexico was equally uninterested. When in 1836 von Wrangel talked to Mexican government about legitimization of Fort Ross, they agree on the only condition that Russia would establish diplomatic relationship with Mexico. Tzar Nicolas said that he'd never recognize this ungodly Republic. So much for the either side interest. I don't even want to start on the ghastly logistics of a military expedition to California. PS: Russia had a small window of opportunity to expand into Oregon Territory before 1805, but Paul was preoccupied with the Maltese knighthood. 

Norsemen traded with the Thule of the Arctic region, whom they called Scraelings. The Thule (Proto-Inuits) arrived in the northeast Atlantic zone not long after the Norse settled in Greenland. There was a paleolithic, pre-Thule population in the Atlantic region, called the Dorset culture. They were annihilated by the Thule. The Thule also prevented the Norse from permanently settling any further West than eastern Greenland. Ultimately, they drove the norse entirely out of Greenland, so there were no Norsemen in the Americas. (Greenland is considered to be North America.) This left the Thule as the sold inhabitants of the Arctic zone. The Thule came from the Bering Strait. The region was connected with Asian trade, and utilized iron. There was a lot of competition and warfare based around hunting grounds for the bow-headed whale. They had Mongolian bows and Chinese style slat armor, which they made from bone. This made them militarily superior to the Norse. Recent research suggests that Thule migrated from the Bering Strait to the Atlantic because Genghis Khan disrupted the iron trade from Asia. Searching for new sources, they crossed to the continent with dog sleds in under 5 years. Norsemen couldn't have taken Thule women as they pleased. I think that such interaction would probably have been in the form of kidnapping or trade, so the natives would be assimilated into the Norse. If they did have sexual interactions with the Dorset people, it wouldn't have mattered because they were decimated. There were other types of natives in Newfoundland and Labrador, and a few Norsemen reached here. Given the paucity of Norse archaeological sites, or archaeological evidence thereof, its hard to imagine any significant interactions with anyone outside of Greenland. 

There is no archaeological attestation of aryan invasion/migration in spite of more than a hundred years of archaeological effort. There is no traditional memory or mention of aryan invasion/migration/intrusion in any of all the diverse historical traditions of India. There is no genetic trace of foreigners to attest to such a historical mixing. If at all Indian genotypes not only closer to each other but substantially more diverse and much older than European or middle eastern genotypes – therefore suggesting a reverse migration. After Africa the most ancient and diverse population happens to be that of India. In essence most other non-African people descended from prehistoric Indians. Philology is a tool of uncertain provenance and its conclusions are highly debatable. Aryan invasion/migration are hypothesis emerging basically from philology – hence open to debate. Development of historical theories on ancient India through more accurate means (archaeology & traditional history) rather than philology points to the indegenity and antiquity of Indians. Self references in many ancient Indian texts points to indegenity of Indians in a time-scale far older than those proposed by Aryan Invasion theory. In ancient Indian texts Arya means ‘noble of conduct and character’ rather than a race. If the oldest texts negate Aryan being a race – the idea of Aryan being a race of people can be traced to the rise of British imperialism and German nationalism – both historically discredited and defunct ideologies. Geology (mapping of the old Saraswati), archeo-metallurgy (iron working in ancient india), archeo-agriculture (maize, rice farming) etc points to a far greater antiquity of ancient Indians (which does not agree with Aryan Invasion Theory). Archeo-astronomy, archeo-mathematics, hydronomy (river names) seem to corraborate ancient indian texts on thier antiquity and claims of indigenity. Study of ancient Indian history has been held hostage to various extraneous constraints notably – euro-centricism, communism, various kinds of religious and regional chauvinism, and hence must be discarded. 

I made a note about something, but now I can't find it. It was a major shift in the political situation of Europe in the late Middle Ages. Initially one country was the hegemon and the pope organized all of the others against it. Then another country became hegemon, and all of the powers were organized against that one. I think it was Germany, and then France, but I'm not sure when. It was sometime from 1250-1450. I could be confusing it for something much later, but I don't think so. Update: I suspect it may have had to do with the lowland countries, aka Holland, Belgium and Flanders. Western powers were allied against one country to prevent it from gaining control of it, and then against another country. 

Before 450, Denmark was inhabited by the Saxons, Angles, and Jutes (from south to north). Geographically, the Jutes especially were the predecessors of the Danes. In the migration period, these three tribes left for Britain. Rome had abandoned Britain due to deteriorating conditions, which created a power vacuum. The Angles settled in Northeast Britain, the Jutes in southeast, and the Saxons in central and south Britain. The Jutes by far fared the best. Their territory became Kent, absorbed other Saxon kingdoms, married with the Merovingians. They became the first Bretwaldas. It's also notable that the Saxons may have been invited to Britain as mercenaries. After this migration period, we hear about the Danes in "Juteland". They were a distinct group of Norse who were related to the Swedes. They were especially freedom loving, hostile, and made up a large part of the Vikings. They were also some of the last of the Norsemen to convert to Christianity. Before the Saxons migrated to England, they tried to settle in Gaul*. They were repelled by the Franks, who were allies of Rome. They managed to stay in Angers until being defeated by Chilperic in 469 (Haywood 86-7). The settlement of the Visigoths by Romans may have been in part against Saxons (Haywood, 88). In the 600s, Germanic Frisians took Dorestad on the lower Rhine. This probably contributed to the decline of the Merovingians (Haywood, 126). When the Frisii were kicked out of Dorestad, they took up pirating. Germanic pirates acted like their Viking sucessors. This included occupying an island at the mouth of a major river, which was an ideal base for piracy. The new Germanic migrants had become a part of the sea. The sea was safer than mainland Europe. Just because Scandinavia was outside the reach of Roman Christianity (until Charlemagne), doesn't mean it was a wilderness. The Baltic Sea represented its own political sphere, like the Mediterranean. If it was really a wilderness, powerful war like tribes would not have emanated from it at regular intervals. The amber road had been active for Millennia, as well as numerous trade routes across Europe. Still, people tend not to migrate unless they are under pressure. Swedes did not directly follow the path of their German predecessors because from around 200 A.D., Germans had been developing sea power. They did try to make inroads into Europe, but were blocked by Franks and Goths. Still, the Frisii and Saxons had continental territories until Charlemagne. The first Swedish kingdom also formed around 750. This was also around the time that the Rus became a major force on the Dneiper river. These first Swedish kings were also the first kings of Norway c. 900. From about 750-1000, Scandinavia was full of tribal warfare and fledgling kingdoms. It just so happens that that 750 is about the time that Vikings appear in Western Europe. I haven't seen it mentioned, but it appears that the settlers were an effect of the state building of Scandinavia, 750-900. The inherent independence of the Baltic trade is later evidenced by the Hanseatic League. *I'm pretty sure this is in Haywood. I don't have it in front of me, and its not in my notes. 

Russian Wiki gives the following breakdown: According to an Austrian military archive, upon mobilization in August 14, the Austrian forces consisted of 68.4 divisions. Of them 53.5 divisions (78.1%) headed to the Russian front, 15 divisions (21.9%) to the Serbian. In February 1915 there was 63.5 divisions, of which 51 (80.35) fought against Russians, 8.5 (13.4%) agains Serbians, and 4 divisions (6.3%) stayed at the Italian border. Upon Italy entering the war, Austria concentrated against it 21 divisions (30.7%), while on Russian front there remained 39.5 (57.7%). On Serbian front there was 8 divisions (11.6%). By February 1916 the contigent dropped sharply at Balkans to 4.9%, and somewhat rose at Russian and Italian fronts (59.2% and 35.9% correspondingly). Half a year later at Russsian front there were 45 divisions (58.6%), and 29.75 (38.9%) at Italian. At Balcans there were just 2 divisions (2.6%). By February 1917 Austria had 82.25 divisions, of which 59.6% were at the Russian front. ... During the Russian's summer offense of 1917 there were 53.8 Austrian divisions (60.3%). At that time at the Italian front there were 32.75 divisions (36.9%), at Balkans - 2.5 divisions (2.8%). At the truce of Brest there was 43.5 divisions against Russia and 41.25 at Italian front. 15.25 Austrian divisions participated in occupation of Russian territories, while the bulk of the forces (73.8%) were at Italy. 2 divisions remained at Balkans, and 2 more were sent to France. 

Arthur Zuckerman wrote a book prosposing that there was an independent Jewish Kingdom in Medieval France. When Pepin the short campaigned against the Moors, the city of Narbonne offered resistance to him. The siege lasted for years and finally he sent them offers. They would only agree to having their own prince. There was a large Jewish population in the city and they send for a legitimate leader, the Exilarch himself or a descendant of David. Makhir, the Nasi or Prince, may have been the Exilarch. A lot of the history is recreated from Carolingian records. He also claims from epics that Makhir married Charlemagne's aunt, Adla. The kingdom lasted for about as long as the Carolingians did, and served an important defensive role in the south. What we definitely know, is that there was a renowned academy which Makhir started at Narbonne. The Jews had thriving communities at Narbonne and Toulouse and had a great deal of autonomy. Officially, it is just considered to be a Visigothic subject of Charlemagne. If you want to know what my answer should have looked like, read this: Jewish King of Narbonne 

I recall reading about a medieval Holy Roman Emperor, or heir apparent, that didn't get to rule over the kingdom. He was the last in line from a major dynasty, and held a high amount of prestige. He travelled around, undertaking various adventures and battles, especially in the east. He was a popular figure because of his exploits. Whatever the condition of Germany was at the time, he didn't get to have a typical rule. I think it was in the 15th century, possibly during the Hussite Crusades. It sounds obscure but he was actually the emperor, or was quite legendary.
