Note that efficient is sometimes defined in terms of the rank of the Schur multiplier. So be careful that your usage may contradict some of the papers (which give "efficient" presentations for groups with non-trivial Schur multiplier; they are allowed to use one extra relation per independent generator of the Schur multiplier). A related concept is an asymptotic version that seeks to describe how complicated presentations of finite simple groups get. In fact it seems they are very, very simple: 

If you prefer the Coxeter generators they are: $$ (1,2) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, (2,3) = \begin{pmatrix} e & 1 \\ 1 & e \end{pmatrix}, (3,4) = \begin{pmatrix} 1+e & 0 \\ 1 & 1+e \end{pmatrix} $$ (There are also sparser representations: $$ (1,2) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, (2,3) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, (3,4) = \begin{pmatrix} 1+e & 0 \\ 1 & 1+e \end{pmatrix} $$ that might also be useful.) I think this sort of thing should only have limited utility. S4/K4 = SL(2,2) is a pretty special situation. I would be more surprised if PSL(2,7) could be embedded in a SL(2,R). 

For those who are interested I give here a slightly more detailed version of Michael's answer. First note that $T\pi|_{HP} \colon HP \to TB$ is a vector bundle map covering $\pi \colon P \to B$ and a vector space isomorphism on each fiber. This is clear because $T_v\pi$ is obviously onto for every $v \in HP$ and because of dimensional reasons also injective. Then we can apply Ch. II. 2.26 Prop. XVI from Greub, Halperin, Vanstone: "Connections Curvature and Cohomology Volume I" and get immediately that the map $$ \alpha \colon C^\infty(P) \otimes_{C^\infty(B)} \Gamma^\infty(TB) \to \Gamma^\infty(HP), f \otimes X \mapsto f \cdot (T\pi|_{HP})^* X $$ is an isomorphism of $C^\infty(P)$-modules. Now by the very definition of $(T\pi|_{HP})^*$ and of the horizontal lift, the equation $$ ((T\pi|_{HP})^*X)(p) = T\pi|_{H_vP}^{-1}(X(\pi(p)) = X^h(p) $$ holds for every $p \in P$ and $X \in \Gamma^\infty(TB)$, i.e. $$(T\pi|_{HP})^* X = X^h$$ for every $X \in \Gamma^\infty(TB)$. Consequently given a $\sigma \in \Gamma^\infty(HP)$ there is a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and for every $i \in \{1,\dots,k\}$ $f^i \in C^\infty(P)$ and $X_i \in \Gamma^\infty(TB)$ with $$\sigma = \alpha\left(\sum_{i = 1}^k f^i \otimes X_i\right) = \sum_{i = 1}^k f^i X_i^h.$$ This proves the theorem. So the only nontrivial part is the proposition from Greub et. al. Just for convenience let my cite it here: Let $\hat \pi \colon \hat E \to \hat M$ and $\pi \colon E \to M$ be two vector bundles and let $\Phi \colon \hat E \to E$ a vector bundle map over some smooth map $\phi \colon \hat M \to M$ restricting to linear isomorphisms in the fibers. Make $C^\infty(\hat M)$ into an $C^\infty(M)$-module by setting $$ f \cdot \hat f := \phi^*f \cdot \hat f $$ for all $f \in C^\infty(M)$ and $\hat f \in C^\infty(\hat M)$. Then the map $$ \alpha_{\Phi} \colon C^\infty(\hat M) \otimes_{C^\infty(M)} \Gamma^\infty(E) \to \Gamma^\infty(\hat E), \hat f \otimes \sigma \mapsto \hat f \cdot \Phi^* \sigma $$ is an isomorphism of $C^\infty(\hat M)$-modules. Therby for $\sigma \in \Gamma^\infty(E)$ the smooth section $\Phi^* \sigma \in \Gamma^\infty(\hat E)$ is the pullback of $\sigma$, defined by $(\Phi^*\sigma)(\hat p) := \Phi|_{{\hat E}{\hat p}}^{-1}(\sigma(\hat p))$ for all $\hat p \in \hat M$. That's essentially the same theorem as Michael stated. Greub et. al. proof it by using that the modules of sections of a vector bundle is finitely generated (Serre-Swan) and that every vector bundle can enlarged via whitney sum to a trivial vector bundle. Again to prove this they also use Serre-Swan. 

I don't know of a resource with such a list, though you could easily make one with programs such as GAP or Magma. Since it is reasonably easy and interesting to analyze this problem, I'll outline how I suggest thinking about the examples: Let ⟨a⟩ act on the normal subgroup ⟨b⟩ in the semi-direct product ⟨a,b⟩. Then z = aibj is in the center of ⟨a,b⟩ if and only if it commutes with both a and b. Just writing it out you get a⋅(aibj) = ai+1bj and (aibj)⋅a = ai+1(bj)a, so bj has to be centralized by a. Similarly to commute with b, b has to be centralized by ai. You could try to use this in two directions: make ⟨a⟩ centralize part of ⟨b⟩, or let the kernel of the action of ⟨a⟩ on ⟨b⟩ be non-trivial (and proper). The first direction runs into some trouble, but does let you produce pretty obvious examples. As a concrete family, consider: 

Ivy does not appear to be a common term in mathscinet. Integrable vector Young functions are called IVY-functions in MR2055989 and related papers. Otherwise all occurrences are the plant or a person. 

then G -> S is quasi-affine. Question: Is the above statement true if (2) is weakened to require that the number of connected components over a fiber s \in S be prime the characteristic of the residue field k(s)? Of course, one would really like to know if the statement is true if G->S is not necessarily flat so that one could apply it to the inertia stack. On a related note, Raynaud also provides an example in VII3 of a smooth quasi-affine group scheme G -> A^2 over a field k with connected fibers but which is not affine. The classifying stack BG gives an example of stack with affine and connected stabilizers but with non-affine inertia stack. In the example of a scheme with non-affine diagonal, the inertia is of course affine. It's also easy to provide examples of non-affine group schemes with affine but non-connected fibers (eg. the group scheme obtained by removing the non-identity element over the origin from Z/2Z -> A^2). 

Yes, I believe the quotient of a reductive group scheme is reductive. Perhaps it's possible to show directly as Anton was suggesting. I have an argument that shows that if G is geometrically reductive then G/H is geometrically reductive. The statement that G reductive implies G/H reductive follows from Haboush's theorem (ie. G is reductive if and only if G is geometrically reductive). 

Is it possible to describe the Higgs mechanism from a deformation quantization point of view? How would one do it? Are there aspects of the Higgs mechanism and Higgs particle which one may see clearer from such a point of view? 

I am am currently studying Newtonian mechanics from a conceptional and axiomatic point of view. Now, if I am not mistaken, one (but surely not all) statement of Newtons second law about nature is, that (almost ?) every motion of a "classical particle" (or "small body") can be described by a second order differential equation on $\mathbb{R}^3$ (or $\mathbb{R}^{3n}$ if one considers a system of $n$ particles). That is, if $I \ni t \mapsto x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{3n}$ is a motion of $n$ particles in some environment, there is a smooth function $f \colon \mathbb{R}^{3n} \times \mathbb{R}^{3n} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^{3n}$ (which describes the influence of the environment) such that $\ddot x(t) = f(x(t),\dot x(t), t)$ for all $t \in I$, thereby $I$ is an interval and $\dot x$ denotes the derivative of $x$. Now my question is, if there is a good, mathematical sound intuition, which kinds motions are not allowed by Newtons second law because of the fact that it is a second order differential equation. In other words: I want to analyze in detail, what Newtons seconds law tells us about nature. Especially I want to grasp, how the condition to be a second order differential equation gives restrictions to possible conceivable motions of particles. What would be allowed additionally if the equations were of $3$. or higher order? 

Here is an example: In X13 of "Faisceaux amples sur les schemas en groupes", Raynaud provides an example of a group scheme G -> S in chacteristic 2 where 

Yep, a quasi-compact morphism of schemes (resp. locally noetherian schemes) is universally closed if and only the existence part of the valuative criterion holds for complete valuation rings (resp. complete DVRs) with algebraically closed residue field. This is in EGA (see II.7.3.8 and the remark II.7.3.9). Note that the separated hypothesis is not necessary there; for the valuative criterion of properness one needs to require that the morphism is quasi-separated. This holds more generally for Artin stacks if one allows a field extension of the fraction field of the valuation ring (see LMB 7.3). 

If X is a quasi-separated algebraic space and Spec k -> X is an etale presentation, then X is isomorphic to Spec k' for a field k'. (This is also true if X is Zariski locally quasi-separated.) The examples of algebraic spaces I know where this fails have diagonals that are not immersions. Is this also true for weakly locally separated algebraic spaces? An algebraic space is locally weakly separated if the diagonal is an immersion (not necessarily quasi-compact). In the literature, the term locally separated seems to have been reserved for quasi-compact immersions. (This question is asked by Johan in the stacks project (currently Remark 32.4.8))
