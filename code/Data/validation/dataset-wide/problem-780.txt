We have been calling the star by looking at which we can make out the direction of the North Pole the North Star. This was the only method at the disposal of the sailors during the days when they did not have any compass with them. When the axis of the earth would point toward Denab, Denab would become the North Star. When it would point toward Vega, Vega would become the North Star. Likewise, when the axis would point toward Thuban, Thuban would become the North Star. When we look at the Polaris from the earth, the Big Bear appears to be revolving around it. So I am curious to know which constellations would appear to be revolving around the Denab, Vega and Thuban when the axis of the earth would be pointing toward them due to wobbling of the earth. 

If cosmological inflation occurred at speeds less than $c$, wouldn't we see the CMB right in front of our noses (or not at all) instead of at 13.7 billion light years? And if it happened faster than $c$, does that mean inflation occurred before the current laws of physics (read the four basic forces) precipitated, was $c$ greater then than it is now? 

Newly born stars often have bilateral jets of gas ejected from them at high speeds (hundreds of km per seconds), often ending in Herbig-Haro objects. As I understand it those jets would have something to do with the star's magnetic field. How does this work? How can a magnetic field cause the high-energy ejection of matter? 

A note: don't talk about inflation for the current expansion. Inflation is the brief period immediately after the BB when the universe expanded at an outlandish rate. Matter was formed when the universe was so compact that its temperature was billions and even trillions of Kelvin hot. The energy of the vacuum in any given volume was so high that matter-antimatter pairs were created, which usually quickly annihilated. Sometimes, however those short-lived particles collided, releasing large amounts of energy. For instance, to create an electron you need an energy of 0.5 MeV. The graph below shows that at a temperature of $10^{16}$ K collision energy could be as high as 1 TeV. Because of its expansion the universe has cooled so much that its temperature is less than 3 K, which isn't nearly enough to create any new particles. 

Nobody has been able to find an answer how anybody may be able to see the inner organs of the human body as Natalya Demkina is able to see. In this context, I want to mention that the same way as we are able to see things in the light of an electric lamp or the sun-rays even though our eyes don't emit the visible band of the electromagnetic rays may it not be possible for her to see the inner organs of other people because the sun-rays contain X-rays also. According to me, it is wrong to say that since human eyes can't emit X-rays she may not be able to see the inner organs of other persons the same way as we are able to see everything even though our eyes don't emit the visible band of the electromagnetic waves. I want to know whether it may be possible that her brain's circuitry may be allowing her to see the inner organs through the X-ray band of the sun-rays unlike the rest of us or not. The chances of her having some special brain-circuitry of this type can't be ruled out according to me. 

Planes traveling east, for instance from the US west coast to the east coast, or from America to Europe, take advantage of this jet stream to save fuel. Note that the jet stream isn't anywhere as fast as the earth's rotation. At 50 degrees north the earth's rotation is about 1000 km/h, while the jet stream is about 200 km/h. 

"before" is not the right word. It suggests that there was an arrow of time which allowed to trace events. But time was created only with the big bang, there was no before. We don't know where the matter came from, or what caused the Big Bang. One hypothesis suggests that it was caused by the collision of branes in other universes, but there's no way to verify this, so in a strict sense it isn't science. Many researchers think we'll never have an answer this. 

If we have 13 months a year and 13 Zodiac Signs instead of 12 months and 13 Zodiac signs instead of 12 signs as suggested by me and have "28-day months" we would be benefited yet in one more way. We shall have precisely 4 weeks per month because 7 x 4 = 28. However, it would make for only 364 days in a year. So we would have to cover this flaw by redefining the year as a period of "13 months and a leap-day" for each non-leap year and two leap-days for each leap-year. in addition, if we may commence the 13 months-calendar from 22nd December instead of 1st January all Zodiac spells would begin on the 1st of each month and would end at the end of each month. So my suggestion merits consideration according to me. 

edit Enter relativity. So we say the light from Proxima Centauri has been underway for 4.2 years, but only from our point of view. As objects go nearer the speed of light their time slows down, and ultimately when you would reach light speed time would stop completely. Now photons travel at the speed of light, so for them time is at a standstill. From the photon's point of view it travels the whole distance from Proxima Centauri to Earth instantaneously: it arrives at Earth at the same time it leaves Proxima Centauri! (You can't do this with objects which have mass.) 

The universe is thought to be flat: $\Omega = 1 \pm 1\%$. As I understand it we can determine this by measuring triangles against the CMB. Yet during inflation dark energy made the universe grew much larger than the radiation universe, of which the CMB is the limit. Isn't it possible then that at the "smaller" scale of our visible universe it appears flat, but at the universe's full size it's curved? A bit like a square of 1 meter sides on the surface of the earth also looks flat, while at larger scale the earth is curved. What are the chances that the 1% uncertainty could lead us to a universe with $\Omega \ne 1$? 

According to me following reason of mass accumulation of earth has been completely overlooked so far. The sunrays that fall on the oceans travel deep into water and finally get converted into mass which eventually results in "mass-accretion of the earth". So earth is continuously getting heavier due to the mass being added to it due to this reason year by year. Therefore, should this also not be one of the reasons why the orbit-time of the earth (time taken by it to take one round of the sun) is bound to change (increase or decrease) with time? 

If we convert the mass of all the stars and all the planets which must be weighing trillions and trillions of tonnes by the equation E = m.c^2 it gets converted into an unimaginable amount of energy. Would so much of energy not have gone into the evolution of the Universe? I am at a great suspense whether the Big Bang theory or any other theory at all answers from where so much of energy would have come that would have got converted into so many trillions and trillions of tonnes of the mass of all the galaxies put together. How we can believe in the big-bang-theory unless we know from where so much of energy would have arrived?
