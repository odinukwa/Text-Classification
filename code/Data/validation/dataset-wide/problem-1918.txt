Those of you who are located in the Northern Hemisphere surely know that it's the season of airborne pollen, which in some people can cause serious allergic hay fever, rhinitis and asthma. I am one of the victims of this epidemic and in addition to sneezing (which I can control to an extent), the most audible symptom is sniffling (reflex of drawing air through nose multiple times to try clear the airways - happens also when you have a cold or runny nose!). Unfortunately I cannot switch these symptoms off when I am at work and some people who are not affected by the illness seem to not understand this and are quite irritated. Two such colleagues whom I work with in different teams were really stern about this and said into my face remarks such as:"Stop that, it's really annoying.", "Can you please stop that? It's getting on my nerves!" My reaction was to try and forcibly repress the sniffling - but that worsens the symptoms... and I start all over again. (FYI for those unfamiliar: unlike colds, you cannot just "blow your nose" and all... hay fever is an allergic reaction i.e. the body thinks you are under attack and tells all of other body parts to work together to compensate). How to deal with such people, especially in the heat of the moment, as soon as they direct the criticism? Honestly, I felt a bit hurt as they were essentially asking me to do something I had no real control over... which is almost a bit like torture. In general, hay fever is a torture, and medicine doesn't always help. What to do in situations like these? P.S.: The symptoms can last for months, so I cannot simply take holiday when everyone else is missing, too. 

tl;dr: Ask yourself, is there an amount of money that would make you feel comfortable doing this? If yes, explain your position to them and say, "sorry guys, the initial agreement was for a normal project - if you want this super secret stuff we can do that too but you're paying extra". Either way, be prepared to walk away. Money is nice but this is a lot more risky than your usual job. Ghost writing costs more than normal writing, so if you agree to being paid the same, you're being underpaid. 

If they only care about you showing up, forget it. Show up at the usual time and patiently wait while the crappy laptop wastes 15 minutes of company time. Maybe bring a book to read while you do it or make some coffee in the meanwhile. If management is very strict, work on something else (check your emails on your phone, look at your calendar/agenda) so they can't badger you over it. The company has their own accountants and productivity experts, if they care they will see the inefficiency reflected in their data and independently solve the problem. Maybe they will even ask you if you have suggestions to improve productivity. Let's say you work 40 hours a week and get $30/hour. Let's also pretend that you spend 20 minutes every day, waiting for the reboots and shut downs, so that you could be spending 15 minutes less if you had a modern computer. That means 3% of your 8 hour day is wasted: The company is paying you $240 for the day and getting 97 units of work, whereas they could be getting 100 units instead if they gave you better equipment. Effectively, they're wasting $7. Is that your problem? Hell no. Your job is to show up at the time the contract says, take the tools the contract says they'll give you, do the work the contract says you will and happily take their money. Budget consulting is extra. You could indeed show up early, and make sure they get 100 units of work like you think they expect. However, if you do that, you will also be working 8.25 hours a day, not 8. This means that you are now spending 41.25 hours at work and getting $29 for each of them (maybe there's another company that would have hired you for $29.5?). Technically, it's not breach of contract since no one asked you to do it, but doing it essentially amounts to giving your company a donation in the form of unpaid volunteer labor. Presumably, your contract does not say anything about mandatory unpaid volunteer work (I don't even think it would be legal) so that you are under no obligation to do it. If you know the manager or owner personally, then yes, it's nice to do it, but so would handing him a $100 bill. On the other hand, if you do get paid for work and not time, it's different: Do whatever it takes to complete your part of the project before the deadline (although this isn't matter of ethics, but practicality: You'll get fired if you don't). If you feel you are forced to spend too much time because of this slow booting, then take it up with management. Even if they are not cooperative, consider just buying your own laptop, and then mentally discounting your salary accordingly when you get competing offers from rival companies. Lastly, a tangent: This company is doing software development, they hire you at a rate high enough that even a few minutes of your time can pay for a laptop, and they hand you a potato that takes 15 minutes (!!!) to boot? Sounds like management needs to get a clue. 

I am typically a top performer and a hard worker, but my seasonal hay fever is making life (work) hell. Besides sniffling, which irritates some of my colleagues, I often get drowsy from medication and otherwise my eyes are itchy and I find it difficult to breathe. This makes it hard to concentrate, and I have noticed that in the past few weeks I have received more admonishing by my manager for not doing a good job; I feel helpless, especially because I never underperform and I always understand, but this time - for some reason - I find it hard to follow what he wants from me / or what he doesn't want me to do - unless something goes wrong and then he tells me that's what I wasn't supposed to do. Our work involves a lot of figuring out things on our own. I don't know whether the drowziness/irritation is causing me to be in "automatic mode" rather than "learn/listen/think", but most certainly I am finding it very hard to absorb new information and apply it at work or think on my own feet. Most of the time I am just doing routine and hoping to go home early every day. (Whereas my work involves a fair amount of non-routine, independent thinking type of work, and in fact for most of my "good years" I was able to figure out things on my own). Generally I it's as if my active mind is "switched off" due to this illness. What I am most concerned about is that my manager repeatedly told me "This is what you were supposed to do earlier" and I find myself confused and lost. What should I do in this situation? UPDATE: Many answers and comments here assume that I might be able to put the cause of the problem (the allergy / its symptoms) under control. I am 100% sure that my current state is as best as I can get, at least for the time being. Reasons include the range of medications I can use due to adverse effects interacting with other conditions I have + other commitments which means I must stay here and at this job. So, given these constraints, how could I deal with the issue? What if my allergy cannot be controlled the season? How can I ensure I don't loose the job? 

I am in a number crunching role. I have invested time after hours to gain knowledge about the business. I want to move to Sales. What should be my next step be? Should I be having a discussion with my boss and express interest or should I approach the Sales hiring manager directly? 

Do you ever have a team meeting where you all share on projects you are working on and whah help you need? If you don't, this would be a great tool to have others including your manager gain visibility on his underutilization. 

I would be vocal in those team meetings and challenge his claims. If he is not getting any work done, that should be made visible. 

I have been performing well in my current role close to a year. There are a few new positions that my employer is looking to fill. My boss keeps hinting about one of these positions to me. It makes sense for me to pursue this opportunity but why is my boss not being direct/approaching me for it? The only reason that I can think of is that he may think that I am not ready yet. Any thoughts appreciated. 

I've been hired in a number-crunching support role for less than 1 year but really want to be customer front facing as the type of work that I thought I would be doing, is not required. I am interested in staying with my current company and they are a ton of sales roles being hired for and really the focus for us as a company. How do I have the chat with my manager without making it look like any of the below: 1. I don't want to spend time in what I was hired to do and prove myself. 2. I am trying to shy away from responsibility and am not a team player. I also want to have a dialogue that lets me try sales go back to my original job if I am not good at it, as I have never tried it before.
