So which one is it? Is Father Gur telling that Rumata will be rewarded for lending Gur his book? Or is he telling that Rumata and Gur will be prosecuted for the possession of this banned work? 

I think it's somewhat humanly-arrogant to assume those characters looked like humans a long time ago. After all, in a series whose protagonist changes appearance as he pleases, things like this shouldn't come as a surprise. 

The closest thing I cold find for Morpheus to resemble Gaiman was like this (the general shape of the face and all the hair): 

I was just re-reading Preludes and Nocturnes, the first volume of Neil Gaiman's The Sandman. In the story titled The Sound of Her Wings, the following conversation takes place: 

Gaiman even mentions in his interview in The Sandman Companion that he also wanted Morpheus to have a rock-star appearance: 

Cain is most probably right in blaming Abel for "sanitising". When was "that time"? When The Dreaming was first established, Dream was its only inhabitant for millions of years - at least according to Neil Gaiman: 

We don't know whether it was an arbalest or a crossbow. To quote (for the lack of a better source) Wikipedia: 

I admit that I haven't read the novel, but a look at the Russian text suggests that by "benevolent Providence" Raskolnikov means God. The relevant quote is Russian is as follows: 

A literal translation in this case is "And then they'll give it back to you!". While all three versions mean the same thing, I found the tone to be different, and it caused me to question the meaning of Father Gur's line. When I read it in Russian, I assumed he was referring to future generations of poets that would be inspired by Father Gur's work. This thought of mine was prompted by an earlier line by Rumata: 

Is this some sort of British humour? From an Internet search I can see that Brussels sprouts seem to be an (in)famous popular Christmas dish in Britain - is that it? The novel isn't set during Christmas, though; the Annotated Pratchett File and this reference file by Tor.com don't mention this scene. 

There may or may not be unhidden spoilers from the novel here. While watching the fourth episode of American Gods, where Laura and Shadow's mutual history has been revealed (to be the first major deviation from the novel), I noticed that the novel didn't explain what exactly it was Shadow did to get in prison, and what part Laura had in it. Firstly, there is this exchange where it is shown that Laura asked Shadow to do something: 

. . . And probably some others. The songs were no doubt used because they gave a sort of an "authentic" feel to the game by introducing some Slavic melodies and Slavic lyrics. However, it's the choice of those particular songs that draws my attention. I'm fairly sure they weren't chosen for their melodies (i.e. the tunes were composed for the game), but I also can't see why they would be chosen based on their lyrics. Except for "Fear a' Bhàta", which is featured in locations associated with the sea in the game (the Skellige isles), the song lyrics do not match the situations the songs are featured in - most of the tracks inspired by songs I list here are played during fighting sequences, while their lyrics sing of peace, prosperity, harvest, and so forth. How do those songs' lyrics fit in the context of the game? Was the choice of those lyrics intentional, or was it purely for "the feel"? 

In The Doomed City ("Град обреченный"), when Andrei finally (spoilers, kind of) finds the Red Building and enters it, he sees a surreal host of people expecting him to a game of chess with some grandmaster. During the game, while they both sacrifice some of their pieces, Andrei somehow realises he isn't actually supposed to play against his opponent, but that they're on the same side, in a sense. And yet he leaves. My questions are as follows: 

Some statistics The website called NovelRank claims to provide information on book sales, taken from the Amazon website. Here's what the all-time chart looks like for The Last Wish (the first book of the series, published by Orbit) paperback: 

In my rough paraphrase, he's saying that any revolution will remove the symptoms, but not the cause of the illness - the illness being evil, and the symptoms being its contemporary carriers (i.e. the people being overthrown). Why contemporary? Because once the revolution (read: the new powers that be) are done with the previous evil, they'll fill that niche themselves. See, e.g. Animal Farm, for an example of this. Solzhenitsyn is disillusioned by the revolution that happened in Russia and let to the Soviets' rise to power, probably because of their treatment of people who did not agree with their vision of the country's future and were vocal about it, like Solzhenitsyn himself (though one didn't even need to be vocal to be sent far far away). 

Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's Good Omens is set in England, and one of the characters is Madame Tracy, who makes her living by doing "occult" seances, either by using a crystal ball or a Tarot deck (which doesn't contain any Major Arcana because their sight was upsetting the clients). The following detail caught my attention: 

Morpheus described Corinthian in more detail in The Kindly Ones: Click for full resolution Clearly, Corinthian was intended to show people that they, of everyone else, are their own antagonists. How could one convey that message in a nice, happy dream? I imagine this method is the most powerful - how to convey the horrors one carries better than with a horror? Nightmares, then, are intended for metaphors and allusions that require this, and not some other approach. In the same way, good and cheerful dreams are supposed to reflect the happiness of the dreamers. If I was a sardonic person, I'd indicate that some people take joy from the suffering of others, but that's another conversation. I'm saying "reflect" because it's what is implied throughout the whole story - that the Endless do not control but execute the will of the living beings. Hob Gadling's story may be a mockery of that - Death will not take him because he doesn't accept death as a part of life. Morpheus himself says that "[the Endless] are [living beings'] puppets": 

Stjepan Sejic's Sunstone was first published as a webcomic on his DeviantArt account (and is still available there), as was his Death Vigil. Linda Sejic's Blood Stain is published on her DeviantArt first, before being published by Image Comics. Question is - why? Why would Image Comics publish something that has already been read by a lot of people online? Even if there are people who haven't read it, it's entirely possible they'll go to the artist's website and read the chapters there (legally and with the artist's blessing), instead of buying the published book (of course, the published version is more polished, but it's still the same). Are those kind of (webcomic to print) comics profitable for publishing houses? (I only know of Image Comics doing this) Or is there some other motivation? 

Overall, no, Morpheus is not in state of existential crisis, and no, Gaiman (for all we know) wasn't influenced by Heine. 

When the readers learn the true version of the event from James, he says Rachel was but a child (15? 12?) during those events. But Rachel is very old. Her "reboot" mechanism has her come back to life with an amnesia (almost) every time she dies. Does it also make her come back in a younger body? How else can it be explained that Rachel (presumably having lived initially to the same visible age as Lilith) was a child during the witch hunt?
