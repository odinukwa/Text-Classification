No. It isn't. Thinking about the future, past or any form of ideation (false thought) are opposite of becoming present. Becoming truly present automatically causes things to empty out and detach. The mind clears. In a practical sense it is not possible to be full of thought and be empty (present) at the same time and in an ontological sense as well because there is only ever one thought, one phenomena happening at any moment in time. After a high level cultivation, the cultivated person can "think without thoughts" by using a type of direct perception called prajna but that is an advanced discussion that is not directly relevant to your questioning. The thing you are talking about "thinking about the future", planning, and the process of making right of your life... this is called the 1st training. It is very important to have the 1st training down well. Nonetheless, it is very different from the purpose and method of the other two trainings that the Buddha espoused: the 2nd and 3rd training, the development of which brings you even deeper into the present... so deep that you find the heart of reality and many Good Things Happen. There is a mutual beneficial interaction among the 3 trainings and respectively with the whole idea of planning for the future and learning to live in the present namely because if you do not plan for the future, the future--when it does inevitably arrive--will be quite uncomfortable and not conducive to Enlightenment. For the most clean and detailed emphasis on the Three Trainings and other crucial Buddhist sets, I reccommend the free book Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha. 99% of what people do is the 1st training (planning, thinking, reflecting, thinking about what to do how to do it). The 2nd and 3rd training are what Buddhism is truly about and is mainly involved with coming to the heart of reality: the present moment. In order to do it one doesn't plan or think... one just does it. Just be present. With practice, this becomes very enjoyable. With more practice this automatically becomes jhana/vipassana practice. 

... yes and no (no, later on) It is a part of Right View to believe in karma in general, including the process of reincarnation. Honestly though karma is pretty common sense and proven by science, psychology, and everything. Reincarnation is a step further with the principle of karma, combined with Newton's 3rd Law. The details of the Thirty-one Planes of Existence are very believable due to its correlations with many other phenomena, I would suggest Professor Bavo Lieven's beautiful, rich, and very motivating cosmological analyses in the first half of his book, "The Mind Experiment" to really get some tasty details on the 31 Planes. And now comes the "no" part of the answer. The Buddha himself said many times throughout the suttas that when you attain 4th jhana, you will either spontaneously be able to see all these realms as easily as you see the current Desire realm. Or one will have to develop the paranormal power to do so if one doesn't spontaneously see (how? read the Path of Purification, a step by step scientific experiment to do all this). It's really just about developing the 1st-4th jhanas (a sign of mental stability and concentration power--not comparable to tripping out on shrooms and seeing such things) and verifying these things for yourself. So... no. You don't have to take it as belief especially to progress with Buddhism. You do have to believe in the concept of karma (which isn't hard... try doing an experiment of bad actions and good actions... I did this 15 years ago for a whole year and I certainly felt the results short-term and long-term) to be practicing Buddhism because it is a definition of Right View, the first step of the Buddhist path. From accepting karma as a principle of the universe (Right View)... reincarnation is a short step. And from there the Thirty One Planes are just arbitrary details that can be verified later! 

Going back to the physics side of things, I would suggest that you also add another mantra to your practice, paricularly one with the "A" vowel in it because there is no "A" vowel in the NMRK mantra. I have been practicing various mantras in conjunction with NMRK and have not had any conflicts but I would suggest to choose Buddhist mantras such as om mane padme hum or the great zhunti mantra. Also practicing anapana (samatha) and vipassana meditation both are conducive to better spiritual practice and the NMRK practice is no exception. 

Intoxication is prohibited but sometimes don't we drink medicine and thus HAVE to get intoxicated? I remember reading somewhere in Buddhist sutra that it is OK to be intoxicated for medicine. Common sense would agree. If one is ill, taking care of the body--one's vehicle for Awakening--is the highest priority. For example I remember my teacher Master Nan saying that when past masters had "Zen sickness" (a feverish state of intense, overwhelming, unstoppable creativity) their teachers often got them drunk to help them fall asleep and snap out of it. When they woke up, they had progressed past the stage safely. Thus, the next question is how much is OK if not sick and trying to walk the fine line of intoxication and still be "Buddhist"? Scientifically speaking, reversatrol is most potent in red wine. There is research that says that it reverses aging and is neo-cardiac in nature (builds and repairs heart cells!)!! There is plenty of scientifically verified evidence about this, look it up. I believe that taking it with such an aim is medicinal because one's intent is to heal the body--not to become intoxicated. Thus, what does it come down to? The 2nd part of the Eightfold path: Right Intention. Remember that the Buddha forbids intoxication NOT medication. But if you find that you are using alcohol "medically" or "socially" and have become reliant on it for sleep, etc. ... then recognize that as a form of chronic intoxication! There is no independently valid reason for it. You gotta think about it and decide what is going on... if you're doing it merely for pleasure or if there is some benefit. Despite all this, I myself do not do ANY sort of intoxication, drinking or smoking and try to eat only what is necessary and specifically nutritional (foods can be considered an intoxicant as well!), keenly aware of the things that I am putting in myself and why. At the worst, I use herbal tea to refreshen myself and warm my hands. Proper meditation and yoga are powerful techniques as well which obviate the need for most worldly addictions including TV, weed, alcohol, cigarettes, etc. I say this with experience because I used to be heavily involved in such a year ago when I did not have stable practices. Summary: So use your thinking muscles and remember that the Buddha forbid intoxication but also forbid self-harm and upholds taking care of your body and mind (but not babying it or getting it addicted, which is intoxication). 

Until one reaches Awakening, there is a pull towards the specific realm that one has achieved in one's culivation. Each realm has a gradient of corresponding rebirths. Desire realms have increasingly subtle forms of pleasure until one pops out into the Form Realm. Formless Realm Form Realm Desire Realm (devas, humans, ghosts, animals, etc.) Most importantly: each realm has a downward pull. These and more rules of Buddhist cosmological rebirth are explained in the brilliant Buddhist summary: "The Mind Experiment" by professor Bavo Lievens. 

There is a bit of interpretation going on with this. Buying meat at the supermarket does count as commanding someone to kill because the force of one's money compels the wheel that is the meat industry. If the meat was purchased, killed, or gotten specifically due to one's preference... it does break the heart of that precept. Even if in one's almsrounds, the favorite house one goes to knows that one really likes that spicy meat (hence the owner went to supermarket and purchased that type). Hence it is important for such monks to practice nonequanimity or even indicate preference for that which is less pleasant but beneficial--a Theravadin exercise. It seems this view broadens things too much. But there are still many instances where "when it is not seen, heard, or suspected (that the living being has been specifically slaughtered for oneself)â€¦.": 

So long as you yourself are interested in Buddhism for its life-benefitting knowledge, you can be sure many others are, too. 

Coming from an Islamic background and having a community/Sangha that is loyal to the religion of Islam, how do you harmoniously integrate yourself and your Buddhist study and practice with the community you were born in including within a mosque? 

"but what is the appeal of moving to a different plane after death?" Reincarnation has a forced nature due to Twelve Nidanas. I would recommend looking at the Tibetan Book of the Dead for further anecdotal information on how we are drawn to reincarnating into certain destinies and then get sucked into that life (pre-birth). Buddhism has as its purpose to stop this forced birth-and-death and control the process like a Tibetan lama, Enlightened master, or bodhisattva is able to, going where he is most needed in the universe, not where his karma (attachments/fears) compels him. "Is it wrong to say that I'm satisfied with where I'm currently at?" It isn't wrong but don't think that it is possible to stay in an existence forever. Even if you live 100 thousand years as a golden immortal (one of the immortals that is discussed in Surangama Sutra) stretching out your existence for as long as possible through various health regimen, eventually it will end and when you reflect back on that time spent as an immortal, it will feel like a flash of lightning... Do what you came here to do and be ready to go. This is why it is best to become a Buddha... the end result is this: dwell in your dharmakaya nature and emanate a new body where you are needed for as long as needed, for the highest good of all... at this point you have no attachment to staying or going. 

Yes, they are totally different beings. But Buddhism is saying that the very nature of your question is incorrect... that there is no self nor no-self. That these individuation of consciousness into selves is by itself incorrect for myriad reasons, one of them being that the 'new Buddha' could not exist without the 'old Buddha' ... and even the 'old Buddha' won't exist without the possibility of the 'new Buddha', someone to help This is especially because in order to become a Buddha, one's resolve for helping others (compassion paramita) must become completely pure, including taking the 1st Mahayana Vow to "not enter Nirvana until all beings are saved." We must look to the Mahayana to explain the concept of Buddahood because a Buddha is certainly different from an Arhat who would rather abide in emptiness (which is still helping beings) but that is another argument entirely.. Anyway, you won't understand till you are Enlightened yourself (not that I am) because the illusion of self-and-other is from whence your question comes in the first place. Also, there is the perspective that bodhisattvas are nirmanakaya manifestations of the Buddha. So if you became Enlightened, it might be because you are a projection body of a Buddha (who has a spiritual parent as well)! Don't let this discourage you from practice though: this and the previous illusion mentioned are important at the Ultimate level of reality and in the relative senses of things, the answer reigns that yes, there is a relative person who mustered up the characteristics necessary to become a bodhisattva/Buddha and escaping forced rebirth and afflictions, consciously able to manifest myriad powers and help others according to causes and conditions. 

People who worry about sentience of plant life as beings are actually considered delusional. I will revise this answer when I find which Buddhist text I read this from but just know that if my memory serves me well, then I remember reading a original Buddhist text Q&A about sentience with the answer ending with a list of delusional trains of thoughts: "there are certain people whom think that since plants are sentient they are also beings, like our brothers and sisters, and to eat them would be wrong. This is a delusion and false thinking." The take home message: just because something is sentient does not mean it is a being. However, this does not give you license to go out trampling every plant you see (anger karma and an unnecessarily decreased beneficial thing in the world--you aren't eating it you are smashing it away). I also add that the attitude of care and love that you approach plants with is excellent and definitely beneficial. 

Yes. This is good to do before and after meditation (as opposed to DURING meditation) for the beginner and advanced student alike. (This is traditionally included in the form of loving kindness meditation e.g. "May I/all beings be free from suffering" etc.) DURING meditation however, whether it is samatha or vipassana, it is generally important to focus on practicing the technique: calmness abiding or naked awareness. On the other hand, one can use affirmations to summon specific qualities. I would recommend only using the same words as found in Buddhist manuals. For example, the Five Faculties are important to have in balance. One can make up affirmations relative for each characteristic. For example for mindfulness: "my mindfulness faculty is balanced and strong" Your question though was aimed at the preliminary aspect of just setting up meditation habit which is absolutely crucial and I would recommend the following affirmations: 

The quote given by Sankha is a great one and I love to read such things but the 1st training is very time-dependent and we have to learn to think critically and live our lives with good, highly informed, moderate principles of the Buddha considering relativities of our day. Anyway... here is my time-and-place sensitive solution to the issue of seeing beggars everywhere: We pay taxes that go to welfare so beggars... they should take opportunity of that welfare instead of just begging! If anything IMO, you should explain the above to a beggar and see if they need help being taken to the social security office (so that they can apply). Also provide them with busfare to go back. It really might be that easy to completely help a homeless person. I have done an experiment and claimed homelessness before and received enough money to feed myself far more than amply and could actually live very comfortably so long as I stayed in a homeless center (or some other place) at night. It would be very easy to live as a monk on welfare... meditating in the jungle at day and finding shelter by night. I have thought about it and experimented with it somewhat... I can verify that the system in the U.S. is very generous with food stamps program. The homeless life that Buddha praised is much easier to do than people think! [I'm glad I experimented with homeless survivalism because I always have that as a backup to compare to working 40 hours a week and straining to make house payments and bills.] The reason homeless people suffer is entirely mental: they suffer from the mental dis-ease of scarcity and self-victimization. I don't believe in donating money to help beggars though. It is quite naive to do so for a lot of reasons... 

Think of the legal system formed as a natural part of the cause-and-effect. If your family and friends were tortured you would quickly become a part of this web of cause-and-effect and fight for justice, too, whether by being a cop, criminologist, etc... The energy created from the criminals act compelled certain people to fight, becoming part of the karmic play called justice system. Anyway, this whole fatalistic idealism is also one-sided and Buddha did not advocate it as complete. Buddha said to never attach to extremes in thinking. To forcibly NOT have a justice system because of fatalism is attaching to an ideal and incorrect thinking (and not just because the Buddha said not to... ANY extreme thought is metaphysically bound to incorrectness). The person holding back the energy to fight for justice even though they are motivated to is still participating in karma. Let what happens happen, justice system just happens to happen naturally, just like maybe one day when biological achievements become more affordable a system of eugenics will or electric cars will take over when they become affordable, etc.
