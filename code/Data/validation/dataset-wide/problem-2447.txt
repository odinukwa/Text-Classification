According to this law, every phenomenon owes its origin to another phenomenon prior to it. It may simply be expressed as “depending on this, this originates”. An example of Dependent Origination in nature is given below: There being clouds in the sky it rains. It having rained, the road becomes slippery. The road becoming slippery, a man falls down. The man having fallen down becomes injured. Here a shower of rain depends on the clouds in the sky. The road becoming slippery depends on the rain. The fall of the man depends on the road becoming slippery. The injury of the man depends upon his fall: Conversely: If there were no clouds in the sky, it would not have rained. Then the road would not have become slippery. Then the man would not have fallen. Then he would not have become injured. So this is understandable and clear to anyone. So can anyone explain (in simplified way)dependent origination step by step with practical examples? 

1) it seeks to eliminate ignorance to end suffering but it avoids to give an explanation how in the first place ignorance arise? you are wrong. Buddhism gives very clear explanation arise of ignorance. which is lack of wisdom. lack of wisdom arises due to imperfection or unsatisfactory. These are fundamental characteristics of nature. 2) Some sect of Buddhism also teach a Buddha nature in every being but fail to explain how a perfect Buddha nature get deluded Buddha nature is a state of our mind. Which is deluded by defilement of mind.Buddha nature signify capacity(develop and having wisdom) to eliminate all sort of defilement in mind, clear and realize the path to final liberation,absolute emptiness or Nirvana and show the path to others. In other words it can be describe as having perfection of wisdom. 3) Buddhism also fail/avoid to explain how it’s possible that an endless liberation is possible. Buddhism has clearly explained the path. Only thing is how ordinary people understand and realize it. Hold and cling so hard to unwholesome views and lack of wisdom. e.g view of self,I,me,mine,ours, almighty god,force,destiny,continuous soul etc... Buddhism clearly expel all those deluded concepts and explained very well. all you need is give up all deluded views and study the basics step by step (come and see) and measure it with your enhanced wisdom and take the decision. Please analyze into depth of Three characteristics of nature Anicca,Dukkha,Anatta, four noble truths,noble eight fold paths, concept of metta, five precepts etc... step by step. without studying basics you will not realize the profound teaching of Buddha. Then gradually read and analyze essential sutta such as heart sutta, cula-sunaata sutta,karaniya metta sutta,maha parinibbana sutta etc... hope this will help you. Thanks and metta. you may gain more and more wisdom to realize the path and have courage to serve the universe. 

I say YYY! When you ask question What is your? answer has to be "our Dhamma",Dhamma is not property of any body and do you agree below? If yes, you are answered or do you have any counter question? 1.If simplified Dhamma as teaching of Buddha. It's also interpreted as behavior or process of nature. E.g when you consider three characteristics(anatta,dukkha,anicca); those are exists in nature and can be observed with our wisdom. Simply Dhamma is how nature is operated or functioned with its fundamental laws and constants. 2.As a Buddhists we accept with wisdom Dhamma as teaching of Buddha.E.g When you consider three characteristics with your wisdom they don't need labels and they are fundamental and basics of nature. Once Buddha declared 2500 years ago it with his wisdom then we can accept with our wisdom in our capacity. If any religious leader declare some thing and not cope with human wisdom and dogma can't be consider as Dhamma. If you are not Buddhist it's better to consider Dhamma "how nature is operated or functioned(or behavior) with its fundamental laws and constants. 

Here is you can get a clue how it like the enlightenment. Reading this sutta superficially will not guarantee the total realization of Nirvana. But surely get clue. The heart sutta; Body is nothing more than emptiness, emptiness is nothing more than body. The body is exactly empty, and emptiness is exactly body. The other four aspects of human existence -- feeling, thought, will, and consciousness -- are likewise nothing more than emptiness, and emptiness nothing more than they. All things are empty: Nothing is born, nothing dies, nothing is pure, nothing is stained, nothing increases and nothing decreases. (So anybody have any idea about how the enlightment feels like)The question is how you imagine the feeling of this kind. you have to think,meditate and find the wisdom to realization. Its like explain color to born blind. Also you get full enlightment after parinibbana or death of person who attained Nirvana through realization. So, in emptiness, there is no body, no feeling, no thought, no will, no consciousness. There are no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind. There is no seeing, no hearing, no smelling, no tasting, no touching, no imagining. There is nothing seen, nor heard, nor smelled, nor tasted, nor touched, nor imagined. Note: After reading above phrase you have to think deeply what is this "condition or state" , can anybody "feel" the above condition, and most important thing is we can assure there is no suffering or pleasure ultimately to feel and so on....... There is no ignorance, and no end to ignorance. There is no old age and death, and no end to old age and death. There is no suffering, no cause of suffering, no end to suffering, no path to follow. There is no attainment of wisdom, and no wisdom to attain. The Bodhisattvas rely on the Perfection of Wisdom, and so with no delusions, they feel no fear, and have Nirvana here and now. All the Buddhas, past, present, and future, rely on the Perfection of Wisdom, and live in full enlightenment. The Perfection of Wisdom is the greatest mantra. It is the clearest mantra, the highest mantra, the mantra that removes all suffering. This is truth that cannot be doubted. Say it so: Gaté, gaté, paragaté, parasamgaté. Bodhi! Svaha! Which means... Gone, gone, gone over, gone fully over. Awakened! So be it! * Emptiness is the usual translation for the Buddhist term Sunyata (or Shunyata). It refers to the fact that no thing -- including human existence -- has ultimate substantiality, which in turn means that no thing is permanent and no thing is totally independent of everything else. In other words, everything in this world is interconnected and in constant flux. A deep appreciation of this idea of emptiness thus saves us from the suffering caused by our egos, our attachments, and our resistance to change and loss. 

There are movement by people to establishment of euthanasia around the world. How ethical is the establishment of euthanasia according to Buddhist philosophy and what is the position of Buddhism on euthanasia? 

Brain and mind co-exits and co-related and interdependent. mind is extinguishes (once neurons stop fire) on brain death and that is the end of mind and consciousnesses. Scientists,rationalists are in this view. They have supportive materials to prove it. 

Assume that the earth destroyed just a fraction of second as a result of massive meteoroid collision and there are only 10000 humans live at the moment. A one human being possess strong qualifications to get the rebirth as human again.(karmic effects,exact "chuthi citta" at the moment of death and etc....). So what happen next as there are no conditions to get the rebirth as human again? 

As per BBC documentary Jesus Christ was a Buddhist monk named Issa. According to documentary Jesus was not crucified and he was trained as Buddhist monk.Further to that Jesus tomb situated in Kashmir Pradesh. How is this valid? (E.g Buddhism is older than Christianity and more possibility of extract Buddhist teaching to Christianity.) If it so what are the similarity of teaching of Buddha and preaching of Jesus? 

Buddhism is all about develop wisdom and wholesome moral and see things as it is. Terrorists are psychopaths suffer from unknown mental decoders due to cling to wrong and unwholesome views. If you respond to them using same methods you don't have difference with them. Just implement and use your wisdom to catch them alive(by firing chemical filled syringes and paralyze) or unconscious(by spreading some gas) and examine and investigate mindset and give proper medicines(defeat their wrong,unethical,immoral and unwholesome ideologies) and counselling(brain wash) using Buddhist teaching for them. killing is not the solution. Don't use lazy and easy way by killing them.Just rehabilitate them as humans. teach them(or brain wash) What is metta,five precept,kindness,eight fold path,four noble truths and Nirvana. That's must be the duty of human worrier in universal army. And this called uncommon wisdom. Don't kill them just cure them.
