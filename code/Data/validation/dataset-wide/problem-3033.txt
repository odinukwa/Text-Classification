A Bloody War by Lieutenant Hal Lawrence. I read this in the 1980's in paperback form. It is a narrative by a Canadian officer serving in the Royal Navy in various anti-submarine operations in the Atlantic, to include the capture of a German submarine. It is very well written, and describes in good detail the challenges of convoy operations and the difficulties of anti submarine warfare. 

I lived behind the Iron Curtain as a child. I grew up in and was immersed in the Cold War for the first half of my adult life. To say that I've both lived with and had to study the cold war in detail is an understatement. 

Visitors from other lands You have listed the most common languages spoken in Jerusalem already -- Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic, and even some Latin -- but the passage in Acts that you refer to answers your question: 

Tom Au has offered a solid answer about the narrow view regarding colonial claims, but those are in 2016 mostly irrelevant. What is more relevant are claims, current and future, made under the current protocols for territorial waters of UN members and exclusive economic zones. This informs the rights to resources in seas and continental shelves. (ILOS is all about that). That makes this answer a bit of a frame challenge. You may as well ask about the American "colonial legacy" in German and Italy, where we still have bases. Wait a minute: there isn't one. Realpolitik, not colonial anything 

The main reason for avoiding the sling is that it is a difficult weapon to use. Requires training to do right EVERY time. So your slinger could expect a short career indeed which would abruptly end the very first time a live grenade slips the string and falls at his feet. Very bad trade-off for more range at questionable accuracy. What you had instead for more range with accuracy was this weapon: The stick grenade. It was widely used during both WWI and WWII. 

While I doubt there was much debt involving monthly payments as compared to today, it is known that (any) calender reform caused a lot of confusion that even today confounds historians. All legal documents were impacted and there even were protests where people reclaimed the days lost as they were believed to shorten their lives. Theoretically if your debt was due between September 3 and 14 in the Britain of 1752 you'd be off for free as these days never existed. In practice I think that did not happen at all as failure to repay your debts made you a felon and punishment was harsh, the law being very much on the side of the creditor. In the end I expect people just muddled through with the courts having a field day. References: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

A note on military jargon: C2 means "Command and Control" and C3 means "Command, Control, and Communication" in Desert Storm era military usage. C3 includes both land line and electromagnetic spectrum communications systems. (How do I know that? When I was an officer, I also got involved in writing military Op Plans for other Joint Operations (even wars) though I was not on that team for Desert Storm {thanks my lucky stars}). And as our esteemed colleague @sempaiscuba pointed out 

No The Iraqi's didn't just use land lines. As explained in "Conduct of the Persian Gulf War, Final Report to Congress{pp. 74-96}" and summarized in a monograph1 by LTC Robert C. Hood, USAF: 

Trading relationships with all nations in the region Freedom of navigation (and how that enables commerce) Access for development (usually joint) to resources A mixed bag of bilateral security agreements. 

Over a thousand chemical tests were run for the next few years in the US. The idea of destroying crops didn't die with the end of WW II. 

Not new: the simplest previous example is related to the Luddite movement in the early industrial revolution era As the industrial revolution grew in its influence, the threat to jobs among textile workers evoked a response to the point that some workers rose up and destroyed factory equipment (the advancing technology that was displacing their labor). 

The Netherlands mainly has so-called 'waterburchten' or castles surrounded by water on all sides. Best-known example is Muiden Castle, founded around 1280. Today it is accessible as museum and mainly features the middle ages and the 17th century. It was almost demolished in the 19th century after a century of neglect but today is regarded as probably the best restored medieval Dutch castle. References: $URL$ $URL$ 

No, we do not. The origin itself is disputed. The 100 senator story is a quote from Livy, but there are alternative theories, both religious and/or hereditary in nature. There are no contemporary sources to confirm and in my opinion there have been multiple sources for what later became the dominant political class. Fact is that the patrician class originated very early and became strictly hereditary for a long period of time. There are some 55 gens known to be patrician and this list is known to be incomplete. Prominant examples are Julia, Fabia and Claudia. Consular status is only one place to look for evidence of patrician status. King Servius Tullius' census is an earlier source. Priesthood was originally a patrician monopoly which declined as plebeian influence grew. Still for a long time only patricians could hold important posts like the office of interrex or interim head of state. Eventually at the time of the late republic being a patrician became a political liability rather than an advantage. During the empire the emperor was required to be a patrician and was the only person that could instate new patricians. These appointments should be well documented but I cannot find at this time a good source.

Those bilateral agreements are entered into with an eye toward the reality that China is The Major Regional Power. As with Central America vis a vis the Americans in the 19th and 20th centuries, the small and medium sized nations in this region are wary of being overwhelmed or pushed around by the local Power. (Heck, look at what the Japanese managed to do in mid-20th century!) These nations can shop around for big / strong friends (or friends of convenience) as a counterbalance. That isn't a colonial legacy, it's realpolitik in action. (To badly quote Otto von Bismarck on power's balance: When there are five powers, make sure we are on the side with three, not the side with two). For their own reasons, the local nations have chosen the Americans as a big / strong friend since this dispute has some far reaching impacts into the future. (You could argue that an advantage the Philippines has is that they know the US very well, and know what buttons to push and what traps not to fall into). The Spratly Islands emerged as a regional "problem" as the potential for resource exploitation ran into the exam question: "Whose turf is this?" Does the US have an interest? Yes. Politically and strategically (from a US point of view) if the SCS becomes a resource node for petroleum/energy, that reduces the importance of the Persian Gulf and spreads out risk. SCS resources being controlled and developed by numerous nations is a preferable situation to One Big Dog in the SCS oil patch (See Saudi Arabia as a model for the latter case). It also spreads the wealth, which tends to encourage trade. America has discovered to its chagrin (see 1973 oil embargo) that it is in America's interest for there not to be One Big Dog in a major oil/energy node. America has chosen to back the ASEAN position rather than get into bed with One Big Dog -- with whom we have massive commercial connections. America could have chosen to back the Chinese. Why not? Residual Cold War antipathy, as well as commercial rivalry, but from a strategic perspective, it's a lot more "balance of power" and support for the variety of allies/friends who are worried about that One Big Dog. That includes Japan, who does not have skin in the SCS game. About Energy and Natural Resources: as you saw with Iraq in 1990/1991, anything that influences the flow of commerce and energy is of interest to every major commercial nation. (The 20th - 21st century global economy is built on energy, see Daniel Yergin's The Prize for a good treatment of that). It wasn't just America who cared. Japan provided cash to support that operation. The Saudis provided billions in out of pocket support. I Claim This Rock! (why do they do this?) Lately, the Chinese look to be doing in SCS what the Greeks and Turks have done in the Eastern Mediterranean and Aegean for decades. If you put your flag on a rock in a coastal area/continental shelf within 12 or 200 miles of your coast, do you get to claim everything within 12 miles of that rock? Within 200, is it all yours for economic purposes? Every few years, in the island and rock filled Aegean Sea, the Greeks and the Turks get into chest thumping exercises over which rock is whose and who just committed an airspace violation near X rock. It usually gets sorted out via a government to government contact, but the big noise is made for political reasons, foreign and domestic. There are other motives, and in the SCS it looks to be money. The Chinese aren't the only ones who do this. Since they are a Regional Power and the rest are not they are more likely to get away with it. The Americans do not see this imbalance as in their national, global interest.
