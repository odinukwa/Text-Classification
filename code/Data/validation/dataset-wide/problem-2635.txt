I perceive 2 different questions which I think I can answer both. 1: The meaning of context 2: Why "if P is true then P or Q is true" is true I will start with the second one: In boolean logic, the inclusive or operation (also called OR) evaluates to true if any one of its operands is true. When P is true in an OR operation, the other operands need not be evaluated because OR needs only one true statement. In "P OR Q", whether Q is true or false does not matter because P being true, OR evaluates to true. An alternative case where the value of Q would matter is the exclusive or (XOR), which says "either P or Q but not both". That is not the case, therefore "P OR Q" is true, whatever Q evaluates to (true or false). By the way: "true OR false" is true, just as "true OR true" is... First question, the meaning of context: The word context has prefix "con", which means "bring together". The "text" is about the syntax, not the semantics. In language, a sentence is a context, consisting of individual words (or pieces of syntax) brought together. When you say "the meaning of something depends on its context", you mean that the semantics vary based on where the piece of logic is situated in the text brought together. In other words, it is situated inside a finite environment composed from its structure, evaluated in that environment, thus yielding a value. I hope I was clear enough... 

So far I have to say that the argument to reduce suffering is the one that resonates the most with me. I personally have no problem eating meat per-se, it is the mistreatment of animals that bothers me. I have not heard a convincing argument for making sentient beings the center of moral concern but maybe it's just my lack of understanding. What I see is that nature is full of examples in which different species feed from each other in a way that's mostly stable and conserves the ecosystem. In the case of meat consumption -- and more generally agriculture -- it's pretty clear that the ecosystem is actually being destroyed which is another very good reason to find a solution where we can preserve the ecosystem. I don't think this implies the absolute need to stop consuming meat. I believe that the idea of plants being able to have experiences is not a far fetched idea since I have seen the progression of the sciences telling us very unintuitive things like: plants have parts that exhibit synaptic-like behavior, plants communicate, plants have a notion similar to that of the self. All of this is expected and predicted by the theory of evolution, namely that we would find many of the features from one species in other species at different stages of development depending on how relevant such feature is to its fitness. I think seeing all organisms as information processing systems reveals the idea that what we call "response to negative stimuli" when talking about plants is nothing more than what we call "the ability to experience pain" in other species. Of course this is not yet a scientific consensus but it looks like it's going in that direction. The fact that all living organisms we know about share a common ancestor makes them equally deserving for the right to exist, thrive and evolve. This is of course independent from us recognizing them as sentient beings. Related links: 

Consider an object as a variable. If you seek a generalized answer, you must seek generalized means to get it. The meaning of property in objects is reversed. The object is not one's property, but it HAS properties. More specifically, it defines attributes, which themselves define the object. If you add yourself to its attributes, you are attributed to the object, which can't be logically right since you and the object do not depend on each other to exist. However, humans sell lands and food to each other. Does this mean that the earth is the humans property? Surprising, I will answer yes because as long as we are there, we need it. It is not the amount of money that gives value to an object, but its scarcity and its importance. Even then, the value is only given in terms of how easy it is to get it yourself versus how hard it is to sell it: offer/demand curve, which is theoretically fair to humans, but does not consider the objects inner properties more than what pertains to human usage. I will conclude stating that it is a necessary evil, even if you build it yourself; because even if humans are satisfied the object itself is not taken into account. Even less in practice. In practice, it is far from being fair to all parties. Value is relative... 

I remember from The blank slate by Steven Pinker that there is such a term for the belief/view that humans can be improved, I believe it's called Human Improvability and it had something to do with whether or not "nature" is fixed or not. I would like to know if there's a technical term that I can use to look up some bibliography and learn more about it. End of the question What follows is just context on how I got here, if the community feels it's not relevant to the question I will remove it. The notion of changing the world has a similar flavor as the one about improving oneself, except that they refer not an individual but to a system external. In any case, I believe the reason it bothers me not because I disagree with it but because I don't really have a strong logical argument to defend it. In part it's also due to agreeing with Nassim Taleb when he argues against interventionism in his book Anti-fragile. Taleb says something like, trying to intervene to improve the state of any complex/big system will most likely result in making it worse and he explains how he uses hokus pokus --convexity analysis or something-- to evaluate whether a given system is more likely to benefit or suffer from intervention. I don't think I can evaluate the validity of Taleb's claims but I have to admit that he started me thinking about non-intervention a lot. Of course there are plenty examples where intervention was very successful, e.g., vaccination, same for the other case. 

Philos=to love, sophem=wisdom. I would define "love" as a passion and "like" as an acknowledgment, or a sort of respect. Most seem to blindly "like" wisdom, though they don't seem to even know it. We humans are by nature philosophers in this respect, but to be a philosopher to me is to have taken a step further and ACCEPT the path to wisdom as an endless trail of a lifetime. That is what a passionate student of wisdom would do. Therefore, I think being a philosopher means being human by nature, but also having taken this next step. Both have "seeking wisdom" in common, but one lacks this understanding. Using boolean logic to answer this question based on these observations: 

I have been reading a little bit about the problem of consuming meat ethically. As much as I find the ethical argument compelling I have some reservations regarding the inconsistency with which it is often applied. Imagine we decide all to go vegan, and soon enough a new scientific consensus is reached that plants can also experience pain. What do we do then? In this scenario, consuming plants would be incompatible with the principle of trying to avoid unnecessary suffering given our current agricultural practices. So the ethical argument for stopping meat consumption seems to me an example of sentiocentrism. Do we need to reframe the debate to include non-sentient beings? Perhaps focus on the stability of the ecosystem? 

A philosophical zombie could not conclude anything inside their mind, because by definition they don't have any minds. They could make it seem like they have made the conclusion, though; but you (again, by definition) would have absolutely no way to tell if this is really so. The fact that the argument in question is "cogito ergo sum" does not change a single thing. 

I am interested in self-learning philosophy, but I am faced with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle: being dyslexic (metaphorically speaking) while reading serious philosophical works (including books, papers, etc.). All of these things (even most SEP entries) are way over my head, because they seem either cryptic (when written by analytic philosophers) or extremely cryptic (when written by continental philosophers). My aim is to understand what philosophical giants had to say as well as to be able to comprehend modern philosophical works. As of now, everything I know about philosophy has come to me from Wikipedia articles, this website, some SEP entries and, most importantly, the book Philosophy: A Text with Readings by Manuel Velasquez. [By 'philosophy' I of course mean its main branches, the discipline itself is way too broad to "learn".] What advice can you give me to achieve my goal? I am really at a loss here.
