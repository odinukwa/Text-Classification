I don't know your boss. But for every boss I have known, you cannot. Going to your boss and saying "Boss, I'm going to hold my breath and intentionally work slower until you give me a raise" isn't likely to get you what you want. Instead, you are giving your boss a reason to fire you - if not now, then the next time they have layoffs. Since you already tried and failed to find another job, it would seem foolish to risk your position at this company with such a threat. You indicate that you are a hard worker. Perhaps that's why you are still there, while 90% of your former co-workers are not. I'd suggest you think long and hard about what you really want. You need to weigh the choice of sticking it out with this company until things improve financially and you can get a raise against trying harder to land a new job - and perhaps moving to a different city. If you decide to stay, keep working hard in hopes you will eventually be rewarded. You may not be, but you indicated that you like working hard and like being recognized for your high performance. Keep asking for a raise periodically, but don't threaten your boss with a slowdown - you don't have the leverage to pull it off. If you decide to leave, find a city that isn't "suffering" and move there for a better, higher-paying job. 

So the obvious solution is - stop doing that! Instead, focus on the requirements. Keeping the deadline in mind, get the project done so that it meets all the requirements, to the level of quality expected. Then, and only then, ask your employer if it is okay to add new features, pretty up the design, etc. (Remember, you may not be the only person on the project. If you decide to add non-required features, someone else may need to test them, documentation may need to be changed, marketing may need to redo screenshots, etc. And each of those folks may have run out of project time.) If your employer now says you can do more - then have fun. But often the trick is getting a system to "good enough", and then moving on to the next revenue-producing project, rather than constantly tweaking an already-complete-enough system. 

Tread carefully here. If you develop the script at their company, you can't sell it to them - they already own it. If you developed it before you actually start working there, you could choose to attempt to sell it to them. But if you take that route, you cannot use it at the company without getting their permission first. I don't advise this route. If you want to create a script for their use, then do so. If you want to create a script to sell, then do it before your engagement with this company starts. 

You have to determine in your own mind if your employer is saying this in order to deny fair compensation, or if it's just a ham-handed way of saying that "we like our people to like their job". While some employers are certainly in the former category, in my opinion more are in the latter. If you think they are just being nefarious, then you need to be prepared to insist on getting whatever you conclude you deserve, and be prepared to move on if you don't get it. If you assume positive intent, then you would interpret their attitude as "We want our employees to work here because they love the work, and not just because they love the paycheck." In that case, you fit the bill exactly, and you are precisely the kind of employee they value. Go into your discussions assuming that of course they want you around and of course they will reward you accordingly. In general, the attitude you bring to any negotiation often tempers the discussions that occur. If you go in with distrust in mind, you'll read the other side's actions accordingly. If you go in with positive intent, you'll see things differently. Only you can know how to correctly interpret this statement you have heard second hand, based on your knowledge of the company, your boss, and what has happened in the past. 

First make sure your question was heard correctly and fully understood. If necessary, clarify things. And make sure you heard and understood the answer as spoken. Then, if the answer is simply wrong, just reply "Okay" and move on to your next question. Don't indicate if the answer was correct or not. If you sense that the candidate might be on the right track conceptually but is fumbling for the correct words, you might offer encouragement or even a hint. If you get a wrong answer that shows some particular insight, you could follow up to ask about the candidate's thought process. But interviews aren't quizzes. Hopefully, you are asking questions that require in-depth answers and not just yes/no, right/wrong. You don't provide a score sheet. Your job as interviewer isn't to teach. It isn't to coach the candidate toward better answers. Your job is to gauge the fit of the candidate for the position being offered. You need to concentrate on your goal, and not spend your time on other tasks. Additionally, remember that candidates are often debriefed by external recruiters. Thus you might need to change your questions repeatedly to avoid rote answers. If you should choose to provide the correct answers for some reason, make sure you do the same for all candidates. You shouldn't pick and choose or discriminate. And as @PoloHoleSet writes, if you must remark on answer errors at least don't interrupt the interview with a running score of Right and Wrong answers. That could easily fluster a candidate and ruin their concentration. 

There's no need to lie, but you don't have to be completely open and blunt about it. "No, I hate this job." is probably not something you want to get around the office, even if true. Instead, try something more along the lines of "Well, every job has parts that you like and parts that you don't like as much. This one is no different. One of the great things about this job is that I'm learning things that are really important to me." Of course, it depends on the context of the question. If it comes from someone who is unhappy with the company/job - tread carefully. Your tendency might be to commiserate and bear your soul. Don't do it. If it comes from someone who is "tight" with the boss - tread carefully. You don't want to express dissatisfaction in a direct pipeline to the boss. And of course if it comes from your boss - tread very, very carefully. You don't want to get cut out of the loop for important projects and learning opportunities because of the fear that you might be quitting soon. Choosing your words and phrasings carefully will let you avoid lying, provide an honest answer, yet not set yourself up for situations you'd rather avoid. 

What you put on your resume depends almost entirely on the kind of job you are seeking, and the kind of company you are applying to. If you were to apply for a software engineering position at my company, including this project would be useless at the best, and harmful at the worst. We are a business in the financial services industry that doesn't deal with iOS devices, and has high security standards. I suspect any project with the words "jailbreak" or "spoof" in it wouldn't be highly regarded here. On the other hand, if you were applying for a software engineering position at a mobile security firm, including such a project would likely be highly desirable. 

Your answer lies in here - "I work at a small company with a very loose structure -- roles are not very clearly defined." Set more clearly defined roles. Perhaps Engineers don't participate in discussions about quotes. Or perhaps you have a pre-meeting before any customer meeting, and hand out the assignments. If the roles are so loose that everyone thinks they should do everything, then nobody can be efficient. Tighten up the roles. 

Just ask. Something like "For personal reasons I would like to know what pay I am expected to get in the coming years. Can we talk about it?" should start things off. Note: I can only speak from the point of view of every US-based small company I've ever worked at. You haven't indicated your locale - perhaps things are different there. 

I think you are exactly right to refer to it in an "Other" section. Another alternative would be to include it in a "Publications" section, if you have one. You should spell out the URL for your blog, rather than just using a hyperlink. Documents like resumes are passed around in many formats (paper, plain text, etc) - some of which don't support hyperlinks. Spelling the URL of the blog out ensures that it doesn't get lost in the shuffle. Be prepared to discuss your blog further, should you be brought in for an interview. It could easily catch an interviewer's attention, and would be a great opportunity for you to expand on the subject. Good luck! 

Since the job was "at will", they could always let the employee go at any time. Thus, the salary increase isn't likely a consequence of that ability. 

It depends on the context of what you mean by "red flag". That fact that your manager is telling you that you haven't come up to speed enough to end your PIP and go back to normal employee status is probably a bad thing. You have tried your best but still haven't succeeded. That's not uncommon with a PIP. The fact that you haven't simply been let go is a good thing. Few folks placed on a PIP end up sticking around (at least in my locale). It might mean that they recognize your efforts, and that you could get there with a bit more time (assuming you actually wanted to do so). Either way, it seems like this is a good thing for you, since you are planning to leave anyway. You now have the ability to remain on the payroll right up until you resign. How that fits into a "red flag" depends on what you mean by the term. I'm not sure why you would care either way. 

It might be okay, but phrasing it that way is rather odd. You would be better off with something that details more about why you need to talk with your boss, and why you need to talk about it face-to-face, rather then over the phone or by email. Something more like: "Boss, I'd like to discuss [fill this in with some of what you need to know] with you when you get a chance. Can we set up a time to talk about this when you are in the office next?" 

Probably. A resume is a sales device. You are selling yourself and your services. In your case you are advertising yourself as "inexpensive". Most likely you'll attract those who consider cost as the most important attribute. This is like advertising yourself as a Hyundai, rather than a Mercedes or BMW. You limit yourself to those who prefer lower-cost automobiles. 

It sounds like you have already reached a conclusion without having enough direct experience. Try to hold that in check, and not pre-judge. There will be plenty of time to collect your thoughts once you are actually asked for your appraisal. If you go into it with a more open mind, you might find that your perception changes once you have more direct contact with him. 

This might be an important connection for you but is very likely low on the to-do list of the person you are trying to connect with. Give it more time. 24 hours isn't nearly enough. And realistically if you ever apply for a job at this company again everything could be changed anyway. Your connection might no longer be there or the job may not be in this person's realm. Stop worrying so much and continue on with your job search. There's nothing you could do about it now anyway. 

Yes, it's completely appropriate. I've done the same when I had a departing manager. And as a manager, I've always offered to be a future reference for people I worked with as I was leaving. That said, always contact your references just before you include them in the list you give a potential employer. It's important to give them a heads-up to expect a reference call or email. 

Yes, you could do that. Don't let company A know about it until you are sure you have a solid offer. Company A can decide to let you go, once they know you are planning to leave - they could just say "goodbye" at that point. I almost never get into bidding wars for people on my team. In my experience, if they want to leave for more money now, offering them a bit more is unlikely to keep them around for very long. Even if I were to give them more money now, they will almost certainly leave for even more money soon. While I wouldn't fire someone who came to me saying they got an offer from another company, I'd very likely to just start planning their exit. 

It might cause problems, but it might not. Having a business fail isn't usually the problem. Switching from being an employee to a business owner and back to an employee again is usually the main issue. I have hired lots of people who ventured out on their own, then (for whatever reason) decided to become an employee again. One thing that I always worry about when hiring someone in that situation is - what is the chance that they will leave soon to try again? I spend a lot of time talking about that with candidates during their interviews. I don't want to hire someone for a short time while they gather their thoughts, only to have them venture out once again. I like to only hire folks who will be around for a while. If you end up in that situation, you want to be clear in your own mind what you want to do - start another business eventually, or give up the idea and go back to being an employee. If the former, you might consider being a contractor for a while, rather than a permanent employee. As Joel Etherton wisely states in his comment: managing contracts and billables and invoices and all the other lovely things about it help prepare people for the business side of things. If the latter, then you want to be clear in your own mind how you can convince a potential employer during interviews that you really do want to be an employee again. 

It's reasonable, but you will certainly find it very hard to get contracts - particularly initially. Freelancers generally rely on their reputation and contacts as aids in securing contracts. Right now, you have little or none. Perhaps you have a network of friends that can help you get started. At least you need to be prepared financially for some lean times early on.
