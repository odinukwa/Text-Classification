STEP 4: What if those colonies on other planets had not travelled from the Earth, but had evolved there? If we reach the same end result via a different route, why should our beliefs differ? These steps bring us to the conclusion that, if other sentient species exist, we should expect ours to have an unusually high population. Take a look at the pie charts below to get an idea of just how different we may be. 

Could animals evolve to live in such a harsh environment in the same way that in could on the day side? If animals could exist on the night side, how would they survive, with the lack of vegetation, light and heat? If an animal from the day side were to get caught in the night, could it survive and for how long? 

I can actually think of many ways for them to "enjoy" wars, but in the long term, since they are immortal, they'd learn that wars achieve nothing. Let me explain: if they know they are all immortal, they will probably focus on a guerrilla with ambushes and imprisonment rather than anything else. Maybe kidnapping and maybe sabotage (but hey, even if they are greedy, they can anyway live without crops, right?). So after a couple generations the war will reach a standstill, where factions simply don't go in some territories (fear of being taken by the other faction and spend the eternity inside a volcano?). Eventually their arrogance and ignorance (they are human-like, right?) will make some people think that they could instead reign, so I would focus more on "secret" civil wars, kidnappings and tortures rather than a proper war. 

The tail dawned by the Ankylosaurus was impressive, but not unique, Gastodons also had it and while not the same body as Dryosauridae, theoretically, evolution could favor an adaptation of this iconic design. 

Sorry for the legend blocking Europe and most of Asia, it was still the best quality wind current map I could find.

Some Background The government is very good at catching people. Even the few who can keep away from them are forced into a life of running. But there is a new threat that all of Earth's governments face together, Dave the Teleporter. He was born in southern Russia and ever since he learned he could teleport, he has been on a crime wave, stealing billions worth of products from around the world. The united nations agree that he must be stopped. Sadly, only after agreeing to stop him, they realized that they have no idea how to. They tried handcuffing him but he disappeared, they tazed him and the barbs fell to the dirt, they shot at him but he teleported away before hitting the ground. They have requested the help of Earth's greatest minds to come up with a solution. A Few Details of Dave 

A lot of people believe that a chip cannot be tampered with from a distance. This is not true, especially if you are setting your story in a future where technology has evolved. Assuming your ID must be wirelessly communicated, I assume that the informations (whatever they are) stored in the RFID-like chip are encrypted. The problem with traditional cryptography, though, is that if you have the key(s), you have everything you need to decrypt your code... And the keys are too stored somewhere. Quantum cryptography is said to be impossible to hack due to the fact that a "bit" of information alters its state when it's read (from third parties). Problem is: it alters its state when it's read by a machine too... and if a machine is expecting a certain sequence to launch the missiles, it means that there's too a key involved... Assuming the worst case, terrorists have the key(s). A wireless transmission of a code is really a bad idea, since what the terrorists would do is simply set a smart-antenna to track the chip from a distance, and read its informations. What's indeed difficult is actually to get to the president physically. So why bother with a chip, when a retinal scan (some users already pointed out that this is impossible to hack - and why can't the scan work with sunglasses? They can be "smart" ones, or the scanner can be), voice recognition, fingerprint analysis, password and a titanium bullet with a code inside hidden in the body are all things that need a physical abduction? In short: I wouldn't rely on a (single) code stored on a (single) chip. Especially if transmission is considered. 

The Mokèlé-mbèmbé (meaning "one who stops the flow of rivers") is a legendary water-dwelling creature of Congo River basin folklore, loosely analogous to the Loch Ness Monster in Western culture. It is often described as looking like a small sauropod, with a body roughly the size of a hippo. Obviously a saurpod living, in even the most remote jungles, is rather unlikely. Other than being simply a dinosaur, what other animal could describe the Mokèlé-mbèmbé? A list of all of the Anatomically Correct questions can be found here Anatomically Correct Series 

As I pointed out in some comments, let belief do the trick. Your question pretty much implies that creature C has to provide A & B in both their universes a tangible/perceivable proof (which sounds to me a lot like scientific method), but since the dimensions are orthogonal, each inhabitant of these planes would not have the possibility to glimpse the existance of "the others". Let C be a creature A e B look up to (God?) in both worlds. Through belief of C's words, A could believe in B and vice versa. Let me write an example: suppose my terrestrial life and the hell are orthogonal. Through religion I believe in the existence of hell, therefore I don't commit crimes or such in order to preserve my soul in the afterlife. By acting like I do, I am altering what happens/will happen in hell (I am wildly assuming that hell has no time). The two dimensions are entwined, but I never had the possibility to experience any proof about it being real. 

If, on the other hand, they never left the water, then they will be a fish and in turn, their tails will work like fish tails; Horizontal. 

Animals such as bears are a large competitor for prey animals and require a lot of meat to keep happy. You don't want your ride to decide that you will make a nice snack. Keeping a large bear well fed is very expensive, that is why so many are in shelters or have to be put down, they cost too much to keep, and that is as a pet with an easy life, not a hard working war mount. Bears are also usually solitary, partly because it is easier to feed fewer mouths when you get bigger. Wolves are pack animals and a human can replace a wolf as the leader. This will not with bears, there is no such thing as a bear pack (thank god). Most animals we ride are herd animals, they are easy to feed, usually grass and other vegetation (often stuff we can't digest well) so there is no competition for food and they are generally not going to try and kill each other. 

Am I the only one here thinking about bioengineering trees so that their wood becomes more weapon-ready? I'm talking about super venomous resins, super elastic / super sturdy materials, exploding wood, or whatever you can think of. 

What about "Thanatógon(s)" and "Biógon(s)"? Those come from death = Thánatos (θάνατος) / life = Bíos (βίος) + the word "puppetteer", which is translated into "Góns" (γόης). I strongly disagree with people using "Nekros" as "Death", since it actually means "Dead" (a person who is deceased). The divinities they devote to could indeed be the "Moirai": 

I have a world with days lasting 9 years. The inhabitants of this world have taken to migrating across the globe to avoid the deadly night, keeping themselves in a sweet spot. One of the biological quirks of the people living here is that sleep isn't a thing. Similar to dolphins, they sleep with only one hemisphere at a time, allowing them to maintain consciousness at all times. This allows them to get their required sleep while still being able to migrate throughout the 'day'. As I began to develop the mythology and cultures of this world, a question popped into my head that would heavily affect everything this species does; how does their consciousness work. There are various signs that our right brain is really its own intelligent consciousness that works with our speaking left brain; But on a species where each half is only conscious for half the time, would they only be able to speak half the time? What about the other things? The right half of your brain dominantly controls things such as spatial abilities, face recognition, visual imagery and music. While the left half deals with language, math and logic. Would a species that only uses half the brain at any moment only possess one half of these features at any given moment? Would it have two separate personalities? Or is there other things that I (admittedly not a neuroscientist) just am not seeing? 

It's not a safe place. The bosses are secretly studying a way to upload themselves into the machines, and while for religious matters the protagonist won't create an army of himselves, the bosses would. Each boss is provided with a save point in order to study it, with the order to upload himself/herself/itself only if he/she/it has 100% chance to succeed. Bosses, though, are not overconfident, and that's why they put an entire dungeon to protect that point, and why they didn't try that yet. 

but I'd believe normal people wouldn't want to call themselves like semi-gods, nor would they dare to call themselves "the ones who know [insert divinity name here]". TWIST: The "Moirai" could also actually be their enemy, since they'd no more shape human destiny. 

On the internet exists a comprehensive guide to the construction of an entire language, appropriately named; The Language Construction Kit. I was going to copy/paste it but if I did, it would not fit! In the thousands of words it contains, you will find guides to sound choosing, word plotting, word formation, Grammar, writing systems and more. 

Robots are people to! Have you seen Chappie? In it, a police robot named Chappie becomes sapient and, despite ignoring Asimovs laws, he is quite peaceful, same thing with Johnny 5. Now keep in mind that in both of these situations, humans refuse to acknowledge AI robots as sapient and often take cruel measures against them. Now if (using a complex series of events) robots are accepted into our society as 'people' (Ei Overwatch) then, if they even follow the laws, they are most likely to follow the fifth order.
