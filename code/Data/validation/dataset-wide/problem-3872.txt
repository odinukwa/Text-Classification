When $\mathfrak{g}$ is non-zero and finite dimensional over $k$, its restricted enveloping algebra $u(\mathfrak{g})$ is never a domain. To see this, note that $u(\mathfrak{g})$ is itself finite dimensional over $k$ (of dimension $p^{\dim \mathfrak{g}}$ by Jacobson's PBW theorem) so if it's a domain it must be a division ring. But the definition of $u(\mathfrak{g})$ by generators and relations shows that $u(\mathfrak{g})$ always has a proper ideal --- the augmentation ideal $\mathfrak{g} u(\mathfrak{g})$. This is a contradiction. When $\mathfrak{g}$ is infinite dimensional over $k$, it can happen that $u(\mathfrak{g})$ is a finitely generated domain. Here is an example: let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the $k$-linear span of the monomials $X, X^p, X^{p^2}, X^{p^3}, \ldots$ inside the polynomial algebra $k[X]$ and view it as an abelian restricted Lie algebra with the obvious restricted structure $x^{[p]} = x^p$ for all $x \in \mathfrak{g}$ (the latter calculated inside $k[X]$). It turns out that actually $u(\mathfrak{g})$ is isomorphic to $k[X]$ in this case, hence $u(\mathfrak{g})$ is a domain. Note that if $p = 2$ and we view $k[X]$ as a graded ring with $\deg X = 2$, then $\mathfrak{g}$ is a graded restricted Lie algebra concentrated in even positive degrees and finite dimensional in each degree --- i.e. it satisfies your conditions. Starting from an arbitrary group $G$, it is possible to cook up a restricted graded Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g} = \bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty (D_n/D_{n+1}) \otimes_{\mathbb{F}_p}k$. Here $D_1 \geq D_2 \geq D_3 \geq \cdots $ is the so-called modular dimension series of $G$, defined by Lazard's closed formula $D_n = \prod_{ip^j \geq n} \gamma_i(G)^{p^j}$ where $\gamma_i(G)$ is the lower central series of $G$ defined by $\gamma_1(G) = G$ and $\gamma_i(G) = [G, \gamma_{i-1}(G)]$ for all $i \geq 2$. The $p$-power operation on $\mathfrak{g}$ is induced by the $p$-power map on the group. Then the theorem of S.A.Jennings asserts that $u(\mathfrak{g})$ is isomorphic to the associated graded ring of the group algebra $k[G]$ with respect to the filtration by powers of the augmentation ideal $I$ of $k[G]$: $u(\mathfrak{g}) \cong \bigoplus_{n=0}^\infty \frac{I^n}{I^{n+1}}$. The example I gave above is obtained by taking $G = \mathbb{Z}$. Similar examples can be obtained by taking $G$ to be a uniform pro-$p$ group of rank $d$; then $\mathfrak{g}$ will be an abelian, restricted graded Lie algebra with $u(\mathfrak{g})$ isomorphic to the polynomial algebra $k[X_1,\ldots, X_d]$. You can find a good account of this material in Chapters 11 and 12 of the book "Analytic pro-$p$ groups" by Dixon, Du Sautoy, Mann and Segal. 

Let $\rho : G\to \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb Z_p)$ be a crystalline representation of $G=\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p/\mathbb{Q}_p)$. For any non zero element $a\in \mathbb{Z}_p^n$ , it spans a rank one $\mathbb{Z}_p$-submodule $L_a$. Now consider the subgroup $H$ of $G$, $H=\{g\in G| g(L_a)\subset L_a\}$. Does $H$ have finite index in $G$, i.e .$[G:H]< \infty$? 

Let $X_1,X_2$ be two smooth proper schemes over $\mathbb{Z}_p$, such that their reduction modulo $p$ are isomorphic as $\mathbb{F}_p$-schemes. Then is it true that the geometry etale fundamental groups $\pi_1^{alg}(X_1\otimes \bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p)$ and $\pi_1^{alg}(X_2\otimes \bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p)$ are isomorphic? 

Let $X$ be an Abelian variety defined over a number field $K$, suppose that it has a good reduction over a fine place $\mathfrak{p}$ of $K$. Let $G_{\mathfrak{p}}$ be the local Galois group for $K_{\mathfrak{p}}$. Let $s$ be a Hodge cycle in $H^n_{B}(X^{an}, \mathbb{Q})$, the Betti cohomology. By comparison theorem there is a canonical isomorphism $H^n_{B}(X^{an}, \mathbb{Q})\otimes \mathbb{Q}_p\cong H^n_{et}(X,\mathbb{Q}_p)$, where the right hand side of the equation is the etale cohomology. So via this isomorphism, $s$ corresponds to a etale cycle $s_{et}$. Then Does Deligne's absolute Hodge theory implies that $s_{et}$ is fixed by a finite index subgroup of $G_{\mathfrak{p}}$. 

Let $X$ be a compact Riemann surface, Hitchin-Simpson correspondence over $X$ says that irreducible representations of $\pi_1(X)$ one-to-one correspondend to stable Higgs bundles with vanishing Chern clssess over $X$. Now suppose we fix a representation $\rho$ of $\pi_1(X)$, then it corressponds to a stable Higgs bundle $(E,\theta)$ over $X$. Fix the underlying differential surface of $X$, but change the complex structure and obtain a new Riemann surface $X'$. Still by the Hitchin-Simpson correspondence over $X'$, the irredubible representation $\rho$ corresponds to a new Higgs bundle $(E',\theta')$ on $X'$. My Question is how describe the change $(E,\theta)\to (E',\theta')$ by the change $X\to X'$. For example we may just assume $E= L\oplus L^{-1}$, and $\theta: L\cong L^{-1}\otimes \Omega_{X}$, where $L^2= \Omega_X$. Then what is $(E',\theta')$? 

I am a little confused about the log structure of Witt ring and its Frobenius map. Let $k=\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p$, $W:=W(k)$ the Witt ring. We know that to deal with the semistable reduction, i.e. scheme over $W$ etale locally of the form $X=Spec(W[x_1,\cdots, x_d]/(x_1\cdots x_d-p))$, if we want to say that $X$ is log smooth over $W$, we need the following log structure $(Spec(W),M,\alpha)$, $\alpha : M=W\setminus\{0\}\hookrightarrow W$. However, we know that $W$ has the Frobenius map $\sigma$, the corresponding map on the monoid $M$ is the restrction of $\sigma$ on $W\setminus \{0\}$. If we consider the closed point of $Spec(W)$, such that $(Spec(k),N, \beta)\hookrightarrow (Spec(W),M,\alpha)$ is exact closed immersion, then the log structure $N$, is the following $N=(k\setminus\{0\})\oplus \mathbb{N}$, and $\beta: N\to k$, is defined as follows; $(b,0) \to b$ and $(b,n)\to 0$, for $n>0$, $b\in k\setminus\{0\}$. We then see that the Frobenius map $\sigma$ induced a map on $(Spec(k),N, \beta)$, which on the underying scheme is just the usual power $p$ map on $k$. But the map on the monoid is the direct sum of power $p$ map and identity map , i.e. $N\to N$, $(b,n)\to (b^p,n)$, which is different from the absolute Frobenius map. Because we know that for any log scheme $(Y,L)$, the absolute Frobenius map on the monid $L$ is just the power $p$ map, i.e. $l\to p\cdot l$. On the other hand , when deal with absoulte (relative )Frobenius map, people ususally consider the trivial log structure on $W$ and $k$. So does it means that one can not deal with semistable reduction and Frobenius at the same time ? For example, if one want to generalized the calssical Cartier Descend theorem over smooth curve (which said that a vector bundle with connection is come from Frobenius pull back iff its $p$- curvature vanishing ) to node curves, one will have problem? 

Take $R = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{F}_q$ for distinct primes $p,q$ and $\mathfrak{m} = qR$. Then $\hat{R} \cong 0 \times \mathbb{F}_q$ is isomorphic to an ideal in $R$, so $Hom_R(\hat{R}, R) \neq 0$. This $R$ isn't complete with respect to $\mathfrak{m}$ since $R \neq \hat{R}$. 

Let $A = k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]$, let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the ideal $(x_1,\ldots,x_r)$ in $A$ and let $I$ be the ideal $(p_1,\ldots,p_t)$ in $R$. The assumption $\sqrt{AI} = \mathfrak{m}$ implies that $\mathfrak{m}^u \subseteq AI$ for some integer $u \geq 1$. Hence $A / AI$ is a finite dimensional vector space over the ground field $k$. Since the polynomials $p_i$ are homogeneous, $A / AI$ is actually a graded $k$-vector space. Choose homogeneous elements $v_1,\ldots, v_n \in A$ whose images span $A / AI$; then these images also generate $A / AI$ as a graded $R$-module, so we may write $A = AI + \sum_{i=1}^n Rv_i$. Let $Q = A / \sum_{i=1}^n Rv_i$. This is a positively graded $R$-module such that $QI = Q$, by construction. If $Q$ is non-zero, let $t \geq 0$ be least such that $Q_t \neq 0$; then for any $j \geq t$, $Q_jI$ consists of homogeneous elements of degree strictly greater than $t$ (since $\sqrt{AI} = \mathfrak{m}$ forces $\deg p_i \geq 1$ for all $i$). Then $QI \subseteq \oplus_{j > t} Q_j$, a contradiction. (This argument is called the graded Nakayama Lemma). So in fact $Q = 0$ and $A = \sum_{i=1}^n Rv_i$ is a finitely generated $R$-module. Therefore $A$ is an integral extension of $R$. 

How about the Harish-Chandra isomorphism, which computes the centre of the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{g}$? 

It's true if $A$ is Noetherian. For any $A$-algebra $C$ and any ideal $J$ in $A$, note that $C/JC$ is isomorphic to the tensor product algebra $C \otimes_A A/J$. Now for any $n \geq 0$, $A/I^n$ is a module over $A^*$, and the multiplication map $A/I^n \otimes_A A^* \to A/I^n$ is an isomorphism, since $A$ is Noetherian --- see for example Proposition 10.13 of Atiyah and Macdonald's "Introduction to Commutative Algebra". Let $T = A^* \otimes_A B$. Then we get isomorphisms $T/I^n T \cong A/I^n \otimes_A (A^* \otimes_A B) \cong (A/I^n \otimes_A A^*) \otimes_A B \cong (A/I^n) \otimes_A B \cong B/I^nB$. Now pass to the inverse limit to obtain an isomorphism $T^* \stackrel{\cong}{\longrightarrow} B^*$. 

The answer is yes. Let's say that a domain $R$ has the intersection property if every non-zero two-sided ideal $I$ of $R$ has non-zero intersection with the centre of $R$. The result follows from the Theorem and Lemma below. 

Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$. For an ample divisor H, we can define the slop of vector bundle with respect to $H$, then we can define stablilty of vector bundle with respect to $H$. However it might be possible that an $H$-stable vector bundle is no longer stable with respect to another ample divisor $H'$. On the other hand the famous theory of Uhlenbeck-Yau about irreducible representation and stable bundle implies that if a vector bundle has trivial Chern classes, then its stablility does not depend on the ample divisor. I wonder is there a direct proof of this fact without using Uhlenbeck-Yau thoery? A natural question to ask : does the statement hold in charateristic p case ( one may need some condition like algebraic closed field, the variety has $W_2$-lifting, etc.)? 

everyone, I want to ask is there any result in the literature similar to the following: Let $ X=\mathbb{P}^1\backslash \{0,1,\infty\}$, then $X$ is defined over $\mathbb{Z}$. Let $X_{\mathbb{Q}}$ denote the its generic fiber, and for any prime number $p$, $X_{\mathbb{Q}_p}:= X_{\mathbb{Q}}\times Spec(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ be the base change to $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Consider the global section of log differntial form $\Omega_{X_{\mathbb{Q}}}(log(0,1,\infty))$. It has a basis $\{\frac{dz}{z},\frac{dz}{z-1}\}$ , where $z$ is the standard affine coordinate. The result is : For any global section of log 1-form $\omega=a\frac{dz}{z} + b\frac{dz}{z-1}$, with $a,b\in \mathbb{Z}$, one can associate a system of representation of algebraic fundamental group. More explicitly, for any prime number $p$, such that $p\nmid a$, or $p\nmid b$, then one has a nontrivial rank two $\mathbb{Z}_p$-representation of $\pi_1^{alg}(X_{\mathbb{Q}_p})$, where $\pi_1^{alg}$ denote the algebraic fundamental group, that is $$ \rho_{\omega,p}: \pi_1^{alg}(X_{\mathbb{Q}_p})\to GL_2(\mathbb{Z}_p). $$ It has the following property: (i): the restriction of $\rho_{\omega,p}$ to the geometry $\pi_1$ is an nontrivial extension of two trivial representation, so when restricted to geometry $\pi_1$, it will never be trivial. (ii): If one has a $\mathbb{Q}_p$-point of $X_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$, then the induced Galois represention of $Gal(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p/\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is an extension of trivial representation and Tate twist $\mathbb{Z}_p(1)$. I really want to know wether there is a trivial way to realize the above association. Thank you! 

F.Kato has a statement said that a log smooth curve $f:(X, M,\alpha)\to (k,N,\beta)$ where $k$ is an algebraic closed field and $N$ is some fine log structure on $k$, is equvalent to pointed node curve in a paper "Log sooth deformation and moduli of log smooth curves". I am quite confused with the log structure $N$ on k, when one associate a log smooth curve to a pointed node curve. Let's consider the following example, $X$ has only one double point $x$, and only one marked point $s$, and $x\neq s$. Let $A=k[t_1, t_2]/(t_1t_2)$, $U=Spec (A)$ be an etale neighborhood of $x$ , with $x= (0,0)$, we see that the log structure over $U$ is defined by the following $\alpha:M_U:=k^*\oplus N^2 \to A $ by $\alpha(k_1,n_1,n_2)= k_1t_1^{n_1}t_2^{n_2}$, and the log structure $N:=k^*\oplus \mathbb{N}$ and the map $\beta:N\to k $ defined by $\beta(k_1,0)=k_1$, and $\beta(k_1,n)=0$ for $n>0$. The map $f$ on the monoid is defined by the following $f^0:N\to M_U$, $f^0(k_1,n)=(k_1,n,n)$. On the other hand Let $B=k[T]$ , $V=Spec(B)$, be an etale neighborhood of $s$, with $s=(0)$. Then the log structure on V is $M_V:=k^*\oplus \mathbb{N}$ with $\alpha(k_1,n)=k_1T^n$. Now F. Kato claimed one extend $M_U$, $M_V$ to $X$, and define $M:=M_U\oplus_{\mathcal{O}^{\times}_{X}} M_V$, then $(X, M, \alpha)$ is log smooth over $(k, N, \beta)$. My question is how to define the map $f^0 : N\to M$ on the monoid? Over $U$, it is already given above. But what about over V, it seem that it is impossible to define such a map, for one need to satisfy the following relation: $ \alpha\circ f^0= i\circ \beta$, where $i: k\to k[T]$ is the natural map. And one fine that $\alpha\circ f^0(k_1, n)=i(0)=0 $ for $n>0$, however $0\notin Imge( \alpha)$, so it is impossible to define $f^0$. 

Instead of updating my previous answer, I've decided to add a new answer in order to keep it short(ish). In the comments following his original question, TonyS added the extra assumption that $R$ is finitely generated over $A$. This is a strong condition, since it makes $R$ very close to being commutative. Moreover $R$ is known to be an integral domain, and a maximal order in its division ring of fractions $B$. Under these assumptions the $A$-torsion-free module $M$ is actually $R$-torsion-free. To see this, let $F$ be the field of fractions of $A$; then since $R$ is finitely generated over $A$, the central localisation $F \otimes_A R$ is an integral domain which is finite dimensional over the field $F$, and is therefore a division ring; thus $F \otimes_A R = B$. Now $F \otimes_A M = F \otimes_A (R \otimes_R M) = (F\otimes_A R) \otimes_R M = B \otimes_R M$ so the kernels of the localisation maps $M \to F \otimes_A M$ and $M \to B \otimes_R M$ coincide. Thus $M$ is $A$-torsion-free if and only if $M$ is $R$-torsion-free. Now let $N$ be a finitely generated $R$-bimodule which is torsion-free on both sides (for example $N$ could be $\omega_R$). Then $N \otimes_R M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module and therefore a finitely generated $A$-module. To study the torsion $T$ in this module, we study its support $Supp(T)$ in $Spec(A)$, or equivalently, the primes above the annihilator $Ann_A(M)$. Clearly $0$ is not in this support because $T$ is by definition a torsion $A$-module. I claim that there are no primes in $Supp(T)$ of height $1$. Suppose for a contradiction that $P \in Supp(T)$ has height $1$; then localising $A$ and $R$ at $P$ produces a new maximal order $R_P$ which is free and finitely generated as an $A_P$-module. But $A$ is a commutative regular local ring, hence a UFD by Auslander-Buchsbaum, so $A_P$ is a discrete valuation ring. Since $R_P$ is finitely generated over $A_P$, it must be semilocal; since $R_P$ is also a maximal order, under these conditions it is known that $R_P$ is actually a right and left principal ideal domain: see Proposition 2.9 and Theorem 2.8 of the book "Ordres Maximaux au Sens de K.Asano" by Guy Maury and Jacques Raynaud. Therefore the module $N_P$ is actually free over $R_P$ and hence $N_P\otimes_{R_P} M_P \cong M_P$ has no torsion. But this module is just $(N \otimes_R M)_P$ and by the exactness of localisation, $T_P$ is a torsion submodule of $(N \otimes_R M)_P$ and is therefore zero: thus $P \notin Supp(T)$, proving the claim. Now $A$ was assumed to be of dimension at most $2$, so we see that $Supp(T) \subseteq \{ \mathfrak{m} \}$ where $\mathfrak{m}$ is the maximal ideal of $A$. This is the best possible result, because $N \otimes_R M$ can easily have $\mathfrak{m}$-torsion, as the following (commutative!) example shows. Let $R = A$ and $N = M = \mathfrak{m}$. Pick a regular sequence $x,y$ in $\mathfrak{m}$, so that $0 \to A \stackrel{\alpha}{\to} A^2 \to \mathfrak{m} \to 0$ is a projective resolution of $\mathfrak{m}$, where $\alpha(a) = (ay, -ax)$. Then it's easy to see that $\mathfrak{m} \otimes_A \mathfrak{m} \cong \mathfrak{m}^2 / \alpha(\mathfrak{m})$. Now the image of the element $(y,-x) \in \mathfrak{m}^2$ in $\mathfrak{m}^2 / \alpha(\mathfrak{m})$ is non-zero and is killed by $\mathfrak{m}$, so the $\mathfrak{m}$-torsion submodule of $\mathfrak{m} \otimes_A \mathfrak{m}$ is non-zero. So to show that $\omega_R \otimes_R M$ has no torsion, one would have to show that $\omega_R$ doesn't "look like" $\mathfrak{m}$ (or perhaps a finite direct sum of copies of $\mathfrak{m}$) as an $A$-module. One way to ensure this is to perhaps try to show that $\omega_R$ is reflexive as an $R$-module, since this would help you to show that there are no essential extensions $E$ of $\omega_R$ such that $E/\omega_R$ is $\mathfrak{m}$-torsion.
