Let's look at the energetics of removing material from a white dwarf. Very, very approximately, the energy required to remove 1 kg of material from the surface of a massive object out into space is of order its potential energy: $-G M / R$, where $M$ is the mass (in kg) of the object and $R$ is its diameter in meters. To remove 1 kg from the surface of the Earth requires about 60 megajoules. To remove 1 kg from the surface of a 1-solar-mass white dwarf (radius about 0.01 times that of the Sun) requires about two hundred terajoules. That's about 50 kilotons TNT equivalent. So on one level, it's feasible. (Leaving aside the engineering problems.) It's also an insanely expensive way to gather relatively common elements. Now, there is a way of letting nature do it for you. Classical novae are binary systems with a white dwarf and a low-mass main sequence star which is orbiting so close to the WD that it overfills its Roche lobe, leading to accretion of material from the outer part of the main sequence star onto the surface of the WD. Over time, this material builds up until a runaway thermonuclear reaction takes place, which blasts a mixture of accreted material and original WD material out into space with velocities of several thousands of kilometers per second. (This may prove somewhat inconvenient to collect.) So, provided you're willing to wait several thousand or tens of thousands of years between classical nova outbursts, you can extract material from a white dwarf this way, although it will be mixed with accreted material from the companion star and fresh thermonuclear byproducts (probably mostly helium) from the runaway burning of the nova outburst. If you really want to collect "stellar-mass" quantities of matter, it would be much better to scoop them out of the surface of a giant or supergiant star, where you don't have to fight gravity so damn much. 

If you mean human life I am a lot less optimistic than liljoshu. The problem is long term. There would be nowhere to go to escape the gravity. One's head is around 50 cm above one's heart. Double the gravity and to maintain normal brain blood pressure while standing you add another 50 cm of water pressure or about 37 mmHg. That takes a normal person to the threshold of hypertension just to stay conscious. Meanwhile the added pressure on his lower leg veins is about three times that. So in 2G the best you can hope for is a reduced life expectancy and huge problems with varicose veins. Then you have to consider pregnancy. Then you have to consider stumbling and the greatly increased force with which your upper body and head would hit the ground if you were human normal height. If you mean life evolved on such a planet, it will be appropriately adapted. The Giraffe and big dinosaurs show that Earth type life can deal with the blood pressure problem. Dwarfism shows that humans of normal intelligence do not need to be more than three feet tall. Bipeds on such a planet will be short and very stocky so that stumbling is not often fatal. The centaur body plan might work better but that may not be an evolutionary choice. The body plan of all vertebrates is that of a fish. If life always evolves in the oceans first, then the number of limbs is probably decided before adaptation to life on dry land starts. Edit: one other evolutionary thought. Here on Earth it was life in trees that created grasping hands with opposable thumbs. On a high G planet are trees possible and could anything bigger than a squirrel live in them? And if not, could intelligent technological life ever arise without those hands? 

Actually, you dont need THAT much to politically and economically collapse a nation with a single nuclear device. Take, for example, Manhattan during peak hours. How many people are there during that time, in a lethal range of a 40kt warhead? 1.5 million inhabitants alone (2010 census), and probably more if you include people that come to work there. Its also an important economical center of the US. Striking such point will generate millions of casualties that need rescue/care/support. Consider the effect that WTC had, where there were - comparably - very little immediate casualties. Add to that the fact, that you will be totally unable to provide even basic relief/support/health care to affected people. How many burn victims you will have? Several hundred thousands, very probably more. How many hospital beds does US have that can support the scale of injury that will be prevalent? Not enough. Can you provide transport ability / logistics to transport the casualties? You cannot. Not enough ambulances, and time. Not to mention area denial during first 2-3 days due to radiological effects. Social and political backslash would be enormous enough, not to mention any economic effects. Really, you do not need a prompt decapitating strike against whole of government for country to collapse into chaos. 

I'm afraid the short answer is that's it's probably impossible to tell unless you set up your new solar system and actually do N-body orbit integrations to see what happens over time. Things like eccentricity, obliquity (tilt), and precession variations can be chaotic (or not) depending on the orbits and masses of the planets. It's unlikely you'll have the same Milankovitch cycles we do now, because you've changed the interactions of the planets by changing their masses and orbits (changing their diameters makes no difference). For example, changes in the Earth's eccentricity currently depend primarily on the gravity of Jupiter and Saturn. Since you haven't changed the masses of those planets and have barely changed their orbits, their influence would be roughly the same... except that you've made both Venus and Mars several times as massive as the Earth, and since their orbits are much closer to Earth's than is Jupiter's, this probably would have an effect. (E.g., the gravitational force of Venus on Earth at closest approach is about half that of Jupiter's; in your new system, it's about three times stronger than Jupiter's.) It's a little hard to tell what you've done with the Moon: "has only 14% of Earth's gravity" -- does that mean its surface gravity is 14% of the Earth's (as compared with the current lunar surface gravity, which is 16.5% of the Earth's)? Assuming that plus the change in the Moon's size, your new Moon is actually almost twice as massive as the old one. Since it's further away, the change in the gravitational influence of the Moon almost cancels out. However, the tidal effects will be a little different: crudely speaking, the new Moon's tidal effects will be about 75% as strong, making the Sun's influence relatively stronger. You could guess that the periods for the obliquity (tilt) and precession variations would be a little longer than they are now (since the general history over the past several hundred million years is for the periods to get longer as the Moon moves further out in its orbit) -- if everything else in the solar system were unchanged. 

This may be a bit of a tricksy answer, but the Earth's core probably is collapsing. Very very very slowly. For the definition of core that includes both the inner and outer core. The inner core is solid. The outer core is liquid. It is believed that the inner core is denser than the outer core, and that the outer core is slowly crystallising onto the inner core. Or at least, changing from a liquud to a solid phase. The core, overall, is therefore becoming more dense and is shrinking. It is very slow because it can only happen as fast as the heat released by the phase change can escape. It is a long way to the surface! The "probably" relates to uncertainty over the exact composition of the cores and the behaviour of what is mostly nickel-iron at the incredible pressure and temperature at which this solidification is happening. It is completely out of range of lab experiments, and we cannot obtain core samples. Effect of this "collapse" over human timescales at the planet's surface: none. A billion years from now, the planet will have become slightly smaller. 

You can't define locations in 3D space using only two numbers (e.g., one angle and one distance, as you've done). You seem to be thinking of the Galaxy as perfectly flat, which it isn't. Think about locations on the surface of the Earth, which is a 2D problem: we use two (angular) coordinates: longitude and latitude. You can think of this as an angle measured from the North Pole (that's longitude) plus a distance along that line (latitude). But if we want 3D locations on the surface of the Earth, then you can add something like altitude from sea level. If you want something Earth- or Sun-based, why not use the Galactic coordinate system plus a distance along the direction vector? 

The pull will be dependant on the star's mass, not density. As for gathering fuel, you'd need to work out heat protection first, and radiological protection second - any star is, after all, a thermonuclear reactor, technically speaking. Thus you get a large amount of ionizing radiation output, especially up close (as radiation exposure scales up/down with distance. Our sun (and any other star too, for that matter...) could very well kill us with radiation if we got too close without shielding) 

Yeah, its technically plausible. Of course, an exosuit will only support your body and limbs, leaving out the more serious problem: heart might be hard pressed to keep up with pumping needs. Unless you find a way to internally/externally supplement that (and other bodily internal functions, that might depend on gravity), you will run into problems. 

The colour of a complex organic molecule containing a metal atom is by no means completely determined by that metal. For example, chlorophyll is bright green. The metal it contains is magnesium. Solutions of magnesium salts are usually colourless. Or you might consider the gamut of colours that a nasty bruise goes through as it heals. These are all generated by Iron, as your body recycles it from blood and other tissues as the damage heals. Known here on Earth: certain obscure marine worms use Cobalt-based blood. It is (unsurprisingly?) deep blue. Some of the metals you mention are unlikely to be useful as part of an oxygen-transporting biomolecule. Obviously an alien biochemistry might throw up surprises and the metal or the colour might not necessarily be part of the oxygen transport mechanism. However, to be useful on that front you almost certainly need a metal which exhibits two (or more) oxidation states differing by one. You'll find these in the transition metals on your periodic table. Vanadium through Copper on the first row, and many of the corresponding elements on the two rows below. The element will need to be reasonably abundant, since an organism will need a fair amount of Iron or whatever it can use in place of Iron. Here on Earth the heavier elements in the second and third rows are relatively rare (and of course you get less atoms per gram). The only one which life has made essential use of, is Molybdenum. (A few bacteria use Tungsten but that's not widespread). 

Both RTGs, and ny kind of reactor is not realistic by far. RTGs, while light and not having many moving parts, are not radiologically safe to be around. Unless you understand "being around" as deploying it and having a no-go zone 200 meters wide around it, until it stops working by itself. While it is somewhat-useable on an unmanned space probe, or an automatic weather station in a polar area, its not feasible for any real use with people around. Reactors are a step above that. They need heavy shielding around them (the pressure vessel alone will NOT cut it enough), they need support infrastructure (turbines, steam dehumidifiers, 2 or 3 (VERY) high pressure coolant loops (of which first one is deadly to be around just like that, due to radiological hazard, and they need large amounts of water (all nuclear plants, sans literally ONE, in the worlds, have either a river, lake, or similar water source nearby). Furthermore, fuel. You cant just put a natural uranium ore or unenriched natural uranium into an RTG or reactor. Reactor grade fuel means 3-5% enrichment (you need an enrichment plant for that). This is the easy fuel. RTG's do not work on uranium - they use plutonium (highly purified, too! RTG plutonium fuel pellets relase realy obscene amounts of heat due to its high isotope purity and high activity), which is not found in nature unles you breed it (for which process, in turn, you need a specialised breeder reactor, and enrichment plant). All of which are high level of complexity, highly dangerous (radiation, chemicals used) heavy industries. 

Engineering-wise, the question on the size limit has a lot in common with the limitation on the weight of an aircraft. You have to consider the strength of available materials, when subjected to forces that attempt to bend or buckle them. As the length increases, it rapidly becomes impossible to make a sufficiently rigid wing (aircraft) or mast (sail). I don't know what this limit translates to for a ship, which can have quite a few sails along its length. For an aircraft, the existing heavy military transports are pretty close to the limit. A kite provides an exception, because it is built of fabric and cables, all of which are in tension. Nothing rigid to be broken or buckled. Same advantage as a suspension bridge over any rigid bridge.
