Your style of riding may dictate that an full-suspension is appropriate, so the best thing to do would be to describe how you want to ride to the professionals at your local bike shop and listen to their advice. I have an admitted bias toward hardtails (and even fully rigid bikes). I've been riding a long time (since before mountain bikes existed...), and don't really ride anything seriously aggressive off-road (but I have ridden a lot of Utah Red Rock Desert). I've tried several full-suspension bikes, but for my type and style of riding I've not been convinced that the added cost to get to a similar weight/component mix was worth it. 

In my experience disc break squeal is typically a result of excessive vibration caused by one of three things: 

It's likely that helmets available online and for the UK market will carry one of the US certifications as well as a similar EU certification. I know there is a "CE" certification but I don't know about what it entails. Any helmet meeting one of those certifications will provide the basic level of protection you are looking for, even if it is just $15-$20 US. Beyond that comes the world of look, style and performance. As helmets increase in price, they decrease in weight, increase in vents, and sometimes increase in adjustability. I know you mention that you want to buy online, but you may want to purchase your first one at your local shop for the following reasons. 

In general you can get an very good all-around road bike, or a very good all-around mountain bike. To get a single bike for everything there will always be trade-offs in areas like weight/durability; speed/traction; etc. That said - many people own one bike and use it for everything. If I had to drop to one bike I would buy a 29"-wheel based front suspension mountain bike with the following: 

There are bearing races on either side of the hub, and in my experience there is not nearly as much space between the bearings as your picture shows. Having replaced several axles in older hubs, it always seems as soon as you pull the axle out the bearings fall into the inner space of the hub. The two bearings you can see are likely from this kind of problem. Remove all the bearings, clean and grease the races. Clean the bearings and replace them. Most of the time they are the same size on both sides but you will want to make sure. When you replace them there should only be a little bit of play/space between them. It's normally obvious if you've tried to put too many bearings on one side. 

Seems to me that your best option is choice 2: Signal to the left in advance of running out of the lane, check for a reasonable gap in the cars while still moving, and merge into that gap once you've determined that it's safe. In that option you are essentially behaving like exactly what you are - a slow moving vehicle. Your behavior is like what you would expect if you were operating a tractor, or a horse-drawn carriage. You operate in the lane when neccessary, move over to the right to allow others to pass when safe and convenient, and carefully merge back into the traffic lane when the shoulder is no longer safe. While doing this you want to avoid weaving in and out of traffic every few feet. This is also similar and predictable behavior much like what you need to do when the shoulder runs out as a right-turn only lane blocks your path. Option 1 is unsatisfactory because you lose momentum and will have a difficult time merging. Option 3 is a poor choice, not from the issue of passing cars on the right (which while legal in many areas, is dangerous), but because it's rude and then forces cars to pass you later - playing leapfrog. Option 4 is a possibility, but then again, think about operating a 'slow moving vehicle.' If you are consistently the same speed as motorists, you may stay in the lane, particularly if the shoulder is unsafe, otherwise, move over and let them pass. Option 5 is the poorest choice. You may be able to cross against the light safely, but not only is it risky, it makes you a poor ambassador of cycling, causing motorists to be angry at other cyclist, and frequently puts you back in the leapfrog situation. Plus, you could get a ticket, at least in my town. 

Pull your cranks laterally. Do they move? Remove the chain from the chainrings and give your cranks a good spin; listen for any unusual grinding noise or little clicks. Hold the down tube or seat tube while spinning the crank and see if you can feel grinding or vibration through the frame. 

You cannot outride (or outrun or out-any-other-exercise) a bad diet. On top of that, decades of research shows it's impossible to "spot-reduce". Your options are: 

I can't speak about HRM's that do not use a chest strap as that's the only type that I have used (other than to play with in the store). I find the ones with a chest strap to be completely hassle free, and I don't have to contort into a weird position to get a reading. I've had great luck with HRM's from Timex and Nashbar in the $50 range, and like Polar but have never owned one. If you do go with a chest strap type, the primary thing to watch out for in the lower-end range is the ability to change the strap battery. Some have a sealed chest strap, so you either have to tear it apart and super-glue it back together, or replace the strap entirely. 

Besides talking to individuals in your local bike shops, you can look for 'recreational' or 'touring' clubs. A Google Search for Bicycle Touring Clubs turns up clubs like our club in Utah, Bonneville Cycling Club (formerly the Bonneville Bicycle Touring Club). Larger recreational or touring clubs will usually rate their group rides by a couple of measures like distance and average speed, and will sometimes classify rides as drop/no drop (meaning that in a 'no drop', the group slows to the speed of the slowest rider). Pick the slower and shorter rides to begin with, and be prepared to be fully self-supported. I would welcome riders with a trailer or trail-a-bike on most of my recreational rides, but it can be frustrating if those riders really can't hang with the regulars. Finally - try to preview the group's route if possible. Most recreational group rides stick to quieter roads with wide shoulders, but you need to be aware that with the trailer you will be much harder to pass. 

While I strongly recommend coming to a complete stop, I would think that standing on your pedal and extending the other leg out behind you to cross over would be safer. In the cross-in-front alternative, your pedal foot is stuck behind the leg that hits the ground and I would expect there to be a significant risk of getting tangled up while in this 'grapevine' position and tripping.
