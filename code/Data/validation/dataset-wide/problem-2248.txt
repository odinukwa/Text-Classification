He will therefore not be allowed to keep wearing keeping pads and gloves in his new position. Mike Brearley once placed the keeper David Bairstow on the boundary for the final ball of the innings, when the opposition needed three runs off the last delivery. 

While the techniques of badminton are unlikely to be directly transferable to cricket, nevertheless virtually any sport that improves hand-eye coordination will have a positive impact on one's cricket, particularly one's batting and fielding. The great English batsman Colin Cowdrey reputedly used to warm up for batting by playing the game of rackets. The young Don Bradman hit a golf ball against a wall with a stick. All such exercise is beneficial. If anything, I would expect a player of racket sports to be more immediately comfortable with square-bat shots (the cut and the pull), and to require more training in straight-bat shots (particularly the drives). If you are a beginner, I would advise against solely focussing your efforts on one discipline. By all means start with batting, since you have experience in a racket sport; however, you may also find you have ability as a bowler. The more "strings to your bow", the better! 

I would definitely go for a slightly slower first half. I tried once to keep a high steady pace throughout the whole race and it didn't work well (Copenhagen 2010). I think the psychological effect is huge. When you decide to kick in your slightly faster pace, you start to advance slowly and that helps bigtime on motivation. The opposite, to see people start to run faster than you, because you have started a bit fast and maybe started in the wrong pacegroup at the startline, that will kill you mentally. 

If you run 10km++ you can focus on three kinds of running: Intervals Do 1 minute at a high pace (70% of max?) and then 30 secs of slow running. Then, increase your high pace with 0.2kmh. Do this until you fall off the threadmill. The session should be 30 minutes so don't start off with too high pace. Lactate threshold Longer runs with variations in pace just over and just under your lactate threshold pace. Let's say 10 minutes on each. Your lactate threshold should be around your half marathon pace, maybe a 25km run. And then your two paces should be 0.7kmh over and under this pace. This is very important for pushing your threshold. Long easy runs Just relax on these sessions but make sure they are at least 90 minutes 

In the scenarios you outline, the contact, and any obstruction, is unintentional, and therefore there would be no penalty or dismissal (other than the catch, if it was made). 

Assuming that the ball knocked one or more bails off, then provided no-one on the fielding side touched the ball before it hit the stumps, the batsman would be out Bowled under Law 30.1 parts (a) and (b): 

There is no Law of Cricket that specifically requires the use of shoes. (I am reminded of Mark Jefferson's fictional West Indian cricketer Hurricane Hamish, who found it impossible to bowl in shoes!) 

While this could, in theory, apply to stumpings, for instance if a batsman was a long way out of his/her crease and dives to get back, it would not apply to simply raising a foot off the ground whilst standing at the wicket, since the Law specifies that the batsman must be "running or diving". 

The problem with bowling is that there are so many things to think about, especially as a beginner. With absolute beginners, I attempt to make it as simple as possible. 

It must be possible to use the scoring tables for beginners, juniors and top athletes as well. There will be a special scoring table for men and another table for women. All the new versions of the scoring tables should be based on the statistical data for the combined events by paying due regard to the statistical data for performances by single event athletes. The new tables should be applicable now and for the future. It is desirable without creating other problems, that the total scores using the new tables for the top world class athletes should remain approximately the same. That is about 8500 points for the decathlon and about 6500 points for the heptathlon. As far as possible the new tables must insure that a specialist in one event cannot overcome performances in the other events. 

Wikipedia offers a pretty good list for this: $URL$ Football was added 1900. Rugby sevens will be added 2016. A list of team sports can be found in the list on wikipedia. Team sports in 2012 olympics were volleyball, football, badminton, basketball and handball. Cricket was in the olympics in 1900 only and there is no info when it will be added again. IOC decides. 

Good question. A common mistake is to select a bat that is too big for a young player. The temptation may be to buy a large bat for the player to "grow into", to save money as much as anything else, but it's definitely not a good idea. The bat should feel comfortable to and manoeuvrable by the player. Bob Woolmer's Art and Science of Cricket has this to say on choosing a bat for a young player (p.101): 

Law 24 (No ball) prohibits underarm bowling except by special arrangement, as your findings indicate. If the captains were to agree to underarm bowling, I don't see how it could be considered deceptive, since it has been specifically highlighted and therefore is unlikely to cause any surprise, especially since you would have to inform the umpire and batsman when you are going to do so. It would not be a sustainable long-term strategy as I would not think captains likely to agree to underarm bowling (it was used in an infamous incident in a 1981 one-day match between Australia and New Zealand). Coincidentally, I was playing cricket yesterday and one (new) player did end up bowling underarm; it was a social match and we did not object, but in future it will be necessary for him to learn to bowl overarm. Finally, without knowing the intricacies of fastpitch softball, I would be doubtful that underarm bowling in cricket would do anything other than provide an easy hit to the batsman. The renowned England captain Mike Brearley would occasionally bowl underarm, but he was primarily a batsman, not a bowler; his was an attempt to try something new to unsettle the batsman. It didn't work: as far as I know, he never took a wicket with such an action! 

I have run several with traditional heel landings. Then I started experimenting with a more forefoot strike. In the beginning I did it all wrong and my legs was on the edge of getting a bone membran inflammation. But I didn't give up and now I feel I have a more natural forefoot strike. I am still stribing for better technique and I wonder at what pace should a typical forefoot strike be effective? I know that running slowly, like 10-11 kmh the forefoot strike feels a bit unnatural to me. When I run 15-16 kmh the forefoot strike comes natural to me now. But my marathon pace is around 12 kmh, and I don't know if I should go for a forefoot strike in that kind of race? 

I live in Norway and have completed 3 full marathons over the last 3 years: Oslo, Copenhagen and Berlin. Oslo was nothing special, except being close to my home and very little travel time. There lots of running in quiet streets with little entertainment along the way (I hear it's a bit better now, though). It's not that flat either. I had a good experience in Copenhagen. Much flatter than in Oslo. But I definitely felt the cobblestone along the river way up in my calves :/ (couple of kilometers of cobblestone) Lots of people everywhere, nice route, and lots of entertaining along the route. Berlin was much like Copenhagen, only bigger. More people, more entertainment. And Berlin is the race to compete if you want to set a record (and I did). Good, flat route. All in all, from personal experience I would recommend Berlin the most. And Copenhagen. Not Oslo. Personally I would love to compete in two specific races, New York and Great Wall. 

This suggests to my mind that you must move out of the way of your opponent if it is necessary to do so to allow them to play their shot. 

Along with the other examples already cited, an unusual incident occurred in 1975, when the 3rd Ashes Test at Headingley was abandoned as a draw due to an act of sabotage: before the fifth day's play, the pitch was dug up and damaged with oil by campaigners calling for the release of a convicted criminal. 

Yes, it would be out hit wicket under Law 35.1 (a). Law 28.1 indicates that the wicket can be put down by the ball, the bat, any part of the bat becoming detached, the striker's person, or "any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached." 

Personally, I would err on the side of caution and opt for a bat that is lighter rather than heavier. The last thing one wants is a bat that impedes the development of good technique. 

An umpire who is performing unacceptably poorly is therefore unlikely to remain on the Elite Panel, assuming there are better umpires waiting to be appointed.
