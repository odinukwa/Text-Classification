You're already describing the process. 4 months is nothing if you're looking for big changes. It takes years. 

Any exercise which increases blood circulation in general; cardio! Bicycling, swimming, sex, running/jogging, aerobics, wrestling, football, basketball... You get the point. Also, mental exercise. Try solving a Rubik's Cube. Do some puzzles like crossword or sudoku. Meditation is also very helpful for things like this. Cut down on any distinctively bad habits like smoking, as well as alcohol and caffeine intake. Eat more healthy foods. Most people know they should, but you in particular are noticing the results of being lazy about it. Eat more fruit! There's nothing special about circulation to the brain, other than the lack of it being more noticable. At least now you should have a very tangible motivation for doing something about it. 

Understanding the changes 45 days is absolutely nothing to worry about. As a rule of thumb, six months is about the time it takes for your body to reverse the effect of a pregnancy. Remember, it took nine months for the changes to happen in the first place. A lot of this is of course also subject to genetics. We're not all the same. Some women can regain their previous stature in a matter of weeks. Others take months. And months is the most common. Helping the process along There are lots of things you can do to help speed up the process of getting your figure back. 

Background My shoulders have some catching up to do, compared to the rest of my torso, and I'm set on doing more overhead presses to have my compound exercises geared towards defining shoulders more. However, I need some inspiration for shoulder isolation exercises. Question What are some isolation exercises that will facilitate building broader shoulders? My own mind goes straight to the front/side/rear deltoids, but I definitely feel like there are some other muscles that help build defined shoulders. If so, which muscles would that be, and how would I target them? 

We can only conclude that someone who doesn't even want it in the first place, will never accomplish it. As for your question, it's all about the diet Cardio > weightlifting, when it comes to losing weight. But even then, weight loss is primarily done in the kitchen. If you can't get your diet straight, then no matter how much you run or cycle, you won't lose any fat. In fact, you'll just gain more. 

Yes and yes. And no, there can be no more detailed answer, because there is no detail in the question. It's like asking "is bread ok?" 

Find an angle where you can do 10-15 repetitions. If you can do more than that, find something lower. With time, you'll be coming down onto the ground, doing regular pushups! 

There is no "best type" unless we know significantly more about you, and what you're trying to accomplish. Anything on the shelf in a store is approved by higher powers, and won't do you any immediate harm unless you're allergic or otherwise intolerant to one or more of the ingredients. 

Well, ask yourself this; how does it benefit a rugby player? Muscles are multi-purpose. Even if you train the muscles in one particular way, the muscles will be able to perform other movements too. Take bench press. When will you ever need the ability to lay on a completely flat surface, and press a completely symmetrical and balanced object up and down? Never. But you train the chest and triceps, and these muscles are used for all kinds of pressing movements. Now, consider the same concept, but with the muscles trained by dragging weights. It's what we call a functional exercise. It's a type of movement that mimics things we might need to do in daily life, and also, it covers so many muscle groups at the same time, that you get a LOT of training done with every set. When an exercise covers so many parts of the body, it not only builds a lot of muscle, but helps with developing balance, endurance, and the central nervous system. 

I think the idea of the challenge ruins the idea of the challenge. One of the points we try to hammer home, is that exercise breaks the muscle down, and then you build it back up stronger through eating well and resting well. I think you should be taking every other day off, and see how that goes. That way, you give your chest and triceps some time to recover, and get ready for the next time. EDIT: I knew this sounded familiar. Is doing push-ups every day healthy? Note also Dave Liepmann's answer, suggesting to not just workout two parts of your body, neglecting the rest. It tends to cause imbalances. 

What is the best practice as far as the thumb goes with respect to the bar? I normally have my thumb aligned with the rest of my fingers, but I often get asked why I don't wrap my thumb around the bar (and form a fist). They say it looks unsafe, but anyone who uses this grip knows that it feels as fine as the wrap. Besides, if the bar is rolling out of your hand, your thumb is laughably unsuited to stop it. But this, as we all know, is generally not an issue anyway. My reason is mostly comfort, as I haven't researched best practices. What do you do, and why? Bonus upvotes for sources, as always. 

Bending the spine forward is not harmful. But during a deadlift with rounded back (as discussed above), the erectors are either not working, or not strong enough to prevent the rounding. This means that all the weight you're holding is loaded on your spine instead of the spinal erectors. This, combined with the fact that your pelvis is holding the bottom of the spine in place, means that your spine is "breaking" rather than simply bending. It's important to note that the negative effects of this "breaking" isn't necessarily something that just snaps. Damage to the spine happens over time, and rounding the back is a sign that you're likely doing gradual damage to your spine. This is why you see some powerlifters lift with rounded backs a lot. They know that this isn't good, but they're willing to risk a little wear and tear for the glory of getting that huge PB and/or trophy. At some point, you just have to get that damn weight up. But don't let that mentality become a habit. Better safe than sorry. 

You should definitely try to learn it either way. If you find out at 160 degrees that your hip structure isn't allowing it, that's still an impressive range of motion, and the flexibilty provides synergy with other movements. P.S. I assumed you were asking about side-splits, and not front-splits. That would be a different answer. 

Any protein you get from meat and dairy. You are 14 years old and not fully developed, which means that if you are even semi-aware of what you eat, you'll reap huge benefits. Just eat what your parents serve you, and finish your vegetables! 

First off, don't place too much value in your identification as an ectomorph. It belongs to a very old, and debunked myth about somatotypes. Now, the point of creatine isn't to gain a permanent weight increase. The point of creatine is to improve muscle recovery between sets by increasing their susceptibility to water, and thus their durability and stamina. Another benefit of creatine is that you will likely experience increased energy levels during workouts, because of this recovery. What creatine does NOT do, is provide permanent gains. You take creatine to maximize your workouts, and make better gains while under the effect of it. Then, when you stop taking creatine, you muscles will still have made those gains. You will lose the water weight (which I think you're confusing with going back to your "old form"), but the gains you made are there, unless you stop training all together. As you probably know, meat and fish are the best sources of creatine, and even then, you'd have to get 500 grams per day to get the optimal amount of creatine. What you, as a vegetarian, should do, is get enough of the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine which are used in production of creatine. Some foods that are rich in glycene: Raw seaweed, spirulina, raw watercress, spinach, soy protein isolate, sesame seeds. Some foods that are rich in arginine: Peanuts, walnuts, coconuts, soybeans, chickpeas, oats. Some good sources for methionine: Brazil nuts, oats, sunflower seeds.
