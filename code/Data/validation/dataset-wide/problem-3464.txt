The key theoretical work, at least in the area of education, comes from Milton Friedman and his "Theory of School Choice". Important references are: 

The common feature is that the same factor of production (stock) is employed in more than one activity over a given period (flow). Is the measurement of capital and labour used in the standard "determinants of growth" studies based on the stock or flow approach? In other words, are capital and labour measured in terms of the flow of services that these factors produce, or in terms of the stock of factors available in an economy over time? It is clear to me that the latter approach is plagued with problems, and the former is clearly more accurate. My experience is that the use of stock is more common.

Another reason is that investment is more volatile than consumption. However, if investment is supported importantly by state-owned enterprises, this might not apply well to China, which by the way have not had a recession in decades). From a western perspective, high investment (and low consumption) contributes to a high trade balance surplus and therefore to a high current account surplus, which might be good for the central bank of China (accumulation of reserves) aiming to keep the Yuan relatively low to foster the competitiveness of the export sector, but is bad news for the rest of the world. The latter would benefit from higher consumption of the Chinese population (via Chinese imports and rest of the world's exports). The same story is told of Germany, which would help other countries (mainly European partners, because of same currency) by rebalancing its economy from exports toward more consumption. Additionally, note that some economists have blamed China (among others) for the Great Recession (e.g. here or here), partly because of their voracious reserve accumulation policies, a core element in the export-led Chinese development strategy. Thus, a more rebalanced global economy might be good for the world economy as a whole, decreasing the likelihood of another recession. 

In all these cases, the Gini will now be between 0 and 1. Is there a "preferred" or an "usual" method? (perhaps by multilateral organisations like IMF, OECD, etc) As a secondary question, is there an inequality index that is better poised to deal with negative income? 

The same document provides an example of a fiscal impulse for Spain. Table 1 (in page 9) provides a disaggregation of the different channels through which such stimulus impacts the economy. One of them is indirect taxation, which affects households' consumption. Therefore, using a price index like WPI, which removes indirect taxes, removes (part of) the effect of a fiscal impulse on the price index. 

Mathematical analysis First, we know that $\dfrac{d U(x)}{d x}>0$. Then, it is true that: $$ U(x_p + \pi)=E[U(x_p)] $$ $$ U(x_q + \phi)=E[U(x_q)] $$ where the term inside the parenthesis in the left-hand side are the certainty equivalent. The sign of $\pi$ and $\phi$ depend on the nature of the utility function. There are three cases: 

Judging from the reference you provide, this refers to whether the set $\Theta$ is ordered or not. For example, natural numbers or the alphabet are ordered sets. In the context of moral hazard problems, examples could be effort, or ability. Since this is a numerical variable, it is an ordered set. In the paper you mention, the phrase "one dimensional, ordered type..." is not found. However, the paper states that: 

to refer to changes in $D(P)$ induced by movements in the supply curve (this I normally do it by showing the "dynamics" in the graph, from the original equilibrium to the new equilibrium along the demand curve). 

As you are interested in very specific items, using an aggregate PPP measure like the ones provided by the World Bank (which are as aggregate as the GDP or private consumption), or the Big Mac index is not very good idea. This answer explains in some detail how PPPs are calculated ((the bottom line is that aggregate PPPs include a whole range of products; see here for more details). If you are interested in just a few products, or maybe a single product (steel), as one of your comments suggest, you have to look into a more dissagregate PPP. You can find it here. These PPPs are still quite aggregate (for example, in the Classification tab you can find the full list). In your case, you might be interested in the Gross Fixed Capital Formation: Construction index. See here for more details on what this index includes. Notice that this is still quite an aggregate measure of PPP. Another drawback is that this is only available for either 2011 or 2005. A final note is that you are normally one adjusts for PPP when the interest is in comparing cost of living or wellbeing across countries. Adjusting for PPP makes less sense when the comparison is for example about the cost of sourcing a material from different countries. Here, exchange rates is what you need, as this reflects the actual cost for firms of selling/buying a product in different markets. As you do not provide the context of your question, it is not possible to tell whether PPP is pertinent or not to you. 

In microeconomics it is common to model utility decision between consumption and leisure. The latter refers to the time of a day the individual is not producing goods himself (if a yeoman producer) or to sell his labour in the market (a waged labourer). The productivity of the individual will affect how much it can produce (and earn) per unit of time. Therefore, time is directly incorporated into the model via productivity, which then affects the balance between consumption and leisure an individual will choose. For example, consider a yeoman producer with the following utility function (yes, no Leontief, but makes the point): $$ U(C,1-L) = C + a(1-L) $$ where $L$ refers to the proportion of the day the individual is working ($L \in [0,1]$). He can produce with the following technology: $$ Y = bL^h $$ and consumes all what he produces: $$C = Y$$ Assuming the yeoman farmer is interested in maximising his utility, the unidimensional optimisation problem is: $$ \text{max}_{_L} U(L) = bL^h + a(1-L) $$ The first order condition is: $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d} L} = bhL^{h-1} - a = 0 $$ Thus, optimal proportion of time allocated to work is: $$ L^* = b^{\dfrac{1}{1-h}}\left(\frac{h}{a}\right)^{\dfrac{1}{1-h}} $$ Optimal consumption is: $$ C^* = b^{\dfrac{1}{1-h}}\left(\frac{h}{a}\right)^{\dfrac{h}{1-h}} $$ The effect of (labour) productivity on hours of work depending on the returns to scale of technology ($h$). You have that:
