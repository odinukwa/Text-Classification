You really can't. Even if you have complete manufacturer cooperation, and it's 100% virusproof, something will go wrong. I'm a software engineer by trade, and there are all kinds of unintended bugs in just about everything you use. Bad enough when your phone has an app crash because it's a leap year, but imagine what might happen if we forget an edge case in the benevolence program. Whoops, forgot to include information that some people need more food than others due to high metabolism. Someone starved to death. Whoops, forgot that in rare cases people can become allergic to light. The AI's attempt to help them get more Vitamin D killed someone. Whoops, forgot that allergies sometime develop at random in adults. John's Tuesday Peanut Butter Sandwich killed him. Given how little we understand about taking care of humans ourselves, as humans, and how quickly we can adapt to those situations naturally, it will be very difficult to give a benevolent AI that kind of response. In software development, one of the patterns we use is Try-Catch. If something has a risk of throwing an exception, we wrap it in special code that expects that exception, and then does something to handle it properly. People do try-catch institutionally without having to be told to. Notice Patient A's weight dropping significantly? Investigate it, and find out the real issue (could be the metabolism, or a tapeworm, or a thousand other things). Notice Patient B's skin reaction? Investigate it, find out the issue, and resolve it. Notice John's allergic reaction to peanut butter? Epi Pen to the rescue! We would need to either find a way to develop this kind of insight into an AI (which is very difficult simply because we don't understand how it works in humans) or handle every such scenario (which is unlikely). Heck, I can't even document every edge and use case in a fairly simple piece of software without missing a few. If we could, we wouldn't need QA, we could automate every test. As it is, QA's job is to think outside the box and break it. 

What if the pactite is actually just a hallucinogen? One that provides a consistent mental effect among human users? It activates a part of the brain that allows for a mild telepathy or group conciousness, and the brain translates this as a voice providing advice. Alternatively it allows for a higher thought pattern that the human mind interprets as a voice providing advice. Nothing spiritual about it, just a mind-altering drug. 

For real power, I would choose cockroaches. They are hard to kill, there are lots of them, and you can use an army of them to slowly rise to power over the world. Imagine if every gun aimed at you didn't work because a roach was in the clip instead of a bullet. Imagine if anyone who talked out against you was swarmed with roaches. Imagine if your followers never had to deal with cockroach infestations (but everyone else did). You could play it "evil guy who controls cockroaches" way or you could play it "Savior of Humanity from the cockroaches" way, but either way you win. For symbolism/cool factor: Dogs (assuming it also carried over into wolves for coolnesss). Man's best friend? No, more like THIS man's best friend. 

It is doubtful you will have a uniform weight on a particular boat that comes through your canal. Even the same ship on two trips will have different weights because of cargo, bilge, crew, and a lot of other factors. This leaves you with two options if you insist on the boat lift: Overengineering or pre-lift weighing. Weighing Other answers have gone into the specifics of how you'd obtain the weight of a vessel. The issue is that this takes time, and the longer it takes you to get a vessel through your canal the less money you are making, and the longer it takes to ship things. There's always the "just add weight to the counterweight bucket until it works" option, but that lengthens the time of the lift as well. Overengineering Overengineering is going to increase your construction costs, which is a big negative when you're trying to make money on your canal. It also would have bigger maintenance costs (as you have a bigger apparatus in general). You also have some major issues if you have a failure during a lift, which requires further overengineering of redundancies or accepting a certain level of risk. Locks The solution I would recommend to your canal owner is to just install a Lock in his canal. They have been used for millenia and the technology is not that complex (but the basic design can constantly be improved by technology. There's a reason we still build them). It circumvents your weight problem, because you just need to pump water in and let buoyancy take care of the rest. It also would be faster than a lift system requiring weighing beforehand (the drydock option requires more work than the lock in terms of pumping, and similar sized facilities), and is simpler and safer than the overengineered solution. Even if you have an intricate pump system, and you suffer a failure of some kind, you can always operate the lock "manually" by opening the gates individually to flood and drain the lock. Or, if that's not an option, your fail-safe is to release the lower lock and then your boats are just "stuck" on the lower level canal until it can be repaired (which is far preferable to the "worst case" scenario of the lift, which is a boat shattered upon the ground). 

Expanding on @Faulkner's wonderful answer: You send a ship that is half generational ship and half cold storage. You freeze your new colonists, with all the training and skills they need to do their work, but you have a support crew of medical professionals, mechanics, and everything else you need to keep them alive and the ship heading to its destination. This crew will be generational, and will likely never leave the ship again (extended zero-G is a bitch). This gives your mission some robustness, as failures of a ship system doesn't mean death for everyone, it means Billie in maintenance gets to do some real work. It also means you have a vessel ready to support the colony (since it will have to have good medical facilities and means of growing food) and it can even transport specimens back to earth much quicker than the new colony could build a return vessel. It could even be your first merchant vessel between the planets, and could continuously ferry goods and people between them. Heck, you could even set up a slingshot maneuver and just have it constantly orbit the new system's star and Sol, and never have to actually slow down. Mount a few ion engines on that sucker and eventually it'll get up to a pretty good clip. 

This is very similar to the problem I had in my time travelling stories. I came up with a solution that still has some kinks, but a version of it might work for you: Let's say your Traveler is from Universe A. He wants to change something in the past to improve that timestream for the better (killing Hitler, investing in Apple early on, expecting the Spanish Inquisition...whatever). He travels back to Universe A's past, and makes his change. This splits off a Parallel Universe, we'll call it Universe B, where the change exists. Now, our traveler can freely travel back to Universe A, where the change does not exist, or continue along in Universe B. Now, say there's a copy of our Traveler that comes into being in Universe B, and we'll call him Traveler B (retroactively referring to the first one as Traveler A). This Traveler decides to change something, goes back in time, and spawns Universe C. And so on and so forth. This creates a problem. In order to realize the effects of Time Travel, you have to be part of the new universe that is spawn off, so Time Travel is superfluous (except perhaps as a touristy thing). That's where merging comes in. In my particular universe, the various universes can exist in parallel because they occupy different areas of a fifth dimension (which is referred to as probability). So Universe A and Universe B occupy the same place in the four traditional dimensions, but different areas in the probability dimension. To secure any positive changes into a particular universe, a manipulation is done to bring the probabilities in line with one another and merge the alternate universes together (with a healthy dose of Plot-tonium). This has resulted in there being a "Utopian" universe that the Time Travelers are agents of, and are attempting to seed positive parallels that can be merged in safely and further improve the Utopia. To answer your question in this particular universe, home always exists and you can easily find it, as you are directly tied to your universe and any changes ultimately impact another (until a merge occurs). 

Specific to your answer, yes you could recall the bitcoin private key. If you deleted the private key from all devices you owned and removed any reference to it, you could, in theory, have the only copy of the private key stored in your head. However, that does you zero good, as in order to use it you would need to re-enter that private key into a management tool of some sort to transfer bitcoin to another account. However, you could also do this with things like swiss bank accounts. The downside to "hiding" money on the blockchain in bitcoin is that technically anyone can look up any balance of any address at any time. The upside is that your name and information aren't directly associated with the address. Also, the only thing that secures it is your private key, so if someone were to get ahold of it, your funds would not be secure (whereas most banks have some level of fraud prevention that would protect you, and the FDIC insures accounts to a certain level against the bank failing). Theoretically it is an NP-Complete problem to brute force find a particular private key associated with a given public key. However, drastic advancements in computing power or a flaw in the algorithm (unlikely at this point) could render bitcoin addresses vulnerable. 

Freezing is probably not as much of an issue as you might think. If there's sufficient moisture in the air to cause ice crystals to form, your servers are screwed anyway. If there's not that much moisture, you can try Alexander's suggestion of running everything to keep the systems "warm." If your leak is big enough that there's no atmosphere in the room, then traditional hard disk drives will cease to function. They typically rely on a layer of air to support their heads at the appropriate height (I'm not certain if NASA has a design that works differently, but Solid State Drives do not have this failure point, they are just more expensive currently). If the hole is very large, you might have to deal with radiation impacting your equipment. This could cause all kinds of fun failures (this is assuming that your servers weren't built with some kind of shielding, but the room itself was, which makes more sense if people were ever supposed to be in this room). 

I answered a similar question in what I hope is a thorough manner. However, you are asking something a little bit more specific, so let's go about stripping away some pieces: You are discarding any historic or emotional connection to a particular spot on Earth 2.0 (but I will touch back on that in a minute), and are looking for a place that would be beneficial for 5 million to 25 million people to live in (half your proposed population). The answer actually depends a lot on your technology. If you just grab modern day technology, and the apparatuses to produce it all, you're going to need a lot of people to support production of things (the world economy currently utilizes some crazy economies of scale to produce all the wonderful things you see at your local Blue-Mart). However, if you have this world as a "leisure" world and are providing technology and goods from another source (e.g. warp portal from Earth 1.0) your demands change significantly. Food Let's assume you aren't going to just portal in all your stuff, and have to make it, particularly your food, but we will give you the benefit of the doubt and say you have modern GMO technologies (to help adapt to any weird things that live on Earth 2.0). You'll need your capital to be near a source food to ensure you aren't wasting a lot of time and resources on transporting food. Some of the best concentrations of arable land on Earth 1.0 are in India and Eastern Europe. Each of these areas has their own problems, but India has torrential rain, making Eastern Europe a slightly better choice (though India has supported massive populations throughout history). Additionally, Europe provides ample opportunities for expansion, while India is bounded by mountains to the north and the ocean to the south. Both have navigable rivers. India is surrounded by a fault line, however, and may have higher than normal seismic activity. This could be useful (if you can harness geothermal energy in an efficient way) or detrimental (as earthquakes, tsunamis, and other things are more common there than in Eastern Europe). As a fun fact, the average American farmer with modern techniques feeds 155 people a year. Natural Resources Another consideration that is a moot point if you are just beaming everything over from Earth 1.0 is natural resources. The kinds of complicated things that go into a cell phone or tractor come from all over the world, with a varying degree of rarity. Glancing at a resource map shows that India is again a decent contender, as it has several kinds of resources, as is South Africa. Like with food, it may be important to place your capital near these resources. As to what is important to your society, that depends on your level of technology. Oil will always be important, if not for fuel then as a component to make stuff (plastics, for example). While competing over resources may not be much of an issue (with only 50m max people) availability and access may be critical to ensuring your industry is running well. Fresh Water Fresh water is another issue (also sidestepped if you just say desalinization is cheap and effective in your world). India and Eastern Europe have adequate access to fresh water tables for significant populations. Most places in the world, with modern technology, have sufficient water supplies "nearby" for a large population, the issue today is sharing it among 7.5 bn people. Obviously the middle of the Sahara is not a great place for a capital for that reason. Energy Here's another fun consideration. How are you generating power? If it is all nuclear, being somewhere near sources of Uranium is a good idea. If it is all solar, then around the equator is a good idea, as they get sun all year round. Geothermal? Well, places like Iceland that are built on geothermal hotspots are great. Historic Context I know you said nobody would have a connection to a place, but consider this: You are given a blank slate on a new world, what would you do? I'd visit some of the natural wonders and just stare in awe at them, perhaps comparing them to Earth 1.0. Some people may go to religious sites and see what they look like without all the humanity (others might try to recreate their religious sites on the new world. Consider, for example, how would a Muslim person pray on Earth 2.0? Would they pray towards where Mecca would be? Would they make a pilgrimage to the middle of nowhere?) Access Accessibility of an area is also important. This makes where your other population centers are important. For example, India might seem awesome in terms of arable land, water access, and other things, but if your other population centers are in Asia, then you have to put roads through high mountains or travel by sea to get there. Not very convenient. However, if you are in the middle of the United States (say, my home town of St. Louis) you have convenient waterways and easier routes to a variety of resources and climate types. Climate I think you want a temperate environment with a moderate amount of rain. It isn't the most comfortable to live in (steamy summers and snowy winters) but it is where much of the best food growing land is. Your capital can be isolated somewhere in a slightly different climate band, but it will still experience much of the weather swings as the farmland it is near. I'd avoid obvious things, like flood plains and tidal zones, and rely on some "terraforming" to improve the area (draining swamps to reduce bugs for example).
