Yours is a good question.. Here's a link that might help you, and another one that could be of some use. To be completely honest, this is something that I've seen a.) tackled by server admins and IT managers with the best of intentions yet yielding the worst results :) and b.) honestly better left up to HVAC/building engineering/facilities professionals who know the right questions to ask and what to think of. I do, of course realize that you may not have that option though. 

Which should give you a little help in setting up exactly what logfiles you wish to parse. In addition there's this corresponding entry, that details the "TO" and "FROM" dates: 

I would highly suggest checking the System, App and Security logs on the local 2K3 server, (provided it's your DC as well?) If it's NOT your DC, check on the local machines to see what DC they're authenticating against. Check the logs on the local machines too, that could shed some light on the issue. Were there any changes made on either the domain, or the local network the night previous? Any remote software deployed via central location such as Altiris, etc? Off the bat, not knowing your network I'd suggest that someone or something changed on your domain and possibly didn't fully replicate to your office there.. Or, went wrong entirely. Also, check replication, global catalog status, etc. If reboots are "bringing them back", it sounds like it might just be a case where your machines can't find the DC to authenticate against, etc.. Any more info or details about the domain/network setup you can share? 

I've got a pretty good one. Admittedly, it was prior to my time as a sysadmin, but still tech-related so I figured I'd add it. Back in the day, I was working as a satcom/wideband tech for the USAF. Having recently graduated technical school, I found myself stationed in South Korea. Shortly after arriving on-station an opportunity arose to travel down south with the "big guys" who'd been there for a while and actually work on some real-world,(i.e. `production') equipment. I went down with the crew and as an eager, young tech, was chomping at the bit, quite excited at the prospect of getting my hands on an actual piece of equipment that was passing LIVE military voice and data traffic. To start me off slowly, they handed me a manual, turned to the preventative maintenance section and pointed me in the direction of four racks filled with several large digital multiplexers. The equipment was easy enough, we'd covered the same equipment in tech school. First page of the manual read; "Apply power to the ditigal multiplexer. Turn both rear switches to the ON position and wait for the equipment to power-up, then begin tests." I looked up, and there was already power APPLIED! I was in a quandary for sure. Not knowing how to proceed, I shot my best, `Ummmm.. Kinda lost here' look at the senior. He looked over at me and laughed, "No, no, it's ok. You can ignore that part of the checklist." Then, as he noticed the look on my face, (since we were taught in school to NEVER, EVER ignore any part of a checklist, and it was certain death and destruction if one was to do so) he put a serious look on his face and said, "Ignore ONLY that part! Follow the rest of it, to the letter!" Dutifully, I ran through the multi-step PM instructions, happy as a clam and proud that they were letting such a low-ranking, (albeit smart) tech do this important work. Somewhere between the fifth and sixth preventative maintenance checklist on these huge multiplexers I started noticing an increased level of activity around me. Phones were ringing, people were moving quickly. Quizzical looks were being exchanged. Finally, a group of folks ran up to me, headed by one of the senior techs who had brought me down. "Hey! We're seeing HUGE outages in data traffic, and we've isolated/traced the path back to the racks that you're working on! Are you seeing any weird.." (At that point he was cut off by another one of the troubleshooters who'd made her way around to the first group of multiplexers that I had been performing the PMs on.) "HOLY NUTS! THEY'RE TURNED OFF! HE'S BEEN TURNING THEM OFF!!!!" In short order, I watched as they hurriedly ran through the first step in the manual, "Turn both rear switches to the ON position..." When the senior tech was done, he came over to me and incredulously asked what I was thinking of, by turning the critical pieces of equipment off. Scared out of my wits, I handed him the checklist that I'd been following, swearing that I hadn't deviated at ALL. That I had followed it, `to the letter' as he'd instructed. After a while he laughed and pointed out where the problem lay. In the manual, the FINAL step in the preventative maintenance checklist was: "Record final probe reading, wipe down front panel, removing all dust and particulate, then turn both rear power switches to the OFF position." :) 

(WTF? `Performing System Maintenance'? What system maintenance would that be, little service account?) The domain service account, (mydomain/altiris-server-account) is local admin on the box, and running the following Altiris services: Altiris Client Message Dispatcher Altiris Client Task Data Loader Altiris Deployment Server Data Manager Altiris Deployment Server DB Management Altiris eXpress Server Altiris NS Receiver Altiris Object Host Service Altiris PXE Manager Altiris Service ...as well as the following SQL services: MSSQLSERVER SQLSERVERAGENT I'm completely stymied. No scheduled tasks are performing any obvious reboots, nothing shows in displaying "at" on the local box.. Nothing else appears to be scheduled in an application, other than some Altiris stuff. 

Dude, I just thought of this after posting. Maybe this will help a little more, since most of the links to, "Here's how Bob did his config, and here's how Jerry did his here, which is nice and all, etc." are no longer valid. In the hopes that it can help you out a little more, here's my analog.cfg file: 

Symantec's "Altiris" will patch as well, and is a general all-round good management/inventory/ticket tracking system. That being said, we migrated from using Altiris to patch, to WSUS. WSUS can be configurable to impact your users in the least-disturbing method using it in conjunction with GPOs. 

I would agree with RainyRat, (that's an awesome username, BTW dude) and express my own incredulity with your anti-wireshark sentiments. (I also don't know of any security vulnerabilities in it either, and I use it quite a bit.) That being said, I'd love to know if there are any. In the interim, there's always LanHound 

They're far and few between, but they're out there. Trust me. And learn, baby, learn. Attach yourself to him or her, watch for the little stuff. How do they set up their workflow? What processes do they use? What command aliases do they use? Any that you can adapt for your use? 

Second time I've come across this question, and didn't see what I assumed might be a good answer for you, so lemme toss this out: How about an ftp site, (benefit of being OS independent, can be internal, etc.) Then you could lock down each student's folders/files in exactly that method? EDIT: Should you consider that solution, here's two links that might help you out: FTP mini how-to How to limit access to a ftp site in Windows Server 2003 SECOND EDIT, (I think this might be what you're looking for) How to set up a `blind-drop' ftp site 

We implemented Aerohive. Specifically because it met each of our requirements, a.) ultimately manageable by the helpdesk, b.) reliable security, and c.) good support. (Personally however, I would have opted for a Cisco wireless AP solution, but that's just me. :) 

I mean, it's being awfully nice about it and all. Each and every time it seems like it's a graceful shutdown. Windows 2003 R2 server. (SP2) HP Proliant DL380 G4. (BIOS current as of 2007.) Xeon dual-core proc (3.2 G) 4 GB RAM. Running: * Altiris NS and management server * SQL Server 2000 SE (SP4) * IIS According to the security and system log, a domain service account with local admin privs is rebooting the box, with this entry in the log. (It even gives a reason, that nice little account! :) (And not only that, but the only other account that's logged in/connected happens to.. ahem, be my admin account.) 

Suggestions: 1.) Try commenting out/removing the "guest ok" statement. 2.) Try removing/tweaking the veto files statement, (for no other reason that I've had some issues with that myself.) Actually, here's a working line from one of my smb.conf's, (several users on that machine, all co-workers of each other.) [username] comment = Username home share path = /home/username writeable = yes invalid users = None valid users = username, co-worker1, co-worker2, co-worker3, co-worker4 veto files = /.ra/.ram/.wmv/.avi/.mpg/.mpeg/.mp3/.oog/.wav/.mid/.aac/.mov/*.wma/ browseable = yes Maybe that will help? 

1.) Most fun naming convention for me, mathematicians and physicists. The list of notable ones is almost endless and they're pretty distinctive, "Dirac", "Fermi", "Pauli", "Feynman", etc. 2.) Here's one that might work for you: First character: W, S or L, (Workstation, Server or Laptop) Second string: office/branch accounting code such as 047, 130, 227, etc. Third string: OS designator, (RHL, SUN, XP, VI, 2K, 2K3) Fourth: (here's where it splits and gets weird.) If it's a server, then a VERY short purpose code. (For application servers: "app01", etc. DNS, mail, file, etc. If it's a workstation, then put in the last four digits of the user's extension. So we've got: Sun Solaris application server, located in Dillion, Colorado which uses the office accounting code "244": s244sunapp01 Windows XP laptop, assigned to marketing personnel located in Anchorage, AL (office code 047) at extension x4556: L047xp4556 Windows 2003 domain controller, located in Bellingham, WA (office code 012): s0122k3dc01 ...and so on, and so on. Worst naming convention I ever saw used was truncating the username in a workstation name, which led to ALL SORTS of weirdness. 

A very quick and dirty method/suggestion: Set each suspected account's password to expire and require reset upon next login. Place an asterisk in the description field of each account. Wait a week or so, re-check your flagged accounts to see which ones still need the password reset. Disable the offenders, wait for helpdesk calls, re-enable the ones that were on vacation. Another one: Alternately you could also send a list of suspected users to your HR/personnel department and see if any of them will verify that they are in fact, still employed. One more: Finally, I believe that if you open "Active Directory Users and Computers" and expand the AD Query tool, you can create a query that details what you're looking for. 

Of course you should care. After all, any job worth doing is a job worth doing well. 1.) It's already been said but it needs repeating for reiteration. Document, document, document. Use excel spreadsheets, notepaper, quill and parchment if you have to. Several thousand mead notebooks like in the movie "Se7en" if need be. Either way, lay it out clear, concise and easy-to-read for whomever is going to have to replace you when you get hit by a meteor. 2.) Once you've begun documenting everything, you should be in the writing mood. Time to start a side project detailing the last few years' changes made on the servers. Start building a change-management process, but go through it historically. Make sure you note how often you've changed those disks on some of those finicky servers. How much they cost, etc. These provide great metrics for you to rely on anyway, even if that meteor misses you and takes out the neighbor's dog instead. 3.) Implement a monitoring system that monitors and emails critical failures. What's that, you say? You have one already? Sweet! Now document it. How it works, what you monitor, why you monitor it. 4.) You've got a responsibility to take it to your management types again. And again, and again. As many times as you can. Be polite. Be respectful, but come bearing what the cost to the business would be, if that meteor came down and you disappeared. This is not a responsibility that you can blow off, it's an ethical requirement of your job and comisserate to the position you hold as the proverbial `keeper and guardian of the keys to the kingdom'. Think of it this way. If you can avoid and forget worriyng about this and feel OK doing that, then why aren't you combing the accounting fileshares for company salaries to see what and how much more those management types are making than you. Why aren't you exploiting confidential corporate data for your own use? Why aren't you reading people's email? Simply put, (and hopefully) you aren't doing these things because of a good solid sense of morals and ethics. You know, the whole right from wrong sort of thing. Thus follows, if you have that, then you know that it's clearly your responsibility to document and prepare countermeasures against the worst-case scenerio. That being, your uninterrupted-by-work and relaxing vacation trip to Hawaii. :) (Sans meteor, that is.) 

Hmm. We've seen somewhat similar issues here, but outside of a few high-end plotters that we print directly to IP for, we're hosting the rest of them off of a printserver, and your symptoms are not exactly the same as what we've seen, but close enough. I've got a few ideas for you, in the hopes that they'll help but nothing really conclusive :) 

[An extra added benefit is that since you're working with one mesh account, you can add a bunch of devices and replicate the folders between them. Let's say you've got 3 or 4 execs, if they want, you can have "John Brown's" folder replicate to "Jane Smith's" desktop and vice-versa, or everyone's folder replicated to "Mister President and CEO's" desktop.] Here's the link. Again, it's beta but might be a good interim solution, etc. 

If this is a temporary solution you need, and don't have the time/inclination to set up a VPN, Webex is pretty good. You can check it out, here 

Reading your comment you say that your clients can't see the domain controller, that's a HUGE problem there. They need to be able to see it. Check your SRV records in DNS, and/or on the local node check what the machine/logon sees as the DC. (You can do that by opening a command prompt, typing "set" and dumping the env variables and looking for something that looks like this: 

Since this is subjective, I thought that I'd just toss out the ones that help me the most. All of `em can be found elsewhere, cribbed from "How to do better at time management!" articles, etc. They're just what help me. They may not necessarily help YOU. i.e. Your Mileage May Vary. Also, while they're not necessarily a direct and succinct answer to the question at hand, I believe that when used, they contribute overall to improving time-management, which has the direct overall effect of helping me free up some time, to complete those important-yet-not-urgent-tasks. 

Some links that may help: Saving data from broken opensuse partition Here's a pdf that could be good. and, a ubuntu forum post that has a lot of links inside that might point you in the right direction. HTH..

Prior to forcing master browser, (I'm not 100% behind the idea that's the problem, but you know your network best) check it first with the support tools "browstat" 

3.) If you use HP in a large corporate setting and have a vendor agreement or something set up with them, check into HP StorageWorks Storage Mirroring, however it's a bit heavy-handed for two windows folders. 4.) Finally, there's also, (beta warning! Beta warning!) Windows Live Mesh, but it's.. You know, beta. :) Personally, I'd go with the robocopy option. 

There's a few ways to do this; 1.) DFS folder replication will work, there's a tutorial here and here's the MS webpage. 2.) Robocopy in mirroring mode will work as well, but it won't key off the fact that a file has changed. Here's a script that I shamelessly copied from somewhere, (why re-invent the wheel, eh? :) that I used when migrating large amounts of data from one share to another. (A big bonus with this is that it will do incremental mirroring, i.e. run it once to replicate, then run it again and it will only copy over the files that have changed. Script is: 

Here's an add-on that might help: "Open in browser" And here's a KB article that also might help, "MimeTypes" 

Sorry, that last little bit in there is if you've got reportmagic installed and running as well. If you don't, I HIGHLY recomend it. Makes analog pretty, impresses management. Mmm, Mmmm good. Like soup or something. :) That being said, I'm going to guess that you're wanting to restrict analyzing to a week because it's taking forever for analog to parse your logs. (This is a totally random guess, and colored by my opinion, because I sorta/kinda saw the same thing when initially setting it up :) Be advised, once you parse a set of logfiles, (say a few days worth, or a week's worth) it may take a while, however re-running analog to examine any following logfiles is extremely quick. To summarize; create a scheduled task for analog to run once a day and it while the initial run will take some time, each successive run will be much faster than the first. HTH, mate...
