Give them a super good river You're a benevolent God, so give your people a nice, reliable, tamable river. I'm not sure what is irrigating your farmlands, but I'm going to argue that a river naturally will get people to move and explore. 

This means, that as people spread out along the river and travel up and down it and more importantly down the river, you're eventually going to end up at a sea or lake or ocean. Then, everything that made the river so appealing to follow will be cranked up to overdrive as people move up and down the shore in both directions, and eventually people would be so interested in what is beyond the sea/lake/ocean that they build big honking ships to go and try to see what's on the other side. If this whole scenario super plausible that's because this is exactly how early civilizations evolved and expanded. 

Servals are solitary creatures that are highly territorial. Usually that means they make poor targets for human hunting companions (they much prefer to hunt on their own). Contrast this with dogs, who were most likely bred from wolves, who are pack animals. Check out this video for explanations on traits that make animals more domesticable. Servals have a short lifespan (compared to humans), reach maturity fairly quickly, and are fairly intelligent (all traits that are helpful with domestication). There is no reason why they wouldn't be useful in vermin patrol, setting up shop near fields and grain stores to protect them from being eaten by rodents. That's how modern cats were domesticated. This means that servals are probably able to be domesticated but would not do well as a hunting companion. 

Clouds Different types of clouds sit on different layers based on altitude, air pressure, and relative humidity. You mentioned your atmosphere has breathable air, does it also have water vapor in the atmosphere? Are there rain clouds? Methane clouds? Sulfur Dioxide clouds? Maybe an enterprising character notices that the moisture collectors are collecting more methane than before, or that when they head into a storm cloud, they get more violent turbulence than before. Depending on how far up they are, maybe they are used to riding out some of the more violent storms that happened lower in the atmosphere, but the protagonists have a rude awakening when a storm that they previously wouldn't have paid mind to 10 years ago tragically destroys their town. 

Perhaps the Church provides the alcohol for free to anyone who wants it (reducing the likelihood of home brewers). If this is not an option, then make the "wild yeasts" in the area produce bad flavors or heavy toxins if used. The Church has access to other yeasts that they use for their processing that provides the best beer. You could even tie alcohol (and any other mind influencing substances) to religious experiences. Maybe the only time your people drink is during ritual ceremonies and to become closer to the Gods. Your religious organization could even make it their dogma that spirits produced without the blessing of the Church are tainted and will lead a soul to damnation (adding in the fact that local wild yeasts are poisonous or foul tasting will reinforce this). 

The best chance we have to survive an AI apocalypse is to be useful to the AI in unique way. Human pattern recognition and creativity are two strengths that are hard to replicate exactly in an AI. These are reasons they might keep us around. We could also use this to our advantage, assuming that we make AIs that are completely logical, then keeping a small amount of humans that have been rendered sufficiently docile for the purposes of their unique viewpoint and creativity might be worth the cost associated with it. 

The change overwrites the current "time." The changes are part of history and always have been. This would corrupt/overwrite whatever checking mechanism you can device that is within the same timeline. The plus side is that the Empire can honestly say that they have not detected any corruption to the timeline. The change splits off a parallel universe. People of Universe A maintain their original timeline, but Universe B has the new timeline. These sorts of changes could be detected, and, assuming that you can cross into a new parallel dimension, could be "eradicated" by destroying the parallel universe. The original timeline would remain safe (though, in theory, if there was a Universe B version of the Temporal Inquisition, they would believe they were the originators and try to destroy Universe A in a similar way). The change causes a "shockwave" that slowly changes the current Timeline to the new Timeline. This could be detectable by scanning historic events and comparing them to a database. It will also create dramatic tension, as once the "shockwave" reaches the current timeline, it will overwrite the current timeline. 

A river will also make people move downstream, eventually leading people to an ocean, lake, or sea. Here are some reasons why: Floods There will naturally be periods of heavy rainfall, and since lots of people have their houses built on the river (some of them perhaps less well off than others), naturally some of these buildings would be swept away in floods. Since floods cause things to go, you know, downstream, plenty of people will have reasons to go downstream to go look for their loved ones or to try to recover valuables that have been washed away. You don't need floods either, plenty of people might fall in the river after a night of drinking or have boats capsize, for people to want to look downstream. Curiosity This is the biggest one. Once it's super easy to go downstream (just get in a raft and go!) people would want to. Some of them might be thieves who want to avoid the law. Some of them would hear about vast treasures to be had downstream. The river, cutting itself through the vast landscape, would be an inescapable lure, pointing itself down and out, away from everything you've ever known and giving you a path to follow into the unknown. 

A river will make people want to spread out, gradually extending out the civilization and causing them to build towns and hamlets farther and farther away from the main city. Here's some reasons why: Fish Fish are a great source of protein. Fish guts are a great source of nitrates which can improve crop yields or reduce the amount of time a field must lie fallow between usages. Fishers would gradually spread out over the length of the river to try to find different pockets of fish or just to go upstream of a popular spot that is being overfished. Farmland A good river deposits nutrient-rich silt and irrigates the landscape, meaning that all up and down its banks would be super fertile, especially compared to the surrounding landscape. Nearby animals would come and graze on the grass growing near the river, as well as drink there, meaning the river banks would become great spots for hunting, too. Any enterprising farmer would want to settle away from the rest of the other farms to try to get more good land to till. Washing, Water and Waste I assume your city has people who wear clothes, get thirsty, and use the bathroom. The river will naturally be a super convenient place to dump your trash and, you know, take a dump. I'm sure some of your more well off citizens would want upstream water so that it doesn't taste so... earthy, or to wash their clothes where they know their neighbors don't dump their garbage. This means that more downstream city folks might find themselves more vulnerable to cholera, or in general get a dirtier river, causing more wealthier folks to try to move upstream. Trade Eventually, people in the one area of the city are going to realize it's really easy to move heavy objects if you put them on a raft than dragging it along by yourself. This will mean there will be warehouses and markets on the banks of the river. Merchants will associate the river with more trade and more wealth. People will build up their houses around these markets, and then it comes to pass that the only way to really expand your business is to build up more river docks. This and the waste problem will cause people to: Riverfront Spreading It's a treat to be able to have riverfront property. The views are nicer, you get better breezes, quicker access to water, your own little private quay. People will grab property on the riverfront, and as your city develops, more and more people will have to build farther and farther up and down the river to grab that good riverfront property. 

As far as I can tell, this is minimum ratio of oxygen to CO2 in which humans and (all?) animals can safely live. What would be the meteorological, biological or physical implications of living in this sort of atmosphere? 

So from what understand they want the most militarized weapons, but also the easiest to hide --which is contradictory. I think what you are looking for is some sort of collapsible semi automatic long gun, It would probably have a stock which is folding, extendable or detachable, the barrel would have to screwed on (or assembled in some other means) perhaps be in two or three parts when carried, and the clip would kept in a separate place on the body (probably the boot and one clip in each). Maybe even a detachable grip. Thus the largest part of the gun is the the trigger apparatus So the gun would take some time to assemble, at least 30 seconds. That's not so much a problem though (could even provide some great story suspense that actually meakes sense). If you make it a 22 caliber rifle say (which would be all you need), you could get the individual parts down to size of about an adults man's hand and have say a trigger and chamber, folding flat stock, grip (that maybe expands from the width of finger to two or three inches long (still the height of a finger, a barrel that probably collapses into two three pieces like a blind man's cane, and the magazine(s). Hide the trigger/chamber in the small of the back, magazines in one boot, barrel in the other, grip probably in the sleeve and the leaves the very thin collapsible folding stock probably under an armored Kevlar breastplate 

If you want to look at why this happens in the real world, it's resource extraction. You see this in the European era of colonial (a lot), but even in modern times with powerful countries such as the United States backing regimes they don't necessarily like (such as Saudi Arabian Royal Family), against their rivals in the region because Saudi Arabia ensures them access to oil. Similar dynamics played out in Colonial India, in the "New World" with native tribes, in Africa (are playing out even today in Africa). Why does this happen? I mean, if the Aliens are more powerful, why not just wipe out humans to get to their resources? Well the United States Armed Forces definitely have the capability to wipe out every country in the Middle East and "take the oil." There are several reasons we don't. The biggest is probably that public opinion just wouldn't support it. Nobody in an educated and open society (or at least very few people) want genocide and or national piracy openly committed in their name. LONG SIDE NOTE: You could argue that in war time it would be accepted, or even in the wake of a 9/11 scale terrorist attack, but the world is too globalized now, too instant, too visible. What kind of support would the "moral bombings" of WWII had had if there videos in full color of charred bodies streaming live on youtube at the time. But anyway, unless humans attack your aliens, this whole side note is a mute point. The next more cynical reason is that dead men make terrible laborers. It's just a more efficient use of resources coerce or pay people to work than kill them, and if they are trying to kill each other... well backing one side is an excellent way to get them to work for you under threat of annihilation without actually having to even threaten to annihilate anyone yourself. The believability of this really depends on the aliens themselves. If they are James Cameron Alien type monsters or Invasion of the Body Snatchers single mind ends just means no regrets type aliens, it falls apart. However, if Alien society resembles our own with shifting political dynamics, value of individual life and limited resources: totally believable. Becky Chamber's novel "The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet" (which I'd recommend as fun read) actually revolves around this very dynamic. A powerful Galactic inter-species Federation(? forget exact term she uses for governing body) admits a faction of a new race into the federation (which gives this faction a defensive treaty) even though they are at war with other factions of their own species to gain access to resources within this species' territory. As far as which side the Aliens choose to back: it's either going to be which side the higher ups perceive as being in a better position to begin with (nobody wants to back a loser); which is more willing to work with the aliens, or aliens think would be more dependable to work with; which is percieved as the good side in the realm of alien public opinion... probably some combination of the three. 

Doing some back of the envelope math, 4800 km/hr is equivalent to 1333.333 m/s. This makes it a High Velocity (but not Hypervelocity) round. This means in terms of physics, it is not outside the realm of possibility. Based on statistics of the Browning Machine Gun Rounds, it's muzzle velocity with some ammunition (647 gr (42 g) Speer) is 928 m/s. Let's assume that everything else constant, your bullet will be about twice as powerful(see note at the end) than this round. The BMG rounds have some pretty serious stopping power (given that the BMG was originally intended as an armored car/tank killer), so what you are going to have with your round is something that can penetrate better. I like the example of the Barret M82 a 50 cal sniper rifle using these rounds. This gun has been reported to regularly punch through unreinforced walls and kill those on the other side. Basically, your improved round is nothing more than more of a "bunker buster" than the BMG. Probably getting through unreinforced walls (and maybe even creating shrapnel from those it doesn't fully penetrate. I would hate to be in a wooden room hit by these). I will also point out that the Barret M82 is capable of shooting through people. (it also has the distinction of holding the record for the longest sniper kill among US Service men, beaten out by two Canadian records by the McMillan Tac-50, another BMG rifle, and one by the AWM 338, which uses a NATO .338 round). As to what it would do to a person....someone without body armor would be chunky salsa to a BMG round, so at best your better round would just spread damage a little more (so if hit in the head, a little less of the lower jaw/neck would still be attached, the chunks would be less recognizable as human, etc). Against someone with body armor, more of the damage would be inflicted on the body (most rifle rounds can penetrate basic body armor, and the BMG definitely can as it can go through walls and doors). Your better round is just more capable of penetration and would do more damage to a person. NOTE ON POWER: Quick kinetic energy calculation, assuming the same mass of round, puts the new round at about 2.064 times the kinetic energy of the original, not 43% as I originally thought.
