It doesn't seem difficult to determine the appropriate nature of our mind-to-world intentional states. Their appropriate nature is that they match accurately and precisely to the world, perhaps maximally so (except where perhaps this doesn't infringe excessively on most others' privacy). It feels as if this is an obvious and undeniable logical definition. However, it seems much more difficult to determine the appropriate nature of our world-to-mind intentional states. Their appropriate nature is... what? While one good first answer might be that their appropriate nature is that they reflect end-states that already have well-defined routines for satisfying them, we know this answer comes up short. We regularly see people solve problems that at least in large part had no known well-defined routines for satisfying them. This meant that they posed a problem that hadn't been posed exactly like it before (or finally solved one that had been such an open problem). What exactly is the permissibilic mechanism for people to pose unique (previously unsatisfied) problems, unique world-to-mind intentional states? Sometimes people pose unique problems and other people like them for it, and sometimes people pose unique problems and other people hate them for it. Many people act as though they have a thoroughgoing familiarity of the permissibilic mechanism, that here too there's an obvious and undeniable logical definition in effect. But where's the manual – or what is it like – on the necessary and sufficient constraints on posing previously unsatisfied problems, on formulating previously unsatisfied world-to-mind intentional states? 

It can be done in one step. The first man sees two white hats and says that he knows. But, you say, the problem says that the first man says "I don't know"? Exactly. The problem's definition is also specified by the second man saying "I don't know." Therefore, if you can break the definition of the problem for your two steps, I can break the definition of the problem for my one step. ... 

Your question leads directly to 2 important considerations. First, whether the physical laws we discover through science are merely 'resemblances' - that they reflect but are not actual natural realities; and Second, that the laws of physics do reflect physical content or constituents themselves as it is like in nature. This in turn depends on your own metaphysical view of what is possible to be known by the human senses. The problem with the term 'Laws of Nature' that is often used in science today (or in textbooks) is that it is a misleading way of putting what in actuality are our best theories. These theories are what, after multiple tests and confirmations, verified as they are separately in experiments, are considered to be true because they give us the best results. They are not considered final. In this sense, 'Laws' as they are used, are actually tentative theories, they are not the final say in any descriptions of reality. This is because even the most well tested and described laws, such as Newton's Laws of Motion and gravitation, have limits. For instance, after Einstein, the laws do not give predictable results at high speeds or small quantities. Thus, Laws can never be Laws in our modern sense of certainty because they are incomplete. They raise further questions about physical phenomena that require further experimentation and testing. These questions are raised when we synthesize it with other laws that we know from other experiments, or from before. For example the recent discovery of the Hiigs Boson can be considered a result that has been built upon not just our knowledge of quantum mechanics, but also our understanding of electromagnetism and classical mechanics. The lack of a unifying theory does not mean that we do not understand nature. Often, we are dependent on these theories to built upon our understanding of reality and nature. It is fundamentally important then to distinguish between the metaphysical question of whether nature can really be discovered as it is by our senses, and whether there are laws of nature that are scientific theories to be discovered through experimentation, that are dependent on our senses. 

something should presumably have to replace the question-mark against all logical possibility. And then even if something did replace it against all logical possibility, humans are at most right now merely demigods compared to dogs. Might this put a substantial hitch on some theoretical maximum of intelligence? Update 1 2014-10-17: While no one has pointed this out yet, during my discussions so far I realized that the frame of mind at around the time of generating this curiosity could readily concede to "The analogy breaks down if superintelligence (including up to hyperintelligence) necessarily must originate from at least as low as human-level intelligence." ... As a corollary, this doesn't bode well for traditional conceptions of God. Update 2 2014-10-17: Responder @ChrisSunami points out that a hunter-gatherer tribe 10 thousand years ago would not have a maximal ontology [in the relevant sense]. Since the main analogy broke down from Update 1, and in light of this hunter-gatherer point, a new analogy becomes forthcoming. 

By assuming the negation of the conclusion, you arrive at a proposition that contradicts a true premise. (We assume our premises are true when the validity, and not the soundness, of the argument is in question. If the soundness were in question then we would also want to know if the premises really are true, but the soundness is not in question right now.) If ~B leads to a contradiction, then it must be false. In classical logic, if ~B is false then B is true. What if we have all true premises and don't arrive at a contradiction by the same method? 

The propositions ~C, ~D, and ~A were not contradictions of any propositions that you derived. For example, up to those points, you had not derived C, D, or A. If you would have, you would have arrived at a contradiction sooner than when you arrived at B and ~B. For your first question, here's a much a simpler problem, and with words, so it's easier to get the idea. 

I would like to answer your question directly and succintly. First, you need to start reading a lot. Philosophy helps in that, it presents arguments that requires you to dissect those parts of the proposition, and reconsider it. Read introductory books on critical thinking, philosophy, but also expand your horizons and see what is going on in current affairs. This is because most of the fallacies are out there in the media, that often present a biased point of view, subtly or covertly. Second, discuss with people good in understanding arguments. Not just any person who is familiar with philosophy or critical thinking, because such a person may not be a good arguer, or someone who understands argument. Third, practice. With increasing practice breeds familiarity, and you will be good over time naturally. Doing nothing leads to no improvement and subsequently, nothing. 

Empirically, no. In our imaginations, yes. That is essentially what you have referred to in the conception by children from images and symbols which seem to refer to their existence. You cannot prove an ideal conception conceived purely from objects situated in reality. For one could almost conceive of any imaginary object if we put them together. Consider what David Hume says, that there is a difference between 'matters of fact' and 'relations of ideas', in Chapter 4 in his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. To simplify, matters of fact are things that, no matter what word we assign to it, are true in this world because they exist. They are established by evidence, which in turn are presaged upon 'cause and effect'. Relations of ideas are when, based on certain ideas we hold in our mind, establish them to be true by the mere thought of it. This includes mathematical and geometrical ideas, but also ideas we put together from different 'matters of fact'. That is, things that we hold true from evidence. So Santa Claus is a combination of many ideas from evidence put together as an imaginary whole. The idea of a man in a red costume, with his moose and a some 'human' looking elves, are taken from real life. We distort this picture by making this man and his moose fly, jumping into the chimneys of houses, carrying a host of goods into them (even apartments without chimneys), and give him a sense of humor. This is the imaginary picture we transmit to children, through word-of-mouth and images we draw and enact, therefore to them, there is a possibility that this imaginary figure is real, given that the empirical evidence was not told to them truthfully, but turned into a festive season made real. 

I can see the power behind the argument because to get around it a person would either have to stretch the imagination into areas that might seem implausible or have to solve a lot of academic problems, if the person is to be satisfied that Mary has all the facts and that all the facts are physical facts. Foregoing the route of solving a lot of academic problems for now, I think we can continue to think about Mary in a way that derives directly from your formulation, RECURSIVE FARTS. The original Mary is characterized with the standard scientific kind, as having descriptive knowledge. If it's implied that she has procedural knowledge, which standardly tends to be an engineering kind, it's not very much. In domains where descriptive knowledge is enough, interfacing with things around you tends to be enough. You don't need to begin an approach to knowing the inner workings of things to the extent of knowing how to reconstruct them or something like them. That is, you don't need to begin an approach that's pointed to knowing things in themselves. At most, you'd need to know enough to create simulations, which, while a lot of times very sophisticated, is not the same. But descriptive knowledge isn't always enough in all domains where physical knowledge is required. Additional knowledge is required to assemble basic components (which are usually for larger systems). Without getting into whether or not Mary has the "right kind" of knowledge about colors, we can already say she lacks some physical knowledge. That is, she doesn't know how to assemble basic components. Or, at least, she doesn't have the facilities to assemble basic components and gain the knowledge of herself going through the process of assembling the basic components. Indeed, this would be just like you said, this would be a posteriori knowledge, RECURSIVE FARTS(). Now that we may begin to question the sobriety of the original caricature of Mary, we may be able to close in on settling the issue. Even letting alone the question of the life-changing subjective quality of strolling through the wilderness, we know that as it stands Mary neither has enough knowledge ab intra nor has enough knowledge a fortiori. However, provided proper education and further facilities, whether industrial or surgically integrated with her body, she would simply demonstrate her sufficiently complete knowledge of the physical world. First she would make basic nanoconstructors. Then she would make physical replicas of everyday inanimate objects. Then she would make physical replicas of archaea. (...) And finally, for now, she would give you a neural implant to complement hers for bidirectional communication of art works and anything else that could be seen in virtual reality. Of course, the tests she had to perform to get such magic right must've involved having knowledge of the physical world to such a degree that it went much beyond descriptive knowledge, and into its superset of acquaintance knowledge. Having physical descriptive knowledge is simply not the only kind of physical knowledge to have. 

I'm just getting seriously into Nietzsche. What I can answer in response to your question is that you might want to look to the Presocratics for answers. Nietzsche was a philologist, and his specialty was in linguistics. He admired the Presocratics (and the Sophists) and despised Plato. If he might refer to in any ancient society, it will most likely be Greek society. However, I think it is more important not to conflate Nietzsche's ideas with historical facts. In many cases he uses words interchangably to denote the same thing. For instance, he often uses the word 'Jew' or 'Jewish ideas' to denote what is essentially Judeo-Christain ideas and moral philosophy. They have nothing to do with the people per se. Thus, if you try to find a resemblance to facts in reality to what he writes, you run the risk of mis-interpreting him. One important thing in that passage you referred to is that he is simply relating ideas of 'purity' to certain physical activities in primitive man (or humans). It need not refer to any group or society. What he is saying is that notions or concepts of purity stem from a certain physical fear of unhygienic-ness or dirt. It has nothing to do with a priori concepts of 'pure' or perfection, which is what Christain moral philosophy posits. In other words, Nietzsche is saying that there is a biological/social origin to these concepts which, after many generations, got lost and became thought of as pure by later society, which have forgotten or misconstrued where it originated from. That is the purpose of the genealogy, to link concepts of pure, perfect, the moral uprighteousness that is an intrinsic part of christian moral philosophy, and to undermine it by linking it to an intrinsically biological/social process, that over time, was inverted from what it initially was: a fear of the dirty, unclean etc. - a very primitive, raw human basis from where it came from.
