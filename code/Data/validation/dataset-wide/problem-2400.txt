Enlightened beings are not bothered by pain. But if you try to sit through severe back pain, it could lead to further complications. The body requires lying down to recover from back problems. So it's the sensible thing to do. When the Buddha is resting, he usually resides in the Jhanas. Even when the Buddha is not resting, it is said that he enters the Jhanas between every sentence he speaks. 

Buddhists don't consider Buddha to be a god. Buddhists consider Buddha as a being beyond any god. That's why he is called "Satta Deva Manussanam" - the teacher to gods and humans. The things you mentioned are forms of paying respect to the Buddha. If you learn the meanings of the stanzas Buddhists chant while worshipping, you will understand the purpose better. The statues are used just as a representation of the Buddha. They know that those are not the real Buddha and that they are made of stone or wood. The concept is similar to people using framed pictures of their dead parents and lighting candles etc. as a form of respect and appreciation. 

Buddhavamsa by most venerable Mingun Sayadaw Bhaddanta Vicittasarabhivamsa. He is best known for his memory skills and his role in the Sixth Buddhist Council. The late Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw was appointed to ask the required questions about the Dhamma to the Ven. Bhadanta Vicittasarabhivamsa, who answered them. 

Because until he became the Buddha he hadn't eliminated craving. Craving leads to clinging, clinging leads to becoming, becoming leads to birth. 

The issue with this question is that it assumes that vegetarian food production does not kill animals. Farming causes many deaths due to deforestation, pesticides, weedicides, electric fences and other animal traps. It can also contribute to landslides which even cause human deaths. So when you buy meat from the supermarket, if you are responsible for the animal who was slaughtered, you are also responsible for the animals killed in vegetarian food production, when you buy vegetarian food. 

Samma Ajiva - the third and the last member of the morality group of the Noble Eightfold Path is what you want to read about. The Right Livelihood means abstaining from any of the forbidden modes of living. Five kinds of livelihood are discouraged : trading in animals for slaughter, dealing in weapons, dealing in slaves, dealing in poison and dealing in intoxicants. So select a job which doesn't require you to do those. Which college to go to? If you are looking for additional criteria apart from academic facilities, select a college where Buddhism and Vipassana meditation is taught. Select a place where you have a high chance of meeting "Kalyana Mittas". In other words, a place where you can make friends with people who learn and practice the Dhamma. 

If you can come to Sri Lanka, you can follow a diploma or a post graduate diploma in Buddhism at the Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka. In the mean time, you can get a good start with books like Buddhism in a Nutshell by Ven. Narada thera. Or the life of the Buddha. 

"aging-less, illness-less, deathless, sorrow-less, undefiled, unexcelled rest from the yoke: Unbinding" here refers to Nibbana. So yes, it is the goal in Theravada Budhhism. 

You can follow Buddhism and get results in any society. But as a Buddhist, you will come across less obstructions in societies in which Buddhism is the main religion. Especially for monks, life is easier in Asian Buddhist countries compared to others as the people almost consider it as a duty to support and protect the community of the Sangha. Monks keep to the 227 precepts and the lay people keep to 5 or 8 precepts. Monks advice lay people on spiritual development and the lay people support the monks by providing the necessities of life and what is helpful for teaching the Dhamma. The Buddhist lay people are not prohibited to spend money on the newest technical equipment or the latest fashion or any other sense pleasure that wouldn't break the precepts. It's just that they are being advised by the monks that those comforts are temporary and are encouraged to practice spiritual development whenever they can, in order to attain the final solace. 

What would be your plan of action, if you saw someone running a brothel with your mother's name and picture on it? Feeling angry or not depends on if you have eradicated anger. You can do Metta meditation to deal with your anger. But that doesn't mean it is wrong to take action against such establishments, even if they mean no disrespect. There's nothing wrong in peacefully protesting, trying to make them come to their senses or using any legal options available. You don't actually have to get angry while doing it. You are doing them a favor since they are committing bad Karma due to their ignorance. Buddhists don't always have to accept people's ignorant acts meekly in the name of Metta. Once there was this cobra practicing loving-kindness in the forest saying: May all beings be well, may all beings be happy, may all beings be peaceful. And an old woman who was collecting firewood saw this cobra and mistook it for a rope. So she used it to tie up the firewood that she was carrying. As the cobra was doing loving-kindness practice, it allowed this woman to do anything. So after the woman carried the bundle of firewood home, the cobra escaped, but with a lot of wounds and physical pain. So he went to meet his teacher who was the hermit(Bodhisatta) staying in that forest. The cobra said: See what happened to me! I was practicing loving-kindness, and now see the wounds and all the pain that I'm experiencing in my body! The teacher very calmly said: You have not been practicing loving-kindness. You have been practicing idiotic compassion, because you should have shown that you were a cobra. You should at least have hissed! So with regards to people like the person you've described, you have to learn to hiss, and in doing so you'll also be doing a service for that person. So if you have any crowd pull, go hiss without biting. :) Or use social media to protest and let them know about it. If business owners get the idea that whenever they do something like that, there will be negative consequences, they will be reluctant to do it in the future as it is bad for business. 

Yes, Lord Buddha did teach a method to overcome depression. It's called meditation. Depression is usually caused by low self esteem or excessive worrying. Both are caused because of one's clinging to a self or clinging to conditioned phenomena as things belonging to oneself. If you do Samatha meditation and attain the Jhanas, depression can't trouble you as long as you are in them. If you do Vipassana and eliminate craving, there won't be any clinging. Thus no depression ever again. 

It does not unless the egg is alive. Eggs sold in supermarkets are usually unfertilized. Fish oil is not an animal. 

Whether you know these by correct category is not important. What's important is if you note each and everything without skipping. Here an easy guide book for you 

They are born in full form with palaces and all the other requirements. They are not clumsy like humans at birth. So they don't need to spend a childhood orienting themselves to the world, studying and acquiring skills to make money just to get food, clothes and lodging. That saves a lot of time. They don't get sick. It can be difficult to meditate if you get sick often. They don't have bodily discomfort. So they can sit in one position for a long time. This is actually more useful if you do Samatha first and then turn it to Vipassana. They don't have to take bath or cleanup as divine food has no excrements. So while meditations like Patikulamanasikara won't work in heavens, it saves time for other meditations. Their life spans are huge. So once they learn a meditation technique, they can keep practicing it without having to learn it all over again. They don't get angry easily, so they can possibly attain concentration faster, if they seclude themselves (helpful for samatha pubbangama vipassana). They possibly get to meet other Devas and Brahmas who have directly heard the Dhamma from the Buddha. The Abhidhamma was fully preached at Tavatimsa heaven. So there are Devas and Brahmas who have heard the comprehensive version. We humans only have the summarized version. The higher chance of meeting enlightened beings in heaven compared to human world nowadays. The ability to read the minds can help them recognize enlightened beings easily. The divine eyes and the divine ears can be used to listen to all the sermons of the Buddha even from the palace. The chance to hear the Dhamma from several Buddhas 

Sankhara in the five aggregates can include neutral mental formations as well. But Sankhara as in Avijja paccaya Sankhara refers specifically to Karma. Vinnana in the five aggregates can be any of the 6 types of consciousnesses. Eye consciousness, ear consciousness, nose consciousness etc. depending on the sense that is active. But Vinnana as in Sankhara Paccaya Vinnana is just the Patisandhi Citta. Only the mind consciousness is present at that point. Vedana as in Passa paccaya Vedana can be Vedana caused at any of the 6 sense doors. But before the sense doors are created, Nama-rupa is just the embryo accompanied by a stream of Bhavanga cittas with the birth Karma as the object. The vedana there is caused by the birth Karma instead of contact at the 6 senses. More info here. In fact, all entries in Paticcasamuppada belong to the five aggregates or the nama-rupa. But Paticcasamuppada uses specific instances to explain the process of causes and effects that leads to suffering. So it doesn't qualify as repetition. 

Apart from what you have mentioned, materialists usually think that the mind is a byproduct of the brain. In other words, electrical traces stored in neurons. This is not the case in Buddhism. Brain is a concept according to Buddhism. The reality is fundamentally grouped into 2 categories: the mental(Nama) and the physical(Rupa). The four noble truths hold true at all times regardless of what one believes. But one is not able to attain enlightenment, if one holds to the view that all mental activities end at death. This belief is called Saggawarana & Maggawarana: conceals the path to heavens and conceals the path to enlightenment. Here's a related answer by ven.Yuttadhammo. 

The sutta doesn't say that the Buddha allowed him to commit suicide. When Mara reported this to the Buddha, venerable Godhika committed suicide. Then the Buddha saw what has happened and said that he has attained Nibbana. According to Bhikkhu Vinaya, the only allowable act that comes close to committing suicide is rejecting medication, if you are suffering from a terminal illness and being a burden to everyone around you. 

Nobody! A being traveling through a Samsara is simply used in the metaphoric sense to give teachings at conceptual level. In reality, it's just Paticcasamuppada. Sankhara paccaya Vinnana - Dependent on Karma consciousness arises 

Then that would just be an imagination. Because 100% of life(moments of arising and ceasing of five aggregates) is composed of unsatisfactory states. This is why the first noble truth is something that you should realise. The noble truth of suffering is not just about painful sensations. That is just one type of suffering called Dukkha-dukkha. There's also Viparinama Dukkha that is caused when you cling to pleasant experiences. Then there is Sankhara Dukkha which means the unsatisfactory nature of all conditioned phenomena. You think drinking, eating, partying or simply feeling pleasurable sensations is good because you haven't realised the first noble truth yet. You think Nibbana is zero because you haven't realised the 3rd noble truth yet. 

Yes, it is. This is called the Upattambaka(Supportive) Kamma. In case of lower births, this type of Kamma worsens the living conditions. 

No! Patavi, Apo, Tejo, Vayo are elements of Rupa. Pain is a sensation caused by those elements coming into contact with the sense doors while the the mind is present. 

To practice Vipassana, what you need is right mindfulness or Samma-sati. Concentration comes as you develop right mindfulness. There are actually four ways of doing it. You can develop concentration first and then switch to Vipassana or develop both concentration and Vipassana in tandem or develop Vipassana first and then switch to concentration. Whoever claims that developing concentration first is the only way is misinformed. Read the Yuganaddha Sutta for details. 

There are many factors keeping you bound to the lay life. Having children is only one of them. Prince Siddhartha had a son when he left. It's just that your Nekkhamma thoughts are still not strong enough to break the bonds of lay life. You don't really have any special problem apart from being subjected to the 1st noble truth. Keep doing good and cultivating the mind through meditation. When Nekkhamma Sankhappa overpowers clinging, you will leave the lay life. 

I've also heard about the story of venerable Moggallana getting lost in space, trying to look for the end of the universe. Then the Buddha said to have sent a beam of light to guide him back to earth. I couldn't find an online resource for the story. 

The Tipitaka was written down during the 4th Buddhist council which was held in Sri Lanka. It was headed by Venerable Maharakkhita and five hundred other Arahants. Lord Buddha never said not to accept the word of the Arahanths. Those who question the authenticity of the Tipitaka and the commentaries are just individuals surfacing from time to time. They don't represent any Buddhist council and they might not even have attained any stage of enlightenment. So unless you have undeniable proof that some teaching is not inline with Buddhism, it's best to accept the ruling of the councils instead of accepting the modern commentaries of certain individuals when you don't have proof either way. It takes away the worry of having to prove everything and gives you a nice state of mind to work on your salvation with confidence.
