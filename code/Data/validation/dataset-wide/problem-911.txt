which is plausibly a shortened form of D'Israeli's citation.) The phrase sich nicht lesen does not appear in D'Israeli's book. Were there German editions of Curiosities, or German analogues of Curiosities, in which Poe might have seen the phrase in question? Added 21 December. Among the German disparagers of the Hortulus was Martin Luther, whose own Betbüchlin [sic] (of 1522) or Personal Prayer Book starts with this negative assessment: 

A glance here and there in the text shows that "hearth" means "fireplace", and metaphorically, "home". In the most literal sense: Chap 69 

Hortulus Animae (or better in French) is the usual answer. See, for instance, section 3 of this essay: 

As to what the prophet said of the naked babe, look at The Legends of King Arthur and his Knights, 1862, by James Knowles (apparently with the complicity of Tennyson) with this version of Merlin's prophecy, paraphrased from Geoffrey. 

Here there is no statement of anything improper in the smoking room, but the fact that the captain preferred the gentilities of the ladies' saloon to the smoking room does allow us to surmise that tobacco, slang, puns and anecdotes, etc. might be found there. (Chapter 2 also has a smoking room episode.) Other hits are more to the point. Jean Harrell's 1995 Caravagio and his two cardinals has this zinger: 

I think it's a reference to money lenders, who were (or were perceived to be) Jewish. Heirs of rich people would borrow money to support their life styles, money to be paid back (under the terms of a post-obit bond) when they inherited the family fortune. (Or so it works out in novels by Georgette Hayer, Bulwer-Lytton, Disraeli, etc.) The OED has a bunch of citations, including a different Byron one. So on the death of the wealthy ancestor, the once-poor heir would be pestered by the money lenders. 

The German word "Funker" means radio operator. (From the German word Funke for spark, funkeln = "to sparkle", etc. The funk morpheme was used in the vocabulary of the early 20th century development of radio, when the "spark gap radio" was the hot technology. It lives on in modern German in the words Funk = "radio", Rundfunk = "broadcast", funken = "to communicate by radio", etc. Cf. the English slang "Sparks" for a radio-man at sea.) As several of the comments indicate, "wireless man" was used as an informal equivalent of "wireless operator" in the early part of the last century. 

Wordy, but fun to write. From context, "smoking-room stories" means something like off-color stories, dirty stories, steamy stories. One dictionary entry for the adjectival form of "smoking-room" glosses it as "Marked by indecency; obscene: smoking-room humor." If you google "smoking-room humor" you will get many relevant hits, of varying degrees of sordidness. (All subsequent examples were found this way.) At one extreme, an odd 1899 novel My smoking room companions by William King, apparently devoid of sordidness but full of piffle. Only slightly more relevant but more fun to read is Mark Twain's 1898 Following the equator, where in chapter 1 he describes the captain of an ocean liner: 

In common: the dream-like passage of time at sea, the sun and moon doing their thing. Not in common: the anxiety about getting to Takaroa, the rebellion of the soul against memory and oblivion. As I mentioned in a comment, Camus is possibly reflecting, and changing, whatever he read in Stevenson, making it richer and rarer, and thereby less Googleable. 

I do not pretend to understand this. The phrase that Poe quotes, "er lasst [or "lässt] sich nicht lesen" does not seem to appear in the text, at least my brief skim through the digital image of a copy at Heidelberg, nor is it a phrase that would be expected to appear. A later printing of the book is described in Isaac D'Israeli's Curiosities of Literature in these terms, in his section "Religious Nouvellettes": 

The first story sounds like a version of We Die Alone by David Howarth, an account of Jan Baalsrud's ordeal. The second story sounds like Paul Brickhill's 1950 account The Great Escape, or a derivative rewrite. See this for an account of the events. 

Various old editions are online; I have looked at the 1544 Wittenburg edition, and have checked the above translation, which I cribbed from p 231,232 of "Luther on the Psalter" by C. A. Aurelius in T. J. Wengert Harvesting Martin Luther's Reflections on Theology, Ethics, and the Church. Wouldn't it be cool if Poe's source for "er lässt sich nicht lesen" was some other piece of writing by Luther? 

I think it means that Catherine's barouche, which bore her crest on her trip to the Crimea in 1787, was now Don Juan's and bore his crest. (The classical name of the Crimea was Tauris, which was visited by Iphigenia in a play by Euripides under somewhat different circumstances from Catherine's visit. To call Catherine a new Iphigenia seems absurd to me, but I lack imagination.) 

I think "like Achates, faithful to the tomb" means "like Achates, who was [Aeneas's] faithful friend forever". Just as Achates would join any fight Aeneas was in, so too the attorney would join any legal fight his clients were in. A paraphrase of the sentence might be: "Only the attorney was amused, because no matter what the dispute was about, it would be settled legally, and he would faithfully support his client's interests, just like Achates would fight for Aeneas no matter what." 

This is an instance of litotes. (Using "understatement to emphasize a point by stating a negative to further affirm a positive, often incorporating double negatives for effect", says the mother of all knowledge.) "By no means boded" = "did not augur well" = "looked bad". Because a third were killed, it seemed that victory was not not certain [here I'm doing it, too], that is, victory was unlikely. 

I think the phrase "let her start And shake at pleasure,–nor conclude at yours," should be understood something like "let her start and shake at [her] pleasure, and not conclude at your [pleasure]", or, more loosely, "let her start and stop when she wants, not when you want". There is, however, the ambiguity of "start". Does it mean jolt or does it mean begin, as my paraphrases here take it? (My OED lists both, with the jolt sense coming before the begin sense.) The occurrence in "start and shake" makes the jolt sense seem more likely, but the opposition with "conclude" makes the begin sense more likely. Is it allowed for a poet to use a word in two senses at once? 

It gives five citations of this sense, dating from 1774 through 1852, including one to this passage in DJ. Others: "Though the Savages held out and, as the phrase is, had better bottoms, yet for a spurt the Englishmen were more nimble and speedy." "They ... have their manes and tails cropped ... under the supposition that it adds to their strength and bottom" and "For solidity, bottom, and a courage that never wavers, they [British troops] are incomparable". 

Your question "How can I find information about the editions of a book?" has no simple general answer. There is a whole field of learning devoted to it: "bibliography". Basic questions in that field are: what are the various editions of such and such a book, where and when did they appear, what are the relationships between them, what are the differences between them? The answers here depend on the purpose of the questions. Often, for instance, publishers will print essentially the same book with identical contents but different title-and-copyright pages showing (say) London as the place of publication of the one edition and New York as the other. For some purposes I suppose this counts as one edition, for others, as two. Depending on the era, and kind of book, and importance of the book, there might be shortcuts. Library catalogs often help a lot. For very recent books (after the invention of the ISBN, say) there are various databases used by the book-selling industry. You can ask experts in the subject matter of the book in question. For instsance, if I wanted to know about the various editions of the work of the cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, I'd ask a friend who is a scholarly Peanuts fiend. 

Good question, interesting to research. Short answer: Green got it from Layamon. Green says in his Author's Note: 

and much more of a similar kidney. D'Israeli does not approve, and might well have written that this book ought not be read. (The possibility that Poe knew of Hortulus through D'Israeli is given in a footnote in the Library of America edition of Poe, edited by Patrick F. Quinn. The form of Poe's footnote citing the Hortulus is
