I always assumed that those numbers were to be approximated as well as possible -- short of coming up with a machine for measuring Intensity of pleasure and pain, how else could we know? I think this is evidenced by the fact that the equations typically used for a hedonistic calculus are a. always symbolic and b. never quite right. For example, I tend to see that intensity should be multiplied by duration, when anybody who understands basic calculus understands that it must, rather, be integrated over time. I don't think the development of the calculus serves as anything more than a thought experiment -- "here's how you should think about ethics. Think of ethics as an equation, a mathematical function that spits out a 'do X' or a 'do not do X.'" The details of the equation are only there to show you that such an equation can take many details into account, and appear quite valid on its face -- it does not seem that it is for actual use. 

I personally define art as any attempt to be understood. The value of art -- I suppose, the quality -- may be some function of 

I'm not sure if this will satisfy you, but it's another (rather obvious) way to think about it -- a line is some function the derivative of which is a constant, or the second derivative of which is zero. When you look at the collection of infinitessimal line segments you described earlier, does each one have the same slope -- the same tangent -- as the ones before and after it? I guess the concepts of slope and tangent are also based in the concept of the line, but this still appeals to my intuitions. It's not altogether absurd to call a circle a "line" that is biased towards a center. In this case, every infinitessimal segment follows a pattern set by the one before it, where its "path" changes according to that pattern, that bias towards the center. A "straight" line is one with no such bias -- where every line segment is just a transposition of the last, with no transformation. My ideas are starting to bleed into one another, but I guess that's fine, because it doesn't seem like you're looking for an answer, so much as scratching of an itch. Hope I helped. 

Yes. The most obvious and quick answer to your question is: Do you know for sure that there is no Strong AI in existence right now? If your answer is no (which it should be), then you must also believe that it is possible for Strong AI to exist without us being certain that it can exist. Another, more long-winded one: Based on the constraints of your scenario, this happens in a world in which Strong AI is possible. In such a world, the entirety of intelligence and consciousness are nothing more than physical processes. IE: The physicalist approach to the mind/body problem is the correct one. I suppose one could argue that Strong AI doesn't require a mind to exist, but I feel like if you redefine Strong AI that way you're not talking about what we normally think of as Strong AI. If this is the case, then there is no fundamental difference between the thoughts of a person and the actions of a computer, we're just programmed differently. While the effects of the algorithm, or the effects of human thought are difficult or impossible to predict with precision, the fact remains that they are purely the result of physical processes. The system, while perhaps very very complex, ultimately boils down to interactions between molecules. So the question of whether we will "realize" that Strong AI is possible is unrelated to the truth-value of whether it is possible, our "realizations" are merely a complex interaction of molecules. There is no reason to suspect that the existence of AI will send out molecules/waves of light that will interact with the cells in our brains in such a way that we will "realize" that it is possible to create AI. 

The phrase "if and only if" is used rarely in daily English; it tends to be used only for emphasis, or to avoid an otherwise unavoidable ambiguity. When it is used, it has the same meaning as the mathematical/logical usage. To summarize: "if and only if" is always a biconditional, both in mathematical/logical usage and plain English usage; "if" can be a biconditional in plain English usage, depending on context, but not in mathematical/logical usage. 

Not only could it possibly be false, but there exist two-and-a-half millenia's worth of Buddhist philosophy attempting to draw out the implications of its falsehood. 

Short answer: no. "Survival of the fittest" means, as you point out, that the creatures most suited to their environment survive. What constitutes the environment, however, is not static, and necessarily changes over time. What is "fit" for one environment may no longer be fit as the environment changes: the dinosaurs are an object lesson here. Furthermore, all creatures, by the very act of existing, have an impact on their environment, changing it sometimes subtly, sometimes blatantly. Humans are not an exception in this regard. So: evolution is occurring, the same as it ever was. In the case of your hypothetical: if the seventy grandchildren are able to go through life without breaking any bones, they are clearly fit to their environment. If not, they will die and fail to pass on their genes. So it goes. If an earthquake kills off all of those with brittle bones, then the survivors will go on to reproduce. If those survivors happen to not be human, then we join the dinosaurs. And so it goes. 

The language in the first statement is meant to invoke a hypothetical scenario, whereas in the second I am merely making a statement about the world as it currently is. The difference has to do with the truth value of the statement itself. A Material Conditional statement is true as long as for every situation in which the first part is true, the second part is also true. It makes no guarantees about the logical coherence of the statement when applied to hypothetical situations. Technically any statement of P->Q is true as long as either P is false or both P and Q are true, regardless of whether or not there is any causal connection between P and Q. A Counterfactual is making a statement about necessity that states that regardless of the current truth value of P, if things were ever in a condition in which P were the case, Q would also be the case. Here is an example I stole from wikipedia to illustrate the difference: Counterfactual: If I were in Poland, I would be in Europe. (true, though the method to evaluate such truth is hotly contested) Material Conditional: If I were in Poland, I would be in Africa (also true, because I am not in Poland so this has no binding effect on the truth or falsehood of the second part) What we usually want when we discuss things in real life is the counter-factual. It is not making a claim about the real world only, but also about hypothetical ones. This is how we usually think and what we mean in colloquial speech when we say "If... then..." most of the time. 

It is greater than God and more evil than the devil. The poor have it, the rich need it and if you eat it youâ€™ll die. What is it? ... I hate riddles like that. Because the whole point of a riddle is "fit something into this odd set of rules," and there isn't anything that fits into this odd set of rules, and the only answer is to give up. And that's supposed to be clever. So... yes, it's easy for people to think that "nothing" is an affirmative type of thing... But if you're worried about that, just be conscious of what you're saying when you say it, and what others are saying when you say it. I think that actual problems with the word "nothing" will be rare, but hey, you might catch some weird issues. 

The value of what is to be understood, whether it is a lesson, emotion, or bare fact. Its effectiveness in being understood by its intended audience. This is a tough one, in that I certainly appreciate a lot of music that I can't say I fully understand -- but perhaps the intent was for me to understand an emotion, or the effect of a certain sound or technique... Perhaps there were many intentions, and I have appreciated some but not others. I also know that much great art is written so that it will be misunderstood -- see "The Road Not Taken," or the passage with the "must haves" in "The Great Gatsby." I don't want to say that the quality of the art is a function of its impact, or how much its audience appreciates it. But I'm relatively satisfied with the way I've phrased this -- "its effectiveness in being understood by its intended audience." The uniqueness of that effort -- if I can have an audience understand a message that it could not otherwise easily understand, I may have accomplished something greater than if I had reiterated a thought that my audience already understood. Other factors. I really don't know. I think it's subjective at the end of the day, but if it's a function, it certainly isn't this simple. 

The key distinction between a definition and a simple list of characteristics seems to me to be that the latter would include accidental and contingent properties, and the former is more concerned with the essential properties. So, while the ability to hold down papers in the wind is a property of an avocado, it is not an essential property; on the other hand, it is the essential property of a paperweight. And, as you indicate, if the avocado is functioning as a paperweight, any definition will have to be contextual-- are you being asked about the avocado qua avocado or the avocado qua paperweight? 

Not in the slightest. Nietzsche calling Christianity a "slave morality" does not mean it is the only form of "slave morality", and there is absolutely no reason he would have us believe that today's (allegedly) "post-Christian and secular Western Europe" would be any less a slave morality; the fact that it is committed to the notion of "democracy" should be indication enough (as, for Nietzsche, the democratic impulse is slave morality par excellence.) 

In that case, let's start with your specific examples, and then move on to the general case. You claim that: 

Already, we are in a bit of trouble here. "Category" is a philosophical term, dating back to Aristotle, and "smartphone" is not a category in this sense. "Class" used in this manner is not; it is a software engineering term. Since we are speaking of groups of properties, let us propose "entity" as a philosophical replacement.
