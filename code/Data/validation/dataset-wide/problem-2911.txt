In the "Unmoved Mover" proof, by talking about potentiality and actuality, we see God as the thing that brings actuality to everything, and as Thomas says ("nothing can be reduced from potentiality to actuality, except by something in a state of actuality"), God is in a state of actuality for all things. When Thomas gets to the transcendentals (Truth, Goodness, Beauty), he can then identify God with the transcendentals because God is the ultimate actuality of them (i.e., God is Truth, etc.). In the "From Contingency" proof, we see that God does not require anything (his existence is not contingent on anything). In particular, this means that he didn't need to create the universe, and that creation was therefore the ultimate act of love (because it was something done for its own sake, not for God's own). 

Quine's naturalistic holism is marked by the idea that our methodology should be concerned with empirical data as understood by modern science in conjunction with the idea that every theory is underdetermined by the data it espouses to interpret. This seems to lead to the conclusion that our theories are never certain, and are always open to revision. But suppose the traditional epistemologist thinks that what Quine means in the first half of this supposition, regarding his empiricism, is in need of clarification. The epistemologist would want to ask Quine just what qualifies as 'science' or more plainly 'empirical'. Or perhaps in questioning Quine's holism the traditional epistemologist wants to know why Quine thinks to begin with that a theory being undertetermined by empirical data is suggestive of what Quine thinks it's suggestive of. Furthermore, one might question the globalism of Quine's holism, and how he moves from points of an empirical nature to knowledge simpliciter. These questions might very well arise in the spirit of Quine's holism itself, wherein their answers are uncertain and dictated by whatever conditions characterize their place in the 'web of belief', in which case Quine could respond to them with relative ease. But where they are truly interesting is where they arise outside of the context of Quine's holism, in question of Quine's holism. The traditional epistemologist holds that unless these questions have specific answers there is no justification of Quine's holism, no reason for them to accept Quine's holism (and no reason for Quine to accept his own holism). Indeed, when these questions are asked in the context of accepting Quine's holism as true, an inevitable circularity ensues, as Quine himself admits of his naturalism elsewhere. For Quine's relativistic holism requires that there be no set 'criterion' for determining what is and isn't 'science', nor even a set criterion for what is and isn't 'holism'. To accept Quine's holism is expected by Quine to be a provision that stems from his holism itself. But be it that accepting his holism is what is in question, it seems that Quine is begging the question against those who are seeking a standard or justification of his methodology. 

Bishop (then Father) Robert Barron has a talk he did about 10 years ago where he discusses this in Aquinas and Joyce. He says (referring back to Aquinas - a summary of these ideas can be found on the IEP Aesthetics article) that an aesthetic experience consists in three things: 

Are there non-religious traditions that acknowledge "absolute goodness?" Here are a couple approaches: Objectivism considers there to be such a thing as correct and incorrect moral choices, and happens to originate from an atheist. Descartes took only his own existence as axiomatic, and from that used only reason to derive moral right and wrong. Of course, he happened to be religious, but I non-religious people since have taken similar approaches. Isn't ethics about justice? If you read about ethics and justice, you will see that justice is only a part of the study of ethics, but it is obviously an important part and it is difficult to discuss ethics without discussing justice. If 

Wittgenstein is stated as having said "we must do away with the explanation and description alone must take its place" (PI 109). But isn't this akin to the myth of the given that Sellars attacked? Can a clear distinction really be made between providing a description and providing an explanation? Doesn't the one effectively permeate the other? One example that comes to mind that seems to leave the two interconnected is the description of a banana being thrown in the air. We might describe the situation as Jim throwing the banana, or causing the banana to be thrown, into the air. But here the description of the event, namely Jim hurling the banana into the air, is inclusive of two events, the event of Jim with a banana in his hand, and the event of the little banana hurling through the air (probably much to its dissatisfaction). But, in this way, there is the occurrence of an explanation of an event within the mere 'description' of an event, the explanation being the induction of causality. Indeed, so long as there is a certain ambiguity in what single 'event' we might be offering a description of and in what circumstances we offer a description of it, it seems to be the case that any given event can give way to be an explanation just as much as it can a description. For example, when a detective asks 'what happened here?', you as a witness might give him the rundown on what happened. And yet, you are both describing what happened, insofar as you are recounting what happened, and offering an explanation, insofar as you are clarifying the situation for the person asking what happened. So there is a continuity in some cases between description and assertion, dependent on the context in which one states the occurrences of a given event. As a last bit of inquiry, is Wittgenstein's criticisms of explanation (insofar as it is a criticism of 'private states of meaning' perverting what is simply observed of 'public behavior') similar in any way to Hume's criticism of induction? Both seem to me to be criticizing a mental sort of behavior that impedes or contorts the naturalistic (or simply 'natural') experiences and observances made in our ordinary course of life. 

I don't know much about Kierkegaard, but this summary from Wikipedia seems to explain the issue you're running into: 

Every material object/event has a cause (one observes this in daily experience). There must be a beginning to the chain of existence (as a result of the universe beginning with the Big Bang). Therefore, the initial cause must be a non-material being. 

Some points: Universality: We shouldn't assume that expletives all match English usage. Taking Catullus as an example, that curses in Latin often were not merely shocking as they are in English, they were often degrading and involved accusing the other party of being less than others. Effectiveness: Have you ever seen an argument won this way? 

Wittgenstein is critical of the 'private linguist' and his exclusive use of the ostensive definition, where the definition provided for a given word is an example or a 'pointing out' of what the word might refer to. But it would seem that the origin of our language is rooted in ostensive definition. It is after all how children with no prior knowledge of a public language begin to learn a language. Their mother or father points to something while stressing a given word. Wittgenstein doesn't seem to have been one to hold that the entire language game is a farce. As such, what allowed him to criticize ostensive definitions in the private language argument while not coming to criticize language acquisition through ostensive definition in the case of children? 

There are, of course, many different kinds of atheists. The question you raise about existence, self, mind, and so on can be more generally asked as "Do atheists believe in the actual existence of abstract objects?" The answer to this is that it is not necessarily a theist vs. atheist issue but what are one's beliefs about metaphysics. Your next question I take to mean "If atheists are relativists, isn't it contradictory to say that an atheist is absolutely certain about something?" There are two problems with this that I see. First, there are objectivist atheists (Ayn Rand comes to mind). Second, the notion of "relativism" normally is only concerned with non-material things like morality. Most atheists that I've read have no problem being absolutely certain about, for example, the physical properties of an object. 

Quine saw that any group of theories could have the same pieces of data. There is a gap between any set of data and the interpretation we have of it. Quine then felt that in light of this, whether this or that theory/belief were true and correct is relative, since any theory in consideration could contain the same data. But does this conclusion only follow if it is held that the data of theories is the sole form of justification of any theory? 

Quine's holism is marked by a scientific methodology. Perhaps not all beliefs in Quine's web of belief are accurate, but at its best the web consists of the refined, matured string of beliefs which are collectively of a scientific nature. However, a natural question arises: just what qualifies as 'scientific' for Quine? And another question: how is the traditional epistemologist's understanding of knowledge related to Quine's understanding? A simpler summary of these questions is as follows: what does Quine accept and reject of the traditional conception of 'knowledge' and 'science', and how are the two related in Quine's approach? And although it might be asking a bit much, what is the role of pragmatism in all this for Quine? 

Considering the work of Hayek, one could argue that it is in fact ethical for a person to become a doctor because of the high wages. Hayek thought about where prices for goods and services came from, and he was of the opinion that we should think of prices in a functioning market economy as a signal of what society needs - higher prices indicating that we need more of something, lower prices indicating that we need less of something. Thus, the high wages for doctors indicate we may need more of them. Of course, this may not quite be true - there are all sorts of other reasons why wages for doctors (and other professions) have higher wages than society would normally dictate - limiting the number of doctors through licensing, the fixed costs involved in setting up a hospital or private practice, and so on. In some cases, the wages may be high due to these artificial constraints.
