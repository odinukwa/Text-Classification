Yes, the landscape is scattered with nuclear debris. Most nuclear power plant designs will fail spectacularly with long lasting effect on the surrounding area. The notion that nuclear reactors can run for extended periods of time without human intervention is simply not founded in reality. Keeping a nuclear reaction from becoming critical is a feat within itself. It's balancing act of maintaining a state that is less than critical. It will fail within a few months to a few years working under the assumption that it is not getting it's cooling water replenished which is entirely plausible. Most nuclear power plants in the United States require are light water reactors or pressurized water reactors and require the circulation of water in order to stay within a 'steady state' of operational limits. The two failure scenarios that come into play under an unattended state both involve overheating and a change of state to critical. Other incidents occur on the timeline to critical such as hydrogen explosions but these events are essentially ancillary and aren't central to root cause. Background There are two types of nuclear reactors that can suffer from water related failure. 

Eventually a portion of the population will survive Under extreme duress and lack of commodity consumables like medicine, food and water the society will begin to break down and governance will be an afterthought. Communication with the populace from the government will become more and more difficult. As the population seeks out other industrialized nations infrastructure they will encounter the same issues abroad in neighboring countries, a lack of petroleum products to restart manufacturing, lack of potable water, food crisis and all assortment of survival issues associated with a dystopian world crisis. The 8 million people that will require basic staples such as rice and wheat will begin to seek food for survival from their neighbors. Government control will break down and the military will be unable to prevent looting and other fear driven group behavior. Neighbors will die as groups seek to build power to control limited resources. The Swiss do not have a lot working in their favor. Other countries have a more favorable outlook especially if they have a method of mass protein creation as with cattle, poultry and pork. Wheat or rice production in a country is very favorable. France is much more well suited for this sort of situation but most of the above would still apply to them. Where the Swiss will fail 

To answer how an altruistic society might evolve, look at what caused it to evolve to be the way it is now. Most of human history there was scarcity of food and a lot of danger from predators or other human tribes competing for food, so physical strength and ability to amass resources were very important for survival or the group, so such people were viewed positively by society. In the modern world fighting off bears is less of a concern, and a much bigger problem might be environmental collapse. If you extrapolate that further, you could say that in few short thousands of years (or hundreds if you want to be optimistic), humans will evolve to dislike greed, due to it's wastefulness and environmental concerns, while emphasising non-violent cooperation, since efficient use of resources is more important then fighting off things. Eventually creativity, ability to get along and not-hoarding things might become more socially desired then strength and wealth. Also robots will do all the heavy lifting so who needs strength, am I right? 

In general, totalitarian (and other despotic) regimes are great at huge unreasonably expensive projects, just look at the pyramids, or the terracotta army and the whole mountain sized complex that houses it. The only real costs to the regime leaders are time and natural resources. Are they willing to concentrate on a project that may not yield any interesting results before they are dead? Does using resources (including people) to make it happen divert those resources from something else they want have accomplished? Currency would probably not mean anything to the regime (they already own everything that can be bought with it) 

I read that Venice was built on the lagoon because the population was on the run and wanted a place isolated from the Huns but gave them access to the sea. But, is this the only reason for founding a city on water? Tenochtitlan for example was on an endorheic lake and had floating gardens for some agriculture. Wouldn't the banks of some river be much better? In other words, what specifically makes a lagoon, lake or other bodies of water a good place to form such powerful cities like Venice or Tenochtitlan compared to other places? It's a pros and cons question, basically. 

This is an economy question. Basically, there has to be an incentive for maintaining the colony, just like there are for nation states (national pride, safety, welfare from the state and many other things I can't think of) and incentives for people to personally better themselves. This is not an easy question though, I would argue you're very close to the holy grail of economics; how do we make people produce stuff we need indefinitely, so there's never any recession because the consumer demand is always high enough to put the producers to work and there's never any starvation because the producers always live up to the consumers basic expectations ("starvation" being applied loosely, meaning a child who doesn't get any adequate entertainment for example is starving). You have to make the colonists work give them dopamine or constantly make them confront the consequences of not working enough (people were in contact with death multiple times during foraging times) or the society is going to fall apart. 

I've read some conflicting theories regarding ancient atmosphere (some say it had more oxygen, but others dispute it) being relevant to survival of large dinosaurs. So my question is: is it realistic, from the point of view of known science to have Cretaceous Period dinosaur alive today? (Assuming it was successfully brought over somehow, maybe in a large time-truck) 

There are so many ways to incite rebellion, but in general find out what people are most fearful or angry about and who they are suspicious of, then blame the latter for the former, while insinuating that the government is protecting them. If you want them to be less evil and go after the government directly it could be harder depending on what sort of the reputation the leaders have, sometimes oppressive people are popular (ex. Vladimir Putin). There probably needs to be more information to really provide a detailed answer, but other common tactics include provocations, sabotage, pretending to be the rightful king or queen, accusing the ruling class of having a different religion or not believing in the dominant one, accusing then of not being real members of the nation (if they have some foreign parentage) 

There are a couple of approaches. First you don't want the trees growing too close to the city/castle, so making the land difficult to root in key. Put rocks and salt in a nice wide ring around an area. Second, if certain forests are suspected of being especially dangerous use a parasite to weaken them, something like a pine beetle should do. Although that could make high quality wood harder to acquire so probably keep that as last resort. In a pinch though, burning tar or oil would be the way go as it's nice and sticky so can burn the three for a while, if nothing else it'll force them to disperse or risk forest fire 

A portion of the population will survive but the likelihood of a large portion of the population surviving is very low. Even with outside help in today's world populations suffer great duress. The Swiss will have themselves and their very modern world will work against them as this infrastructure requires a global economy to endure the crisis. Precious metals in manufacturing, petroleum for water pumping and lubrication of hydroelectric generators, shortages of pharmaceuticals and potable water contamination will lead to millions of deaths and great suffering for those unlucky enough to survive. 

Failure Scenario - Lack of Water Both water cooled reactor types suffer cataclysmic failure due to a lack of water. Some reactors can be more robust than others depending on the design. Many reactors derive their cooling water directly from their environment using ocean, lake or river water. These reactors are prone to having their water intake ducts clogged with debris thereby restricting the flow of cooling water to their segregated cooling systems. A lack of human intervention in these reactor types can lead to failure. Cooling towers are used with reactors that are not in close proximity to ocean, river and lake water. Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant in Arizona is one such example as was Three Mile Island. In the event of an overheating reactor in the United States the Federal Government only requires a 30 day supply of cooling water. This cooling water, called a UHS (Ultimate Heat Sink) is a finite source and dissipates over time due to a number of reasons including evaporation, steam release and lack of re-circulation of primary cooling circuits due to radiation (the water for cooling is used one time only, in some cases, due to the amount of radiation contamination of the water) As the water supply for cooling dwindles and water pressure decreases enough for flow rates to diminish beyond preset thresholds, the reactor undergoes an automatic shutdown called a SCRAM. A SCRAM event does not require electricity. Neutron absorbing control rods are held in place by electromagnets above the fissile pile and upon loss of electricity the electromagnets lose their magnetism and the rods are dropped into place bringing fission to a near halt in the core. These systems are automated and do not require human intervention, however, the continued decay heat of the fissile material continues to create issues with cooling and with a finite water supply, eventually, the reaction pile becomes exposed to air which cannot cool the fissile rods due to simple lack of density. At this point water changes it's state to a gas and becomes steam. The heat increases further and more steam and pressure buildup in the chamber. Water becomes superheated and takes on properties and attributes more akin to an organic solvent. The pressure is so high within the chamber that it eventually prevents the water from boiling. This superheated water's hydrogen bonds are eventually broken and the chamber becomes filled with superheated highly pressurized hydrogen which eventually explodes due to combustion or the failure of the reactor pressure vessel to contain the extremely high pressures. This failure has been made famous by the hydrogen explosion at the Fukushima Daiichi reactor containment vessels in Japan due to the tsunami which did not damage the reactors, it damaged generators that prevented the circulation of water for the cooling systems. The loss of integrity to the reaction chamber is the penultimate step to the catastrophe, all systems are essentially destroyed and now the fissile material can become molten and eventually melt through any concrete casements that require cooling features in order to prevent the molten nuclear pile from actually melting through it. Once this molten pile of nuclear material hit's moisture an explosion can occur sending nuclear debris into the atmosphere and contaminating the surround landscape with fallout. Mind you, this isn't a nuclear explosion it's just an explosion....but you see what the problem is here, it's called a meltdown. Conclusion Water inlets that use water from the environment (rivers, lakes, oceans) for secondary cooling systems require regular maintenance to prevent debris from clogging their inlets. US located closed loop cooling reactors require only 30 days of backup cooling water. Manual events such as steam or pressure release to prevent containment vessel explosions won't be occurring. There are disaster prevention events that require human intervention. See this IAEA root cause analysis document and salivate over it's plethora of manual events and whether staff followed procedure and a logical decision tree before, during and after a disaster. I will close this scenario with, there's nuclear waste all over the place. Other Failure Scenarios There are hundreds of nuclear reactors across the world. Educational and research reactors are sprinkled across the topography of nations. Some are mercury and graphite cooled. Others use molten salts and even molten sodium. Fast reactors requires considerable human intervention and are used primarily in naval ship propulsion and in some cases the production of electricity in Russia. There are a plethora of scenarios where these reactor types can go bad in their own unique and beautiful ways. All in all in this scenario that I put forth is feared. There are many other failure points that I have failed to mention. The list is too long and nuanced. With the framework you have presented. Here is the official US Government Nuclear Reactor Regulation Response Plan to Pandemic Notice the emphasis on staff and staff skills and manning the facility to prevent failure. With all the dead engineers it will be difficult to staff these facilities, chaos will ensue attempting to man the reactors as they slowly begin to fail one by one. So to answer your question again. Yes, the landscape is scattered with nuclear debris. 

It's a staple in tabletop RPGs: "Long ago, the guilds ran everything, but then [insert event] made the people form a more centralized government". I want to make a medieval fantasy city-state civilization that is a satire of corporations, in that there is no central government only guilds, but I always get stuck because I have a hard time understanding who would make sure bridges go up, pavements are maintained and the that the water is running and healthy. I don't want a council who is recognized by the guilds, because that's too centralized, but more occasional coalitions between a few of the guilds that are done to complete certain projects. So, to focus it on one question, how would very expensive projects that need more resources than any one guild or individual is prepared to spend be financed in this anarcho syndacalism? Defense, aqueducts and pavements are very long term investments but a huge incentive for people to chose a city to live in, so everyone would agree it's important, but how would they pay for it? There are enornmous power gaps in this city. The mages who are specialized in creating magic items are the most wealthy guild in terms of revenue but they are dependant on other guilds for resources to make the items, defense and many other things like any other economy.
