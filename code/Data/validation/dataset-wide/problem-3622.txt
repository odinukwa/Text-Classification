The risks of not taking a multi-vitamin supplement are the same as if you are deficient in those vitamins. The most common problems that both my wife and I experienced in our low carb weight loss journey when we were not faithful with the supplements were: 

Since you felt no adverse affects, the short answer is no you were not working out too long. You were still moving as well as you normally do. 

Most beginners and early intermediates are really held back by the first two bullets. Improving those will probably have the most impact on your bench press as of right now. That said, when you are staying clean and keeping off "gear" (as the steroid using community likes to call it), be careful not to test your max all the time. Strength is built in the 70-85% range. By that, I mean most of your reps are 70-85% of your 1 rep max. Just to give you an idea of what that means when you don't know your 1 rep max: 

You won't notice it immediately. However, if you have a higher protein diet, the extra calcium will help your body digest that protein better. One of the side effects of higher protein content in your meals is that your body can start leeching calcium from your bones. Don't go above the recommended dosages though. 

Do this routine 3x a week, and do something cardiovascular for 20 minutes a day. That can be running on a treadmill, riding a bike, swimming, running outside, playing basketball, doing some form of aerobics. The choice really is yours, and having a variety of activities will help you from getting bored with one of them. About the pullups: you might not be able to do them right away. If you can, great. However, if you can't do a pull up, start with the inverted rows until you can do 3 sets of 15 reps (3x15). From there, you should be able to follow Scooby's advice on building up your first sets of pull ups and chin ups. If you don't have a bar you can hang from, you can at least do inverted rows using a table--just make sure it can support your weight. The idea behind the full body work to get rid of belly fat is the fact you have to get rid of overall fat. The best way to do that is to increase your muscle mass. At only 56 kg, your belly fat shouldn't be too bad so a recomposition like this should be very possible. Strength training has also been shown to improve mental health, so that should help with programming. 

The best I can do is provide some general advice, since I'm missing detail and I'm not a physical therapist. If you have pain working your abdominals, it is typically unusual to have pain in your lower back. You'll want to make sure of the following things: 

First: celiac disease is an autoimmune response to consuming gluten which is found in wheat flour and certain other grains. Whey protein, eggs, casein etc. do not contain any gluten whatsoever. By definition it can't be celiac disease. However, your symptoms are consistent with an allergic reaction to something in the ingredients for Dymatize Elite. The most likely culprit would be the whey protein itself (concentrate still contains a decent amount of lactic acid which many people have problems processing). I would recommend discontinuing use of whey protein immediately. Try to get your protein requirements from regular food. If you still need a supplement, then consider the following alternatives: 

Creatine naturally exists in animal protein sources, so it will be effective as long as you are creatine deficient. The perceived benefit of creatine will lessen as you reach the levels your body needs. Summary of points from Creatine: Side Effects, What it is, What it does: 

Intense pain is an indication of injury. The biggest risks for people who come back after an extended layoff is usually (in order of decreasing likelihood): 

You can look up the ingredients on Examine.com (a web site that reviews scientific studies in relation to supplements and summarizes them in one place), but I can summarize what most of the ingredients are: 

Summary Hopefully these tips will help you figure out what's going wrong, and fix it. Keep your motivation up, and give yourself more than just one way of tracking progress. You'll find that the progress is happening, but for whatever reason it's not quite the way you were thinking. The body is a very complex system, and every step you take to get a bit stronger and closer to the 10-15% body fat goal (for men, the equivalent for women would be a bit higher), the healthier it will be. 

The purpose of going below parallel is to strengthen the posterior chain. It gets your hamstrings and calf muscles involved, preventing strength imbalances between the front and back of your legs. This of course, is what strengthens the knee. Don't be afraid of increasing the weight you do beyond 5kg. You can use kettlebells or dumbbells to get heavier weights on the goblet squat. Eventually, you can graduate to back squats or front squats for even stronger knees and core. Just make sure your increases are around 5-10lbs (2.5-5kg). 

Based on what I was able to find, the answer is "it depends". Rhabdomyolosis can carry with it damage to the kidneys or other systemic problems. If that is the case, then it is possible that the threshold of what caused the condition is lowered. Now the risk factors for Rhabdo are: 

Finally, just a note that one day of eating a lot of calories or fasting isn't going to make a permanent change to your body composition. It takes several days/weeks to see any real change in body composition. 

The health concerns usually revolve around the level of fructose more than glucose. For example fructose malabsorption is fairly common. Most commonly, the biggest concern is a link between fructose and visceral fat levels. Visceral fat is the fat below the muscle surface packed between your organs. Too much visceral fat will cascade into several health disorders. This is primarily a concern because we have radically increased our fructose intake from 1970 to 2000. As with all things dietary, too much of any one thing is not healthy. Your diet should be very balanced. 

Basically, this describes Skim Chocolate Milk very well. Mix a batch with the creatine powder for your pre/intra workout and have some plane after training. Also, make sure you account for that in your total calorie intake. You can set your daily intake a little lower, and use the pre/intra/post workout to boost the calories where you need them. The goal here is to provide the protein and energy when your body is most prepared to do something with it. 

I realize it is anecdotal evidence, but when you have power lifters in there 70s and 80s still pulling heavy (like a John Bourgoin from Canada's powerlifting federation), you don't have to let age deter you. I know of one 63 year old power lifter in New Zealand who still feels as if he's making good gains. Recovery will become more of an issue the older you get. The big difference between a young guy in their 20s and 30s and an older guy is how soon they need to change to slower progression. If you were to employ some of Wendler's philosophy where you have four lifts a week (squat, bench, deadlift, overhead press), make increases and have a deload week once a month, you can leverage that approach for quite some time. Essentially, on Wendler's 5-3-1 plan, you keep making increases until you start stalling. Once you start stalling, take 90% of your current max and work your way back up. I also know of an ex-military lifter in his 50s who when he was told he should consider taking disability due to his acute back pain, made some positive changes and is seriously quite an impressive guy. He now favors high volume training such as the Sheiko programs. His basic philosophy is that he's done chasing max effort numbers, and is simply seeing how many times he can hit his current maxes. Some of the guys I referred to can be found at the IronStrong.org forums, but the bottom line is that you can continue to make increases for quite some time. All the tools to manage recovery are all there. You won't be able to do linear progression as well, but you sound like you are past that stage anyway. 

Since you said you had it checked out: I hate to say it, but one of the best exercises for your knees is the squat. I'd check out this video with Mark Rippetoe (a respected coach) for good information on proper form to get the most out of it. That said:
