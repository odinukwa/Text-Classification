I also have had varying levels of rotator cuff pain over the years. Most of the time for me its been from bad technique on bar bell bench press, or dumbbell shoulder/bench press movements. There are many ways you can isolate and train (very carefully!) these muscles. I have always found a pain free shoulder strengthening exercise to be the seated barbell military press. I don't really like the smith machine version but that can be a way to start and learn the movement. Give it a try and see if it works for you. I've built up the strength in my shoulders substantially doing seated military press and rotator cuff pain has diminished and largely disappeared. I've also used this method sporadically throughout the years. I must admit I've been a bit lazy with it though but see how you go with it. Its the one generally recommended by most personal trainers whenever you mention rotator cuffs. More to your question on dips, they can be a bit tricky as muscles utilised can change (as you've identified) depending on your posture during the movement. If you want to strengthen your triceps for dips, I would recommend replicating a similar (but more controlled movement) in the rope pushdown. Hope that helps. 

I have successfully reduced my body fat from 15% to 8.5%. Keep in mind these are pinch tests so the over all body fat calculated percentage might be a bit off. My abdominal skin fold measures 7.1mm. I eat 3000 calories a day and whenever I try reduce this, I lose muscle (which results in an identical or worsened overall body fat percentage). Its almost as if my body doesn't want to lose any more fat. I don't do ANY cardio - just hard & heavy (to me at least) weight training 4 or 5 times a week. What cardio should I try putting in (assuming that will get me down)? Anyone tried and had success with intermittent fasting? I'm ALMOST happy with my physique. I would hate to come all this way and not achieve a full shredded physique. Here is a picture. You can see that blob of fat where the bottom 2 abs should be. 

Generally you'll have to put in enough intensity, volume, and time-under-tension to feel sore the next day. If you're just going light on these, then that's just a lightweight workout you can do everyday. Lots of people go out on a walk and/or a short run on a daily basis too -- it just depends on how hard your workout actually is! 

The way some people do their pullups (there are many variations) can place some rather unique and interesting loads on the traps (even more so sometimes with an added weight belt). Your "pain" is most likely just some tendinitis of the tendon connecting the shoulder blade to the trap muscle. Make sure your traps are really solid and strong before attempting significant loads with pullups exercises. Your traps are here to stabilize the scapulae while you do your pullups --- and, as with many arm exercises, failure to stabilize the shoulder blades can have some pretty nasty consequences. Personally, farmer's walks and weighted vests are my goto for traps strengthening. 

Almost every back anatomy diagram I see draws a giant trapezius muscle across the upper back. I work out frequently and I would say (for my body type/size) I have rather large "upper" traps, but have always wondered about the "lower" parts. It looks like they are always primarily mentioned in the context of scapular "depression". However, I have never "isolated" or purposefully tried to train "lower traps", nor do I feel any "weakness" when trying to depress my scapula manually or when doing exercises (such as weighted dips or pullups) that would make use of any scapular-depression musculature. In other words, I feel no "weakness" in my lower traps when doing exercises involving scapular depression or that seemingly would invoke lower traps for scapular depression or stabilization. So, are strong lower traps really that useful for most exercises? Do they need to be isolated, or are they pretty well invoked in any exercises involving traps anyway?  It seems to me like whatever weaknesses one may have in exercises -- such as dips and pullups -- that should make the most use of scapular depression musculature, the trapezius in general seems like the least likely muscle one would commonly need to strengthen in order to progress in those exercises. 

According to this article, Muscle growth starts about 1 hr after a workout and continues for up to 24 hours. It is important to have sufficient protein and slow release carbs to ensure maximum muscle synthesis. 

Scientific evidence seems to suggest that nutrition timing is NOT as important as most think. Most of the "common knowledge" surrounding this is based on statistics that show correlations. With plenty of ulterior causations to choose from (e.g. those snacking at night are more likely to get fat because they are eating more food overall), there is no point changing behaviour based on this. There is NO real evidence that if eating a controlled diet, nutrition timing does much at all. Our bodies adapt to whatever we throw at it. Its the daily macronutrient totals that are important. You will find this article very interesting. 

The exercise famous for being hard on the knees is the leg press - not squat. If the squat is done with the correct depth (hip lower than the knee) so that the change of direction is NOT done while the knees are at right angles, it shouldn't hurt the knees. If you get some soft knee wraps you might be able to convince her to squat with those. If not - I would highly recommend lunges holding dumbbells. They train similar muscles. 

YES!! YES! YES! HIIT is now the industry standard for safe and highly effective fat loss whilst conserving muscle mass. Any strength coach worth his salt will prescribe it to natural athletes looking to lose fat without going through the stupidity and pointlessness of regular cardio. A couch potato's initial "high"-intensity in the first week will be the laughing stock of his/her future self. Your first "high" intensity session will be you lumbering along wheezing and panting. The good news is that our body is an amazing adaptive organism. Your heart rate will be more or less the same even as you get more and more powerful and strong. Thats the beauty of HIIT cardio. As your body adapts to be a more efficient powerful machine, you get more out of your hearts BPM. If your BPM is dropping over the coming weeks, then your intensity (speed) isn't building. 

I'm no expert in glenohumeral anatomy, but I've noticed that if I do "triceps-style" bar dips, I have no pain nor impingement in the shoulder joint whatsoever. This is the version of dips where the elbow go as far back as possible, almost as if they're trying to touch one another, as opposed to "chest-style" bar dips, where the elbows are much more flared out to the sides. But, taking a look at the skeletal structures of the shoulder joint, I see no reason why moving the humerus "backwards", as opposed to just flaring it out to the sides, should somehow make the movement a lot more impingement-less (mainly across the AC joint, which seems to be the most likely source of impingement). Granted, a simple "skeletal/ligament" view may omitting some other important detail as well --- if my elbow is pointed backwards (with scapulae retracted), I can move the elbow upwards only so far (I cannot raise my elbow above my shoulder joint when it's pointed behind me, for example). So, are there actually other structures in place (e.g., muscle tissue) that could be keeping 'triceps' dips from hurting the shoulder joint? My best guess so far is just deltoids, traps, and the long triceps head simply all bumping into each other thereby blocking any pain-causing or impingement-causing ranges of motion. Edit: According to the image below, what exactly prevents sagittal shoulder extension a full 360°? Is it the stretching of the deltoids, or some occlusion between the rear muscle groups bumping into one another, or something else? Since whatever it is, it allows me to do triceps dips comfortably with no pain or impingement whatsoever. 

Add to that a quality fish oil, a multivitamin, and probiotics for digestive health. All weights are uncooked and 'meat' refers to anything lean (chicken breast skinless, lean beef mince, tuna, etc). Veggies excludes potatoes - just stick to green fibrous like broccoli. Protein powder must be low carb as possible (no sugar). Drink plenty of water (at least 3.5 litres) but not on top of a stomach full of food! Remember, its mostly about FOOD. As well as all this, you should be training about 3 or 4 times a week and HARD. Train every set to failure. Record your reps/weights and ensure you are always adding reps or weights (ever increasing intensity). There is a lot more to it all but this will be a good start. 15-20 reps on the compounds like squats and deadlifts will burn the most fat whilst growing (or at least maintaining) muscle. Forget cardio - and forget situps. It sounds like you already have a grasp on listening to your body. At first you will feel like you are forcing food in and intuitively you will feel like you are eating too much. This will quickly change as your metabolism gets up a gear. You will enjoy sustained energy levels throughout the day. Good luck. 

With the other nonsense removed, all we have left is to gain some muscle. You may want to stop gaining muscle when you reach your 'aesthetic' ideal. Great. You will have PLENTY of time to stop as gaining muscle does not happen overnight - or without hard work. Actively aim to lift MORE every set. More reps or more weight. If you aren't lifting more in any way (reps/weight) then assume you haven't grown muscle and immediately take a good hard look at your diet (are you eating enough?) or your intensity (are you really pushing yourself to the max). Remember, to put on muscle you need to become a bigger, stronger version of your current self. Your stronger future self will be capable of lifting a lot more than you are lifting now. Break this ultimate goal into smaller goals (rep/weight targets). If you are lifting to failure your reps will look something like 12,10,8,6. If you have been capable of doing 4 sets of 12 it means you were really lazy on the first 2 sets (or perhaps too preoccupied counting the time it takes to rep up and down). Advice 

See "Triceps" dips completely alleviate shoulder pain? regarding shoulder pain on dips. My advice is to maintain humeral external rotation (not sure what the official name is) whenever doing any exercises either pulling or pushing the humerus "upwards" into the shoulder (glenohumeral) joint (such as dips and pullups). Also use your traps to stabilize your shoulder blades as needed for these well. 

Sounds to me like you just have to increase the weight -- I mean, go even for sets of heavy singles with weight belt if you have to for that as well. The issue is not that pullups don't "target tht lats" -- they do, but lats are generally going to be the strongest muscles in that whole chain anyway. Since yours are strong enough already for bodyweight, it makes sense that you won't feel them being worked as much as the weaker muscles in that chain (such as elbow flexors and grip muscles in the arms). (The purpose of heavy singles is to workaround any weaknesses or lack of endurance in those weaker non-lat muscles). If, on the other hand, you're just seeking to do "more" pullups per set, then that will be more of an "endurance" (or technically, "time-under-tension") exercise. And consequently, those weaker muscles are really going to be hit hard going for that -- much more so than the already strong and stable lats. Edit: to be fair, assuming you're not talking about "kipping pullups, then some more time-under-tension handling would be critical here -- essentially to take the time to inhibit swinging and do pullups more strictly (kipping pullups limit time-under-tension to permit more reps). 

I appreciate that you are new to lifting weights etc - but let me save you years of wasted workouts by blowing apart some common myths you have referred to. 

To answer your question, straight sugar is high in calories but low in fat. Its high in simple carbohydrates. That said, I'm not sure the advice you read was so great. It likely comes from the outdated belief that dietary fat/cholesterol equals fat/cholesterol in your body. Eat too much of any of the 3 macronutrient categories (protein/fat/carbohydrate) and you will get fat. Eating huge amounts of simple carbohydrates and the associated sustained high blood glucose levels over a long period of time can put a strain on your pancreas and in some cases lead to diabetes, varying levels of insulin resistance, and arterial plaque. If you want to put on weight, you have to decide what kind of weight you want to put on. If you want to put on fat, the best way to do that is just to eat lots of food with little or no exercise. If you have a normal digestive system then there is always a point at which your body fails to burn all the calories you consume, and you put on fat. If you have a faster metabolism than average, this will be more food than others eat. If you want to put on muscle, then you have to train hard in the gym whilst eating lots of quality food. I hope that answers your question. 

For normal people, a diet high in protein is NOT harmful. Its beneficial. High protein keeps you feeling full longer. Contrary to what I've read on this forum, your body can utilise (for energy, muscle growth) as much protein as you throw at it per meal. It is a great food for sustained energy levels throughout the day. A high protein (up to 50%) diet is popular with athletes around the world. As for protein in powder form, yes there have been some heavy metals found in them. Some fish also has this. Long story short, there is nothing magical about whey proteins so if you have any health concerns, eat more chicken/beef/eggs instead! Here is a great article from a very well-respected natural body builder (and power lifter) that did his PHD in protein metabolism.
