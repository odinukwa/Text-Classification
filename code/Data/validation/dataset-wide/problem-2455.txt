Tibetan Buddhism has practice based on Amitabha, and very high level of visualization meditation related to Amitabha (very few got such knowledge) - correct me if I missed something. All cultivation the fruition must come through some form of Dhyana (Pali: Jhana), even dealing Koan the mind must be in a state of Dhyana so that the clarity of mind be obtained to see beyond the conceptual contriving. Therefore the real Pure Land practice is a Dhyana practice, in short. However, I cannot know what you saw of that local group, since most of the real Buddhist practices are done in the wrong way the meanings are lost these days. Pure Land the practice method is generally called 念佛 (Niànfó, Japanese: Nembutsu). The real meaning of this character 念, is remembering, or recollecting, even with a sense of missing (missing like missing someone dear to you, here the dear one is Buddha Amitabha, in simplicity). This remembering most common expression is by chanting the name. Chanting can be a loud chanting, or chanting for your own self to hear, or chanting in your heart silently. By this very method, the practitioner's thoughts (fetters) are abandoned, focusing only on ONE thought, that is Amitabha. He should chant and hear his own chant, he should "lose" himself, the chanter and chanting becomes one... This the most effective for modern man to achieve Dhyana, since human faculty in general is in declining cycle from the Buddha's time. Of course there are exceptions. More sophisticated practice is related to visualization meditation, taught in Amitāyurdhyāna-sūtra, of 16 scenes. Each of these scenes has profound effect, and meaning. A related post is here. There are more important Sutras related to Pure Land, also the higher meanings, however it seems here to keep this simple is just right. Often time, Ch'an (Japanese: Zen) may incorporate Pure Land, or vice versa. 

Becoming sensitive/ kind to all forms of life is the sign you are walking the path :). Deeds speak louder than rhetoric, those clever minds learnt the letters only; true Dharma followers learnt the teachings of Buddha, including the teachings of Karma and Rebirth in Buddha's original meaning. When you treat them with kindness, they return you with kindness. My place was savoured by ants when I just moved in, I didn't kill them but drove them away or let them be if not too troublesome, they started to decrease. Once I was peeling a pear near the sink the peels and some juices fell onto the worktop, immediately ants coming like people going for party and feast. Suddenly I realized our small castaway could be a treasure vault for another lifeforms... So I started to bestow my presents to ants - literally :]. I'll leave the used sugar bag on the worktop the ants will clean the leftover spotlessly, it's a great amusement and feels some accomplishment for having treating the ants. Since all these measures they seem just appearing occasionally in untroublesome way. I learnt that ants are very tidy and sanitary conscious little creatures, so I'm not disliking them. For roaches I learnt from Chinese Buddhist sites that you can use empty mineral water bottle for example. Roll newspaper in cone shape, insert the smaller end into the bottle, inside the bottle put bit of bacon or smelly food, lay the bottle flat on floor or where they like to cross, tip the newspaper touching ground so they can crawl in. The roaches will be drawn by the smell they will enter the bottle via the wider end of newspaper; since roaches are blind they can only detect light they won't be able to find the exit, which is high in the mid-air inside the bottle. Once you collect enough of them, take them to release in appropriate environment, such as rubbish collecting point away from neighborhood. I tried once or twice it works, I caught one or two, maybe I didn't put in smelly enough food since I was trying to go against meat 1st by not buying raw meat, I didn't use bacon but certain Thai style fish favoured chips instead; also there was one or two of them only that I saw. 

First of all, "mind" here cannot be directly replaced by one Buddhist terminology. We are trying to get sensible knowledge from two different systems, literally, a goat's respiratory activity with an orange's. 

I do not understand if it's Tibetan Buddhism saying lower, middle, or greater yanas, or only Tibetan Buddhism only. Reference to the Chinese Sutras I studied, it would be Śrāvaka, Bodhisattva and Buddha yanas. Or sometimes five yanas: Śrāvaka, Arhat, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva and Buddha. These yanas are depending on the nature/inclination of the students that they naturally choosing their vehicles. In general, Sravaka, Arhat and Pratyekabuddha responding to life as an abode to be escaped from, their main concern is a jailbreak, or liberation. But the Bodhisattva and Buddha are liberation and enjoyment, or total mastery. All yanas have happy ending, just that they have different taste buds, like some people like beer, some wine, some whisky... :) So this is not the Buddha be partial or judgemental, just providing all different drinks for all different drinkers that pleased the most their taste buds. It wouldn't be a good bar if only offering one type of drink, huh? 

Other passive method is to scent your home, sandalwood or cedar etc., those fragrant smells are toxic and repellent to most insects. Still less known way is to use Mantra, this required certain merit and ability that the practitioner accomplished, Puan Mantra is very well known for Chinese Buddhists. 

The Buddha concluded that with the body confinement we could perform 4 activities and only: 1)walk 行; 2)stand 住; 3)sit 坐; 4)recline 卧. Each of these activities can be used to practice each of the foundations of mindfulness. However, I found that Mindfulness of Dharma could conveniently be applied when one is engaging in daily going-by, whilst mindful of breathing is harder. 

Offer a direct and an answer based on economy/profit & loss: every time you let lust take over yourself, you lose your vital energy/ life force. When humans are born in this world, they take with them the amount of life force in full, over the time, this life force burning up bits by bits, until it's depleted a human dies. The most activity that consumed the most of energy is related to lust. That's why the highest of the energy release could produce another life: offspring. When a thought of lust arose, it triggers the pituitary, this comes along the path down through the spine, to the bottom of the body its reproduction system. When this life force is in it's original form, it doesn't take a form, the Ancient Chinese called "Shen" (神), when it takes the form of energy, its called "Qi" (氣/炁) (maybe call "Prana" by the Brahmanic/Vedic?), when it becomes the material our worldly method could measure, called "Jing" (精). That's why the semen is called "Jing Ye", namely, the liquidized Jing. Now you know that every time there lust arises, you lose your energy. You don't want to waste your energy on something unproductive, something that actually is taking out to spend from your "Life Bank", right? The media promoting sex and lust for health, for wealth, or for any god-knows-goodies are lying, stealing your life force so that they converted it into the money, i.e., they ripped off your life force so that they become more powerful. (Yeah, the cosmos when it's in form, it's about the consuming of the non-Me, so that the strong one will become the dominate. This is playing out in the galactic systems, star systems, black hole and supernova... etc.. The Act of Devouring is not just on the level of Eating.) That's why Buddha given the rules to the Bhukikus one is of celibacy, this not only for leading a pristine life, it helps to reserve the life force, in turn this life force will be all directed to enlightenment. Enlightenment also needs the fuel of life force/ energy, meditation in it's lotus prose (cross-legs) is the best way to preserve, re-direct, re-generate this life force. 

I personally do not echo with breathing meditation, I prefer visualizing. For visualization there is one called Greater Illumination, with mudras, images, music, and accompanied verbal instruction. Though this society is somehow in certain controversy. The other is visualizing the Tangka, an instruction given by 慈誠羅珠堪布 (Tibetan monk, Rinpoche) in Mandarin. Basically 1st start with observing the Tangka in details, then observe the Tangka in your mind in details, without the actual Tangka. Last is the step by step instruction given by the Buddha in 《禪祕要法經》 (sutra related to White Skeleton Meditation), from visualizing the skin, then the fat, the flesh... from swollen... rotten, fell off... muscle, tendon... all the internal organs... rotten and fell off... remained the skeleton; then the bones between moved apart, joining with white lights... more wide apart with more white lights... all bones emitting white lights... disintegrated and disappeared... That's the very very rough scratchy remembrance of the content... It warned that during this practice, to a stage, a nursing person should be presented, for when the visualization goes to the depth and becomes vivid, it could be a life danger for the practitioner, he may become weak (imaging one's body disintegrated). Proper nutritions must be provided in a certain stage. 

Your question is, animal and plant, both are lives, if killing animal is an offence why not killing a plant? 1) Animal has feeling of pain, plant has feeling but it's not the same as pain to animal. Meditate: why some plants grow fruits for animals to eat to propagate? Is the fruit "painful" when being eaten? 2) Plant is also life, thus the monks are taught not to step on the grass if they could avoid; the summer retreat is also one reason to avoid destroying the flourishing plants in a season of growth. But plant life is different from animal life: grasses trod, will continuous to grow afterwards, even stronger; a tree when a branch is chopped, will regrown, or split from the cut more branches... 3) The plant in the Cycle of Life the only mean is to offer itself to accumulate merits for enlightenment, since it's not able to act (immobile) nor speak. Meditate on this... 4) A log after chopped down (a tree's life is ended in a simple sense however, the roots are deep buried some could spring to life again. But it's different the modern way of timbering I don't know, for the modern way tends to uproot everything and take it all), is it going to die spilling blood and rotten like an animal carcass? No. Normally a log could last for thousands of years if it's not attacked by bugs or mold. Some logs may appear even more polished or with fragrance if it's aged. In contrast, a tree may be attacked by bugs or molds or even ivies while still "alive". Thus we cannot determine what is "death" to a tree like defining an animal. I'm sure if I'm a log being crafted into a Buddha image and adorned in the temple I'm "happier" than exposed in the forest ;) Meditate: the bees' world view - social structure, individuality? Sure it's different from human; thus the plant's is different. 5) Buddha did instruct the students not to wear fur, leather or silk (from the cocoon of silkworm) clothes in Surangama Sutra, if they wish to have clean practice. It's important to grasp the core idea of having loving-kindness to all beings. However to sustain a body that's conditioned with material, we can't avoid taking material from around. Thus we shall vow to become enlightened quickly, to end this dependency. Before that's achieved, we shall opt for the minimum of harm and consumption. 

The Diamond Sutra in Classical Chinese, wherein one of the verses instantly enlightened the 6th Patriarch Huineng, the corresponding verse to your quote is this: 

Wow, I'll leave this to later maybe, since my answer is so long now, and not sure if I could produce an accurate answer... I'm reading the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra and Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, hopefully I could come up with some more "prajna" to answer your question ;]. 

Buddha told the woman who's only son died to beg for some mustard seeds from a family who never had anyone died to make medicine to feed her dead son so he could become alive. (Didn't the Buddha know it's futile and absurd? But he told her to do so.) Rahula when first admitted in the Samgha, taking privilege of he the Buddha's son, always spoke misleadingly to make fun of others. In order to teach him, one day the Buddha told him to wash his feet with a wooden bowl. After done, the Buddha told him to drink the water in the bowl, Rahula gaped. Then Buddha's teaching stroke in, telling him speaking misleadingly was unwholesome like asking someone to drink that water... [in Madhyamāgama] 

Purely a personal opinion, the Theravada School is incomplete, from a Buddhist practitioner's point of view. To remark is, especially if one reading articles on the internet in English about the Theravada School's teaching based on many Pali translated English (modern) Sutras formed the view believed that's what Buddha taught, they could be inaccurate; upto this moment these views and the analogies behind them have a lot to be examined and verified, or even updated. 

"one with everything", do you mean one eternal self for every one of us, i.e., we are all one eternal self; if everyone enlightened, i.e., there will only be one thing left, the eternal self? Since not familiar with Advaita concept thus ask for clarification. 

When one contemplate the Hinderance of Greed: Greed is always unsatisfiable, not because of lack, it's the unsatisfiable-ness, wanting more that we called greed, so even there's plenty, to the greed it still means lack, needs more. This unsatifiable-ness backfires caused actualizing their lack-ness: needle mouth, over-short hands, no lips. When this mental state becomes the dominate it will manifest as a physical form that match such mental state. All forms are the manifestation of corresponding consciousness (consciousness is not really an exact term but can't think up better one yet). Animal form is animal consciousness, human form human consciousness. Beware and condemn those Neo-Buddhism followers those have an apetite for twisting the Dharma/Dhamma and fitting it into their self-invented "self-views". If an animal mental state is a self-view of a human how does the existence of animal realm exist in our world? It's ludicrous for those clever men taking a literal term "mental state" treating like a real Buddhist doctrine. 

I will provide a hint to your question grossly, since I'm running out of time. Provided chance, I shall attend to this question if needed. 

You have asked a very good question, I remembered if correctly it's in the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment Maitreya Bodhisattva asked similar question: 以幻修幻 - how can if phenomenal world is illusory construct and the "I" is also illusory that a practitioner realize the Ultimate Truth? I remember the Buddha answered 以幻修真 - using the illusory to rid the illusion, as if using a wedge to get out another wedge stuck in the hole. Therefore, I think to give some help of your inquiry is to think of: your volition is to get over ignorance by choosing actions of not ignorant... You find that the action that is not ignorant is still an ignorant action... so on and so forth. Until you finally know the action that is not ignorant, that you are enlightened. It could be a long practice, or it could be a sudden realization. A bit like someone doing a difficult math equation, volition discerns the answers are not correct, over and over, that the working out incorrect answers are the footings to finally have the correct answer. Volition the ability to discern doesn't get hindered by ignorance, although ignorance prevented it from knowing the correct answer immediately. The Sutra has very good analogy full of wisdom far better than I presented here, I just recalled to make an answer in convenience. I hope I didn't misunderstand your question, and I'm not quite familiar with the terms and the Suttas mentioned in the OP.
