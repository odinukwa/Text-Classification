Click for larger image What did he whisper? At first I thought it would be "I love you", because he's a romantic, but then I realised they'd already exchanged those words; another secret I can think of is the details of his deal with Death, but he'd explained those as well by that time. What else could he have said? (Scott McCloud talks about this scene briefly in this interview (obvious spoilers), but he doesn't reveal what David said) 

Friction acts on the book regardless of whether it's fixed or not. If a bag doesn't have a special compartment for books of laptops, it may be beneficial to acquire a book cover. It can be plastic, paper, or even textile, depending only on one's choice Plastic covers (also called wraps) seem to be available online (e.g. I took the picture above from here). One could fashion a custom book cover from plastic (here's a tutorial), or from paper (which is easier). The advantage here is customisable size. A cover offers some advantages for book protection: 

(emphasis mine) In this passage, it is discussing how the role of the author in the literary analysis of that time was absolute. However, it refers to "magazine interviews" as being an avenue in which the author's word is absolute. However, at first, I thought this was a weird translation of journal, but in the next line he refers to "their [the literary men's] private journals", which clarified for me that the magazine of "magazine interviews" was not a journal. This led me to wonder whether magazines of that time did serious literary analysis. Did mainstream magazines that Roland Barthes may have read include interviews for the purpose of literary analysis, or only interviews in the modern sense of magazine, author interviews? 

In The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges, the speaker describes the Library, as the universe, as 

This was in response to a request that Emily Grierson pay her taxes, which she claimed she was not obligated to do as a result of a hereditary obligation. How did this obligation originate? 

is simply evil. He simply admits his only goal is world domination, and he won't hesitate to perform vile experiments on young girls to obtain it. Among the cast of other characters, who have personalities and different traits, he seems extremely flat. Why is that? 

Although another theory I just developed (after reading this) is that the heart is related to Desire, but through Koschei. It's simple, and confined to this panel: 

The reason why Abel "sanitised" his story is his audience - a former human now-raven Matthew, and the human boy Daniel (nobody cares about the gargoyle). Quite possibly they wouldn't understand his story if he told it as it was. 

During the dinner at the king's palace, Rumata has a conversation with Father Gur, the poet. Rumata offers him a copy of the poets work, in exchange for a promise to write something new: 

He retains the basic traits, but it becomes harder and harder to identify him with any particular person. 

I think we can reasonably infer that the work Lewis is referring to is The Works of Aristotle the Famous Philosopher, which, per Wikipedia, is a sex manual and book of midwifery, falsely claiming to be the work of Aristotle. In other words, a work of pretentious smut. Just the sort of thing that Lewis liked to rail against. So, the answer is: Smutty bookshops. 

This, allowing for certain changes in rhetorical style over the years, could be Bernie Sanders. Except Bernie Sander would not likely quote Deuteronomy in support of this assertion. 

That is the tale he is planning to tell at parties later in life, but, as the previous lines have made clear, these sentiments are all bosh. There was nothing to choose between the roads and he has no idea if the choice he made made any difference at all. The problem with the poem seems to be that most of the readers get so caught up in the romance of those last lines that they fail to notice the plain statement that they are a piece of humbug. The words "with a sigh", particularly, emphasize the humbug of the words that follow. Why will he sigh? To make his words seem vaguely tinged with regret. It's an act. It is humbug. But we can't see it because we want the particular piece of humbug to be true. We want poems to have poetic ideas and poetic themes and the road less travelled is just what we think a poetic theme should look like. So obviously the poet must have meant those words seriously, and so the rest of the poem -- which if read plain is making it clear that those sentiments are humbug -- becomes difficult and mysterious because the conclusion does not seem to follow from them. Which is, I suppose, as good an illustration of the purpose of literary criticism. Not to elucidate some hidden meaning about forging your own path in life, but to point out that it is, on the plain face of it, describing not some momentous life choice, but the kind of humbug we tell ourselves and our friends about the significance of our choices. 

Many Southern authors of Harper Lee's time period wrote very autobiographical works. This led me to wonder how much Harper Lee's personal life was reflected in the narrative of To Kill A Mockingbird. After some research, I was not able to find much. However, I found some information to suggest that she had lived near an event like the one written about in To Kill A Mockingbird; her father was a lawyer, like Atticus; she was a tomboy, like Scout; and she had a neighbor down the street who left things in trees, similar to what Boo Radley does. I can't find any sources saying that those were the only similarities and I also can't find sources saying there were more similarities. This leads me to ask: How did Lee's personal experience affect the narrative of To Kill A Mockingbird? 

There are a few mentions of Mrs. Jones, primarily in reference to her table cloth. Does she represent something in and of herself? If so, what does Mrs. Jones represent in Animal Farm? 

As seen on this page in the book, Rumata (and, I reason, other operatives) only target people who would immediately be neutralised without operatives' intervention. The whole point here is doing as few interventions as possible, and letting the history take its course. Operatives are mostly observers, and the action part comes later. 

The part about Time is particularly interesting; Time and Night would have to represent some fundamental forces or events, given they're the parents of such fundamental things as the Endless. However, time was described as non-essential or "bendy", in some regions of space, and especially in Dream's realm, in soft places. It wasn't treated as very important, so it seems a bit odd that the entity who fathered Dream is Time. 

Does the heart really belong to Koschei? I don't know. Most probably. But is the heart connected to Desire? Almost certainly. As Neil Gaiman acknowledges later in The Sandman Companion, the moral of "The Hunt" is some dreams (and some desires) should stay dreams (see also What did Vassily see when he looked at the sleeping woman? on SFF): 

The Puritans regarded themselves as representing a purified Christianity and hoped to establish a Christian society free of the corrupting influence of the old world. In doing so, he argues, they take on an exceptional responsibility: the reputation of God and his people throughout the world: 

I think the problem here lies in the distinction between an aphorism and a quotation. An aphorism is a pithy saying meant to express a general truth. We assume that the author of an aphorism believes what they are saying. What we commonly call "quotes" are in fact generally aphorisms. All aphorisms are quotations, of course, but not all quotations are aphorisms. 

He is therefore telling them that they are to be a light to the world. Edit: The exceptionalism here is not American exceptionalism (there was not America at the time), it is Christian exceptionalism. 

My father was a professor of literature and I am reasonably confident that if he were asked this question he would say that the purpose of criticism is not to figure out what the author meant, but to fully understand and appreciate the nature of the experience that the work creates. He spent much of his career arguing for the superiority of the 1850 version of Wordsworth's prelude over the 1805. The 1805 version is considerably more liberal in its sentiments and it was preferred by many of the scholars of the day for that reason -- they considered it to be a better work because it expressed more liberal sentiments compared to the more conservative sentiments of the 1850 version. But my father's argument was not that the 1850 version was better because its politics were more conservative, but that it was better because it was better poetry; that its images were more striking and its emotions both more mature and more deeply felt. (I'm paraphrasing his argument wildly, but that seems to me, through the filter of memory, to be the gist of it.) I also remember an anecdote about Beethoven which I assume I must have heard from him. A woman came up to Beethoven after a concert and asked him what the piece he had just played meant. Beethoven answered by sitting down at the piano and playing it again. A piece of art, in other words, means itself, the totality of its experience, and nothing else. The purpose of criticism is both to judge the quality of the experience as an experience and to make the fullness of the experience more accessible to the reader. Of course, this is not the majority view among literary critics. But to me, the notion of a piece of literature as a covert polemic seems odious. I believe that a writer turns to fiction not to conceal an argument which they are very capable of making plainly, but to record an experience. Sometimes, in other words, what you want to say is not that the world should be such and such, but simply that the world is such and such, not how human life should be lived, but simply what the nature of human experience actually is. Experience, by its nature, cannot be conveyed in summary. It can only be taken whole. The meaning of a poem is the poem. The meaning of a novel is the novel. 

He says basically the same thing in another interview, while reluctantly acknowledging that games did positively influence the sales of the books: 

I cannot say I see Lucifer's point here. In some of the further stories it is shown that Morpheus has lots of work in The Dreaming, and that it doesn't seem to be easy to rule at all. What does Lucifer mean by "A simple place - compared to Hell"? 

Whose idea was it to use the 9-panel grid? It's most likely to be the artist, but Alan Moore is known for his excesisvely detailed comic scripts, and he's usually involved with the artistic process as well. What was the reason for it? E.g. in V for Vendetta David Lloyd, the artist, decided not to have thought baloons or sounds. Just because. Alan Moore had to adapt to that. What is the story behind the 9-panel grid in Watchmen? What purpose does it story, from the point of the story, and the picture? 

I think C.S. Lewis himself gives a fairly exhaustive answer to this question in the The Abolition of Man. Lewis begins the first of the three essays that make up to book by looking at an elementary school textbook and showing how it has broken fundamentally with the entire Western tradition by interpreting a statement such as "the waterfall is sublime" not as an objective and just statement about the waterfall, and instead treating it as an a subjective statement about the observer's feelings. If we view the statement "the waterfall is sublime" as a objective and just statement about the waterfall, that implies that objects in the world deserve a particular kind of response from us and that if we fail to give that response, it is because there is a defect in our appreciation -- a defect which education might seek to cure. This implies a very different view of the relationship between language, thought, and reality than is implied by the idea that calling the waterfall sublime is merely an expression of the observer's feelings. Here language never describes reality at all, it only describes the observer's reactions. Language, and the reading of language, becomes entirely psychologized -- which is pretty much exactly what has happened in the study of literature. And in that environment, what would the place of philology be? 

We never find out if Gulliver is in fact, Christian, but this is the only mention I could find in the book. Do we know whether he was Christian? Does Swift ever mention it in any of his letters? 

I have recently been reading about symbolism and imagism and they seem to me to be connected in that they were in some ways the opposite of each other, one being the movement to add greater symbolic meaning to poetry and the other being a movement to add greater precision in imagery, which is not necessarily non-symbolic. I see ways in which they are both the same and different, but I may be interpreting these wrong. So, what is the distinction between Imagism and Symbolism? How are they related? 

In The Scandal by John Grisham, Theodore Boone finds out that cheating occurred in the administration of annual standardized tests. It is common knowledge that such cheating scandals occur on a fairly regular basis. Is it known whether John Grisham based his cheating scandal in The Scandal on a specific cheating scandal? 

Remembering that Tolkien was Catholic, I would suggest that the meaning is not specifically or simply death, but rather the ability to rest in peace after death -- which in Catholic terms means to be reconciled with God. Thus I think the import of Frodo's question is whether or not Bilbo has been irredeemably corrupted by the ring. Though Bilbo's passage over the sea would constitute his resting in peace, I don't know that I would go so far as to call this a deliberate foreshadowing. It is all too easy to find associations in any text is you look hard enough. I would want foreshadowing to we written in a heavier hand than this before I called it by that name. 

Surely the point is that we don't know. When a civilization ends, what comes next? If the previous civilization began with a birth in Bethlehem, then whatever comes next symbolically repeats the pattern. But when all we see about us is the fall of the old, how would we know what comes next? And so the question: what rough beast?
