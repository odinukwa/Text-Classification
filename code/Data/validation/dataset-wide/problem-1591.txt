The book "Our House Divided: Seven Japanese American Families in World War II" by Tomi Kaizawa Knaefler, published in 1991, had the following: 

Partial answer: Addresses use of "ninja", doesn't address etymology. Several hijab stores refer to a part of the hijab as a ninja, without any sign of being ironic in nature. The page $URL$ for example has in its google web search summary 

A friend of mine in Australia has heard from several of her friends that it's unsafe to pour boiling water on car windows in order to defrost them. Online examples of people claiming it's unsafe include Lifehacker: 

I came across a video titled Hummingbirds drink from red Solo cup in hand, which has over one hundred thousand views, and presumably has been viewed in places other than YouTube. The hummingbirds look very small compared to the "hand" in the video. According to Wikipedia, the smallest hummingbird is 5 cm long at adulthood. Also, the "hand" moves up and down, but the "fingers" don't move at all relative to the hand. Is the hand fake, as opposed to a real human hand? 

However, the newspaper article is too tabloid to be regarded as reliable. A Twitter search for Taiwan gambling die isn't giving many, if any, news articles subsequent to the initial allegations. If the government investigated the claims, and found sufficient evidence to prosecute, and that prosecution got covered by English language media, you'd get more recent matches in Twitter. This is looking somewhat doubtful. 

Wikipedia mentions this, but it cites a newspaper article for support, which isn't a reliable enough reference for this claim. TV Tropes is skeptical of this belief, and related versions. It explicitly states that some people are of the belief that testing for witchcraft involved the suspect either drowning and being declared innocent posthumously, or floating and being executed for witchcraft, and describes that belief as erroneous. It also says ducking chairs aren't involved. Unfortunately, TV Tropes isn't a sufficiently reliable source. 

In The Killer Hiding in the CDC Map, it's alleged the CDC knows what caused the Haiti cholera outbreak but is covering it up: 

Ideally, I'd like to cite a source that states that it's theoretically impossible to have a sideways vagina, or that there's no basis in fact to the claim that Asians have sideways vaginas, but maybe biologists think it a claim not worth the effort of debunking. 

The Red Cross has stated that these areas are not women-only, that anyone can use them. From CNN: Red Cross sets up 'women's safety area' in Berlin for NYE : 

(Note: I'm asking about the death penalty. Whether organs get harvested is not at the core of the question.) Also repeated on Wikipedia (citation is apparently to this page, which doesn't mention the death penalty), and in an opinion piece Happy birthday, spam! Do you mind if we donâ€™t celebrate? in The Spectator. 

Picture scraper @Globe_Pics, which has 520,000 followers, tweeted the following (currently 205 retweets, and 135 favorites): 

Does nuclear radiation make heart attacks more likely in and of itself? That is, not caused by the stress associated with a nuclear incident, or because of actions done to avoid radiation, such as not exercising outdoors. 

I recently came across a journal entry, written in December 2012, about racial violence in Australia. The entry mentioned an incident against a woman targeted for singing in French. I assume this refers to an alleged incident against Fanny Desaintjores involving racist abuse and attempted violence: I realised he wasn't kidding ... I stopped laughing. The entry also mentioned an alleged spate of racial violence against Koreans. The entry didn't have any links, but I assume Aussies accused of 'racist violence' in Korean press is the kind of thing the blogger was referring to. But the entry also mentioned an alleged spate of violence against Indians a couple of years ago. I assume the author is referring to this. The author mentioned that the Australian government denied that the violence was racially motivated, but she didn't believe the government. I thought the idea of a spate of racially motivated violence against Indians was debunked. I heard that most of the high profile assault cases that made international headlines turned out to either be violence done by Indians against other Indians, or some Indians trying to commit insurance fraud via arson, and injuring themselves and trying to attribute the arson to racially motivated violence. I've also heard Indian students were highly represented in being victims of robberies, but that they involved Indian students merely because they were working in late night shifts (due to their studies), and therefore more vulnerable to robbery, and that race didn't play a role in the robberies. In Australia, during the late 2000s, and the early 2010s, was there a major spate of violence, committed by people who were not of Indian or related nationality, where the victims were Indian? If so, was the victims' ethnicity or nationality a factor? 

(perhaps truck attacks aren't regarded as "everyday crimes"?) and this tweet (221 RTs, 138 likes) in December 2016. Are Swedish police banned from giving information such ethnicity, nationality, skin colour and height for suspects of at least some categories of crimes? 

In The Guardian's article Cotton production linked to images of the dried up Aral Sea basin, it's claimed that organic cotton uses less water than conventional cotton. 

Did he advocate for concentration camps, in the meaning that is usually interpreted in modern times? That is, death camps like the ones set up by Nazi Germany for many racial and other groups, as opposed to internment camps such as those used for the internment of Japanese, German and Italian ethnicity people in the United States. 

The article In John They Trust, by the Smithsonian confirms that such cargo cults exist. Imitation of western societies: 

Amongst the Daasanach, is nudity not unusual, and are high temperatures the main cause of people being naked? 

The BBC article has no mention of nudity being the result of high temperatures. While browsing the topic, it seemed like women who wore a skirt didn't necessarily wear a top. This may well be the case for the woman photographed, and may be the reason the photo is a headshot. I'd be surprised to see toplessness being interpreted as nudity, however. For an example of women wearing a skirt but not a top, from Getty images: (warning: photo of topless women) Topless dassanech tribe woman, Omo valley, Omorate, Ethiopia
