There is a version of mirror symmetry, called "local mirror symmetry", for certain non-compact Calabi-Yaus, for example the total space of the canonical bundle of P^2 (exercise: show this is CY). The mirror (or rather one possible mirror) of this non-compact Calabi-Yau is an affine elliptic curve in (C^*)^2. I don't think that there is as yet a version of mirror symmetry for more general non-compact CYs, though I don't know too much about this story. In all of the papers that I've looked at on this stuff at least, the only non-compact CYs that have been considered in mirror symmetry so far are total spaces of vector bundles over compact (probably Fano) things. I guess we should probably get some sort of "Hodge diamond symmetry" in local mirror symmetry, but the story becomes more complicated. One immediate thing to notice is that, at least in the example I've given, the dimensions of the manifolds aren't the same! So things will have to be modified. The Hodge diamond symmetry in mirror symmetry for compact Calabi-Yaus should really be thought of as coming from a correspondence between certain deformations of a Calabi-Yau and certain deformations of its mirror. In the non-compact case, the deformations that we should consider will be somewhat different from the deformations that we should consider in the compact case. A somewhat recent point of view, due to Kontsevich, is that this correspondence between deformations can be gotten from homological mirror symmetry. In homological mirror symmetry for compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, we consider a derived category of coherent sheaves on one side and a Fukaya category on the other side. Then we should have an equivalence of categories, plus an equivalence of a certain structure on their Hochschild cohomologies -- in particular their Hochschild cohomologies should be equivalent at least as vector spaces. These Hochschild cohomologies should be thought as the appropriate deformation spaces (or maybe rather the tangent spaces to the appropriate deformation spaces?), and an appropriate identification of the Hochschild cohomologies (plus the extra structure that I mentioned) should give in particular the Hodge diamond symmetry. There should also be homological mirror symmetry for non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, but we must define the analogues of derived category and Fukaya category in this situation appropriately. Then there should be an analogous story on the Hochschild cohomologies of the categories, and an appropriate analogue of the Hodge diamond symmetry. See the paper "Hodge theoretic aspects of mirror symmetry" by Katzarkov-Kontsevich-Pantev for more details. 

First you should know what a "derived scheme" (or "spectral scheme") is. Roughly, this is the same as an ordinary scheme, except instead of locally being the Spec of an ordinary commutative ring, it's locally the Spec of an E-infinity ring spectrum, or just E-infinity ring for short. An E-infinity ring is not the same as a ring spectrum; a ring spectrum is something that is "a ring up to homotopy", and an E-infinity ring is something that is "a ring up to coherent homotopy". As a topological space, Spec of an E-infinity ring A is defined to be the Spec of pi0(A), which is an ordinary commutative ring. The difference is that the sheaf of functions is no longer a sheaf of rings but a sheaf of E-infinity rings. This sheaf of E-infinity rings is (analogously to the structure sheaf for ordinary affine schemes) defined by Uf -> A[f-1], where Uf is a distinguished open subset, and the localization A[f-1] is now taken in the category (or rather infinity-category) of E-infinity rings (see section 2.2 of Lurie's survey for a characterization of this localization). There is a natural functor from derived schemes to ordinary schemes. It is (X, OX) -> (X, pi0(OX)), where pi0(OX) denotes the sheafification of the presheaf U -> pi0(OX(U)). Then Definition 4.1 of Lurie's survey article defines an elliptic curve over an E-infinity ring A: it is a commutative A-group E -> Spec A such that (E, pi0(OE)) -> Spec pi0(A) is an ordinary elliptic curve over pi0(A). I think one of the punchlines is that there is a derived Deligne-Mumford moduli stack of oriented derived elliptic curves, which becomes the ordinary Deligne-Mumford moduli stack of ordinary elliptic curves after hitting it with pi0. Taking global sections on this derived moduli stack is more or less tmf. I don't have a good short explanation of what an orientation is, but it's in the beginning of section 3 of the survey. Unfortunately I think a lot of the details of this stuff are still not available. (I think it is supposed to be in "DAG VII: Spectral Schemes"; there may be some hints and related material in "DAG V: Structured Spaces".) 

Here is a problem that requires nontrivial integration techniques, because the closed form answer is a sum of an algebraic and trigonometric function. If you have ever pulled down blinds by the edge, the parallel slats slant down and make an envelope for a certain curve. In the limit of infinitely dense slats, what is this curve? In case you can't picture this, the curve is defined by the condition that the length of the tangent line from the curve to the y-axis is constant. This is one of the few cases where a reasonably general integral comes out naturally. As for the IVT/MVT, they are not particularly profound. It is in my opinion better to prove things by bisection (which easily proves both, gives intuitive proofs for all their consequences, and essentially is sequential compactness). Bisection was used in 19th century texts, but fell out of favor when the completeness of the reals became standardly axiomatized as the least upper bound principle. 

To me, the only "unintuitive" applications of uncountable choice is when it turns up in physics. The only case I know where this happens is in the maximal-extension theorem of Choquet-Bruhat (QM does not use uncountable choice). This uses local extension properties of solutions to General Relativity to prove, using Zorn's lemma, that there exists a maximal extension. The use of axiom of choice is, I think, essential. I couldn't see how to sidestep it when I read the paper a long time ago (somebody please correct me if I am wrong). What is the axiom of choice doing in physics? I believe that it is entirely due to the issue of double-sided maximally extended black holes. A maximal extension of General Relativity can contain "wormhole" like solutions (for example, a charged black holes with two patches connected by an interior region), and there can be countably many such bridges in any asymptotically flat patch. But each of these branches can connect you to another different asymptotically flat region, which might have its own countably infinite collection of bridges to other flat regions. The resulting spacetime is like a tree with countably many branches at each node, where each node represents an asymptotically flat spacetime, and each edge is a double-sided maximally extended black hole bridging the two nodes. Such a tree can have infinite depth, and you must extend the solution to the whole tree. It seems intuitive that to patch the solutions together you need to extend the local solutions over continuum many nodes, and since GR is hyperbolic, you will get to make some arbitrary choices at each extension step. The dependence on choice then simply shows how unreasonable the maximally extended model of General Relativity is for physics. 

So ... what is the Fourier transform? What does it do? Why is it useful (both in math and in engineering, physics, etc)? (Answers at any level of sophistication are welcome.) 

What is the current status of these conjectures? Are there any cases where any of this is known to be true, or known to be false? Costello's paper states "I really don't know of much evidence" --- perhaps our state of knowledge is better by now? 

Here is my rough understanding. In a TCFT we have chains on moduli spaces $\widetilde{M}$ of Riemann surfaces with parameterized boundary acting (in the sense of operads, PROPs, whatever) on a chain complex $V$. The action should be compatible with the various gluing maps.* (For simplicity, let's just deal with closed TCFTs, and not open or open-closed TCFTs.) I think that to extend to DM space means something like the following: First, we would like to have an action of moduli spaces $M$ of Riemann surfaces with unparameterized boundary -- which is the same up to homotopy as moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces with marked points and no boundary** -- which is compatible with the action of $\widetilde{M}$. Compatible here means, I think, compatible with the map $\widetilde{M} \to M$ which forgets the parameterization. Moreover we want the action of chains on $M$ to be compatible with the various gluing maps, which are well-defined up to homotopy.*** Finally, we would like to extend this action from chains on $M$ to chains on $\overline{M}$, the Deligne-Mumford spaces of stable Riemann surfaces with marked points and no boundary. The actions should be compatible with $M \hookrightarrow \overline{M}$. Moreover the action of $\overline{M}$ should be compatible with the various gluing maps.**** See pages 62 and 63 of Kontsevich-Soibelman for some details. The statement is that, if the Calabi-Yau category corresponding to your (open) TCFT satisfies the "degeneration conjecture" (an analogue of Hodge-de Rham degeneration), then there exists an extension to DM space. Recall that Costello proved that TCFTs correspond to Calabi-Yau categories. Also take a look at the first two sections of this paper of Teleman. For an alternative approach to these sorts of questions, see this paper of Costello. 

I am wondering: Are there any general theorems or principles relating the theory of Z-graded dg objects and the theory of Z/2Z-graded dg objects? I am mainly interested in dg algebras, dg Lie algebras, and dg categories over fields of characteristic zero. 

I don't know very much about this stuff, so I'm a bit afraid that I'm being naive or stupid, and I apologize if I am --- but it seems to me that Weil cohomology theories, or at least the standard examples thereof, are essentially, or are supposed to be, generalizations or algebraic versions of singular cohomology. If I am incorrect in this assessment, please do correct me. Meanwhile, we have other interesting cohomology theories in topology: for example (topological) K-theory, elliptic cohomology, complex cobordism, .... Correspondingly, then, are there notions of "K-Weil cohomology theory" or "elliptic Weil cohomology theory", etc.? Is it possible?
