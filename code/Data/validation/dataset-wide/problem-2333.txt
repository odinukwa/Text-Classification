The examples on the site only show inshore sports sailing with a hydrofoil. This does look like fun, and downwind performance can be exceptional. Though I doubt that inshore fleet racing would be possible as the kites would surely get tangled. As for bluewater sailing, it seems that no-one is arguing that it is practical with current technology. Masts hold sails up in light air, but a kite is going to fall at times. Even with adequate wind speed they need careful nursing to prevent stalling. Fallen rigs are hard to handle and relaunch can be impossible in difficult conditions. Do you fancy having the kite and rigging under your hull in the Southern Ocean? Or tangled under another boat in congested waters? With current designs the minimum practical wind-speed is around 10k per hour. At present lighter-than-air kites that would stay aloft in light winds (using helium, for example) aren't seen as workable. In tight situations such as busy ports or estuaries the kite would also be impractical and probably dangerous. In the demo films they are sometimes flying over other people's masts which seems pretty questionable. And they only just made it under the Golden Gate, so most bridges would be too low. Another major issue is upwind performance. Current kite designs have a lift-to-drag ratio of around half that of a conventional rig, meaning that they can make less than half the speed upwind. Tacking is tricky, so you are generally restricted to gybing. You are also restricted to sailing light hulls, as the largest workable kites are still quite small. Finally, there's the question of handling gusts and squalls. With current kite designs control is cumbersome and there is a real possibility of structural failure, or of the hull being lifted out of the water with catastrophic results. While there are potential technical solutions to these issues it seems that they are still some way off. So at first sight this looks like a cool idea with a somewhat limited range of application - at least for the time being. 

There are 297 species using the flyway and tens of thousands of individuals per year. They are mainly waterfowl and waders, but an interesting exception is the recently discovered route of a population of Northern Wheatears in Eastern Canada - a small songbird that migrates through Europe to winter in North Africa. There's been a lot of interest in this flyway recently as it provides a vector for Avian Flu to move between European and American populations, with many migration routes overlapping in Iceland, Greenland and Eastern Canada. I'm not aware of any bird from south of Arctic Canada that makes it over to Europe, apart from the occasional exotic blown over by storms. Most migrations are on a north-south axis, as populations follow food sources across the seasons. There would be little advantage for a bird from lower latitudes in the Americas to make a strenuous migration to a similar latitude and season in Europe. 

I have a bee in my bonnet about this one. Conventional trekking poles evolved out of ski-poles, but they have a different function and simply don't work very well for walking. The warning sign is that you need to resort to the artificial expedient of straps to actually hold on to the things. This can be inconvenient, uncomfortable and puts unnatural pressure on the joints. 

Down is a natural product, so fill quality, odour and durability can vary quite markedly within a species depending on the breed, age and condition of the bird. Practical performance is also strongly dependent on the skill of the processor and the quality of any proofing applied. These sources of variation are greater than any variation between duck and goose down, so in practical terms duck and goose down of equivalent fill-power should perform similarly, provided they both come from a reputable supplier. Philip Werner at SectionHiker.com reviews a lot of gear. Here's his take: 

There is a clear answer here: just don't do it! Glacier rescue is challenging - you need to know the techniques and practice them seriously. And I can tell you from experience that a glacier rescue is scary, stressful and exhausting, and that was with a party of 4 fit and experienced adults. If you have to ask the question, you simply don't have the skills to execute safely. Two highly skilled adults on a glacier with hidden crevasses is very sketchy: it can be difficult to hold a fall and even more difficult to extract - often impossible if the faller is injured. There is no way the kid could hold the adult, never mind rescue them from the crevasse. It would be grossly irresponsible to venture onto a dangerous glacier with just an adult and child on the rope. With two skilled adults and a kid you are effectively in the same marginal situation as two adults on their own, but with additional risks and responsibilities. The kid won't have the weight, skill or temperament to be anything other than a hindrance if anything goes wrong. And if it's the kid who falls in, it might be a traumatic experience for them even if they don't get injured. The OP has clarified that this is a recreational trip and that their aim is to climb a particular peak with their daughter. There is no way that a glacier of this kind can be made safe for a child in a small party. Please be responsible and find a safer route for your outing. 

Sometimes the old ways are the best ways. No approach will be ideal in every situation, but if you standardise on a single, flexible approach it will be good enough for most of what you do, and you will get to know its pros and cons so you develop habits that work. This will be safer in the long run. Finding something that works for your back issues The only reason that a bandolier might not work for you would be your back issues. In contrast to what you posted, it seems logical that the most back-friendly position for your gear would be your harness - this puts all the weight on your hips. Your proposed solution seems to put all the weight on your back and shoulders. The bandolier does put the weight on your shoulder, but it moves as you climb which would vary the direction of pressure, and you could alternate shoulders from pitch to pitch. So it might be less uncomfortable than you would imagine. You'll just have to experiment. But to me, the pack-based solution is too specialised - I think you'd be better taking a longer view and developing an approach that will adapt to a wider range of trad situations as your skills and ambitions develop. 

For expedition work in countries where fuel might be dirty or hard to find you'd be better with a stove like the MSR XGK EX Multi-Fuel. It's heavier and more expensive, but much more adaptable. In a country like Nepal where fuel is notoriously dirty, you would want to take spare fuel filters. 

What is dead reckoning? Dead reckoning is the skill of moving along a specific bearing for a specific distance - eg, to walk 350 meters on a 25 degree bearing - without reference to any major feature in the landscape. When is dead reckoning required? The foundation of land navigation is the attack point, a term borrowed from orienteering. Basically, this is a feature you aim for that you are confident you will recognise when you reach it and which moves you towards your eventual target for the day. Typical examples would be a peak, a pass, a trail junction or a hut. By moving from attack point to attack point you get regular checks that you are on course. Many navigation techniques such as handrails and gathering features are aimed at helping you find your attack point. Other techniques such as pacing and timing are designed to alert you that you have missed your attack point. And another group of techniques is designed to help you get back on route once you realise that you have gone astray. Dead reckoning is needed when your next attack point is not visible, and there is no reliable trail to follow. So you have to navigate on a bearing until the attack point becomes visible. This can be because the land is rough or overgrown, or because of fog or whiteout. How do you navigate on a bearing? With a base-plate compass you sight down the direction of travel line and pick out a minor feature such as a tree or a rock, and walk to it. Repeat till your attack point comes into view. In very difficult country such as a featureless desert or ice-field there may be nothing to aim at. In this case you can send a member of your party ahead an agreed number of paces and use a system of signals to move them left or right till they are in line with the direction of travel. Then you walk up to them and repeat. If you are solo, you can throw stones or snowballs along the line of travel. This is a slow and tedious process, but is sometimes life-saving. How do you estimate distance? In many cases you will have to measure how far you have walked along the bearing to avoid over-shooting your attack point. You measure the distance on the map with the correct scale on your compass base-plate. It's important that you know how many paces you need to cover that distance in various conditions, or alternatively, how much time it should take. In critical situations you might want to use both methods. What are the limitations of dead reckoning? Dead reckoning is not an accurate technique, as mistakes cumulate and it is not self-correcting. So experienced navigators do everything they can to minimise the length of dead reckoning legs (anything over 300-400 meters is pretty error-prone), or use handrails and gathering features to minimise the need for accuracy. In safety-critical situations they would often prefer to walk farther on a route that is easier to navigate rather than risk a long dead-reckoning leg. Practice makes perfect Dead reckoning in challenging conditions is a skill you need to develop consciously. When you find yourself in a blinding fog or blizzard, you want to be confident in your technique. The key skills include: 

There's a lot of skill to taping effectively - there's a substantial chapter in the book and the devil's in the detail. As well as using the right brand for the application, you also have to prepare the skin correctly, use the correct amount of stretch and apply far enough in advance for the adhesive to set. And taping to protect an existing blister requires additional techniques. You can also apply tapes to the shoe or the socks to counter specific issues such as a rough seam. Of course taping is just part of the picture. You also have to consider: conditioning; shoe and sock selection; insoles; lacing techniques; powders, lubricants antiperspirants and skin-toughening agents, If you stress your feet with ultra events, thru-hikes and the like, finding the right combination of solutions will likely take a lot of experimentation. You can short-cut the whole process by building on the experience of others, and the book is an eye-opener - highly recommended. 

The one disadvantage is that PLBs don't offer messaging so you can't inform the rescue services of your specific situation. So they should only be activated in genuinely life-threatening emergencies when all other options have been exhausted, as a call will trigger a full-scale rescue response. You register your PLB with the designated authority in your country so rescuers will know about you, your normal activities, and any health issues. There are no ongoing fees. THE LIMITATIONS OF SATELLITE MESSENGERS By contrast, satellite messengers such as the Spot and the DeLorme are essentially tracking and texting devices with rescue added as an afterthought. They hook into the commercial satellite networks Iridium or Globalstar, and use a commercial rescue response centre. These satellite networks are far less robust - just read reviews for satellite phones to understand the issues. And transmission power is around one tenth that of a dedicated PLB so they generally won't work unless you have an unrestricted view of the sky. Because these devices have other draws on the battery such as GPS and messaging their power supply will be much less reliable. And if you do reach a satellite, response may be markedly slower. Satellite messengers require ongoing contracts which can be expensive and complex to administer. If your account is out of order when you get into trouble you may not be able to use your device. Over their lifetime, they will work out much more costly than a PLB. These multi-purpose messengers are more suited to casual use and were never meant to be a replacement for a dedicated PLB. THE LIMITATIONS OF CONVENTIONAL SIGNALLING METHODS Traditional solutions such as whistles, lights, mirrors or flares offer none of the advantages of either of the satellite-based options. They don't work in storm conditions or if you are remote from other parties, and they offer little help to search and rescue until they are very close to your location. Personally I always carry a whistle, mirror and strobe, and would use them in frequented areas where there was a good chance of a response before I would resort to triggering the PLB. But they are a very inferior option when things get really nasty. SEARCH AND RESCUE WILL THANK YOU FOR CARRYING A PLB As you can imagine, PLBs are very popular with rescuers, who are guided straight to the casualty. Contrast this with resource intensive and often dangerous searches should a rescue be triggered when you fail to reach your destination and your location is unknown. With a PLB, rescue will reach you hours or even days more quickly. Searching large areas for a casualty is a massive exercise, and some people are never found at all... Do please think of these selfless rescuers (very often volunteers) and make their lives easier by carrying a PLB. In some jurisdictions a PLB may also save you a fortune in rescue charges as there will be no need for extensive search. IN WILDERNESS COUNTRY, A PLB IS THE WAY TO GO As someone who does a lot of solo walking in remote locations, a PLB offers considerable peace of mind. My finances are tight, but I regard it as a very worthwhile investment and so does my family. Over its lifetime a PLB will only cost you around $40 a year. If you go into wilderness country, you owe it to yourself, to your loved ones and to the rescue services to carry one.
