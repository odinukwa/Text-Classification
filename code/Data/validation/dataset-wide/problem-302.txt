No cool down period? Not even one nanosecond? Sounds like there's a lack of understanding of reality here. Life exists on Earth from high in the atmosphere to deep underground. What you want to do apparently (but you're not clear) is irradiate the entire planet so that there's a zero survival rate even for organisms heavily shielded and isolated. And do it with such intensity that the dose is supplied virtually instantly. We don't know how deep underground microbes exist, we've found evidence for them as deep as 12 miles. The most obvious sterilization methods I can think of which could penetrate 12-15 miles of rock would be X-rays but it would leave radioactives behind. I'm not capable of calculating the extent such energy would transmute atoms, but it's fairly trivial to calculate the intensity of a beam of x-rays (of a given frequency (distribution)) which would effectively sterilize through 15 miles of rock. The issues with waste heat might be addressed by cooling the Earth by passing an opaque (or semi-opaque) cloud between the Earth and the Sun. So, I'd say runaway greenhouse effect is a red-herring. What the surface would be like after such an attack, I've no idea. Perhaps someone else can calculate the effects of an extreme x-ray burst, if you ask that specific question. (heat and radioactivity are the most important effects, there may be secondary effects (such as loss of atmosphere)) 

Your "a priori"s are ... dubious. For the no nuclear bombs, I guess you'd need to require that they know more about the effects of radiation and fall-out, and are morally opposed to using them - even though it will cost their own son's lives. Yeah, better we send our sons to die, than risk one of those pesky enemy lives! If they have some "underwater weapons" that prevent ships from getting close, then you have to explain how the supership is going to get close - it would be an even bigger and easier target. You didn't mention air power, but clearly, control of the sea depends on whether airplanes or dirigibles exist. These "underwater weapons" would need to have their ammunition replenished. If via tunnels, then destroy the tunnels; if via submarines, then destroy the subs (using your own "underwater weapons"). Weight is proportional to volume which is the third power of length. Support for the treads is proportional to the second power of length. Meaning as you increase the size of the ship, the tread area scales at the 3/2 power. (meaning it goes exponential). You seem to be assuming your ship will be perfectly rigid. It won't. How you'd actually support the ship over its treads would be enormously difficult (although you're probably aware of how NASA does a similar thing). I find the idea that you're going to get these treads onto a sufficiently hard surface implausible - they'll get stuck in the muck. (As the shore batteries destroy the ship...). A little physics/mechanics: the hull of a ship supports its weight over a massive surface area, you'd have to support that same weight with arms (pylons?) on top of the tread dollies. This would require the entire redesign of a ship. Basically, it's not a ship, its a building. On wheels (treads) I know of no building which would survive bombardment for more than a couple of minutes. Feel free to investigate the weights of your cannons. It's easy to find it. You also need to explain why you'd need different sizes of guns.(I understand the need for protecting against small boarding parties), but not the 6 sizes you mention. They say defense is easier than offense. That is only true for a point location. When you have to defend an entire coastline (or any other type of border), then the advantage is heavily tilted to the offense, which can pick its point(s) to attack (as well as time). 

Separate future-Brooklyn from now-Brooklyn. If the two Brooklyns are together, and someone asked future-Brooklyn a question, now-Brooklyn would also hear it, and she would subconsciously think of the answer. Since future-Brooklyn is suspected to be telepathic, she would be able to hear the answer in now-Brooklyn's head and say it. So, put now-Brooklyn somewhere else, where she wouldn't even hear it if future-Brooklyn were shouting at the top of her lungs. If it's impossible to physically separate them, give now-Brooklyn a pair of headphones and tell her to watch TV/listen to music while staring at the wall, or just knock her unconscious for a while. Just make sure she has no way of knowing what questions future-Brooklyn is being asked. Have both Amanda and Brian collaborate to ask future-Brooklyn questions that neither of them know the answer to, and those questions have to be factual. Nomatter how far you travel, how old you are, or how many things you've experienced, the answer cannot change, and both Amanda and Brian cannot know the answer. For example: During vacation when you were 10 years old (assuming now-Brooklyn is about 15), what colour was your toothbrush at your hotel? She wouldn't have considered it necessary to share that information with anyone, and the toothbrush will remain the same colour in her memories, nomatter what. Or What was the last thing you said to your mother and/or father when you last saw her/him/them? It would be personal enough that she wouldn't have shared it with anyone, and apart from slight forgetfulness, her feelings, opinions, beliefs and experiences would not have changed the fact. By the way, future-Brooklyn would have to answer the questions truthfully. 20+ questions should be enough. Amanda and Brian, not knowing if the answers are right or wrong, would have to write them all down. But they must not let now-Brooklyn see the questions or the answers. Let now-Brooklyn back into the picture, with absolutely no idea what questions were asked and what was answered. Amanda and Brian will ask now-Brooklyn the exact same questions, in the exact same order, etc. And still do not let her see future-Brooklyn's answers: you do not want her to be influenced by what she sees written down. Now-Brooklyn also has to answer truthfully, and Amanda and Brian can check her answers with future-Brooklyn's answers. Cross-reference the answers. If both Brookylns gave the same answers to most (well, actually, should be all) of the questions, then you know that future-Brooklyn is legitimate. If there is a large discrepancy, or if it looks like future-Brooklyn was guessing, you know she's a phony. 

Having trouble understanding your question. Define "intelligent life". Since the experts can't define what intelligence is, I'm doubting you'll have any greater success. (And I'm avoiding altogether the definition of "life"...) Intelligence isn't a "yes/no" property. Tool use dates back (in our genetic lineage) to somewhere between 2½ and 4 million years. So, sure, little green men could have come down and tinkered with our genes. Probably could still be doing it, although the vector(s) they'd be using would have to be more sophisticated. I don't understand why you think such interference/modification would necessarily leave traces? It wouldn't have to. 

Is it possible? Well, I wrote "no" but in defending that position, I thought of a possible scenario where it was. First, how do you illuminate a sphere uniformly? Well, I can't think of any way even with 3 sources (stars). So, could you spin it fast enough so that the entire surface was over a local 'day' exposed to the same heating? Maybe, but I can't wrap my mind around that. I'm guessing you can't. My original model is the primary sun always over the equator, and two fainter suns directly above the N and S rotational axes. The amount of illumination averages to nearly the same, and with winds the weather is the same (why constant illumination (at the poles) would result in the same biome as a (fast?) day-night cycle is a different problem). So, maybe you can do something with that. A couple of easy calculations would determine the amount of insolation per day per square meter at the poles, equator, and at 45°. They'd need to be close. OK, that was a digression. If you had clouds, you could modify the insolation, but I don't think that works. Water clouds = rain, and its a dry world, sand clouds = contribution to different weather/climate. The thicker the atmosphere, the more the illumination can be averaged. So, here's my idea: why not a very thick atmosphere around a planet which is far from any star which relies on its internal heat - the star contributing virtually none of its energy. These type planets are theorized to exist, and aren't necessarily attached to a star. (wandering planet). 

The main reason I can think of is that the aliens realise that they have certain drawbacks that prevent them from accomplishing their purpose/mission on Earth. With selective genetics, they could create an alien-human hybrid that possesses the strengths of the alien and also of the human. That way, if they want to colonize/take over the world, they have the perfect species to do so: a hybrid that maybe looks and behaves like a human and can survive in Earth's atmosphere, and yet is subject to the group mindset and follows the bidding of the pure aliens. The above scenario could be if aliens are new to the world and thus have (perhaps) sinister motives. Alternatively, in a Star Wars environment, where aliens are already an accepted part of life, such a hybrid could solve the problem of boundaries and citizenship. For example, in current climes, if a German father married an Asian mother, their children could possibly be citizens of either country. Thus, the same concept could be applied with respect to aliens, where the aliens would then strengthen their footing on Earth. 

I personally prefer having they in front of me, physically. So I'd recommend writing/typing out brief explanations of your concepts. Just a few lines each, that can fit on a piece of card/paper maybe the size of your hand. One concept per card. Print them out and arrange them in front of you (maybe 10 cards per row, work your way from left to right, and downwards), then when you're happy with the arrangement, number them in pencil. Maybe best to worst, or in chronological order, etc. So it's easier if you need to move things around in future, then you can just change the numbers. This way, after you're done arranging and numbering, you can just sweep them up and keep them in a stack, without worrying about forgetting the order. As you formulate your ideas, go through the concepts one by one. 

You mention magic in your post. Sorry, magic and logic are incompatible. In a world with magic, nothing need be logical. In a logical world, nothing can be magical. Tell me, if you expected to live 900 years, would you engineer your kids to live 80 on the off chance that one of them will be a scientist? Hint: divide both numbers by 10, and ask again. I'd suggest an alternative: one theory as to why young scientists (there is an enormous difference between a scientist, a technologist, and an innovator!!) are more fruitful than older ones, is that their neural connections are being formed at a much higher rate (between 15-25). Death isn't relevant. Why not just program techno-elves to periodically gain-lose-re-form their minds/memories? 

Define "conquer". This question is like one asking how long a date should last, or how long a book should be. It is obvious that you will need to: 1. Have sufficient troops to defeat any military opposition and 2. Have sufficient troops to occupy/police/administer the land you have won. If you assume your 'reign' will be just as popular as the old one was, then your military/police support will need to be identical. That is a huge number of men/people - but it clearly depends on the pre-existing governmental structure. Generally, there will always be local people willing to support you, but you'll still need to train/indoctrinate them, as well as supervise them (i.e. your new government). You apparently envision a single army - and that's ridiculous. You're not going to conquer a continent going town to town with a single army. OTOH, if the continent is ruled by a single king/queen/emperor then all you need is to take over his/her position and surround yourself with enough supporters to overcome any opposition. 10 people might do it, 10 million might not be enough. Anything else you need to know? Sure is. Lots. Trump "conquered" North America in about ~18 months. It took Europeans ~300 years to conquer N.A. from the "natives". So, somewhere in between is reasonable, Africa is 23% bigger than N.A. 

The good thing about it is that it makes all future-Brooklyn's powers completely redundant. Speed and power mimicking would not help her here. And, if she really were a telepath, there would be nothing useful to pick up in other people's minds, because neither of them would be thinking of the answers. Amanda and Brian would not know the answers, and now-Brooklyn would not even hear the questions, until after future-Brooklyn has already given all her answers. By then, it's too late to change her answers if she realises it was wrong. Also, by asking factual questions, it would not matter how old either of them were or what happened to future-Brooklyn in those 5 years. For example, if you were to ask a opinion question, like If you were to see your first, most beloved pet, Jack the dog, would you be happy or sad?, now-Brooklyn might say she would be happy, because she loved that dog. But future-Brooklyn may have let's say watched her friend get viciously attacked and eaten by a dog during those 5 years. Though the memory would have been suppressed, subconsciously, she would have developed a phobia of dogs, without knowing why right now. So she might say, she'd be frightened, cos she's scared of dogs. And this would cause errors in the cross-referencing of answers, unlike the factual questions above. Nomatter what happened to you, if your toothbrush was blue, you will always remember it to be blue. 

Assuming, as mentioned in the question, that the user is protected from the effects of the sword, heat would not be an issue. As long as the user is holding the sword, he is protected from its heat. However, there are other issues. Time and Convenience If the sword heats up for only 1 minute, after 15 mins of recharging, then that's hardly efficient. That's a 15:1 ratio. Thus, seeing as a battle could last for several hours, the sword would then need at least a couple of days prior to the battle to charge. This would, of course, be an issue and a nuisance, because you may never know when the sword and its intense heat function may be needed, or for how long. With such an inefficient power output ratio, it may well be that the sword's intense heat function might rarely be used, if ever, simply because it just takes way too long to charge. Reliability How would the user know how much power is left in the sword, before it needs to be re-charged? It is possible that the user may come across a situation where the intense heat function is desperately needed, but activates it, only to find that there isn't enough power to heat the sword up for longer than a second. Some sort of timer should be incorporated into the sword to inform the user how much longer the sword can produce such heat. Safe-keeping The user may be protected from the heating effects of the sword, but not everything around him or it. The obvious housing for such a sword would be a scabbard, but then the scabbard would also have to be protected from the heat. This is so that the scabbard does not instantly explode in a cloud of ash if the sword is accidentally activated inside the scabbard. Especially because scabbards are usually made of wood, or leather. The scabbard could be made of the same material as the sword, of course, since the sword is not damaged by the heat, but that would make the scabbard very heavy. If, on the other hand, the material used to make the sword is light enough that the scabbard would not be a hindrance, then the sword itself would not have enough force when used, because it is too light. 

I don't believe for a moment that the principles behind any process have to be understood. Did an understanding of photosynthesis precede growing crops? I've no doubt that to advance/improve the state of the art, understanding helps enormously, but even then it's not required (see $URL$ We need to be careful here. The first TV was displayed in 1907 (static images) and was fully feasible by 1925 and in the next 10 years, the technology grew exponentially. Why? Well, that's a subject for historians, but "critical mass" is part of it. It's not enough that a technology is known to be possible, nor even has been built, what is required is that there is a need for it AND that the benefits out weigh the costs. For the TV, it was the increasing availability of electronic vacuum tubes. In the case of a bronze age steam engine, the costs of a "one off" would be enormous. And if the technology was changed so that, say bronze machines were ubiquitous, then it wouldn't be Ancient Greece anymore. Anyway, to answer your question: Yes, given sufficient money (or power), someone who knew how could have had one built. You might be able to say the same thing about a TV. I'd guess with nearly unlimited resources, you could have the many needed technological advances achieved in 50 years or so. But this is a chicken and egg problem. If someone knew enough, then there would have been more advanced technologies: knowledge doesn't happen in a vacuum. I doubt if today, one person exists who would be able to construct a TV using artisans with only bronze age technical understanding. A steam engine would, I think, be easier; requiring only mechanical engineering, industrial engineering and metallurgical (and chemical) knowledge.
