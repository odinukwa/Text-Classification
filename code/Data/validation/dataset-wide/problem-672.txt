You're probably thinking of Rideable - Cycling Visualisations. They have videos showing commutes in Sydney, London and Bristol. There are other projects such as the London Cycling Census. That compares different vehicle types (bicycles, cars, buses, lorries, etc). More generally, The Guardian Datablog is a good source for this sort of information. 

Source - Metabolic Factors Limiting Performance in Marathon Runners (While the above paper is aimed at marathon runners, I'm not aware of any reason it can't be applied to other endurance sports such as long-distance cycling.) Exercise is fuelled by a combination of fat (plasma free fatty acids plus muscle triglycerides) and carbohydrate (plasma glucose plus muscle glycogen). The proportions used vary depending on the intensity of the exercise. 

Exercise at a particular intensity can be maintained until you run out of carbohydrate - "hitting the wall" or "bonking". Intensity is expressed as a % of VO2max, which can be estimated from heart rate. In order to work out how much carbohydrate you have available, you need to estimate how much glycogen you can store in your leg muscles, how much glycogen you can store in your liver and how much carbohydrate you can take on as food (gels, sports drinks, etc) during exercise. The methods section of the paper goes into this in detail. In order to apply this practically to cycling you should take measurements of the power you can produce at various intensities (heart rates). If you don't have the equipment to measure power, then measure speed on a flat course and estimate the power from that. Having done all that you should be able to calculate the total energy required for a particular distance at a particular speed and what proportion of that energy will come from carbohydrate. You also have an estimate of how much carbohydrate you have available and that will tell you if you're likely to hit the wall / bonk. 

Ask the boss/janitor if there is some storage space available. Maybe there's a storage closet, the bottom of a stairwell, unused rooms in the basement or some such. In my current job, we have a corner in storage where old equipment is stored until there is enough to scrap, and I was always allowed to put my bike there. If you get your space, think about putting a tarp on the floor to keep it clean if your bike is wet or you hang your gaiters on the bike to dry. Maybe you can even get your bosses to put in a bike rack in a spare room/garage and promote cycling to work to keep people fit. 

Even if the glass doesn't work through the puncture proof layer (which it will, eventually), it's still a good idea to check once in a while for cuts etc, especially in the side walls, which almost never have a puncture proof layer. It's a "better safe than sorry" approach, but it takes all of five minutes to check both tires, so in my opinion that's time well spent if you know what happens when the tires blow out on a descent or, in your case, running a green light very late. 

If you ever consider having a more than two-wheeled bicycle, e.g. a recumbent trike, you can no longer use one-wheeled, a.k.a. inline trailers because they will add a lot of lateral torque while cornering, making the whole train fall over to the outside of the corner far easier. 

In Germany, there's the "Zweiradmechaniker", which is taught like any other craft, i.e. you learn it from an existing mechanic. You don't need to have this education to open a bike store though. 

Legal issues aside, cycling along a tramway can be dangerous. This blog entry describes the problem: 

Personally, I wouldn't do it. It's a lot of pain for what is probably a very small gain. If you're looking to wring every last bit of performance out of your body it's worth trying though. 

Short answer - there's no widely recognized hand gesture for I'm sorry. You could try the American Sign Language for sorry: 

The Highway Code (Rule 180) states that when turning right "Do not cut the corner", so it seems quite likely that doing so and nearly hitting someone would constitute careless driving. The driver could be given a fixed penalty (probably 3 points), or made to go on a driving course, or taken to court, or let off with a warning. If the driver came up with a different version of events to yours then a video recording or a reliable and credible witness would be useful. There might be other evidence, e.g. skid marks on the road. 

Lance Armstrong has announced that he will no longer fight charges brought against him by the US anti-doping agency. The USADA says it will ban him for life and strip him of his 7 Tour de France titles. Armstrong says that the USADA does not have the authority to do that. My understanding is that the International Cycling Union (UCI) is in charge of professional cycling events, including the Tour de France. So what is the relationship between the UCI and the USADA (and other anti-doping agencies)? Who has the final say over banning and disqualifying cyclists? 

If it's just a very short "zing" once every revolution, there's nothing to worry about -- it's pretty normal at least for downhill-oriented bikes to have their discs slightly out of true and bending them back will probably do more damage than good. Otherwise, you should either take the bike to your LBS to get the disc trued or get a truing tool and do it yourself. 

I believe one reason is more "stiffness" in the cable. Cable housing typically contracts when the cable is contracted. That's why Nokon also builds bicycle cable housing now. With The frame attachments, you get almost half a meter less housing that may contract. This could lead to crisper shift and brake feel. 

It depends. On a road bike you'll want them fairly tight to be able to ride on the hoods without the brake levers turning away or moving downward on the bar. On a mountain bike, at least the brake levers should be able to rotate away in case of a crash. But they still should be relatively tight such that they don't turn away while braking or because of bumps. Depending on where you ride, I'd rather have them a little too tight than lose the ability to brake because the levers are somewhere they're not supposed to be. As a rule of thumb, you shouldn't be able to rotate them without applying some force, similar to opening a pickle jar. 

The HP Velotechnik Scorpion is available with three front chain rings, three-gear internal hub, 8-speed rear derailleur setup. This has the additional advantage that you can shift while stopped, e.g. after emergency stops or similar. I found it rather tedious to keep the overview over which gear I'm currently in. My Velomobiel Quest has triple front, 9-speed rear derailleur and that covers enough ground for me. Walking pace is not a problem and I spin out at about 70km/h, which is already pretty hard to keep up, even with race fairing. Depending on where you live, riding 70km/h is already pretty dangerous taking into account that trikes cannot brake too well because the rear wheel will lift off pretty quickly. 

I think a more practical solution to your problem of forgetting to lock your bike would be a device (or method) to remind you to lock it. You could try a bluetooth proximity alarm tag. You pair the tag with your phone, then attach the tag to your bike. When the phone gets out of range of the tag an alarm goes off on the phone (range is typically around 10 feet). So when you park your bike and walk off, your phone will sound an alarm. This will remind you to go back to the bike and lock it. 

The "early start" allows cyclists to clear the junction ahead of motorists, this is useful for cyclists making off-side turns (right in the UK, left in the US). It also helps cyclists going straight on avoid conflict with motorists making near-side turns (left in the UK, right in the US). The UK and many places in Europe have Advanced Stop Lines (Highway Code rule 178) at traffic lights: 

You should refer to the manual for the helmet for cleaning instructions. Usually it will say to use mild soap and water. A helmet will not be damaged by water, but don't use heat to dry it afterwards as this can destroy your helmet. Also, if the padding is removable then you might be able to get replacement pads. 

Note that only reported accidents where a police officer attended the scene are included in the statistics. This Wikipedia article has some details of the methodology used to collect the statistics. The complete data set is available here. The data above is taken from the table RAS50005 - Vehicles in reported accidents by contributory factor and vehicle type, Great Britain, 2014. 

I still don't understand why people are so anxious to get the pressure right to the last millibar. It will vary with load, temperature and time anyway, even on a relatively short ride of only a couple of km. As long as it's more or less correct, that's good enough. For road bikes (~8 bar/116 psi typical tire pressure), a 0.2 bar/3 psi difference is absolutely acceptable IMHO. On an MTB, which runs far lower pressures, less is better, but as the tires are far bigger, a pump stroke will also not put that much more pressure on them. In the end, I try to end up within ~3% of the target, which has served me well the last 20 years. So, what @Remy said in his comment is the way to go. Prestas will click open when the pressure in the hose surpasses that in the tube. So don't lean on your pump with full force until that happens and you're good to go. Also, most floor pumps designed for road bikes don't have the volume to make your tires burst with just one stroke. 

The brakes should adjust themselves automatically. Try pumping the lever all the way a couple of times. If that doesn't help, or the contact feels squishy, the brakes probably need bleeding. Either do that yourself or take the bike to your LBS. 

You could try to wheelie the entire descent. This would at least avoid a flip-over, but you will probably lose most of you speed to the rear shock compression when you hit the ditch. 

I have had this problem when running (it's known as jogger's nipple). It's caused by friction when your top rubs against your nipples, moisture from sweat (or rain) tends to make it worse. Wearing technical clothing that draws moisture away from your skin will help, along with some kind of barrier cream. Personally, I use bodyglide as I find it easy to apply, but vaseline or nappy rash cream should work just as well. 

So it's legal to use to ride one on the road in the UK. Cycle paths are a bit more complicated as some legislation refers to "bicycles" and some to "pedal cycles", so it would depend on how many wheels you've got and what type of cycle path / cycle lane / cycle track you wanted to use. If you want to use a velomobile or recumbent bike on the road between sunset and sunrise then you may have problems. To be legal you'd need 2 pedal reflectors on each pedal and these have to be clearly visible from the front and rear. The design of most velomobiles and recumbent bikes do not meet this requirement. This law is rarely (if ever) enforced, I think your main worry on this point is if you were involved in an accident then the other party might try to use your lack of reflectors to show negligence. Note - If your velomobile or recumbent bike is electrically powered then there are additional regulations that must be complied with, but I think that's beyond the scope of the question. 

Try a Garden Centre, they usually sell a range of trays and they should have something suitable. An example would be this "Giant Plus Garden Tray" which at 120cm x 55cm should be big enough to place a bike on. 

It depends. If the threads on the inside of the tyre are not damaged, only check for any left-over glass debris in the gash and leave as-is. Otherwise, either ditch the tyre or boot it from the inside, like @Batman suggested already. 

I found that at least here in Germany, most drivers are confused by trying to wave them by. Same goes for drivers in oncoming traffic that want to go left (across my lane) that I try to wave across when my traffic lights turn red. My strategy is taking "primary position" or even closer to the middle line when overtaking is either not a good idea or if there is enough space (maybe an additional lane) that would allow easy overtaking. I only move towards the curb when the road is visible for a longer stretch and overtaking safely is definitely possible. This is to avoid being pushed against the curb when an overtaking car has to terminate its manoeuvre prematurely due to oncoming traffic. However, most drivers seem to ignore this signal as well, either overtaking regardless of the traffic situation or not overtaking at all. Note though that I mostly ride a velomobile, so the UFO effect is far more pronounced than with any other type of bicycle. 

My fixie started out with Mavic CXP33 ("normal") rims. At some point I switched to Rigida DP18 rims on the same hubs. The reasons for switching were mostly style-related. The DP18's are not really "Deep V", but a lot deeper than the CXP33. Subjectively, the CXP33 were weaker, i.e. went out-of-true more often, but a cursory google'ing showed that these rims seemed to be weak even compared to other "normal" rims. I didn't notice any difference in handling, but that's not really surprising as my fixie is my commuting bike and the cities I lived in all had a lot of traffic lights, so building up high speeds was nearly impossible. Having built a couple of wheels, I suspect building a wheel with Deep Vs and large-flange hubs really is a PITA. If using traditional three-cross lacing, the spoke-to-flange angles will probably be problematic, too.
