What about a Bussard Ramjet for power and propulsion? I don't know if this would work in reality, but it's been used in enough SF novels that I'd accept it as a reader. Quick definition: When the ship is going fast enough, a magnetic shield/funnel takes hydrogen ions from "empty" space and compresses them until they fuse. In some stories they use excess to refill their fuel tanks. And you do need fuel, since the ramjet doesn't work until you're going fast enough. Examples of stories that use it: "Tau Zero" by Poul Anderson, and many of the early Known Space stories by Larry Nivens (the Pak used them also). How could I forget this one, "Mayflies" by Kevin O'Donnel, a story about a generation ship. Mayflies follows the generation ship from the start to the finish of the journey, though the POV jumps in time so you get to see major societal changes that occur during their extremely long trip (the ramjet got turned off early and couldn't be turned back on again until near the end of the book). The ship was huge, and like yours started from a relatively small population and it grew. I don't remember what the target population was though. 

First, one comment: The question sounds as if the magic from D and D is being used, rather than a magic system more useful for a book. A lot will depend on the cost of magic, or rather the mages that cast combat spells. If they are expensive, this serves the defender who can offer a mage a comfortable living environment and good pay for little work only in defense. If the magic includes clairvoyance and other ways of information-gathering, then it will be difficult to sneak up on a city defended by mages. One thing that I've seen few books address is that tactics would change if magic is a part of war. If fireballs are so useful against a stone wall (not that I think they would), then the walls would be built differently. They would be warded. Perhaps the very shape of the walls would be different to reflect the difference in combat. Likewise, the concept of a siege might change. If there are ways for the defending mages to produce food and water for the people, a traditional siege might take too long for the attacker to use. It might come down to magical battles between the two groups of mages. And, given powerful mages (why aren't they ruling the world already?), I would think the attacker would do better sneaking in a mage or two before he brings his army in. Then the attacking mage that is now inside can wreck havoc and let loose whatever he has. Or perhaps the attacker could buy/extort one of the defending mages with the same result. Even worse than fireball would be some form of teleportation. I cringe at stories where the spell for teleporation is unlimited. I can think of so many ways to use this in combat that it would change everything. 

There are no "similar waves" we just see the three base colors (RGB) becasue we have three types of color receptors. We have receptors for three, many other mammals have two base color, birds and reptiles see four base colors, some arthropods have a dozen. the number of different types of photoreceptors in the eye determine the number of colors you see, not anything about the light. organisms can have more base colors and will literally see more colors in the same stretch of the spectrum we see. The opposite is true as well red and orange are the same color to dogs just as there are several colors inside green to things that have multiple different types of "green" photoreceptors. Colors are not created by light they are created by how our eyes sense light. Distinct colors will exist everywhere on the spectrum for eyes that can see them. The rainbow never stops just our ability to see it. There are more diverse rainbows inside out rainbow that we can not see. We are all almost completely colorblind, even with the narrow visible spectrum we can't see most of the colors. 

just use mine airflow as guide. For heavy exertion humans need a bout 65 liters of fresh air a minute. if they are just walking around they need only 14. the most important factor is what kind of activity level are people doing and how many people are there. But in short no matter what the answer they are probably going to need a few fans. $URL$ $URL$ 

Justification is easy, they evolved on different continents, or in different environments like Chris's fresh vs salt. perhaps the "vipers" like more semi-aquatic than aquatic, like something on this list. Swamp monkeys or marine otters might be good inspiration. The anatomy is the big issue, gills have two problems. First getting gills on a primate is not going to happen, the best you will get is something like whales that can hold their breath for a long time. there is no gas permeable tissue to work with on the outside of the body of mammals. You need magical intervention or genetic engineering for gills. The second problem is they are way too small, to breath through them they would need to be as large as the chest cavity, air contains more oxygen than seawater. Our lungs are huge, the gills need to be even bigger than that. 

Anything, or anyone, seeking to exterminate humanity is going to have a war on their hands. If governments think there is a serious, existential threat they will almost certainly use any and all means at their disposal to stop it. The continued existence of every species besides us cannot plausibly be guaranteed in that scenario. There are a number of species that depend on us for survival. These include domesticated species and critically endangered species that are currently kept alive by human effort. Anything that wiped us out would also have to take our roles as caretakers for these species. If the plot relies on people to work, it is almost certain to fail in any even remotely plausible scenario. Humans are insanely hard to kill as a species. Any expedient means of doing so(meteor, nukes, etc) will certainly have collateral damage. Any methodical means of doing so will result in #1 happening. 

Is specific to humans. There is no protection from it or, if there is, it is so difficult that not enough humans will remain to repopulate. Acts swiftly enough that species under our care won't go extinct before replacement caretakers are put in place. Is global in scope and, moreover, is capable of affecting people living in extremely remote areas. 

Your question is broad and depends heavily on the degree of realism you are striving for as well as the agent of this destruction. For degrees of realism, I will break it down into three categories: realistic, plausible, and fantastical. For the agent of destruction I will go with just two categories: internal and external. Realistic scenarios are ones that could actually take place here in reality. Plausible scenarios are ones that would take extraordinary circumstances but are still fall within known natural laws. Fantastical scenarios are ones involving the supernatural or technology so advanced from our prospective that it may as well be. Internal agents of destruction would be ourselves, our technology, and the Earth itself. External agents of destruction include anything not of this world or dimension. With all that being said, here is a rough outline of scenarios: Internal/Realistic: There is no scenario I can conceive of now, or in the foreseeable future, that would allow this to happen. Any attempt would have to involve hundreds, if not thousands of people, working in secret to set their plan up. This would be true regardless of whether you're talking about bio-weapons, or straightforward genocide via extermination camps. These people would ALL have to be so fanatically devoted to your cause that they'd be willing to murder their families and friends. Remember, there are more than 7 billion people alive today and all it would take is for a few hundred of them to slip through the cracks for any extinction plan to fail. External/Realistic: I still cannot think of a scenario that will satisfy the requirement of "not affecting plants, other animals, etc". Any cosmic event (meteor, gamma-ray burst, sun exploding, etc) of a magnitude sufficient to exterminate all of mankind would take the majority of plant and animal species with us. Internal/Plausible: An ecological terrorist hatches up a scheme to exterminate mankind. He is a wealthy multi-billionaire so is able to independently hire crack teams of geneticists, biochemists, and other scientists necessary to create a gene-knockout virus that would render humanity sterile. He carefully compartmentalizes the teams so that none of them can share information with each other so nobody knows what the "big picture" ultimately is. He leads top lieutenants to believe that he is going to wipe out everyone else and they, and their families, will be spared. When the virus is ready, he devises some means of near-universal dispersal to disseminate the virus discretely. He would have approximately one, maybe two years at most to do this before people caught on to the fact that nobody was able to have children. At this point, it'd be a race to see if the combined efforts of every health organization on Earth could undo the efforts of his scientists before the last woman hits menopause. This plan also gambles on the virus not mutating sufficiently to become benign or having a tiny percentage of the population that is immune (even if it's 99.9999% effective there would still be more than 7,000 people remaining who could repopulate). External/Plausible: Intelligent alien life, if it exists, could either do the internal scenario described before. Or they could dispatch millions of tiny, insanely fast drones to relentlessly hunt down every human they run across. Alternatively, if they're more benevolent and have the means to do so, they could persuade or coerce humans to leave on massive evacuation shuttles. They could use their drones to make sure there were no straggling bushmen in Papua New Guinea or wherever else. Internal/Fantastical: We're entirely outside the bounds of reality so do whatever you like. Here are some ideas: a mad cultist of an alien god uses an artifact of doom, humanity learns the secrets of ultimate enlightenment and ascends to a higher plane of existence, a mad scientists cooks up the ultimate bio weapon against humanity and has his faithful robots disperse it. External/Fantastical: Again, we're outside of reality here so do as you will. Here are some ideas: humanity is pulled into another dimension by some mysterious entity, a cosmic anomaly that emits plot-waves swings by Earth and wipes out all sapient life, a powerful entity wishes us out of existence. Regardless of the path you take, there are some key points that need to be addressed: 

above ~70 km/s an impact causes any material being hit to vaporize (literally converted into a gas), this creates a secondary pressure wave thus creating an explosion just as detonating an explosive like TNT does. In thicker materials it creates an accompanying crater as the partially and completely molten material further away from the impact point is pushed out of the way by the pressure wave. There is quite a bit of wiggle room depending on the masses and materials in question. Some estimates say this can occur in rock at as little as 20km/s. At lower velocities the impact forces just creates a spray of molten material pushed away by the inertial forces creating a crater but not a real explosion. $URL$ 

As military vehicles never, as extraction equipment the military needs to defend sure, mining is already pushing for bigger and bigger machines as they are more cost effective. maybe the vehicles are really mobile refineries and just carry armaments becasue the are targets. Would help explain why they are on such a planet in the first place. 

The scientific community will actually be protecting them not the other way around. If they are sapient and intelligent that alone will go a long way, provided they have a dialog with humans. Scientists do not act as they are portrayed in movies. Modern science has some really strict ethics about how to treat sapient creatures, and consent laws will almost certainly apply here. Now scientists are going to WANT to investigate and will probably never stop trying to negotiate research deals with said creatures, but modern scientific ethics will keep it strictly voluntary and on the creatures terms. More importantly the scientists will want to go to them in their natural conditions not capture them, they will be just as interested in their culture as their biology. Just look at modern anthropology minimal interference and maximum consent is tantamount. As an example you can look at the sentinel island peoples who have zero contact with the outside world because they don't want any. The consent of the patients involved is essential. Now this is only going to go so far, if one of them dies on the streets of a city the scientific community will be all over it like flies on a carcass. And if they are trading with humans then there will be scientists constantly asking to study them and their culture, with varying levels of bribery to achieve it. Part of it is dependent on where they live and how easy it is to get to, if it is very easy to get to you will have poaching. If they are near a dictatorship or country with little respect for individual rights they will be captured. This goes double if the enter such a country. But if they are only reachable through countries that respect individual rights (the majority of countries) they should be fairly well protected. There will be incidents but they will be rare. Your biggest issue will be military investigation, the military had better be sure they cannot pass for human, or they will consider them a threat, and will investigate. You should also make first contact very recent, because the ethics of the past was very, VERY different. You may also want to consider how to keep one of the creatures from volunteering for research given that the will likely be offered millions of dollars for some scans, tissue samples, and demonstrations.
