Yes this is normal wording for all companies I have worked for for the last few decades. You are being hired as a programmer. The company wants to make sure that the time and money they invest in you doesn't result in you making the next killer app. Is this fair? Is this overly aggressive? Will this hold up in a court of law? No idea. In fact you will see similar clauses when you actually start working on a contract with a customer, they want to make sure that their project does give you an idea to make you a millionaire and put them out of business. 

You could base the answer from project B on what you wrote for project A. I would not forward the email chain because you could expose email addresses, contact information, or other confidential information included in the email chain. I would start my answer with a phrase such a: a few years ago; or on an earlier project. And then write the new answer. The opening statement gives the context that you have seen this type of problem before. The effort of paraphrasing and restating the answer means that you are making sure that your answer truly applies to the new project. It can be embarrassing if the copy and pasted answer includes an obvious error that proves you just copied and pasted the answer. 

That is always the hidden cost of systematic pay raises. If an employee with more time with the company feels that they are not adequately compensated for that additional experience, you have diminished their desire to stay loyal. Legality is another issue. It all depends on if there are contracts and what do they say. In the United States contracts for K-12 teachers specify the rates for all the teachers working in the school district, so all would be aware of the issue. Therefore the negotiators have to address the issue. If the county said we have to increase the offer for the new teachers so that they make almost as much as a teacher with 5 years, they know that the teachers/union will want to address the issue. But in the US there aren't big union contracts for college/university professors. Therefore there is nobody to force the employer to adjust all processors salaries. Management has to be aware of the issue. They just might have decided that the risk of losing those with 3+ years experience is an acceptable risk based on their budget, and their need to hire quality workers. 

This why you shouldn't send any money to the insurance company. They had/have a contract with your former employer. Every month they exchange funds depending on the number of employees covered that month, and any other fees. You are not privy to how partial months are addressed, nor are you sure if the company is self insuring so the actual premiums may have fixed part and a flexible part. The amount that is withheld from your paycheck is an agreement between you and your employer. They can withhold anything from 0% to 100%, and it can even depend on if you have employee only, employee + spouse, or family. The insurance company has no idea how much should have been taken from your paycheck. If they believe the employer owes them more money, that is not your concern. If the employer failed to withhold money they should have, that is between you and your employer. Therefore the insurance company should not be contacting you... 

Now it would be a state or city law that would apply if the court was at that level, but the wording would be similar. This is from a jury brochure from the state of California: 

Unless the employer is asking for information they can't legally ask, you must realize that failure to answer a question, or answering it in a vague way, can get you eliminated even before the interview Imagine this scenario: 

Always answer with the truth crafted around what the job description says are the required and optional skills. If there is no doubt that the key to the job is that expert knowledge of C++ now; then they may be unwilling to wait 2-3 months- but they might. If it is a matter of being rusty - tell them that. If it is a matter of only using it in one class 10 years ago - tell them that. Of course being rusty shows that you used to have proficiency, while only using it in one class leaves doubt in your ability to become an expert. If it is on a long list of nice-to-haves then your proposed answer is likely to be what they expect to hear about many (most?) of the items on the list. they know that nobody has everything on the list. Past proficiency is great, some exposure is also fine. 

Because you will be putting in your two week notice the day after verifying that the bonus has been deposited in the bank you are probably fine. You will have to make sure that there isn't some other requirement such as staying a certain amount of time after the bonus is received. You should not be putting in notice until the written offer from the new company has been signed and returned. Therefore they won't be in a position to give you a bad reference to the new employer. Many companies as a matter of policy don't give references beyond confirming dates of employment, which in your case is perfect. If they tell employees that the company does employment verification through a third party that is a sign that they only give basic info when potential employers call for a reference. The raise is a non-issue because the higher rate of pay stops on your last day of work. 

The calculus when looking for a new job includes salary, benefits, commuting time and costs, and the transition costs. These transition costs for include insurance deductibles, sick and vacation balances, moving expenses,and tuition repayment. You need to decide what salary, benefits, and bonus levels you need to cover your requirements. When they ask about salary you need to address all aspects. If you have a limited number of weeks to payback 12,000 then you need to let them know. Because if they can't come up with enough bonus you may have to wait a year for the waiting period to expire. 

The text description will give lengths of trips if they are longer than a week. Remember 25% is also 3 month long trips a year. Also pay attention to see if it involves international travel. Look for companies that have contracts with the government. 

The switch from w2 to 1099 is not to be taken lightly. The company will no longer be able to say you will sit at this desk x hours per week, and they can't give you explicit instructions regarding what to work on each day. They will have to negotiate a contract with you regarding the goal of your work, you will have to determine the hours required to complete that task and the schedule for doing so. They will now be your customer. The IRS doesn't take kindly when a person is listed as a 1099, when they should be a W2. This was true ever before the Affordable Care Act. 

Usually they will specify the ones that you are required to have. While this includes certifications for some jobs, it can include other requirements as well. These include education, overall years experience, years experience with a technology, or years in a specific position. Lack of these requirements being met on the application or on the resume can stop the process at the first hurdle. Frequently they have these requirements because they are hiring for a specific position on a specific contract. The customer will allow the company to bill X$ an hour for senior developer (BS+10, or MS+5) but only (X-Y)$ for a junior developer. In some cases that can mean they can't pay you what you want, or even put you in the position. For the requirements that are easy to screen, not having them can prevent you from getting an interview. The others can be addressed if you get to the interview stage. The decision to apply is dependent on the desire you have for that job/company, and the amount of effort it will take to apply. 

This answer is without knowing the details of your contract and notice period. The reason for a notice period is to give the company enough time for you to clean up the items you are working on. They generally don't have enough time to hire an outside person and have you train them, because that person will probably have a notice period also. Your quitting, un-quitting, and now quitting again doesn't remove the obligation to serve a notice period. They still want you to finish up your projects, and prepare to handover your responsibilities. But they also may decide to end your employment as soon as they can. You might even find yourself unemployed the day you tell them. All depending on the terms of your contract. They could also decide to make you work every bit of that notice period. There is nothing you can probably say to make this better. Either you made promises to them when you un-quit, or management made promises to their boss when they took you back; and now those promises are about to be broken. Planning on explaining why you have to leave now, may make you feel better. But it is unlikely that the company will agree with you. The general advice given to employees is that they shouldn't accept a counteroffer to stay. The advice is the same for employers: an employee that accepts a counter-offer is expected to leave within a year. 

Most employers I know don't allow the use of vacation during the two week notice period. Those 10 working days are to be used to training a replacement, but more likely to document their tasks, clean up what they can and then train a member of the staff. But these companies also paid the departing employee for unused vacation or unused Paid time off (PTO) if it was combined with sick into one pool. The employee would rather preserve their vacation hours to make that departing check as big as possible. In cases where they didn't get paid for unused vacation what was seen is telling the boss they were quitting right after returning from a few days off. They at least got a few days to run errands paid for by the boss. These days were between when they signed the offer letter and when they told the company they were leaving. Unless you know they are looking there is no way to prevent the second situation. In the first case negotiate the end date if they are taking a week off in the middle of the notice period. If they keep calling in "sick" during the notice period, and you are in an at-will state you could decide to terminate their employment early. But the risk is that they will leave the transition a mess.
