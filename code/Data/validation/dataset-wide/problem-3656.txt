IF the sessions you mention are done every day, then the answer probably is, that you have too little rest. Muscle needs rest to be able to recuperate and grow. Usually muscle won't grow properly if you do the same muscle group exercises 2 days in a row, but twice a day could actually diminish your muscle mass more than they grow. Therefore, You should try giving your muscles some time to recuperate, probably at least a day before another hard workout for that particular muscle group. As for the legs, I don't see any lower body exercises on the list. Sure, the amount of cardio you are doing is great for the overall body fat level to drop, but is not enough for your legs. It may be the case, that there is actually quite little fat on your buttocks and legs, but it just looks a lot because of lack of muscle. Either case, you should introduce some lower body exercises in your training programm. At least some squats and deadlifts. They should be the bare minimum to start growing your lower body. 

If your trying to move up in weight, try this. 15 reps at 10 lbs(This is your warm up set to get your form straight and wake up the muscles ) 10 reps at 15 lbs (This set adds a little more resistance but still light enough to maintain form) 6 reps at 25 (go all out on this one and see try and maintain form. ) If you did the last set ok, repeat the 6 reps at 25 lbs. The point of these rep ratios is to get your muscles in tune with good form. Once your muscles are warmed up you can start really lifting hard. keep adding to the reps on the last set and soon you'll be doing 25 lbs for ten reps. 

Your protein levels are usually low after a work out. same with everything else. So your body absorbs pretty much everything(almost everything) your put in it. Look up post work out meals and nutrition. Optimum Nutrition makes a protein specifically for after workout shake. It's called Hydrolized Whey. When your protein levels are low your body can go into a catabolic state so it's important to re fuel to stay anabolic. 

If it is bodybuilding/weight-lifting that you are doing, it is probably best to do a quick (1 exercise) stretch after the warm-up cardio, and then do some stretches in between exercises. What this does is stretch the fascia of muscle, therefore giving it more space to grow. This is heavily used in the FST-7 training method. 

If pure weight loss is what youre after ( and I mean just kg/pounds, not fat loss), then that extra hoodie could help you. Amy Nutt makes a great point about heat and weightloss. Sweating helps body get rid of the salts. And as we know, salt, besides making our food taste different, has the side effect of lessening the water throughput of your body. In other words, it keeps the water inside the body, therefore increasing, or certainly not lessening, your bodyweight. And if we assume, that you are on a good diet, there should be quite a small intake of salt, so there will be initial gains, but not in the long run. It may help you loose those first couple of kg/lbs that people are so ecstatic about, but will not help your weight loss in the long run. 

The simplest answer is to find something that you like to do that makes you more active than you are now, and then do it. Maybe it's working out with friends, or playing sports, or flying a kite, or arm wrestling. Doesn't much matter what it is, as long as it: 

Another good way to increase speed is to do whatever sequence of punching/striking moves you normally do with hand weights, slowly. Remove weights and do it as fast as you can. Hand weights back on, slow. Off, quick. Do that three times and you'll be amazed at the change. Note: We did this in my martial arts class yesterday, and it made a dramatic improvement in speed. Another Note: I would think that this same technique would be effective with a sequence of kicking exercises as well. 

You often hear people say "My muscle turned into fat" to explain why they used to be strong and in shape but now they are on the somewhat rotund side. My question is how does that transition actually happen? Do your muscle fibers really "turn into" fat in any way, or is it only the slow decrease of muscle through lack of use, and increase of fat through bad eating habits? 

This one has been bothering me for a while. Because of the strict diets, almost nobody who's training is allowed to drink any alcohol. A couple of my friends have turned to marijuana to get that Friday night high. Now I am wondering, what impact does marijuana have on the progress of the user? 

So I am on this 12 week transformation by Kris Gethin, and I am supposed to do 20mins of cardio twice a day, every day. So I'm thinking of alternatives of climbing stairs, running ,etc. So I thought - could sex be a form of cardio? Having sex for 20mins twice a day would be waaaay more pleasant and not as monotonous as running :) 

I think there is just one advice that can be given in this case: See a doctor! Anything else would be plain bad for you. This is something that cannot be answered correctly without a physical exam. It is clear, that this "clicking" is not something that should be happening normally and should be taken care of by a professional. 

Look up Pitbull from strength cartel. He competes at 160 weight class and moves unbelievable amounts of weight. He's probably just as strong as Rich Piana. If you want to get strong, You should look into power lifting routines instead. I know you mentioned Rich Piana who is a bodybuilder. His goals aren't to get strong but to get big. Calorie surplus does help ALOT too. 

I had a similar problem with elliptical machines for cardio training. My leg muscles became very used to the movement so it became hard for me increase my heart rate. I realized that there are two points of power to make the elliptical spin: from your legs pushing on the pedals, and from your arms pushing and pulling on the handles. I was very dominant with my legs so I tried to focus more energy on pulling and pushing from the arm handles. This definitely changed the dynamics for endurance resulting in my heart rate jumping in a short amount of time which was my goal. In short, you can adjust the amount of energy you are using from your legs to your arms or vise versa to add difficulty depending on your current strengths. 

I know, that there is the standard 8x8oz glasses or ~ 3 liters of water per day. But today I read, that since about 75% of muscle is water, people using their muscles intensively need more water, about two times as much as standard. So my question is: at which point does more become too much? How much water can I drink before I start hurting my kidneys? Background: I'm currently drinking about 5 liters of water per day if training, about 4 if on rest. 

Since I started my new job about 1,5months ago, I've been conveniently located near the water cooler. This means, that I get plenty of water. Waaay more than 8 glasses per day. And now here's my question: Should I be drinking hot or cold water? Kris Gethin suggested drinking cold water, since that makes your body spend more energy on heating the water up, thus creating a bit more of a calorie deficiency while dieting. On the other hand, I've read a couple of articles online, that suggest, that drinking hot water somehow helps purify the body, and helps one to stay awake. Which of these should I drink and why? 

I've found that if you eat the same amount of calories (or close to the recommended amount if you're working out) but change the combination of what you eat, you will lose weight. I've had great success with that - swapping out much of the empty carbs I was eating for protein and complex carbs in the form of vegetables and high-fiber carbs. Futhermore, I'm rarely ever hungry (except after a really good workout). 

I pulled my psoas a few months ago and saw a doctor. He recommended doing the following stretch: Lie down inside a doorway, with your hips even with the doorframe. Lift your left leg and place it against the wall on the right side of the door, keeping your back flat against the floor. You can scoot forward or backwards on the floor to increase or decrease the stretch. Repeat on the other side. It seemed to work for really focusing on that tendon and stretching it out gently. 

Your optimal grip is that perfect medium between to close and too wide. You'll know it's the right grip because you'll feel a dominant chest contraction. If your grip is too close you'll feel it in your arms. If your grip is too wide you'll feel it in your front delts. Close grip bench press is great for triceps. It works well with the incline variation too. Wide grip bench press is very dangerous. It puts too much direct tension on the front delts that don't have alot of strength in the bench position. This can cause a tear in the delt or a rotator cuff injury. This is a very serious injury that you don't want to ever deal with. SO.... depending on what muscle you want to target, inter change a regular grip and close grip. You'll know when your grip is too wide when you start feeling pain in the shoulders. 

In addition to the reasons mentioned by @sparafusile, I would also add that counting, especially out loud, encourages you to BREATHE while you do your situps. And breathing while doing crunches helps you to do more crunches. 

I attend regular martial arts classes (about 3-4 a week). We spend a lot of time stretching, particularly the hip area and the legs, to increase flexibility. Often after some classes where we do a lot of stretching, I find that the muscles/other soft tissues I don't know the name of/tendons I stretched are pretty sore. Is this a normal reaction to increasing flexibility? Should I view the soreness as evidence I'm becoming more flexible, or should I ease up a bit? EDIT: The general location of the soreness is the hip, psoas area (I'll try to roust up a picture later). It usually fades after a couple days, some ice/heat application speeds recovery. I have as yet not noticed any marked improvement in flexibility. 

There's a lot of weight training movements that can improve hamstring strength. I think a great one to get your legs back into condition collectively would be barbell squats and leg presses. Proper form is KEY if you want to activate your hamstrings. Make sure you keep all your weight in your heels and off your toes. 

This is a tip. I'm terrible at waking up so when I lift at 6am coffee or pre workout does wonders for me. Also stretching is very neccesary when lifting and running in the morning. Save yourself alot of injury and grief. 

Some men carry fat in their lower chest as body fat goes up(this applies to myself). So I notice I lose alot of lower pec definition when I'm bulking. You might fall into the same category. I like wider grip dips to get that lower contraction. You could set up something like that at home with some chairs.
