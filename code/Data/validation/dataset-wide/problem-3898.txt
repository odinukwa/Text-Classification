It is not an answer but it must have to do with the way our brain pick up a sample between a few ones. It must be the minimum of some function which can be implemented for real in the brain. I do not believe that there is a pure logical definition of "canonical" independently of the way our brain works. Experience : give me a number? What do you answer? 0 or 1 rarely $\pi$ or even 115674. The numbers 0 and 1 are canonical in some sense. Give me a basis of ${\bf R}^3$. The same holds $((1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1))$ I minimize the number of different digits and I pick them in my "basis" of canonical numbers. Well, interesting question. 

Actually the first case in history of a symplectic manifold wasn't a cotangent space. It was the space of Keplerian motions of a planet, represented locally by its Keplerian elements. The Lagrange symplectic structure on this space is defined by the so-called Lagrange parenthesis he introduced at this time (three papers in 1808/09/10)(*). That manifold is actually even non Hausdorff, but its greatest hausdorff quotient is a still a manifold (this is known as the "regularization theorem"). This manifold is symplectic but not a cotangent (but however contractible to the sphere $S^3$). Extended with the repulsive motions, it is an algebraic manifold defined by the following equations [Sou]. $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} ||{A}||^2 -fx^2 & = & 1 \\ y^2 - f ||{B}||^2 & = & 1 \end{array} \right. \quad \& \quad \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} A \cdot B - xy &=& 0 \\ xy - f\tau &=& 0, \end{array} \right. $$ where $A,B \in {\bf R}^3$ and $x,y,f,\tau$ belong to $\bf R$. Actually this manifold is the result of the gluing of $TS^3$ and $TH^3$ along $TS^2\times {\bf R}$ (where $H^3$ is the 3 dimensional pseudo-sphere). I made the following picture, for $A$ and $B$ in $\bf R$, to get a visual idea of the manifold. The bottom represents the $TS^3$ part, the top represents $TH^3$ and it is glued along two lines representing $TS^2\times {\bf R} \simeq S^2 \times {\bf R}^3$.                                   Remark. There exists also the examples of compact symplectic manifolds representing internal degrees of symmetries, as mentioned in Tobias answer. In the same spirit there is the Grassmannian manifolds ${\rm Gr}(2,n+1)$ of $2$-planes in ${\bf R}^{n+1}$, representing the space of un-parametrized geodesics on the sphere $S^n$. We can regard this space of geodesics as the space of light rays on the Euclidean sphere where the speed of light would be infinite. ---------- Edit March 28, 2017 On a conceptual point of view, I just finished to write a paper: Universal Structure Of Symplectic Manifolds $URL$ that proposes a way, based on diffeology, to understand the statement: "Every symplectic manifold is a coadjoint orbit". ---------- Notes (*) I published this paper on the origins of symplectic geometry, but in french, where Lagrange's construction is explained. ---------- Reference [Sou] Jean-Marie Souriau.

If it is just a question of definition but not a question of computation, I have heard when I was a student the following definition: Let $f$ be a real continuous function, class $C^0$. Let $$ \Delta f(x,x') = \frac{f(x') - f(x)}{x'-x} \quad\mbox{defined on}\quad {\bf R}^2 -\{x=x'\} $$ If $\Delta f$ admits a continuous extension on the diagonal $\{x=x'\}$ then it is unique, and $f$ is said to be of class $C^1$. The function $f'x) = \Delta f(x,x)$ is then called the derivative of $f$ Of course this is the standard definition, nothing new under the sun, but the $\epsilon-\delta$ calculus if hidden, and of course, not for long :-) 

Joseph-Louis Lagrange For his modesty as a human being, and his great mathematical work, on almost every field of mathematics, but especially in mechanics. 

I switched from theoretical physics to math, long time ago, it has been a very painful experience (and I had a double graduation). But after 20 years, now, it's OK ;-) I have a good friend who switched 10 years ago from math to neuro-sciences (he implements some differential geometry techniques in the modeling of the brain functioning). He is professor in some famous university in Paris, and he just published a 170 pages paper on his new subject. You can say that his switch has been successful. My experience is that if you really want to switch because it's what you like, then switch, but don't think it will be easy. And it will take time for you to be productive in your new field, a few years, think about the consequence on your career. If you just switch because you are tired of what you are doing now, be careful you will may be tired of your new field too :-/ 

BTW Frölicher spaces is equivalent to the full subcategory of what we call "reflexive diffeological spaces" (a work in progress with Y. Karshon and al), the ones whose diffeology is completely defined by the real smooth maps. They are the "intersection" of the category {Diffeology} and the category {Sikorski}. There are nice examples and counter-examples which illustrate the difference between these categories. 

Let $(M,\omega)$ be a symplectic manifold. The first idea behind geometric quantization is that there exists a $S^1$-principal fiber bundle $\pi : Y \to M$, equipped with a connection $\lambda$ with curvature $\omega$, that is, $d\lambda = \pi^*(\omega)$. Let $\xi$ be the vector field generating the $S^1$ action, then, for all $y \in Y$, $$ T_yY = \ker(\lambda_y) \oplus {\bf R} \xi(y). $$ Proof. From $d\lambda = \pi^*(\omega)$ you get immediately that ${\bf R} \xi \subset \ker(d\lambda)$. On the other hand, $d\lambda(u,v) = \omega(\pi_*(u),\pi_*(v))$, then $d\lambda(u,v) = 0$ for all $v$ and $\pi_*$ surjective implies $\omega(\pi_*(u),w)= 0$ for all $w$. Since $\omega$ is symplectic, $\pi_*(u)=0$. Thus $\ker(d\lambda) = \ker(\pi_*) = {\bf R}\xi$. Now, if $u \in \ker(\lambda) \cap \ker(d\lambda)$ then $u = a\xi$ and $\lambda(a\xi) =0$, but $\lambda (a\xi)= a \lambda(\xi) = a$, because $\lambda(\xi)=1$, therefore $a=0$, that is $u=0$ and the two subspaces $\ker(\lambda)$ and $\ker(d\lambda)$ are complementary. $\square$ In conclusion, every vector $\delta x \in T_xM$ has a "horizontal" lift $\delta y \in T_yY$, with $\pi(y) = x$, that is, $\delta y \in \ker(\lambda)$. Is that what you were wondering?
