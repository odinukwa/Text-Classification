It can take however long you want, and the faster it goes down, the more destruction it causes. What Happens Let's just assume that the planet was dry, and the water magically appeared. Maybe it fell from the sky (an inconceivable number of comets? Shell of ice around the earth?), but whatever happened, the entire planet is now covered with water. Now we have to get rid of the water again. Barring un-physical things, we have to drain the water somewhere. Now, here is the fastest way of draining the planet that I can think of: 

It largely depends on the aliens. If the first we hear of the aliens is a thermonuclear warhead vaporising major cities all over the world, then yes, there will be major panic. If they "come in peace" then there might be. However, unless the aliens have been studing Earth for a long time, they won't have a clue about earth's governments or public space institutions. And how do they approach NASA without the ESA hearing about it, or even some of the private rocket companies are probably likely to notice something. Your primary question is on how people would react, and the best way to analyse this is to assume that you are "normal." Figure out how you would react, and then spread peoples viewpoints along a spectrum. Or maybe pick a few friends who have different viewpoints to you (eg go find your nearest Christian), and ask what they would do/think. Just bear in mind that it does depend quite a lot on the specifics. For example: what if the aliens also had a religion. What if it matched one of ours? What if it didn't match any of them? 

Well, there you go. Hopefully that gave you some ideas about how a steam-powered revolver could work. I'll sign off with this video of a steam powered gun: $URL$ Where does your prosthetic arm fit? Well maybe it can provide the fuel for the burners. 

Spinning a drill-bit takes a lot of force, particularly one large enough to be a drum. I can't imagine a primitive society having the materials to do drill on that scale - it simply requires an unbelievable amount of force. Some sort of forging would be far far easier. Humans have been making cauldrons using casting for centuries. As for the water-wheel powered music box? Nothing hard there at all. The tines would have to be some fairly stiff steel though. However, cou can't make a nice "plucked" instrument with cast iron, although you could do bells. Of course, you do have the materials to make steel (iron + carbon), so if your industry is up for it then you could make a typical music box. Making it water powered is not hard at all. Finally, Larger = easier to make, although it also means lower pitched. I'd be fascinated to hear what a gigantic music box sounds like. 

Closely linked to both perception and manipulation is the environment. Living on a featureless white plane in the fog will send a human crazy. Living in a world that is nothing but random flashing lights will also drive him mad. To some extent evolution may compensate and the intelligence may adapt to it's environment, but I suspect many places can harbour life, but not tool-using-intelligent life. 

I have been considering something similar recently as part of hobby speculation regarding Artificial Intelligence: what are the fundamental requirements for technical intelligence. Because I've considered this lots, this may turn into an extremely long answer, but we'll see what happens eh? First up, some quick notes: 

They live at the a convenient watering place between two towns, just before you start entering the pass: 

So, unless the ship has an analysis engine (computer/AI/logic-core) far in advance of what we have, there is nearly zero chance of connecting to the internet. Of course, you could just "alien technology *handwave*" as everyone else does (and leave nerds wondering how a computer from 1996 can upload a virus to an alien mothership). The laptop your universal constructor gave you Fortunately your question said "something that emulated the functions of a PC" because I highly doubt that it would actually be anything like it. The current computer is the result of an iteration loop between human computer scientists and the silicon-based transistor. The architecture of a modern PC is so overwhelmingly specific to the task of running a modern program. So I imagine your universal constructor put out a computer-shaped package filled with whatever the aliens use for computing. It'll probably run better and crash less often, so don't complain about it. The downside is that it probably won't behave like you want. Assuming it was built from your [incomplete] memories of what a laptop does, it will approximate a significant amount of behaviour. When you enable the wifi if will light up a [not] LED and start emitting radio waves - because that's what you thought of as what happened when turning it on, but it won't be wifi. It'll show a loading screen when you turn it on, not because it needed to but because all computers you've used had them. It would be fascinating to ask a hundred people to describe a computer and how to build it, and then try to construct something based just on their description. I imagine it would be quite different to what we actually have! 

Muscle Mass. This isn't an issue if you are in zero or really-really tiny gravity, but I don't see this design working out in anything more than 1% G. There simply aren't muscles powerful enough. This is particularly an issue for the hip wings, but maybe those are just for more base guidance than for propulsion. Still has feet - despite the fact they would never be able to use them. I'd say the bones would be merged into the foot-wing-part rather than kept distinct. Still keep the two legs to provide flight control, but the feed are likely redundant. Some ankle-joint rework may also be required to give sufficient up elevator to pull out of dives (not that a dive really exists in micro-g) Face direction. I expect a winged humanoid to look in it's primary direction of travel. So the neck or skull may have to be redesigned to loop in the "upwards" (of a normal human) direction a bit more. Try looking vertically for a couple hours and you'll have a very stiff neck.... 

It would make for an interesting story, but as Samwise said, it would break lots of physics and math. I'll quickly point out this post on physics.stackexchange. In summary: if they change, we start looking for why they change. We create new "laws" to superseded the limitations of previous ones. So let's examine some effects of some constants changing (ignoring how or why they changed). 

The plant exudes from it's roots a natural antifreeze protien This soaks into the ground around the roots The ice around it melts, dropping the temperature of the ground The melted ice is absorbed by the roots The ground is reheated by conduction from other ground, or from radiation from the sun, or some other process not dependant on the plant. 

To block out the sun, the platform needs to appear sun-sized. My thumb (1cm) can block out the sun at arms length (100cm). Thus the rule of thumb is that an object that is sun-sized will be 100 times further away than it is large. (For proof, the sun is 1.4 million km diameter at 150 million km). As a result at your operational altitude of 10km, your platform will need to be a 100m disc. That's not unfeasible as the Hindenburg was 245 meters long. If you bolted three hindenburgs together (they are only 40m wide), you could block out the sun from 10km altitude. How much effect will that have on the temperature? Unfortunately, no-one seems to have studies on 100m shadecloths at high altidude. However, this study found that the shade of a tree tree dropped the air temperature by 0.6 - 2.5 degrees Celsius at mid-day, and the ground temperature by a massive 3.3 - 8.1 degrees. This implies that a 100m area of shade may well have a larger affect than I anticipated in earlier versions of this answer. However, to keep the spot of shade in the same place, your platform will have to move very rapidly to counter Earth's rotation. Your question states you want 100kmx100km. How big will that appear if it is at 40,000ft? It's only 10km up, so it's going to appear freaking massive. The sun appears with a 0.5 degree angular width. Your platform will have a ... 160 degree angular width. In other words, if you are directly under it, there will be a 10 degree ring of sun on the horizon. I could well accept that that will have significant affects on climate, considering that it's larger than most mountains..... Or if you mean 100 square kilometers (ie 10kmx10km) then your station is 'only' 60 degrees wide. Still pretty significant. Using it as a launch launch platform for rockets to orbit is not unfeasible either. There is a company doing airship to orbit, and they plan to have a station at 140,000 ft altitude. I wouldn't want rockets anywhere near my hydrogen gasbags, but I can't see why you couldn't have reasonably large areas without gasbags to permit this sort of thing. 

It's four hours from Christchurch and Nelson, so your car's on just over half a tank of gas when you go past. It's a nice place to stop for a leg-stretch and a snack. It's located nearby the Lewis Pass. 

So we're not that far off. Grab a couple hundred GPU's and you can be in the same order of magnitude. Why can't we (currently) simulate a brain in real time with a bunch of super-fast GPU's? I can think of a few reasons (Also see ZioByte's answer): 

Where did your army get 10,000 rabbits? Did they have a pre-sacrifice en-masse hunt? And your army just killed 10,000 kilos of meat they probably would rather have eaten. I tried looking for the average population of bunnies in a meadow and one source suggested there are 1-3 rabbits per hectare. So your army will need to harvest all the rabbits in at least 3000 hectares (30 square kilometers). I applaud their efforts - particularly because they caught these rabbits live so they could sacrifice them later. I would have enjoyed being a spectator for the hunt, watching all these fighting men leaping around trying to catch them..... You mention they 'receive' these rabbits, so maybe there is a nearby rabbit farm? Divine intervention of rabbit sending? Magicians pulling hoards of bunnies out of hats? But this is good material to spin legends from. Maybe it was only a hundred men against two hundred, and the mountain was a small rocky mound, but the story got exaggerated with each telling... 

How will religions change? In all three cases I suspect there will be a huge dip, but then they will come back. Most religions hinge upon belief in something not proven. (eg life after death). As a result, I imagine they'll survive the message of 'oh, there are are aliens now.' I would even predict evangelists from various religions trying to convert the aliens. Nothing wrong with that. Do modern religions have aliens in them? How would they change? There would some huge questions raised, and theologians would have a tough time, but would probably end up finding evidence for the existence of the aliens in their religious texts. For example, in Genesis 6:4 (NIV version) you see: 

Figuring out the breeding times With 600 people you're dead. There's a fun article here, and it states that you need around 10,000 for sufficient genertic diversity. Barring issues with that (eg maybe they are genetically engineered people to not have issues with inbreeding) then it's a case of time. Pulling some numbers from wikipedia, the human population went from 2 billion in 1927 to 4 billion in 1974. That means it doubled in about 50 years. A quick sanity check says it took 40 years to go from 3 to 6 billion. Close enough. For three 1.6 million population cities, we probably require another equal amount in farmers. So let's assume we need to get up to, say, 10 million people. This is doubling 600 a hair over 14 times. At 50 years per doubling it's a total of around 700 years. However you specify 500 million people as a "good target". A little more math and out pops the number 20 generations, or 1000 years. 

These plants are relatively rare, and do not like growing near each other (as the cooling of the ground caused by other similar plants hinders their antifreeze), and prefer areas where the ground is maintained at a constant temperature by some external source (eg near inhabited buildings, near flowing rivers or the sea - both of which are excellent heat(cold) sinks for the ground temperature). One limitation of this system is that ice-chunks in the soil are not easily replaced. Once the ice near to the roots is gone, so is the source of water for the plant. This means either:
