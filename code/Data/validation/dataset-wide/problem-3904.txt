the coproduct of all the sets $Hom(X,F(i))$, quotiented by the relation $\sim$ defined by: for $f \colon X \to F(i)$ and $g \colon X \to F(i')$, take $f \sim g$ if there is some $i''$ and a commutative square as in your original post.* 

If you want your logic to be classical (i.e. to validate principles like the law of double negation), then as Emil Jeřábek says in comments, you can derive disjunction in terms of implication as $\varphi \lor \psi := (\varphi \to \psi) \to \psi$. Generally, in classical logics, there are so many ways to interdefine the connectives that it’s hard to give a not-too-weak system that doesn’t imply the full usual system. On the other hand, if you are happy for your logic to end up constructive/intuitionistic (i.e. not be able to prove the law of double negation, excluded middle, etc), then yes, logics of this sort have been studied. The two I’m most familiar with that omit disjunction are regular logic and the fragment of Martin-Löf Type Theory valid in any LCCC (see Martin Hofmann, On the interpretation of type theory in locally cartesian closed categories), i.e. with just function types and product types. However, both of these sound like overkill for your case — what you outline sounds more like the conjunction-implication fragment of intuitionistic logic. The sequent caluclus presentation nicely separates the rules for the various connectives, so that each one still works fine in the absence of the others. I don’t know anywhere that this specific fragment has been studied/discussed, I’m afraid, though I would guess that it has been. Edit. Googling various groupings of the keywords , , , , turns up quite a few papers working with such systems, though I can’t find any single paper taking the system itself as its object of study. 

A toy example, using the Yoneda lemma: Claim: There are two canonical bialgebra structures (the “additive” and “multiplicative” structures) on $k[x]$, and one of them (the additive one) in fact makes it a Hopf algebra. Proof 1: (Calculation.) Write down the formulas; check the axioms! This isn't an especially long calculation, but it's a bit tedious; while seeing the formulas is nice, checking the axioms isn't (to my taste) especially enlightening. Proof 2: (Abstract.) “Bialgebra” = “comonoid in ($k$-Alg,$\otimes$)”. We know $k[x]$ is the free $k$-algebra on one generator, so there's a natural isomorphism $\mathrm{Hom}(k[x],A) \cong A$, for any $k$-algebra $A$. So $\mathrm{Hom}(k[x],A)$ is naturally an algebra — so it has two natural monoid structures, + and $\cdot$, and under + it's moreover a group. By Yoneda, these must correspond to two comonoid structures on $k[x]$, and the one corresponding to + must be Hopf! Now, what I really like about this proof is that it still connects closely to the computations. By the way that the Yoneda lemma works, you can read off what the two coalgebra structures actually are; but now you don't have to check the axioms, since you already know they hold! Also, you now know there'll be a “co-distributive law” connecting the two, which you might never have thought of just from the first approach… And also, this gives a way of looking for bialgebra structures on other algebras: look at what they classify/represent! This shows up, I think, a lot of the power of abstract approaches. They put formulas and calculations into a bigger picture; they can help you do interesting calculations, while letting you skip tedious ones; and they can suggest calculations you might not have thought of doing otherwise. But (as you can probably guess from that) I love calculation too: I wouldn't want either without the other. If abstract nonsense is the garden, concrete computations are the flowers. 

“HoTT” isn’t generally currently considered as referring to a single specific formal system — it’s a similar situation to, say, “constructive mathematics”, for which there are various different more or less well-studied formal systems. The core of most systems currently used for HoTT is Martin-Löf’s intensional type theory, ITT, usually also with funext. This is agnostic on homotopical questions: it has both the simplicial set model, where univalence holds, and the good old-fashioned set model, where UIP holds (“uniqueness of identity proofs” — in HoTT terminology, the statement/scheme asserting that every type is a set), and (at least as long as you’re working with ZFC or similar as your background foundation) LEM∞ holds as well. So in this case, LEM∞ certainly can hold — but it’s not what one would usually call a model of HoTT. On the other hand, you might mean a stronger system — ITT augmented with some homotopical axioms, like univalence. In this case, because of the results you mention, there can’t be any model where LEM∞ holds. One reasonable in-between thing one might mean by “models of HoTT” would be: models of ITT in which UIP doesn’t hold, i.e. models which are “homotopically non-trivial”. For this sense, the answer to your question is no, LEM∞ can’t hold in such models, since Hedberg’s Theorem shows that LEM∞ implies UIP, so any model of ITT + LEM∞ is homotopically trivial. 

This does exist, and has a nice explicit description. Treating the sets $A_i$, for convenience, as disjoint subsets of $A$, take a subset $S \subseteq A$ to be measurable exactly if $S \cap A_i$ is a measurable subset of $A_i$, for each $i$. The proof that this is a sigma-algebra making each $\psi_i$ measurable, and is the finest such, is reasonably straightforward. From a categorical point of view, one can find this description by saying: if such a σ-algebra exists, one would hope that it should make $A$ a coproduct of the $A_i$'s in the category of measurable spaces. But measurable subsets $S \subseteq A$ must correspond to measurable functions $f \colon A \to 2$ (this holds for any measurable space); hence, by the universal property of $A$, to families of functions $f_i \colon A_i \to 2$; hence to families of measurable sets $S_i \subseteq A_i$; thinking about naturality shows that this correspondence has to be via $S \mapsto (A \cap S_i)_{i \in I}$, and so leads to the description above. (And one can check then that this does indeed give a coproduct.) One can see this as talking about a duality between the category of measurable spaces and a suitable category of lattices: the coproduct as spaces corresponds to the product of the lattices of measurable subsets. I have no references, I’m afraid, since I don’t know of any categorically-minded treatments of measure theory. But any such book would surely include this construction; I’m hopeful that there’s one out there that I don’t know of? 

Dan Licata, Mitchell Riley, and Mike Shulman have recently proposed a rather general answer to this, in A Fibrational Framework for Substructural and Modal Logics (extended preprint). This probably isn’t the main answer you want, for several reasons — it’s long and fairly dense, and more significantly, the logics and categorical structures it gives are not the ones you might first hope for, since they (a) must be presented in the style of the general framework, and (b) the categorical structure will directly and ‘naïvely’ mirror the structural rules of the logic, rather than being repackaged into some neater equivalent form. However, the references cited in that article form an excellent entry point to the literature on categorical semantics of substructural logics, and should help to find the more direct answers you really want.
