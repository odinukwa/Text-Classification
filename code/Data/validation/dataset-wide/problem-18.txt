A thing to recall is that the language contructs available often largely dictate the thought patterns available to a society (and partially the other way around). Thus, if these aliens are truly only concerned with the immediate do not provide them with constructs that detail time. Any time into the future may be "tomorrow", while any time before now may be "in memory". Further, it may be worth considering whether a codified grammar matters. In real life, few concerned themselves with grammar until laws came into place that had to be unambigiously interpreted. That may again not be a concern for these aliens. Finally, if there is truly a large hunting aspect to these creatues; consider that their language may not be fully vocal. Sign languages were often used to not give away one's position, while whistling languages are very practical for communicating over much longer distances than shouting (comfortably) could. 

The main practical advantages of airships are their relative ease of operation (landing in particular) and their ability to operate at low velocities. A core method to reach the velocity necessary to make airplanes work is combustion. Therefore, an early shortage of fossil fuels would certainly stretch the age of airships, possibly indefinitely. 

Consider how we interact with ants. One way we interact with ants is through surrogates. Watch a child investigating ants. He mostly doesn't poke them directly. Instead, he pokes them with a blade of grass, perhaps with a dead ant on the end, trying to get the two ants to "talk". He changes the ant's environment by removing its trail, and sometimes by moving it away from its familiar environment to a jar or tupperware container. In visual storytelling, this is usually represented by a blank white void or white room, as you see in 2001, the Matrix, etc. Don't do that. But it's important to remember that despite being ineffable to us, we may be equally inscrutable to the God - it may not even know we exist, nor, on knowing, might it have the least clue what our thoughts or beliefs are. But if it did want to communicate, it would communicate on our level, by changing our environment, or poking us with sticks. So, an Avatar or angel - a collection of whatever crap the god found around, crafted into some form of approximation for us. It might or might not be able to communicate with us. Most likely, if we were inscrutable to the God, it'd just make the avatar do stuff and see how we reacted. Eventually, a God interested enough to put the work into it, would be able to understand us, especially if we made an effort to communicate back, just as we can understand the basics of animal communication (back off! I'm hungry! I'm scared! I'm wounded! etc). The swirl of floating rocks and twigs would become more formed as the God understood us and our desires better. It might become an angelic statue. It might be a friendly or sexy human like thing. It might become a computer screen and keyboard. It might become a a rapidly descending shoe to stomp us out when it gets bored. 

Due to effects of lightwave interference, another light source passing through the laser COULD make it visible, but barely so (and certainly not as a line). A laser-like weapon such as superexcited matter is a far more likely candidate. 

The main issue you seem to be neglecting are the carriers of pollution. Flows of water and air and even the local rotational velocity of the earth (higher closer the equator) are vital factors in determining your answer. Air and water flows are mostly governed by climate and geographical features (which all in turn also influence each other, of course. Nobody said this would be simple). Interestingly, in real life many factories have smokestacks SO high that it is no problem at all for the communities they are serving, but the pollution actually comes down hundreds of kilometers away to cause smog. If your climate, flows and geography are relatively neutral and we ignore friendly-neighbor-policy smokestacks we can (greatly) simplify our models by assuming all plants pollute in a perfect circle with quadratic fall-off based on distance. At this point the model is so simple, unfortunately, that real-life data simply fails to accomodate. This does lend itself to heatmapping the area, and you can still use recorded smog and water polution levels in real life cities as reasonable benchmarks for tolerance. 

When placing and naming civilization markers on a map, we can follow some basic rules. Where rivers reach the coast, there will typically be at least some amount of tidal estuary and delta, so the coast should angle in a little there; unlike most bays, these will be sharp rather than rounded. Urbintor is a good example. Humans live on the water, and on trade routes, so the first (and probably oldest) cities should go anywhere a river joins the sea, like Markal, Porlat, Kesidi, Mestas, and Urbintor again - great trade and fishing. River forks are also good places for trade and water, too, as well as being nicely defensible, protected on two sides by a natural "moat": in this map, this seems to be one of the main reasons for placing cities. There's a great sheltered bay with two rivers leading from it, leading to Bloodhill and Latale. This bay would normally become a huge city pretty fast, unless there's a good reason for it not to. Probably the biggest in that continent. Bays are caused by erosion from the sea, so will typically be rounded (no examples on this map), rather than pointy (Distad, Dalere, Vantia City, Turrum, Minra, Dongan, Montibem, Pordeut, Todora, Estreor, Porlaba, Eastport...), unless they are fjords between two mountain ranges. Fjords will typically end in at least a short river. Names mean things, and those things get used in multiple other names: in Pordeut, Porlaba, Porlat - I'd suspect that the "por" is a degradation of "port", and "lat" has some meaning, as it's also seen in Latale. Eastport shows the word non-degraded, showing regional differences, which is nice. The same region (Kingsland) has BloodHill - that region seems defined by readable Englishy names. My suspicion is that this will be where the heroes will start out, and venture into more foreign-sounding places. A bit tropey, if so, but not a terrible thing. Outside of that southern continent, though, names seem like just 2-3 random-syllable things, with no clear sign of meaning. Having several river-fork cities have a similar prefix or suffix (-ford, -bridge), and so on, will add verisimilitude: see $URL$ but obviously, like your "por-", make them regionalized to the tongues of your world, rather than using them directly. As a counterpoint to that, for a fiction writer, having names which are easily confused by the reader (bannockburn, bannockbridge) is usually a bad thing. I'd go with having the first syllable unique in each case, and shared suffixes, unless the point is to show the two places are very close together (bannockburn being just upriver from bannockbridge, perhaps). As well as rivers, other trade routes matter - places where major roads join, mountain passes, etc. Also significant sources of resources, like mining town, fishing villages (the whole coast would normally be populated with these before inland areas got many towns), etc. I like the placement of Erten & Estreor, placed to take advantage of the trade that flows down that channel from Gahotere and the Vanlian empire, to Kingsland and southern Aumedeszel. 

As someone who medically lacks depth perception, I can assure you there's several ways your brain learns to automatically compensate: Scale of distant objects gets matched to the 'known' scale of such objects to roughly get the distance. 

Diverging/converging lines provide perspective. Truly, how does your depth perception work when viewing something on a flat screen which was shot with one 'eye' (camera)? It really isn't as debilitating as could be thought! 

LOOTING! You need to get on the ship to gather up the booty efficiently, lest it all just scatter into space. It'd still be possible to collect in that state, but much more cumbersome. 

It depends on how you define steam power Allow me to explain with the best example I have: Must nuclear reactors are extremely energy dense, but they ultimately use water-steam conversion to make practical use of the nuclear power in order to convert it to electrical power. In most cases there is a measure of steam recovery to close the cycle and either active or passive cooling of the steam to be able to re-use it. Is a nuclear powered cross-atlantic flight possible? Absolutely. So, in essence, that means a steam powered flight is. It just uses a far far less obvious fuel source. 

That line, I realized, was the one that felt most wrong to me. It doesn't work like that. Stuff gets cheaper. That swarm of pleasure craft is only going to get bigger as materials science and manufacture get more advanced and the craft become cheaper. Why would water ever become the domain only of "tycoons", rather than the birthright and pleasure dome of everyone who lives nearby? Perhaps if laws are passed to protect the water from the people - but even then they'll sneak in. Perhaps if the waters became dangerously polluted, then at least fishermen might no longer take to sea, and people wouldn't swim in it any more... but even then, people would cruise upon the waves, just not swim in them. As it becomes more crowded on land, the space and freedom of the open sea will become more and more intoxicating, and more and more people will be pushed to live there, some permanently. It's a valid solution to overpopulation. Sure, the wealthy might have their own ships, but link together a long enough bunch of cheap rafts connected with dynamos, and the wave power can generate electricity for the community.
