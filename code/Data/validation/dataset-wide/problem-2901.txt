There have been many answers to this question, and I suppose at this point, mine will be just another body on the pile, but I think there is something fundamental that hasn't been addressed (unless I missed it). That is: Who is this God you're talking about? Is he an old white man with a long beard who looks suspiciously like the archetypal authoritarian father we all have learned to love and fear? Or is it just the notion that there was a being who could be considered the first cause? Is it really just the notion that some people accept a literal notion of the bible (who I suspect are actually fewer than we've been led to believe)? Is it the traditional notion of God as the judge - he who controls our fate and promises to decide are afterlife after death? I'm neither religious nor positional about this issue. There are so many things that we can't fathom that it seems just as silly to argue that the absolute truth is empirically graspable (and only so) as it does to argue the alternative. Even our own thoughts are something we are helplessly unfamiliar with - I'm reminded of a Woody Allen quote: 

Because God wants us to be totally involved. So human have free will, can talk, behave and act; God wants our cooperation, because for a relation two persons are needed. Nevertheless God can give us something that we did't ask for, but this isn't always the case. 

According to his theory there is only one substance and that is God/Nature. But if God is only good can there be any evil or bad behavior etc.? 

Socrates was finally sentenced to death because his judges declared that he spoiled youth by his teachings and that he learned other Gods. But what precisely did he teach? 

There is time as an interval between two events but you could also state that time itself has a certain duration (it passes). Now in physics it is not always very common to see time as something that has a duration. ' So to make that statement solid one should find a way to work it out that it is an illusion but how can you do that? 

When you refer to the I of the past what are you referring to? Think on this question. What the I of the past is, and how it exists in the present is mostly in the form of a conversation. There is the present where the body is acting, but something is referencing the past in some fashion. As Douglas Hofstadter says in I Am A Strange Loop: 

We are who we are in the present as an illusion which is something like an infinite regress of self-reference. If we ask who we are now, we attempt to find ourselves in the past (everything is past - on the cutting edge of the present, there is nothing), but the me who I would find in the past doesn’t exist in any way that is real. In fact, if I look into the past for a definition, I can imagine a self that exists only in reference to some further past, ad infinitum. When considering a solid you, that which is considering only finds that there is no such thing. You can find yourself in the present as action, but then there is no you that is inserted between experience and action. There is only doing/being and the one doing/being is not something that has existence apart from the doing / being itself. Self is not a fixed thing that exists with substance. If so, touch it/point to it. The only place the you from the past has existence is in a conversation about the you from the past. The person you are in the present is not grounded in the past. The you that you are is grounded in the conversation you are having with yourself about reality in the present. Freud, when speaking about Neurosis, said of the patient: 

Perhaps more a physics question, but there is also a philosophical question why physics validate all measurements as the same. Of course one could ask why should one particular measurement be the only 'real' one. Of course this is all about special relativity. But a bit in line of Ockhams'razor one could also suggest that the measurement with the less variable parameters should be the most right one. But if one measure the length of something with a ruler just laying it besides it, it should be a more accurate measurement of the length of something than of the measurement of a observer in motion relative to that length. But in physics both measurement are equal in validity according to SR. Only light is absolute. So the question is, isn't a measurement with less variable parameters not more accurate than one that is depending on the observers'conditions? 

Again, here you are implying something unstated. Disregarding the nagging issues of the human being and SELF in general - you are still presupposing something. If the computer is programmed to conclude that it learns by itself, then it will conclude it learns by itself, and whatever comes from that will come. However, what a computer concludes or not is irrelevant here, and furthermore does not prove that our experience of learning is just something that we concluded, and not actual learning. Now; you keep talking about our creator. But I want to know who that is. Is it intended to be God (and for that matter - is it God with a white beard and a throne)? If it is, then you might wish to enter into a debate over whether or not He is the source of us - or in what manner He is the source of us. Without that assumption distinguished, the rest of this makes no sense. Is our creator the seemingly focused - but random - process of natural selection and evolution? Our thoughts are a byproduct of that - for sure - but there is no definitive conclusion within the scientific community as to the what is at the source of consciousness, let alone where our thoughts come from. Also, given that evolution is not a thing, but a world loosely draped over millions and billions of subtle transformations; in the instance that you were referring to evolution, it is hard to pinpoint a creator at all. See, I think the real question you should be asking is, "Where does this thing I call my SELF come from? And though I know there is no one permanent thing that can be called my SELF; why do I have the overwhelming, unshakable illusion that I am a thing in a skin sack standing on a dirt ball looking through two eye-holes; and why am I at best, only capable of describing the world out there with my words? Why do I experience the limitations of my experience to be truths instead of nebulous illusions? Only after the real questions get asked can we talk about the paradoxical nature of a structure that doesn't exist, yet creates itself and believes it is the structure that it has created. 

*at this point, we're transcending things entirely and starting to talk about general facts. If we only cared about the objects in the universe, this would not be 'part of the universe' Wittgenstein also is talks a lot about hypothetical facts 

E.g. A = American Females, B = 'White', C = American Politicians An American Female is probably White, An American Politician is probably White, Therefore A Female American Politician is probably White Is obviously not necessarily true. Unless you add something like "American female politicians are probably white" 

Have a friend sit on the other side of a curtain with a box of tokens. have them pick a number of tokens (x) but not tell you how many they have picked. Ask them if they can form a rectangle with those tokens. Repeat the experiment, ensuring that at some point they choose 2 tokens 

Using mathematics a lot of 'laws' of nature are discovered, like the Higgsboson gravitational waves Diracs anti-matter etc. But if something like mathematics can predict how nature or reality 'should be' and is what does it say about the nature and reality. I sometimes think that if mathematics is usefull than the reality is perhaps symmetric and in balance or something like that. But is maths just putting a model on nature and you will find what you are looking for with the instruments and maths you use or does it really say something about nature? 

For a lot of feelings it looks clear to me that a thought preceded it. Like when I think of the possibility of war I get afraid. But imagine the case when it is very cold, is the feeling of having cold preceded by the thought that it is cold or could you feel cold without thinking about it? 

Here, the material of self is not a thread that connects now with the past. The self experiences itself in the present, and is often bound to the illusion that the self in the past exists and has substance. 

Where did you arrive at this conclusion? There is nothing at all simplistic about this philosophy. Unless of course you consider something simplistic that does not claim to know or attempt to answer all questions definitively. Consider this quote from the Absurdism Wikipedia article referencing Camus on Elusion: 

or at least took it out of context. Reading the previous sentence in the article, "The absurdist is not guided by morality, but rather, by their own integrity", should illumnate that. With that in mind, one can easily extrapolate that they recognize the validity of your question. Right and wrong are meaningless, temporal, and subjective; adding up to absurdity. However, they don't then throw the baby out with the bathwater and become nihilists; the ground of integrity is considerably more solid than morality, and gives one a stable path to walk on under all circumstances. Morality hangs witches; integrity does what this guy does. 

Descartes teached that because he thinks therefor he is. But did he tell something about the question whether there are gaps between thoughts? So probably we could not exist between those gaps? Or wasn't it possible not to think or was thinking just a quality a human posesses? 

Some people like to live in the moment, or in the now. That is possible a more psychological way of interpreting a moment. But physically seen, does this contain a time lap? So is it actually possible to live in the now? Or is the Planck time (5.39 × 10 −44 s) the time lap which defines 'now'? Or when it is 17:00 h, does that moment has a time lap? Perhaps mathematically it could have a now, because 17:00 seems to be very exact. But in practice, regarding special relativity, a clock can't indicate the time precisely 17:00 because that would also imply that there is an infinite number of decimals which due to all motions can't stay zero. Or can they? 

We also have 'Axioms' in science, like we do in mathematics. Some of these 'Basic Assumptions' are things like "There are natural causes for things that happen in the world around us", "Evidence from the natural world can be used to learn about those causes.", and "There is consistency in the causes that operate in the natural world." 

You can't really identify a logical fallacy unless someone makes a claim, and the only claim your question describes is this: 

The problem you're having with that statement is that it's ambiguous. I suggest the follow two possible interpretations of your statement, one of which is impossible, one is completely valid. I believe to understand it, you need to specify which meaning you mean. 

Dawkins presents this hypothetical argument without providing concrete examples of people actually using it. It is probably no coincidence, that even if has heard the argument used, he paraphrased it here in such a way that it is perfectly destroyed by his pre-prepared counter-argument, this is a classic straw-man. 

Hegel explains in his works how the Geist is evolving during history towards a kind of consciousfreedom. It seems to me initially that in the end our own minds has evolved to a rational God, but I'm not sure of this. But in what religion is the interpretation of a God similar to the definition of Geist according to Hegel? 

In the early days, atoms existed according to Democritos. I think Democrites just hypothesized this to build up his world view. Probably there would have been also philosophers who claimed that everything was divisible to infinity (was perhaps Aristotle such a person?) But when asking in nowadays physics it is said that elementary particles can't be divided anymore, because the just decay in certain given other particles. But is this view of nowadays physics the truth? There are muons electrons quarks and neutrino's which can't be divided anymore. But why should this be true? Why can't a particle be split into infinity? Ok, it is probably hard to do so, but is there a more profound 'law' which does state this view?
