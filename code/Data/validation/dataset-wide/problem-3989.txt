There is no reason to expect that such a thing as $dy/dz$ exists. If you rephrase everything in terms of differentials, you have $$dy=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}dx_i,\quad dz=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial R}{\partial x_i}dx_i$$ where $dx_1,\ldots,dx_n$ are linearly independent, and so you find $dy=a\, dz$ if and only if $\nabla L=a\nabla R$. But normally, the two gradient won't be parallel, so you cannot define $dy/dz$. You can do so in any given direction, though: Your fraction $(\nabla L\cdot g)/(\nabla R\cdot g)$ is a perfectly good expression for $dy/dz$ as measured in the direction given by $g$. 

No. The resulting set need not even be connected. And if it is, it need not be doubly connected, as the interior region may have boundary points in common with the original region. Aside from these crude objections, however, the answers of Mariano and Scott are OK. 

Someone should also mention Axiom, which started out as commercial package developed by IBM but after a long and tortuous journey is now open source. As I understand it, it is built on a strongly typed, mathematically oriented and user extensible type hierarchy. So it knows what groups, rings and fields are, and it lets you define your own and do computation in them. 

Pick a number $\alpha$ with $0<\alpha< n/p-1$ and a smooth, nonnegative function $g(r)$ defined for $r>0$ with $g(r)=r^{-\alpha}$ when $r$ is small, $g(r)=0$ when $r$ is large. Then $x\mapsto g(|x|)$ belongs to $W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Write $$f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty 2^{-i}g(|x-q_i|)$$ where $(q_i)$ is a dense sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The series converges in $W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and the sum is unbounded in any neighbourhood of any $q_i$, hence unbounded in any nonempty open set. Differentiability is rather hard to achieve under those circumstances. (Edit: Need $g\ge0$.) 

Your question (especially the first part) is a bit vague, but I'll shoot: A very nice example is provided by Carleson's corona theorem, stating that the unit disk is dense in the spectrum of the Hardy space $H^\infty$ (the bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disk). As for the spectra of $L^\infty$, I don't think you can ever come up with a concrete example of a character on this space. You actually need the axiom of choice to prove that the spectrum is nonempty. Likewise with the points of the spectrum of $H^\infty$ outside the unit disk. 

If you differentiate the ODE one or more times with respect to time or the initial conditions you will find an ODE for the derivatives of the solution. Use standard existence theory to prove the new ODEs have a solution, then verify that these really are the derivatives of the original equation. (Sorry to be so brief and sketchy – I am a bit pressed for time this morning.) 

The result is false if $D$ is not closed: take a boundary point $a\not\in D$ and let $f(x)=|x-a|$ and $g(x)=1+f(x)$. If $D$ is closed, it is true. There is some $R>0$ so that $\tfrac12 f(x) < g(x) < 2f(x)$ whenever $|x| > R$. On the other hand, on the compact set $\{x\in D\colon |x|\le R\}$ there are bounds $0 < m \le f(x) \le M$ and $0 < m \le g(x) \le M$. The result $f(x)\asymp g(x)$ follows immediately. 

I am going to stick with the standard terminology $H^m$ here. Taking Fourier transforms one finds that $$\langle u,v\rangle_m=\int\hat u(\xi)\bar{\hat v}(\xi)(1+|\xi|^2)^m\,d\xi$$ (give or take the odd multiplicative constant), where $H^m$ consists precisely of those $u\in L^2$ for which $\langle u,u\rangle<\infty$. This works even for $m<0$, if you allow distributions whose Fourier transforms are functions. Everything follows from this, including the fact that $H^{-m}$ acts as the dual of $H^m$ simply by the distribution $u$ acting on the function $v$, which corresponds to the integral $$\langle u,v\rangle=\int \hat u(\xi)\bar{\hat v}(\xi)\,d\xi=\int \hat u(\xi)(1+|\xi|^2)^{-m/2}\cdot\hat{\bar v}(\xi)(1+|\xi|^2)^{m/2}\,d\xi$$ where I have split up the integrand into a product of two $L^2$ functions. For this reason, it seems more natural to identify $H^{-m}$ with the dual of $H^m$ than to identify $H^m$ with its own dual. However, you can go ahead and identify any Sobolev space with the dual of any other just by inserting a suitable power of $1+|\xi|^2$ in the integral defining the pairing between the two. Rather than coming straight out and answering your question, I'll leave it to you to ponder the consequences of the above. In particular, note that you we embed and identify you have to keep careful track of what space you have identified with whose dual, or you will be endlessly befuddled. Addendum: To spell out a more direct answer to your question, $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_m$ can identify $H^{m+\sigma}$ with the dual of $H^{m-\sigma}$, since we can write $$\langle u,v\rangle_m=\int \hat u(\xi)(1+|\xi|^2)^{(m-\sigma)/2}\cdot\bar{\hat v}(\xi)(1+|\xi|^2)^{(m+\sigma)/2}\,d\xi$$ where I have split the integrand into a product of two $L^2$ functions. Edit: Changed a couple $\hat{\bar v}$ into $\bar{\hat v}$. 

Taking Fourier transforms, you get the action by multiplication. (Really, $x$ acts by multiplying with $e^{ix}$.) The closed invariant subspaces will thus be of the form $\{f\in L^2(\mathbb{R})\colon\hat f|_E=0\}$ for measurable sets $E$. But you were asking for closed irreducible subspaces: There aren't any, because the Lebesgue measure has no atoms. 

I think it's darned near impossible, unless you are actually going to use the definition in a proof of some non-obvious fact. A semi-obvious fact, such as the intermediate value theorem, won't quite do, for you now face the problem of explaining why this requires a proof at all. (Given a notion of continuity as “the function graph is connected”, it is not at all clear that this theorem is not obvious.) Sorry to be such a downer – but you say it's a course on proofs, so maybe it's not so bad after all. I mean, it should be clear that the very idea of a proof requires definitions to work with? So you can tell them that if the need for this definition is not clear at present, it will become clear once you start trying to prove stuff. Mike's answer is of course excellent, if you can dig up the actual mistake Cauchy made and if it isn't going to be too advanced. All sorts of pathological examples, like space filling curves or functions that are everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable, are good to drive home the point, but again there is a risk they might be too demanding. 

Well, there is a way, but I don't know if I like it: Let $V$ be a complex inner product space, and for any $f\in V^*$ and $\epsilon>0$ let $$V^f(\epsilon)=\{v\in V:\|v\|=\|f\|, f(v)\ge\|f\|^2(1-\epsilon)\}$$ Now, as $\epsilon\to0$ we expect the functionals induced by $v\in V^f(\epsilon)$ to converge to $f$. More precisely, let $\bar v$ be the functional $\bar v(u)=\langle u,v\rangle$. It's easy to estimate $|f(u)-\bar v(u)|$ when $u$ is parallel to $v$. It's just a tiny bit harder to do so when $u\perp v$: Assume first that $\|u\|=\|v\|=\|f\|$ and consider $f(\overline{f(u)}u+\overline{f(v)}v)$, compute the norm using Pythagoras and employ the definition of $\|f\|$ to find $$\|f(u)\|^2\le\|f\|^4-|f(v)|^2\le\|f\|^4(2\epsilon-\epsilon^2)=\|f\|^2\|u\|^2(2\epsilon-\epsilon^2)$$ I left out some details, but the end result is that $\|\bar v-f\|\to0$ when $v\in V^f(\epsilon)$ and $\epsilon\to0$. Now we can finally define the inner product on $H^*$ by $$\langle f,g\rangle=\lim\langle w,v\rangle$$ where $v\in V^f(\epsilon)$, $w\in V^g(\epsilon)$ and $\epsilon\to0$. Pretty? I don't think so, but it seems to answer your question. As a bonus, the Riesz representation theorem is now of course just around the corner. 

Consider the running time for adding a new element to a sorted list, keeping the list sorted. If the list is an array, you can find the insertion point in $O(\log n)$ steps, where $n$ is the current size of the list. But then you have to make room for the new element by shifting all the elements behind it one step back, and that takes $n/2$ steps on the average. Or you could use a linked list, but then binary search is not available, and it takes $n/2$ steps (on the average) to find the insertion point (and $O(1)$ to do the actual insertion). For a properly implemented priority queue, insertion is $O(\log n)$, and so is fixing up the queue after removing the smallest member.

Better communications must surely play a role. Travel is easier, faster and more convenient, and telecommunications helps to – not least the Internet, of course. Even today, I have the distinct impression that collaboration within a single department is relatively rare. Certainly most if not all of the long running productive collaborations I know of involve mathematicians in different countries, often on different continents.

The solution space of a homogeneous (ordinary or partial) linear differerential equation has no natural basis. 

No. Let X={1,2,3} and Y={1,2}. Let f map 1 to 1, 2 and 3 to 2. Let the topology on X be {∅,{2},{1,2},{2,3},{1,2,3}} and that on Y be {∅,{2},{1,2}}. f maps the closed set {3} onto the non-closed set {2}. 

Spin(3) comes into the play only as the covering space of SO(3), I think. You do everything in SO(3). Draw a curve through your body from a stationary point, like your foot, up the leg and torso and out the arm, ending at the dish. Each point along the curve traces out a curve in SO(3), thus defining a homotopy. After you have completed the trick and ended back in the original position, you now have a homotopy from the double rotation of the dish with a constant curve at the identity of SO(3). You can't stop at the halfway point, lock the dish and hand in place, now at the original position, and untwist your arm: This reflects the fact that the single loop in SO(3) is not null homotopic. 

See the answer of L Spice for the principal value bit. For the second bit, the formula from the second paper is rather suspect. For example, $a=1/2$ produces the divergent sum (even in the principal value sense) $$\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{z-n}.$$ And for your case $a=0$, $z=1/2$ yields $\sum(z-n)^{-1}=0$ by symmetry, so the formula cannot be right then either. 

(i) Not if I understood you correctly. A Hilbert space is so very symmetric that given that orthogonality is necessary but not sufficient for independence, there isn't anything else to look for. To be precise, any set of orthogonal vectors can be carried onto any other set of orthogonal vectors of the same cardinality by a unitary transformation. (Well, to be honest the dimensions of the orthogonal complement must match too, but that doesn't help.) (ii) If you mean geometric as seen in the Hilbert space you talk about, no, since the answer to (i) is no. I can't rule out the possibility that you might turn these “no” answers to “yes” answers by adding a suffictient amount of structure to the space, but I don't think that is what you were asking? 

I have come across the notion of regions with Lipschitz boundaries in a number of papers on boundary value problems for PDEs. But every such paper seems to take the notion of Lipschitz-ness for granted. (*) If $S$ is Lipschitz(1), then after a rotation of the axes, it locally looks like the graph of a Lipschitz function $\gamma\colon\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\to\mathbb{R}$. Put $\psi(x,t)=(x,\gamma(x)-t)$ to obtain the Lipschitz(2) property. 

No. The minimum as always smaller than or equal to the arithmetic mean, and is strictly smaller with positive probability (i.e., when not all the $X_i$ have the same value). Hence its expected value is strictly smaller than that of the mean. 

I am going to throw caution to the wind and suggest an Answer, based on the previous comments: No, there is no useful characterization of the regions you seek, other than the requirement stated. On the one hand, there is the region $\{(x,y):0\lt x\lt 1, -2\lt y\lt \sin x^{-1}\}$, and on the other, you can make part of the boundary an Osgood curve, by which I mean a Jordan arc of positive area. (See, e.g., W. F. Osgood, A Jordan curve of positive area. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 4 (1903) 107–112). Between these two examples, I think you'll be hard pressed to find an easily checkable local condition on the boundary that will guarantee the “Jordan-ness” of the boundary curve. 

Edit: A closer look reveals that the proof in the reference below is not the diagonal proof. I am leaving the answer up since the reference might be of interest anyhow. Cantor had a paper in Crelle's Journal 77 (1874) 258–262. In Christopher P. Grant's translation, the title of the paper is On a Property of the Class of all Real Algebraic Numbers. In §2, we can read 

In general, no. For the double integral $\iint_T f(x,y)\,dx\,dy$ will be the height on any side, as is seen by turning the triangle with one side parallel to an axis and performing the integral. So at least, $T$ has to be equilateral. I don't know the answer in that case. Edit: Wait, wait – the same trick works even if I turn the triangle at any angle, hence all heights (defined as $\sup_{RT} y-\inf_{RT} y$ where $R$ is a rotation) must be the same. That is never true for a triangle, and limits the number of convex sets seriously – but there are still non-circles that might satisfy the criterion. Once more, I don't know the answer, but for circles at least, it should in principle be straightforward to check if a radially symmetric function will do. And of course, if there is a solution, there is a radially symmetric one, as can be seen by rotating the solution and taking the average of all its rotated variants. Edit2: For the unit disk (and radially symmetric $f$) the answer should in principle be obtainable by the Abel transform (which is really nothing but the Radon transform on radially symmetric functions). The required Abel transform $\Phi$ should be the characteristic function of the interval $[0,1]$ (we only use positive $x$ due to symmetry), and the inverse Abel transform provides the answer: $$f(r)=\frac{-1}{\pi}\int_r^\infty \frac{\Phi'(x)\,dx}{\sqrt{x^2-r^2}}=\frac{1}{\pi\sqrt{1-r^2}}$$ when $0\le r<1$. Being lazy, I checked the answer using Maple, and it seems right. Addendum: Anton Petrunin pointed out in a comment that the above measure is the push-forward of the surface measure on the unit sphere on the unit disk under projection. It is well-known that the surface area of the portion of a disk between two parallel planes depends only on the distance between the planes (and is proportional to said distance), which ties in nicely with the desired property of $f$ on the disk.
