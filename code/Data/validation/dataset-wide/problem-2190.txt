As always, when someone asks you to do something, and you don't understand, you talk. In this case you talk with your supervisor and indicate that you don't understand the task. If you find that it's the task orders you don't understand, you ask the supervisor questions until you understand what is being asked of you. If you find that you understand the orders, but you don't have the ability/understanding to complete the task itself, then you tell the supervisor that you don't have the knowledge to complete the task. You may be able to find time to learn how before the task must be completed. Or you may be able to work with someone else who can help enough to make up for your lack of knowledge. Or the task may need to be assigned elsewhere. 

My guess is that this was the whole point of the question. Some employers want people who care about their job, the company, their surroundings, and who would do good things that aren't technically their job. Some companies want their employees to have initiative. Some companies don't really care as long as you do what you are told. You felt that picking up trash was beneath you. And you also conveyed that you wouldn't take the initiative to do things (anything?) on your own, but would do what you were explicitly told to do. For some employers, that would be fine - for others, not so much. If you felt strongly about it, then perhaps this wouldn't be a good job for you anyway. 

If you are convinced that your coworker has faked a resume, you could go to your boss with your accusation. However, it appears that the only "evidence" you have is that your coworker claims many years of experience but asks rather basic questions. By itself, that proves nothing. Accusing someone of something as unprofessional as this shouldn't be taken lightly. You are putting your own reputation in jeopardy here. What if you are wrong? Have you see this person's resume? Did you interview him? Do you actually know what this person claimed during the interview? Did you check his references? Do you realize that your inability to find an online resume, LinkedIn account, or Facebook account means absolutely nothing? Think this over very carefully before you do anything. If you still decide you are right, and still decide you should rat out your coworker, then just approach your boss with your feelings. Be prepared for your boss to disapprove of your actions - in my experience bosses don't like to see this sort of thing happen on their team. If it were me, I'd be solely concerned about if the person is capable of doing the job or not, and dealing with that. What your coworker did or didn't do regarding his resume isn't your business, nor is it your problem. And I wouldn't ever accuse someone of anything unless I was absolutely sure. Your mileage may vary. 

It's hard to tell what you are planning to say to your employer. If you intend to tell them that you will be going to school full time, then you don't need to embellish on that. But if your reason for leaving is to deal with health issues, then it makes sense to talk about that. You can also tell them that you hope to be better in the future and be able to work in another role. In general you don't ever need to provide a reason for leaving, just a date. But in some contexts you will be viewed as odd or flighty, and your ability to find new employment at this company would be diminished. 

A quick phone call should resolve this quickly. Call whoever made the offer. Say something along the lines of: "I just received the offer letter. Thank you so much! But I am a bit confused about the attached job description. Is this the formal job description for the position I'd be filling?" Then, you may have to go into a bit of detail about what confuses you. It may very well be a mistake in the attachment. Or it may be a mistake in understanding. Either way, the solution in situations like this is simple - talk with the person who can clear things up for you. 

While it would be nice if interviewing companies provided timely feedback, many do not. And one week is certainly not unusual. It would make sense to get in touch with the hiring manager and reaffirm your interest in the position (if you are indeed still interested). And it's also reasonable to ask what is the next step, and when you might expect to hear back from them - those are two things I always ask at the end of an interview. 

You probably can't. Some might ask "Why not?" The reason is (at least in my over 36 years of experience), rejecting an offer you already accepted will almost certainly lead to hard feelings and probably blacklisting from the company you are rejecting. Your best bet is to discuss what happened with the new employer. Be honest and open about how you felt when you accepted their offer, why you wanted to leave your current employer, and what happened to change your mind and then reject their offer. The new employer may understand and not have any hard feelings, or they may still end up with hard feelings. Either way, when you say "politely and professionally" I think you are on the right track. You want them, your current employer, and others to remember you as a polite, professional person, even if they aren't happy with your new situation. Meanwhile, what did your current employer counter-offer with that caused you to change your mind like this? I have found that people generally have several good reasons when they conclude that they should leave a company. Usually a counter-offer is "more money" and covers only one of the real reasons. In my experience, such folks leave soon anyway. I'd be curious to hear more about the specifics of your situation. 

You should just have a friendly chat with your direct supervisor. One phrase that has stood me well over the years - Assume positive intent. Rather than assuming you are being singled out, or going in with an attitude of "gender bias", just assume there was an innocent reason for your being left out of a cubical until you know for sure that harm was intended. 

If you actually do get an offer, you will need to immediately explain that you were hoping to have your current role filled so that you could join in January, but that it hasn't worked out. You will need to apologize, and ask if it is possible to delay your arrival until June. Expect the answer to be "No". Most companies hire for positions of immediate need, not 6 months out. But you'll only know for sure if you ask. 

Everyone can give estimates, although many would prefer not to do so. I suspect you would be better off indicating that you don't feel confident giving estimates, and asking how you might learn to get better at it. 

No. Your personal financial goals are of utmost important to you, but of little interest to your employer. In general, your employer wants you to be "happy enough" with your job and with your compensation. Employers generally work hard to determine what a competitive offer for a given position in a given locale must be, and they factor that into their offer. That way, they are in a position to attract and retain the kind of workforce they seek. While it's possible you might get more solely because you have decided that you "need more", it's rather unlikely that an employer would stray far from its hiring and salary guidelines based on the particular needs of an individual. Unless you have a unique talent or are in a strong buyers' market for individuals, you are not likely to get more due to your financial goals. It puts you in an awkward position to even bring it up. A few other things to consider... If you bring your personal financial goals up, you start down the path of making yourself seem "high maintenance". Employers don't want to have to worry about their employees' financial difficulties. What if your financial goals change later - will you demand more (or perhaps accept less)? If you were to go the route of asking for more because you just don't see how you'll "ever be able to afford to buy a house with a salary of $X." you immediately open yourself up to a response indicating all the people who are happy living in apartments, or who have indeed managed to purchase a home (although perhaps not the kind of home you have in mind). Or you might be drawn into a discussion about how someone your age should wait before buying a house anyway. That's not a discussion worth pursuing with a potential employer. If employers adjusted salary offers based on individual financial goals, would you be willing to accept less because you live in a less expensive part of town than some others? Or would you accept less because you don't have any children while Bob has seven and has a personal goal of sending them all to expensive boarding schools? What about Nick who has a personal financial goal of purchasing huge tracts of land? Or would you accept less than me because my personal financial goal is to retire at 45? If you are the employer, should you now only consider potential employees who already have a house? If you were rejected by such an employer solely because you don't already have a house, would that be okay? 

Be prepared when the inevitable questions come about why you want to leave after less than 3 months. First, get completely clear in your own head why you actually want to leave and specifically what you are looking for in your next position. In your question, you said "I thought I wanted to get into software development, but I find now that I'd much rather deal with the systems behind it ", and later you said "While I would enjoy development, I'm really just not liking the work this company does". If you said that during an interview, I'd be confused. Do you not like software development? Or do you not like your current company? Confusing the interviewer is generally a bad thing. If you say "you dislike their style", then you need to be very, very clear as to what you dislike about it and why, and you need to be able to say what you would like. Make sure that your preferred "style" matches what your potential new company actually does, in order to avoid another short-term job. You also want to avoid coming across as "high maintenance" - someone who needs things exactly his/her way or you quit. It's okay to have made a decision that didn't work out as hoped. Show your next interviewer what you have learned from that decision, and how you will be sure that your next job will last longer. 

Your experience as a freelancer should be part of your resume. Depending on how many projects you participated in, can help determine if you list them all, or just summarize the overall experience. For example, if you have a handful of significant projects lasting more than a month each, it would make sense to list them individually, and describe the project and your work. On the other hand if you have dozens of short-term projects each lasting just a few week, then create one entry summarizing them all. In addition you should refer to your freelance experience in your cover letter, and show how that experience applies directly to the full-time job you are applying for. This is the vehicle where you can highlight the kinds of terrific feedback you earned on UpWork. Be prepared to discuss your experiences during the interviews, and be prepared to indicate how you think your freelance work will be different from the full-time work in the job for which you are applying. Be aware that some hiring managers won't apply the same weight to freelance (particularly, at-home freelance) work, as they would to on-site, full-time work. 

The only way you can accurately evaluate an offer is by understanding all details of the offer - including benefits. You should also understand more about the company (such as the size). Ask for some time to discuss these details before you make you decision. If necessary, write a list for yourself so you don't forget to ask something important again. Know what you are really getting into before you say yes or no. 

I don't believe offering suggestions on a job advertisement is considered conducting "work for another company". I assume you wouldn't be paid for your efforts. I also don't think your current company would care if you offered these suggestions and I don't see that it would make you look bad in any way. If anything, it makes you look helpful. But if you are concerned here, then simply ask your new manager if it's okay. I've often stayed in contact with good former managers and helped them in many ways similar to what you are suggesting. Still do. It was never a problem. 

It's not taboo, it's just a waste of time. If the employer is knowingly underpaying, saying "Hey, you are underpaying" is not at all likely to make any difference. Worse, it could start a series of bad feelings on both sides. If you are attempting to negotiate a raise, avoid the "you are below market" argument, since they already know this. Instead, focus on what you individually are worth to the company. Try to find a way that they can be below market for everyone except you. If you feel that the payscale at this company outweighs the other benefits, it might be time to seek employment elsewhere. Perhaps you can find a company that isn't known to underpay, or even one that overpays. 

Not much. Instead, send an email asking for a small bit of his time privately at his earliest convenience. Make a special trip into the office if necessary or go in early/stay late if needed, and discuss your resignation in person. It's a bit more awkward resigning face-to-face, particularly if you haven't experienced resigning before. But, as with most things, it gets easier the more you do it. 

I have never heard of such a policy. In fact, virtually every place I have ever worked had some form of "test" during every interview. I can't explain the exact reason your HR has such a policy - for that you need to ask them. I'm sure they have a reason behind it, although it may not be a reason with which you agree. If I had to guess, they are worried that your "testing" isn't applied equally to all candidates, and/or might be biased toward one group over another, increasing the risk of a discrimination lawsuit. This is something that is hard to realize when you are doing it. You might think your "tests" are objective, but HR might think that are not. HR might be trying to avoid a problem, and perhaps going overboard. Your HR rep might advise you that asking for coding examples would be appropriate if and only if that coding is specifically the kind used in the job at hand. Or, HR might be just trying to avoid coding tests that aren't relevant to the job. One of HR's roles is to avoid lawsuits resulting from interviews. If you are in the US, I'm sure during your training, you were told not to ask people if they were married, how old they are, or anything that might lead to a discrimination suit. That's HR's influence. In our litigious society, it's difficult to interview and avoid "risky" questions, but it's important to try hard. The fact that you are actually being trained on how to conduct interviews is a factor that could be used in your defense of a lawsuit. Try to see this from HR's point of view, and ask them about the thinking behind their suggestions.
