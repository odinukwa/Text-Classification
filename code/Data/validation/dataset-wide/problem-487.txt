I remember I saw somewhere new Sram system that does not require chainguide. Don't remember the model, but could you please tell me more about it? How does it work? 

I have a old trusty pump that over the years has the presta head filled with tubeles goo. Noways it pumps the tires very slow. Is there any chemical way to remove it without melting the plastic? 

The short answer: You will probably fall on your back, so it's not a good idea to try doing this on high speed fackies. The long answer: As answered before me, you stop. That's why most of BMX freecoasters have quite big angle of free crank turn (and it's even adjustiable in some models, like the KHE feecoaster), so when you land in fackie (for example from 180 from stairs) even if you go a bit forwards on the pedals (and it's quite reasonable you'll do it), you still be able to roll back. Otherwise you would be flying on your back (same thing like when you lock your front brake). Note, this way you can't do lots of tricks that are meant to do with tailtap (360 with taps, brakeless tailtap and so on). 

My older MTB that I ride to work on, has hydraulic disk Deore in front and Tektro V-Brakes for the rear, and it's totally OK. Anyway, your brain will have no issues to adapt to such negliable changes, like the power you need to apply with each hand. After a few rides you'll be OK. 

As people already mentioned in the comments, it's old good Kona Stinky. For me this is a symbolic bike, Paul Bassagotia, one of the pioneers of the freeride scene, used to ride on it before moving to Scott. You can find more detail on specs it had here: $URL$ And here we can see Kona's older catalogue, including older Stinkies $URL$ 

I have Shimano XT 11 speed compatible rear wheel (on Novatec hubs, the ones that came with Kona Process 134 DL 2016). Can I use Shimano 10 speed MTB system on this hub? 

My friends convinced me to try clipless pedals, that I never trusted too much (BMX background). Now while I'm getting used to them and experience very funny falls, I try to figure out, can a used-to-cleats rider drop his foot in a sandy corner, or the only thing he can do is to get used to proper race style cornering? 

If the pebble was sharp, it definitely could be the reason. Each time before you change the tube, check the tire from the inside for any thorns that stuck or (something that happens quite often) glass particles that left inside. Using sealant tubes could be another great idea if your main riding is off road (I think that without them I would be changing tubes two times a ride). 

I would like to summarize all the common wisdom that was mentioned here. Note I'm talking about MTB enduro/all mountain/aggressive trail riding that involve hammering down downhill style trails, with roots, stones, drops above meter height. Also I assume your frame does not have any bottle cage mount, which is common among modern enduro bikes (Nukeproof Mega, YT Capra, Polygon Square One) 

It mostly depends on your riding style. If you ride neat asphalt all the time there is no reason for it, on the other hand it helps to maintain control off the road, so the front wheel will stay in contact with the ground and helps to save your joints from the vibrations. IMO in your specific case, it's better to save your wrists and get a short 80mm suspension fork with locking, so you could lock it on asphalt and open on gravel/off-road. Just remember to unlock it off-road, else you'll ruin it. 

I remember I had ~ 2 inch tear on my Kenda K-Rad. I glued it from the inside with a rubber adapter from a light reflector and it did a good job for another half a year. It's totally not the end of the world and in the worst case scenario you will simply stuck with flat (your tube will escape from the tear and pop like a baloon). 

I can't decide between these two models. I need them mostly for technical trail riding, like getting on boulders on the way up (I'm fine with cleats going down, but on the way up on each mistake I have to find my way to unclip to put a feet, and 50% of the time I don't quite succeed in that and lay sideways). Does the new VXi bald sole design sacrifices some of the grip in exchange for the ability to reposition the foot? What would be your choice? 

Most of BMXers I know put wide tire in front and narrower one for the rear (2.35 vs 2.10, sometimes rear have slicker protector). However some use the same for front and rear, I remember Cory Martinez has same. I myself have Animal Tom White 2.0 in rear and Animal GLH 2.35 in front. 

I don't care to maintain my bike a bit more, considering that bushings cost less then bearings. But I know that changing bearings in the rear linkage requires a set of tools (presses for each bearing diameter), that's it's among the small number of repairs I don't do it myself. Is it the same with bushings, or maybe they require a cheaper generic tool, so I could invest a few bucks and replace them myself? 

Get Odyssey cable & lever. It did magic to my BB5 5 years ago. This fork doesn't looks like it has brake mounts, so either get another fork or another (sick maybe) idea is to get actualy two bikes: MTB for offroad, 20 BMX for park and street. That's what I did eventualy. 

I tend to agree with @amcnabb, softer rubber will stick to asphalt better, but it's going to collect lots of junk. However soft tires will also live less than harder slicks, so anyway it's the balance between grip and durability. If you are not that worried about gripping the road in crazy turns, just search for harder rubber slicks. 

I've been riding with a bottle filled with isotonic drink + hydration backpack with plain water for quite awhile. Recently my bottle stated to fall off on descents (not the best frame design + increase in speed). I'm looking for alternatives to frame mounted bottle cage that will suit aggressive trail riding. Solutions like Source dual bladder won't fit, because once you had a sweetened drink in your bladder it's just a matter of time before mold starts to grow there. I've looked on runners belts, but 600ml is way too little for hot conditions. Assuming I want to separate between sweetened electrolyte drink and regular water, and a minimum of 1l liquids all together, what are my options on the market nowadays? 

As we know, changing the fork length will change bike geometry a bit. For example, increasing fork travel by 10 cm will make the headangle slacker and raise the bottom bracket. I consider to increase fork travel on my bike by 20 mm, and to fix the increase in bb height with some headangle changing headset (like Cane Creek angleset). While I don't mind my bike to be slacker (actualy it's one of the goals of this modification), I do want my BB stay on the same height. Is there any formula we can develop to understand how would a change in fork length influences the headangle, and how the headangle influences the BB height? 

I've had my Tifosi sport glasses with photochromic lenses for about 4 years. Lately, when I rode them in 10 am morning sun, my eyebrow and eye started to feel terrible pain, that passed once I removed my sunglasses. A friend of mine, that works in a bike shop said that polycarbonate lenses have a life span of about 3 years. I've bought a new pair of glasses, but now I'm trying to decide what to do with the old pair. So the question, do polycarbonate lenses really degrade with wear, time and when wiping them?
