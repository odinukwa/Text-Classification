This question is not the same as the 36 gear post which used a combination of internal hub gears, cogs, and chainrings. This one is much simpler and much lower cost. Part of the problem of something like a 1x15 (which doesn't exist) is chain misalignment. However what about something like this to get 15 progressive gears with good chain alignment? You have 5 cogs in the back, spanning a 1.75:1 range (28, 24, 21, 18, 16 for example). However, instead of the typical triple front, have the fronts so they are 2x of the next smaller chainring. For example, imagine something like 14, 28, and 56 front. This would be most practical on something like a roadbike. The 3 front chainrings would be aligned with the innermost, the middle, and the outmost cog. Crosschaining would be moderate at most so nothing to worry about. The idea here is you can start with the granny chainring, shift all 5 cogs, then go to the middle chainring and repeat all 5 cogs, then shift to largest chainring and shift all 5 cogs again. That would give you 15 progressive gears without having to do any fancy interleaved shifting. There is no way to get duplicate gear ratios here and the change between adjacent gear ratios is a reasonable 15%. The range (spread) between lowest and highest gear would be 7 which is quite generous (lowest is 14/28 = 0.5 and highest is 56/16 = 3.5). If someone wanted this biased more towards taller gearing that could easily be done. So my question is why don't we see gearing like this on bikes when it makes good sense? Even a child can grasp the simple concept of shifting thru all 5 cogs then go to the next larger chainring and repeat. This concept can be tweaked to 3x4 for someone who wants wider gaps between gears and fewer gear ratios and to 3x6 for someone who wants narrower gear spacing and more gears (18 vs 15 vs 12 gears total). If a 56 tooth front chainring is too large, we can go with 13, 26, and 52 instead and adjust the rear cogs to 26, 23, 20, 17, 15. I think it would be fun to make a bike like this but I think the problem is the FD wont be able to handle that much difference in tooth ranges but if that is the only limiting factor, then perhaps a 2x5 or even a 2x6 with this same concept. That would have a spread of about 4 which is good enough for a roadbike. I actually checked this technique with my bike and if I change my granny chainring to 22 and keep my 42 large, it will work fine cuz when I shift from small/small, I don't then go to large/large cuz of the MegaRange gear I may eventually have. I am actually temped to try it. It would give me 13 progressive gears which beats a 1x11 in several ways. 1x11 has its advantages but well chosen sprockets in a 2x7 setup can beat it in other ways. Changing my $100 bike to a 2x7 is much more cost effective than going to a 1x11 and I will have more range too. Actually there is $0 cost if I just shift over the middle chainring (skipping it entirely but just using it as a "ramp" between the smallest and largest chainrings. 

Does anyone yet make an affordable quad chainring? I would love to see a 4x12 with my staggered cog idea such that all 12 gears are shifted progressively using the 4 chainrings. Each chainring would engage only 3 cogs. I think the "double shifting" would be quite easy. On the gear indicator (1 thru 12), every 3rd gear could be marked with a different color number to indicate to the rider that a "double" shift is required next. Generally when the rider settles into a good pace on reasonably flat pavement, he/she will only be using 1 chainring and using the 3 gears for it to fine tune the cadence. For example, if the chainrings are labelled A,B,C and D and each cog for each of those chainrings is labeled 1 thru 3, someone might be using C2 gear but shift to C1 for a slight headwind and C3 for a slight tailwind. I think it is a good and interesting idea and would look cool too. I played around in a spreadsheet and came up with these ratios: 

Is there a linear relationship between gearing and crank arm length? For example, on my multispeed bike, my favorite gearing is 34/20 which is 1.7 and with 26" tires, that is 44.2 gear inches but I have 170mm crank arms. For my wife to be, I want a similar "feel" (pedal effort) but her bike has 24" diameter tires and 140mm crank arms. So does that mean instead of shooting for 44.2 gear inches, I should also compensate for the shorter crank arms and instead go for (140/170) * 44.2 gear inches = 36.4 gear inches? If so, since they are 24" tires, I will need about a 1.5 gearing so something like 34/22 or 32/22 sprocket combination should be just about right. Additional information (although not sure if relevant here) is I am 5' 9" tall and she is 4' 11" tall. With her shorter, weaker legs, I am thinking a little extra compensation is in order. The "shortest" gearing I can go with (using sprockets I already have), are 28/22 which is 1.27 which will be 30.5 gear inches. 

Would it be a good idea to have a flywheel on a bicycle to help smooth out the "dead zones" when pedaling, kinda like those oval sprockets were designed to do? Perhaps some design that can let the user try different weights and select the best one for them? This could be used on bikes that are not being raced but rather on those where smoothness is desired. The flywheel could be designed to work well with a moderate cadence such as between 60 and 90. For a simple flywheel, they could attach something to the front chainring to give it more weight. Perhaps a poor mans flywheel would be to attach magnets to the outside of the largest chainring just inside of the teeth so no contact with the chain. As a side advantage, when going up a hill with a flat approach area, you can build up a high cadence and thus store up a little more energy. The total added weight should be no more than 1 pound. Actually I think just installing heavy tubes should have a similar flywheel effect and I already purchased one of those. A bike is different than a car since a bike has high torque but low horsepower so the flywheel design would have to account for that. 

Has anyone ever tried just using a cheap ($5 for example) bike computer but instead of using the wheels, placing the magnet on the crank arms and then calibrating it to show cadence instead of road speed? I may try this but the computer I use only allows a 1 to 3 mm gap at most and that may be difficult to get down there. 

I think it is a good idea since it gives the rider a choice between close ratio and skipping gears. Perhaps a special shifter that has 2 rings, one shifts every gear and the other shifts to every other gear (such as cogs 1,3,5,7...). Then the rider can start in a desired low gear and perhaps quickly go up thru the gears 2 at a time until the midrange gears at which point there will be some fine tuning based on load (wind, slight hill...) so then use the close ratio gears of about 5.9% spacing. A more practical setup might be a 2x7 using chainrings and cogs but with a doubler/halver gear either in the rear hub or BB. That would be 28 progressive gears but can be shifted in 2s (like a progressive 14 speed). 

To me, the left side on a bike that doesn't have a rear disc brake is being somewhat wasted. So how about this idea... on the right side have the normal gears but on the left side, have a freewheeling granny gear. So you would have 2 chains but also some type of clutch so you could switch between the granny gear and the normal gears. The granny gear could be something incredibly low such as 20/50 but the smallest cog on the main gearset could be much more reasonable such as 34 or even 28. This would help alleviate the big jump of 10 or more teeth on the granny cog found in MegaRange type gearsets. By isolating the granny gear, the cassette tooth jumps (between gears) can be made more reasonable. Perhaps they could even integrate a disc brake and the granny sprocket in one, with the caliper being positioned in the opening where there is no chain. Perhaps run a concentric ring close to the teeth to hold out any grease from hitting the brake pads. That would be something to behold. Actually, the granny gear can be enabled all the time since the road speed would almost always exceed that of the granny gear so the pawls on it would not engage. The lowest normal gear would always be faster than the granny gear, just like if in a gear you pedal at half the speed required to maintain road speed, the gear will not engage the pawls. When the rider wanted to actually use the granny gear, he/she would have to disable the main gears (via some type of clutch), then pedal fast enough to engage the granny pawls. So maybe when anticipating a large hill, one could clutch out of the main gears, coast down to walking speed, pedal fast (about 100 RPMs), and then the granny gear would engage. 20/50 (0.4) would be a hell of a hill climbing gear. With 26" tires, that would be 10.4 gear inches. Wow! Also if you were really slick, you could make the granny gear so that the chain is the same length as the main chain so if perhaps your main chain breaks, you have a backup with you. There are some combinations of sprockets that would make the chain lengths the same (or at least very close). Also if you rarely use the granny gear, you could half wear out the main chain and then swap them so you get better performance on the main chain and longer gear life. I know if I had a 20/50 (0.4) low gear I would use it a lot. That would be awesome. So the question is can this be made to work and if so, has anyone tried it yet?
