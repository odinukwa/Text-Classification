I'm not familiar with the arguments here, but it seems there would be an issue with measurement. To carry out any sort of "materialist-physicalist" interpretation entails, by definition, some way of defining and measuring "things." At least the possibility. What would this "atomic" level of qualia be? We can label color swatches and match them to spectra. But this does not capture the "sensation" of red, which must finally rely on self-reporting. So if qualia are admitted, it may just be that they can never fit into the models that define some sort of "physicalist" interpretation. It's self-reporters all the way down. Not an ontological but a methodological dualism, which one might argue amounts to the same. 

Keynes once quipped that public figures who think they are expressing their original thoughts are usually echoing the words of some dead economist. The same might be said of the dead Kant in respect to science. While his thought provides a comprehensive modern framework for science, most practicing scientists have never read him and large swaths of the philosophy of science ignore or reject what they take to be muddled Kantianism. Bertrand Russell and E.G. Moore were especially hostile to Kant, convicting him of logical errors and supposing that transcendental idealism rested on a mistaken faith in the inviolability of Euclidean Geometry, which Kant presented as the very model of the "synthetic a priori." These dubious charges stuck all the way through logical positivism and continue in the analytic tradition. Certainly Popper's demarcation criteria seem to reject Kantian approaches, or at least so Popper claimed. Today, however, it seems that more philosophers of science may be open to Kant. Henry Allison offers detailed refutations of the above calumnies, and Kuhn was explicitly influenced by Kant in his anti-Popperian demarcation by "paradigms." He claimed that reading Kant while studying physics utterly altered his naive realism, though those are not his words. As to the bigger picture. Bacon first described the emerging rift between the rationalists, "the spiders," who weave webs of theory (coherence theory, we might say) and the new empirical naturalists, "the busy ants," who gather bits of data (correspondence theory, roughly). The rift grew into Leibnizian mathematical rationalism and Humean skepticism. It was Kant's great project to merge and mutually limit the two on a firm metaphysical basis, in part to secure the basis of Newtonian physics. His unique amalgam of coherence and correspondence theory is in many ways, and intentionally, a kind of philosophical version of the hypothetic-deductive framework of science, an expansion of knowledge by rational (conceptual) methods and experimental (intuitional) confirmation. And indeed science does undertake continuous active synthesis based on a priori assumptions of necessity and universality. Even the "experiment" is somewhat Kantian, in that it is hardly passive reception of sense data... the experiential confirmation in "common sense" is quite artificial and actively constructed. Most working scientists tend to believe they are following analytical rules and discovering "correspondences" with hard "reality." So they look askance at Kantian idealism, regarding it as akin to Berkeleyan empirical idealism or some sort of structuralism. Such assurance was, of course, shaken by statistical mechanics in thermodynamics and then quantum mechanics. But such "shaking" may only register with a few...how many physicists, after all, have time to read Kant? Yet when pressed on theoretical issues many physicists will admit they are constructing models and cannot speak about the "ultimate reality," mere speculative metaphysics, unaware that they are defaulting to a near Kantian position. Meanwhile, cosmology today seems to be weaving "theoretical webs" well outside any Kantian remit, moving far beyond experimental range and tumbling headlong into the Antinomies. In CPR B511, for example, we see hints of Copenhagen in "you never come face to face with anything unconditioned...." or "...neither a simple appearance [i.e., final particle] nor an infinite composition [i.e., material universe] can ever come before you." One might say Kant attempted to work out a physics that included the observer. Of course, this is very general and it is easy to contrive this sort of cozy compatibility. I don't know enough about Kant yet to know where he might be in serious conflict with scientific practices, especially in theory of evolution... or perhaps in the evolution and "selection" of theories, where Hegel's criticism of Kant begins. I hope other will offer more specific references to Kant in current philosophy of science, since I'd like to know as well. 

Without further context, the statement appears to, quite simply, point out an incompatibility between concepts of infinity and those of mereology or, indeed, measurement of any sort. A "part" can only be defined in relation to some definable "whole." To "define" is, of course, to render the object of definition "finite" in some sense. It is defined only between some specified limits or "from the outside," so to speak. The old problem of whether a point on a line is a "part" of the line, thus partaking of its two-dimensionality, or a purely mathematical, dimensionless "partition" of the line. So if we grant an "actual" world in which things are in some sense measurable and have "parts" we cannot also have infinity... it doesn't "fit in," you might say. We do reduce things to parts. So an "actual" infinity is impossible, is not commensurate with an actuality of dimensions, wholes, and parts. At least, this would seem to be the negative demonstration that the author, Aristotle or whomever, is driving at. Perhaps a clue to the deeper antinomy here is the whole implication of considering "in our thoughts" some "actual infinity..." Kant might rebut that we can "think" such things but can "know" nothing about them, nor fill them with "actual" content. This "infinity" that has "parts" is, at the very least, not actual. Which is perhaps why Kronecker regarded young Cantor's sets as his generation's corrupting equivalent of LSD, the unleashing into physics of pure intoxicating, useless phantasms. Perhaps he actually had a... point. 

An "ideal" is an idealization. It is generally conceived as a universal principle, even where stated in personal terms. Thus, while it may serve as a guiding principle for many or even "all" rational beings, it cannot be completely actualized by any one particular person. When it is so particular as to be achieved--like the five-minute mile or a human on the moon--it is no longer an ideal. What was "ideal" about it recedes. The same would hold not only for our "highest ideals" but for social norms and "averages." It is not possible to be perfectly, completely "average." The principles are general, the lives described or guided by them are singular and particular. For this reason, the "ideal" recedes even as it is approached, like the "horizon." And where the "particular" life comes closest to the "ideal," the tragedy of this universal inadequacy is vividly rendered. The paradigmatic case is Jesus on the cross, rendered "ideal" yet still suffering and filled with doubt. Or, as with Achilles or Faust, achieving one ideal may only reveal inadequacy under a greater ideal. When the mythical "ideal" is achieved, as with Buddha, say, or the "risen" Christ, a transformation occurs and the "person" is no longer a particular person, but a newly advanced ideal to all other persons. There is nothing abstract in this, it is the way we largely feel about ideals and ambitions in practical endeavors. And it defines us. Our ability to imagine and communicate ideals beyond what actually exits must always exceed our actualization of them. So we are driven by conscience, by the ceaseless "ought." Kant proposed that "ought" implies "can." But not perhaps for anyone in particular. The tragic disparity you describe is, as much of our literature testifies, necessary to a human consciousness beyond mere existence.
