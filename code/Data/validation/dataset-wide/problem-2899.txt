I believe the speed of time to be inversely proportional to the size of the one who perceives the movement of time. Time is, after all, the difference between two dissimilar events. The ability to measure time is directly proportional to the ability to measure one event as dissimilar to another. This can only be done through the senses, primarily via light (and other electromagnetic waves). Light moves at a fixed speed. However, the larger the size of the viewing body, the slower light would seem to travel. Imagine you were the size of the Milky Way galaxy. At this size, the relative speed of light would crawl along at an imperceptibly small rate. In fact, there would be a complete absence of any motion at all, if the rate of time were perceived as we humans feel it. The only way to sense the motion of time is if it moved hundreds of thousands of times faster. A thousand years to us would only be a moment to this galactic body. Now if you were the size of the universe, and all mass and energy were contained within, you would never detect the movement of light and therefore time could not exist. Nothing would ever change. All times would exist concurrently. To those of you that subscribe to the theory that God is the universe, of which we are a part, it makes total sense to say that God is "eternal" or time "doesn't exist" for God. 

You've made a LOT of assumptions in your post, and have a pretty big set of seemingly unexamined presuppositions behind your statements that seem to me to need exposition. 

The fact is, you can't enjoy music in your mind without having the digital information required to reproduce it on demand, so all your different ways of saying the same thing about this action being tantamount to the same thing fall flat on their faces as mere wishful thinking. Please note that I have avoided, as far as I can tell, subjective personal opinions on whether stealing information is immoral or not. However, I have used logic to attempt to show you where your reasoning is incorrect or lacks a proper foundation, and globally, or in "developed nations", logic is something of high value. You've come to a philosophy site, and thus ostensibly are looking for reasoned, rational discussion. If you were looking for the irrational, you wouldn't have come here (right?). Now, I've saved what may be the most important thing for last. You speak of morality and immorality, and suggest that the only anchor for these concepts should be the "moral community of today/the world/developed nations". But how can that be of any value to you here? If you personally define morality as that which most people agree with or most people in developed nations agree with, then a philosophy web site dedicated to pursuit of truth is a horrible place to come. Instead, you should visit a site dedicated to polling the greater public. Run a poll on Facebook, "Do you think illegal downloading of music is wrong", and then abide by whichever answer is given by 51% or more of the respondents. My computer is about to run out of battery power, but I will try to return later to provide you with some links that go deeper into the various points I've made. 

In his critique to Boole and the other algebraic logicians, Frege make a strong use of what is known as "the Priority Principle". The Priority Principle expresses Frege belief that our investigation of the thoughts, should start with considering judgments (thoughts) and not concepts. What I got is that Frege thinks that the Booleans just developed concepts upon Aristotele's logic ( giving a mathematical foundation to it), without investigating if the judgements (categorical and hypotetical sentences?) really represents our thoughts. From that his attempt to revisit what sentences really mean in our language and the consequent introduction of quantifiers...Did I get it right? It may possibly be all wrong because as stated in the question I didn't find a general definition of what judgment and concept mean for Frege, so I tried to extrapolate them but I think I still need clarification. 

I was reading this article called Aristotle on the fourth figure. Thea author while exposing Aristotle theory of syllogism, identify 3 kinds of syllogisms which believes Aristotle to discuss: 

I'm looking for some in depth clarification, can we consider the reduction to absurdum a syllogism? If yes, in which contexts? in which case? why? PS: This question is related to this one I asked, but being the questions both broad I decided to separate them, even though the understanding of one is linked to that of the other. 

The word philosophy means "love of wisdom." Love is an emotion. This is why philosophy has always been more of a humanity than a science. It has more to do with our nature than the physical world around us. We are emotional beings, and taking the philo- out of philosophy would be like taking the muse- out of music. Wisdom is not the thing that drives philosophers; it is the love of wisdom that is the engine of our progress. 

Ethics deal with a set of rules governing conduct that a group of people have agreed upon, while morals deal with an individual's sense of right and wrong. They are intertwined in that each may inherit from the other. However, one may have a "moral dilemma" when their own sense of morals is at conflict with the ethics of their group. For example, let's say you are a cashier at a grocery store. You agreed at your hiring not to let customers steal. The act of doing that, therefore, is unethical. However, you notice a homeless family wander in and the children are hungry. They take a loaf of bread and some milk and leave without paying. You believe it would be immoral not to let them have the food they need. Your sense of morals and ethics are now at a direct conflict. 

If there were no reality, then all would be unreal. If all is unreal, then you are not real, your thoughts are not real, the statements you make are not real, there is no truth or falsehood, there is no reason, there is nothing but nothing (and not even empty space, since that's something. The verb "is" simply isn't available, period). Thus, the person who says "we cannot really prove that there is a reality" is speaking nonsense. He's making a logical statement, containing meaning, conveying an idea that is falsifiable and has the capacity to correspond to other things or not correspond to them. His words have an inherent order, and while open to interpretation, there are many things they cannot be saying such as "the moon is made out of cheese." It is therefore patently obvious that in the final analysis, in his very statement about reality, he's asserting that reality exists. One can't say anything at all without accepting reality. To try to do otherwise is a kind of gross and public self-pleasuring at the expense of other people's value and their comfort—though, if there is no reality, then other people don't exist, and it doesn't matter what we do to them, does it? If words have meaning, then reality exists. If words don't have meaning, then I wish people asserting this would get their gratuitous and disgusting public self-pleasuring as far away from me as possible... If a person asks "Does reality exist?", and thinks there's an answer besides utter nonsense such as "Zlopfnarglesoweiglawepqoijse"—even "well, we can't really tell one way or another"—then he is asserting that reality does exist. There's a more compelling way to say this: It's a category mistake (similar to asking what the color blue tastes like) to ask whether reality can be proven. You can't prove it, and it is meaningless that you can't. You also can't prove logic, or math. Have fun without those. You have to take reality for granted to do anything at all, and most especially to communicate with others on the nature of reality. 

I was reading this article called Aristotle on the fourth figure. The author explains why according to him the introduction of the fourth figure by his students and in today's logic book is a misinterpration of Aristotle view on syllogisms. Anyway the author remarks that nothing is wrong with today's different interpretation given to syllogism, in fact it arises naturally from our current, developed understanding of logic. So it's even more correct. The article end with a John Locke consideration on the value and importance of syllogism, which, under its current interpretation, has lost its deductive power: 

I was trying to grasp some more insights on the diffrence betweeen intensional and extensional. I started reading this article on intensional logic. It seems interesting but I still need to shed light on some doubts I have. The article states: 

Now in my understanding the Categorical Syllogism is the central one and the main discussed. It has 3 figures (or four depending on interpretation) and it can be perfect or imperfect. Hypothetical syllogism is the one (citing Boethius) in which conditional statements appear. It can be divided in simple and complex, but Aristotle never discussed it except for some brief comments on its existence. It was developed by his students and,improved and organized by Boethius. Concerning the role of reduction to the absurdum, maybe I did not really get its role but I'm quite skeptic of its inclusion in the above list. Even though my researches brought up some similiar views like this one:
