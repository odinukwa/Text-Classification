I've not seen one since those old school mechanical odometers that attach to the front axle. I think your best bet is to add a small screw to the mount to lock the computer in place. If you get something small and pointy like this one, less than 1.5mm across the shaft, you should be able to screw it straight into the mount so that the point hits the computer. I suspect you could do this without drilling a hole first, but I would drill the hole. 

In general, yes. They use the same thread/attachment to the hub and they are almost the same width. If you have friction shifting it will work fine, but if you have indexed shifting that will obviously not work - the spacing between cogs is different. There's more information here 

I suggest looking for cracks in the frame, ideally by getting someone else who can sit on the bike and hold the brakes while pushing on the cranks. Wipe it clean, then get down and look for cracks opening up as they put pressure on the cranks and lean back and forth. The dropouts moving will definitely bend a QR skewer. And shortly dump you on the road, BTW, when the frame breaks. Look especially around both dropouts, but also the whole rear triangle. A seatstay breaking loose at the top could possibly cause this problem too (very unlikely but possible). The fix is, obviously, a new frame. The other thing to look for is a chunk knocked off the front inside corner of the dropout. If the axle can grind into there under power that could also produce the problem you see. The half-arse "fix" for that is to move the axle right in the wheel so there's more poking out on that side. Which will work after a fashion for a while. The real solution is to replace the frame, and on a bike that old, that really means replacing the bike. 

The first point is near-meaningless (75% of cyclists were killed during 66% of the day). But 64% not at intersections suggests that side visibility is not likely to be a major issue (at most 36% of fatalities). There's a big collection of links to papers at the Cycling Resource Centre (Australian site, worldwide links). Examples: 

Yes, although it's something that recumbent riders probably do more than upright ones. When your chainrings are something like 20T/50T/70T there's no way to shift that easily with a front derailler, so ankle shifts are often no worse than a modified FD trying to shift bigger jumps than it was made for. Cross chaining is less advisable than usual, you will tend to drop the chain especially with large chainring-large rear cogs, but most gears are usable. The ones that work least well are the ones you shouldn't be using anyway... You can usually shift to a smaller chainring just by pausing as your ankle passes the chain and nudging it down. You will get a bit of chain grot on you from that. Another handy trick is to sleeve a short length of poly pipe onto the drive side of the chain and tie it loosely to the chainstay. That way it'll slide along the chain while you pedal, but you have something clean to grab onto when you're shifting. After about 6 months of that I bought a Rohloff. It seemed easier... 

It's the sort of thing that I would happily buy if it filled a need I had, but I would also be aware of the above and take care with the folding handlebars when I got them. For my folding-bed load bike they might have worked better than the "just turn the handlebars a bit" approach I used when I parked that in a hallway. But I didn't buy a set even though I'd seen pictures of them, because I wasn't convinced that they'd work well enough to make up for the above problems. 

It's probably going to come down to testing, because fatter tyres generally have a lower maximum pressure. I suggest starting with a wider tyre, and it's likely that the 29" MTB tyres are also ISO 622 (700c), so they will fit the rims. If they fit in the frame then they're likely to work better as long as they're rated to a decent pressure. The equation you care about here is weight/pressure = area, in this case weight on the wheel divided by pressure in the tyre = area of contact patch. The bigger the contact patch the more the tyre flexes as you pedal, so the more you have to work. But a wider tyre gives a wider contact patch, so you get less flexing for the same area. A wider tyre is also deeper, so when you hit a pothole there's more give before you pinch flat. Particularly on bad roads, and with difficulty ordering cool new things from your "local" bike shop,the usual solution of high-quality, high-pressure tyres is not going to work too well. If you could, I would suggest such a tyre, but on potholes and gravel roads those give a rough ride (meaning you also want a high-quality hand-built wheel). One other tweak is to suspend the load somewhat. If you put a partly inflated tube folded up under the tool bag in the pannier the tools will bounce on that, reducing the stress on the tyre and wheel when you hit bumps. It will also grind against the sides of the pannier, so I'd put the whole thing in a sack. If that works (I've never tried it, but it sounds plausible), it won't help with the load directly, just the punctures and broken wheels. From memory of a long time ago, I used to carry 50kg or so on a fairly stock MTB when I weighed 70kg, on fairly rough roads. But I also used to go through a rear wheel every year or two. 

no high speeds: rim dynamos spin quite fast, up to 10,000rpm, and that does require effort on the part of the designers. Typically the drive wheel on those will have a radius of about 1cm, or a circumference of 3 1/3rd cm and 30 revolutions per metre. At 10m/s (30kph) that means 300rps or 18000 rpm. This is why they make such a high pitched whining noise when in use. no high torque: a 100kg cyclist standing on a 165mm crank is exerting about 1kN at 0.165m, or 165Nm. That's comparable torque to a mid-range car. I repeatedly snapped a 8mm high tensile bolt in the drive system of my four wheel load bike, and replacing that with industrial freewheels meant buying two of the highest rated units I could find (German conveyer belt parts rated to 250Nm) No high loads: a touring cyclist with 50kg on the rear rack, plus half their 100kg body weight is putting a load of 100kg or 1kN on a 10mm diameter hollow rear axle. Those axles and the dropouts they bear on must be made of hard steel to stand the load, where the load bearing parts of a car or truck are typically made of much softer steel. Only ball bearings are used: modern sealed bottom brackets commonly use roller or needle bearings, as do many headsets. Internally geared hubs have used needle bearings for many years. Sheldon Brown describes roller bearings in his glossary, for example. 

There is an excellent, although complex, chart on page 27 of "Road Traffic Crashes in NSW 2011 (Australia)" (pdf link) but it covers all road users and does not break out cyclsis. I suspect what you're looking for is something like this that only covers cyclist incidents. For non-fatal accidents, BicyclingLife compares three cities (with references) and concludes that motorists failing to give way at stop signs in the most common cause of crashes. 

If you are inclined to speed up, I suggest overtaking on the motorist's left, which is likely to be legal as well as safer. A motorist behind this one is probably going to slow down rather than hit the turning car, so even if the main road you're on has a higher speed than you can normally maintain, you might find you can make it through that gap and around the turning car safely. 

The short answer is: the US "Uniform Vehicle Code" is not law and has no direct effect on road users, so the core premise of your question is misplaced. The UVC is a suggestion as to how legislators might choose to write laws, and also how judges might choose to interpret them. So it neither removes nor recognises rights, and your question could perhaps best be interpreted as "how much does the UVC influence lawmakers" which is unanswerable. So I'm going to address "how do road rules differ between cyclists and motorists", using the example of New Jersey since I prefer that question. More generally in the USA as a whole, motorists have no right to use the road at all while cyclists do. Viz, a motorist can be forbidden to drive but a cyclist cannot directly be forbidden to ride (there are avenues like parole conditions, however). So in that sense cyclists have many more rights than motorists do. However, a licensed motorist travelling in an approved motor vehicle has permission to do many things that cyclists are legally forbidden from. The road laws vary from state to state, and also within the United States of America. You will find that the generic rule is that "all vehicles must travel as far to the right as practicable" and that cyclists actually have more of a list of common situations where courts have decided that "as far as practicable" does not exclude the implicit "without dying" that lawmakers thought was obvious. So there's a list, mostly as a response to case law. Cyclist fined for not riding straight ahead from the right turn lane... exception written into statute "cyclists may ride in the straight ahead lane when travelling straight ahead". You are correct that in theory almost all lanes are "cyclist may use full lane", except that de facto law very rarely corresponds to de jure. Viz, most road users habitually break the law. So it becomes a judgement call on the part of the cyclist as to when it's a good idea to take the lane, and when not. We are seeing some interesting developments with self-driving cars in this area as it has become obvious that if they always obey all the laws they won't be able to operate on public roads. One simple example is following distances on motorways/freeways. Since most motorists drive in the suicide zone all the time, a self-driving car that allows a safe braking distance behind the car ahead is also allowing enough space for a human driver to feel comfortable moving into that gap. (edit to add) An example of the "keep to the right" law: Keeping to the Right (New Jersey) 

I don't know about "oft-cited", because I haven't actually seen any cited. But distinguishing these standard electric assist bicycle from the "electric trail bikes" that have been round for a while, I can guess some of the advantages compared to an unpowered MTB: For the Rider/Purchaser (not necessarily the same person) 

The technical term is, I believe, "woo". Or marketing, if you're an economist. By using nigh-on-infinitesimal differences between their product and everyone else's they can add profit. At least in this case the difference appears to be real, although they don't tell us the uncertainty in the output so for all we know the rubber is 60 +/- 10, making 64/60 effectively identical. It's likely to be much more closely controlled than that, but we don't know. Their website says: 

You should find that on those bikes everything is a bit stronger and heavier than a standard touring bike. Not only are they expected to carry more weight, they're designed to be ridden into places where failures are more difficult to recover from. As well, because they're designed to be ridden off road they'll usually have a lower top tube for better stand-over height, and there are fewer compromises in building a frame like that with smaller wheels. Smaller wheels are stronger than larger ones, mostly laterally but also weight-for-weight vertically (shorter circumference means more material per unit length). This is most obvious with the 306 and 406 wheels used on trikes, but applies also to larger wheels except that the differences are smaller. Larger wheels mean the axle is higher, but also the top of the fork crown and so on, so you're adding the change in diameter to the frame height, not the change in radius. Decent 26" tyres are more available in small towns. With a 700c or 27" wheel you may find that you have a choice of flimsy, skinny tyres and nothing else. (thanks Batman). In a pinch you can tour on cheap MTB tyres more easily than cheap 700c tyres, because a cheap, skinny tyre is going to puncture more easily and not deal with touring loads as well. I've seen a lot of bike shops in small towns in the first world that have BMX tyres, 26" off-road and city tyres, and 700c "race" tyres, all cheap unbranded tyres. It's not a choice between an expensive good brand and a cheap one, it's a choice between two widths or styles of the cheap one. If you have a choice. Or wait a week or more for mail order, because your order goes by air to a major city, then road to a minor city, then bus freight to where you are. Ideally you'd always carry a spare tyre, but in practice that just means you're waiting to replace the spare rather than the currently wrecked tyre. Another factor is ease of building a frame that will accept fat tyres with the wheel size. Once you add a 2.5" tyre to your 700c wheel the frame gets quite large (29er MTB frames), which makes designing for low stand-over height harder and all the stresses on the frame get larger because the tubes are longer making for longer levers. The differences are small, but they add up - a slightly longer lever needs a slightly stronger tube, so now you have a longer tube that's also heavier per unit length, and overall the 10% extra length means a 25% heavier tube. You are also more likely to find disk brakes on expedition bikes, because again they're more robust. Not necessarily the caliper and rotor, but the wheel as a whole. If you get a buckled wheel, with disk brakes the critical question is "does the buckle clear the frame" (ie, does the wheel go round), but with rim brakes it's "can I adjust the brakes to clear the rim" (that ignores "do the brakes still work like that"). The reason you see Rohloff hub gears on expedition bikes is the same. Sure, they add cost, but they are reliable. Not only do you lose the low-hanging, fragile rear derailleur, the straight chain line and high chain-ground clearance means chains last longer. The hubs go 5000km between oil changes and 150,000km or more before needing replacement. As a bonus you get a stronger wheel from wider spaced, symmetrical flanges (that are also taller). Again, it might be 1kg heavier, but when you're loading 50kg or more of stuff on the bike, do you really care? . The motivation for a lot of this is that it's all very well saying "I'll just get a lift to the next town", but if you're riding the Birdsville Track in the off season (recommended to avoid getting run over by tourists) you might wait several days for the next car to arrive. And they might not be able to carry your bike as well as you. So not only do you need enough food for 500km, you need water for at least a week (2-3 days between water supplies, plus a reserve). Then you have to get a lift back to your bike with parts, fix it, and ride on. Much better to pay a bit extra and get a bike that doesn't break in the first place...
