The percent you get from that calculation is a way of describing the total range of a bicycle's (or other machine's) gearing, but it doesn't say anything in and of itself about exactly how low or how high the gearing is. In other words, that 654% here is expressing that the 4:1 ratio of the 44/11 is a 654% higher gear than the 11:18. It's denoting how much variance there is in the entire system. You don't see this way of expressing gearing used very much with derailer gears. Where it does come up is with internally geared hubs. With internal hubs you have quite a bit of freedom to use whatever cog and ring sizes you want, meaning you can "position" the range with more freedom. 

To answer the question of whether you can get away with the .5mm gap, absolutely not. It probably won't be able to clamp securely, and even trying it once could destroy the seattube opening. Bikes are essentially never tolerant of this type of mismatch. I presume you are in this spot because you want to use a seat like a double-rail Brooks or similar that requires a pipe-style seatpost, as opposed to a more common cushy seat, most of which come with a usually-superfluous clamp that can be removed in the case of a post that has its own clamp. If that's the case, I think all you need is a 27.2-31.4 shim, which is oddbal but does exist. 

I believe on this one you put a 5mm wrench in both endcaps and turn counterclockwise. You're trying to get the drive-side endcap off. If it's the non-drive one that breaks free first, there should be a larger size allen fitting in the end of the axle that will be exposed when you take it off. Stick the 6mm or 8mm or whatever it is in that and then you can get the other endcap off, and then the freehub should slide off. Careful not to lose any of the pawls or springs. 

Gear inches. Gear inches are, for better or worse, the most commonly recognized way of making the kind of comparison you're trying to make here, which one is harder to pedal. Gear inches are simply how far one complete rotation of the cranks moves the bike forward. The higher the number, the harder it is to turn the cranks. You hear people make reference to ratio all the time, but usually it's within a niche where the wheel size is implicit, i.e. cross racers talking about 46/11 on a 700 or BMXers and 25/9 on a 20". Gear ratio independent of wheel size is meaningless. Gear inches are actually a deeply flawed concept because it doesn't account for crank length. Sheldon Brown's proposed Gain Ratios system solves this and is pretty easy to argue as the best system possible for describing bicycle gearing. It's based on the movement of the pedal and not the crank. 

Take the right crank off with a big high-leverage allen wrench or socket (I think it's a 10mm). It's got a self extractor so all you have to do is unscrew it, although occasionally disassembling, cleaning and re-greasing the self extractor is good. Use this special tool to remove the lockring that holds the chainring on. Replace ring, torque lockring. Clean spindle lobes, crank bore, and crank bolt threads, regrease all of them, and put it back together with proper torque. This is one of the more totally proprietary ones. You need a specific FSA chainring, unless someone is making third party parts for it. I'm not sure whether the extremely similar looking Cannondale standard is actually the exact same spline pattern for the ring/spider. If it is you may be able to get something like this to work, potentially giving you more options, although keeping the chainline right is also a consideration. Same deal with using the other FSA ones such as the Afterburner rings with the same spline pattern - it's possible that each crank model may want a different offset on the ring for correct chainline. 

The Wheels adapters and similar are cheap and simple, but they add another mechanical interface for things to go wrong with and leave you with all the downside of BB30 (creak-prone frame interface and questionably durable bearings). Most of the upside of going with a 24mm crank in the first place is avoiding those problems. They do have their place, but mostly that place is someone who has an existing crank they want to make work cheaply and easily, or a race team that needs to quickly build up a whole bunch of BB30 bikes with a sponsor's 24mm cranks. The Praxis conversion BBs have a very good reputation, and the FSA press-in threaded adapter also seems to work well when properly installed (ie generously Loctited in place). 

IS mounts (also frequently called IS tabs, disc tabs, etc) are unthreaded eyelets 51mm apart that bolts run through parallel with the hub axle. In almost all cases the brake caliper is then bolted to an adapter that has one set of threads for the IS mounts and another 74mm apart for the caliper. (There are a very few caliper models that omit the adapter, namely XTR BR-M975.) IS has one clear upside: all the threads are in a relatively cheap and easy to replace adapter. The disadvantages are that it's more mechanically complex and expensive since there's always an adapter, and the design of the standard is such that the same adapter doesn't adapt the same caliper to the same rotor size front and rear. A adapter for 180mm in the front is an adapter for 160 used in the rear, for example. With IS, outside of a weird custom fork, 160mm is the smallest size you can use in front, but all bikes with rear IS mounts can take a 140mm adapter. Post mount places two threaded M6x1 holes 74mm apart on the frame or fork in the orientation that a caliper can be bolted to directly without any adapter, or with a post-mount adapter in between along with its supplied long bolts if a larger rotor is going to be used. The most common setup is for the minimum rotor size (the size you'd get the caliper positioned for if no adapter was used) to be 160 front/160 rear on most mountain bikes and 160 front/140 rear on most road and cross bikes, but all sorts of exceptions exist, i.e. downhill forks with 200mm minimum rotor sizes. Although it's seldom denoted this way by frame manufacturers, post mount is really a group of standards that you could call "140mm post mount", "160mm post mount", etc. Post mount is mechanically simpler, cheaper, and arguably more elegant. It has the disadvantage of putting the threads in the frame/fork. How big of a deal this is is a fairly contentious subject. Personally I'm not all that troubled by it, but it does bite people. Note that it's totally acceptable to helicoil a stripped post mount in most circumstances, so the actual risk of ruining your bike forever with one overzealous tightening is pretty small. I have seen new bikes come out of the box with post mount thread issues, I think always on forks, but that's not something a consumer should usually have to deal with. Post mount does not have IS's issue where the geometry is different front and rear. A +20mm post mount adapter does the same thing on both. Facing a rear post mount on the chainstay, where they often are now on road/cross bikes, usually requires an offset facing tool to reach in and do it without bonking into the seatstay. If all manufacturers and dealers were well equipped and did their jobs right, this wouldn't make a difference for consumers. As it is I feel like there's a relatively high proportion of bikes like this sent out into the world still in need of rear post facing, but I don't have any proof. Post mount has increasingly become the norm, probably because it's simpler, cheaper, and inherently more structurally efficient. You don't ask about the Flat Mount standard, but basically it's road-specific and more svelte and structurally efficient yet, and may very well end up winning out on road bikes. 

If it's coming loose so soon after being actually tightened fully, then it's probably one of these 2 things: 

No, it's not typical maintenance, but you do have to take it apart to either replace or perhaps just service (degrease and relubricate) the bearings once in a while. Which you do may depend on what you found and how much disassembly of the bike's other systems it took to get there, which has become everything but the fork and front brake on some bikes, where the link and the internal hose/housing/wire routing are tightly intertwined. You do this more for bearing wear than creaks per se in most cases, although a creak may be the symptom that gets you looking. Riding conditions have a major influence on the level of maintenance required. I live in the US Pacific Northwest, and we have a lot of fine clay soil and moisture that at times seems to create an almost perfect assault on suspension bearings, which would have a much easier life in other regions. The more common thing to do for creaks is drop light oil or dry lube into the pivots, cleaning as well as possible first to avoid working in grit. Also make sure to keep all the hardware properly torqued. Torquing and lubing is the first thing to check when there's a creak from a linkage pivot. 

Here's measurements from 3 in my immediate vicinity: Sapim Sil Brass 14G 12mm, I believe featuring the Sapim Polyax design: 3.7mm Wheelsmith Duristan BN14 (Silver 14g Brass): 3.82mm DT Sil Brass 14g (I think): 3.9mm (I don't have al nipples to measure at home, sorry.) That's more variance than I would have expected. One major point of design consideration for this area of the nipple (the round part and the shoulder) has to do with different manufacturers' schemes to get the nipple to swivel as freely as possible in the rim at whatever angle the design of the wheel puts it at, to avoid bowing of the spoke due which can lead to failure, or to avoid having to take steps in wheelbuilding to correct the spoke line at the nipple (the Bicycle Wheel by Jobst Brandt has more info on this). I imagine you get more swivel the thinner you make the round part, but the tradeoff is you want material there behind the threads to avoid failure, especially with an aluminum nipple. Sapim emphasizes the swivel factor with their nipples so that might explain why their number is the smallest of the above. A related note is that the outside diameter of the area in question doesn't really vary much between gauges. That's one reason why many prefer 1.8mm threaded-end spokes (either straight gauge or Supercomps) for disc brake wheels with al nipples - you get more material there to counteract the extra stress of the brake, which can contribute to nipple breakage. 

You don't have to buy Campy brand cables, but you do have to buy Campy-compatible cables, because they use a head that's a little bit smaller for both shift and brake cables. If you ignore this, it can seem like it's fine, but get stuck in your lever. The alternative in a pinch is taking a little off with a grinder or file. Most shops will have individual carded Campy-compatible cables that are more expensive than bulk but not nearly as much as Campy. Some shops have them in bulk. There is no compatibility issue with using them in your Campy housings. 

Torque on the axle nut won't cause this per se. Think of each axle nut pinching the dropout really hard between itself and the hub locknuts. On a typical hub, if the locknut were loose against the cone, and/or if the axle threads were poorly lubricated, then tightening the axle nut can cause the axle to rotate relative to the cones, ruining the bearing adjustment and adding a bunch of friction. Shimano internal hubs with their burly anti-rotation washers are normally immune to this though. Front wheels generally always spin way more freely than rears. All the Shimano internal hubs are somewhat on the draggy side. If you're noticing it when pedaling, make sure the chain is lubricated. Things that could cause it to be worse than normal: poor hub bearing adjustment, need of internal lubrication using the special Shimano oil bath, dropout alignment causing excess bearing friction/wear, bent axle, something physically rubbing against the hub/wheel/tire, and brake rub. 

Funnily, we actually have many more new rims available with them now then in the early to mid aughts when they were at a low point and it seemed like Open Pros and A719s were the only rims with them. There are now also good DT, Araya, and H+Son rims with them, and maybe some others. They are not extinct. The main thing they do is spread the load to both walls of the rim in order to reduce the risk of fatigue cracking. V-section rims, which have of course risen in prominence, tend to have (or can easily be made to have) a concentrated section of material at the spoke hole, which accomplishes a similar thing in a cheaper and potentially more weight-saving manner. V-section rims tend to not have fatigue cracking issues unless they're either garbage, way over-tensioned, or way under-weight for their use. For the most part you don't really see it on the nicer aluminum V type rims. Double eyelets add weight and cost, are not immediately function-critical, and, most endangering of all, are invisible to consumers. So they have a rough time being something that manufacturers care to mess with. It's worth noting that in a sense, when a box-section design is what you want, double eyelets actually are more relevant than ever. One of the major things that's happened with rims in the last decades is that materials (i.e. fancy niobium alloys) have gotten stronger but not more fatigue-resistant, or at least not at the same rate, and cross-sections have gotten bigger and stiffer with thinner walls. Those are some of the reasons there's more emphasis on building to a tension spec than there used to be. With a classic road rim, however much tension you added that the rim could still take structurally, you could feel safe knowing that it could also take it reasonably in terms of fatigue resistance. It was also easier to accidentally taco them in the stand from adding too much tension. There are rims running around now that are much stronger and stiffer, so you need to cap out your tension even though the maximum strength capacity hasn't necessarily been reached. From a design perspective, double eyelets can help you get access to more of that strength by adding fatigue resistance.
