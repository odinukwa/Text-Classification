In my line of riding, it was imperative that you knew more tricks than your competition, or at least knew how to do them better than the other guy. So yes, in my case you MUST learn tricks to be a "GOOD" rider. After reading about pumping uphill for hours, I am going to take a stab in the dark and assume that you are not a competitor in the X-Games though. If you ride trails, learn to bunny-hop to get over logs. Even road riders should be able to at least jump a curb's height for emergencies (I got squeezed between a bus and a snowbank in Japan and my ability to hop a curb saved me). Endos/stoppies are fun to do and teaches you front-end balance, but not required (can't remember the last time an endo saved me on the trails). Skids, rear-wheel hops, track-stands, everything else you can think of will all help teach you fundamentals of bike handling, but other than a bunny hop, I can't think of anytime any of my tricks helped other than to show off for some girls. 

There is no "physical" reason for someone to be mad that you are following so close behind them, in fact, the physics prove the reverse, unless they want that drag to help them train like how runners will use a parachute. Other than that, you might consider the stopping distance in an emergency, "personal space", and swapping the lead as courtesy reasons for following or not. 

One of the most common reasons for this in a new BMX bike is that the riders tighten the fork bolt without loosening the stem bolts. I used to do the same thing when I first started riding and I just helped 2 other people in the past 3 weeks with the same issue. Once you understand how the fork/stem system work it makes more sense. Back in the 80s, all the BMX necks tightened from inside the forks using a wedge, when they moved to the more modern necks, people still tried to tighten the forks using the bolt that is in the same location (I did too). The best way to tighten your neck/forks is to loosen the stem bolts (A) then get the fork bolt (B) 'sung', do not tighten hardly at all or you will lock up the headset. Move the forks back and forth to ensure that they are not too tight, not too loose, but JUST RIGHT! Then go back and tighten the stem bolts (these you can crank on if you like, but they usually recommend less than 100 lbs) 

Practice! Start out by not pedaling and just get used to controlling the bike with your seat, you might also twist your heels into the frame for better control if you have platform pedals. Lean back, kind of scary, but you have way more control that if you are hunched forward. Even for one hand, it is better to be as far back as your arm will let you. Drop the seat to where you can put both feet on the ground while still in the seat. This will allow you to step off your bike if you are about to fall. You will have to be willing to let your bike fall and get scuffed up. If your bike is more valuable than your body, and you are more willing to get knee surgery than have your bike scratched, you might want to skip this whole thing. I am right handed but prefer my left hand on the bars, might have more to do with being goofy foot than left/right handed. You are going about it correctly now, just raise your hands off a little and be ready to grab the bars if needed. Do it in a safe place like a parking lot until you get comfortable. There is no real advantage to riding with no hands, but one handed should be learned. Strange as this sounds, riding no handed will not help riding one handed, they are different enough that your balance and technique are not as related as it might seem, unless you can have your back completely straight up with one hand on the bars. 

This is NOT a "Curse FS20" by WeThePeople, I am guessing it is from the "XGames" line, but not sure the year or model. 

I dont rotate tires on a bike. I dont think I have heard you should. It will help the tires to wear together but unlike a car, it doesn't cause problems if you don't. I will buy 3-4 rear tires for every front tire. There is also the issue with better performance with some tires on the front vs rear, just not designed to be on both. That said, I tend to stay away from knobbies, even on my "dirt" bike. The knobs put up quite a bit of wind resistance vs road tires, I found this out bombing a really steep road, I could feel them push the wind. You say there are "short stretches of dirt" in your rides. Even when I raced in dirt I used street tires. Knobbies have better grip on acceleration and in turns but it is not like glue. I would rather have the street tires and know I will slide at 35 degrees than have the knobbies and think I can hit a turn at 36 degrees and slide. Especially when you are only using the knobs on "short stretches of dirt", you might consider street tires to help with better traction and road resistance on the street and better wind resistance all around. And there is a HUGE difference in riding knobs on the street vs road tires, they can cause you to slide out way easier on tight turns. 

I have had this happen a few times. Sometimes it was due to mis-matched tire/rim max-PSI ratings (tire could handle a lot more pressure than the rim), or a ripped sidewall. But most of the time, it was the tire not beading correctly. If this is the problem, you will usually not see any evidence of this other than a blown tube. The best way to prevent this is to pump your tire to about 15 PSI then visually inspect the tire all around the rim to make sure the bead is sitting perfectly even around the whole wheel. A low PSI, like 15, allows you to adjust the tire by hand and still keeps it from sliding around too much 

I had a big clip that was supposed to be used to accept a ball attachment for like your windshield suction cup style cell phone holder and you could just clip it to something like a basket or a laptop screen or whatever. It had a strong spring and could be used to mount to that book holder basket thing, but for the life of me I can't find anything similar!! I did a google image search for "motorcycle cell phone holder" it sent back a HUGE list of things, some that might work (also googled "boris bikes" to see what I was dealing with: $URL$ I actually like your contraption, and the holder seems like it could work if you got some hair bands, those elastic rubber band things girls use in their hair: $URL$ and wrapped a few around it. Kind of Ghetto, but it should keep your phone out from under taxis!! 

In the BMX world, they use minimum offset or zero offset necks for flatland. The minimum offset options allow you shorter reach without causing problems being backwards. These are some options (the neck/bar combo might not help, but it was shown as examples of options that exist) In the picture you see a zero offset zero angle bar-neck combo, a minimum offset S&M neck and a Kore neck on a Morales: 

Most master links I have used are designed to fit into the the "barrels" of the smaller links and never actually touch the sprockets, in that sense, there shouldn't be much wear on them. The master link is designed to be removed and so it has more moving parts than the other links and this makes it SLIGHTLY weaker. Unless you are cranking the snot of of your chain like a racer in a gate or straight up abusing it like a BMX street rider, you shouldn't have problems with them. I have run into problems with my master links and so I have almost always just used a chain breaker to bolt the chain on, but I am in the last category, I beat the snot out of my bikes, so I need the extra strength. Basically it comes to this: You shouldn't have a problem with a master link, but if it gives you peace of mind, loop-bolt the chain!! 

After a few days with no accepted answer I figure I might throw something in that is a little outside the box: I used a Kelty Child Carrier for my kids until they were old enough to ride their own bikes. Something very similar to this: $URL$ I used it to go downhilling, trails, actual hiking, skateparks (bowls and some smaller jumps), store, school (I was in school and take them sometimes) and when you get to where you need to dismount, you can leave your bike and keep the kid strapped, VERY useful after they have fallen asleep, then when you get to your destination they have a chair right there and you never had to wake them up for ANYTHING! I modified it with a camelback chest strap to keep the child's shoulder straps together so they wouldn't fall out if slightly inverted. The best part of it was the waist belt, get that strapped right and you dont even notice the kid on your back!! So nice! I gave mine to my brother when he had his first, and he LOVES it too!! 

It depends on how aggressive you ride. If you are a casual rider and rarely do many jumps or drops then they should work just fine. I am a pretty aggressive rider and have snapped more than my fair share of skewers trying to keep the wheel in place. I have also snapped a number of hollow axles because they are just not strong enough for the riding I do. So I switched to solid axles which are stronger (ultimately cheaper too). I have never had a problem with theft since I lock my both wheels with the frame. If solid axles are not what you are looking for, I like the pitlock (that doesnt have the hex outer body), they can both be removed by a determined thief with a pipe-wrench, but the inactive side is smaller and harder to grip. Either one will hold the wheel in place about the same though. 

As long as you don't take your bike on a long strenuous ride or torque the snot out of it, you should be OK. Make sure the remaining 4 are properly tightened. Normal commuting should be fine. 

If you are just commuting and dont need much performance wise, you might look into the foam inserts like these: $URL$ They are a pain to get on and almost impossible to get off (I had to cut my tire to get it off) but they never get flats. The biggest problem is that I need my tires to be 85+ psi and I have not found any to replicate over 65. Another problem some say is that if you hit a pothole that the impact goes directly into your rims, with weak rims that would be a problem, but I have triple walls. But like I said, I would only use these on commuter bikes rather than performance bikes. 

I ride my bikes HARD (BMX park/street/dirt) and back in the 90s we had to use what ever parts we could find. Since no one was making parts back then for BMX, it was usually MTB parts. Even back then and with all the abuse we put them through, (yes, even flipping seats and posts backwards to fit our needs) the parts seemed to hold up pretty well (Except the hollow axles used for quick release, those snapped pretty easy), about the only thing was the posts would kink, but that was because they were raised way high and dropped from 30-40 feet up off the ground. I can't tell what brand of post that it, but it looks more solid than the crap we used back then, and we beat them up pretty good. My guess is that you will be fine.
