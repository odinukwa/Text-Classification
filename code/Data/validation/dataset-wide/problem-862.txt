It's true that planets usually don't flicker, or twinkle (or scincillate, as astronomers like to call it). The reason is that they are close enough that they are actually seen as a disk with a larger diameter than the atmosphere can "wash out" (the seeing disk). Stars, on the other hand, are point sources, and this point jumps back and forth on the sky, as the light takes slightly different paths through the atmosphere. This is what we see as twinkling. I can think of three reasons that may make a planet twinkle nevertheless: 

On the one hand an object spans a smaller angle the farther away it is, as expected. On the other hand, due to the expansion of the Universe and the finite speed of light, very distant objects were closer to us when they emitted the light we see today. At that time they spanned a larger angle. The following paragraph is hard to understand without a drawing , so have a look at the drawing in this answer, which may help. The light from the edges of a galaxy that happened to travel toward where we were at the time it was emitted did not reach us, because by the time it arrived to that place, we were no longer there. But the light that happened to be emitted toward some point behind us reached that point at the same time as we did, so that's what we see. The exact turnover, the threshold between "looking smaller because far away" and "looking larger because closer in the past" depends on the expansion rate history of the Universe, as well as on the way that light propagates in the Universe, which in turn depends on the densities od the various constituents of the Universe. The interrelationship of these quantities is given by the Friedmann equation. 

We have been calling the star by looking at which we can make out the direction of the North Pole the North Star. This was the only method at the disposal of the sailors during the days when they did not have any compass with them. When the axis of the earth would point toward Denab, Denab would become the North Star. When it would point toward Vega, Vega would become the North Star. Likewise, when the axis would point toward Thuban, Thuban would become the North Star. When we look at the Polaris from the earth, the Big Bear appears to be revolving around it. So I am curious to know which constellations would appear to be revolving around the Denab, Vega and Thuban when the axis of the earth would be pointing toward them due to wobbling of the earth. 

If we convert the mass of all the stars and all the planets which must be weighing trillions and trillions of tonnes by the equation E = m.c^2 it gets converted into an unimaginable amount of energy. Would so much of energy not have gone into the evolution of the Universe? I am at a great suspense whether the Big Bang theory or any other theory at all answers from where so much of energy would have come that would have got converted into so many trillions and trillions of tonnes of the mass of all the galaxies put together. How we can believe in the big-bang-theory unless we know from where so much of energy would have arrived? 

The Sun in Extreme UV, during a particularly violent solar flare (from the SOHO gallery). Several of the photos in your second link are images taken by the Japanese space telescope Hinode, which observes both in the optical (i.e. visible by humans), X-rays, and far UV. If these are shown in orange, again it's just to make them visible to us, and you may say that they have been "doctored to meet our expectation". In this way, I like better when they choose a color such as all green, so we know it's "false color". 

It's not impossible, but does require a bit if a special set-up. Normally, the light from a star is redshifted mainly due to its velocity toward/away from us (a small, but important, contribution comes from gravitational redshift, when the light climbs up the potential of the star). Because stars tend to rotate, light coming from the side of the star rotating away from us is slightly more redshifted than the light coming from the side rotating toward us. If a large prominence is present on one side, then because the prominence is hotter than the average surface temperature of the star and thus emits at shorter wavelengths, the combined spectrum will exhibit a larger redshift at short wavelengths. Since the flux from the prominence alone is, after all, small compared to the total flux, the effect would be rather small, however. A more common mechanism that may cause a differential redshift is stellar outflows. If large amounts of gas are being expelled (e.g. in protostars or AGB stars), then atoms and molecules in the outflowing material will absorb some of the light from the star. These absorption lines are then blue shifted wrt. the "systemic" velocity (i.e. the velocity of the star wrt. us), again skewing the redshift as a function of wavelength. A spectral line may even be seen both in emission and absorption, known as a so-called P-Cygni profile. The figure below (from the Wiki article linked to) shows the same intrinsic wavelength (here H$\alpha$) both redshifted and blueshifted (by rotation and thermal motion), but the blueshifted light is absorbed by the outflowing atmosphere: 

If we have 13 months a year and 13 Zodiac Signs instead of 12 months and 13 Zodiac signs instead of 12 signs as suggested by me and have "28-day months" we would be benefited yet in one more way. We shall have precisely 4 weeks per month because 7 x 4 = 28. However, it would make for only 364 days in a year. So we would have to cover this flaw by redefining the year as a period of "13 months and a leap-day" for each non-leap year and two leap-days for each leap-year. in addition, if we may commence the 13 months-calendar from 22nd December instead of 1st January all Zodiac spells would begin on the 1st of each month and would end at the end of each month. So my suggestion merits consideration according to me. 

According to me following reason of mass accumulation of earth has been completely overlooked so far. The sunrays that fall on the oceans travel deep into water and finally get converted into mass which eventually results in "mass-accretion of the earth". So earth is continuously getting heavier due to the mass being added to it due to this reason year by year. Therefore, should this also not be one of the reasons why the orbit-time of the earth (time taken by it to take one round of the sun) is bound to change (increase or decrease) with time?
