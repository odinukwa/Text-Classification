I have a pair of dumbbells and access to a few machines. I can do the following exercises with proper form and I can't have a trainer to learn newer exercises now. Lower body: Lunges, Bulgarian split squat, step up, hamstring curls Abs and back: Back extension, plank, side plank Upper body: bench press / push up, chest flies, shoulder press, shoulder front and lateral raise, rear delt flies, rows (not sure about form though), lat pull I'm not able to figure out which pair of exercises balance each other and if all muscle groups get hit with the above exercises. 

I have read about pull ups/chin up. Is there anything I can do with a barbell? My workout regime now consists of squats, deadlift, lunges, bench press, rows and overhead press. 

The only thing that's noticeably lacking is pullup equipment. You're stuck with either buying a bar, or you could spend $30 and get one that fits in a door frame: Iron Gym Total Upper Body Workout Bar. I have one of these and it works great for pullups. Unless you're really short you won't be able to do kipping or butterfly pullups, just deadhangs. 

8:34 Conclusion I wore the Vibram's both days without issue. I actually think they're making me more aware of my foot, knee and hip position and preventing the poor form that sturdier shoes allow me to use safely. I need to be super conscious of keeping my knees spread when squatting. I've found the following cues help me: 

CrossFit is a free program. It's completely "open source" insofar as the exercises are published and free to use without charge. You just can't slap CrossFit logos on everything and try to make money off of it without becoming an affiliate. You can do a great many CrossFit style workouts with bodyweight alone. Some ideas include: 

I have been doing plank hold in good form since atleast 2-3 months. I get shakey after 10 seconds even though I can hold it between 60-75 seconds. I don't see any improvement in shakiness. What does it mean? Is it Weak core? 

I used to follow a faulty workout regime that emphasised anterior chain more while stretching the posterior chain more, meaning horrendous posture and muscle strength imbalance. I'm considering yoga to ease the tightness in chest, shoulder and hip flexors. But I'm getting conflicting information about whether yoga will be able to fix the muscle strength imbalance. Information like in order to strengthen back, glutes and hamstring, one has to lift weights and that yoga may not be a good idea for this purpose. Can anyone shed some light in this regard? 

I've also begun to supplement with Glucosamine, but I don't expect to see results until 2-3 weeks later. I'm going to refrain from box jumps, jumping air squats, and jumping lunges until I feel no pain whatsoever in my knee. Followup (Injury +8 days) I continued to stick to my CrossFit schedule. I accomplished one of the most intense CF workouts on I+4: Murph (scaled pull/push ups and squats by 1/2). I wore sneakers instead of Vibrams. Neither the running nor air squats were an issue for my knee. I+6's workout had my a little worried: 60 seconds jumping squats with a 45-lb barbell. This is exactly what injured my knee to begin with. Luckily I saw my PT earlier this day. She confirmed that I have an ACL strain due to my overly aggressive jumping air squats in combination with poor form. My ridiculously short and weak hamstrings prevent me from getting deep in the squat without losing anterior pelvis tilt. As my hamstrings get tight they pull my pelvis and the rest of my body forward, shifting my weight toward my toes. I compensate for this by shooting my knees forward over my toes. This puts an enormous amount of shear on my knee joint. It's really important to keep your tibia vertical if you have a weak/injured ACL. The PT did some PNF hamstring and quad stretches with me, and prescribed lots of box squats with vertical tibias. I'm to do 50 of these a day, keeping my knees back and maintaining my lumbar curve. As they get easier I am to lower the box until I get down to my ankles (this will take a while). She had me try some jumping squats with a PVC pipe and corrected my form here as well, again emphasizing keeping my knees back. I performed 33 45-lb jumping squats in 60 seconds without any knee pain! None of the basic CF movements have been deemed off-limits by my PT. For exercises, like the push-press, where my knees are supposed to come forward I have to compensate by taking a wider stance and opening my hips up. This allows me to keep my knees back further, but still get the benefit of a powerful hip extension. (I sacrifice sheer power by compensating this way, but I don't injure myself). Here are some videos that are must watch for fully understanding and working with sore knees: 

I would suggest you to get to a shop, where the worker is a runner by him/herself. I got my current running shoes ("saucony") from such a shop. You normally pay a little more, but the experience of a long distance runner, who has run him/herself is priceless. For example (in my case) he investigated my old running shoes and said "oh yeah, you need shoes that prevent you from running on the outer foot". This is something I would not have known, and he knew only by looking at my old shoes. A little hint: The more solid the ground you run on, the softer your shoe sole should be. A trail running shoe is most likely for soft forest ground, so keep away from them, they are far too hard. I would highly recommend to get a proper guidance by a professional runner. EDIT: JohnP pointed out some great articles about the shock absorption of shoes, regardless of price and brand, etc. However, I still think, that a professional runner can get you a shoe that (at least partly) corrects your feet posture an running style (which I would not want to miss anymore). Thanks John! 

I have a strength imbalance in both side of my hips as well as obliques. For this reason, I tend to descend somewhere towards left (my stronger side) and not in the middle during squats. I also find step ups more difficult on my weaker side. I have been to PT's, they couldn't fix it despite lots of sessions. Also, I can't afford for more. And trying to address obliques directly (like side planks) causes a lower back pain - it's more like pinching sensation. I have heard that treating it as problem in form may be a solution. Meaning reducing load to one in which I can maintain proper form and then working upwards should resolve the issue. Does this how it really works? I have been very sedentary due to lots of unresolved injuries for long. Looks like I'm a starter again and starting with very low weights now... 

6:03 I felt some twinges in my knee during the cleans, but I found that focusing really hard on preventing my right foot from pronating and my right knee from turning inward I avoided all pain. I also felt fine doing 5 minutes of jump rope during my warmup. It's a bit of a funny coincidence but the same day I asked my question here the Mobility WOD posted a video about poor hip ROM. Kelly's description of my squatting technique (feet turned out) is spot-on, and I found that the mobility exercises shown in the linked video really helped me keep my knees from shooting inward and putting strain on my MCL/ACL. Injury +3 days Today I decided to go all out and try a modified Fran today. Success! 21-15-9 

With very minimal equipment you can add even more exercises. Since you mention home gym I'm going to assume that a set of dumbbells is a given: 

Well, as the name suggests, you could maybe go to your local farmer and get some fresh whey. If this does not suit you, you could try to get some natural whey powder. I do not mean the , but the really natural whey. If you still do not want the powder, you could simply drink milk. It also has a decent amount of whey protein by nature.... There does not seem to be a real alternative besides that. I dug through some posts on the internet now and some suggest egg whites, but I think the best would be a whey shake. The benefit of a shake in general is the better and faster digestability, so maybe you should really consider it. 

I would suggest you an online or personal trainer. I once had an online coach as well. I got a more or less personalized nutrition plan, a new workout routine each week and skype sessions to talk about slight modifications in order to reach my specific goal. There were other people doing the more or less same workouts and there has always been a community to power you (it was a facebook group). By now, approx. 4 years have passed since I had this course and I still like the plans I got. 

I want to be able to convert the power required to do one exercise, specifically running down then up four flights of stairs, into terms of a run of distance x in time y. I've found several work and power calculators online, but none of them include stair runs. Here are the variables: 

I highly recommend a product called IdealStretch. The standing/seated hamstring technique is ok, but at some point you're going to cheat and bend your back. The IdealStretch gives you all the benefits of the partner stretch that Dougman describes, but without needing another person. I've been using this for a few weeks now and I've gone from only being able to touch my ankles to being able to wrap nearly my entire hand over my toes. One great thing bout the IdealStretch is it easily allows you to load your hamstrings at both ends. If you don't know what this means, let me elaborate a bit. Your hamstrings are attached at two locations: your hips and your knees. Your hamstrings are stretched when your knee is in extension and your hips are in flexion. If you lock your knee fully extended and then begin to flex your hip, you're going to feel that stretch targeted high on your hamstring where it attaches to your hip. If you do the opposite, flexing your hip first and then extending your knee, you'll feel the stretch target your lower hamstrings where they attach to your hip. 

I've been sick for the last two weeks and my doctor told me to get Finalgon, which is a heat cream. (Note: Finalgon is not only reacting with the skin, like some sticking plasters) While I really liked the effect and it really benefited my curing, it felt like it was stimulating my blood circulation. This made me curious, if there is any benefit using heat cream when it comes to regenerating from aching and sore muscles? I do not want to question the effectiveness of heat creams in general, but if there is any value using it when trying to regenerate faster from hard workouts (which in my case is bodybuilding)? Maybe because of its stimulating effect? I came up with this, as I regularly read about blood circulation aiding supplements and foods.
