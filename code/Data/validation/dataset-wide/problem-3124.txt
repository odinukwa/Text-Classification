Following independence, Kazakhstan instituted policies to reaffirm its cultural dominance, such as requiring Kazakh be spoken as the only official language. Ethnic Russians found the policy discriminatory and now the percentage of Russians stands at 30%. Repatriation of Russians was discussed with the Russian government, but found to be inappropriate. At this time, the issue remains unresolved and is a source of conflict and political dispute. So large and entrenched of a minority group is considered to be nearly impossible to resettle. I'm not sure about the international reaction, the policies of the USSR were routinely condemned in the West, although many still supported them as a positive quality of ruthless pragmatism. 

Bernays' main object was to use propaganda for commercial interests. The first forms of propaganda were thus advertising. The word propaganda comes from "propagation" as in "propagation of the (Catholic) faith." The word first took on a negative connotation when Protestant reformers felt that the Catholic Church was spreading an improper view of Christianity. The concept of propaganda thus evolved over time from the Reformation to the 20th century. John Locke wrote an important rhetorical treatise. Ancient societies have always spread messages, but this is (applied) rhetoric, not propaganda. The reason is that the messages were not designed for a "mass audience," but would be crafted for very specific audiences. Speeches by Cicero for example were not written to have universal appeal to most of the Roman population. There was no propaganda in the Roman Empire. 

The IVC also rebuilt their homes and public spaces on top of the old ones every few years, yet they were able to keep the straight angles in the city planning design due to using brick, because its easier to stack neatly with brick than stone without any extra efforts. Due to their geography, which caused constant flooding, these rebuilding efforts were constant. Stone is much more permanent and makes sense for most ancient peoples. But brick better suited the IVC. 

The claim in the documentary is that the Americo-Liberians, the term for the ruling class of Liberians of American descent, "immediately" went to Liberia and enslaved the natives using something akin to the chattel slavery system to force them to work on plantations. That is absolutely false. The pictures of plantations that can be viewed on the blog might be related the Firestone Company, which operated slave labor in the 1920's, but Liberia was founded in 1842. The Americo-Liberians believed they were cultural superior and believed they would "civilize" the other Africans. This ended in many wars with the native peoples, considered "civil wars" since they never took the outlook of racial superiority. (wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Liberia) In the 1920's when they joined the League of Nations, the precursor to the modern United Nations, they were investigated for claims that slavery still existed in Liberia by the presidential challenger of Charles D. B. King. It was found: 1. that the native tribes were still using domestic servitude, which could be considered slavery 2. POW's from the civil wars against the native peoples of Liberia and criminals were being used under an unjust "convict labor system" that should be considered slavery "...Vice President Yancy [of Liberia] and other high officials of the Liberian Government, as well as county superintendents and district commissioners, have given their sanction for compulsory recruitment of labor for road construction, for shipment abroad and other work, by the aid and assistance of the Liberian Frontier Force; and have condoned the utilization of this force for purposes of physical compulsion on road construction for the intimidation of villagers, for the humiliation and degradation of chiefs, of captured natives to the coast, there guarding them till the time of shipment [to Fernando Po and Sao Tome.] The Firestone Company was implicated in this scandal. 

The examples from history we have are revolutions against autocratic regimes, monarchies. This is the reason why there should be concern about China. In China very little protest is allowed and the people have little control over who is in power. The Muslim Brotherhood was founded by college students when education was reformed in that nation, as well. It is now very influential in the region, which has seen some peaceful and some violent revolutions. I don't think there is an example of a violent revolution led by college students against a liberal democracy in Europe. There have been peaceful "revolutions" such as the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, although that is not the only example. Iceland might also be considered a peaceful "revolution." In other words, protest is often a useful outlet for unemployed youth in liberal democracies, rather than violent revolution, because they can effectively change their government through this means. 

According to this Wikipedia page on the Revolution of 1905 (Bloody Sunday), socialism became important politically in Russia shortly after the accession of Tsar Alexander II in the 1860's and 1870's. A few reasons are offered: 

Does anyone know how a lower level scientist or other support staff were brought on to the Manhattan Project specifically? Was there a way for the government to target specific kinds of skill sets, for instance, similar to the "doctor draft" instituted during Korea. And was it common during WWII to use non-voluntary "deferments" for strategically critical civilian personnel? Note: The other possible mechanism I can think of is that his grant was cancelled from war-time cut-backs and he was offered the job on another project with the government, even though he didn't know what it was and this prevented his possible drafting. The interview is unclear. Any information is appreciated! 

Religion has been used by all groups of peoples to help them understand and regulate warfare and thus also to convince people to take part (recruit them). Provided here is a Wikipedia list of war gods. In a monotheistic religion, the role of the war god is combined as a trait of the one god. In the Old Testament, the Jewish God can be seen commanding his people to go to war to defeat peoples who commit grave sins. In other religions, the people might take captives to use as human sacrifice, such as the pre Buddhist deity Dayisum Tngri. Burial of slaves, often war captives, at a master's death was a common form of human sacrifice in other cultures. The Nuristani people are a very old culture. They are mentioned in the Rigveda, one of the world's oldest manuscripts, composed in 1500-1200BCE. Their war god is Great Gish. After an enemy is killed in battle, a victory dance is given to Great Gish. This type of religious ritual would have been common among tribes without writing systems, as well, so it is impossible to know which peoples did this first. 

They also occur in early Christian writings not recorded in the Bible and in other religions of the ancient near East. The Jews often viewed heaven in terms of a temple. God dwelled in the inner most place in the temple and the closer one came to God the more elevated and sacred that place in heaven was. Here is an excellent source about Temple Motifs in Jewish Myticism 

The source of this information comes from the personal memoirs of Yakuza crime boss Kodama. The event never took place, though, so verifying or disproving it is impossible. According to Kodama, he was asked to raise a small army to put down the protests and protect the US president's motorcade and says that he prepared to do this. His proof is that in exchange Ishi signed his memoirs. The protestors were almost entirely supporters of the Socialist Party. There is some evidence some were also right-wing. While the new treaty would be a great improvement for the status of Japan, it renewed some terms for American military bases and thus any group opposed to American military presence would not support it. The Yakuza would be ultra right-wing, but its political interests would likely be mostly to support the prime minister and thus bolster their power through the political establishment by granting favors. The Yakuza under Kodama were probably used for anti-communist political activities, but the sources for the claims are highly conspiratorial and thus difficult to verify which if any information is true. The information is included in the book Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld. It is a book by investigative journalist, David E. Kaplan. It is an award-winning best-seller, but not a scholarly resource. President Eisenhower did visit Okinawa in 1960. US soldiers were used to secure the president against the large numbers of protestors. There were over 100,000 US soldiers in Japan in 1960, so it is a suspicious claim that it would be necessary or thought appropriate to use Yakuza. The Secret Service did exist for the purposes of presidential protection at this time. The president's visit to Tokyo was cancelled after a student protestor was killed at the request of Ishi also making it less likely that Ishi planned a heavy handed crack down on protestors using a criminal gang. 

Agricultural policy. The Tsar ended serfdom making a class of tax-paying peasants. The taxes were too high and the amount of land given to each peasant too small however to allow them make a living and in many cases even feed their families. A famine began in the 1890's. Industrial policy. The Tsar spent great sums on new infrastructure projects and gave money to industrialists to build factories in Russia. Peasants moved to work in these factories where they came in contact with new socialist ideas, such as striking for better working conditions. Striking was illegal, however, sending the peasants to organize with more radical elements. Education policy. University education and disciplinary requirements were loosened and schools became breeding grounds for socialist ideas. Half of arrests of socialists in the 1860s and 70s were students. Socialism was aided by ethnic minority groups threatened by Russification efforts 

In the United States, we have specialists who treat lung conditions called respiratory therapists. My mother was one in the 1990's and she said it was very difficult to convince many elderly patients with asthma to quit smoking since they had been told by their doctors in their youth it improved their asthma. She dealt with hundreds of patients with lung conditions, most who would have been young in the 1920's-1940's. I think this is pretty good proof that this odd medical advice was indeed given. Smoking causes the airways to constrict, so it can reduce some symptoms of asthma such as wheezing, even though the person is less able to breathe, so it is bad for them and can cause a lethal asthma attack. Quitting smoking also temporarily causes coughing fits as the airways open up, so you can see why these people were skeptical. I imagine this is how such wrong-headed medical advice became orthodox. People thought it was so good for the lungs, you can see the cyclists in the Tour de France smoking along the way in now iconic photos from the era. 

The other major reason for organization of countries that made up the Axis is that no one else wanted to be their ally, because they were expansionist and aggressive and were untrustworthy as allies. Germany and Italy made many attempts to ally with the West. But since the Soviet Union really wanted to be in the Axis, probably the Axis being allied against them was genuinely ideologically motivated and not only realpolitik. The Anti-Comintern Pact which was the fore-runner of the creation of the Axis. 

Regarding the delegates Since about 1980, all states use the "unit system." When a candidate wins a primary or caucus, they are not awarded all the delegates, but only the proportion of the delegates of their popular vote total, which is awarded at each precinct level. My personal experience is that small vote totals are not always reported to the mainstream media, which is often receiving its information from the major candidates' press office and/or media services, therefore this data is not readily available and simply missing from the Wikipedia chart. Upon further review, its very apparent that Wikipedia's commentary on Bush's super delegate total is horribly erroneous! There was one abstention by the Republican super delegates, not 482/650, which would be a very bad showing indeed and incongruent with his overwhelming win of the popular vote. So in other words, Bush was in fact well supported by his party. Recent Presidential Primary Challenges It would be incorrect to assume that recent presidents have not faced primary challenges. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and George Bush Senior had significant pressure. The president now has about $80 billion in discretionary funds. Jimmy Carter used these funds extensively to win over (bribe) political allies. The Quandary of Bill Wyatts Bill Wyatts has never held a political position, has no advanced degrees, has no impressive military or business accomplishments. He is a graphics designer of T-shirts who says his reason for running for governor of California was, "boredom." In other words, he's not very qualified to be president, although he is great self-promoter and rather entertaining. So what is he doing as the runner-up in a presidential primary is a very, very good question. Each state and state party set the other rules regarding primaries and these can vary considerably. Some states have open primaries-anyone can vote in them-or completely closed to only registered party members. Some states may make it very difficult for candidates to be placed on the ballot, requiring large numbers of signatures and large fees, or there may be almost no requirements. Many third party candidates argue that the ballot requirements have become stricter in recent years. Stricter ballot requirements obviously keep out more candidates from running. Primaries have become more expensive in recent years, as well. The unit system made primaries much more expensive by causing candidates to need to campaign everywhere to gain votes. Money used by a party during a primary is not used during the general election, so it benefits the party not to fight amongst itself. Wyatts is sort of an outsider. He is a Democrat cross-over and not a career politician, so he may not be following the party "playbook," but this is merely my assertion. Computer models are used to decide which states candidates should spend the most time campaigning in. These are usually the split ticket or swing voter states. The traditional early and large caucuses will also always get a lot of attention. Campaigns pour money in those areas. Wyatts is doing well in his home state and states that are not these "battle ground states." I think that should be expected, since he would have less competition in those areas. 

The Japanese were well aware of fascist ideas in the 1930s. They probably were not highly influential during this time period though. The largest reason is that fascism uses a dictator, which would negate the role of the emperor. There were few political parties and organizations that used the label of "fascist" and communism was much more popular among the people as a solution to economic ills. The changes from the more liberal Taisho democracy that brought them closer to true fascist countries were brought about for a few reasons: 

Thucydides sometimes does not always make a proper distinction between facts and myths. Here is an example of him extending the Illiad into his historical work seamlessly. 

According to Spivak, epistemic violence occurred through the marginilization of certain voices within Western discourses. These voices belong to the "subaltern." It is similar to Said's idea of "otherness" in Orientialism. 

The subdivisions of heaven and the theme of a vision of an ascent to heaven originate from Jewish mysticism. Different parts of the Talmud come from different times, but this idea is very old. 

The Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain in the 18th century. The precursor to the Industrial Revolution was the Enlightenment. This occurred when European scholars rediscovered Greek and Roman ideas. One outcome was the discovery of the scientific method, as well as an overall "rational" viewpoint towards scholarship, and Europeans applied it in their home countries with great results. Great Britain seems to share many qualities with the Classical ancient societies of Greece and Rome, so I wanted to know what was specifically different about Great Britain that allowed it to develop the Industrial Revolution. The following are a few things that were the same: 1) Empires with wide trading networks 2 ) "Rational" science, technology and philosophy 3) Rome had a strong legal system. The British legal system was based on the Roman one and is an explanation for its protections of property rights. 4) "Democratic" societies (even if not everyone could actually vote) 5) Urbanization 6) Rome understood the concepts of an assembly line and specialization, which Great Britain rediscovered through Adam Smith The following are things I believe might be dissimilar: 1) The invention of the internal combustion engine/ mechanization through steam power I feel I am either overgeneralizing or have left things off the second list.
