The most politically correct one would be the one selected by that minority group. In all cases of vernacular syntax, there's a wave of names that will be attributed to a certain group or groups. It follows a fairly recurring progression: 

Not really. There's a similar argument that cultures with different languages are better at math due to how their number-words are constructed. For example, in English, the number of 11 is called "eleven" and the number 15 is "fifteen", but in Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish that number is basically called "10 & 1" or "10 & 5". That doesn't sound difficult but for early language learners, adding the extra baggage takes up time. Fifteen plus twelve has to be translated to 15 + 12 then 10+5 + 10+2 and then you get the answer, 27, which is then 20+7 or twenty seven. It's actually worse in other languages... for example, 99 is ninety nine in English, in Korean it's "9 10's & 9", but in French it's quatre-vingt-dix-neuf... which is literally "4 20s & 10 & 9". Because there's less 'lag' in Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish, they've found that children in those cultures as a whole understand math faster, which propagated the original stereotype that the entire culture is just seemingly better at math than Western cultures. However, once those students get into more advanced mathematics including numbers in the abstract, all of that edge vanishes, so all cultures should be on the same level... however, there is a lingering psychological impact. Those who basically learned to hate math starting at those very early ages do even worse once math becomes abstract. Having a base 8, or octal, math isn't going to be structured all that differently in the grand scheme of things. Anything that goes down to base 2 will be effectively the same for any large computations. Now if we had 4 fingers on one hand and three or five fingers on the other... THAT would most likely have an impact. 

The red could be a dye so a fluid leak would be visible and therefore easier to patch without taking the whole unit off line for diagnostics. An internal gauge might show a drop in fluid pressure, but wouldn't show where the damage has occurred. 

Having "round architecture" doesn't necessarily mean every building's floorplan is a circle. The Round City of Bagdad is an example of high-level planning for a round city. The city was divided into four quarters by two perpendicularly intersecting streets that ran from end to end of the outer perimeter wall and terminating at four gates. Each of the four gates pointed towards a different city — Basra, Kufa, Khurasan and Damascus — and named after that. The gates opened onto an arcaded street running all around the exterior inhabited ring. 

Since other replies are addressing the planet criteria, I'll address the scale itself. A number from 1 to 20 can only measure one parameter, or rather I can only convey one concept with this scale: Viability. Sequential numbers imply there are steady increments of viability along this scale. If terraforming were possible, you'd have to go through each sequential state. If the conditions are not sequential but each state is more or less unique, you'd use letters of the alphabet. They would probably correspond to the order in which they were discovered and codified. But I suggest you consider a compound number system that can convey more than one parameter. For example J7 would not be the seventh J, rather it conveys two separate concepts represented by a letter and a number. For inspiration: the web uses hexadecimal numbers to describe colors. The first 2 digits are the color red, the next 2 are the color green, etc. After you learn the system you can estimate how bright and the general hue by comparing the 1st, 3rd, and 5th digits. Also interestingly the numbers count from 0 to 9, then from A to E. Throwing in Greek letters helped Star Trek sound esoteric (or possibly math/academic). So consider a compound number system where the digits are represented by various counting systems. 

Whatever is cheaper Your version of magic may include conservation of energy (???), but any type of free-market system (that is, there's no law saying what you must use) will lean on conservation of profit. If the protag's in an area, there's going to be leaning on whatever is in large abundance - If the area is like Venice, you're going to leaning largely on water travel. If you're in an area where you can hire an augmented 'running man' cheaper than purchasing and maintaining a horse, camel, mule or dog team, you will. There are also externalities to consider - If you're in a city or urban environment, do you want to deal with domesticated animal waste? Where are the animals kept when not being used? If you're in a rural environment, how does the environment impact an augmented person? Rain, Heat, et cetera? (I'm thinking of the story of the British trying to use the Irish for Slave labor, but they couldn't take the heat in colonies, which led to the slave trade to Africa) Are you advancing the plot in some manner? Is this a debate that the characters are experiencing, or the society as a whole is discussing? Are the augmented humans actually willing (skilled worker) or brainwashed to be willing (serf/slave)? Will there be a progression of enchantment, where today's work animals or augmented people pulling wagons will be replaced by self-pulling wagons? 

I'm not aware of any ships that can cross oceans at the desired speed, which implies that only those who can fly over the atlantic / pacific oceans will survive. And then, fuel will be an issue -- that many airplanes trying to make the same trans-oceanic journey at the same time will be difficult. So, many die stuck in traffic jams, trying to head west. Many on the western coasts, and in boats off of the western coasts, overtaken. Lots of airplanes that go down in the middle of the ocean: they didn't start with enough fuel to make the full journey, and all the refueling spots have been used up by airplanes that got there faster. And when those who cross the Atlantic from Europe and Africa get to North and South America, they won't be able to refuel to cross the continent and the Pacific, because the residents of the Americas will have used all the available resources in their own attempts to head west. Similarly, if the attack continues for more than a day, those from the Americas arriving in Asia will find that they have no way of traversing the continent at the required speed. The only way to survive would be to be close enough to the poles to have considerably less distance to go, and on the ice caps, modes of transportation will be even more limited. And that solution only works if the attack stops after 24 hours -- if it's ongoing, those who survived by being close enough to the ice-caps to keep moving would starve. In other words, in your scenario, humanity would be screwed. What if they had time to plan and prepare? Well, I think we'd last a little longer, but not for long. There is no way around the fact that traveling around the globe in 24 hours, regardless of method, will require a LOT of fuel. We'd need to set up robotic fuel extraction, production, transportation, and refueling stations, so this work would continue while humans were elsewhere. This would also require global cooperation to be sustainable, and maintenance would be difficult. Ditto with food. Even if we have custom boats/planes/vehicles fitted with hydroponics labs, they will need a consistent supply of fertilizer in order to stay viable. So, even with time to prepare, humanity would be screwed. I'm just not able to come up with a way that your scenario would be survivable. If it lasted only 24 hours, then there might be a few dozen survivors near the poles, and a few thousand from the Americas stranded in Asia and Australia. Longer? Everybody's dead, Dave. 

This video shows many examples of "weird" behavior when a magnet encounters a copper plate, including braking and damping. $URL$ In this scenario, only the surface of the water experiences magnetic braking and damping. The larger globs of water have more mass-to-surface ratio and behaves more like regular water, but smaller drops might suspend longer in the air, and interact with other small globs to align into threads and filaments. The strongest ion field the foam is likely to encounter is the plasma "skin" of a larger body of water, hence the electrified foam will filament and float above a body of water for a second or two as it navigates through the water's ion field. If you want to push the electrical effect your foam might even have the occasional glow or electrical spark. 

Tongyiphobia is the fear of sameness. I found zero info online other than the word itself. Apeirophobia is the fear of eternity but is often used to mean a fear of infinite repetition, however a sufferer will counterintuitively make their lives as predictable as possible (probably a symptom of any phobia is to avoid unfamiliar situations that might lead to a triggering episode). Anticonformity is the urge to go against groupthink, while Reactance is a defense mechanism against feeling pressured to conform. The wiki link claims Reactance (when a test subject became more defiant after a disagreement) occurred in 8% of test subjects involved in a highly artificial scenario where a confederate is deliberately lying. Artificial conformity studies like the Asch Conformity Experiments are designed to test group compliance and the results are often overstated in pop psychology (not to mention test subjects are typically teenage college students not representative of general society). Milgram's Obedience Expiriments have been called into question for unscientific (loaded) situations where researchers badgered test subjects to comply. I doubt you will find any hard statistics on anti-conformity outside cultural opinion op-eds (for example comparing very generalized non-conformist behavior in the US vs China). Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is an anti-social behavior in children, but it seems to be more about disruption than anti-conformity. Some marketing folklore claims that customers will feel compelled to answer "yes" after saying "no" a number of times, typically after three or four "no" answers. I found a few articles boasting this claim online but nothing resembling legitimate research. It is probably just a management lie to encourage sellers to be persistent. 

All multi-cellular life as we know it is composed or eukarotic cells -- cells with a nucleus. Some single-celled organisms are eukarotic, some are prokaryotic (cells without a nucleus, such as bacteria.) Brief research indicates that prokaryotic multicellular life would be unlikely. But would some other form of non-eukarotic, but non-microscopic life be possible? If so, do we have any way of guessing what it's biochemestry might be like? 

It would make low-tech navigation immensely easier, which would likely result in more exploration / trade / conquest over wider areas happening sooner. The ring would give a clear east-west axis, and you could infer the north-south axis as perpendicular to it. You could infer latitude based on it's position and width. The most difficult part of low-tech navigation is longitude. If the ring were fully uniform, then it wouldn't help with that. But if there were any stable irregularities to use for reference, that would allow one to infer longitude as will. 

Since our Barber-Surgeon is so famous and successful he is designated the head of the guild. Naturally he brings his lovely wife (or possibly devoted housekeeper if she is so inclined) and she introduces the strange ideas of hand washing and hygiene to the training. Those who follow the strict rules have patients who heal better, and after a decade of professional resistance many doctors and patients accept there must be some "common sense" in hygiene, and the concept eventually spills over into other professions and sciences. 

Horses are graminivores meaning horses are grazers. Horses actually develop health problems if they don't eat enough raw fiber (hay, not oats), and their stomachs are relatively small. The Dwarves would have to maintain a large area of grassland to feed them because horses eat all day long, and they happen to be picky eaters. Based on typical Dwarf terrain, I'd expect goats (and maybe sheep). They are less picky eaters and love climbing on rock cliffs. For pulling carts and wagons, they would prefer donkeys which are stronger and smaller than horses. Donkeys are also independent thinkers, less skittish than horses, and will protect livestock from dogs and wolves. Overall the temperament of donkeys seems to align more with dwarves, and I could imagine dwarves considering donkeys the superior animal. Donkeys can also be saddled, but it is a different saddle from horses because their backs are a different shape (this might address some of the other answers involving a dwarf's difficulty in riding a horse). Ancient cavalries were like the jet fighters of their day, fantastically expensive and able to cover a long range in a short period of time, great for a surprise attack but they weren't the brunt of an army. Chariots are useless in the high mountains, and I suspect dwarves aren't exactly invaders or raiders (certainly not nomads), preferring instead to stay in their mountain kingdoms. They might keep a few horses as status wealth or possibly to stay in communication with other distant tribes or to increase the range of scouts on reconnaissance, but a full cavalry is probably just not their style. 

It wouldn't. Basically, this new world is exactly like ours, but the barrels of oil are smaller and a different color. Gold became used as a currency for the sole reason that it was rare and there wasn't much use for it (other than being pretty). You have removed both of those things by turning it into the oil substitute. In Earth-1, price of oil is all over the map, due to the supply, availability, demand, locations it's held in, et cetera. In Earth-2, the same thing would apply to Gold. Because of that, it would never be used as currency, just like we would never want the U$D going up & down in value depending on how much the Saudis and Russians drill. You can have economies "Based on" gold in Earth-2, similar to how the Saudi, Russian and Venezuelan economies are "based on" oil, but there is no 1-to-1 correlation between a certain amount of the commodity and their paper currency. The closest thing to describe this concept in Earth-1 terms is actually aluminum and grain. Aluminum - When it was "invented", it was difficult to produce, and thus was quite expensive, surpassing even gold in value. In the late 1880s, there was discovered a way to produce it cheaply... and suddenly the value plummeted. It wasn't rare anymore, thus it wasn't expensive. Napoleon III of France had a set of special aluminum diningware that was made for those guests so honored that gold simply would not do... and today I'm drinking soda out of a aluminum can, and tossing it in the garbage. Grain - Before there were fiat currencies, everything was based on barter... but many things were hard to just carry around. Barley, Rice, or Grain Farmers would deposit their grain in a silo, get a series of receipts and then exchange them for goods & services, and the recipients of those receipts could exchange them again for grain. Being grain (or whatever it was), it does go bad over time, so the receipts were dated and could "go bad" and become worthless. These "Grain Dollars" were highly localized based on the location of the grain storage silos, and while they could potentially be traded further away, there was a risk for anyone receiving that currency that the amount of grain would be worthless if they waited to long to retrieve. Obviously, this system only works in a diversified economy - if everyone grew grain, that system would be useless, because everyone is just growing money. It was also nearly impossible to build coffers via taxes, because any particular amount can be used up, or go bad, at any point. In your idea, Gold would be like grain... a commodity. Anyone can mine it, it has intrinsic value, and whoever mined it faster/cheaper could make a quicker buck than everyone else. 

The politics and purpose of your arco would significantly impact the number of residents that would be packed into it. In my mind, the default picture for arcos is the hippie utopian 1970s Arcosanti, and I immediately imagined a clean city with apartment balconies over a lake. Any ugly industry gets tucked away inside the dam and the residential population is limited by air/light exposure… No, wait. That is an architect pipedream.... An actual arco is going to be constructed for a purpose. It's a machine with a built-in power source. Industry would need the outside wall for venting CO2 or whatever byproduct it produces. It probably has a large industrial conveyor lift to bridge cargo from the lake above to the river below. The population is limited to only the required workers, managers, and their families. The people serve the machine, like an oil rig. The costs to provide for them will push the number of residents to a minimum.
