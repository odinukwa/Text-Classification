Take the chain apart from the bike, and clean it shaking inside a plastic container with a small amount of your preferred degreaser or solvent, replacing the solvent a few times untill it comes out clean. This can be made very cleanly (specially if you wrap the plastic container inside one or two old socks before shaking); Take the bike to somewhere else outside, where you can wash everything else with soap, water and a brush. A bit of degreaser first, on the drivetrain, might be needed. A hose would be very helpful. Dish detergent might be fine. Let the drivetrain as the last part to clean, so not to brush the whole bike with an already dirty/greased brush. 

There are a number of other alternatives. The main idea is to replace the quick-release skewers for some anti-theft ones, so the wheels (and maybe seatpost) don't need to be locked, only the bike frame. Hope this helps. 

(note the missing spoke at 2 o'clock...) This spiral configuration is achieved when the spokes you have are too long for a radial lacing. Then you twist enough that they can fit. This is not so good, because it creates torsion in the hub's body, but I've seen that (and ridden that) a lot, and nothing terrible happened so far. Of course, it could not be safely used with disk brakes. Now the good part: should the spoke run inwards (like the photo you posted and the photo I posted) or outwards? My answer would be: OUTWARDS, ALWAYS! I know that is pretty to see all those tiny spoke heads neatly arranged one beside the other in a pearl-collar-like pattern, BUT: 

At last, the frame should be compatible with longer forks. I've seen people installing double-crown, long travel forks in "regular" frames and go downhill, and eventually the head tube was torn off the bike due to excessive lever from the front wheel while braking and landing. Hope this helps! 

I would bet this is caused by a tire with rubber that got "old". This tends to happen to MTB tires that are repeatedly ridden on mud, and I had some tires with this behaviour before. The problem seems to be insuficcient friction between the rubber and the rim around the bead, specially on those tires with a material resembling fabric on that region (like it seems to be your case, judging by the first photo), and are worse on the front tire since it applies traction only while braking - the rotational force is always applied in the same direction. One measure to take, as already mentioned, is to put a higher pressure on the tire. It might allow you to get home without damaging a spare tube, but it's not the ideal solution since the slipping tendency is still there anyway, and sooner or later the tire ends up slipping, most probably when you don't expect. One other measure, that actually works very fine, is to "reactivate" the rubber on the groove where the rim and the tire "seat" against each other, considering that: 

If this is done thoroughly, I think it is perfectly possible to achieve, with no great expense and no great work, a level of precision more than anough to build a wheel within the relatively loose tolerance allowed by spoke/nipple thread lengths. I know this is not the answer for your question, but I think these considerations might be of your interest. Hope this helps! 

Although not having any statistics to bring up, I have experience carrying a kid with me (my stepson), mostly in a rear rack home-made "chair" (between 5 and 7 years old), with two test-rides in a trailing bike and lots of km on a tandem (last three years). I have no experience with kids smaller than 4 years old. I think some PRINCIPLES are valid for whatever child-carrying system, and these would be, in my opinion: 

I have recently assembled a bike from used parts, and the last bit of adjustment was precisely the stem length. Two criteria were key to decide the right length, and they didn't have anything to do with what I call "The Numerology of Bike Fit". Instead, I prefer functional criteria, that is: 

Rim walls are machined, if not for aesthetical or marketing reasons, to give the braking surface of rims most regular shape possible, removing small irregularities which could cause "hard spots" while braking, specially around the seam (spot where both ends of the rim are connected together during manufacturing). Also, it seems to me that the residual grooved pattern improves braking power, most probably due to increased contact surface and possibly dirt clearance issues, without noticeable increase in pad wear, but I have no objective data to support this impression except a positive personal experience with a handful of machined-wall rims with v-brakes. Hope this helps. 

First of all, I enjoyed the pragmatic approach to bike fitting, instead of a somewhat questionable numerology I've been seeing around lately. Also, the rationale starts from the problem up, and not from a canned solution down. Now let's go piece by piece, considering this one frameset: 

If the adjacent spokes with different tension are on the same side of the wheel, then you could, to a certain amount, release the tension from the tight one and tighten the loose one. If they are each on one side of the wheel, you could not even the tesion without untruing the wheel, and that means your rim is not intrinsically true. If the rim is not intrinsically true (that is, it would not look true if the spokes are removed), you could try to "bend" the rim in place this way: 

Gotcha! The fork is the original threaded one, and the ahead stem is mounted to a threadless-to-quill adapter. The end result is very firm and has quite acceptable looks. By the way, the fork is PERFECT because it is curved, sturdy, has fender eyelets and gives the frameset a very nice handling (not to mention the fact that frame and fork were designed for one another by a reputable manufacturer). 

With a bike with these features, you will always be able to upgrade to "modern" mountain bike components. 

From what you said - pedalling hard, chain almost worn out - it could be the worn chain working against worn cog teeth. I have a geared hub, and when I have this setup (worn drivetrain) it sometimes gives this grinding sensation, both by sound and by pedal feedback (tactile), because the chain rollers don'd disengage smoothly from cog's teeth. But sure I would also consider all of @Daniel R Hicks possibilities, specially a badly seated tube inside the tire. 

I had tires almost unusable because of this slipping problem, and the problem disappeared like magic after performing these steps. As an additional fact, any modifications I tried to make in the rim (cleaning, sanding, filing, grooving) had no effect. Hope this helps! 

For the third setting, you have to consider that SPD allows for some lateral play of the foot over the pedal. The position you pedal naturally MUST be the "midway" between each lateral-limiting position. Mind that human feet are not naturally parallel, the heel is a bit inwards and longitudinal lines of both feet describe an angle, which varies from person to person. Pedalling with your cleat "locked" against some of the limiting positions induces a terrible stress on the knee and the ankle. You should take a tool with you for a setup ride (usually 4mm allen), and keep setting up as many times you need until you feel comfortable. Olny tighten it fully after having found the right position, since the cleat bites the shoe sole permanently then. As for unease to clip and unclip, you'll get used to it, but you should start using the lowest spring preload that is enough to keep you cliped even when pulling the pedal up with the shoe. A minimal amount of oil on working surfaces might ease things in the beginning, but SPD pedals don't typically require constant lubrication. Hope this helps!
