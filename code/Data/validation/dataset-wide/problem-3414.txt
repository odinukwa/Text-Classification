This is a very common phenomenon, where a sound in a language can be spelled in multiple ways, or a certain spelling can have multiple pronunciations. To give a quick answer to your question: Written and spoken forms of a language can change independently. Let's start by looking at the two cases you mention: |x| and |c|, and we'll also look at silent |k|. We'll follow the convention of putting spellings between |vertical pipes| and putting pronunciations between /slashes/. |x| might as well be |ks| Why do we have |x| at all? Historical accident -- the letter |x| was used to spell /ks/ in Western Greek, then was borrowed by the Etruscans, then by the Romans, then by the Saxons. Usually when people borrow a writing system, they borrow the whole thing, even if it's not a perfect fit for their own language. |c| says either /k/ or /s/ Two questions come up here: Why does |c| have two sounds? Why do we have |c| in the first place? 

The English sentence "every man who owns a donkey beats it" can be interpreted as "every man beats every donkey that he owns", which makes no implication that anything exists. It is true even if there are no men, no donkeys, or no donkey slavery. This means a rigorous wording of this sentence uses only universal quantifiers ("for all" or "for each"): 

Perhaps this is why natural language processing is beating researchers' asses, so to speak: one has to capture the stereotypes associated with actors in a sentence in order to resolve this ambiguity. 

Many languages have a suffix (or some other alteration) that gives a pejorative meaning to a word. For example, in Spanish: 

Exact figures are always hard to come by, but here are the Non-Pama-Nyungan with the most speakers, as far as I can tell: 

There's an excellent article at Babelstone that explains this in great detail. (Kudos to @blunders for already mentioning it.) I'll try to summarize their findings. Characters show up in several different ways: 

It's due to social prestige. Let's look at a simple example from the history of English accents: changing "ng" to /n/ at the end of a word. Today, a word like "going" is pronounced with an /ŋ/ sound (a velar nasal) in a higher-prestige accent, yet with an /n/ sound "goin" in a lower-prestige accent. Pronouncing "ng" as /n/ is seen as less educated or less formal. In earlier times, pronouncing "going" as "goin" (with an /n/) was the mark of the English aristocracy. Pronouncing it with an /ŋ/ was more common among the lower classes.(See an article on Language Log for some information about this historical switch.) 

The Japanese letter ん represents a moraic /n̩/ sound, which always follows a vowel. Finally, it sounds like [ɴ], the uvular nasal, but elsewhere, its pronunciation assimilates to the following consonant's place of articulation. Wikipedia's article about the letter states that it "is followed by an apostrophe in some systems of transliteration whenever it precedes a vowel", in which case it is realized usually like [ũ͍] or sometimes [ĩ]. That article gives no examples of words containing n'. But off the top of my head, I remembered the name of the failed Shin'en space probe, which is four morae /si-n̩-e-n̩/. A bit more digging turned up the boy's name けんいち (Ken'ichi), consisting of four morae /ke-n̩-i-ti/. Draconis pointed out another in a comment: 恋愛 (れんあい, ren'ai), meaning "romantic love", is also four morae /re-n̩-a-i/. In each case, /n̩/ is a full mora but may belong to the previous full syllable depending on how your linguistics professor defines a syllable. See also the Japanese Language Stack Exchange question Difference between んい (n'i) and に (ni). 

the process of assigning a thing to a location (assignment? reference? indexing?) the thing that is assigned (referent?) the location that refers to the thing (pronoun? anaphor?) 

How exactly this change came about is actually rather interesting from a historical point of view. The suffix marking verbal nouns (like in "a building") was "-inge" in Middle English, while the suffix marking progressive participles (like in "I'm running") was "-inde". The two merged together in southern England in the 1300s, spreading slowly but never quite taking over the whole English-speaking world. 

Many languages disallow vowel-vowel sequences in a word or phrase, instead inserting an extra consonant between them to keep them apart. Some versions of English do this, like when Kennedy would say 

This also works with the slang interpretation of "beats it", with "x beats y" replaced with "x stimulates himself". Another user left a comment pointing out a third interpretation of the sentence, which I find less likely, that leaves at least some donkeys owned by richer men unabused: "every man who owns a donkey beats at least one donkey that he owns." This uses a third free variable: one for the man, a second to identify him as a donkey owner, and a third to identify a particular donkey as a beaten one. This third takes an existential quantifier. 

Let's look at each of these in turn. It's Actually a Language Proving that what you've discovered is actually a language isn't something that comes up often. Generally, when you've found that people somewhere are using some method of communicating, you can assume it's actually language. If you're not sure whether this method you've found is a full language or not, see if it can communicate any arbitrary meaning. If what you've found isn't a full language, you'll discover that it can't communicate any arbitrary meaning, just those few meanings that it's already equipped for. For example, if you're dealing with the beginnings of a trade pigin, you might find that it only has words for concepts related to trade, and that there's no way to say something like "My mother's foot is hurting.". Or if you're looking at a form of proto-writing, you might find that it only has a limited set of symbols that can't encode the whole spoken language of the community. But if what you're dealing with is a full language (in any medium), it will be able to communicate any concept. Some concepts might have to be explained at length, but the language will have the tools to be able to communicate them. It's Newly Discovered Proving that a language is newly-discovered is essentially the same as proving that no one else has ever documented it. All it takes is one example of someone else documenting it previously, and then you're not the discoverer. The easiest way to do this is to publish your findings on this new language, saying that you're unaware of any previous work on the subject. If others deserve credit for documenting this language before you, I imagine they'll speak up. But there's no sure way to prove that no one has documented the language before. There's no one worldwide repository of language documentation. You could be writing on some language in the Himalayas, only to find many years later some forgotten Russian journal from the 1800s with documentation of the same language. The best you can say is that as far as you know, you're the first person to actually document this language. 

"Would it make it harder to recognize where a word stops and where the next starts?" This is the problem of segmentation of an utterance into morphemes, the difference between "experts' exchange" and "expert sex change". Languages have a couple strategies to solve this, which apply whether or not a language has CV syllable structure. One strategy is to adopt predictable stress patterns. In Toki Pona, for instance, the first syllable of a word is always stressed, and the modifier in the phrase ends up carrying the phrase's primary stress. For example the phrase jan pona, which means "friend", behaves as a compound noun (/ˌjanˈpona/ which may realize in running speech as [ˌjɐmˈb̥ɔnɐ]) with pona "good" as its root. Stress in Spanish is not as completely predictable (and it's slightly less CV anyway), but the majority of words that end in a vowel are stressed on the penult (second to last) syllable. In a language with long vowels or geminate consonants, stress may fall a given number of morae, or length units smaller than a syllable, from the end of the word, as in Latin and Hawaiian. Another is to relax the stress constraints, but bias the lexicon against roots that contain the same sounds as common inflections or particles. For example, if two phrases supa yuza and su payuza invite confusion, people start rephrasing their utterances to avoid them. This is also fairly common and plausible, but it does result in occasional puns, as shown in the "Mondegreen" and "Pen Island" page on the literary analysis wiki All The Tropes. 

What non-Germanic languages were spoken ca. 500 BC to 500 AD in areas that speak Germanic languages today? How do we know? What traces do languages leave if they leave no descendants? 

In short, I'd say Khitan is probably the most like Kanji in its relationship to Chinese. Tangut seems more like Hangul: an independent writing system that, because of its place in the Chinese cultural sphere, was made to look more or less Chinese-ish. 

What do you call a suffix that gives an "anti-pejorative" meaning to a word? For example, imagine if you could do this:
