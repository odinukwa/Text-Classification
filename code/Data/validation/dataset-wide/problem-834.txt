He didn't need to know the absolute position of the stars. The change of the appearent position has been sufficient to get a good estimate. For velocites small in comparison to the speed of light, the shift of the angle is still small. For small angles the sine is proportional to the angle with 2nd order precision. The first Taylor summands are $$\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - + ... $$ The 2nd order approximation $$\sin x\approx x$$ can be applied on stars perpendicular, or at least apearently perpendicular, to the plane of the Earth orbit, where the method is most accurate. Hence the underlying reason, for which it works, is the smoothness of sine. This argument can be adjusted to less optimal conditions. 

The temperature in the heliosphere is about one million Kelvin, lower (but still very hot) in the outer regions of the heliosphere, higher close to the sun. But the density of the plasma is very low, so you wouldn't feel the heat (except close to the sun). Within Earth's exosphere, reaching up to 10,000 km, the temperature is lower, roughly 1,000 to 1,500 C. In interstellar space there exist hot (e.g. 10,000 K) and cold gas clouds. Due to the very low density, hot and cooler fractions can penetrate each other, such that there doesn't need to be a uniquely defined temperature. The large-scale average temperature of outer space should be 2.7 K (about -270.5 C), close to the CMB black body temperature. 

Think at the surface of a ball. A straight line within this curved surface is a great circle. Take some point on the ball. Draw two great circles (apparent straight lines in the surface) starting in this point, with some non-zero initial angle. The two apparent straight lines intersect at the opposite side of the ball. Wrongly assuming the surface of the ball being flat would result in the conclusion, that the lines must be curved. The same applies to our three-dimensional space. We intutively assume it as flat, such that two lines starting at an observer with some angle should never intersect elsewhere. But in some cases they do; so we intuitively think the lines must be curved. But according to general relativity, it's actually our space-time which is curved by masses. As an example, a ballistic curve looking like a parabola is actually a straight line in the curved space-time. So, two objects moving in different directions in e.g. Earth's orbit can eventually hit each other despite lack of drag or propulsion. They both move on a straight line (geodesic) in a curved space-time. The curved space-time allows these to lines to intersect later. Our three-dimensional Euclidean intuition interpretes this as curved trajectories. 

As you are suspecting, the sun burns in a different sense, not by chemical reaction with oxygen. Atoms consist of a tiny, heavy nucleus, surrounded by an almost empty space, populated by electrons. Burning by chemical reaction with oxygen doesn't change the nucleus of atoms, but takes place in the hull of atoms: Atoms may assemble to form molecules; electrons change their orbitals (the way they surround the nucleus), and release some energy as heat. Atomic nuclei are (positively) electrically charged, and repell each other. But if small nuclei, like those of hydrogen atoms, come close together, they can fuse and form a larger nucleus. This nuclear fusion of hydrogen to helium (in this case) releases much energy, more even than fission of uranium in a nuclear power plant. The notion "burning" is used sometimes for reactions of atomic nuclei, too, if they release energy as heat. To overcome the electrostatic repulsion of hydrogen nuclei, high pressure and temperature are needed. These conditions occur in the core of the Sun. 

During the galactic year of about 250 million years our solar system isn't orbiting on a Kepler ellipse around the galactic center, but instead oscillating up and down the galactic plane. 

Pluto is currently cooling down, since its distance from the Sun is increasing now, a few years after perihelion. That's seasonal. Mars has been suspected to warm up. But as far as I know, that's questioned in the meanwhile. 

The pointing is not a fundamental problem with the suggested design: The suggested trajectory is designed to include a Sun flyby as the last flyby. This ensures an asymptotically radial trajectory away from the sun after the flyby, hence maintaining the pointing relative to the sun. The proper motion of the observed object may be some challenge, but the trajectory could be adjusted appropriately by an additional burn. 114 dB are an amplification of a factor of about $2.51\cdot 10^{11}$. It doesn't refer just to the magnification, but to the intensity of the signal. Therefore interferometry with a long baseline isn't the same; the latter provides a high resolution. Whether those numbers are achievable in practice is a different question; a factor of 1000 for naturally occuring gravitational lenses would mostly be regarded as excellent. Theory allows arbitrary amplification for perfect alignment of observer, lense and observed object. Most of the distortions can be deconvoluted, revealing the field of gravity of the sun, and the shape of the observed object. Gravitational lensing is used today, here some lecture notes, and here quasars as an example. 

We wouldn't feel the ejection of another planet off the solar system, since the attractive force of distant planets to Earth is very low. Only close encounters of Earth with other planets would cause noticeable up to severe changes on Earth. This would be caused mainly by tidal forces due to different acceleration for different parts of Earth, or by changing the orbit of the Moon. A homogeneous acceleration wouldn't cause immediate damage, but with some delay it may cause temperature changes due to the change of Earth's orbit and the changing distance to the Sun. 

The universe expands with about 70 km/s per Mega parsec, due to Hubble's law. This means, that the velocity two objects move away from each other is proportional to their distance. At one Mega parsec it's 70 km/s. That's an average value, which doesn't need to hold for each single object. By dividing the speed of light of about 300,000 km/s by the Hubble constant, you get, that objects further away than about 4300 Mega parsecs move faster away from each other than the speed of light. The expansion is measured by the redshift of spectra, meaning absorption and emission lines are shifted. Together with distance estimates, based on several methods, the expansion per distance i.e. the Hubble constant, can be estimated. 

A piece of a white dwarf would explode, because atoms would expand to their normal size. This would hold for outer layers of a neutron star, too. For inner parts of the neutron star, that's not quite clear, but that kind of matter would probably decay rapidly, also resulting in an explosion. If the material of a neutron star could be kept stable, it would fall down to Earth's core, up to the other side of the Earth, and oscillate a while that way, before being slowed down by friction, and stopped close to Earth's center. (1 cm³ neutron star matter has a mass of about 400 million tons.) One cm³ white dwarf matter would have a mass of about 1 ton. Assumed it could be kept stable, solid rock could withstand this load. 

My ad-hoc opinion: This wouldn't be the first step of Venus exploration. Geologic in-situ investigation of the resurfacing hypotheses would already be a very challenging mission. Might be, one could find some metamorphic remnants which have survived the last resurfacing, and one could determine the age of rocks. Might be there exist some old layers below the surface, which haven't been molten up completely. Some kinds of crystals are more resistant to heat than others. They may also contain some records of more ancient epochs. Comparing their isotopic ratios might tells something about the ancient atmosphere, or at least about ancient geology. But conditions on the surface of Venus are very hard for probes. More feasible would be a detailed isotopic analysis of Venus' atmosphere, as e.g. proposed as VDAP mission concept, or by follow-up balloon missions. A submarine-like ballon diving into the hellish conditions of the lower atmosphere or even to the surface for a short period might be an approach. A TLS (tunable laser spectrometer) has been suggested to analyse the atmosphere. May be an additional mass spectrograph would be useful. If short dives close to the surface become feasible, cameras would make sense. A LIBS (laser induced breakdown spectroscope) would make sense only on direct contact with the surface due to the atmospheric absorption. APXS wouldn't probably work due to the heat, unless samples could be taken for analysis higher into the (cooler) atmosphere. IR spectroscopy could possibly work, if cooling can be achieved somehow (e.g. by insulation and adiabatic decompression). If surface samples can be taken during short surface contact, more ways to analyse rocks would become possible. The more instruments, the more weight, the larger the ballon, the larger the probe, the more expensive. But I'm far from elaborating technical or scientific proposals here for space agencies. Hence VDAP with a small TLS and a QMS (quadrupole mass spectrometer) - as already proposed by hugely experienced scientists - would be a good start.
