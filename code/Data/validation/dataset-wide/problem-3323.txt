The Polish name Mikołaj is held to correspond to the Nicholas family of given names, as evidenced by the Russified name of Mikołaj Kruszewski. As this is an odd sound change, my question is why? My first guess would be interference from Michał and other variants of Michael. 

and edit distance could provide a metric. Note that Double Metaphone, Soundex and its ilk are only heuristics, and grossly ignore orthography in order to obtain a rough representation. 

It has the connotation of impatience or exasperation which the regular imperative (formed with the bare verb) does not. Cantonese, like Mandarin, lacks tense-marking. 

A popular approach for language identification is to look at character n-grams: consecutive sequences of n characters from the text, and compare the resulting distribution with frequencies drawn from larger corpora of text from each of the candidate languages. Now, where do the empirical counts come from? Any representative text from the language will do. The University of Leipzig corpus consists of spidered web text for a large number of languages. The intuition is that particular character sequences are characteristic of particular languages: for example, Dutch text is likely to have in it, Italian text should have a decent frequency of , and so on. The distribution of character n-grams is like the signature of a language. This should be more robust than a dictionary-based method, particularly because a lot of short words are, just by chance, possibly going to occur in more than one language (e.g. , , ). For certain languages which have scripts that are not shared with other languages (e.g. Chinese, although some of its topolects have written forms too), simple heuristics should suffice. Japanese and Chinese can be distinguished by the presence or absence of kana. On the other hand, if the text is romanised, then the character-based method should work. This paper has a basic literature review and concentrates on the harder problem of language identification where the text is very short. 

Questions about grammatical gender abound on this forum and on other linguistics forums. It's well known that in general, grammatical gender need not coincide with natural gender. However, I am interested in whether there exist languages in which the grammatical gender of a given name appears not to coincide with the natural gender to which that name is generally assigned. I will exclude ambigeneric names and names belonging to non-human/neuter noun classes. The question is whether, in any languages you know of, a given name of feminine grammatical gender is used as a masculine given name, or vice versa. EDIT: I know of one case where this apparent constraint was strong enough that a Japanese female name ending in -o became a Latin first declension noun ending in -a, to avoid a conflict between grammatical and natural gender -- when Princess Michiko of the Chrysanthemum Throne visited Salamanca University! 

I have long wondered why, if the traditional translation is "(Though) the stars have changed, the mind (remains) the same", the structure of the motto emphasises the state of the stars (the concessive) rather than the mind (the consequent).1 I realise that the motto has the chiasmus structure ABBA. The Wikipedia article on chiasmus defines it as: 

I'm surprised that neither of the current answers makes reference to what exactly the Pinyin phonetically transcribes. The name of the city, romanised in Pinyin as kun1ming2, is pronounced [ku̯ən˥ miŋ˧˥]. As hippietrail correctly notes, there is a semi-vowel in medial position in the onset. hippietrail's transcription of 'kweeming' reflects the semi-vowel in the onset, plus the assimilation of the [n] in the first syllable to the following [m]. The reason for the confusion is that Pinyin rimes aren't meant to correspond directly to English orthography. This is why a Pinyin syllable like yuan is mispronounced by virtually every English speaker, where a correct transcription might be [yɛn]. In particular, there's a quirk of Pinyin regarding syllables with the nucleus [u̯ə]. In Pinyin, this diphthong is transcribed (, etc) except when the initial is zero, when it's transcribed . This quirk of Pinyin may be responsible for your question — perhaps its pronunciation would be less surprising if Kunming was instead transcribed , as would be the case if this quirk didn't exist! To sum up, you've encountered one of the quirks which make it hard for a naive English speaker to approximate Mandarin based on the Pinyin; although Pinyin uses Roman letters, the values diverge considerably. 

This is the natural language processing (NLP) task of named entity recognition. As you have observed, creating a bunch of heuristics will get you a long way, but not the whole way. Following modern trends in NLP, the best-performing approaches in this problem learn statistical models from data, rather than functioning off hand-written rules. An adequate statistical model will automatically learn some of the rules that you would otherwise have to define by hand, for example, "a word following a verb in title case is probably a name". The NLP group at Stanford has a state-of-the-art named entity recogniser based on conditional random fields (a machine learning technique). The models it includes are for the more general problem of recognising People, Locations and Organisations, but you can filter the output for People only. 

A sound change can only be "regular" with respect to a particular language. There are sound changes in languages which seem completely off the wall to me, but are "regular" in the sense that they are consistent with the diachronic evidence (i.e. the forms in a daughter language can be derived regularly from rules applied to a mother language). As such there is no list of "regular sound changes", where a sound change is somehow impossible if it is not in the list. As for the body of your question, [n] and [l] are said to be in free variation in Cantonese, which means that they are used interchangeably by native speakers, who consider both pronunciations acceptable. There are also some socio-linguistic factors involved — the [l] pronunciation is associated with female speech. [Incidentally, I personally say nei5 for 你 'you', but loeng4 instead of the "correct" noeng4 for the word 娘 'young girl'. This particular pair of pronunciations is very much in flux at the moment, and Cantonese may eventually shift largely to one pronunciation over time. Cantonese used to distinguish retroflex [ʂ] from apical [s] (e.g. 傷 shoeng1 'wound' vs 相 soeng1 'mutual'), but that distinction too has gradually been erased over the last 50-100 years.] An example of a quirky sound change, and I really do enjoy these, is from Taishanese, a Chinese topolect which, like Cantonese, is also spoken in Guangdong: 

As Atamiri says, a complete list is likely to be impossible. You are right in observing that most work in NLP is no longer based on hand-crafted rules but on statistics obtained from large amounts of data. However, projects which attempt to create hand-built broad-coverage grammars still exist: see the LinGO project by Dan Flickinger for an example of a broad-coverage English grammar. The term broad-coverage means that the grammar aims to include production rules that assign an analysis to as much English text as possible. Here's the list of production rules for this particular grammar. Another possibility is to extract production rules automatically from something like Penn Treebank. Those production rules, however, are quite sparse, since the Penn Treebank doesn't conform strictly to X-bar principles. 

The Swedish third person plural pronoun has the nominative case form de, which is pronounced /dɔm/. How did this situation come about? My guess is that the nominative merged with the accusative but somehow maintained its old orthographic form. 

Italian has centinaio and migliaio, which respectively mean "about a hundred; hundreds (pl.)" and "about a thousand; thousands (pl.)" in the approximate sense. However it's not a productive affix. The derivational process is a bit weird: noun (L. mille) -> adjective (L. milliarius) -> substantive adjective (back to a noun again). EDIT: There's also decina "about ten". 

Why, in the paradigm for Italian past participles ending in , does the regular past participle end in ? Whence the vowel, when the other two paradigms have and ? 

It says (vertically, top to bottom) 市川團十郎, which is the stage name of numerous generations of Kabuki actors. I'm not sure of the significance of the ぬ motif -- that's just a syllable from the hiragana syllabary with no clear independent meaning. The circle is an 円相, a brush-drawn circle which is meditated upon. The third object looks like a sickle, but again I'm not sure of its significance. 

The WALS (World Atlas of Language Structures) provides an account. The five values of the parameter in their analysis are: 

Why are English loanwords ending in /d/ or /t/ systematically transcribed into Hangul syllables ending in ㅅ rather than ㄷ? This seems strange, since when ㅅ is followed by a vowel, the coda is realised as [ɕ] or [s]. Also, there are native words ending in ㄷ, which would be a better phonetic match. Is there a principle explaining why ㅅ might be preferred? For instance, Internet is transcribed in South Korea as 인터넷, yielding the pronunciation [in.tʌ.ne.ɕi] when followed by the subject particle 이, or [in.tʌ.ne.sɨɭ] followed by the object particle 을. 

Try Double Metaphone. The idea behind it is to "hash" similar sounds to the same letters, putting words with similar orthography into an equivalence class. One application is in genealogy, where a historical surname might have dozens of realisations. Your examples would encode to: 

but does not elaborate on its stylistic effect. Is the motto sidere mens eadem mutato an instance of a chiasmus? If so, where is the focus understood to lie, or is parallelism the desired effect? And if not, what is the desired stylistic effect? 1 I understand that the motto can only be parsed this way. My question is about the stylistic intent of its word order. 

You could be referring to the aorist, or perhaps the "simple past" (passato remoto) that occurs in Italian which is sometimes used to place a distance between the actions described and the present context. Historical actions, or past narrative actions are often expressed in the passato remoto, which is the continuation of the Latin preterite. However the passato remoto is perfectly productive and is not limited to the third person or defective in any particular way. Neither is it obsolete in the modern language. 

The root is Latin iaciō (throw, cast), whose supine is iactum. Because of Latin ablaut (vowel change), prefixes like sub-, ob-, pro- trigger a vowel change to *-iectum. 

I will assume that by "translate" you mean which syllables in words loaned by Japanese correspond to [x] in their source language. The answer is that words containing [x] which come directly from languages with that phoneme are sometimes rendered ッハ hha. The most common examples would be Bach バッハ Bahha and Mach マッハ Mahha. Other times, it is simply rendered ハ (cf Zakharov Zaharofu, Halacha ハラーハー), or particularly word-finally, フ (cf Lech Wałęsa Refu Vawensa). Note that while ending not in /x/ but /h/, the Arabic name for God is sometimes transcribed as アッラーフ Arrafu. Words of Greek origin beginning in Greek with χ, however, tend to have that sound represented instead with syllables from the か行 (k- syllables), in line with English. Another subtlety is that the German orthographic ch which before high vowels is a palatal fricative [ç] and not a velar [x] is almost universally transcribed as ッヒ hhi, as in アルベリッヒ Aruberihhi for "Alberich". 

The key reason is that the "soft"/"hard" distinction is phonemic in Russian, but not in English. As such, the distinction is not rendered in phonemic (broad) IPA transcription. A narrow transcription may use the palatalisation diacritic ʲ. Indeed, as you've observed, palatalisation before front vowels in English is subject to idiolectal and dialectal variation. For example, I doubt that unconditional palatalisation before front vowels is present in my idiolect (Australian English). 

An example from an Australian Aboriginal language is Murriny-patha, which might be glossed as language good. Also referring to language families but not languages, we have examples like Langue d'oc vs Langue d'oïl (referring to the language groups' respective words for "yes"). 

This can be solved by chunking. NLTK has a rule-based chunker, and the Illinois NLP group has a statistical chunker written using their LBJ machine learning framework. 

There's a cave in Vietnam which has been newly opened to tourism called Hang Sơn Đoòng (English Wikipedia article here). My question is about the syllable in the name of the cave which is represented as . I didn't think the orthography allowed a nucleus written as , but it's there in the Vietnamese version of the page as well. Also, the only matches for that I can find are references to the cave. Is this a possible nucleus in Vietnamese orthography, and if so, what does it represent? 

They give examples of each type here. In their typology, Russian would be type 1 (with the preposition у "near" marking the possessor); Japanese would be type 2, since in boku no pen "my pen", the possessor and the possessed are related through a genitive construction. Standard English, French and Spanish would be type 5, although Gaelic-influenced English would have type 1 (The pen is at me) in a calque of the Gaelic construction. 

Yes, in the Combinatory Categorial Grammar, type-raising X->T/(T\X) yields trivially ambiguous derivations such as: 

The semantic extension goes like this: tribe -> explain to the tribe -> interpret. I expect the Hungarian case mentioned by @daf to have an analogous derivation. 

The rules for when whitespace is required/permitted in Korean are not obvious, but are not explicitly discussed in any grammars or textbooks I have access to. I can infer this much: 

The Zulu language does not capitalise noun class markers but capitalises the proper noun itself, as in the name of the language isiZulu (isi- is the singular noun class 7 marker). Also, in Irish Gaelic orthography, the mutations of capitalised nouns are not capitalised, for instance nGaillimh, the nasal mutation of Gaillimh 'Galway'. (As Colin Fine points out in a comment, Klingon perhaps, although the capitals in romanisation can distinguish different sounds, and unlike Gaelic and Zulu orthography, are nothing to do with the uppercasing convention for proper nouns :)
