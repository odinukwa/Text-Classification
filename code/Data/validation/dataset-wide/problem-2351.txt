This is in the category with swimming pools, and trampolines, and jungle gyms. There is no way to be completely safe and still have it fun. 

If you aren't drifting, then one item that would be useful is a log. This is as simple as a chunk of wood and a line. Time how long it takes for the log to reach the end of the line. This gives you a consistent idea of your speed at least relative to the parcel of water you are in. A stone on a string acts as a pendulum. This gives you a pretty consistent way to measure short periods of time. E.g. the amount of time for your log to to reach it's cord end. 

It doesn't have to be expensive. I have 5 drywick synthetic shirts now. Got them all at goodwill, paying about a buck more than a cotton tee would have been. One has a corporated logo, one has Carnival's logo. Nylon pants in the sports wear. I prefer to get unlined ones, as they are more versatile, but I have a couple pair with poly mesh lining that I use when working outside in winter. I got one goretex Sierra Designs jacket at Value Village for $8. The liner has failed somewhat. Not longer fully waterproof, but I use it when I doing errands on rainy days. 

I have traveled the back country for 4-6 weeks a year for 30 years, mostly in the Canadian rockies and on the pre-cambrian shield. I've never used water purification, nor did we generally in our group. We've had some cases of the runs over the years, but the spread out nature made it unlikely it was a water source that did it. Far more likely bad hygiene on part of the kids. Once on the Nechako we got started in the morning, continued to track upstream. Around the corner, not 100 yards upstream from our camp was a bloated cow on a gravel bar. Bossy was well past her Best Before date, and was likely winter kill left on the gravel by falling spring runoff. Despite having had diluted cow for the previous evening and breakfast, no one got sick. There are parts of the world where you have to be concerned about water. Not here. A large part of the risk comes from substantial exposure. E.g. If you get 6 bacteria, your immune system stomps all over them. If you get a dose of 6 million bacteria (About half a serving of active culture yogurt) AND if they are a variety that is toxic, you are in trouble. 

I think you did just fine. Key factors: You want the leather to be non flat, so the stone sits in in one place. This will get you far more consistent throws. You have in essence created the pocket by making the rim with the line. I think the common way is just to tie the line to the pocket material. You can make a better pocket by getting the leather soaking wet and stretching over a stone a bit larger than your usual throwing stone. Also: Put a pair of knots in the throwing string at the distance you hold it. This will allow you to get the strings the same length each time, which will also improve your consistency. One ancient people noted for slinging would put a piece of bread in a shrub or tree. Their kids had to knock it out of the tree to eat it. Also, few cultures have both slings and bows. Seem to be one or the other. I suspect that it's hard to get good with either. 

We live for a month at a time on the following type of diet. Weights are in pounds if unspecified. Breakfast: hot cereal 0.2 brown sugar 1 oz dried fruit 2 oz margarine .5 oz Lunch: 1 cup granola, or 2/3 cup trail mix (half nuts) 3 oz cheese, 1/3 tube stoned wheat thins, 1.5 oz peanut butter. 2 oz dried fruit. (We would normally have 2 lunches a day.) Supper: pasta 0.35 or rice 0.3 or beans, lentils, buckwheet 0.3 dried veggies (any of carrots, peas, turnips, onions, mushrooms, cabbage) 1-2 oz margarine 1 oz. dried soup mix as sauce. Spices. In cold weather double the margarine. This works out to about 3500 cal/day. 

If you are normal weight,then I would strongly suggest wearing whatever runners you wear day to day. 

Any amount of insulation helps. There are 3 main areas of heat loss. Head, sides of chest, and groin area. Any form of fabric will work. Yes, even cotton. (Cotton's problem is when it's in the air.) As an exercise try this: While wearing a life jacket in the water, remove your belt, then put it under your knees and around your neck so that your your knees are held close to your chest. Do this in a way that allows you to duck out of it without having to fumble with the buckle. Clamp your arms to your sides. This doesn't work well if you have short belt (small waist) compared to your height. Float like this for several minutes. Undo the belt and move. You will notice a rush of cold, as you dissipate the warm water near your body. Note: I did this experiment using a horse collar type life jacket, not the more modern vest type. Initial experiments should start with just hugging your knees to your chest to see that you float stably in that position. If you find your self on a Titanic replay, look for a garbage bag. Dress as warmly as you can, then bite holes in the two bottom corners and the middle of the bottom, and pull it over your head over the top of your life jacket. The holes will stretch open, but will be snug. Use your belt to fasten the bottom edge of the bag close to you, or tuck into your pants. If you can, tie the corners between your legs. Ideally drop your pants, tie between your legs, and pull your pants up. This slows the water exchange between your clothes and the sea. The water warms up some, and your survival time lengthens. A woollen hat with a bread bag over it also helps. 

I only wear hiking boots if there is significant off trail or heavy scree. The last dozen or so expeditions (1 week + trips ~50 lb pack) I did I mostly wore MEC reef boots, or divers boots, sized to allow medium weight work socks. The routes we did were mostly horse trails in Willmore Wilderness or in Rocky Clearwater Recreation Area (Alberta). With this combination, my feet were wet all day, but were warm. At camp I would change into dry socks and a pair of runners It was rare that we didn't have a stream crossing per hour. Waterproof boots do no good in knee deep water. The first few crossings, we'd wait while a few would take off their boots and socks, walk over barefoot, get their socks wet putting them on wet feet... Then they came to their senses, realized that the socks were getting wet anyway, and would charge on through. This combination doesn't work in snow. Feet get cold. It doesn't work if there is a lot of shale or slate on the trails. Boots get cut up. It's fine for rounded rock. It's not a good solution if you have weak ankles, but I find that wearing this sort of footwear trains a new set of reflexes. You are far more aware of your foot placement, and you just don't turn them as often. You walk very differently, with very little heal strike. You will feel every stone, every root on the trail. If you like going barefoot generally, you'll like this. Not recommended for city feet that have spent the month before the trip in city shoes. In passing I tried sandals. Bad idea. Stones, twigs, etc come in and park. 

If you can leave your crap there, you can leave the toilet paper too. Both will degrade fairly rapidly. Much of this is aesthetics rather than impact. No one wants to find tufts of toilet paper scattered about a portage landing, but the presence of the paper will have minimal impact on the local life forms. Crap: Depending on where you are, there are several ways that I consider acceptable: A: Buried in the active top soil, 50 meters away from nearest water. This can be as simple, as lifting a slab of moss, doing your business, and replacing the moss. Going a couple inches deeper is better form. Try to avoid making your personal pit in a runoff channel or hollow. More likely to have seepage into nearby water. B: Move a log or rock. Do your business. Put hte rock back. Talked to one ecologist who was working in a subalpine meadow. He advocated leaving a corner of your toilet paper to poke out from under the rock. By the time the paper disintegrates, the rock is ready for reuse. C: Smear your crap thinly on a large rock. This exposes it to bright sun which will destroy most of the microbial life. The sun rapidly dries the crap, and it gets redistributed by the wind. This method requires separate disposal of TP. Methods for getting rid of TP: A: Dispose of it with the crap. (All but C above) B: Carry a lighter. Burn the toilet paper, waiting until it is out completely. C: Bring back to the fire for disposal. 

Change shoes. Visit a physiotherapist, and take your current shoes -- both the ones you use on trips, and the ones you wear every day. A good physio can learn a lot from reading the wear patterns on your shoes. If you go to a doc, go to a sports doc. Call the coach at your local high school or college and ask who's good. Part of the problem is sudden shocks, Learn to keep a spring in your step going down hill. This will usually mean slowing down. One technique I've used is to take rapid, but very short steps. This doesn't work in big talus, or trails with lots of roots and holes. Land on a bent knee. In addition to the various stretches and strenthening routines, get ready for trips by going to your local skyscraper, large stadium or river valley park, and do stairs. Lots and lots of stairs. This is where you practices you bouncy springy stride. 

It's not that bad. First of all, distinguish between hypothermia and frostbite. The latter is when your flesh actually freezes. Water crystals do a lot of damage. It is extremely painful when thawing. If you get cold enough for numbness to set in, that too will be painful on warming. Hypothermia, not so much. First symptoms: The 'umbles: Stumble, Fumble, Mumble. Your fine motor coordination goes. Note: Mumbling may be just caused by cold cheeks and lips. Mumbling in this case is much more like someone who has had too much booze. Involuntary shivering. If you can force yourself to stop with an act of will, you are still ok. In danger, but ok. Sometime in here you stop being rational. Once you stop shivering you are in big trouble. Muscles are too cold to work, which means they have stopped generating much heat. Your body temp drops really fast now. Consciousness fades. As your core cools, heartbeat gets irregular, your lungs start filling (pulmonary edema) and death results. The shivering phase is unpleasant, but not painful. Note that in my outdoor experience I've seen mild to moderate (uncontrolable shivering) on several occasions. The symptoms do not always show up in the same order. Sometimes this may be that no one (including the victim) noticed. Sometimes they just don't happen that way. Some may be the complications of low blood sugar, dehydration, exhaustion. Note that hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) will also show the 'umbles and the irrationality. Dehydration also has similar onset. Both make hypothermia more likely, the first because there is less fuel to create heat, the second because the circulation system is sluggish and can't move glucose, O2, and heat around as effectively. In all three cases treatment for early stages: sugar and hot drinks, For hypothermia: dry/more clothing, shelter from wind, more movement if conscious. It does NOT have to be below freezing to die from hypothermia. You can die of hypothermia in 70 degree water. Takes hours. In 50 degree water far less. In 35 degree water you aren't able to do much for yourself after about 20 minutes. Unconsciousness is another 20 minutes or so. For non-water sports, the dangerous temps are around freezing. It's hard to stay dry at those temps. But being immobile on mountain ridge at 50 F in a storm can kill you with hypothermia. Wind makes it worse. It keeps moving the warm air next to your skin away. Wet makes it worse. Water evaporates and cools. It also reduces the effectiveness of insulation. The combination is deadly. Small people (children, women) are more susceptible than larger. Skinny people are more susceptible than fat people. In both cases, the core is closer to the surface. If you get to the cesation of shivering, you have a life threatening situation. If you are far from help the victim is very likely to die. Don't let it get that far. 

Over most of your body your system can restrict blood flow to the skin, cooling the skin (and making you feel cold) Locations where bloodvessels run close to skin big sources of heat loss. Parts of your body that have sub-cutaneous fat lose heat more slowly. Wehre there is little fat (sides of the chest, under the arms) heat loss is more rapid. The head has no auto-regulation for heat, and receives about 25% of your blood supply. If you were standing naked, then initially some fairly large percentage (the head isn't 25% by area, so it will be under 25%) will come off your head. As your body realizes, "hey, it's cold out here" surface circulation will be reduced. Later even main flows to limbs will be reduced. Muscles get stiff. Fingers get inept at doing up zippers and buttons. (Fumbles) You are now in trouble. Further chilling will result in cooler blood going to the brain. Large muscle coordination gets erratic (Stumbles) Judgement starts to go, and speaking is impaired (mumbles) Note that the 'umbles are also characteristic of low blood sugar. Eat. But backing up, as you cover up, what heat losses there are come from the parts that are still uncovered. So yes, if you are wearing winter boots, good mitts, pants over fleece and a storm parka, then, yes your head is likely to be some very high percentage of your heat loss. Prevention: Stay cool to stay dry. Open up when you even start to sweat. If your hands get cold put on your hat. If your still cold, put up your hood. If you start to shiver, your body metabolism is falling behind. Reduce the heat loss. Get out of the wind, get more clothes on. Change wet or sweat soaked clothes for dry ones. You need to fuel that shivering. Eat. Drink. Hot sweet liquids are best. Dehydration interferes with metabolism. Prevent dehydration. Eat snow if you must.. If you aren't already cold it won't hurt you. The energy of half a snickers will melt a kilogram of snow into water. (The ice crystals however will scrape your throat raw) One trick I use on winter trips is to bring a thermos of triple strength juice at as close to boiling as I can. Fill the cup 1/3 full and pack snow into it until it doesn't melt. One liter in the back becomes 2-3 liters in the field. 

GPS's are subject to 'jitter' The GPS signal has several sources of error. Jitter, under good conditions is fairly constant around 2 meters. There is a longer term error of about 7 meters that is more broad scale. WAIS will counteract this one. It has a much slower time fluctuation so it will not affect your distance much The slower you go, the greater the error will be. Consider: If your GPS does a position every 2 seconds, and in that 2 seconds you move 2 meters (about 6 feet, or 3 ft/sec or 2 mph) and that error is 2 meters in an arbitrary direction, then in those 2 seconds it can record a change anywhere from 0 to 4 meters, with an average of 2.8 meters. As you drive away at 30 m/sec the error is a much smaller component of your velocity. If you want to get decent numbers off of your tracks, use a map application such as OziExplorer, and plot your route. Now smooth out your breadcrumbs. With reasonable care you can get accuracy to within a few percent. You can practice this by doing routes with known distances.
