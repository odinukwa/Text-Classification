If I'm obtaining drinking water by melting snow or ice with a stove, what strategy will minimise fuel consumption? For example, I have read that I will want some starter water and plenty of fuel. That makes sense from a heat transfer point of view, but how does the amount of starter water depend on how much snow or ice I need to melt? Is it enough to cover the bottom of my pan, or do I want the snow/ice to be completely floating in water? And when all has molten, how much water do I keep in my pan and how much do I pour into my water container, before I add additional snow to melt, considering that snow has a much lower density than liquid water? 

Nuortakrågge is located at 67.8084°N, 16.6203°E, above Vuodnabahta, Norway. It is open and free to use. It is not listed on official maps but there is a small sign along the main trail from Vuodnabahta to the Swedish border. Some entries in the visitor book mentioned Maskåsj-gammen on the Swedish side of the border. Måskåsj-gammen is not on any maps either, and there is no sign pointing there along the trail from the border to Vásjáluokta. I asked local Sami people on the boat from Vuodnabahta to Ájluokta, who gave me a description that wasn't very useful (something like "turn left a bit after the 5th stream crossing, but there is no trail"), and pointed out that all the names on the map are wrong (and they don't use the maps because they know the way). I found a blogpost with a photo: 

If you're lost in the wilderness (and you've foolishly left behind your handy dandy water purification tablets and water filter), what are some of the best and safest ways to purify water? What do you do if you don't have a metal pot to boil water in? 

The main reason people usually share best practices orally and in person is because the experienced climber can correct the mistakes the student will make. No matter how good you are at reading, translating potentially life or death skills from a page to the rock wall is no sure thing. Some things can be learned by reading, but it will only take the smallest mistake to kill you or someone you're climbing with. Use resources like the above with a big grain of salt. 

This is what I've found in the wonderful world of the internets: $URL$ Personal experience living in the USA for 22 years says that there are more issues with thorn bushes than with stinging nettles. Most poisonous plants I've run into are low to the ground. If you wear pants (and are not extremely sensitive), you're almost always fine. Also, on a side note: most hiking trails are poison-ivy free, as long as you stay on the trail and don't wander off. Unless you particularly enjoy brushing your ankles along the greenery, the hiking trails should keep you pretty safe. 

This sounds like a macabre version of one of those teambuilding exercises. As noted above, your emotions will be going haywire and you won't think clearly. You'll probably stay with your fallen friend for some time before you get your thoughts in order. 

I use a very nice pair of 15x50 image stabilised binoculars for birding/wildlife. Yes, they're pretty heavy but when I can stand next to a birder with a dedicated spotting scope and see things that he can't, I'm pretty happy with myself. It's also pretty good for aviation and for casual star-gazing. The image stabilisation doesn't seem to affect image quality in any significant way. Heavy and expensive though. 

At the risk of suggesting the obvious here: 1) Rig up an internal hoop. Use a spare of one of the external hoops and cut a few inches off to fit. Pad the ends, and Velcro the ends and top to the inside of the tent. 2) Put a few more guy-ropes on the end hoops to encourage some more lateral tension. Second option should be the easiest one to try. 

Because roads are harder than hooves, and whatever is harder usually wears down whatever is softer. It's also pretty good protection against chipping/splitting that the horse may get from stepping on rocks. 

If your friend is undoubtedly dead, then your own safety becomes paramount. If you can't safely get to the body, then you can only leave it in situ until you get the authorities there (by whatever means). In the unlikely event the body is in the open and readily to hand, then practically speaking, protecting the dignity of your friend (and family) is most important. If you have no means of contacting the authorities from where you are and have to travel some distance to gain help/communication: 

So it looks like that in 2010, there were indeed some sections with considerable snowpack, althoug lower foothills were snowfree. If this information can be trusted, that is; it does look like the resolution is rather poor. The map above has snow in valleys but not on glaciers, so I guess it needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Therefore my question is: What are suitable areas for hiking in Eastern California around 10–20 May, if any? 

There are also excellent hiking books that describe hikes along with their difficulty. Even if the description may take some work to decipher (although with a dictionary and some time you should be able to), the route sketches, estimate for duration and difficulty can be quite helpful. I recommend På tur i Lofoten which contains a whopping 193 descriptions of hikes, anything from a short 1 hour stroll to an arduous 8 hour scramble. You can order this book directly from Lofoten Turlag, or ask them where you can buy it locally. 

Although the train is not a typical mode of transportation in North America, is it quite suitable for an outdoor vacation in combination with car rental. You're not limited much in the amount or type of stuff to take, you get to experience the distance and see the country, and you can get closer to most national parks than by air. Compared to driving, it saves time, because the train continues day and night. We took a train from Toronto, Ontario to Salinas, California, then a bus to Monterey. From there we had a one-way car rental to Los Angeles, camping at the Big Sur and at Channel Islands National Park on the way (possibly the most underrated national park in the USA; see above). Then we took a train from Los Angeles to El Paso, from where we had a one-way car rental to San Antonio, while visiting White Sands National Monument, Carlsbad Caverns National Park, and Big Bend National Park (we could have camped there, but it was winter and we decided to take a cabin, which was for the best because it turned out a serious winter storm was coming). From San Antonio we took the train back to the Great Lakes area. It was a very memorable vacation and we did not enter an aeroplane once. 

I'm in the slow process of acquiring all of the gear I think I will need to do a week-long backpacking trip somewhere in the Midwest. Many of the more experienced backpackers I've spoken with or read about say that you should test your gear out before you take it on the trail. I want to test out my setup without breaking it, and hopefully without taking up too much of my time. What do you recommend as a thorough yet reasonable test for a backpacking setup? I want to develop a backpacking and camping routine with my portable gear but don't have much experience with anything other than car camping. What are your tips and tricks for backpacking success? EDIT: The gear I have that I would like to test out includes (but is not limited to) the following: Gregory Baltoro Backpack, sleeping bag, tent, stove, water filter, first aid kit, knife, machete (possibly not included), water bottles, and a cheap, bulky sleeping bag pad. I suppose I probably need to assemble a mess kit, acquire cooking supplies, and select clothing before I'll be able to do a full test run. 

Once you make it to step four, you can follow most any guide to wilderness survival and reacting to being lost. The first three steps, however, are those that I would prioritize as the most important. 

Let's imagine for a moment that you're solo hiking somewhere you've never been before and take a fall off the edge of a trail, injure yourself (to the point of limited mobility), and become entirely disoriented. Obviously, this is a scenario that could be avoided with proper planning and better practices. The best solutions would have been preemptive. Regardless, this scenario is where my question is to be asked from. You're alone, injured with limited mobility, and lost. Assuming a normal load out (normal clothing, some water, a knife, etc.), what do you do to survive and make it back to a safe place? What are your priorities, and what is your course of action? 

Get out. You can quickly cool down when it's raining out, in particular when the rain is horizontal and it's 4°C outside. You say there's no shelter anywhere near. Then walk as fast as you can to somewhere not near. I infer yours must be a day trip, for surely you're not out on a multi-night backpacking trip in a cold & wet climate without any raingear or night shelter. Locate the closest shelter, be it a bus stop, a pub, your car, or even a house if you trust strangers and they trust you. Even if they don't invite you in, you might hide under a ledge. Walk to such shelter as fast as you reasonably can, be it one, two, or three hours march. The wet-cold spiral is real and bad for you. 

Red-white-red markings below the Scatta Minoia, between Alpe Devero and Pomatt, near Domodossola, Italy. It is my impression that in Italy one sees whatever the painters felt like (I've seen white-red, white-red-white, red-white-red, and other variants). 

I am considering a trek in August/September in the Mealy Mountains and English Mountains in Labrador (Canada's newest National Park; for info see 1, 2, 3). However, I am worried by the prospect of polar bears, so I wonder how frequent they are. I have two data points: 

Spain is mediocre when it comes to topographic maps. Certainly beats Italy, but you won't find the quality of France, Switzerland, Germany, or northern Europe. They're not too old — you can find maps less than 10 years old in the new digital series, at scales down to 1:25,000. In general, what's on the map exists and is accurate. Unfortunately: most hiking trails are missing. They can be hard to get outside Spain, but can be ordered online and shipped abroad (at least inside the EU). We order them directly from Spain. There are a number of stores selling them, googling for tienda mapas topograficos may help. For example, see Tienda Verde. It helps if you know some Spanish and phone the store directly, for some stores may simply ignore your e-mail if you write them in English. Even passing your e-mail through Google Translate improves the probability of success. For hiking trails, you need to complement the maps with either: 

I think the reason for this difference in slipperiness is purely a factor of surface material. Most foam pads have a tacky surface finish. Inflatable pads, on the other hand, usually have a sturdy synthetic fabric as the surface. Fabric on fabric (sleeping bag on inflatable pad) will stick less than fabric on foam, unless the fabrics have been treated somehow. This is a legitimate effect to notice. I'm sure that somewhere on the internet you can find a coated inflatable sleeping pad, however the gain of friction on your pad will then come at the cost of additional weight. 

Bug Spray: Unless you're backpacking in and are extremely weight conscious of how much you're carrying, if you think you might need bug spray, why wouldn't you bring it? Better to have it and not need it then the other way around. How to stay cool when climbing: Wake up early and climb from sunrise until it gets hot. Then, take a break through the heat of the afternoon and start climbing again in the early evening. Hydrate often and hydrate a lot. Sweating will keep you cool up until you hit dehydration (to a point of course). Dehydration is not a fun thing to pair with climbing or the great outdoors. General Tips: Make sure a couple of your friends and family members know where you are on this trip and when to expect you back. Have a backup plan in place in case one of you is injured bouldering (how will you get home with a sprained ankle or broken wrist?). Also, if you plan on trying some really challenging problems, I would recommend bringing a crash pad with you. It could save you some pretty hard landings and let you climb more difficult routes in a much safer way. Biggest Tip: Bring someone with you who knows the area. Having a resident pro can be invaluable. 

Pine Martens aren't native to the Lake District as yet - you need to go further north to find them (and then in small numbers). This will most likely be one the more common mustelids - Stoats will happily (and greedily) take rabbits, which I believe are your bones. Without a photo/dimensions of the scat, I have to offer the most likely answer here. And yes, the Stoat looks small compared with the Rabbit, but it's fully capable of dragging it's prize many metres to a feeding spot. 

A couple of factors from my own experience are: Pronation - I over-pronate slightly, so the outside of my heel gets worn down more quickly than the inside. When it wears past a certain point, I find myself rolling my ankle more than usual and end up buying new boots. Sole material - The softness of the sole material has a large impact on the longevity. Soft "comfort" soles of course wear out a lot faster than harder soles. This of course is why running shoes wear out quickly. Of course, the downside is that harder soles can be a little less comfortable, but that's something you'll need to weigh up for yourself. I'd agree that 300 miles (30 decent walks) are on the low end of what you'd expect. I'd advise you to take a good look over your worn-out boots and identify where they've worn out the most, then buy something that addresses those points. Or take an old pair into a reputable store and ask for guidance.
