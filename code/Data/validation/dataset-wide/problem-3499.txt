Stigler and Becker's argument is methodological, not philosophical. They do not try to convince us that preferences are indeed identical across individuals and invariant across time as a matter of reality (the "Rocky Mountains" metaphor is an "as if " approach). Their point is that any outcome can be rationalized by assuming that "it was preferences that made it so", since "De Gustibus Non Est Disputandum", and also they are unobservable. But then, we could "explain everything" in this way, and so explain nothing. Their goal is to defend in terms of useful modelling the other extreme: assume immovable preferences and try to find explanations for the observed outcomes based on observable, quantifiable concepts, like prices. I believe the following passage from the first page of the paper summarizes the approach 

There is not a single answer, it will depend on the particulars of each problem. Let's look at a standard example. Consider the benchmark intertemporal optimization problem for the Ramsey model $$\begin{align} &\max_u \int^{\infty}_0{e^{-\rho t}u(c)dt}\\ \\ & \text{s.t.}\;\; \dot{k} = i-\delta k\\ & \text{s.t.}\;\; y = f(k)=c+i \end{align}$$ The current value Hamiltonian is $$\tilde H = u(c) +\lambda [f(k)-c-\delta k]$$ Maximizing over $c$ alone we have $$\frac {\partial \tilde H}{\partial c} = u'(c) - \lambda =0 \implies u'(c^*) = \lambda \implies c^* = (u')^{-1}(\lambda)$$ and the 2nd-order condition will hold if the utility function is concave, $$\frac {\partial^2 H}{\partial c^2} = u''(c^*) < 0$$ Moreover, from the first-order condition with respect to consumption, $\lambda >0$ if local non-satiation holds. Assume that we do have such "usual" preferences. The maximized over consumption Hamiltonian is $$\tilde H^0 = u[(u')^{-1}(\lambda)]+\lambda [f(k)-(u')^{-1}(\lambda)-\delta k]$$ The partial derivatives with respect to the state variable, $k$ are $$\frac {\partial \tilde H^0}{\partial k} = \lambda[f'(k) - \delta], \;\;\;\; \frac {\partial^2 \tilde H^0}{\partial k^2} = \lambda f''(k)$$ So here, the Arrow-Kurz sufficiency condition boils down to whether the marginal product of capital is decreasing, constant, or increasing (which will depend on the sign of the second derivative of the production function). In the standard case $f''(k) < 0$ and we have the sufficient condition. In the most famous case of deviation, Romer's $AK$ model that initiated the Endogenous Growth literature, $f''(k) =0$, and the marginal product of capital is a positive constant. So what can we say in this case? Here, Seierstad, A., & Sydsaeter, K. (1977). Sufficient conditions in optimal control theory. International Economic Review, 367-391. provide various results that can help us. In particular, they prove that if the Hamiltonian is jointly concave in $c$ and $k$, it is a sufficient condition for a maximum. The Hessian of the Hamiltonian is (we can ignore the discount term) $${\rm He}_H = \left [ \begin{matrix} u''(c) & 0\\ 0 & \lambda f''(k)\\ \end{matrix} \right]$$ In the standard case with $u''(c) <0, \; f''(k) <0$ this is a negative definite matrix and so the Hamiltonian is jointly strictly concave in $c$ and $k$. When $f''(k) =0$, checking that the matrix is negative-semidefinite is straightforward using the definition. Consider a vector $\mathbf z = (z_1, z_2)^T \in \mathbb R^2$ and the product $$\mathbf z^T{\rm He}_H\mathbf z = z_1^2u''(c) \leq 0$$ this weak inequality holds $\forall \mathbf z \in \mathbb R^2$, and so the Hessian is jointly concave in $c$ and $k$. So in the $AK$ model of endogenous growth, the solution is indeed a maximum (subject to the parameter constraints needed for the problem to be well-defined of course). 

Economists (most of them) build their models assuming most of the time stochastic dynamic equilibrium. So Economics does not contrast "dynamic" with "equilibrium" - it synthesizes them. It is stochastic in the sense that random shocks are acknowledged. It is dynamic in the sense that it may revolve around a deterministic or stochastic trend. And it is an equilibrium because, exactly, it is assumed "chained" -not necessarily to some level but at least to some trend. The "bias induced" here, the price to pay, is that mainstream economic models are not very good at predicting derailment and crises. On this, perhaps it would be useful to read this column article by well-known economist Robert Lucas. 

It is my impression that it is "bean-bricks" and it is not a book but a paper/essay under the title "The long-range economic effects of automation", which was included in the book HERBERT, A. S. (1965). The Shape of Automation for Men and Management. Go to the on-line digital library of Carnegie Mellon University and enter in the search "The Economic Effects of Automation" (without the "long-range" part). It (freely) downloads what appears to be a first version of the work (20 pages). The file may appear to not be a .pdf one, but I opened it with .pdf software alright. At the end of page 9 Simon writes: 

In an intertemporal maximization problem, we seek to find the optimal sequence of the control and the state variables. It is the recursive nature of the problem that permits us to consider a "typical" point in time and just one condition per variable. For each such problem, we need to find out (carefully) in how many distinct periods a specific realization of a variable appears. To do this properly we should distinguish between the "absolute" index, and a "running" index. In the formulation of the Lagrangean as appears in the question, this is not done (and it is usual practice not to, but it may become confusing). So I would use the $t$ symbol as the absolute index (to arrive at same-looking first-order conditions), and some other symbol for the running index, say $$\mathcal{L_t} = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \beta^{j}\left\{u(c_{t+j}) + \lambda_{t+j} \left[ f(k_{t+j}) + (1 - \delta)k_{t+j} - c_{t+j} - k_{t+j+1}\right]\right\} $$ Note that $t$ no longer affects the discount factor $\beta$, and this is because the discount factor has to do with looking at the future, which is represented by the index $j$. Also, note that $j$ starts at zero, indicating that the first period is the $t$ period. Written this way, the Lagrangean says "we are at some point in time indicated by $t$ (that can take the value zero or whatever positive value), and we are looking forward period by period counted by index $j$". For any given $j$ we have $$\mathcal{L}_t =...+ \beta^{j}\Big\{u(c_{t+j}) + \lambda_{t+j} \left[ f(k_{t+j}) + (1 - \delta)k_{t+j} - c_{t+j} - k_{t+j+1}\right]\Big\} + \beta^{j+1}\Big\{u(c_{t+j+1}) + \lambda_{t+j+1} \left[ f(k_{t+j+1}) + (1 - \delta)k_{t+j+1} - c_{t+j+1} - k_{t+j+2}\right]\Big\} + ...$$ Pondering this, we realize that the variable $k_{t+j+1}$ will appear in only two consecutive periods, and so the first order condition for a "typical" element of the sequence $\{k_{t+j}\}_{j=0}^{\infty}$ can be exrpessed by differentiating only these two periods with respect to $k_{t+j+1}$. Doing so we get $$\frac {\partial \mathcal{L}_t}{\partial k_{t+j+1}} = -\beta^{j} \lambda_{t+j} + \beta^{j+1}\Big\{ \lambda_{t+j+1} \left[ f'(k_{t+j+1}) + (1 - \delta)\right]\Big\} $$ Take common factors (which will simplify the discount factor) and set equal to zero $$\frac {\partial \mathcal{L}_t}{\partial k_{t+j+1}} = \beta^{j} \Big[-\lambda_{t+j} + \beta\Big\{ \lambda_{t+j+1} \left[ f'(k_{t+j+1}) + (1 - \delta)\right]\Big\}\Big] = 0$$ To lighten the indexing burden, we can express this for $j=0$, to obtain $$\frac {\partial \mathcal{L}_t}{\partial k_{t+1}} = 0 \implies -\lambda_{t} + \beta\Big\{ \lambda_{t+1} \left[ f'(k_{t+1}) + (1 - \delta)\right]\Big\} = 0$$ 

There is a confusion between a "linear relationship between two variables" and an "econometric equation that is linear in the unknown parameters to be estimated". The first has to do with what happens in reality, and it implies that the marginal relation is constant. The second may be obtained even if the actual relation is not linear, but non-linear in specific ways that permit to obtain it by a suitable transformation of the data. To illustrate this, for the OP's case, the actual (deterministic part of the) relation may be $$X_d = AR^aP^{-b} \tag{1}$$ Demand $X_d$ for the product is a positive non-linear function of social ratings $R$ and a negative non-linear function of its own price $P$. The marginal effect of price for this relation is not-constant $$ \frac {\partial X_d}{\partial P} = -\frac{b}{P}X_d <0$$ By assuming $(1)$ we have already made a series of assumptions about the interplay of the variables involved. This specification permits us to obtain "an econometric equation that is linear in the unknown parameters to be estimated" since by taking logs we have $$\ln X_d =\ln A +a\ln R +(-b)\ln P \tag{2}$$ So while the marginal effect of price on demand is not linear and not constant, the elasticity of demand with respect to price is constant, and equal to $-b$ (the sign indicating direction of influence). But is $(1)$ an adequate way to represent the actual relation? So the proper way to proceed here is to 1) To the best of our knowledge, using evidence and logical arguments, we determine the qualitative interrelations between the variables involved: is the effect positive/negative? Is the relation of their levels linear/non-linear? Is it monotonic or, say "inverted-U", etc. 2) We construct a mathematical form that reflects qualitatively the conclusions/assumptions arrived at in step 1. For example, if we believe that an "inverted-U" relationship exists between levels of $Y$ and $Z$, this could be modeled by $Y = a + bZ + cZ^2$ with $c<0$ 3) If the mathematical expression we obtain in step 2 is not linear in the unknown parameters of interest, we check whether it can be transformed into one that it is. Of course, there are estimation methods for non-linear relationships, non-linear least-squares being the easy example. But experience has taught us that our estimation techniques are better when they estimate equations linear in the unknown parameters, this is why we always try to arrive at such a specification, even if we may accept in the process certain approximating steps to what we have obtained in step 2 (and not just exact transformations). 

A distinction must be made between the individual demand curve and the aggregate demand curve. An individual demand curve (or demand schedule) for a product/service, represents the pairs {price, quantity demanded} that co-optimize the consumer's utility maximization problem (together with all other quantities demanded of the other products that are present in the utility function). It may appear that then this would be the "maximum" price, but it would be confusing to characterize it like that. Because, if the price changes, what would happen to individual quantity demanded depends on whether the good is normal or not, and in general whether there are "income-effects" or not (not all utility functions allow for income effects, by the way). Moreover, at the individual level, the concept representing the consumer is quantity demanded, not price: the consumer observes prices and responds with quantity demanded. Let's move now to the aggregate demand curve. It is simply the sum of individual demand curves for each price. Here we have two alternative approaches: a) The more "traditional" one is that all consumers have a non-zero demand schedule for all price levels, each lowering its demand as price increases. Here the previous discussion applies. b) The alternative but equally "standard" approach is to argue that for each consumer there exists a (possibly different) "threshold" price, above which the individual demands zero quantity. So as price decreases, we imagine that more consumers enter the market with non-zero demand, and this is why as price decreases aggregate quantity demanded increases. This approach implies that the price level in each price/quantity combination is the minimum ("at least") price for some consumers, while others would be willing to pay more (and so they have contributed positive quantity demanded for higher price levels). I believe this is the approach taken by the textbook.
