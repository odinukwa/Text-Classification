I would submit the Swedish general election of 1968, where the Social democratic party achieved 50,1 % of the (raw) votes, with a voter turnout of almost 90 % (they had achieved even more in 1940, but then war conditions made for some small infractions against the communist party and a lower turnout than usual). As for referendums, I would cite the Norway referendum for approving the dissolution of the union with Sweden in 1905, but there were less than the required 500 000 voters, and women had no suffrage. Still, it achieved an impressive 99,95 % approval. 

This is a little bit of a stretch, as one was granted the title, but never gained control of the country, but five of the sons of Thorfinn Skull-splitter were Jarls of the Orkneys, which was more or less independent: 

Niels was followed by Erik Emune, bastard child of Eric Evergood. Later, his bastard son Sweyn Grathe would also take the crown. After this, there were no more bastard kings of Denmark. The Norwegians possibly had eight bastard sons in a row (one claimed to have been such, but was not recognised), see Wikipedia. By contrast, Sweden has had only one known bastard king, Emund the old. 

This is a difficult topic to find good sources for, because this war is largely forgotten in Sweden. It was not a very dignified affair, and was overshadowed by the catastrophic defeat in the Finnish War a few years later. Most Swedes, even historically interested ones, would not know about it or be more than dimly aware of it. (The article in Swedish Wikipedia is actually a translation from English and only briefly covers the Swedish involvement). The barbary corsairs were demanding tribute of everyone. They were not as powerful as they had been, but basically every Christian state that did any shipping around the Mediterranean sea still paid regular tribute. Sweden had also increasingly irritated since the corsairs of Tripoli had recently captured several ships, starting in 1797, demanding ransom. One such was paid and the prisoners released. Soon, another group of ships were captured. This time the prisoners were released on the promise of ransom, but it was not paid. This started a formal war in 1800. The next year, the pascha also declared war on the US. Sweden was not involved in the Napoleonic wars, and thus saw the possibility of allying with the Americans. Sweden contributed three Frigates, but as the Pascha held the crews of 14 ships hostages and threatened to kill them if the city was attacked, Sweden sued for separate peace in 1802. The Americans continued fighting, and reached an inconclusive peace in 1805. The US would be free of the demand for tribute through the Second Barbary War of 1815; Sweden continued paying tribute until 1845. Sources As noted above, it is hard to find good sources; this war is usually not covered in any detail, or even at all, in general works of history. I've relied a lot on this article by Torbjörn Dalnäs, who is a journalist writing on nautical history. Some details are confirmed here, in a blog post from Dick Harrison. He has written books on the history of slavery, which I own and have read, but don't have on hand right now. 

By 1940 and 1941 a couple of important fireside chats (e.g. explanation of land-lease) by FDR and speeches by Winston Churchill (e.g. give us the tools) probably had made some impact. In any case, by December of 1941 Pearl Harbor was the key event which perhaps would have turned the tide under any circumstances (see also wars following 9/11). 

My own reading has left me at believing that this (Buchanan's special longing apart) was fairly common in North America in the 19th century. E.g. Joshua Wolf Shenk's biography Lincoln's Melancholy contains this passage: 

I have always been impressed by the elegance, symmetry (and relative modesty) of the tetrarchy founded by Roman emperor Diocletian (245 - 316). Is it something that was invented at the time or does the system draw directly on earlier precedent? 

By counting the different religious orders that one could expect to find in a town such as Cracow one would already arrive at a fairly large number to boot: I would assume that Capucines, Franciscans, Dominicans, Jesuits, perhaps Cistercians and several others maintained presences at central sites because of their relations to court, to the local university, to hospitals, etc. It's a frequent pattern that can be observed in many (former) residential mid-size and large towns throughout Europe. 

Again, there is a bit more further information in a German-language diploma thesis from 2010. It analyses the Rhenish Missionary Society's publications from the time (and seems to arrive at or start from a more skeptical view as to the alleged importance of the society's noble role as viewed or presented in retrospect from a "white" angle.) BTW, whether this was "genocide" or not, von Trotha would not have been able to pursue it after 1905 (e.g. up to 1907 as implied in the question), for 1904 was the year of the incidents and 1905 was when he was transferred. The 1911 Encylopaedia Britannica, not always a reliable modern source on colonialism, gives a (to this reader's eyes) relatively fair account of the main actors involvements, but adds some own confusing language ("concentration camps were established in which some thousands of Herero women and children were cared for"). Further evidence could perhaps be recovered from German newspapers at the time (e.g. a Vienna-based newspapers provides a free online archive going back to 1848). However, I currently do not know any such source with a convenient online index. It also seems as if Ludwig von Estorff, one of the officers who tried to stand up to von Trotha in 1904, later had books published about his time in Namibia: They are (sadly) out of print by now. UPDATE: Paul Rohrbach's book Aus Südwest-Afrikas schweren Tagen (1909) is a collection of diary entries from 1903 to 1905. During that time the author was a senior official in then German South-West Africa. He mentions the Rhenish Missionary Society several times in passing but not in a way that would suggest his own affiliation. There also frequent references to the "Siedlungsgesellschaft". The report reveals a perspective observer and able administrator, even with a sense of humor (translation courtesy of Google): 

Medieval Scholars were much more sophisticated than they are usually given credit for. Knowledge of the shape of the Earth were never really "lost". Apart from their own observations, there were also classical works that supported this view. During late antiquity, Boethius had access to Ptolemy, even if it later was forgotten and had to be reintroduced to Western Europe. Two other works, however, Pliny's Natural history and Platon's Timaeus were available throughout the period. There are a few examples of scholars that suggested other shapes, but they were exceptions, not the rule. Some examples Adam of Bremen (second half of eleventh century) is known as a historian, and an important source of Nordic history, but in his Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum he also wrote on the midnight sun: 

Hector Alexander the Great Julius Caesar Joshua David Judas Maccabeus King Arthur Charlemagne Godfrey of Bouillon 

I will give a partial answer, focusing on Sweden ca 1250-1350, but this should be indicative of much of "germanic" Europe up until that point, in particular Scandinavia. Simply put, promulgation was not separated from approval, and approval was done using the same system that also ensured that it was followed: the thing. We should first note that there were several different things, from the lowest level (in Sweden härad or hundare, hundred), which were held with some regularity, but from every week to twice a year, depending on which part of the country, up to the large, county-level things. The things were not only legal gatherings, but also market days and a general gathering, so they were likely well visited. It should be noted here that in the start of the period, each county had it's own set of laws, which had similarities but were clearly distinct. The central thing was led by a lawspeaker, who was responsible for both stating an helping interpreting the law as well as leading the thing. Over the period, the local laws grew more uniform, and at the end of it there were only two sets: one for countryside, and one for cities. This process was done through the thing: for the law to be changed, every local thing would have to discuss and ultimately accept the changes. To ensure this, changes were often prepared by a small committee made up of the lawspeaker, the bishop, and local magnates. Sources Dick Harrison: Jarlens sekel discusses mostly the organisation ca 1250, and the earliest attempts at uniform laws in a few areas. Michael Nordberg: I kung Magnus tid covers the end of the period. 

For academic books that have reviews (rather than reviews of any academic book) a good informal starting point is Danny Yee's book reviews. He is a perceptive autodidact who in over 20 years has built up an impressive corpus of approx. 1,200 book reviews on many subjects. I am e.g. inspired by what he shares on books covering China and Chinese history. 

Sometimes it deliberately wasn't kept secret from the enemy. This is from William Taubman's Khrushchev: The Man and His Era, about the Cuban missile crisis in 1962: 

The following is from the article on Golo Mann (1909 – 1994) in the German Wikipedia (translation courtesy of Google Translate). Golo Mann was the son of German novelist and 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Thomas Mann (1875 – 1955). 

If one assumes that such a regiment consisted of perhaps 2,000 to 4,000 soldiers this would amount to several hundred dead soldiers in a "safe" reserve unit. Is this a realistic order of magnitude, or does Tolstoy perhaps depict an extreme event in relation to what typically occurred during battles in that period? 

Donal O'Sullivan's Dealing with the Devil: Anglo-Soviet Intelligence Cooperation During the Second World War (2010) looks at the intelligence situation in Iran: 

The best answer to the question that I have been able to come up myself so far points to silver mining e.g. in Kutná Hora, another UNESCO World Heritage property in the Czech Republic, from the the 13th and 14th centuries ("Kutná Hora is therefore rightly considered to be the treasure-house of the land whose wealth gave strength to the expansion of the Kingdom of Bohemia"). I remember reading David Graeber on that "there was a sudden burst of silver mining in Saxony and the Tirol" in the 1460s (most of which would ultimately be shipped off to China). Those two regions did not experience own Golden Ages to my knowledge, so that could suggest that silver mining is at best a necessary but not sufficient condition for the Golden Age of Bohemia. (On the other hand, I believe both regions were also parts of the Holy Roman Empire at the time when Prague became its capital with Charles IV's imperial election.) 

Tom Au's answer above is mostly correct with regards to Norway; Albrecht actually had a formally stronger claim to the Norwegian throne, but was set aside since Margrete was so effective. As for Sweden, Albrecht had been king there since 1364, and Margrete only really came to power in Norway and Denmark in her own name in 1387/1388 (she had been regent for several years then). At that point, the Swedish magnates had been able to reduce Albrecht's power greatly, but when it looked like he would regain it in 1386 when Bo Jonsson (Grip) (Sweden's most powerful non-royal person ever) died, they allied with Margrete. Exactly who fought on which side in the following war is not clear, but the end result is: Margrete won, and proved a much stronger regent than Albrecht ever was. As for power, it should be noted that while Denmark-Norway was usually much stronger than Sweden during the 15th and 16th centuries, during the years before the Kalmar union, things were not always so. In the early 14th century, Magnus Eriksson inherited the Norwegian throne and was elected king of Sweden (this was mostly a formality at this point), he was also able to exploit Danish weakness and bought Scania. It was at that point in no way clear that Denmark would eventually end up the stronger power and stay so for over 200 years. That it was can partly be ascribed to the Sound dues, which generated a steady, large revenue and gave the Danish king political independence from the privy council and diet. Denmark also had closer ties to Europe in general, meaning stronger diplomacy and easier access to mercenaries. 

While it seems obvious that naturalized immigrants from an enemy country and prisoners of war require different attention and treatment in terms of national security, Landsberger's fate and book may still provide the key to (one aspect of an answer to the) question: if the U.S. would have interned German-Americans, how would it have made the presumably necessary distinction between Jewish refugees from Germany (many of them born there and with German passports) and the "evil" sort of Germans? Presumably any distinction on a large scale would have been hard to administer, and the supreme court might not have had it even during times of war. 

The shaking of Hitler's left arm and the fact that he tried to hide it is also mentioned on several occasions in this biography. 

I've heard (in an interview with German biologist Josef Reichholf) the argument that the Romans extended their empire as far north as they could grow their wine. A first glimpse at the map suggests that this could be true at least as a general rule. (The climate in Britain was warmer at the time.) Would this then be a coincidence or could it be something that indeed had influence on the expansion strategies of the Roman empire? In particular, are there any relevant traces in contemporary (Roman) sources that point towards an answer? 

Assuming that Swatch sells their plastic watches also in the U.S., there is their notion of Swatch Internet Time (beat time): The notion has not become popular in Europe or even Switzerland (where the company originates) so far, but insofar as this is a serious, globally acting company, their (marketing-driven) attempt can (perhaps) be counted as a (somewhat) serious alternative system. The reference meridian is fixed at at Jakob-Staempfli Street, Biel, Switzerland. I'm posting this @ 288 beats, BTW :)
