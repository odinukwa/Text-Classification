After you acclimatize and donate blood, you won't have to repeat your acclimatization programme, because your red cell production will still be up from your previous programme. You will however be required to wait for your body to replenish it's red cell count from the blood you've lost. I imagine that you'll feel somewhat the same donating blood at altitude after you've fully acclimatized as you would donating back home. If you already know how your body performs after donating blood, then you can probably expect it to perform the same at altitude as long as you're acclimatized and feeling fit. If you've never donated before, then I would NOT recommend trying it for the first time high up on a mountain, unless it means saving a life of a friend. 

The real question is what won't ravens or crows eat. Ravens hang out at the garbage dumps and perch on dumpsters, the easiest way to get them to visit your yard would be to leave garbage spread out behind your house, or leave a hunk of rotting meat nailed to a perch of some sort. They will eat pretty much anything. Crows are always in competition with seagulls, but you typically see them eating roadkill more often than gulls. We have plenty of such birds up here, and they are not something you want to wake up to (CAW! CAW!). Most people around here try to scare them off and keep them out of their yards by mounting fake owls on their houses, and making sure their garbage is covered up. We had a real problem with crows and magpies eating our dog's food off the deck, so we stopped leaving his food outside. That would probably be your best bet for attracting big carrion birds to your yard without offending the neighbours, try dog or cat food, they'd probably appreciate either wet or dry food. 

Dyneema Properties Whether or not your sling would be cut by a rock edge depends on how sharp the edge is, and quite frankly if you're dragging you protective gear over a razor sharp edge then you're probably doing something wrong. Features in the rock that could cause damage to your gear or rope must be taken into consideration when lead climbing, if you find yourself in a situation where you are going to be dragging your rope or laying a peice of pro over a ginsu arête, then you should probably consider setting up a new anchor or belay and try to climb around the feature, or setup a short belay with minimal fall potential just to get over it. It may take some extra time, but if the alternative is a potentially tragic accident that leads to a fatal fall, then it's time well spent. There are products that are designed to protect your rope over sharp edges. if you're climbing a route that you know has a notorious sharp edge, you should probably consider bringing something along in your rack: Rope edge protector: 

Rocky Mountain Canadian here, The easiest way to identify good boots for ice is to simply feel the rubber on the soles. The softer and the stickier the rubber on the soles of the boots, the better traction they will provide on ice. Vulcanized natural rubber is the best. The gold standard for winter boots in Western Canada up in the rockies are Sorel Boots. I have one pair of Sorel Glacier Boots (rated to -73°C!) that I've worn for 21 winters now, and apart from being a bit sun bleached they're still in great shape. Despite the decades that have passed since I bought my boots, the soles on the new boot are still the exact same design. 

Get a proper backpack for a DSLR. I literally carry my DSLR backpack everywhere. It's basically my man-purse. The model I have has a camera pocket on the side, which I can access quickly by dropping one shoulder strap and opening the zipper pocket. I've had the same bag for about 8 years now. The only time I don't carry my DSLR hiking bag is when I need a bigger bag for overnight trips, or when I'm going on a climb or hike where I decide I don't want to bring my DSLR (I've smashed cameras before while rock climbing, and sometimes prefer to enjoy the activity more through my own eyes than the eye of a camera). 

The trick to preventing chronic athletes foot in toe shoes is the same as with regular shoes, and that is to wear socks. 

For the same reason carrion birds circle over fresh kills: They're waiting for an opportunity to swoop in and get some food. All the gulls see is a large gathering of humans, which typically means dropped chips, bits of hotdog buns, discarded scraps, leftovers on tables, people throwing bits for the birds. Wherever you have big gatherings of large mammals there will be flocks of scavengers. You'll see the same behaviours in nature too, scavengers will follow herds of deer or caribou waiting for one of them to either drop dead or get picked off by a predator so they can swoop down to pick away at what gets left behind. The reason they ride the thermals and circle overhead is so they can conserve energy while they watch and wait. 

These crampons are made for kids shoes, and fit a size 28-39 (US/CAN 11C - 6.5), and to be honest are probably adequate for anything a kid that size is going to have the ability for. 

Those are Cicadas, they live in the ground for years and crawl out only to moult their skins as adults and mate. 

I still use the old Thermarests, which are norotiously difficult to pack down small. What I do is slightly different than what has already been suggested: Start off by quickly getting the bulk of the air out however you wish, I over inflate my mattress, so often I only have to open the valve while I'm getting out of bed, and by the time I've gotten dressed and packed up my bag (while kneeling on my bed) my mattress is mostly deflated. I'll then quickly fold the mattress over a couple times and just sit on it to get the the rest of the bulk out. When rolling my bag I follow these steps: 

I made one of those rigs once out of wooden poles and and a tarp for a sail. Instead of a gooseneck, I just lashed a round ring to the boom. It's not super stable, but it was cheap and easy. 

You're sleeping bag only works if you can get it warm. If you wear too many clothes in your sleeping bag, you're not going to fill the loft of your expensive down mummy with cozy warm body heat. This is what can happen if you're wearing your liners in bed, the bag around your feet doesn't warm up. I think whether or not you get cold toes depends a lot on what else you're wearing under your bag. If you're in your base layer and wearing your liners it shouldn't be an issue, but if you're layered up as well as wearing your liners, then you're not going to warm the bag, and your extremities will pay the price. 

For the same reason it matters in any other chase: distance gained in a pursuit brings you closer to the objective. Sailing upwind is like climbing up hill, it's slower going as opposed to being on flat ground or going down hill. Small gains upwind at slower speeds are as the book indicates: they count the same as larger gains at higher speeds. The quote quote above isn't indicating that windward gains are especially important, it's drawing attention to the fact that relatively shorter gains windward are equally as valuable as greater gains in a stern chase. 

In this situation, if you wanted to preserve the life of the snake, I would have recommended you used your poles to pick it up, swing it out over the gorge side of the trail and place it back on the ground behind you. You may have also had success using the basket of your pole to hold it's head down while you walked past. Myself, I would have simply flicked it out into the gorge, there's no sense risking life and limb for the sake of a snake, the snake would probably land in some branches and survive the fall anyways. 

Birds do not typically reuse nests, as pests and parasites typically move in and use it as a habitat after the birds are done with it. Those birds who do reuse nests often don't have much success raising healthy chicks, because of said parasites. Also, predators have a much easier time finding food in nests that have been around for a while vs. having to find new nests. Birds will build their nests in the same spots though. I have Robins that build under our deck pretty much every year, but they only come back if I get rid of the old nest first. 

So my toddler just barely fits the smallest child's harness on the market, which of course means she's big enough to go climbing and rappelling with daddy ;) I've been playing around with different techniques of tandem rappelling with her (both walking and free rappel) and I'm wondering what established techniques people use for different ages/sizes of children? What are some good techniques for tandem rappelling with a small child? 

I just learned about the via ferrata route in Banff on Norquay, but if you don't go with a guide then it's considered trespassing. Are there any via ferrata routes in the Canadian Rockies that are open access? 

The ice is on the wrong side of a rather wide creek. The nearest crossings are pretty far away, and the approach from either direction would not be easy (steep cut banks, cliffs and thick trees). The easiest route to the ice is across the creek. I found one spot to cross that looks only about knee deep, and the water is flowing probably a little bit faster than walking speed. Now I'm just trying to decide what would be best way to get across with all our gear. I'm thinking an extra pair of boots and pants combined with some warm blankets/towels and a thermos of hot chocolate at the other side. Pants off would hurt, this water is painfully cold in the summer time, I can only imagine what it's like now... What's the best way to wade through a creek in winter? Anyone know of any painless winter water wading techniques? 

Depends where the hole is and how big it is, but: 1. First, determine if it's neccessary to try and patch the hole in open water. If you're close to shore, then go ashore and patch it there. If you're losing air faster than you could get back to shore, then you need to act quick. 2. Locate the the hole.If you can't find the hole, then you can't stop the leak. A hole below the waterline will be given away by bubbles, a hole above the waterline should be audible. If you kill your engine you should be able to hear a large hole, a small one can be heard by sticking your ear against the hull. If you can't find the hole, then you're only option is to replenish the air in the craft. Hopefully you have a pump on board and the inflation valve is one-way. If so, then you could try and pump air back into the craft as fast as it's leaking out. At the very least you could buy yourself some time to get closer to shore. 3. Stop the hole.If you do locate the hole, you need to put something over it to stop the air loss. A small hole above the water can be plugged with a finger or patched with duck tape or a proper patch if you have one. A hole through the bottom could similarly be plugged or stopped from above, but if you have a hole below the waterline then you're going to have problems. A hole in a the bottom of a dingy isn't going to be so easily stopped. In a rigid boat you can fother something under the hull and use water pressure to stop the leak (typically a sail/collision mat/tarp, in a smaller craft you could use a GoreTEX jacket), but in an inflatable craft you have the issue of air escaping under pressure. You're best bet is going to be plugging it with something, if you can reach it. In desperation, you may consider flipping the craft over so you can dress and patch the hole. After a patch is in place and cured, then you could put the craft right side up again, and replenish the lost air. 

I've never been in tiger country, but I do have some experience with big cats. We have lots of cougars in the Canadian Rockies. When I was a kid we had 3 cougars roaming around my hometown making easy pickings out of people's pets one year. Some rangers came to our school and taught us how to avoid an encounter, and defend ourselves if necessary. Their advise was basically what I told you; stay in groups, be loud, and don't wander into the woods. 

Avoiding Pump: Warm up, warm up, warm up. To avoid serious arm pump you need to do at least 15 minutes of EASY climbing. That's 15 minutes of you doing what you feel is exceptionally easy, even if that means doing traverses back and forth across the wall, or climbing up and down a step ladder. You want to activate your muscles and get the blood flowing so you can displace any lactic acid that will build up when you start to climb hard. The best warm up I ever had in my life was when I was in university taking a sculpting class. I spent 8 hours straight carving a plaster sculpture of my fist then went climbing right after. There was nothing I couldn't hang onto. Hours or carving had warmed my arms up so well that it felt like they would never fatigue, I was pulling on some of the hardest crimpy holds to hang onto and never got close to getting pumped all night. It was amazing. Similarly, there's an event the University Climbing Club does called "The Everest Challenge" where teams climb the elevation of Everest on the climbing wall in 24hours. All the teams get to the point where they feel like they could climb indefinitely. They climb the easiest routes the whole time, and after about 30 laps they're pretty warm and keep going all night. The point is that warming up needs to be slow and easy. You can't rush it, you need to take the right amount of time to get yourself ready for climbing. Another tip for preventing arm pump is to relax when you climb. Don't try to juice the holds, find a good stance and focus on your balance so you can take a lot of the weight with your legs instead of with your arms. People with bad technique pump out way faster than climbers with good foot work. Treating pump: If you feel yourself start to get pumped: stop climbing, relax for a bit, and let your arms hang while you gently massage them or swing them around to try and get more blood flow through them. You need to treat the pump before it gets bad, then perhaps spend some more time gently warming up. Stretching isn't the best thing for arm pump, stretching is better for arm fatigue, which is different. For pump you will have more success rubbing, kneading or shaking your forearms to help clear the lactate. One thing I would do in bouldering competitions when I started getting pumped, was to run lines on the floor. Arm pump is caused by lactic acid build up in your arms, so increasing blood flow will aid in clearing that lactate, and upping your cardio is the easiest way to get your heart pumping and get that blood flowing.
