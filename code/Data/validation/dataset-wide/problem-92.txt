Well, first there's the whole "reach down his throat and pull out his spine" bit. If the hero can wrap his hand around cervical vertebrae, it's pretty clear he can simply punch through the neck and snap the spine of any zombie, so it's hard to see what he'd get out of using a spine. Frankly, I'd suggest he go for a femur and use it as a club. Thigh bones are pretty durable. Pulling out a spine is one of those great images that doesn't seem terribly realistic (you think?). The problem is that if you can pull hard enough to disarticulate the 24 ribs attached to the thoracic vertebrae, it's hard to see how the vertebrae themselves would stay attached to each other. Nerves aren't noted for their strength. As for the idea of using the coccyx as a point, you'd need to disarticulate the sacrum from the pelvis, and that joint is very strong. Again, I can't see how you could manage it without ripping the spinal column apart. The flexibility of the spine is not very great, but I suggest that the compressive strength of an unsupported spine is not very great either, and I'd worry about the spine buckling on impact. So, you're pretty much stuck with magic, I think. 

Let's take this one attribute at a time - O2 - 54%: At this level, almost any organic material will burn explosively. CO2 - 45%: This is about 5 times the toxic level for humans, so that's probably out. SO2 - 1.2%: Since no country allows worker exposure (long term) of even 1 ppm (.0001%), and about 20 ppm (.002%) is lethal for long exposure, this atmosphere is guaranteed to kill almost all known life forms. And let's not forget the omnipresent acid rain, caused by the combination of SO2 and water. Lots of acid rain. Atmospheric pressure - 0.115 atm: This is the pressure at about 50,000 feet. Even with the higher oxygen levels, humans cannot function at this pressure. And, obviously, birds can't fly, since the low air density means their wings cannot provide enough lift. The only "good" part of this is that the fire hazard is probably not a problem, since the total amount of oxygen available to a fire is almost too low to support combustion - although I'm not certain of this. So, pretty much across the board, your planet cannot support life outside the ocean. And the life in the ocean must be pretty vigorous to support the oxygen fraction, especially in light of the SO2 levels, which imply an enormous level of volcanic activity. The SO2 will constantly be combining with water vapor and washing out of the atmosphere. On earth, the half-life of SO2 in the atmosphere is about 6 to 24 hours, although this would obviously increase under high concentrations due to lack of sufficient water vapor to combine with it. But the high replacement rates suggest that the oceans will become very strongly acid within centuries to millenia, and how such an ocean is going to keep producing free oxygen is not remotely obvious. 

Non-biological food synthesis is likely to be an iffy proposition, if for no other reason than the issue of trace elements. You've mentioned the obvious elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, and phosphorous. You've left out a whole slew of others: sodium, chlorine, iodine, zinc, selenium, copper, molybdenum, chromium, calcium, iron, magnesium, bromine, manganese, silicon, nickel, boron and vanadium, at the least. See here, for instance. Management of these elements is likely to be tricky, since many of them are notably toxic in large quantities. Note that some elements seem to be needed in ng/kg quantities. Plus, the issue of bioavailability needs to be considered, especially since many of these require ingestion in certain classes of compounds, and may or may not be usable if not in the appropriate form. 

This would be a monumental effort. Not only would you have to produce the chromatophores themselves, you'd need to to add a parallel nervous system to control them, plus a rewiring of the brain. This would involve wholesale modifications to the visual system to make the connection between what is seen as the environment and the control of the chromatophores. The added neural function would have to replace parts of the current brain architecture (unless you're willing to specify an increased brain size), so it's not clear that the resulting soldiers would remain psychologically human. 

This is a profoundly inconsistent set of rules, so you can make up pretty much anything you like. As long as you don't want consistency. 

Due to some handwavium, ships are slow but really cheap. So pretty much anyone who want to can travel, although life support for a journey that long won't be cheap. To address this, you might also invoke a really cheap cold sleep (hibernation) process. With that said, you've got a real problem with habitat construction/terraforming. 2 billion on Mars suggests that something really bizarre happened to make the surface livable. The alternative, that 2 billion people live in artificial habitats, simply does not bear consideration. The expense would be fabulous. 

This is possible, but probably not with the consequences you imagine. Being able to buy a foothold in Europe would make various governments salivate. Russia and China would be intensely interested, and for all I know North Korea, ISIS/Daesh, and Al Quaeda would jump on the bandwagon. Your concept of "no government control except of the borders" just doesn't work. Either a nation controls its territory or it doesn't. For example, if a tenant smuggles a nuke onto his plot, or starts working on bioweapons, will Greece sit idly by? Not hardly. In fact, if the territory remains Greek, Greek laws are going to apply, and any prospective tenant must understand that the policy of "hands off the micro-state" is only guaranteed to be good until the next election, or a public outcry about the uses to which the land is being put - whichever comes first. If the tenant is allowed to develop a micro-state, and the status is not a sham, then the micro-state must have sovreignity. While this may seem pretty innocuous, since any private group won't have the military muscle to butt heads with the Greek army, there is nothing to prevent the micro-state from making an alliance with a big brother (such as Russia), and then the situation gets murky and uncomfortable real fast. Of course, various groups would bankroll straw buyers who would immediately declare for their sugar daddies, although this would have the immediate benefit of driving the bidding up to stratospheric levels in short order. As for the question of local inhabitants, I don't know Greek law well enough to declare this with certainty, but certainly in the US the doctrine of eminent domain would allow the locals to be moved off the land with a "fair market value" payment and no legal recourse. See particularly Kelo v. City of New London. I suspect Greece has something similar. 

You are overlooking a critical point. Actually, you've conflated it with another. There is no reason to think that women limiting their fertility will (by itself) cause "children usually survive to adulthood." This is (or was) largely a function of childhood diseases and (mal)nutrition. If the kids are dying from diphtheria, diarrhea, pertussis, etc, limiting births will simply result in families dying out. Recurring stressors such as famine/crop failure just increase the problem. Additionally, having suggested that warfare is the male ideal, the question must be faced of just how much warfare actually occurs and how lethal that warfare is, both to combatants and noncombatants alike. If the average family produces 2 children per generation, a boy and a girl, and half the young men die in battle, and every generation or so a country gets invaded and half the countryside laid to waste, well... the outlook is not good for the culture. Colonial America, as an example, had an average family size of about 6 children, but half of them died before the age of 5, so the high birth rate was not a cause of the mortality, but a response to it. And this has generally been true right up until the 1800s. 

The obvious approach is to replace nitrogen with a denser, inert gas. Since nitrogen is the only inert non-noble elemental gas, the noble gases seem the obvious choice. There are, however, a few difficulties. The densities at STP for the various gasses are as follows: Nitrogen 1.25 kg/m^3 Helium .178 Neon .90 Argon 1.78 Krypton 3.73 Xenon 5.89 Radon 9.96 Helium and neon are both lighter than nitrogen, so they won't do any good. Radon has a half-life of about 180 days, so we can forget that. That leaves argon, krypton, and xenon. It may come as a surprise, but xenon makes an excellent general anesthetic, so let's not adopt an atmosphere which renders us unconscious. Argon and krypton are both useful contenders, as long as you keep in mind that both act as anesthetics at high pressure, about 5 atmospheres for krypton and 10-15 atmospheres for argon. Iserni has brought up the problem of spontaneous stratification, and in principle this is true. However, weather (wind) provides a powerful mixing mechanism. Whether this would be adequate is beyond my powers of analysis. 

I cannot pretend to give an authoritative answer, but the nature of snowflake formation should be kept in mind. The canonical snowflake shape (approximate hexagonal symmetry, flat plate, branching) is actually produced in only a small portion of the possible temperature/relative humidity phase space. Without a very detailed analysis, and probably a great deal of experimentation, it's simply not at all clear how ammonia snowflakes would form. 

I'm afraid you've got a wrong picture in your mind about how an elliptical orbit works. It seems clear from your description that you think the ellipse can be centered on the center of the suns' mutual orbit (this is called the barycenter). So your seasons' description has the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock as being the closest approach (perihelion), with 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock as the farthest away (aphelion). Alas, this cannot be so. For an elliptical orbit, the barycenter must be at one of the foci of the ellipse, not the center. Also, since the planet orbits well outside the mutual orbit of the two suns, those two must orbit each other much faster than the planet orbits them. This means that, although you do get a significant change in total radiation when the relative position of the suns changes, this varies much faster than the orbital distance. Let's say the suns orbit each other at 1/3 the distance of the planet, which is assumed to have a circular orbit around the barycenter. Note that I'm pretty sure such an orbit is grossly unstable, but I'm willing to suspend disbelief for the moment. We'll also assume that sun A has twice the luminosity as sun B, but both have equal mass. Set the total luminosity when the two suns are equidistant from the planet at 1. Then, just before A occults B, total luminosity will be about 1.6, and just before B occults A the total will be 1.07. For this configuration, when the two suns are equidistant their apparent separation will be 37 degrees. For this geometry, when the suns are equidistant their distance to the planet will be greater than the distance to the barycenter, which is why you get more heat at each occultation. Roughly speaking, with the suns orbiting each other at 1/3 the distance of the planet, they will do so 9 times faster than the planet, so the rather large variation in heat will occur approximately monthly. Accounting for the fact that the two really ought to be rotating in the same direction as the planet orbits, you'll get 10 cycles per solar year. If the planet has an even larger orbit two things happen. First, the relative intensity of the cycle will decrease. At longer overall distances the relative distance variations will decrease, which means the variations in total luminosity will also decrease. Second, the number of solar cycles per year will increase. If you now change the planet's orbit from a circle to an ellipse, this will impose an annual luminosity cycle on the shorter solar cycles. Finally, you should be aware that any major luminosity cycles will be catastrophic to the climate of the planet. The problem is that such temperature variation must be referenced to absolute zero. A variation of 2 to 1 in total insolation will produce an equilibrium temperature swing of 40%. With an average temperature of 27degrees C (300 K), this will have a total temperature swing of about 100 C. Although this will occur over a relatively short time period (think a month rather than a year) I think you'll agree that this will make for challenging conditions. 

These creatures are "very humanlike" - what does that mean? The two obvious choices are a) they look like people (more or less) and behave like people (more or less) but they are examples of an entirely unrelated biology, and are farther away from us genetically than a cabbage. Or b) they are the result of earth organisms from, let's say, 20 million years ago being transplanted to another world. If a) then there is no problem. Nobody knows for sure why animals sleep, so whatever is going on when we do can presumably occur in your humanoids without needing sleep. Or their biology, particuarly their mental processes, simply don't need it. For instance, it's generally accepted that sleep allows long-term integration of memory, but there is no obvious reason it can't happen "on the fly" - it's just that the sleep mechanism happened first, or is biochemically/genetically "easier", and has been preserved. If b), then things get much more complicated. Sleep is one of those processes that is pretty much ubiquitous in animals, so it's hard to imagine how a replacement process could have evolved and replaced it. After all, it hasn't happened on earth in the last 20 million years. And coming up with an explanation of how a process/structure could replace sleep is made much more difficult by the fact that, as I say, nobody has a really good idea of why sleep is so necessary in so many species.
