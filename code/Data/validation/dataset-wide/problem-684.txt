As the comment by @Chris H, pointed out, you may have some air in your system. This is easely solvable by bleeding the brakes. Dependening on the design, you may need a big syringe, small hose(ideally translucent) and a small discardable bottle, or a propietary bleeding kit. Hydraulic system needs to be bleeded at least once a years, IMO. WARNING: Never mix mineral oil with DOT, those are incompatible. You must choose properly your fluid Dot or Mineral Oil. Mixing DOT5 with DOT6, is fine, not recommended but fine. Check the fittings on the handle and the caliper, tight them if needed. Some air may be getting into the system due to loose fittings. Also check the bleeding valves too. Lastly, check the hydraulic lines while you pump the lever. If they seem to stretch, wide, or inflate a small ballon, etc. You will need to replace them. 

Start by checking that the axle is clamped firmly in place. The connectors are part of the axle assembly and shouldn't be able to turn with the hub unless the axle is loose. Note that the comment above about having the connections on the right hand side of the hub applies to older versions of the SON28. The newest versions (the 2015 40/48-hole tandem hubs as well as the 2012 and later versions with the smaller flange permit the connections to be on either side, $URL$ 

The tricky parts are the size of the center clamp area of the handlebars and the areas where the brake levers clamp to the bars. There are many choices… Older road bikes tend to have a 25.4 mm center area, newer ones may be either 25.4 or 26.0 mm, your stem has to match. Some stems are 26.0 mm with a shim to take them down to 25.4. Brake lever clamp sizes are also different between mountain and road bikes. You'll want to pick your bars and then select brake levers that will fit them. The other thing you'll need to be aware of is that brake systems have two varieties of "pull" – how much cable movement it takes to actuate the brakes effectively. Caliper brakes like you have, and cantilever brakes (which are common on mountain bikes) use a "short" pull. V-brakes use a "long" pull. It sounds like you need short pull levers. They may also be described as levers for cantilever brakes. If you like the Albastache bar it has the advantage of being sized to take road levers (23.8 mm diameter where the brake levers clamp on), so you avoid the expense of a new set of levers. It also has the possible downside of a 26.0 mm clamp area, so the money you save on levers may go towards a new stem. Ditto also makes a bar they call the Albatross which has a similar shape a 25.4 mm stem clamp and takes takes brake levers with a fairly standard, for mountain bikes, 22.2 mm clamp size. 

I know this type of hubs a Open Bearing hubs. You can have a "basket", a sort of ring that holds the ball bearings in position, and just ball bearings sticked with grease. The way the axle sits on them, fully asambled should be like, from left to right: LockNut(quick release if you have one),dropout,Counter-Nut, Cone,hub, Cone, Counternut, dropout, locknut. So, your problem is that you have play, but when you mount the wheel it goes stiff. For this problem you have to tight the CounterNut and Cone, together on one side. Then tight the other cone, just enough so you don't have play and runs smooth. Grab a thin wrench, if you have a cone wrench will be better, hold the cone with it and then with a second wrench tight the counternut. Don't overtight the nuts, as a cheap axle is really easy to stripe. If the nuts keep loosing themselves get some preassure washers(the spiky ones) and put one beteween the cone and the washer. cheers. EDIT: Probably the black thing is just a dust seal, which makes seem like a sealed bearing. 

I was fixing a flat this morning and discovered that the tube was adhering to the tire casing. The tube pulled free from the tire, with about as much force as it would take to pull off well adhered (but not "baked on") masking tape. I don't think I've ever encountered this before and I'm wondering if it is indicative of a problem? 

I'm trying to track down a dragging sound from some Avid BB-7 brakes on a Kona Sutra. The hub is a Shimano Alfine DH-S501 dynamo hub with an SM-RT82 Centerlock disc. The noise sounds like a dragging pad, but, so far, I've been unable to make it go away. Here's what I've done so far: 

That's usual. I've had many rims in many sizes, width, walls, etc; and most of them are like that. But I don't know about rims for tubeless. I think that they are made like that for two main reasons. In first place, to allow for slack for the valve when you mount it, even thought they are standarized sometimes you can get a "fatty" valve depending on the tube brand. The second reason, if to compensate for deflexion of the tube material under pressure, so it won't get pinned and punctured when you inflate. Because sometimes the valve it's thicker at the base.

This is by far the safest way to remove stripped bolts. Other method i've used include to drill a hole on the bolt, and then screw a special tool with counterclock thread to unscrew the bolt out of place, while you screw in the tool. Also you could just drill the bolt out, but you might get to damage the threads on your dereaullier. The last method, only works on a couple of situations where the thread are not seized, is to take the head of the bolt out. This will take tre preasure off the thread and you can fiddle with it until unscrewd. Did this on a KTM Duke 390. Cheers 

The significant numbers are the "50-559" which translate to 26" x 1.90" – my best guess is that what you're seeing is a molding problem that causes the '6' to look like a '5'. The 50-559 is the ISO size of the tire. The first number is the width (50 mm) and the second is the "bead seat diameter" (559 mm). Beware of 26" tires – there are two sizes that are called 26" and they are not compatible. The easiest ways to tell them apart are by the width where you will see either a decimal width, say 1.50", or a fractional width, say 1 1/2". The other method is to compare the ISO size which would be something like 37-559 for a 26 x 1.5 inch tire or 37-590 for a 26 x 1 1/2. For riding on roads slick tires are nice, they give you the largest contact area for a given tire size. You need to balance that against durability and availability. Tires like the Schwalbe Marathon are built for durability, but aren't really slicks (at least not in the sense of a tire like the Kojak). Do look for a tire with a "slick" strip down the middle which is where you'll be riding most of the time. 

Get a hold on a dremel with a cutting wheel, and Draw a line from side to side(Over the center, like a Diametre line) about the same depth of the hex tool that was supposed to loose the bolt. If possible, rotate 90 degrees and do the same a point 1 Dip the the part in "Light Coke"(this thing works wonders on siezed bolts, not so much on your health tho) for about two hours. If you can do it overnight, that's ok too. Optional to (3.), pour some wd-40 on the bolts and threads. If it's has threadlocker then you will need a solvent, like Isopropil alcohol, acetone, or just a plain soldering iron to heat the bolt and soften the thing. Use a Slot ScrewDriver on the lines you made with your dremmel. 

You are correct that the 42x26 is telling you that the large ring has 42 teeth (and the small 26). I did a search on "M785 replacement chainring" and found a number of sources (but nothing a Chain Reaction). Looking at what I found it appears that the options for the large ring are 38 and 40 teeth. So… Either Shimano has changed the specs on the M785 and the 42 tooth ring is no longer available, or there is s typo on the Cube site. I'd say it's worth looking at your bike to see if the tooth count is stamped on the chainring or, failing that, count the teeth. If it is a 42 tooth ring (and you want the higher gears) it might be worth going to your LBS to see if they can order the 42 tooth ring, or else look for NOS (new old stock) rings on places like Ebay. 

Even tought there are many great answers I want to weight in, with my very personal perspective on the matter, also I'm from Chile were traffic laws are somewhat questionable for cyclist. In first place, over anything else it all comes down to your cycling experience. I've been a rider since 3 years old, now 31 and have never stopped. Been riding BMX, Downhill, CrossCountry, Freeride, Street and Road. Why this matters you ask? Well is all about reflexes and habits. People is not really well educated about traffic, driving test are a joke(I drive a truck, motorcycle and bicycles), so most of the drivers will put everyone in dangerous situations without thinking. Furthermore people can park on the right side of the road, so you have to watch right and left when going on your bike. So in my opinion this should be the way to cycle around a city: 

First off, the number one cause of broken spokes is not enough tension. When spokes aren't tight enough they load and unload with each revolution of the wheel – basically they are getting bent back and forth each time they go around. Over time they break, just like bending a paperclip. The most likely place for the spokes to break are at the bend at the hub. Any good wheel builder knows this and will take great care to get the spokes uniformly tensioned. Once the spokes are tight enough they don't load and unload on each revolution and they will last a good long time. Here's what you need to know to order a new wheel: 

Sometimes I carry a fuel bottle down there when touring. It is out of the way and if the bottle happens to leak it doesn't cause much trouble – certainly not like having a leaking bottle of white gas in a pannier…
