It appears your nervous system may need some help. You need to spend time in nature, also try walking meditation barefoot. Avoid caffeine, sugar, nicotine, excitable entertainment and other stimulants. If you can exercise, or perform yoga, that will help. Meditation needs a healthy body, brain and nerves for best functioning. However, this is hardly the end of the road - you can develop khanika samadhi or momentary / moment-to-moment concentration with vipassana. This kind of meditation is ideal for insight and for progress on the path, so there's no need to worry. 

If there is beauty, there must be ugliness; If there is right, there must be wrong. Wisdom and ignorance are complementary, And illusion and enlightenment cannot be separated. This is an old truth, don't think it was discovered recently. "I want this, I want that" Is nothing but foolishness. I'll tell you a secret - "All things are impermanent! Ryokan,Â One Robe, One Bowl: The Zen Poetry of Ryokan 

It is a beautiful thing what you are doing. Respecting your body, the environment and all beings is the first path of the Bodhisattva. Respect is not necessarily attachment. Buddhism recommends we have a healthy belief in impermanence, but not so much that we ignore caring for everything. The Buddha warns his followers to practice hard while they still can. Because sickness, injuries and death can occur at any moment, and interrupt their practice, they must not put off practice for later. Buddhism is not found in sutras and big and ancient words, it is found in the practice of seeing the truth in every moment. We obviously can't practice if we are losing consciousness due to an injury, or delirious with fever. We must take medicines at this moment and respect that our practice is dependent on causes and conditions, such as our good health. We likewise cannot practice if we are lost in luxuries and delusions of reality, mistaking our comfortable conditions for permanent bliss. 

Source: $URL$ One cannot understand the meaning of these terms sufficiently by poring through a Pali dictionary; true understanding in these cases is experiential. Not everyone attains these states in sequence, one's mind can skip some steps, or one's attention may not catch them when they occur. If one is on a retreat, and only practicing Anapanasati for several days, one can certainly come very close to the textbook definitions, but that doesn't make the experience special. What makes the experience special is the several days of sustained practice. 

I've read that Ryokan strived very hard to be identified neither as a poet, nor as a monk nor as anyone special. I wonder if an examination of his intentions isn't slipping away from this moment into judgment of the unknown. How can anyone know what he thought or meant - I can hardly comment on the intentions of people I meet everyday in my life, let alone of someone I've never met. Sometimes I read things I wrote a few years ago, and I wonder to myself, what was I thinking, and I say, it doesn't really matter. Does anyone stand up to an examination of all their utterances? 

She is ready for stream entry by merely practicing this dry insight. The rest of the story is quite instructive too, but doesn't pertain to dry insight. As regards the difference between meditation practices of monks and lay people, there are a few traditions today that seem to institute such differences for various reasons - too painful, too difficult, too complicated, however there is no practical barrier to practice per se. Painful ascetic practice of the Dhutanga monks were rarely attempted by lay people for obvious reasons. In the time of the Buddha it wasn't unusual for lay people to take temporary vows of monasticism on retreats lasting even a few years. This was more popular (see caves of lay people where they retreated a few months a year in India) in contemporary religions like Jainism which even included very painful penances. Meditation is synonymous with Buddhism today, but even in Buddhist countries like Burma meditation almost died out, with most monks eschewing meditation in favor of sutta practice. It was laypeople who sometimes preserved the tradition of meditation. For example, Sayagyi U Ba Khin (1899-1971) and his disciple S.N. Goenka (1924-2013) are famous lay meditators of Burma who revived and spread a branch of the Vipassana system world wide. Anapanasati Sutta: Mindfulness of Breathing is the canonical meditation taught by the Buddha. However, the Buddha taught over forty kinds of meditation. 

If someone is a health nut who goes to the gym daily, and only eats organic food, they can't really hang out at burger joints with their friends, the smell of deep frying will be revolting. Does this make their body volatile? We all know it isn't possible to stay as healthy by eating burgers and fries, so we allow them their salads, there is social acceptance for that. Hanging out at the gym or park instead of at the bar after work becomes their routine. Sugary or deep fried junk food tastes bad to one who has been on a healthy diet of natural fruits and vegetables. Persist with eating junk, and the body adapts. Same with altitude sickness, dust, noise and other kinds of pollution. The emotional body is the same - it doesn't like difficult emotions of the outside world. Since a few years now I find even regular family TV soaps featuring some manipulative characters very violent - just the idea of deceit and lies is revolting. This is not volatility, it is the emotional body protesting at toxins. Our physical and emotional bodies are trained to recognize good health, and they guide us towards it by protesting harsh environments. They are keeping us safe. Ignore the warning for long enough, and they will lose the ability to warn. Unfortunately, there is a school of thought among a few modern teachers that one must remain emotionally healthy despite operating in toxic emotional environments. Most modern successful work places are very toxic with lots of busy but shallow relationships where everyone is looking out for themselves. Showing an interest in the emotional affairs of another at the workplace is threatening, because everyone is trained to view the others as opponents. We are at war in such work places that emphasize "professionalism". Ambition and competition are violence, and there is violence in just about any modern activity. For example fashion that makes us regret our bodies is violence, food that is tasty by contains no nutrients is violence, entertainment is by definition violence because it takes us away from our inner self. Meditation is going to make us intolerant to violence at work, at home - and anywhere else. This may mean giving up some things we previously loved - a job, a neighborhood, a city, a partner. Or it may mean giving up on a life of peace. When I moved to urban India I began coughing blood. I visited a doctor who pointed out that I simply wasn't used to high levels of pollution. I could either stay in the city and get used to it in a few months, or live in air conditioned environments and never mix with crowds or leave the city. It's a choice we all have to make with emotional environments. 

On Buddhist retreats and at most Buddhist monasteries the morning meditation session is at around 4:30 or 5:00 am. 

There could be several reasons why your practice has plateaued. Without more background it is difficult to help. Here are a few common ones. 1. Ethical Transgression If we have broken the sila (moral precepts) in the course of our personal issues, that's a very effective dampener on the practice. Apologising or making amends, and letting go of guilt are the appropriate remedies. 2. Accepting plateaus as normal Going for an intensive retreat, preferably with a good teacher might help, but to be honest, plateaus are a part and parcel of anyone's meditation. As long as our faith and perseverance aren't fading, we can't wish for super deluxe concentration all the time. Every athlete has periods when they are not in form, every meditator has periods when their mind isn't seemingly responding to their commands, but it is still evolving. This isn't regression, this is impermanence. 3. Clinging to life situations Learning to let go of challenging life situations is a skill to be constantly developed. Like a flower dies without water, our practice of letting go dies without watering it. If we are bothered very much by a life situation and retreat to meditation as a safe zone, it can help initially, but later meditation can become difficult until the life situation is handled or fully accepted. 4. Fading faith and perseverance Doubts about the effectiveness of the dharma, questions about one's own practice, questions about one's method or teacher can all lead to lacklustre concentration. 

I hunted down a reference to the lotus posture in the Satipatthana Sutta where it is stated in passing, as a matter of fact; so it is likely the lotus posture was one of those very obvious things to Indian yogis of the time that doesn't need much specific mention. 

A good friend is one who helps his friend become a better person, even at the cost of popularity. I think reasonable people definitely do understand dietary choices when it's explained with humility and reason. As your friends, they ought to be capable of respecting your wise choices in life. 

Often in the suttas one finds Bhikkhus who approach the Buddha reverentially uncover their right shoulder as a mark of respect. What is the significance of this practice? Is it cultural or is there a deeper significance? One example from the Ratnakuta sutra 

And, as I already mentioned in the comment above, according to Hindu scriptures and yoga manuals the advantage of the lotus position is that it is self supporting. In arupa-jhanas (also well known and practiced by Hindus) when one has lost all sense of the body and mind, a lotus posture will ensure one doesn't fall over. This doesn't specifically mean the Buddha sat in this posture under the Bodhi tree, but if he's advising others to do so, it is likely this was how he sat always. 

This is a fundamental question about all entertainment - why must entertainment be eschewed? First, the nature of boredom is that it arises out of a mind that isn't at ease with itself. The nature of thought at the moment a bored mind arises is to gravitate towards the outside world - towards sense pleasures. Distracted thought gets reinforced with every application of distraction, so much so, we live in a world where hardly anyone reads books, and more and more people even find Twitter too much text - they want videos or GIF images instead. If we make a habit of mindfulness, then the opposite is true, at every opportunity the mind will seek mindfulness. Second, the nature of boredom is that it gets excited by violence rather than peace - it is an existential threat mechanism that is woken up and makes us come alive. Thus entertainment is the enemy of equanimity. Thirdly, entertainment reinforces duality, of the entertainer and the entertained. It makes us lapse into being controlled by external forces, rather than taking control of our mind. It is thus a quality of mind to be safe guarded against. 

There are wholesome actions that are not caused by boredom. Any action arising out of compassion (karuna), loving kindness (maithri), sympathetic joy (mudita), equanimity (upeksha) is not born of boredom. (See: Bramhaviharas) 

Likewise pressing one's tongue against the roof of the mouth calms the mind, as does yogic breathing. They are not essential, but if we know what we are doing they can help. Conversely, by misapplication, they can also hinder. For example, when our concentration has passed higher than the point of a specific mantra or binaural sound, using them will bring us down in my experience. Likewise yogic breathing exercises done without expert knowledge can lead to health problems and dullness of mind. I think given the risks, we must let this binaural audio technology evolve some more before depending on them. Pressing the tongue against the roof of the mouth, and uttering Om or other seed syllables have stood the test of time. The tongue technique is difficult to get wrong, and thus has the endorsement of the Buddha. 

DISCLAIMER: It isn't that such phenomenons don't occur during Buddhist meditation, but typically such bodily phenomenons are not emphasized in most Buddhist traditions, and thus Buddhists lack the vocabulary. Tibetan Tantra practice is an exception, but that's because it derives a lot of its vocabulary and practices from tantric yoga. The subtle body is viewed in Buddhism as personified impermanence. From your description it appears to be a spontaneous Mula Bhandha. Like sneezing or coughing, spontaneous yogic postures are natural bodily occurrences, and are nothing to be wary of. They are triggered by conditions. For example, we sneeze in response to being in a room full of dust, similarly, when there are certain subtle energy manifestations in the body that are in need of correction, the body makes use of such locks or yoga mudras. 

Entertainment is a CNS stimulant like coffee. Some people wake up to dance music to feel happy, or dull their emotional pain with death metal. To one who has control over their emotions, and already conserves the vital energy of prana or qi, all entertainment is frivolous, because it messes with what is already perfect. Enlightenment can thus be also viewed as a lack of need for CNS stimulants, including entertainment. In Buddhism, anything that doesn't lead to enlightenment must be eschewed. 

If your friends don't understand your beliefs, and if you are of the Theravada bent of mind, then the answer is very clear - go alone, avoiding false companions. If you are more worldly, then there's other very sociable passages to quote from elsewhere in the Buddhist canon. 

Buddhism or meditation is not a pill one takes and immediately becomes free of thoughts. Learning to not get bitten by thoughts also takes lots of time and patient and wise effort. The lotus cannot flower without the mud, so it certainly does not help the lotus if it hates the mud. Don't hate the mind that produces sexual thoughts, or develop aversion towards yourself for having them. Nirvana is not obtained by hating Samsara. Instead, learn that this is natural, but you can slowly learn to handle it. Develop a desire for Nirvana, and practice with a teacher. Monks often battle sexual thoughts after decades of being celibate, and this isn't because they are ignorant or stupid. It is a tough challenge, but one worth pursuing and succeeding at. A lot depends on why you want to control those thoughts, and your time line to achieve it in. Some people decide that it's too much to attempt at one go, and remain lay Buddhists who don't take vows of celibacy. Sexual thoughts that result in a breaking of the precepts on sexual misconduct are more dangerous, and can be treated more easily. Seeing the suffering of the person who is the victim of the misconduct and developing compassion for them is a very effective way to control this. For example, if one is cheating on one's spouse, reading an internet forum where partners who get cheated on express their suicidal emotions, can for example be very sobering and shake one up to resolve to never do it. Watching a hard hitting documentary on sex workers, and their conditions, and listening to them speak of their psychological issues, again often leading them to commit suicide can make one resolve never to visit one, and so on. I recall a Dharma talk by Ajahn Chah who uses the same Cobra analogy. 

We can't put out a fire by burning in it. We must first distance ourself from it and use the right extinguisher. If you can get back to the breath, that's excellent, but it's not always possible. The rest of the answer is for this reason. You haven't mentioned the kind of negative energy or thoughts that come up, knowing this is important in choosing the right extinguisher. For example, this is a good guide book to handle anger: Anger: Wisdom for Cooling the Flames by ThÃ­ch Nháº¥t Háº¡nh Dharma must be good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end. There is no need to suffer through the negative emotions more than strictly necessary, sometimes further progress is impossible for a long time if we enter a downward spiral. Some call this the dark night or something equivalent. Facing our dark sides or Dukkha Ã±aÃ±as are unavoidable, but until we are prepared to handle it with equanimity we must have some shortcuts or hacks in our back pocket to get around the negativity, lest it consumes us in depression or hate and derails our life for years together. Learn to practice loving kindness towards yourself and your mental formations, it is an excellent extinguisher of inner turmoil. Helping others and practicing loving kindness towards all produces a gentle lubrication to one's practice. Vipassana does not have to mean only hard work and suffering through the harshest winters of the mind and body. It can be gentle, and was intended to be beneficial and pleasing. There is a time for serious practice, but there must also be self compassion. May your practice succeed. May you be happy and well. p.s. Knowing why an emotion arises is not always possible, the body is a highly complex system like the weather system, and like predicting the weather it is often impossible even with the best knowledge and equipment. Insisting on knowing why something happened before helping oneself by attending to it is unwise. It is like insisting an arrow not be pulled out until the shooter is found. MN 63
