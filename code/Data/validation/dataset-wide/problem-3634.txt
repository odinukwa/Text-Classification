I started thinking about this because of some advice I was given recently. Yesterday I auditioned to be a model in a new fitness magazine. The interviewer said that he would like to see me increase ab depth. He said that increasing reps (to 500/day) and training abs daily would be really increase the depth of my abs to make them really "pop". Does this sound like good advice? 

Edit: Elaborating on the improvement I have seen in arm growth in general - About 3 months ago my arms measured around 15.5" and have increased to 16+ (They vary, sometimes up to 16.5 without a pump). My arms have been getting bigger, triceps and bicep peak are increasing, but bicep width remains stagnant.

The safest way to avoid injury is always maintain good form and if you feel any joint pain STOP what you are doing. 

I don't know as much about the biological makeup of muscles as I should, so my answer is going to be based on the results I and many other fitness fanatics have had from doing workouts similar to the ones you have described. 

There are several great workouts you can do at home to workout legs. Now, keep in mind, running is not so much about building leg muscle, but a more cardio related activity. I'm not saying you won't work the muscles, but most people don't run to build leg muscle. Now, on to leg workouts. There are plenty of good body weight leg workouts out there and generally (in my experience) I've only ever had knee pain from weighted leg workouts (besides running). I'll keep that in mind when I recommend workouts though. Squats Squats are a great exercise for working legs. Keep in mind, they do sometimes cause knee problems, so if you start feeling pain STOP. Squats will work the quads. 

Is it possible to workout too long? If so, why? At the beginning of this year I started really working hard at the gym and would lose track of time and would sometimes workout for almost 2.5 hours. The workouts usually consisted of 2+ hours of intense weight lifting followed by 15-20 minutes of ab workouts. I never had any negative side effects from it though. After doing some research, I noticed a lot of people thought this was too long. I may need to create a separate question for this, but I've recently read that during long workouts BCAAs may be beneficial. Would adding BCAAs mid-workout allow you to increase the workout length? 

In order to engage your chest during dips, lean forward slightly. It doesn't really have to do with the width of the bars, rather the angle of your lean. That being said, leaning forward will still work your triceps as well. See this article for some good info on dips. 

Note: When I am doing any excercise I make sure my form is always as good as possible and my reps are generally slow and controlled with an emphasis on negative resistance (i.e. letting the weight down slowly. All sets are to failure because I am trying to build mass. 

Simple - if you cannot correctly perform exercise A because you are exhausted, decrease the weight. It doesn't matter how much weight you use as long as you - 1. have good form 2. are pushing yourself to your desired limit. From my personal experience, my chest days generally consist of multiple different bench press exercises, with some flys and some serratus work. By the end of the workout I have done about 5 different exercises. The reason I can still do flys properly after I have exhausted my chest from bench press is because I use the proper weight to maintain good form during the exercise. 

Examine.com does a great job at consolidating a lot of research to give unbiased information related to a specific supplement. After reading their article on BCAAs it seems that if you have a balanced diet and would consider yourself more than a novice athelete, BCAAs in general, are not effective. Are they effective for 2-a-day workouts? I would refer to my answer above. I don't think working out twice a day would increase the effectiveness of BCAAs. 

I understand that "Abs are 70% diet and 30% training" and all of the other cliches out there about "how to get a six pack". This is not the purpose of this question. I think all of those cliche sayings have ruined my focus on abs. I went from training hard 5 days a week to decently easy ab workouts 3 days a week because people kept on saying "abs are made in the kitchen". I do not want to know how to cut fat off of my abs because I don't have much as it is. I can see my abs and obliques very well and I am now working for ab depth and mass. So my question is, how can I increase the depth of my abdominal cuts and the size of my abs? I'm assuming that both are related in that - increasing ab size increases the depth of the cut.

You could also consider doing some stiff leg dead-lifts and standard dead-lifts, but these don't meet your "bodyweight" requirement. 

In my opinion, it sounds like you need to increase the weight you are using and add some variety to the kinds of curls you are doing. Like Jaydee stated, you might want to also decrease the number of reps you are doing. Personally, I like to do about 8 reps and use a weight that only allows me to get those 8 reps (so I'm working until failure on the 8th). However, increasing weight may cause you to sacrifice your form, which is NOT a good thing. You can find hundreds of videos/tutorials/guides on proper form (here is one example - Proper Form Dumbbell Bicep Curls). Overview 

My Personal opinion - I think that if you maintain a healthy diet and drink PLENTY of water you shouldn't have any problems. I'm at about 300 grams of protein a day which includes 12oz of chicken, salmon, peanuts, 2 whey protein shakes, a mass gainer shake (50g of protein) and a casein shake. I have been on this diet for 3 months now and haven't had any issues. 

Currently, I am training abs 3 days a week for about 15 minutes. I usually pick three exercises and do as many sets of 20 reps as I can in 15 minutes. I can usually complete 3 - 4 sets which (or 180 - 240 reps). I switch it up every day and make sure I target obliques, lower and upper abs. I usually take one day to focus on hanging ab workouts so I'm not always on the floor. Current Exercise Regiment 

First of all, this all depends on the protein he is taking and some other life style aspects. My initial answer is that this is not a problem because supplements are simply meant to supplement your diet. getting 30 grams of protein from a shake isn't really different than getting 30 grams of protein from chicken or any other source of protein for that matter. 30 grams of protein, is 30 grams of protein. Protein is necessary for muscle recovery after a workout, but it does not harm your body if you do not workout. You have to look at his diet as a whole rather than just this one protein shake. Meaning, look at the total amount of proteins, carbs, fats and calories he consumes in a day to decide whether this protein shake is beneficial or not. 

The reason the workouts are grouped as they are is because they are all complimentary muscles. When you workout your chest, you also work triceps so it's a good idea to go ahead and hit triceps as well that day. Same with back and biceps but not so much legs and shoulders. I just threw shoulders in there with legs to fit your 3 day schedule. Sample Routines Shaun's 3 Day Muscle Building Split Workout - This routine switches triceps and biceps, but you can always just do the reverse (for a while and then maybe switch it back) 3 Day Workout for Beginners (You can find plenty of great workouts online.) 

I think adding a combination of protein and carbs to your post workout shake would greatly benefit you and improve recovery. Recommended Supplements -

I use to have the same problem and one thing that really helped me out was holding the bar at the bottom of the movement for 2-3 seconds before pressing back up. At the bottom of the bench press hold the weight just barely above your chest or wherever your normally stop, do not rest it on your chest. I would recommend doing this with less weight than you normally rep because it does exhaust your muscles pretty quickly.
