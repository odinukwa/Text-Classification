The information that you've dabbled in other languages (possibly outside your course) is useful to an employer. However, as others have said, you don't want to represent familiarity with a language or technology you've only dabbled with. There's no reason you can't just list your proficiency alongside each language or library. You could do this in a quantitative way (number of projects completed, number of years of experience), or you could qualify it with some sort of label. I've seen this done using an analogue to spoken languages like this: 

I am currently the manager of a team of 15 people. In two weeks' time I will leave this job for a totally different one, in a different sector and a neighbouring city. At my current job, I have one member of staff (professionally qualified) who has a very challenging personality. Although highly intelligent, she seems to have no awareness of how she comes across to people; and she comes across as dismissive, presumptuous and condescending most of the time. She's a know-it-all in the worst kind of way. Among her more irritating traits is the tendency to reply to brief announcements or requests, delivered to the whole team via email, with very lengthy (500-1000 words), structured emails, outlining what she sees as every possible objection anyone on the team could have to it and detailing every aspect of the request/announcement she thinks could go wrong. She typically sends these within hours of receiving my email, putting into question her time management skills. (Luckily though, she doesn't usually "Reply All".) Prior to a recent conversation she and I had over a more inflammatory missive, she seems to have been unaware that nobody else was responding in this way, and indeed that few of the objections she anticipated ever came to pass, and never seriously. I think she misinterprets idle chatter, and the usual mild criticisms of one's boss, as expressions of deep dissatisfaction on the part of her colleagues. I know that she has ambitions to move into management, and I also know that the team would revolt if she managed to do this, given her personality flaws. I am sympathetic to her though, because I know she is professionally frustrated. I believe she continues sending me these emails because she wants to show me she has the chops for management -- unfortunately, it shows me the opposite. Before I leave, should I take her aside and tell her this? Would this help her, or be a waste of time? She has a history of missing the point, and at this stage (she's about 40) she's unlikely to change. But I also feel she has a right to know what is holding her back. 

The answer almost certainly depends on what country you're in. It doesn't say on your profile, so here's an answer from where I am (Australia - though I would assume it's similar for most English speaking countries). Shaking everyone's hands at the beginning of the day isn't normal anywhere I've worked - In Australia shaking hands is usually for the first time you meet, or perhaps if you haven't met in a while. I would say it's likely that the managers are just doing this to introduce themselves the new guy. Although you say "regularly" I would guess that: 

It sounds like this is a great man to have in your life both professionally and personally. Make sure you do whatever you can to keep this person a friend. Regarding your new position, people grow and people move on. Make sure you communicate to your boss how great this new opportunity is and how you would have never been able to get a shot at it without his excellent tutelage. Thank him for his immense generosity with his knowledge and time, and tell him that you are going to pay it forward to any junior members you come across so that you can try to be as great of a mentor to someone as he was to you. After that, do a fantastic job documenting anything you can regarding a knowledge transfer, get your projects wrapped up or to a good stopping point, part ways as friends, and invite him out for a beer or coffee 30 days into your new job. 

Since you're new, you might want to introduce yourself to others in the company. With small companies, you can meet and shake hands with everyone in the first couple of days. For practical reasons, in a large company I would only introduce myself to the people who I interact with during the day - whether they're people I work with or just someone I happen to be making coffee next to in the break room. Just say "Hi, I'm the new guy, " and shake their hand. 

If your manager is impressed with the speed of your work then I wouldn't worry. If you still feel inefficient, then I would say instead of just reading whatever on the internet, read things that are relevant to the kind of work you do. That way, the long breaks you are taking are really just professional development time. 

I don't see anything wrong with telling her directly that you aren't sure about your word choice. There's no need to beat around the bush. I would write an email, something along the lines of: "Hi Debbie, thanks for writing the proposal for a project that is long overdue. We will all benefit from an update. However, I'm a bit worried about saying that it's "unstable" - this isn't technically accurate and I would hate to see this thrown out on a technicality. You never know what management will pick up on. Can we meet up to talk about another word to describe the system? Thanks. Paul." Because there is an implicit criticism, I'd say an email is the less confrontational way of starting the conversation, but it should lead to a face-to-face conversation. If you have experience of submitting similar proposals you could bring that up too. 

Of course, keep in mind that you might be asked difficult questions about anything you say "expert" or "native speaker" about - and as a student, nobody is expecting an expert level of proficiency. Consequently, you might also like: 

I personally believe that conveying the appropriate level of respect is unrelated to using their title. For example, it's possible to use the right title and still be disrespectful. I think it is more important to show respect by being polite, listening and valuing what they say, not wasting their time, and so on. 

I have a colleague who has recently dyed his hair to be darker and not quite as light and gray. I think it looks really good and I would like to comment on it, but I am not quite sure how to approach it. If I say "Hey, your hair color looks great!", it brings attention to the fact that I was aware of what his hair looked like and that I noticed how drastic of a change it is. Perhaps he thought it was just a very subtle touch up and it would not be a big change, but now his colleagues are aware that he dyes his hair. How can I comment on a coworker's change to their appearance (whether it is teeth whitening, hair coloring, tanning, etc.) while being sensitive to whether or not they meant it to be a drastic change or just a very minor change that only they would notice? 

You should say so right away, but that shouldn't be the only thing you say. In your initial contact give details of your experience and the type of work you want to do. Explain why you are attracted to their organisation. Explain that you would like a job that is part-time, but you wouldn't be opposed to increasing your hours in a few years' time (if this is true). In short, you don't want the requirement to be easily missed, but you don't want it to be front and centre. Even if they don't have anything for you right now, you will have made a good impression. 

It depends on the culture of the university you're at - but if in doubt how to address anyone, you can always ask. At universities in Australia and New Zealand, an informal "Hello" is probably fine. I know of a few departments where formal titles aren't even on the office doors - just names. However - if you're feeling awkward because you're unsure whether to be more (or less) formal - why not just ask? Just smile and say something like "I'm actually not sure how to address you because I'm also a student - what would you prefer?". Most academics I've met prefer informal greetings, and if they've directly given you permission to address them informally, then you don't need to feel awkward about it. Similarly, if they prefer the title, then just treat it as if it were their name, and carry on as usual. 

I would suggest you take the laptop they are offering and use it strictly for work. Use the work laptop for work, and use your personal machine for non-work related things. You can get into real trouble if sensitive information gets on to your personal machine and gets compromised, especially in the healthcare vertical. You can also get into real murky water if you happen to produce a real cool program in your free time and the company claims it as theirs since it was done using their property (check your contract). Another thing worth noting (not my area of expertise) is that the computer expense may be totally different on the books than a signing bonus. The finance department might not want to give out cash and would instead spend it on hardware. P.S. See Ed Heal's post about other logistics of using a personal machine. The company most likely does not want to deal with those headaches as well.
