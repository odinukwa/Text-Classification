Yes, this term applies to philosophy. I think we would put Nietzsche in this category. Had he read Baudelaire? Probably, but it doesn't make any difference if he did or not, it was in the air, so to speak. Kant could be a candidate too, in the century prior, and not just Kant but the other early German idealists. Let's not forget Voltaire either, and maybe we could stretch a bit and even include Diederot as 18th century fin de siecle due to his late works. Now back to Nietzsche, we see him straddle the romantic and the modern. The key to the modern is that it stripped away all mediocrity and pretense. Picasso, Les Demoiselles d'avignon (1907), Schoenberg's early musical works: both shocking for the time, all pretense and fluff are torn away in these works. Had they read Nietzsche before they produced these works? Maybe Schoenberg had, but again it was in the air. And of course in science too around the turn of the century and afterward began to be extremely productive. So I think I think this concept is not just the "very end" of a century, as I'm sure you know. I should also note that it took a while for Nietzsche's books to be known, and for them to be translated and so on. And how could I forget Frege? Also, even though the neo-Kantian professors began to peter out, their students began to cut their teeth then and to forge new ways, so much was happening, and I'm sure if we looked back further we would find this happening with other philosophers in prior centuries. By the way, I take for granted fin de siecle means end of century, but it just so happens that new eras often emerge as things heat up toward the end of one century and they carry on into a new one. 

(All)P then Pr = All(cd1) <- (c1) (If there are all propositions, then, those are provable) (several)P then G = several(cd1) -> (cd2) (If there are some propositions, then, several of propositions are typical G) G then Pr = (cd2) <- (c1) (If some of propositions are typical G, then, those are provable) 

Answering "how many dimensional can be perceived?" The more surfaces with different dimensional can be perceived by something, the more something can be considered having more consciousness (more aware) Answering "how many for the details of specific surface of specific dimensional can be perceived?" The more the details of specific surface of specific dimensional can be perceived by something, the more something can be considered having more consciousness (more aware) 

FIXED EXISTENCE : Something (without additional assertions) can't transcend beyond something itself. From one liter water (without additional assertions) can't be poured as much as 1 gallon water. Meaning: All existences (without additional assertions) can not transcend beyond all existences (their self) All Existences are Fixed (or aren't fixed): If the number of all existences are not fixed, then, the number of all existences (without additional assertions) transcend beyond all existences (their self). It against axiom. 

Can a point divide two lines? Yes. Now to the question of belonging posed by Luke in his fourth sentence. If we were to snap the lines into four at this point of intersection, must we dicide which end to stick the point onto? No, and I am unanimous in this. Whence "belonging"? The point is gone, there is no longer any position to mark. All the point ever was was a position at the intersection of two lines, each line is just length. There is never any sense of a point belonging at all. A point has position only. The geometers say we can only describe the point, line and surface; let no one say we define them. That's what they say. All "blessings" flow from this trinity, which begin the process of definition and underlie the definitions of all other geometric terms. 

Yes I think so. "Strictly speaking, what admit of truth and falsity are NOT statements as repeatable patterns of utterance, but individual events of statement utterance". Emphasis mine. "The crucial point of contact between description and reality is to be sought in the utterance of a statement on the occasion of a stimulation to which that string of words has become associated." Both from Pg. 1, Quine, Methods of Logic, 4th ed. (Harvard Press, 1982). This answers your question I think, though it may not seem to do so. How would you measure changing truth value over time with anything less than a series of individual events of statement utterances based upon individual occasions of stimulation? (Very loosely speaking, at logic-level we are digitized,0101001 e.g. etc, not analog). 

If there are times, then there are changing continuously without moving anything. Consider when we are watching movie. The story in a film represent sequences and we will see time differently, but there was nothing moving out of television. All artists were playing within display. If somehow we put consciousness inside the film on specific artist (just like dubbing), then the artist suddenly would realize that there was time stuck on a movement. But people outside the box (we were watching) knew that there was no movement 100 meters jumped out of display. The display may stand still, and the liquid inside the display was still there. We saw time within a film. We saw different times, but according to the player (DVD or VCD player), there was only one time for all actions on a film. One time with consistency. From within a film there was different time, different speed, but from outside the film, there was (closer to only) one time, (closer to only) one speed. It's like changing a specific binary number one at a time continuously and it will change the whole story continuously. It's like rolling a binary number once or multiple times for one or all events. All events are changing at one time continuously. If we can "pause or play" all events, then "one click for all events", one click again to change to different set of all events. 

If you were to plug in different modules for space and time in the Transcendental Aesthetic, or if you were to fiddle around with his categories, what would this to to his project of wanting at least something to be "fixed" in place? True for all, if you will. Remember, the world of phenomena is already contingent, so can't something stay put and be true, permanent and pure? So non-Euclidean geometry would have been a bombshell for Kant, it might have shaken him to the core (at least for a while). So it would have damaged Kant's project, but it would not have damaged his way. See Cassirer's idea here: $URL$ We don't seem to mind such changes today. Kant 1.0, 2.0 etc like software updates, but this kind of thinking does not fit well with certain kinds of metaphysics which seek permanent truth, fixity, etc. And I should mention that Kant was trying to scrape together what knowledge he could. It was still limited in the fact we don't know the thing-in-itself per Kant, and this hanging problem of the thing-in-itself served as the irritant-stimulant to the next great round of German philosophy: Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Schopenhauer. 

Liar Paradox An example of the use of dependency of proposition can be implemented to analyze this issue, a liar paradox. Liar paradox, "He is telling the truth that He is lying, therefore He is not lying." Syllogism 

Anything we do based on our thinking and our emotions. Whether we did something because of someone else, but eventually we did: 

Discussing about moral (based on religion or ethics generally) are rather broad, but at least there is one thing we can hold on. It's not about "moral act has to be necessarily beautiful" or more and more ... . But at least moral act or ethics (to the specific extent) as far as we can try to accomplish, that we must "do not hurt yourself and do not harm anything involved with us" as good as we can do it. There are number of definitions, categories for something to be considered "do not hurt yourself and do not harm anything involved with us". But the point is, this philosophy ("do not hurt yourself and do not harm anything involved with us") may be a start for us to ignite our creativity or to inspire our acts to do properly (whatever standard we use). Perhaps doing so, somehow we can put our acts in line with harmony and perhaps it looks like beautiful. It's not about telling that goodness is not beautiful, or it's not about telling that moral acts has no relation with "has to be necessarily beautiful", but it's about placing our starting point at correct placement, and further the beauty on our acts will follow later, i hope :) . 

I think you are exactly right, we do have to clarify this for ourselves. Don't we replace all the cells in our body every tens years or so? Maybe not our brain cells. And some cells have a much higher turnaround, the lining of our lungs and digestive tract are constantly being sloughed off and replaced, I think. But we nevertheless carry with us the feeling of mental and physical continuity. The individual qua individual can't find a "me" or an "I". We have to credit Hegel with this insight. The self-definition of the self as self comes when we encounter the other, and the object in general. We have to come against limits to begin to define ourselves. Then the question is whether the "Bildungsroman" of lived life is enough. This Bildungsroman-process is our education, and the hard knocks we take in life, the education of Spirit/Mind. But in addition to this it seems we have to cast ourselves forward, we need an intention toward the future to maintain the "me"; this we see really in Nietzsche, and the Heidegger of Being and Time, and in Sartre too. The background here is Schopenhauer, and maybe Kierkegaard too, I am no so familiar with Kierkegaard. But it's complicated in that we tend to fool ourselves into thinking we are unique when in fact we are not. We are captured by the "They", Heidegger, or by our instincts, Freud, everything we think WE are is merely the product of total mediation (Frankfurt School) It's not really our thought, it's something we heard on the news or some such. When we say "me" or "I" this is a self-reification. And as Adorno said, in all reifications there is a forgetting. We tend to forget not only the history of our life and education, but the totality of the world that is wrapped up into us. It is sadly possible to see ourselves today merely as a reified object for sale on some market, the job market or the love and sex market. The human in us is crushed down into an object to be marketed, and ultimately to be thrown away. This sort of alienation away from the fullness of Being is kind of ceasing to be. So now we are lost again, where is the "me"? The existentialists are probably right that we can (we must), in an atomized world, for our own mental health, and even if it is a fiction, transcend the in-itself by some projection forward (goals, whatever). Even if it is a fiction, we hold ourselves together and organize ourselves by being in and for "ourselves". The loss of self-organization, or the loss of the necessary fiction of the organized self or me, would be the ceasing to be, or psychosis. It's not so much the physical body, since we discharge and replace the physical body all the time. The end of the self-narrative projected forward would be the ceasing to be. P.S. The problem today is that the pressure for the narrative is all on us. Society and religion used to provide "the" story, now under postmodernism and in a porous world, we have too many stories, and life is short. The need for the personal story would be less if there could be "our" story, but this would require a less atomized world. We can hope that existentialism is only a solution for this present time in our history. 

It's not direct answer, but it's the fact that moral act doesn't have to be necessarily beautiful. But the most important is: 

(ONLY IF) (there is the need) (Stating a Bi-Conditional in plain English), then, (there MUST BE) (there is implementing a Bi-Conditional using "OnlyIF-Must") 

Depending on your definition, an argument might be like this. Abortion is not wrong, because women have a right to control their bodies. 

It may be considered incomparable in between "something" Versus "nothingness" (whether it maybe considered "doesn't make sense", contradiction in between both or whatever), but it can be considered as our trial to push our logical to the farthest extent and see where is it going to? And eventually it asserts there is only "dimensional" which assert "something". 

Our domination within boundaries is strongly dependence to our ego. Each time our ego is being threatened, then our domination is being threatened. And our ego have ability to push ourselves to dominate as far our own available functions (potential) that can be realized without obstacle. If our ego are being threatened and this threat restricts our ego to release our functions as human, then ourselves will try to find something better to support our functions as human. If our ego was failed to dominate, further our Id will not be satisfied, and we need another chance (freedom) to fulfill our needs There must be better synchronizing in between our functionality as human and something to support ourselves. Without this, our domination will be threatened easily, and our ego will be threatened, further our freedom (to fulfill our needs) will be restricted.
