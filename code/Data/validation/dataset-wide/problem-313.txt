The 'tell' is obvious if it is checked for, but no one thought to check him because he didn't have defects. Most of the time, a child born with a disability is checked by the delivering physician (or healer or alchemist, whatever your world has) or midwife, or a physician later in life when the disability becomes apparent. But as your hero was healthy throughout his life, and as the more 'obvious' effects of his mutation were still subtle, he never had the test. Storywise, it would make sense if it could be accidentally discovered. I'm thinking something like a blood test: maybe a mutant's blood turns a different color when mixed with sulfur and heated. Maybe he trips in a bat-infested cave and wounds himself, then cauterizes the wound, and the sulfur from the guano reacts with the blood from the wound as he heats it, thus revealing his mutation. Something like that. 

A mental link is not much of a problem You ask, "would the mind be able to cope with controlling its own motions while also sending motor orders to body parts it doesn't even possess?" and the answer is "probably quite well, in fact." The human mind is actually incredibly adept at adopting tools into its "body plan" and a number of experiments have shown how relatively easily it is to trick the mind into thinking that things that aren't part of its body actually are. Just think of the phantom limb phenomenon. You may think that that is slightly different because it's a limb that the mind feels like it 'should' have, but further experiments have shown that you can convince the mind that completely foreign objects are part of it. Further, adapting extensions to our body plans is commonplace. When you use a tool such as a wrench or grabber, it subconsciously becomes part of our body plans, and we sort of feel like we have an extended reach. We're not getting nearly as much sensory information from the tool, just a bit of vibration and resistance, but we still adapt it into our body plan to feel as though it is part of us in a sense. We work by "feeling" things with our tools. Even when we're driving cars we have a sense of adapting the car to our body plan, using information we get from sight and touch from the vibrations moving the vehicle to sense how close we are to other objects, how straight we are on the road, etc. Experiments in inducing out of body experiences have shown that where we feel like our consciousness is is highly susceptible to suggestion. There's nothing paranormal or supernatural about it - it's just a trick of the subconscious. But people have been able to be convinced that they are actually inside dolls that are larger or smaller than them,, for example. You see where I'm going with this: If the mental link is providing sensory input from the mech's body, and the pilot's body is not receiving much variance in its sensory input (he's restrained in a comfortable seat), then the pilot will pretty readily feel like he is the mech. And it does help that the mech already has the same basic body plan of the pilot - it is easier to trick someone into thinking they're a doll than a car. (Likely, this trick of adapting tools into body plans evolved alongside tool use, because it makes us feel much more natural when using them. Any master craftsman who has told you that they treat their tools as an extension of their bodies is not just being poetic, this is a real thing. I wouldn't be surprised if other tool-using animals have a similar cognitive experience, but it's an abstract question to ask a bonobo. Either way this is an aside since your protagonist is a human, presumably.) 

In our world, many branches of pagan belief, (and other religions) have a concept of a "higher self". This higher self is connected to a person's "soul" via an intangible stream of energy from their "cosmic conciousness" into the person. An example of this is Avatar, the last air Bender. The protagonist (Ang) learns from a Guru how to connect to this "cosmic self" by opening his 'chakras'. Doing so grants immense power (and control of his 'Avatar State'). If this concept was in your world a Reality, then perhaps the Evil Wizard harvests the souls, not for their innate energy - but rather to gain the magical-energy being communed to the earthly vessel from another plane of existence / the cosmos itself. Akin to forcing many streams to meet by digging trenches, thus forcing a river. While an average Joe may not be able to tap into this energy, if it is the driving force of wizardly-magic, the evil wizard may be able to "force open" the stream of energy granted to even an average soul. Perhaps even doing so to make up for his own impotent potential (being evil not allowing him to achieve "oneness" with the universe, like his teacher-wizard Kenobi tried (in vain) to teach him.) 

I believe the question is aimed at a scientific 'Macgyver' solution, in this regard, consider this: The scientist has a key-chain flashlight, by filing down (hunk of glass/costume jewl/quartz from the earth) he is able to focus the light to a point. He removes some bark from a tree (point A), focus' his light-source at another tree (Point B), and walks to it, removing some bark from the next tree, and pointing the source away from the first tree (A), he decides on the next point to travel to (Point C). Or, given a laser-pointer.... But that's too easy. None the less, it uses the play that light always travels in strait lines. This type of mechanism is often used for maintaining alignment of tunnels during mining - though on a more accurate scale. 

If you wish to use magic, you must apply for a permit. The permit is very cheap, or even free, as administrative costs in issuing and tracking them come out of the magic tax. If you are caught doing magic without a permit, you face fines, the severity of which depend on the "amount" of magic you're doing. (And possibly type, depending on what you want to enforce. Though using destructive magic harmfully would be a separate penalty.) Every year (or quarter or whatever, depending on how long energies take to dissipate), permit-holders must renew, at which point their auras are read and the tax is levied. There will be rogues and there will be people trying to cheat the system, but that's what ATF is for. (Arcana, Tetragrammaton, and Fate, of course.) 

One potential method: the lifecycle of the host organism is complex and evolved to include four different organisms. A fungus, the subterranean beast, the wildlings, and a worm. The fungus infects the worm, which then is either eaten by the beast or the worm itself is also a parasitic organism that infects the beast. The beast spreads out long appendages that resemble trees that it uses to collect nutrients, water, and oxygen from the surface. This is something that the beast just does, whether it is infected or not, but the fungus has hijacked this process to spread its spores throughout this network. Once spread to the 'trees', the spores infect the wildlings. Like Cordyceps, it causes a change in behavior in certain organisms that it infects. In this case, it makes them aggressive and causes growths of black 'skin' and 'claws'. The skin is actually a covering of the fungal spores - the same spores present in the 'trees', so the aggressive behavior helps to spread it further. The 'claws' are a by-product of a change in the production of keratin. The hive mind is accomplished through pheromone communication. We know that plants actually have rudimentary forms of communication - it doesn't sound like too much of a stretch that a fungus could. The "queen" is really the colony of matured spores living in the subterranean beast. The juvenile spores also communicate with one another. Granted this can't go long distances, but 'messages' can get passed along a chain. The ultimate goal is for the infected wildlings to die, whereupon they become food for the larval form of the worm that then infects the beast. 

I think it may be a mistake to ignore the environment to a larger degree. Life has evolved to handle immense pressures and temperatures, but not bullets - because there are no bullets in nature. If however, the environment contained objects with bullet-like potential, a very long slow evolution could indeed yield such results. The what could be anything from 'unobtainum' micro-meteors raining down on the planet every few days (from comet-trails composed of such a material), through to a common defence mechanism of other life-forms on the planet. (Plants that have evolved to "shoot" spines using chemical reactions). The latter plants is in my opinion a better option, as an evolutionary "arms race" would occur between armoured-animals, and the plant-guns. Many answers have centred on rapid-evolution, and I will state that I am certainly not. Evolution is rarely rapid in anything short of geological time-scales. @cobaltduck mentioned in the comments Spider-Silk, and this is a very good option. Spider-Silk Body armour is a possibility!, Spiders obviously do not weave fibres, though they may cocoon prey. However given millions (if not billions) of years in an environment that demanded it, it could be very possible for a species to evolve specialised cells that lay strands of Spider-silk like material beneath the hardened skin/scales. Another option that springs to mind is the Dragon Skin Body-Armour, using ceramic plates this man-made armour can stop AK-47 rounds at close range. While "baking" ceramics with strong composites is a intensive process for technology, Nature could (and would) find short cuts, depositing layers of material with specialised cells. Again, I place my favour on this second option - while it has already been stated there is no such thing as "bullet-proof", Ceramic plates are pretty-damn close in modern warfare, Modern combat armour often includes such plates, capable of stopping most rounds (short of armour piercing). Specificity the gamer's Favourite the .50 calibre. Good technical research for this topic would be the Cells involved in Bone Creation, Osteoblasts and osteocytes these cells constantly dissolve bone-calcites and place fresh layers.
