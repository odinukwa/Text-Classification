Review season is around the corner, woohoo! /sarcasm So long story short I've been working under a new boss on a new team for a few months now. Not by choice. Initially I was reluctant, but I'm now settling in quite nicely. To be honest, I went through a few personal problems in the past year or so and my performance was weak under my old boss. I know this. He knows this. I'm surprised I wasn't given any kind of "performance improvement plan" when I was working under him on a big project. At the end of the day though, our project was completed and we got it to production for our business users. I'd say that my performance is a lot better now under my new boss. Mainly because I'm a lot happier as a person, and I'm liking his overall management style as compared to my old one. The problem is that he's only seen my work for the past three months. He's definitely going to talk to my old boss about my performance in the last year and I'm certainly not optimistic about what my old boss will say. Another thing is that I had worked with another colleague on this big project (we were both leads), but given the fact that I went through personal issues, I let my work slide. I'm sure my colleague knows that I didn't carry my weight during this project, but I'm not exactly sure of the sentiments he has towards me. One of the requirements of the review process is that we must ask at least a few other colleagues to give us peer reviews. It'd be natural for me to get a review from him but, again, I'm not expecting a positive outcome out of this. I could avoid asking him all together but frankly I don't know else I would ask because the majority of my work and interaction has been with him in the past year. Should I tell my new boss upfront about these issues, or should I let things play out as they should? Never in my professional life have I gotten a negative review, but I'm expecting something as such this time around. What sucks is that I probably won't be getting a bonus this year because of that. This is all negative thinking and assumptions being made obviously, but I'm wondering if there's an effective way to approach this in order to maximize a positive outcome out of this, and ultimately a better raise(?) or better bonus(?) Thanks. 

Here's the context: I'm a Software Engineer at one of the most elite companies in the world, I've been in the industry for five years, having worked on numerous projects, ranging from small to very large in scope. I've had the chance to dabble into some really new and exciting, bleeding edge technologies. On paper, my resume looks great! I have five years experience, worked with lots of different technologies and languages, and I graduated from a respected university. Recruiters from prestigious companies, large and small always contact me. I'm on top of the world, and living the American dream! Or so I thought I would be...when I was much younger and naive. The sad dark truth is: I've been dealing with severe depression for the majority of my life. I smile, I laugh, I feel great around people, but at the end of the day, deep in my core, I'm not happy. Here's the problem I'm facing now: The last company I had worked for, I got along really well with my coworkers. A great group of people. Gregarious, easy going, and generally very fun to work with. However, I moved on for other purposes, in order to explore new opportunities to grow my career. I've been recently reconnected with a previous boss of mine, who I really respect and enjoyed work with him in the past. We've got along well, and he's always had a good impression of me. He's been asking me to join his start up for some time now. But now, he's really pressing for it becuase he needs me. Logically thinking, I would join him right now at the blink of an eye, but my depression has gotten a whole lot worse. If I were to join him, I wouldn't be able to perform to the standard that he has of me. I've been given multiple offers from other companies, but frankly, I'm not emotionally stable to join any other company even though it's the best for me career wise. I've put his offer off for too long now, and I don't want to tarnish this relationship with my past boss, I just don't really know how to effectively communicate this to him without seeming or appearing weak or disrespectful. I always had mentioned that I'd like to continue working at my current company for X amount of time to think things through. But I've delayed this for too long. What can I do? 

Sounds like you're still a relatively young guy, probably a few years out of college. I've learned this the hard way, and in particular, your story rings close to home to mine as I was once young like you. But, what I've come to learn is that attitude is everything in life, including your professional one. Not a lot of people have the luxury to be in their "ideal" job, or whatever fairytale dream a lot of young folks chase anyway. I don't mean to be pessimistic, but every job, and I mean...EVERY job will come with its headaches, no matter what. So what are you willing to you tolerate? And are you willing to reframe your mindset/attitude towards the things you can control? I used to be young and naive, I held onto a lot of frsutration inside, I didn't talk to my boss about anything, because I expected things to be spoon-fed to me. I contemplated "rage-quitting" every single day I was there, I even dreamed about how I would have such a grand "Eff You!" exit, but in the end, all the baggage just eats you up inside, and you gain nothing from it. I apologize for the tangent, but to your question about whether you should tell your boss that you're unhappy...I say yes, definitely, but frame it in such a way that it is constructive and can be beneficial to both parties. Simply saying "I'm unhappy, this job sucks, the freshies are wasting my time, blah...blah...blah..." only makes you look immature and unwilling to compromise. Humility is big here. Everyone, starts off a "beginner", but where you end up down the line in your career is largely a function of attitude, tolerance, and open communication. Anger/hate is baggage; life is too short to be pissed off all the time (+1 to those who know the reference), so actively and constructively communicate, you never know, you might end up actually liking your job after some adjustments. Good luck! 

A bit of context: I work in the Silicon Valley at a large, Big 4 corporation. I was involuntarily moved under a different manager without a reasonable amount of time of advance notice. Essentially, my former manager had bit off a little too much than he could chew; about a year ago, he ended up inheriting several new members and projects under him. His team grew to > 12 people with around 4 different projects happening at once. I had worked on the same project under my former manager for about a year. He decided a month ago that, in addition to other favorable projects he's been overseeing, the scope of the project I was working on was too large for him to manage. I never really had a great relationship with my former manager; I (in hindsight, mistakenly) told him that I was interested in exploring different opportunities internally. Effectively, he gave me a week's notice that I would be working under a different manager, and the project I was working on is now going to be owned by that manager. Now that manager is working under my former manager. So technically I got demoted. I'm not really too mad about being demoted, though I should be, but I'm more upset that I got moved under a different manager without any real discussion or consent. Simply put, I don't really like my new manager at all. His people skills suck and I'm starting to get annoyed more and more every day having to work for him. What's the best way to go about requesting a new manager entirely? Am I being naive? Is it feasible? It may mean moving to a different team, which I am okay with. I am thinking of talking to my former manager's manager instead because I feel like nothing will get done if I try to talk to my former manager. As a side note, I don't think I'm ever working corporate again. 

I'm a US citizen working for a top technology company in the Valley in California. Long story short, I've been working in a completely chaotic and toxic environment and am about ready to state my intent to resign at a future date. I don't want to waste any more time here than I already have, so I want to be out on the exact day that I receive my bonus. I'm thinking of informing my boss a month of advance, to give him and myself adequate time to transition out. The concern here is that I don't want to be "let go" earlier than my intended departure date. I'm thinking that it's not likely to happen, but I want to prepare myself for the worse, and re-adjust my strategy for how and when to transition out. So the question is: Is it legal, or common to be "let go" earlier than your intended departure date? Especially in situations where there is obvious tension between the two parties (employee and boss/management)? I understand that in most states in the US, employment is "at-will", so you can practically be let go for any reason, or not reason at all. But I'm wondering if someone has experienced something like this before, especially those who don't exactly have the best relationship with management.
