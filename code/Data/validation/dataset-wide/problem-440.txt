The living form is hotter than the air, and both end up closer to an intermediate temperature. Let's say the living form is 38 ºC (and producing heat) and the air is -10 ºC. At some time they may be at 35 ºC and the air at 0ºC, and if they continue to exchange heat to 32 ºC and 10 ºC, and so until both have the same temperature (the numbers are not necessarily realistic). This is not your scenario, because the air get hotter, not colder. The living form is colder than the air. Is the same thing, but the bodies are reverted. This looks more like your scenario, because the air get colder. But, the living form should be colder than the air previously, and end up hotter than before (but usually not hotter than the air). 

I don't think that what you are proposing is thermodynamically possible. If they are cooler than the air, yes, they can even absorb energy from the difference, and both end close to an intermediate temperature. But, if they are at the same temperature (or even worst, a higher one), they should spend energy in order to make the air cooler. They are fighting against the equilibrium tendency. So, if they are expelling the air cooler than before, they should spend another source of energy (like, chemical), and then get even hotter. That's why your air conditioning system spends electricity, instead of gaining it. 

This is a slight variant on the "Caribbean Island" theme. The problem with this is solution is that currents may bring to your island a random zombie. After 50 years spent far from the world, you are not prepared to deal with it. A possibly better solution is to find an island on a river. This has a few additional benefits: 

As far as we know, developing sapience is a rare thing. So having four races develop sapience at the same time seems highly unlikely. Therefore there common ancestor should have sapience. Now how would it look? Well as long as it keeps most of the traits common to all four races, that means that it is bipedal. However how much fur it would have is complicated given that we don't know where it lived. In any case knowing where this common ancestor lived could help. Maybe your four races then separated because they went and adapted to different climates? 

In Sci-fi, space fighters often look like exotic versions of fighter jets: wing shape is often different but the general shape is most of the time kept. However this seems unrealistic: the shape of fighter jets is almost always the same, because it is optimised for air-combat. In particular wings serve no purpose at all in space. What would a realistic space fighter look like? In terms of technology, I would like to stay as close as possible to what is possible today. 

I'd look at all sorts of coastal islands. Sea stacks, for example. There are plenty of naturally occurring islands out there that are inaccessible by boat. Typically due to: cliffs, reefs, and the sea itself (rough seas). Cliffs make it impractical to build infrastructure for shipping, but you are correct in that people could always build trails. So I don't think it's the cliff that are necessarily the key element. Just one of the barriers. The bigger barriers would be shallow sands (possibly fixed via dredging), rocks and reefs (possibly fixed via demolition), rough seas (possible fixed by building sea walls). All surmountable, of course, but typically highly impractical. If you look at the west coast of North America, you'll find a lot of of the coast is not easily accessible by large ships. Most ports are in fact inland (up river or within large bays). 

One thing the other answers miss is: pride. Building large, tall skyscrapers is very much about bragging. The pyramids weren't built for practical purposes. They were built as status symbols...as are most of the worlds 'tallest' buildings. Tall buildings are used as personal symbols (Rockefeller center), business symbols (Transamerica Building--later a symbol used by the city), and City symbols (1 World Trade Center). 

Edit: The basic shape of the harpoons would be something close to umbrellas, which would open once inside the ship. The "inside" of the umbrella would at pressure zero thanks to the hole you just made, and the "outside" would be at room pressure. The ribs can also help to reinforce the harpoon, much as the barbs of real-life harpoons. Concerning the air lock, the things you deploy have something like a corona-shape. Two more things I did not mention: 

The mathematical answer to that question is that you can define a manifold without embedding it into an n-dimensional vector-space. But this may be a bit too mathematical, so I will elaborate. The usual example is to look at the circle: if you live inside the circle, you can go forward (or backward) as much as you like and you will never find a boundary. You will tell me: "Yes, but when I look at the circle from the outside, I can see that there are boundaries." The reason why you think that is that you are used to see every object inside our usual 3-dimensional world. But mathematically speaking, there is nothing stopping a ring to exist "on its own", without a 3-dimensional space around it. Let's go up by one dimension. Let's say you live on a sphere. You can go as far as you want forward, backward, left or right. Once again there are no boundaries. The boundaries only exist if you try to embed the sphere into our usual 3-dimensional world. [Note that you can replace the sphere with a more complicated example (like a torus, or the surface of the Klein bottle) if you like.] What happens if I add again an other dimension? Well now you have what is called a 3-sphere. If you go in the same direction long enough you will end up in the same spot. If you have ever played Portal, you can imagine what it is like: get a big room, place portals on the floor, on the ceiling and on every wall and you obtain almost the same thing. Why do I say almost? Well by doing so you are using the fact that there are walls. However, just like in the sphere or the circle example, mathematically speaking you can define such a geometry without any reference to an outside world. About the distance problem: It can be confusing to talk about distance in such a geometry ("I walked 200km and I end up in the same spot. How can I be both 200km away and in the same spot?"). But if you think about it, we already are doing this every day. Indeed we are living on a sphere: Earth. The good thing is that the Earth is big enough that as long as we don't move much, it doesn't really matters if the Earth is round or flat, and distances make sense. However if you walk far enough (ie. 45 000 km) you do end up in the same place. 

They should be colder than air before they born, which implies some energy (same or much energy than absorbed). Where did that energy come from? Eventually they reach air temperature, and can not exchange temperature anymore. 

So, in a strict definition, the wormhole is the point where ever two portions touch. And there is no meaning of "inside" if you talk about a point. But, in a practical way, you'll perceive anomalies in the proximity of the worm hole. Because the space-time around it would be so much bended. But that space-time is the same that was before the wormhole exists. And it is filled originally with the same things that were before, and later with that plus what enters, minus what exists, cross what to mate in the proximity (that depends on the theory and the characteristics is the wormhole). See this simulation for a possibility: $URL$ 

First, you should think about the evolution of the species along with technology. They probably don't make fire as a primitive technology. Do they have hands? Tentacles? Which materials and tools they have? Then, they could be manufactured using living beings or their parts, as I propose in this answer. 

Similar to what @si42 said, it depends on how you define organism. You can take as example the model of abiogenesis (origin of life from non-living matter) proposed by the Nobel biologist Jack Szostak. The model was CONFIRMED to be possible and capable of originate life. That it actually did it on Earth or some other place is another question. The model works with replicating micelles and vesicles, one of the papers says: 

Make it controlled. Nuclear reactors are controlled nuclear reactions. They're controlled to the point where there is no explosion. A nuclear bomb is an uncontrolled nuclear reaction. I'm likely stretching physics here, but one could perhaps have an incredibly tiny amount of fissionable material and then control it with a really tiny reactor (nano-sized rods?) 

I don't know if this future is a whole lot different than what we have now in terms of general human behavior. Lots of humans live in very close proximity to each other without major (ie, population-level) destruction. Most 'postal' types of incidents are usually somewhat targeted and aren't necessarily out to destroy a whole city, for instance. Granted if any one person could destroy the entirety of civilization would someone attempt it? Probably. But we'd have to get to that point first, and I would imagine that we'd see that coming and some form of checks and balances would hopefully detour any such finality. As to whether these humans could remain human...that seems like an entirely different question and I'm not sure how it'd directly relate to access to energy. 

For starters, 'on par'--in the real world--is a misleading concept when comparing the societies. The America's had elaborate advanced societies as well. They were just different. The other big thing to note is that 1600's Europe was a society that formed from a long history of interacting with many other very diverse societies. So had Europe been left to their own devices, they never would have achieved the 1600's Europe that came to be. As such, hypothetically, it's doubtful that more isolated societies would advance the same way as societies with a lot of interaction with other societies. Even if both societies had access to the same types of diverse other societies, advancements would likely not mirror each other due to pure randomness. The reason we have different cultures is because of that. 

I'm not sure if this is a complete answer but here is my 2-cent: The first thing to note is that the problem isn't really if a Man can grasp a 3-dimensional situation, but if he can deal with it better than an AI. That heavily depends on how advanced AI are. The second one is that you could have multiple men in one space fighter to deal with some shortcommings, a bit like un the B52. 

Well according to wikipedia, the first microscope was made between the 1200's and 1600, so actually the middle ages are not that far off. You can also look at this page $URL$ which links to the book [*], which may probably answer all of your questions. About the fact of finding germs, it is said once again on wikipedia that the first bacteria was found in the 1600s thanks to a "single-lens microscope". So I assume that as soon as you have a basic microscope and that you look in the right direction, you can actually find germs. [*]: Bardell, D. 2004. “The Invention of the Microscope”. 

A quick google search lets you find even more results. So in a sense, we already are hybrids. Note that is not just us: any two species have genes in common. There are two reasons for that: one is that we all share a common ancestor. The other is that horizontal gene transfer seems to be a thing. 

Species that are adept at changing environments and opportunistic in terms of leveraging human environments will thrive. Others will not. While not urban-centric, the PBS documentary on Dogs talks about one particular species that has thrived with humans: $URL$ 

Plenty of species already evolve with us in urban environments (at least 'evolve' in the sense that they thrive and benefit from the urban environment). 

I think you can buy your way towards preparing for the apocalypse. But like you say, once it comes, money isn't worth much. So the entire 'buying' part has to happen pre-apocalypse. Once it happens, money will likely be less useful than brute strength...weapons, bunkers, etc. That said, there would likely still be valuable commodities (such as fuel ala Mad Max). So perhaps part of the preparation is to transfer one's monetary wealth into commodity wealth for post apocalyptic trade economies. 

This is a thought provoker! But, since we're talking about stories, my mind immediately jumped to the 'gotchas' that would make forming a society difficult. Would people still work? If each day was a repeat, would there be a compelling reason to clock in each morning at McDonalds to cook for people? Would a bus driver bother getting the bus going? Why plow the snow if tomorrow is the same? Would basic infrastructure be working? Would anyone bother to reboot the web server for the day? Change that lightbulb? Or, perhaps the bigger issue...would anyone that works for the power company bother to go into work to actually provide power for the day? I'm thinking that would all fall apart pretty quickly. The next question would be...would it return? If everyone remembers each same day from day to day, perhaps verbal agreements could be made. Joe, you come in 'tomorrow' and fire up the generators. Bob will come in the 'day after' that. Then Sam. So, initially, people may go the free-for-all route. But that can get old. And at some point, humanity may wish for a semblance of routine and return to the routine and start going back to work to bring back a bit of order. The success/failure of that may be varied from locale to locale but, over time, if enough regions leave the power on, and the cable on, word can spread. If all of that succeeds, one scenario is a form of Utopia. No one gets older. Everyone works minimally (only infrastructure and service jobs are really needed). And there's plenty of time for leisure. Everything is free (as why bother with money for a day?) There is a catch, though, and that, of course, is that society somewhat stagnates as there's no way to record information for the next day. It all has to be stored and shared verbally. Day by day. That might slow down the progress of human knowledge significantly. On the other hand, with each day a repeat, and all that leisure time, perhaps word of mouth is ideal and we all slowly learn all of the things we never had time to before. There would be casualties, though. As others have pointed out, for most people, this would be a nice way to spend each day. But for anyone that is suffering at any level, this could be a nightmare. If you in your last days of a painful disease, or are injured every day in the first 10 seconds. Or simply depressed. Having to spend every day in agony over and over will surely create despair. Or those that are alone somewhere without an easy way back to civilization within 24 hours. Being alone for the rest of your life could drive someone insane.
