Just compare the year 1616 of the Manimekalai with that of the 80,000 year life span of a person at the time of the next Buddha. Does it make any sense for a 80,000 year old person to be living in the year 1616? I know well that this answer will be deleted with the reasoning that this does not answer the OP’s specific question. It seems like satisfying the OP is more important that Stream Entry (the state of Sotapanna) for this site, and that’s the very reason that people like Yuttadhammo Thero stay away. Well in getting back to the subject of 80,000 years, you may now wonder whether there would be enough food for all if people are to live for 80,000 years. But it will not be so, as even in the past Kalpas (Aeons) people have lived for that long as per Buddha. Buddha once said, 

Now that you have got your answer in the earlier post by Dhammadhatu, let me give you this little story from Supreme Buddha's life. How He recognized and overcame these to attain nibbana. Supreme Buddha admits His past wanderings in existence which entailed suffering, a fact that evidently proves the belief in rebirth. He was compelled to wander and consequently to suffer, as He could not discover the Master Builder that built this house, the body. In His final birth, while engaged in solitary meditation which He had highly developed in the course of His wanderings, after a relentless search He discovered by His own intuitive wisdom the elusive Master Builder, residing not outside but within the recesses of His own heart. It was craving or attachment, a self-creation, a mental element latent in all. How and when this craving originated is incomprehensible. What is created by oneself can be destroyed by oneself. The discovery of the builder/architect is the eradication of craving by attaining Arhantship (perfect one), which in these verses is alluded to as “end of craving.” The rafters of this self-created house are the passions (kilesa) such as attachment (lobha) aversion (dosa), illusion (moha), conceit (māna), false views (ditthi), doubt (vicikicchā), sloth (thīna), restlessness (uddhacca), moral shamelessness (ahirika), moral fearlessness (anottappa). The ridgepole that supports the rafters represents ignorance, the root cause of all passions. The shattering of the ridge-pole of ignorance by wisdom results in the complete demolition of the house. The ridge-pole and rafters are the material with which the builder/architect builds this undesired house. With their destruction the builder/architect is deprived of the material to rebuild the house which is not wanted. With the demolition of the house the mind, for which there is no place in the analogy, attains the unconditioned state, which is Nibbāna. Whatever that is mundane is left behind, and only the Supramundane State, Nibbāna, remains. 

A concentrated monk discerns things as they actually are… Lets try to understand the importance of a concentrated mind. A mind that is not concentrated creates a lot of heat. A defiled or wayward mind creates actions that lead to “heat” or “thäpa” in us in the longer term. Long after that “initial satisfaction” gained by such actions, if for instance it is one of aversion, one will be “burning inside” for long times, even if one does not realize that. Removal of this thäpa or “fire” in us is what is meant by the phrase “athäpi sampajano” in the Satipattana Sutta. That will in the case of aversion, help reduce our tendency get “worked up” at the slightest provocation, i.e., to change our 'gathi' in the right direction. Just as angry thoughts unleash a high degree of heat which results in feelings filled with suffering, when the mind attains the state of Samadhi (concentration), the mind releases low intense heat, resulting in peaceful, happy feelings. What is important in this state of mind is the clarity of mind. Such a state helps to cultivate a clear, unbiased mind. The mind maintains an unbiased, calm state which is devoid of attachment and hostility. In other words, this is the state of Samadhi (concentration) which gives rise to a clear vision. A concentrated person is able to view the truth, depending on the degree of wisdom gained by Samadhi. Let us take for example, a concentrated person (meditator) practicing dhatu manasikara (reflection of elements). When this is practiced in a practical way, a meditator ought to have developed a stable mental state where he could perceive his respiration very clearly. In other words, the meditator needs a strong Samadhi (concentration) to accomplish the practice of dhatu manasikara. The meditator who contemplates the mental phenomena with a strong mindfulness based on Samadhi, would perceive the changes in the mind on the basis of ‘dhatu manasikara’. Accordingly, the meditator perceives two types of consciousness within the mind. First is the consciousness produced as a result of amplification of ‘pathavi’ effect. Second is the consciousness produced by diminishing effect of ‘pathavi’ element. The mediator keeps identifying and analyzing these two types of consciousness during the course of the dhatu manasikara practice. Now, this is his primary aspect of meditation. The meditator who experiences a blissful mental state, now, begins to catch the first glimpse of the transient nature (anicca) of the mind, the inability to maintain anything to ones liking, the repeated arising/destruction of all things, and thus the worthlessness of worldly things. He begins to observe the changes that take place even in the blissful mental states. He perceives slight differences of bliss he experiences during Samadhi states which give rise to the understanding of the characteristic of dhukka (altering the current state and transforming to a different state) inherent even in blissful mental states. Thus, a meditator begins to realize, for the first time, the characteristics of anicca the transient nature and the inability to maintain anything to ones liking, dukkha (alter & transform nature) and anatta (no-self) as one who is trying to find refuge in this world will become truly helpless in the long run. This is first hand wisdom that one gains when one is concentrated and through the reflection of one’s mind. This is the positive outcome or gain that a meditator achieves through the practice of dhatu manasikara while in a concentrated state of mind. Mere discussions aimed at the characteristics of anicca, dukkha and anatta or reciting the nature of anicca, dukkha, and anatta would not bring any fruitful benefits to an individual. One needs to realize the nature and characteristics pertaining to anicca, dukkha and anatta through a direct reflection of one’s mind based on the meditation techniques prescribed by the Buddha while in a concentrated state of mind. That is the only approach for an individual to attain Nibbana. 

Sutta-vinaya is your ultimate teacher. It is found in the books written by Bhikkhu Bodhi. Bhikkhu Bodhi is an American Buddhist monk from New York City. Ven. Bodhi has many important publications such as: A Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya , The Connected Discourses of the Buddha — a New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya , In the Buddha’s Words (An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon), Great Disciples of the Buddha: Their Lives, Their Works, Their Legacy.. to name a few. As Buddhists, we should be familiar with the Suttas and if possible obtain our own copies. It is a sad fact that only we Buddhists who would not go to the original source for guidance. Do you find Muslims without the Quran or Christians without the Bible? It is only we Buddhists who are without the Nikáyas. Having said that still it is very important to have a ‘Kalyana Mitta (a noble friend), as it is much more important than all else for one who wants to walk this road less travelled. It is even more important than one’s developed morality (Sila). Then that Noble Friend protects you from your own mind, until you are well established in the path. Mind is a strange thing. It is always out to find others faults, and to justify your own thinking and actions. It is your Teacher, who could remind you now and then of this. A sense of 'hiri-ottappa' accompanied by mindfulness is to reflect on oneself only, and never let your mind to compare it to others (Hiri is an innate sense of shame over moral transgression; ottappa is moral dread, fear of the results of wrongdoing). Every time you do so, you get thrown away from this path. It is because of this mind, because of us trusting this mind that we never even now see the danger of Samsara, and we are forever in it. Thankfully I have such a noble friend. One can have only one or two such, the most. Otherwise you give into your mind again, and it decided what advice to take, and what to reject or ignore. So I do hope that you will find another Teacher close to you. The most important thing to understand the Dhamma is to remember what is heard or read. Then follows the examination of the meanings of what is remembered. We tend not to do that. Just having a collection of books, or notes in the computer will not do. The process of learning the Dhamma goes through the stages of listening, remembering, constant reciting, mental observation and ideological understanding of the Dhamma. As per the scriptures, the self-study of Dhamma should thus have the following components: Methodology of learning
