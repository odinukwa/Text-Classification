The problem is that the intensity of the reflection will fall off as $\frac 1 {r^2}$, which means it's very unlikely you'll get even single photons returning from Mars. So you could not form an image from such a "reflection" or realistically receive data from a reflection from another planet. And remember that this reflection has to be distinguished from the light Mars itself is reflecting from it's surface. And the light from Mars would swamp any reflected light from Earth. So this is physically unrealistic. 

Groan. Why can't you just have a plain old-fashioned genetic mutation ? Once you start using magic to solve problems it becomes arbitrary and you loose any constraints, because if magic could solve the problem once, it can solve another problem. 

You have a misconception about this. There's a very approximate quantity known as the effective temperature which is a rough estimate of planetary temperature (ignoring atmosphere and rotation effects) which tells us that : $$T_{eff}\propto \frac 1 {\sqrt R}$$ where $T_{eff}$ is temperature and $R$ is distance from the star. Now $R$ is very large compared to the size of a planet ( if you want an inhabited planet ) and this means the difference between $R$ at the near side and $R$ at the far side is minute. You won't gain any temperature difference like this, it's too small an effect. 

OK, you can pick off the less experienced ones easier. They'll make mistakes, they'll panic in combat - everyone does sometime. 

So we designed it with goals that conflict with ours ? This is why I always say the marketing department should not be allowed to decide project specifications - leave it to engineers. :-) The way you control an AI is to require all it's command and control functionality to pass through human controlled analysis first. The slightest hint that it's formed it's own goals that conflict with ours and the nuke goes off. Only someone who hasn't see Terminator would let an AI control even the coffee machine directly. 

Historical evidence would suggest this is not possible. AFAIK every single human civilization has evolved a belief system and an associated religion (and often more than one) as part of the process of becoming civilized. It appears to be a foundational step for organized large scale societies. One of the primary roles of organized religion has been basically governmental. They define what's acceptable social behavior, what is a crime and what is not, what is a reasonable punishment and what is not. They form a framework for the development of more sophisticated (but not necessarily better) forms of control. 

OK, you probably think this is useful for gliding creatures, but in practical terms it's probably the opposite of what is needed. In flight, wind currents and turbulence are going to generate significant forces and super-sensitive skin and fur would probably swamp the nervous system. Factor in temperature effects (e.g., wind chill) and I'd suggest you don't really want to have very sensitive exteriors on your gliding creatures. Finally : 

I don't see how you could counterfeit a living currency. We can't counterfeit a rat in a laboratory now. 

You actually suggest they don't mix socially normally, so there are no repercussions unless they compete with us. Mixed breeding would complicate that as a significant minority of humans don't tend to react well to even slight differences between people. So initially a lot of racial tension and possibly violence on a small and large scale. As things develop, probably a tendency for increasing integration as the two sub-species develop a happy middle ground. 

Short Version : a Bren Carrier type vehicle. Urban environments are not good places for tanks. In your low gee world they become a worse place for tanks. The tank is vulnerable in urban situations because it's relatively easy for infantry armed with anti-tank weapons to sneak up close enough to get a clean shot and disappear again leaving one disabled or destroyed tank. In your low gee world the infantry can carry more gear including more anti-tank gear. They are a bigger threat than they were. In general what infantry need in urban areas is a low key (low silhouette) compact vehicle capable of traversing difficult terrain and acting as a tractor or similar when needed. A little armor is useful for small arms fire protection, but not particularly useful otherwise. Some light weaponry (machine guns) would be sufficient. They need a vehicle capable of rapidly moving them and operating as a fast taxi and resupply support. Something that can carry mens, ammunition, wounded to and from the fighting to support areas. It's not unusual for such vehicles to have winching capability and carry comms gear. 

You cannot suck something in a vacuum. There's nothing to suck. You can't create an inflow of gases by sucking which would drag other things with it. 

Punishments that permanently disable or main (or kill) will reduce the effective survivability of the whole group. They would be the very last choice for a Dictator wanting to insure a successful mission. Speaking with my mad dictator hat on, I'd ensure a very low requirement for such measures by simply using the right psychological selection methods for candidates in the first place. I'd pick well motivated and loyal people with my own outlook. They'd be "trained" more before the mission (i.e. really brain-washed). You'd send fanatics who needed no discipline. So probably you'd limit punishment to the "pain-booth" type. Perhaps flogging, although this risks permanent injury. Maybe electric shock as a punishment would be better suited to the mission goals. Psychological monitoring and perhaps psychological methods as torture would be an option. You'd be amazed (well, alarmed) by what a week in total isolation and/or the dark can do to a human. Zero-G is, I think, an unrealistic restriction. In practical terms any long journey in space will need to provide some emulation of gravitation forces simply to maintain body functions. It seems unlikely from current knowledge that the human body could be maintained in a healthy state for a long journey at zero G. As your goal is colonization they would also need to be adapted to a real gravitational force before being able to carry out the mission. That requires some functionality in your ship to help maintain a "gravity-matched" body. Some sort of centrifuge-like device is therefore a likely thing to at least provide some place for exercise. It seems a likely place for medical procedures as well, so presumably that would encompass your more grisly choices of punishment if required. Actually carrying out such procedures in zero-G really just amounts to the same task as Earth but with some system for gathering fluids. A table with a lot of carefully designed airflow and suction pumps might do the job. That said, does this maniac dictator actually want a tidy job. Tortures are most effective when the people you want kept in line have to endure the misery to some extent. Being forced to watch and listen in a chamber where the bodily fluids from the victim float around and can come into contact with you (and perhaps body parts too) would strike me as a pretty gruesome way to send the message to the survivors. In this scenario, the execution just needs a suit to keep him/her self clear enough of debris and fluids to see what they're doing.
