This compilation of articles on the subject goes into a lot of depth and sources some examples and opinions of some very notable cyclists themselves. $URL$ 

Just about any new bike you ever purchase will need a good tune up after the first 100 miles, not unlike a lot of cars or motorcycles. It's perfectly normal for most of the parts, especially parts under tension like brakes and cables, to settle and loosen a bit the first few times you ride the bike. It's likely that the cable for the rear shifter has loosened a little bit and needs to be tightened, or the limit screw has settled. The shop you bought the bike from should have no problem performing the tune up for you, it's very common practice ( and if they try to charge you for it, hesitate to give them your business, the 100 mile tune-up should be complimentary ). 

Why do chain wear indicators have an indication for 0.5% wear and one for 0.75% wear? Are both measurements included because there is some personal preference from mechanic to mechanic, or rather are there separate uses for each? I find myself asking this because right now I have a chain that measures at least .5% but less than .75% and I want to replace it before it negatively impacts the cassette teeth. For what it's worth, it's an 11 speed chain. 

Wheels eventually do simply wear out, but we're usually talking tens of thousands of kilometers or at least several years for the average user. If it's been less than a year, you shouldn't expect to have to dish out any money for this repair. I believe those wheels typically have a two year warranty. If you bought the wheels at a shop, the shop should handle the warranty repair or replacement for you ( or else it's about time to find a different shop ). Sometimes they're a little grumpy about it since there's a small possibility you didn't take good care of the wheel, but you shouldn't have too much trouble if you're polite. tl;dr: Wheels should not wear out this fast, these should be replaced or repaired under warranty. 

Get some clipless pedals. Then, practice until you feel like you've been practicing all day, then practice some more. Continue to practice until you're successful. 

Trials bikes were originally just mountain bikes, at the time most mountain bikes had 26" inch wheels and 135mm rear dropouts (trials is basically shorthand for mountain bike trials). Trials bikes of this design usually fall into the "stock" category. When people started modifying bikes to be even more well suited for obstacle courses, the 20" wheels and 116mm rear dropouts were introduced, this is when the bikes started to closely resemble bmx bikes. Trials bikes of this design usually fall into the "mod" category. "Stock" bikes and "mod" bikes make up the two officially recognized categories of trials bikes, so, plan for 20" wheels or 26" wheels. The 20s are generally more nimble but the the argument for 26s is probably more clearance and better balance. There's quite a bit more information on the subject: $URL$ $URL$ 

If you've got spokes that keep breaking, either the wheel was originally built poorly or the wheel just isn't strong enough ( poor quality materials to begin with, etc ). The cost of having a professional take the time and care to properly re-tension all of the spokes and get the wheel in shape might be prohibitive, and theres a chance it might not solve your problem for good. You may save yourself some time money and effort by just getting a stronger higher quality wheel. 

If you throw some studs on those XC 30s ( don't skip that step ) you'll have plenty of grip and all around performance. Unless you travel into some higher price ranges where the really aggressive tread patterns usually live, you'll be hard pressed to find too much of a difference between MTB shoes and cross shoes. If you end up in love with racing cross, you'll start to get a good handle on which equipment works best for you. 

If bike-one has an aluminum frame and only the components were damaged, your LBS's assertion that it is 'ok' seems to be accurate, there's a good chance it could be ridden safely. But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be replaced. Like you said, it sustained quite an impact, it was clearly damaged, and I don't like the look of that cracked paint behind the front brake. You should push to have it replaced. 

Your most practical solution here would be to cook almost anything you wanted ahead of time and carry it in a stanley thermos or a similarly durable insulated carrier. There is a good reason that you have never seen anyone cooking food while riding a bike before, it's not safe or practical. 

What you're witnessing is probably a mixture of convenience and all-around-increased popularity of fat bikes, rather than actual 'benefits' A lot of people don't have the luxury of owning multiple bikes: one for the road, one for grocery trips, one for cross country, etc. If someone only has the resources for one bike, and they chose a fat bike because they like the versatility, you can understand why they would take that bike to the store. It's easy to argue that a fat-bike can go off-road, on the snow and sand, and of course to the store. A road bike cannot do all of that. Also, wide tires are generally more comfortable. I could shed some weight and increase my speed a little by running ~30mm tires, but I choose to run 40mm tires most weeks because they handle bumpy roads and gravel with comfort and ease. 

You're an exceptionally experienced programmer, you know by now that life is a series of compromises and trade offs. Yes the diamondback is a good bike for that price, but you get what you pay for. If you really want a bicycle you'll enjoy, go to a family owned local bike shop and trade a little extra money for an experienced employee to fit you to a bike that's just right for you. 

Avid recommends breaking those discs and pads in with about 30 or 40 deliberately hard stops in order to build up a good foundation. If you've gone through that process a couple of times and still no dice, there could be brake fluid on the discs or pads. Some water or isopropyl alcohol should take care of that. 

Whether or not you used the wrong lubricant depends a lot on just which lubricant you used... A large load bearing joint like that deserves some teflon grease or some pedro's grease, I don't think regular lubricant is going to cut it here. Head to your LBS and ask what type of grease they have for you and how much to apply ( it shouldn't take much ). 

If money is of little consequence, by all means, acquire an electric bike for your work commute and keep your current bicycle as it is. The electric bike is more likely to have a longer lasting battery and integrated controls. The conversion kit on the other hand, will be less expensive and could probably be swapped between multiple bikes. It seems like a generally more convenient route. 

It's surprising that this is as hot a topic as it is. Clipless pedals are more efficient, and you can get stiffer shoes for them. Competitor or not, if you step foot into clipless pedals I think you will notice the difference. Go take a pair for a test ride and you will probably favor the increased control, especially if you ride longer distances. Perhaps the main downside that can't be overcome one way or another, is the increased cost. As for that infamous argument about whether or not you can produce more power, hopefully we will have enough real world data to bring the argument to rest. 

It's hard for us to speak with any certainty about your particular bike that's halfway around the earth. However, it doesn't sound like you'll be able to do it, 700c wheels are 29" in diameter and your wheels are 28.5" in diameter, so they may or may not be half an inch too big. 

Your assumptions are right on, the carbon fiber stays are definitely our biggest obstacle. They prevent you from being able to powder coat the aluminum, the risk of damaging the carbon fiber from heat in the process is too great. A professional in town should be able to properly mask the carbon fiber and sandblast or glass bead blast the aluminum. I believe glass bead blasting is the preferred option and is supposed to be gentler. Then comes the new paint job. As usual, Sheldon has quite a bit of information on the subject: $URL$ 

I'd wager the two biggest reasons you don't see foot-sized pedals are the increased rotational weight, and the difficulty you would have catching the pedal with your foot before it struck the ground or the front tire. I'm sure someone tried this once and promptly scrapped the idea after the foot-sized pedal struck something. Pedals need to be stiff and durable, which is fine. But if pedals had to be stiff and durable and large, they would probably end up being heavy, so it makes sense that most pedals you see are small and compact. Shoes already do a great job of interfacing with and conforming to your feet, and it's easy enough to make the sole stiff with plastic, fiberglass, and carbon fiber. All of these factors combined explain why we have small pedals. 

You've got a 'stretched' chain that needs to be replaced. If the chain has been in this condition for some time, and I suspect it has, I always recommend replacing the cassette at the same time. The reason being that a worn chain wears down the cassette and a new, unworn chain, will fit the old worn cassette poorly and the skipping will continue. I had to learn this the hard way, with multiple trips to the bike shop. As usual, Sheldon has already laid the issue out in depth: $URL$ 

Kibbee is on to something, your tire is your best defense against punctures no matter the terrain. Try using Continental Trail King tires or Continental Mountain King tires and you will surely see a decrease in punctures. Most tubes will hold up the same, if I had to pick one I'd say go with a continental tube or stick with the slime tubes. 

As mattnz hinted at in the related question, not all hydraulic brakes are necessarily going to perform better than cable brakes, and it looks like you've hit that nail on the head with this comparison. The Stroker Rydes are well known to be painfully poor quality. You would have absolutely no reason not to choose the BB7s in this case. 

I'd be concerned if you you were hooking your trusty XC bike up to a public rack that looked like that, not only would it be nearly impossible to secure your frame to it but I'd fear someone would come along and indeed damage something, even unintentionally while wrestling their bike free from the same rack. But at home? It depends on how long you plan to leave it there or whether or not it's actually leaning on just a spoke or two. One night at a time? Probably not worth worrying about. Leaving it there for an entire season or two? I probably would skip the risk by leaning it against a wall in a safe spot. 

I love a good drop bar, but if you're only going 4 miles, an upright position might be more comfortable for you, especially if you're starting to commute for the first time. Start with your basic commuter bike if you want, something that looks like this, with some flat handle bars. $URL$ Head to a bike shop where you can test drive some different models, maybe you even end up liking the drop bars more. Especially if you have some hills in your way on your commute. 

There are a lot of variables to consider here, you can't really compare two bikes and declare that all full suspension bikes are £1000 more. That's like comparing apples to oranges, every model of bike is unique and comes with different components. Components are going to account for big ranges in price. That said, generally, full suspension frames are more complex, require more parts, and are more costly to design and manufacture. $URL$
