If the first square in row $i$ has side $1/{n_i}$, then $n_0=3$ and $n_{i+1}=\lfloor \frac{3}{2}n_i\rfloor$. But then the total height of the first seven rows is already $$\frac 13 + \frac 14 + \frac 16 + \frac 19 + \frac 1{13} + \frac 1{19} + \frac 1 {28} > 1.$$ On the other hand this arrangement is not optimal, since the sixth row has squares $\frac 1{19}, \dots, \frac 1{27}$ but we could fit up to $\frac 1{30}$. So perhaps the claim is still true, notwithstanding the unconvincing proof? 

Notice that this implies reflexivity (take $T$ to be a singleton); totality (by existence of the least element of a two-element set); and antisymmetry (by uniqueness of the least element of a two-element set). So it’s equivalent to the usual definition. And it is certainly memorable! But I doubt I would have understood it if I wasn’t already familiar with the usual definition. 

For the record, this question is answered in a pair of papers: Gábor V. Nagy, A combinatorial proof of Shapiroʼs Catalan convolution, In Advances in Applied Mathematics, Volume 49, Issues 3–5, 2012, Pages 391-396 Péter Hajnal and Gábor V. Nagy. A Bijective Proof of Shapiro’s Catalan Convolution. Electronic Journal of Combinatorics, 21(2), 2014 In particular Lemma 7 of the first paper is, I think, a satisfactory answer to this question. The second paper gives a fully bijective proof. Thanks to Richard Stanley. 

Added: Thanks to David E Speyer for a clear concise answer. Just to make it explicit, the “non-uniformity” at play here is that each prime factor of $\Phi_d(x)$ is congruent to 1 modulo $d$. 

The celebrated Big Theorem of Picard's is that, in every open set containing an essential singularity of a function $f(z)$, $f(z)$ takes on every value (except for at most one) of $\mathbb{C}$ infinitely often. Now - is the converse true? Is this a way to characterize the existence of an essential singularity of a function? For example, if you're given a non-constant function $f(z)$ that is holomorphic on some open set $\Omega$, and you know that there is an accumulation of 0's towards some point $x$ on the boundary of $\Omega$, then do you know that there must be an essential singularity at $x$? 

Let $F$ be a finite field. Let $F[X]$ and $F[[X]]$ denote the ring of polynomials and power series over $F$, respectively. I'm trying to show a statement like the following: Fix a $d > 0$. Let $g\in F[[X]]$. If there exists a set $C\subseteq F[X]$ of polynomials (with no constant term) of degree at most $k$ such that for all $c\in C$, $g(c)$ -- $g$ composed with $c$ -- is a degree $kd$ polynomial, and $|C|$ is "large" (some function of $k$, $d$, and $|F|$), then $g$ must actually be a polynomial. I'm trying to beat the bound that one might be able to get via Schwartz-Zippel, where $|C| > kd |F|^{k-1}$ (where $kd \ll |F|$). What bounds on $|C|$ can we get? Thank you, Henry 

Picard's Big Theorem says that if a function $f(z)$ has an isolated essential singularity at a point $w$, then in every neighborhood of $w$, $f(z)$ hits every complex number infinitely many times, with perhaps at most one exception. Is there a version of Picard's theorem that goes something like this? Let $V$ be an open disc (finite radius) such that $f(z)$ is holomorphic on $V - \lbrace w \rbrace$, and has an essential singularity at $w$. Let $0 \leq \theta < \phi < 2\pi$, and define $Cone(w,V,\theta,\phi)$ to be $V \cap \lbrace w + re^{i\varphi} \mid r > 0, \theta < \varphi < \phi \rbrace$. Think of this as a "pizza slice" of the disc $V$. Is it true that there exists an $\alpha$ such that $f(z) = \alpha$ for infinitely many $z\in Cone(w,V,\theta,\phi)$? 

What a great question. I’m sure there will be many lovely examples. Here is one I stumbled on last year which seems to fit. I saw an online demonstration of a simulated annealing algorithm for the following problem: a digital photograph has been “shredded” by randomly shuffling the columns of pixels, and we wish to recover the original unshredded image. Here is such a shredded photograph. 

This is still a hard problem (#P-complete), so it almost certainly can’t be done in polynomial time. See Valiant, L. G. (1979). The Complexity of Enumeration and Reliability Problems. SIAM J. Comput., 8, 410-421. As for the other part of your question, I wonder if you’ve fallen prey to some terminological confusion. It seems clear that what you’re interested in is counting all the simple paths – paths that visit each node at most once – between two nodes. Multiplying adjacency matrices gives you something different: it counts all the paths, including non-simple ones that may double back on themselves or go round a loop. 

I expected a flood of responses to this question, since there are so many lovely examples. That flood does not seem to have materialised yet, so let me add an old classic. I hope it isn’t too famous to be worth mentioning, and that adding it as a separate answer is the correct protocol. I’m thinking of Steve Fisk’s celebrated proof of the Art Gallery theorem, which is in the form of an algorithm. We are given the floor plan of an art gallery as a simple polygon in the plane with $n$ vertices, and we wish to place some (motionless point) guards into the polygon so that the whole of the interior of the polygon is visible to at least one guard. We can see that we may need as many as $\lfloor\frac n3\rfloor$ guards by considering comb-shaped polygons with $n=3k$ vertices: 

Except for the finitely many fields where nontrivial roots of unity are present, the fundamental unit $\varepsilon$ of the quadratic subfield $k$ is the norm of a unit from $K$ if and only if $K = k(\sqrt{\pm \varepsilon})$. If $N(\varepsilon) = +1$, then $K$ is biquadratic, and if $N(\varepsilon) = -1$, then $K$ is not CM (by simple Galois theory). Thus the fundamental unit in $K$ is the same as in $k$ in your cases, and you have $r = 1$ if and only if $N(\varepsilon) = -1$. In this case, $k$ has the form $k = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{t^2+4})$ for trivial reasons: write $\varepsilon = (T + U \sqrt{m})/2$; then $T^2 - mU^2 = -4$, hence $T^2 + 4 = mU^2$ and ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{m}\,) = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{mU^2}\,) = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{T^2+4}\,)$. But I would not regard this as a classification. 

In his solution of the equation $x^3 + dy^3 = 1$, Nagell comes across the equation $$ u^3 + 6u^2v + 3uv^2 - v^3 = w^3. $$ He then observes that $$ (u^3 + 6u^2v + 3uv^2 - v^3) U^3 = V^3 + W^3 $$ for $$ U = u^2+uv+v^2, \quad V = u^3+3u^2v-v^3, \quad W = 3u^2v+3uv^2, $$ and then appeals to Fermat's Last Theorem for the exponent $3$. My question: what is known about representing a binary cubic form $$ au^3 + bu^2v + cuv^2 + dv^3 $$ as a sum of two rational cubes in the polynomial ring ${\mathbb Z}[u,v]$? Where is Nagell's solution coming from? P.S. Dehomogenizing by setting $v = 1$ gives us an elliptic surface. Still I wonder how Nagell dreamed up his solution. 

Incidentally, the reason I was familiar with TSP-solving technology is that I had used it earlier to disprove a 20-year-old conjecture in combinatorics: another problem that doesn’t sound like graph theory at first blush. 

Is anything known about any of the following questions about rational points on the unit circle? By “double point” I mean an element of $2C$, where $C$ is the group of rational points on the unit circle (i.e. Gaussian rationals with unit modulus, under multiplication). 

The number of $n$-step NSEW lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(a,b)$ that intersect the line $y=k$ precisely $t$ times is independent of $k$, for $0\leq k\leq b$, where we assume $b\geq0$ for simplicity. This is easy to show by exhibiting an involution on the set of $n$-step NSEW paths from $(0,0)$ to $(a,b)$: for $0\leq k<k'\leq b$, take the portion of the path from the first intersection with $y=k$ to the last intersection with $y=k'$, and rotate it by 180°. This exchanges intersections with $y=k$ and intersections with $y=k'$. This seems to be quite a useful symmetry. For example it leads to a nice combinatorial interpretation of the “Andrews-Paule identity” $$\sum_{i=0}^n\sum_{j=0}^n{i+j\choose j}^2{4n-2i-2j\choose 2n-2i}=(2n+1){2n\choose n}^2$$ I imagine it is a well-known fact, but I’m not sure where to look. Perhaps it is known in the context of the 2D random walk? I’d be grateful for any suggestions or (even better) references. 

The answer is yes. Thanks to the comment by Yoav Kallus above, and a comment by Timothy Chow on the question he linked to, I found the paper An algorithm for packing squares by Marc M. Paulhus. (Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A, Volume 82, Issue 2, 1998, Pages 147-157) Lemma 1 of that paper shows: All the reciprocal squares from n to infinity can be packed in a rectangle of length $l$ and width $w$ provided $$n\geq \frac{1+l}{wl}$$ With $l=1/2$ and $w=1$, this shows that we could place the square of side 1/2 in such a way that the remaining space is a rectangle of dimensions 1 x 1/2, and then pack the remaining squares into that rectangle using Paulhus's procedure. It doesn't obviously answer the question of whether the packing could be completed if started as shown. In particular, can the squares of side 1/3, 1/4, etc. be packed into two unconnected squares of side 1/2? 

I love the following example: approximating pi. Ask a person to come up with a relatively efficient algorithm to compute the digits of pi, and unless they already know some math, most will draw a blank. Here's something that anybody with a basic geometry background will understand: Simply generate many random 2D points (x,y) in the box [-1,1]x[-1,1], and count the number of points within distance 1 of 0 (call this number A) and the number of points in the box total (call this number T). You can then approximate pi with $\pi r^2 /4r^2 \approx A/T$, but $r=1$, so $\pi \approx 4A/T$. 

Let $G$ be an Abelian group. Let $A \subseteq G$. In additive combinatorics, one of the primary measures of the additive structure of $A$ is its additive energy, defined as $E(A) = |\lbrace(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4) \in A^4 : a_1 + a_2 = a_3 + a_4 \rbrace|$. A related quantity that I'm interested in is: $F(A) = |\lbrace (a_1,a_2) \in A^2 : a_1 + a_2 \in A \rbrace|$. It seems to me that $F(A)$ captures the notion of "closed under sumset" more directly. How come $F(A)$ isn't studied more in additive combinatorics? What kinds of statements can one make about the relationship between $F(A)$ and $E(A)$? In particular, I'm mostly concerned with situations when $G$ is a vector space like $\mathbb{F}^n$ for some finite field $\mathbb{F}$. 

Here's my question: given two base points $b$ and $b'$ of $f$, we've performed the Hensel lifting procedure to obtain the Hensel factors $\{ g^{(b)}_i \}$ and $\{ g^{(b')}_i \}$ (lifted to the same level). Since $F$ is algebraically closed, there are the same numbers of Hensel factors over $b$ as there are over $b'$. Is there any relation between $g^{(b)}_i$ and $g^{(b')}_i$ that's meaningful? Can we say that $g^{(b)}_i(X - b) = g^{(b')}_i(X - b')$? That is, are Hensel roots preserved across change of base points? Thank you! 

It isn’t obvious to me why this should be true. I found the edit where this remark was added, and it doesn’t include any links or references. Can anyone give a proof – or supply a reference, if this is a known result? Added: As Anthony Quas points out in the comments, the example doesn’t match the description. Based on the example the claim should presumably be that $n \choose k$ is the number of paths of semilength $n+1$ that have $k+1$ u’s in odd positions and $k+1$ returns. But this error makes me wonder if the whole thing is nonsense. I’ll check some more examples. 

So in total there are $$\sum_{i=0}^a\sum_{j=0}^b{i+j\choose i}^2{a-i\ +\ b-j\choose a-i}^2$$ such pairs, as required. 

Added. Thanks to Richard Stanley’s helpful answer, I now know that the first of these identities is known in the literature as Shapiro’s Catalan convolution, and has a bijective proof due to Hajnal and Nagy (2014). Added further. I hadn’t realised quite how straightforwardly each of these identities implies the other. For example, if the first holds then: $$\begin{align} 2\sum_{a+b=n}C_{2a}{4b\choose 2b}&=2\sum_{a+b=n}(2b+1)C_{2a}C_{2b}\\ &=\Bigl(\sum_{a+b=n}(2a+1)C_{2a}C_{2b}\Bigr)+\Bigl(\sum_{a+b=n}(2b+1)C_{2a}C_{2b}\Bigr)\\ &=(2n+2)\sum_{a+b=n}C_{2a}C_{2b}\\ &=(2n+2)4^nC_n\\ &=2\cdot 4^n {2n\choose n} \end{align}$$ In light of that, a proof of one is essentially also a proof of the other. 

but the original photograph may still be recovered by running the algorithm twice – once for the rows, and once for the columns – though now the result might be flipped upside-down as well as left-to-right. 

The answer as written is next, followed by the note of doubt I added after trying to understand the proof. 

p. 324: This investigation on the real and ideal complex numbers is completly identical to the classification of certain related forms of degree $\lambda-1$ in $\lambda-1$ variables, of which Dirichlet has found but not yet published the main results. p. 325: I have so far not yet studied this area of the theory of complex numbers in depth; in particular I have not yet worked out the determination of the true number of classes since I have heard by word of mouth that Dirichlet, using principles similar to those in his famous memoirs on quadratic forms, has already found this number. 

Meyer (Über einen Satz von Dirichlet, Crelle 103 (1888)) proved that a primitive binary quadratic form with nonsquare discriminant represents infinitely many primes that lie in any given compatible residue class modulo a given integer N. He did so only for forms with even middle coefficient, and did not address the signs of primes, but both of these require only minor modifications. This answer makes me wonder whether someone actually proved, with Dirichlet's methods, that a finite number of forms with coprime discriminants simultaneously represent infinitely many primes - by Chebotarev, this has to be true. 

Here $(q/2)_4$ is $+1$ or $-1$ according as $p$ is congruent to $1$ or $9$ modulo $16$. In the case $(p/q) = -1$, the Hilbert $2$-class field coincides with the genus field $K^* = Q(\sqrt{p},\sqrt{q}\,)$. This is also the Hilbert $2$-class field in the usual sense if $(p/q) = +1$ and $(p/q)_4 (q/p)_4 = -1$; in this case, however, there is a quadratic extension of the genus field unramified at finite primes, which can be constructed explicitly by solving the diophantine equation $x^2 - 4py^2 = q$ and setting $K = K^*(\sqrt{\mu})$ for $\mu = x + 2y\sqrt{p}$, where the sign of $x$ is chosen in such a way that $\mu$ is congruent to a square mod $4$, i.e., such that $x + 2y \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. In this case this means that $x$ is negative. For the smallest discriminants, the corresponding elements are
