There are essentially no rides that are 'unimpeded by pedestrian or car traffic' around Brooklyn, because Brooklyn is on a densely-populated island adjacent to another even more densely populated island so there's no nearby countryside, and we still use our rail lines very heavily so there are no rail trails. The 30-miler I've found with the most 'open road' feeling is heading to Breezy Point on side streets through Flatbush— take something like E. 35th Street down to Marine Park, then take the bike trail along Flatbush Ave. to the Marine Parkway bridge and Rockaway Point Boulevard. There are very few lights between the Flatbush Ave. bike trail and the tip of Breezy Point, so about half of the ride is unimpeded. I usually loop back via the Belt Parkway bike trail and take Bedford Avenue back north. Basically, something like this: $URL$ But if you want easy access to 'real' road riding from the city, you'll probably want to live in Northern Manhattan or the Bronx. 

A commodity security seatclamp, like Fortified, just uses a security bolt, which is still good enough to have kept my seatpost in place permanently on a bike that's regularly parked on the streets of New York: 

I'm encountering some confusion on frame size and any clarification would be greatly appreciated. I've always been under the impression that a stated frame size was the distance, usually in cm, from the top of the seat tube to the center of the BB opening. For example looking at any of the road bikes on the Trek site: $URL$ For all the bikes the "Frame Size Number" and the "Actual Frame Size" (see the chart at the bottom of the page for any of the bikes) are the same, even for the aero Madone. I'd like to purchase a Dengfu FM098 frame for a bike I'm planning on building: $URL$ The available sizes are listed as "49/52/54/56/58/61cm", but upon going to the Geometry tab this chart is shown: 

I'm under the impression that "O.L.D." = Over-Lock-nut Distance, i.e. the width of the axle between the threads, which should correspond to the distance between the inside of the drop-outs on the frame. I'm trying to figure out what the drop-down options mean and which is the correct choice in my case. Here's my best guess as to an expanded explanation of the options in the drop-down (also using the information from the description section): "QR / QR for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a traditional quick release (100 mm wide), rear axle is a traditional quick release (135 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "15mm / 135mm QR for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a thru-axle (15 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a traditional quick release (135 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "15mm / 142x12mm for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a thru-axle (15 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 142 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "12mm / 142x12mm for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 142 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "12mm / 135x12mm for Shimano/Sram 10,11s +$10" means: front axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 135 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes, at $10 additional cost Is my understanding correct? Returning to my specific situation, I'd like to stick with traditional quick-release skewers at both the front and rear, and I used an 11 speed Shimano Ultegra rear derailleur with the FM286 build. So, considering all of the above, I'm under the impression that the correct choice in my case would be the first axle option in the drop-down, "QR / QR for Shimano/Sram 10,11s", correct? Can anybody confirm my understanding of the above? If I'm incorrect in my interpretation anywhere, please clarify, thanks! 

If you have a local bike coop, they're likely to have pretty much all of what you need very cheaply: 

Rideye is coming out with a camera specifically designed as a bicycle black box: $URL$ In your format: 1: 15hr - 3. No weight listed - 4. $149US - 6. 1080p/170° - 7: :) It's not out yet, but at least spec-wise it seems like a winner. It's Kickstarted and a bit delayed, but I'm considering getting one when it's actually for sale. 

Your seattube is an enclosed metal tube that requires specific tools to access its apertures— pretty similar conceptually to a safe or car trunk, except in wall thickness. Depending on the diameter of your seatpost and width of your keys (which could conceivably be filed down) you could store the keys inside your seatpost/seattube and install a locking seatclamp of the many varieties available, offering various degrees of security. Atomic22's requires an actual key: 

So far, I've come across one bike with a broken pedal, and one with a seatpost stuck at minimum height. So eyeball the pedals. In other cities, it's apparently become conventional to put the seat backwards on broken bikes. I've seen it occasionally here, as well. 

I'm interested in using BSA crank parts with a certain BB30 frame and I'm a little unclear about cable routing, I'm hoping somebody here can help clarify the confusion. I'm considering purchasing a Dengfu FM286: $URL$ The concern is that I'm going to use a BSA crank parts and they only have a BB30 frame available in my size (3 month wait for BSA version in the proper size). I'm under the impression that frames with internal cable routing can allow the cables to pass the BB area in one of two ways, either through the BB opening, or underneath on the bottom of the frame in tubes, is this correct? For the typical BB30 to BSA adapters, for example: $URL$ $URL$ I'm under the impression that these could be used on a frame where the cables route in tubes underneath the frame, but could not be used in a frame where cables route through the BB opening, correct? If so, here is the further confusion on my part. I emailed Dengfu pertaining to the frame linked above, and received this response: "I show you pictures of BSA adapter and BB30 frame bottom. You can install cables internally." Here are the pics they sent: 

There have been quite a few 'alternative road' bikes with wider tires being made in recent years: $URL$ While rarely used for racing, they're very competent for general road riding when fitted with wide, supple, smooth tires. Even race bikes have been moving towards wider tires and rims in recent years. 

Tires can crack or dry rot and fail when pumped back to pressure, especially gumwalls exposed to UV-heavy sunlight. This is more likely in the 2-year timeframe than 3 months, but a common issue on old bikes donated to bike coops. 

Since your bike would just look like a bike, as opposed to a bike with a safe on it, it would be less of an unusual target to thieves. 

Are you prioritizing longevity above all else? Because nothing's likely to beat a cheap bike of thickwalled straight-gauge chro-moly steel (which isn't particularly vulnerable to corrosion, especially if you sand and repaint, or apply rust converter to, any nicks in the paint). Lightweight, high-end tubing is more vulnerable to picking up dings, buckling in a bike accident, or, in the case of Ti, just being rubbed right through by a tire. I have a stainless steel fork that I broke an eyelet off of previously, and just irreparably bent in a minor accident. On the other hand, Sheldon Brown rode an 80-plus year old steel bike that by all appearances was pretty neglected before his purchase. 1970s Schwinn road bikes were built so that their lifetime warranty would never need to be used, and you see a ton of them soldiering on through neglected maintenance and harsh urban riding. I'd bet a simply-designed straight-gauge chromoly bike would be your best bet for something similar new. Or you can look for a vintage frame of Columbus Aelle or equivalent, or perhaps a late-80s Miyata, which were also ED-coated, and have shown their mettle by lasting 25 years already. Today's cheap aluminum bikes also likely have thickwalled tubing, and are thus probably less vulnerable to dings, and are even less vulnerable to corrosion than steel. High-end money in the bike market generally buys lighter weight or more refined aesthetics, as opposed to ultimate durability. 

Scrolling down further under the "Description" section the following additional information is found: 

So I'm left with some questions: -For the adapter (1st pic), is this a BB30 to BSA adapter with pre-machined holes? It appears to be but I'm not sure -For the frame (2nd pic), does that appear to be a BB30 frame? I would suspect so since there don't appear to be BB threads but I'm not sure. -Also for the frame, are those two tubes on the bottom of the frame (they appear to be gold colored in the pic, but that's probably just the lighting, I would suspect they are actually white) where the cables route through? If so, does that mean any BB30 to BSA adapter could be pressed in and still allow the cable routing, or is it still necessary to utilize the BB hole in some way? I will contact the company further about this, but I'm also interested in the expertise of anybody in this forum that can offer information about BB30 to BSA conversion for an internally routed cable frame, and also your impressions of the images above. Please advise, thanks! 

My head is spinning with confusion on BB terminology, I'm hoping somebody can clarify things. I'm interested in building a road bike with the Dengfu FM098 frame and an Ultegra groupset that I would like to purchase from Chain Reaction Cycles. The frame is here: $URL$ And from Chain Reaction the Ultegra groupset can be purchased here with some options: $URL$ or here with pretty much every conceivable option: $URL$ So here is where the confusion begins. The Dengfu link above lists the FM098 Bottom Bracket as "BB: English BB/BB30", I'm under the impression that this means a choice of an "English BB" or a "BB30" bottom bracket, is this correct? Now considering the Chain Reaction Ultegra Groupset links, the one with fewer options does not list an option for BB, rather it states "Incl. Hollowtech II Bottom Bracket SM-BBR60 BSA". The Ultegra Groupset builder with the many options has 2 choices for BB after choosing the Shimano Ultegra 6800 Bottom Bracket option, "English 68mm" or "Italian 70mm" So I checked the Wikipedia page for BBs: $URL$ The table towards the bottom (see the column heading "Bottom Bracket Thread Name") seems to imply that ISO/English & BSC (British Standard Cycle) and BSA all effectively mean the same thing, and that the shell with for these is 68mm. At this point I'm under the impression that the Denfgu "BB: English BB/BB30" means a choice of an English Bottom Bracket or a BB30 Bottom Bracket. I'm also under the impression that the Chain Reaction Cycles Ultegra Groupset with "Incl. Hollowtech II Bottom Bracket SM-BBR60 BSA" would match the Dengfu frame with the English BB option, since BSA seems to mean the same thing as English, and English seems to be 68mm, is this correct? If not, would the Chain Reaction Ultegra Groupset Builder with the "English 68mm" option fit the Dengfu FM098 frame with the "English BB" option (supposing this is actually a separate option from the "BB30" on the Dengfu FM098)? Sorry if this is a beginner question but BB terminology can be quite confusing! 

As long as the bike paths and roads you'll be traveling along are reasonably well cleared of deep snow, this would be no big issue. You can order basic Schwalbe Winter studded tires cheaply (around 40euro a pair) from Bike24. You should probably be able to find a basic used bike for 110 euro. Studded tires aren't strictly necessary for winter riding, but they do provide peace of mind on days with a freeze-thaw cycle. 

A lot depends on the design goals for the bike. High-end road bike gear often isn't terribly durable because it's designed to minimize weight at the expense of all else. Carbon is likely to be less durable in the long run than metal, especially if the bike's used for utility purposes and regularly locked up and knocked around. A cheap fixed gear is pretty low-maintenance: in order of frequency, all you have to do is oil the chain, change the brake pads, change the tires and chain, and replace the bottom bracket and wheel bearings. After a few years, the brakes might wear through the rims. But you're giving up functionality (that you may or may not want) in exchange for less maintenance. More expensive hand-built wheels generally are stronger than cheaper machine-built wheels.
