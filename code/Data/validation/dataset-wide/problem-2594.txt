Form (physical). Ex: one's body, smell, etc. Consciousness (clear and knowing and not physical). Ex: an eye consciousness apprehending shape and colour. Non-associated compositional factors. Ex: time, emptiness, etc. 

This is a very partial answer because I can provide no textual reference. Differences between mantras of the same deity are of two types: 

There are conventionally existent objects. Whether you call them wholes or parts does not make a difference, since a part is also a whole and a whole a part. For instance, the petals of a flower are a part of the flower, but a petal is a whole [as a petal]. Whatever is an object found by a conventional valid cognizer (such as the eye-consciousness, the ear-consciousness, and so forth) exists conventionally. Since I can see you, you are conventionally existent. However, no object can withstands ultimate analysis. Another way of saying is that a cognizer analyzing the ultimate will find only emptiness of true existence. For instance, you will not be found by a cognizer validly analyzing "are you your body? are you your anger? are you your feelings? etc." but you are found by an eye-consciousness (since I see you). In the same way that sound is not apprehended by an eye-consciousness, no conventional truth is found by a mind of ultimate analysis. That is the Madhyamika-Prasangika view. This being said, there is no Buddhist school that posits there is no conventionally existent objects. 

While Khedrup Je was the 1st Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was recognized, by H.H. the Dalaï-Lama, as the 11th Panchen Lama. He was also recognized as such by the Chinese government that decided to have a say in the so-called “Tulku system [of recognition]”. Although Gyaltsab Je was the Spiritual Leader of the Gelug tradition (Ganden Tripa) after Tsongkhapa, Khedup Je also became the Ganden Tripa in time, after Gyaltsab Je's passing. As a result, their philosophical work is highly regarded by Gelug teachers and students. Gelug students still study the 1st Panchen Lama's commenteries, along with Gyaltsab Je's. Khedrup Je was also a teacher of Gendün Druppa, the 1st Dalaï-Lama. From the time of the 5th Dalaï-Lama, the Dalaï-Lama & the Panchen Lama held the responsibility of recognizing one another['s reincarnation]. It is believed that Khedrup Je was a reincarnation of Subhuti (the one depicted in the Vajra Cutter Sutra, a disciple of Shakyamuni Buddha). Whether his imprisonment affected the Buddhist community, and if so, in what way, is difficult to tell. His imprisonment means: … a teacher of H.H. the Dalaï-Lama being imprisoned … a candidate to the regency of H.H. the Dalaï-Lama being imprisoned … one of the main disciples of the founder of the Geluk tradition being imprisoned … a candidate to the position of Ganden Tripa being imprisoned … a potentially influential of textual commentaries being imprisoned 

This does not prevent us from aspiring to take upon ourselves the suffering of others, and to give away our happiness and its causes (merits). And this is the whole point: we cultivate an intention, because this intention will be a cause of achieving enlightenment. It is just like the perfection of generosity: the virtuous intention to give. One (arya bodhisattva) can cultivate the perfection of generosity, that is the intention, even when there are still needy people in the world. Cultivating generosity does not mean eradicating poverty. Similarly, taking it upon oneself to establish sentient beings in enlightenment does not mean establishing them in enlightenment. The best a buddha can do is turning the wheel of Dharma, out of his omniscient mind, and that turning will be but a condition (not the substantial cause) of others' enlightenment. 

No, in Mahayana, we want to achieve enlightenment in order to be able to benefit all sentient beings uninterruptedly, without limitations of ours (death being one of them). Instead of focusing on equanimity, rather train in being patient, content, and have few desires. First, there is less risks of being confused about what patience, contentment and few desires are. Second, it is more at reach for a beginner. Third, aversion to pain causes much unhappiness while patience opposes this. We suffer a great deal just because we have the notion that we would be better off without this or that, or having this or that. Discontent and desires also create much unhappiness. Tibetan do not usually emphasize Anapana. The concentration factor is in general just a means for the mind to become stable and flexible, and then abide in virtue. Right now, it's difficult to study for a long period of time, or to meditate for a long period of time. Body and mind get sore and exhausted, there is pain and boredom. We cultivate the three factors of concentration, mindfulness and introspection by doing Anapana (or usually focusing on the mental image of the body of the buddha) simply to become able to abide in virtue for as long as we want. It is like opening your eyes to then get to see this and that. Unfortunately, there are people who engage in Anapana meditation and the like just to feel better, temporarily sheltered from their issues, away from their usual obsessive and discursive thoughts, etc. These are not wholesome motivations. Great teachers usually say: if you want to relax, take a nap. It's way easier than meditating. Meditation should not replace the bottle. It should not be a means to bury your head in the sand or an anesthetic that makes your life more bearable. There is no better way to damage the karma you have accumulated than: 

Now, to answer your questions more directly: 1) Sentient beings do not exist They do not exist inherently (or truly), they do exist conventionally. A valid eye consciousness apprehending a person is valid with regard to the entity of the thing. Compassion towards a person is valid with regard to the entity of the thing as well. Compassion towards a unicorn, however, is not. 2)For one to be compassionate he has to be deluded to believe that sentient beings exist. No. For one to be compassionate, he has to have some sort of insight into the four noble truths. Also, he who believes that sentient beings are utterly non-existent is deluded. So is he who believes they exist inherently (which is the whole topic here). 3)Compassion itself is a delusion It is not, because a delusion is never valid with regard to the entity of the thing. For instance, anger does not engage its object correctly. The object [of engagement] of anger is as non-existent as a unicorn. In addition, delusions take away the peace of the mind (it's their definition) and superimpose. 4)One should remain deluded to alleviate the nonexisting suffering of nonexisting sentient beings. This is not the case, since the conventionally existent buddhas do alleviate the conventionally existing suffering of conventionally existent sentient beings. 

However, I do not know whether they posit them as being 'of definite meaning', and which turning of the wheel they claim these sutras belong to. My answer is all in all very incomplete. 

The wisdom arisen from analytical meditation on emptiness is yeshe. It is the one we refer to when we speak of the higher training in wisdom. Or when we speak of cultivating the perfection of wisdom. Intelligence refers to a mental factor that a student must have. It resembles shes rab. In the Middle Length Lam Rim, Tsongkhapa says: 

This is the general presentation. It is given in the context of practices common with beings of small capacities. In the context of bodhisattva practices, however, things are different. In the Book of Kadam, Atisha says: 

One harvest what one has sown / None can take someone else's karma upon him Buddha can not give enlightenment to others. Dharma is not heard in Avici. But there is a story of a hell being generating compassion for another hell being's suffering. According to that story, the other hell being was an emanation of a buddha, and he meant for the first to generate compassion so as to create a cause of happiness. 

Most Tibetans still mourn him. If you go to McLeod Ganj or Boudhanath, you will see plenty of posters with his pictures, and printed characters such as “Give back the Panchen Lama!” Kyabje Lama Zopa Rinpoche (that many think of as clairvoyant, or even enlightened and thus omniscient) said that Gedhun Choekyi Nyima (from whom we have never heard of again otherwise) is still alive, safe and sound. 

From a Tibetan viewpoint, Shakyamuni was an emanation body of the Buddha. He merely showed the aspect of being born, aging, achieving enlightenment, passing into parinirvana, and so forth [but was actually free from birth, aging, sickness and death and so forth]. While the enjoyment body is too subtle for ordinary beings to see, the emanation body is seen by ordinary beings. Wheel-turning buddhas are thus said to be emanation bodies. Vajrasattva, on the other hand, would be the enjoyment body in the aspect of a Bodhisattva. Such a body can be seen by arya beings. We claim that when an arya bodhisattva chooses to be reborn in a pure land in order to receive teachings there from other bodhisattvas, he receives teachings from actual bodhisattvas as well as from the enjoyement body in the aspect of bodhisattvas (such as Vajrasattva, Manjushri, and so forth). Vajrasattva is one of these aspects, manifestations. He is a subtle manifestation of the form body of buddha. Avalokiteshvara was one of 'the eight principal Mahayana disciples of Buddha Shakyamuni', that is the sambhogakaya in the aspect of a disciple. The same is true of Manjushri. The main difference between Manjushri and Vajrasattva, in relation to their entity, is that Manjushri is said to be a [manifestation of the] wisdom truth body (i.e. the omniscient mind) and not that of the enjoyment body. 

Mindfulness Concentration Introspection (or 'alertness' or 'vigilance' depending on the translation). 

As far as I know, the concept of the Universal Mind (一心, yixin) was first coined in the 'Awakening of Faith'. In studying Zongmi, Yanshou, Chinul and Wonhyo, I found different translations such as: Universal Mind, All-encompassing mind, One Mind, One Nature, Pure Nature. Some say it is synonymous with mind-nature (xinxing). But neither alternative translations nor synonymous tell me what it is. In studying Yongming Yanshou systematically, I have come to identify what he says it is, its characteristics, and its functions. The issue is that it ends up being identified with so many phenomena that it becomes confusing. Its entity: 

It is not so much that phenomena lack intrinsic value or meaning, it is that they lack intrinsic existence. The object of negation is a mode of existence, it is not just value or meaning. As to your question, consciousness is that which is clear and knowing. It is in the nature of clarity and has the function of knowing. Since a consciousness is always a consciousness of something, we usually speak in terms of instances. For instance, we speak of "an eye consciousness apprehending a cup", "an ear consciousness apprehending a birdsong", "a memory consciousness remembering a person" and so forth. There is no consciousness that does not depend on a basis that is its apprehended object. This is one of the various reasons we say there is no soul (if by soul we mean something immaterial that does not depend on an apprehended object). Furthermore, we would probably agree with the scientific claim that "Consciousness depends on the brain." The whole question is: In what way does consciousness depend on the brain? What is the nature of that dependence? A consciousness also depends on its apprehended object, since there is no independent consciousness. A consciousness also depends on its function, since there is no consciousness that does not accomplish a function. A consciousness also depends on the previous moment of consciousness, and so forth. Thus, a consciousness depends on various factors, but that does not mean that these factors are necessary conditions. I doubt His Holiness (whom you quote) would be convinced that the brain and consciousness (that is, the mind stream) are one entity. I doubt he would be convinced one is a necessary condition of the other. In fact, there is no proof that the brain is a necessary condition, merely that consciousness depends on it. In short, we do not know the nature of this dependence. All in all, His Holiness's school posits that the substantial cause of consciousness is a preceding moment of consciousness. It means that a consciousness is like a seed to a tree. A seed causes the tree, it becomes the tree, it no longer exists at the time of the tree (unlike your parents who caused your birth and still exist after that), and is a necessary condition. It is the main reason why we say that, since a consciousness can not turn into anything but a next moment of consciousness, the continuum does not end. So-called Hinayana tenets might hold a different view.
