If you have to ask, I'd say it's likely the answer is no. If you have lived in Canada all your life and own appropriate gear to those temperatures, you probably have a better chance. I have been commuting and riding/racing in temperatures similar to and lower than those for several years. Prepping a bike for such temperatures is fairly involved and likely as expensive as a BSO. Simple modifications (like decent studded tires) can end up that expensive (or more) again. Even with proper preparations, A 15 minute summer commute can turn into a 45 minute (or longer) commute in winter as frozen grease and stiff sidewalls absorb all the power you are putting out. Without proper prep, it's likely you'll just be pushing (or carrying) the bike. Riding in a serious (well below zero) winter ends up being a fairly expensive and intensive proposition to do safely. Moisture management is (among other things) a key skill you will need. It can most certainly be done, but it really isn't a thing I'd recommend for a casual rider. 

Individual "ideal cadence" is probably more closely related to muscle composition and comfort than it is to size. While someone could probably "maths out" an ideal cadence for a rider based on all the variables necessary (height, weight, power, muscle composition, etc), that won't matter one whit if the rider has spent the 2500 hours over the last 3 months practicing at a different cadence that they are now comfortable at. Riding is largely a practiced unconscious act (spinning) that is developed over time. Making major (or even minor) changes has the potential to ruin the whole unconscious part, making the act tedious and draining and overall less efficient for an individual. Developing the unconscious act of riding with pedal drills or cadence drills is a difficult task that most recreational riders don't have the time or patience for. 

Get your sit bones measured. Bikes are made in different sizes, handlebars in different widths, cranks and stems in different lengths, seat tubes are adjustable. Why all this variation? Because people are built differently. So why just choose a saddle that "should be good" and go? Get your sit bones measured, then buy a saddle from a company that makes different width saddles to accommodate different riders anatomy accordingly. 

The only numbness I have ever experienced on long rides (6+ hours) was due to poor fit or equipment failure. The endurance cyclists I known have never described anything "going numb" as a regular occurrence with distance riding. I can tell you that at the end of a very long ride (12+ hours) I am generally starting to get sore. I have not great knees, and the tendons and ligaments in them tend to become inflamed after more than 12 hours or so of riding. They hurt, I wish more than anything that they went numb. There tends to be an odd phenomenon where after many hours on a bike doing anything except sitting or laying down I find horrible. Walking and or moving is just uncomfortable, it's preferable to ride more, or not move at all. 

I'll venture a guess that currently there are two lines defining the "plus" range you are talking about. Anything under 2.75 to 3 inches will likely be defined as a regular MTB tire. These were often called "fat tires" until Surly popularized the Endomorph, which made the term "fat tire" fall out of favor for regular mountain bike tires. The original Endomorph was (I believe) a 3.7 inch tire which sort of starts the current range of "fat tires" and goes up. "Plus" tires are a relatively recent thing that Surly also had a big hand in (look up the Krampus or the Knard) that consists of tires to big to fit the frames of most regular mountain bikes, but still a bit smaller than the current "fat tire" market (3.7 inches and up). I'd say the current "Plus" range is maybe 2.7 inches to 3.7 inches. One of the current uses for the plus set that I have seen is running 29'r plus tires and wheels in a 26 inch "fat bike" frame for summer or hard trail conditions. Again all of these definitions may change as the market and common tire sizes change, but I believe that's about the current state of things. When looking at these setups perhaps the most important thing to consider is what size the frame will be required to fit the setup. 

One problem is that the design would not be appropriate for technical riding requiring speed. Getting behind the seat to push against the pedals would put you out over nothing, instead of out over the back wheel. The design would be less stable because of that and consequently unsuitable for technical riding. The puts it out for mountain styles of riding. On the road side, the UCI has been fairly quick to ban anything as non-traditional as this. While materials improvements and the like are generally the norm, major changes to the geometry of a bike is combed over closely and often thrown out. New designs take sometime to take hold (Fat bikes are a good example from recent years). The fat bike market lingered for years because very few companies were producing the tyres, bottom brackets, cranksets, hubs and rims it needed to grow. Although most of the other parts were standard road and mountain bike parts, key components can be a hold back. Once these bikes started getting raced regularly, the market and manufacture of the specialty parts took off. For the design you are talking about, I don't see enough appreciable advantages for the commuter market to champion it. Since it's not appropriate for the other markets, I can't see such a radially departing design gaining any traction. 

Keep in mind there are trade offs. Your current pedals may have no grip, but you can probably ride them barefoot, in flip flops, etc. More agressive pedals will most certainly keep your feet from sliding off, but are also famous for causing shin and leg injuries when they catch you unawares. You may also look at cages which will hold your feet in place as well, but are a bit harder to get out of (meaning you may get your foot stuck and fall). 

That depends on a number of factors specific to your bike (for which you have listed no specifics), but the likely answer is no. You need to check your frame/fork and brakes for available space. Many road frame/fork combos I have seen will accept much larger tires (32c or maybe 35c) however, the brake arches are very tight and will not allow a tire larger than say, 28c. If you carefully follow along the entire edge of your wheel (front and back) you can check for any tight spots. If you don't have at least a fingers worth of room every where the frame, fork, brake or anything else gets tight, it probably isn't going to work. If you have at least that much room, it may be worth having a shop ready to sell you those expensive tires trial fit one on your rim, and see if the studs will tear a whole somewhere or not. 

I think my rough estimate would be 10 to 15%, although an argument might be made for less taking into account markup. Cannondale was one of the last big manufacturers to produce all their frames in the US. We carried them in a shop I worked at during the time they transitioned over. Basically, one year all their bikes were ten to fifteen percent more expensive than their comparable counterparts (Trek, Specialized and Kona at the time in this particular shop) as it had been since I worked there. The next year the prices were more in line with the other manufacturers and the frames had "Made in China" stickers. I have checked in the last few years, but some manufacturers used to still build their highest end products in their home country. Beyond the big manufacturers there are still many smaller or custom builders active and alive in the US. If you look at the pricing differences between a litespeed, seven or lynskey and a major manufacturer, you may get an idea. But you may also choose simply pay that higher price and get a bicycle that was for sure designed and made here in the US. 

I highly recommend a set of poagies, which will likely be far warmer than your gloves to start with. You can throw chemical warmers in them to really make them like an oven. At that point a very thin set of gloves (like regular summer full fingers) that still offer some protection can be used quite effectively for short bursts outside your poagies. For one to have immediate problems when removing gloves in the cold, it suggests a circulatory issue, or that your hands were not reasonably warm to start will. Either way a good set of poagies will put you in a better starting place. 

Winter|Snow riding - Interior Alaska. Extended winter riding season (usually September/October through April). Low overall snowfall meaning rides are rarely "snowed out". Consistently low temperatures lead to trails that stay and don't melt. High "other" traffic (snow machines, dog sleds, skijorers, cross country skiers) and large volume of trails means there is always somewhere to ride. High population of winter bike riders for size (Alaska is arguably the birthplace of snow bike racing). 

I don't know anything specifically about this model saddle, but all leather saddles share the same group of strengths and weaknesses. Leather Saddles have a few drawbacks. They require a break in period. They require regular maintenance, more so when used in foul weather. They tend to be heavier than most current saddle designs. There are mixed reviews on their durability in below freezing weather. They have advantages as well. Eventually, when cared for properly, they will essentially become a custom saddle fitted to you. They can be cooler than many modern designs when used in warm weather. The long and short is that they require MUCH more maintenance then other current saddle options which are essentially install and forget for potentially more comfort. My recommendation is that if you like the "look" of a leather saddle, they may not be for you. If you are aiming for the most comfortable saddle possible and willing to sacrifice some amount of time doing maintenance, they may be for you. 

The facts are that it is impossible to keep a bike from being stolen by a skilled and/or a determined thief. I was fairly excited when I saw a bicycle design that actually used the frame as the locking mechanism some time ago. If destroying the locking mechanism means destroying the frame, there is little reward for stealing the bike. However, a friend who is a hobbyist lock pick pointed out to me that few locks are immune to picking or some other method of unintended opening. Long story short, no method of securing a bike will work against a skilled and determined thief. Most people settle on a method that requires some inconvenience on their part that imparts some amount of security. The methods that are more secure are generally less convenient and vice versa. However, I have yet to see a method of complete security, although I could think of several which would completely eliminate convenience. The method you describe would still be vulnerable to having the chain cut. With the proliferation of cheap, mostly portable power tools, almost any chain can be cut anywhere in a very short amount of time. Buying a carrying a ridiculously heavy chain might possibly double the amount of time for it to be cut (30 seconds instead of 15!). The weight difference you would have to carry around for that extra 15 seconds should make it beneficial to very few people. The video you linked makes a big show of using huge bolt cutters. It doesn't bother (deliberately) to bring out a much smaller, more portable and more useful grinder. The below video should give you a better idea. 

No. The typical "pollution mask" I have seen are modified or styled after surgical masks. Surgical masks are NOT designed to filter intake air. They are designed to direct exhaust air away from a patient who is opened up and vulnerable to infection. The masks shown on your links appear to have possibly a sealing face mask, but the filters look clearly inadequate. To properly filter air, you will need a mask that seals around your mouth and nose and has a proper one way valve(es) and appropriate filters. Interior Alaska has some of the poorest air quality in the world during both the winter (inversion layer) and summer (forest fires) months. What I have taken to using are the rather inexpensive "paint style" masks that 3M and other companies make that are available from home improvement stores like Home Depot. The masks are rated for organic vapors and have replaceable filters, although I find it easier to simply replace the whole mask. As for the difficulty breathing in these masks, I find that I cannot get enough air through them to maintain a full sprint, however, I can get enough to maintain a "race pace". After a bit of use, I get even less air, or I can change the prefilters and filters and get back to where I started. 

If you want to make a very large flange hub (to produce shorter spoke lengths and produce a stiffer wheel), bonding a large metal flange to a carbon hub shell is not a bad idea. If you try doing it with a one piece design, the larger shell (coming from the larger flange) would likely make the hub heavy. Making the shell out of carbon instead has the the potential to preserve the advantages of a large flange without the drawbacks of having an overweight heavy metal shell. 

No. Older bicycles are no harder to work on than modern bicycles provided you have specialized knowledge regarding older standards, possibly specialized tools and the ability to obtain parts designed for older standards. Generally a bicycle built now will likely conform to a set of standards that are common and in place now. If you bought a bike today, and purchased all the tools necessary to work on it today, you'd likely find that new bikes five years from now would have a lot of overlap, but some standards would be new/different and a few new tools may be required. In addition, all the parts necessary to rebuilt said bike would be available. Five years from now you would have a lower percentage chance of finding all the parts, but it would still be very high. Additionally some of the newer mechanics may not be familiar with your "older" setup, but there would be many around that were very familiar with it. Drag this out for 30+ years and you see where it is headed. A "vintage" (a term badly stolen from the wine industry and used incorrectly) bike will have mostly standards that are no longer used, require some tools that may no longer be common, and may or may not commonly have parts available. Additionally, 30 year veteran bike mechanics are a rarity, so someone with all the knowledge of said bike is going to be hard to find as well. It simply isn't worth most mechanic's time to try and figure out a bike from sometime around when they were born or earlier (especially when they are paid by the job). People often buy inexpensive (or overpriced) "vintage" bicycles thinking that it should be cheap to fix up an old bike. The truth is that it requires specialized knowledge, parts and sometimes tools. It should be similar to what you would expect buying a 1978 Ford LTD that is rotting out and not currently running.
