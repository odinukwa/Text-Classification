I'd suggest thinking less about 'locking your legs', and instead think more about pressing down hard with your trailing leg. I find that if I put too much effort into pulling up my leading leg I end up pulling the muscles in my groin. You'll still need to pull up a little and lean over the front to initiate the skid, but focus on the push to make it easier on your legs. Also, practicing in the wet makes it much easier to get the rear wheel to slide. Anyway, install a front brake for when someone pulls out on you or jumps out from the pavement so you can stop it quickly, and practice skid stops in more controlled environments first :) 

TL;DR - Do intervals. Although I have a few different routes I regularly take to work, 75% of the time it's just one route. I find doing intervals very useful to keep the route interesting. If you know the route, including hills, flats and descents well, you can really aim to go full bore a particular section of it and then switch the bits you go hard on. Doing this also makes the slower rides on the same route more enjoyable and less painful! I like to do efforts on a few of the hills I have on my commute, and though I ride them on a fixed gear, you could add another element by limiting yourself to certain gears for certain bits of the commute as an extra challenge. Good luck! 

I think it depends on the type of bikes you'll be loading onto the rack. I have a 4-bike hitch-mounted rack (similar to this rack). My wife's cruiser is just large enough that it takes some attention to position when I load the next bike to get them all to fit. What I've run into is that the handlebars of smaller bikes tend to get in the way of the seatpost of the next bike (I load each bike facing the opposite way). In my case, her brake lever likes to get caught on my rack, so it takes some practice to get around these problems. If you can, I would try purchasing a 2-bike mount from a place that will let you return it, take it home and try it out. If it can hold both bikes, you're good to go, and if not, you can take it back and purchase a larger rack. 

The Planet X EC-130 'Rivet Rider' was extremely well reviewed by Cycling Weekly last year and you can get them new from Planet X at around that kind of money. Other than that, direct to consumer brands such as Canyon, Ribble and Rose may offer a few different options for around the 1k mark. If you're happy to look used you can get a lot of bike for 1k, up to Dura-Ace/Super Record/Red groupsets on high end frames, just make sure you do your research and you should be fine. 

You can ride any bike in a race, provided it's in good enough working order to get you over the line. Regarding gears, it looks like the cost to add derailleur style gears may be prohibitive, as I assume this bike's rear wheel is single-speed specific and the dropouts aren't vertical (which isn't the end of the world but not ideal). I'd probably either look at a geared road bike, or rebuild your rear wheel around an Alfine/Nexus internally geared hub. If this is your first race I'd probably just ride what you have to see if you like riding competitively before spending money on upgrades or on a new bike. edit: This 'race' appears to be a 200km audax - I'd be incredibly reluctant to do that kind of distance as your first race. Have you ridden over 150km in one hit? If you're super fit, or not bothered about your time you could do it on your existing bike, but a specific road/audax bike would do it quicker and more comfortably. Maybe build up slowly to that kind of distance - that's a very long day in the saddle. 

Summers in my area get up to 90-100 during the day, and I would not ride around in a long sleeve shirt. My personal favorite shirt to wear is something like the Pearl Izumi Attack Short Sleeve Jersey from Performance Bike: 

I noticed my crank making a noise when I would crank hard, and it ended up being the pedal. It was the cheap plastic pedals that came with the bike (before I switched to clipless), and the pedal itself was starting to break. It would bend when I was cranking hard, and it finally broke on me (thankfully, just down the street from my house). So, I would check the pedal, and check the bolts for the whole area to make sure everything's tightened down properly. 

It's my favorite because of the color - "high visibility yellow". Most of my riding is on local streets, and it makes me feel better knowing I'm nice and bright-colored. I prefer this over a regular t-shirt because it lets more air through, doesn't get heavy as it absorbs my sweat, and it has handy-dandy pockets in the back (great for my work ID, so I don't have to dig through my bag to find it to swipe in the building). You can check with your local bike shop and see what you like - I'm not a very skinny guy, so the tight-fitting bike jerseys don't look good on me. There are a lot of biking shirts that are looser fitting, some being designed as "mountain biking" clothes. 

I'd get a brake on it and make sure it's serviceable then ride it for a while and see how you like it. Riding fixed takes some getting used to, so get some miles in before making your mind up! 

I'm sure greater knowledge will make itself known here, but for me it's more about the quality of the hub rather than the noise which draws many bikers (roadies included) and 'quality' hubs tend to be louder when freewheeling. I'm thinking specifically of Hope and Chris King hubs here, I think the noise is a side effect of the components, but I have no idea why they are louder! 

I own a Surly Steamroller, and although I haven't done it myself, many other Steamroller riders put a Surly Disk Trucker fork into the Steamroller frame. With the exception of the fork altering the geometry ever so slightly, it's a pretty like-for-like switch. It's also a fairly inexpensive option. You can pick the frames up for sub £200 and the forks for a good way under £100 in the UK. Then build up with whatever parts you fancy. 

I went on my first long bike ride yesterday - approximately 30 miles. (I know, it's cake to you grizzled road veterans out there, but I'm proud!) I had a great time and we took a fairly leisurely pace - approximately 10 mph or so. Lots of cycling and a lot of conversation. I didn't have any problems with energy or anything, but during the ride I was a bit sore in the saddle. Due to our pace, I was able to ease this a few times by standing in the pedals and pedaling infrequently. By the time we were getting back (the last mile or so) I was really feeling it, but today it seems to be okay. Overall, it worked well. I'm thinking that the soreness is probably just the symptoms of a longer ride (and me not being used to that). However, I figured I'd ask. How would I, as a relatively new rider, know when saddle soreness is caused by a bad (for me) saddle or bad saddle adjustment versus extended time in the saddle? Are there specific symptoms that I should be looking for? Edit: I'm looking for generalizations, as I know that specifics change with each rider and bike. An example would be something like, "if you have excessive soreness in your inner hamstring area, your seat may be too far forward", stuff like that. As it stands right now, I'm chalking this all up to the first ride, but I'd like to be knowledgable for future rides (and not ignore any potential warning signs I might miss). Thanks! (As a note, for anyone who might ask - I'm riding a Fuji Traverse 1.7. Everything's stock. I'm about 5'10", 5'11" with long limbs.) 

Yes, add the brake - as others have said, it might not be 'cool' but you'll end up being much more confident on it knowing you can stop it quickly. I also can't work out if you have foot retention or not from the picture, but even with a brake I'd highly recommend some kind of foot retention, and if you ride brakeless you are pretty much unable to stop at all without it. If you like it and it fits, keep it. If you don't really like it, or it doesn't fit then it doesn't sound like you'll lose too much by selling it. 

Although I'm unfamiliar with Tektro Lyra's, I have been bedding in a new Shimano SLX disc brake on my commuter so have a little recent experience on this. Given you are only 20 miles in I'd give it a little more time as this 'grinding' noise may just be the very top layer of the new pad wearing in. If it's still 'grinding' after 100 or so miles I'd take it back to the bike shop and ask them to check it over. Brake shudder may indicate the pads or calipers are every so slightly mis-aligned. There are loads of tutorials online about how to align them: $URL$ My SLX has taken about 120-130 miles (or 2-3 weeks' daily use) to bed in properly. Hope that helps! 

I got the blue pinstripe set and I love it - a bright source of light, like a car headlight, hits your bike, and you light up like a christmas tree. It's especially pronounced at night, and as cool as this picture is, it doesn't do it justice. Check out the video on their website for a nighttime demonstration. Edit: I thought I would share my picture of my bike with the blue BrightBike pinstripes on it. This is taken in my dark garage with my flash covered (just enough light to make it glow without the picture being blurry). In daylight, the color is almost the same as my paint color, so they're hard to see. 

These two books came highly recommended to me, and together they cover about every bike part your bike may have. (The road bike book doesn't cover "V" style brakes, since they're considered mountain bike parts). 

I've gotten back into riding fairly recently. I used to ride a bicycle a lot when I was younger - the single-speed, steel-frame deal with coaster brakes. I'm now riding a Fuji hybrid. When I was younger, standing to pedal was the thing to do. However, now when I do it, I can't really sustain it for more than four seconds, literally; my quads ache and I feel as though I have absolutely no endurance for this. This happens not only on hills, but on flat as well. Sitting to pedal has been alright for the most part. I'm able to climb hills in low gear (even though I'm really not good at it yet) and I can pedal well on flat ground. Standing is just a different story, as it takes it out of me so incredibly quickly that it's an almost useless technique. Am I doing something wrong? Might I need to adjust my handlebars to be higher or something? (My saddle is at a correct height, but perhaps when I stand, I'm having to lean too far forward to keep my hands on the bars?) Or is this common and it's something I'll just need to get over with practice? Don't get me wrong - I know that these things do come with time - but it doesn't seem to make sense that I get tired standing to pedal even on flat ground... Thank you. 

My inlaws ride recumbent bikes and had a hitch installed on their Toyota Camry and purchased a double-trike rack. 

MapMyRide.com uses Google Maps in their web application, but I'm not sure if you can import an already-planned route from Google Maps: 

If your car doesn't have a trailer hitch on it, you can have one installed and purchase a "trike and bike" rack that mounts in the trailer hitch receiver: 

Glueless patches are to get you home, and glued patches are for the permanent repair once you make it home. Personally, I carry a spare tube and glueless patches, and at home I have a nice glue kit. The glue kits actually bind the patch to the intertube, where the glueless stick on top over the puncture. That being said, I've had glueless patches stay on until I tossed the tube.
