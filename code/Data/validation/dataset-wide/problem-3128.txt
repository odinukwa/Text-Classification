Think about the global power balance at the time. Imperial Japan was a rising power that wants to expand against older, more entrenched alliances. Towards the south, it faced the maritime power of the United States which has a strong interest in keeping the Pacific and SE-Asia under her control. Towards the north, it faced the USSR. The Japanese leadership at the time had the confidence to either defeat USSR on land or the USA at sea - but not both. Hence the birth of the "Northern" and "Southern" doctrines. For most of the time until 1936, the "Northern" doctrine was the leading doctrine in the military. This was primarily because of two reasons. First, Japan had just recently conquered Northeastern China (Manchuria), which it sought to build as a new homeland for the Japanese people. In fact, immigrants had already began arriving, and the risk of losing Manchuria was becoming unacceptable. Second, the Army believed itself to be the creator of Japanese destiny and thus supported the Northern doctrine fervently - just as the Navy supported the Southern doctrine. At the time, the Army had more influence at the top echelons of Japanese decision-makers (in particular the Imperial General Headquarters). Finally, Japan was forming rather close ties with Germany which was (nominally at least) very hostile to the USSR; and at the same time Japan benefited from its trade relationship with the USA. This made USSR the natural enemy. A few things changed during 1936-1939. First, the London Naval Treaty of 1930 ended, and the Imperial Navy began a period of drastic expansion. And - as anyone familiar with history surely knows - the more military capacity you have, the more you begin to look for enemies. In addition, as Germany began to take over Europe, there was a power vacuum in Southeast Asia - particularly Indonesia, with its rich natural resources. To make a compromise between the Army and the Navy, the Japanese leadership ultimately decided to appease both sides - by pursuing a strategy of expanding in both directions. By the time 1939 arrived, however, the Northern doctrine had already lost most of its appeal. The army lost a lot of credibility with its drastic over-expectations of "conquering China in three months". With much of the Army trapped in China, creating a second front against USSR become infeasible. The Imperial Army apparently did not see this, however, and decided to launch a major offensive (without the Emperor's permission) against the USSR after some casual harassment from Mongolian troops. This resulted in the disaster in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, and the Army lost its credibility completely. And while Japanese troops were being slaughtered, Hitler signed a non-Aggression Pact with Stalin - and thus the Northern Doctrine fell apart. Main source: $URL$ (in Chinese) 

One should take with a grain of salt any "predictions" by "experts" about the stock market. An inherent characteristic of the stock market is that it is highly unpredictable in the short run. This follows by common sense: If one could predict the fluctuations in the stock market consistently, one could become the richest person in the world simply by shorting stocks at opportune moments, rather than spending all his time warning the public. For a more detailed argument, see A Random Walk Down Wall Street, which reflects current academic consensus. So, retrospective analyses about how "warnings were not heeded" are usually moral tales designed to lay blame on greedy investors, foolhardy families, or even human nature itself. In reality, well-documented histories about stock market crashes generally show that there are always as many "believers" in the stock market as skeptics before the crash. In particular, both John Maynard Keynes and Irving Fisher - leading economists of their generation - believed wrongly that the prices before the crashes of 1929 were reasonably priced.

These things come and go, as convenience and fear vie for attention in the public consciousness. I will extend to question to include passports, as there is an essential link between passports and visas, though they have somewhat different functions. Passports are essentially identity documents and general requests for safe travel from the government of the holder's country to the government of the place of travel. Visas are specific permissions to stay in a particular country and are used to more finely control what a person can do when travelling, exclude particular groups (e.g. criminals, certain nationalities) and to raise revenue. Visa requirements and costs are determined by security concerns, political expediency, trade agreements, and sometimes in a tit-for-tat manner. Passports In The Economic Consequences of the Peace, Keynes claims that is was the onset of World War I that borders began to be rigorously controlled, and documents began to be required for transit in modern Europe. Chapter II, Europe before the War: 

Chickering suggests that bonds were seen as a patriotic sacrifice and they were nominally honoured but their value reduced by inflation: 

The Incident at Pristina Airport, 12 June 1999, following the war in Kosovo, was a direct stand-off between NATO and the Russian Federation. Despite a desire (and order) for engaging in combat by SACEUR Wesley Clark,the incident passed without bloodshed allegedly after some strategic insubordination by now-crooner James Blunt. 

It also states that visa and passport free travel was possible between Canada and the US until the American Civil War. 

These two examples show that after engaging populations in total war, border controls become strengthened. After World War II, in 1947, the regulation of passports was given to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), an agency of the United Nations. Visas Visas are more complicated and may be required for entry and/or exit to a particular country or for particular purposes (e.g. work or leisure travel). The rules governing them are essentially a bell-weather of the relations between states. Indeed, friendly nations often participate in visa-free arrangements, particularly for tourist travel. Such arrangements have been developed at different points in time. Many nations also operate a visa-on-arrival policy (essentially just a requirement for payment), though it may depend on citizenship. As with the aftermath of WWI, the aftermath of WWII and up until the 1960's, was a time of great upheaval as empires crumbled and nations found their independence, particularly in Africa. Malcolm X It is not clear that Malcolm X was free to enter Saudi Arabia without a visa in normal circumstances. Indeed, his wikipedia article states that he had significant trouble entering and after some time entered as a state guest rather than a regular traveller. 

On 9 Nov 1989, GÃ¼nter Schabowski intended to announce an easing of restrictions on travel between East and West Germany. These were intended to ease growing tensions and demands for greater freedoms in East Germany. However, due to confusion and inept handling, he mistakenly told people that all restrictions would end immediately. Unprepared and uninformed border guards were overwhelmed by the numbers of people who wanted to cross over. This led the end of restrictions, the fall of the Berlin Wall and ultimately the end of his own government and the East German regime. 

They could do this because they issued bonds in their own currency to a largely domestic audience and transitioned off the gold standard to a fiat currency during the war, as explained in this article. 

Passport standards were defined in two conferences organised by the League of Nations, one in Paris in 1920 and another in Geneva in 1926. It is important to note that nations and the boundaries were significantly reconfigured in the aftermath of WWI and that enforcement of new boundaries would have helped define and legitimise these new entities to some extent. The Government of Canada affirms this point, but also states that passports and visa were common for travel in Europe, but the advent of rail travel made checking such documents infeasible and they were phased out in the mid to late 19th Century, before being reinstated for security reasons from WWI in what was seen as a temporary measure.
