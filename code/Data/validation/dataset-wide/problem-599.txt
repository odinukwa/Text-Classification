In the UK, Cyclestreet does this. I just tried a route over the Forth Road Bridge, starting and ending on the shore. On the elevation profile you can clearly see that it goes up to 40m (the height of the bridge) and is not projected onto the surface, which would be sea level: Cyclestreet is based in map data from OpenStreetMap, but it is not clear if they use also data from other sources. Presumably OSM has elevation data, but I could not find a way to see this in OSM directly. 

The introduction and abolition of bicycle licensing laws should also be seen in the context of wider attitudes towards the role of authorities, how much the state should regulate peoples' lifes. This has changed over the years. There is a general trend for deregulation, for removing regulations where there is no clear benefit for society, making the state leaner. A similar example is licensing and taxes for dogs, which also have been abolished in many countries, probably for similar reasons - a lot of expensive bureaucracy, very little benefit, bad compliance and very difficult to enforce. Collisions with the cyclist at fault kill about the same number of people as dogs (one or two people per year in UK), so irresponsible dog owners, like irresponsible cyclists, are generally more a nuisance than a real danger to society, and the authorities nowadays don't see a need for strict regulation. I'd think you also find a lot of regulations in completely other fields (how to keep your front garden, for example) were once strict but have been relaxed. It seems to me that in earlier decades people generally thought that the state should regulate individual behaviour much more, and attitudes have become more relaxed since the 1970s and 1980s. 

Install the cassette and derailleur. Measure your chain to the correct length (using Park Tool's 3rd method), but do not cut the chain yet. Add an additional link (outer/inner) to the total chain length. Cut the chain, install, and check the shifting function. Adjust the B-tension screw in on the derailleur so that the chain and upper jockey wheel on the derailleur do not grind against the largest rear cog. 

Yes, they are compatible. As long as you are using a 160mm caliper mount, and a 160m rotor they will work together. There are industry-wide standards for rotor position for front and rear brakes. Like @Carel says above though: make sure your pads are a type that are correct for the rotor (this shouldn't be a problem with HRD rotors, you can use metallic or organic pads on them) and also compatible for the type of riding you are doing. For example, if you are doing tons of downhill with organic pads, you'll wear through them really quickly. 

They will not work at all. Use an 11-speed chain. If you use the 10spd chain, there is a good chance that it can: 

There are two possibilities: 1.) The roller brake mechanism and internals are completely seized. Based on the level of rust on the outside of the brake, there is a strong possibility that there is rust inside as well. Shimano roller brakes do need to be in fairly good condition, and have the correct Shimano grease in them to work well. If the brake had a very thick type of grease injected into it, it may have gummed up the brake completely. The Shimano Nexave roller brakes, are technically serviceable, but are not warrantied by Shimano if opened up. They are designed as a complete unit; replacement internals are not available, and must be scavenged from other brakes. Most shops will typically not service the internals; know that if a shop is willing to, there are no new parts going into the brake. Nexave brakes are fairly inexpensive, and any good shop should be able to supply you with a replacement, and install it as well. Despite my normal recommendations to overhaul existing equipment, this is one instance where replacement is the best route. 2.) You are possibly missing a spacer/locknut between the brake drum and the frame. While this is not your exact brake, the parts are similar. You may be missing item #2. It looks as though the end of the fork blade may be contacting the drum, and exerting pressure on the drum, preventing it from springing back. Be sure that there is the appropriate locknut holding the brake unit in place, and the over-locknut dimension is 100mm. This is only likely if the hub has been overhauled, and the brake was put on incorrectly, with the locknut missing. The reason the brake works while rolling backwards is that the drum is being pushed in the "open" direction, loosening the internals (from whatever is making them stick), and allowing the brake to operate normally. 

It seems I've made a few 'tiny' errors when choosing components to upgrade my bike. The biggest issues I'm facing at the moment are crankset and front derailleur... Bike is Eyble Psych 4 Black Edition (full suspension, 26" wheels) and I'm upgrading various (all) Shimano components to SLX. Because I'm not very familiar with all aspects of MTB geometry and compatibility of parts - I've put myself into weird position. I've chosen M677 crankset (2x10, 22-36t) which (if I get things right) dictates position/hight of front derailleur (SLX 765-B, 2x10, clamp type). I've installed FD provisionally and found out that it sit quite low on seat tube (seat tube is with top pull cable routing). FD clamp is almost touching the joint of seat tube, downtube and chainstays (which are asymmetric) and it could interfere with movement of rear end of bike. (I didn't put chain yet and I tried to compress rear shock all the way - and I didn't notice that FD is hitting anything.) Anyway, I'm worried if this setup is right and should I continue installing other parts? If this is horribly wrong - what are my options regarding another FD (please recommend proper FD type) or (preferably not) changing other components? PS. I know I should have informed myself better before buying things :D 

Problem Solvers makes a kit that is usually worth a shot to see if the post is completely shot and needs re-welding: Cantilever Stud Repair Kit You could probably even fabricate one yourself if you could find the right tubing diameter. We used these frequently at the shops I managed, and they have a roughly 50% success rate. Having them work properly is largely dependent on ensuring that the base of the original stud is cut and filed very flush and almost perfectly perpendicular to the bolt's orientation. If you install it successfully, great! You've only spent a few dollars, and you've got the bike back up and running. It's much cheaper than trying to get a new boss re-welded on. If this does not work, it's only a few dollars spent, and you can explore alternatives. Installation Instructions I would not really even recommend trying to have it re-welded, because it's pretty difficult for a welder (unless they're an experienced framebuilder with the correct jig setup) to get the boss lined up to the point that the posts are equidistant and oriented to exactly the same angle. Your second best option would be the long-ish caliper brake that RoboKaren suggested. Don't even consider those disc brake adapters; the chances for failure or misalignment (that leads to failure) is very high. Disc brakes are not a one-size-fits-all solution, and require much more precision than those adapters can supply. 

I'm not using SPD pedals anymore but I would try following to transfer cleat position to new shoes. I remembered that I've read somewhere that some shoe manufacturers have some kind of paper pattern to mark position of old cleats and use that pattern to adjust position for new cleats. Since I guess your shoe size iz the same for new pair, making this kind of paper pattern and marking where cleat starts/ends would be rather easy. In order to increase precission you can combine this with measuring it with ruler. Added: There are also products like Ergon TP1 Pedal Cleat Tool but I guess it's rather expensive for just one time use. 

I'm looking for an upgrade to my crankset and I would also like to replace bottom bracket. My current setup is Shimano M522 (3 x 10) which I would like to replace with SLX M677 (2 x 10) and current bottom bracket is First R30. Are there any compatible bottom brackets from Shimano that can fit in my bike frame (73 mm wide) and which will be compatible with SLX M677 crankset? Shimano recommends BB-MT800-PA as compatible press fit bottom bracket but according to specifications it is available in 89.5 - 93 mm. I'm confused about options and alternatives - please help. 

You are going at constant speed when the driving force from gravity Fg is equal to the drag (air resistance) Fd plus friction (rolling resistance) Ff: Fg = Fd + Ff When coasting down a hill, the driving force is the component of the gravitational force parallel to the road: Fg = m g sin(a) Here, a is the slope (angle with the horizontal), m is the mass of bike and rider, and g is the gravitational constant. Slopes on roads are often measured in percent, and for small angles sin(a) is equal to the slope in percent. e.g. for a slope of 10% (100m descent on 1km of road) sin(a) = 0.1. Drag is proportional to the square of the velocity v, the projected frontal area A and a drag coefficient cd, and the density of air rho: Fd = 1/2 rho v^2 cd A The drag coefficient cd depends on the shape of the object - streamlined bodies have a low cd, but for a bicycle with rider I find approximately cd = 1 in Wikipedia. I'd estimate the frontal area of a cyclist to about 0.4m^2. Friction (rolling resistance) is proportional to a coefficient cr and the normal force (the weight component perpendicular to the road) Fn = m g cos(a): Ff = cr m g cos(a) The coefficient of rolling resistance cr will depend on the bike (lubrication, tire pressure, surface roughness etc.). For car tires on concrete, Wikipedia gives cr=0.01, so the Ff would be about 10N. That's about a tenth of the driving force on a 10% slope (see above), but on a rough road surface it might well be much more. So we end up with m g sin(a) = Fg = Fd + Ff = 1/2 rho v^2 cd A + cr m g cos(a) Solving this for v gives: v^2 = 2 m g (sin(a) - cr cos(a) ) / (rho cd A) Putting in g=10m/s^2, rho=1.2kg/m^3, cd=1, A=0.4m^2, and m=100kg (nice round number for rider and bike), I get v = sqrt( sin(a)-cr cos(a) ) * 64 m/s The rolling resistance cr essentially is like reducing the slope somewhat, so a slope of 10%=0.1 with cr=0.01 is the same as a slope of 9% on a perfectly rolling bike. So, for a slope of 10%, the sqrt becomes 0.3, and I get a speed of 19m/s = 70km/h It's not unrealistic, but perhaps a bit faster than I would have expected. However, there are simplified assumptions, friction and rolling resistance is probably higher and cd and A have a big effect, they all depend on the bike and the rider. From the drag equation you can see why the racing position is with the head down. This position decreases the frontal area A considerable, compared to an upright position, and it makes the body somewhat more streamlined (reduces cd). As the drag goes with the square of the velocity, this gets more important at higher speed. 

A good option, if you can't shift any packed weight to the front of the bike, is to lean forward over the handlebars while climbing. You'll distribute your weight more equally between the wheels and avoid lifting the front wheel. Be sure to have the bike in the lowest gear before you start the climb, and just spin all the way up the hill. You will move slower, but the bike will stay stable, and is actually a little more efficient in terms of energy expenditure. This will require a stronger core, so if you find it difficult at first, add a couple sets of front and side ab crunches to your morning routine. There may not be a perfect solution to this depending on how much rear weight you are carrying. If it's really a lot of weight, the only good solution may be front mounted carrying systems like panniers or a front basket/bag. 

It's called a stem clamp binder nut. The names don't get more specific than that, unfortunately. You could search for the bolt by the stem name, and maybe get lucky finding another one. It's not a super-common setup for stems; they typically used a hex nut. If it doesn't fit a little further into the stem, it's most likely an incorrect size for the stem. The flange should sit flush when the bolt is fully tightened. The binder bolt thread only comes in a few sizes, so you may just have a bolt that "works" but is not original to the stem. 

It seems quite clear to me that the driver should not have pulled up to the right of you, which is essentially an overtaking manoeuvre, if he intended to turn left, no matter what you were planning. 

I'm not sure weight is the main issue. There are several questions on this site from people weighing more than you, and the general advice seems to be that it should be fine. Sure, more weight puts bike under more stress, but bikes are generally fairly sturdy. But make sure that there are no missing spokes, and check regularly if there are cracks in the rim or the wheel buckles; if so, perhaps replace it with a sturdier mountain bike wheel. I don't quite understand your liner and that might well be the main issue. I would just get a good, puncture-proof tire, and a new tube, and not use anything else. My experience: I used a proper kevlar tire liner for a while, but had many punctures too. It is very difficult to align the liner properly inside the tire, and it can move and pinch the tire. After several punctures I just took it out, got good new tires, and that's it. I don't understand the way you make your own liner out of old tires, but this is really difficult to do properly and you may well create sharp edges or pinch points that damage the tube. With a good tyre, you don't need another liner between tire and tube at all. It seems that you already checked for damages in the rim or spokes that stick out, and make sure the rim tape (the plastic that goes around the rim over the spoke nipples) is in good condition. Keep the tire well inflated near the maximum (the number is printed on the sidewall). If it's underinflated, the tube can move or get pinched when you go over a kerb for example, and that will also lead to damage. Finally, observe carefully where and how you ride. Perhaps there are locations where you go over a kerb or road damage, and if you take that too fast, it can damage your wheels. 

I'm doing complete overhaul and service of my bike and it is time to service Manitou Minute fork and Manitou Radium shock. They both work fine but they have never been serviced (at least for two years as long as I have this bike, and I think they are 2012 or 2013 models :). Problem is, there is no specialized service for Manitou products in my country and there are no replacement parts available. My options are limited to taking my shocks to Fox/RockShox service but they have no replacement parts for Manitou and I guess I can expect they'll be able to clean all parts and change oil. 

I'm planning to take my bike on this year vacation but I have certain dilemmas where and how to keep bike secure during my stay. Bike is nothing fancy (MTB, 26" wheels, full suspension bike with Manitou shocks, aluminum frame, new SLX groupset, Fox DOSS seat post...) more of a sentimental value because I put too much work and effort in maintaing it. First of all, I'm staying at a hotel which doesn't have secure room for storing bikes and management doesn't allow keeping bikes in room or on balcony. Hotel only has bike racks at the entrance to each hotel wing (some of theme are covered with 'security' cameras) and most guest keep their bikes locked there. At night, those racks are in dark and I have no idea if I'll be able to see it from my room. My concern is that by keeping my bike with other bikes (usually cheaper ones), it will stick out and be nice 'target' due to higher end parts and components. The other option is to keep bike inside my car on unsecured parking lot (no street light, no surveillance) which is even further away from hotel and my car has no alarm to hear if someone tries to open it. My bike will be unattended during night, and most of the day while not riding it (meals, going on beach...) I also considered leaving my bike at home and renting bike but prices are outrageous - so it isn't an option. To be honest, at the moment I'm still searching for a decent bike lock so I have yet to solve that part of a problem (and I'm probably little paranoid when it comes to bikes). Any ideas and suggestions how to secure bike (and enjoy vacation) are more than welcome.
