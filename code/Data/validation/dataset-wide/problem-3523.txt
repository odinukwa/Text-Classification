My guess is that the ''elasticity of substitution'' means something like$$\frac{\%\Delta K}{\% \Delta L}=\mathrm{mrs} \times\frac lk, $$ but that is dependant on what point you are at (i.e. a coordinate $(l, k)$). To get $\mathrm{mrs} $, find $\frac {\mathrm d k} {\mathrm d l} $, and even that is dependent on the value of $f$. 

I would like to find out what goods are compared across countries in the International Comparison Programme in order to calculate purchasing power parities. I know there are possibly thousands of specific types of products that are looked at, but I just want to get an idea of what the products are or to look at a list of the products. Please link to the source. 

The straight-line supply and demand curves can be thought of as a magnification of this graph, where the two intersect. Thus, the units on the axes would give you a clue as to how high up the graph is being drawn, or how far to the right (if the units start at a number other than 0 or skip an interval). This shows you why they are indeed called 'curves', even when they are sometimes straight lines. Supply and demand curves are drawn using straight lines for simplicity. For example, two straight-line equations may be given, from which it is relatively simple to calculate the point of intersection. In the real world Supply and demand curves are an approximation of what happens in real life. The curves are a simplified model which show the general trend in the two functions. In reality, supply and demand curves are approximated using data that is collected over many years, with many short-term variables affecting the results, if the curves are even drawn up at all (the curves are more a theoretical model than a calculative method). Economic factors which affect supply and demand 

The objective of printing money is to respond to inflation, not to keep up with changes in GDP. If the inflation rate is high and the stock of money in the economy remains constant, the real amount of money will decrease as the value of money will decrease. ("Real" has a specific definition in economics that you should try to learn. It refers to the inherent value a good has, regardless of the nominal number of rupees that someone says the good is worth.) In studying economics, you will become aware that real fluctuations often matter much more than nominal fluctuations of economic variables. By that I mean that the inherent value of goods and services (what is actually produced) matters more than numbers that try to describe their value. Unfortunately, because of inflation, the numbers that we come up with about something like the stock of money do not give as much useful information compared to the real stock of money. So, we are concerned about the real stock of money, and inflation erodes that, which is why more money must be printed in order for the real stock of money to be kept constant. I have a personal aversion towards talking freely about "printing" money, because I think it obfuscates the much more nuanced and complicated process of money supply than simply asking a machine to print some notes. "Printing" money actually refers to money supply. The main component of that process is that the central bank buys bonds and other securities, thereby increasing the amount of liquidity in the financial market, and driving down interest rates. As interest rates go down, consumers and businesses have less incentive to save, so their consumption and expenditure will increase, along with an increase in demand for more liquid forms of money, one of which is physical currency. 

Reading my development economics textbook, I was informed that the opportunity cost of a private investment is the market value of the wages, goods and services used for the investment. Here's a hypothetical situation: suppose that the firm could invest in an alternative project with the same amount of resources but a higher return. Would it not be myopic to overlook this alternative investment when asserting that the opportunity cost is the market value of inputs? It leads me to wonder why the inputs weren't valued higher. It could be because others in the market don't have access to capital, knowledge of the opportunity or the expertise required to make the investment. Still, why would the opportunity cost not be the income that could potentially be created from the alternative investment? Is a 'market value' approach just a simplification? 

Profit is revenue minus costs. So we have $q = 12500$ and $p = 35$. (Note that I'm assuming you've correctly figured this out.) Then we have revenue: $$R = \int_{0}^{12500} MR dq = \int_{0}^{12500} (60 - 0.004q)dq$$ And costs: $$C = 300000 + \int_{0}^{12500} 10dq = 300000 + 125000 = 425000$$ The profit is $\Pi = R - C$. The average cost is $C/12500$. I leave you to crunch the integrals. Edit: In looking at your problem, $p(q) = 60 - 0.002q$ is definitely an inverse demand function. The revenue $R = qp(q) = (60q - 0.002q^{2})$ (quantity times prices). This yields the profit maximization problem (maximizing with respect to quantity produced): $$\max_{q} qp(q) - c(q) = (60q - 0.004q^{2}) - 10q - 300000$$ The First Order Conditions are: $$60 - 0.004q - 10 = 0 \implies 60 -0.004q = 10$$ You did the work from there to solve for $q$. 

In equilibrium, we have supply equal to demand. So $Q_{s} = Q_{d} \implies 50 = 2p$, so $p^{*} = 25$ is the equilibrium price. Consumer surplus is defined as: $$\int_{p^{*}}^{p_{max}} Q_{d}(p) dp$$ Here, $p_{max} = 50$, as $Q_{s} = 0$ when $p = 50$. So evaluate the integral. Producer surplus is similarly defined as: $$\int_{0}^{p^{*}} Q_{s}(p) dp$$ 

Let's look at this with backward induction. Let $v_{i}$ be my valuation and $v_{-i}$ be your valuation. Suppose I've won the item. Then $v_{i} \geq v_{-i}$. If I sell you the item at price $v_{-i}$, then my utility is $v_{-i} - b_{i} \leq v_{i} - b_{i}$, where $b_{i}$ is my bid according to the symmetric equilibrium bidding strategy (which may not necessarily be $\beta$). Notice that I do not gain $v_{i}$ by selling you the item, as I do not possess it. We see that I will never have incentive to sell you the item. So I should bid as if I'm not going to sell you the item. We have an equilibrium bidding strategy for this anyways, given by the first price auction. 

I did my undergraduate double majoring in discrete mathematics and economics. I went through the grad micro sequence, the math for economists grad course, and the game theory field course, though. So I have a good idea of what the courses are like on both ends. (Doing the grad school route now, but that's additional commentary with which I won't bore everyone). Traditionally, coursework like abstract Linear Algebra and Number Theory have been used by math departments to teach proof writing. In the last 15-20 years, an Intro to Proofs class has been added. Number theory doesn't come up appreciably in economics. So I'd punt that. But a solid course in linear algebra is so important. And if you have a strong data science background, then you should be very comfortable with the material, though perhaps not the formalization. Real analysis is the maturity sequence in the math departments. Rudin is the standard textbook. If you take it, expect to be putting in a solid 20 hours per week, but you will be razor sharp by the end of it. Real analysis is usually a senior or introductory grad sequence. There is often times an introductory analysis class that uses a text like Abbott. This introductory class is still something you shouldn't take lightly, but it should be much easier and sufficient for a lot of what you'll do in economics. If you are working in stochastic processes, martingales, etc., then measure is likely to come up, and so you should take the Rudin sequence at some point and follow it up with measure theory (which is a very tough grad course). The math for economists course compresses much of these courses (usually not measure) into a semester. When I took it, we trucked through the abstract linear algebra semester-long course in three weeks. It was also an ugly presentation, but that's what happens when you push for speed rather than elegance. And this is one more reason why you should take these courses in the math department. Combinatorics and graph theory is also becoming increasingly important in economics, with regards to networks. So a course in graph theory wouldn't hurt either. Graph theory proofs are picky in the sense that you have to be very precise in saying "because it looks like it." This is different than analysis and algebra proofs. Graph theory is my particular area, so I can definitely speak to it. A course in analysis of algorithms or theory of computation wouldn't be a bad thing to have either, with complexity becoming increasingly important in economics (algorithmic mechanism design, algorithmic game theory, strategic network formation, showing computing equilibria is computationally difficult for certain classes of games, etc.). To sum it up, I'd strongly recommend: Abstract Linear Algebra Intro to Real Analysis I'd recommend you consider: Real Analysis (Rudin) Measure Theory Nice to Have courses: Graph Theory Combinatorics Theory of Computation Analysis of Algorithms Let me know if you want book recommendations for any of these courses.
