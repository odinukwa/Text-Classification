cutting out parts of brains to see what stops working when you do. accidental brain injuries have taught us a lot about how brains work, you just do the same thing systematically. 

sounds like mixed unit tactics would work best, knocking a squad down is not all that destructive, knocking them down just as they get ready to stop a cavalry charge would be lethal. One mage with 100 wind spells combined with cavalry would be a meat grinder. Knock arrows out of the sky now only your side has archers. Or combine them with fire throwers and create a wildfire. Turn solid ground to mud under your enemies feet to break up formations and charges. Fight during a storm so your mage can turn lighting against your enemy. Mages that can bend light would make terrific scouts. Mages would be a nightmare during siege they could collapse walls by breaking keystones or cornerstones. Being able to change the wind during naval battles would all but guarantee victory. How much energy would making the enemy commander's helmet shirt and crush his skull take? Mages would also be instant targets so having them protected by other troops would be important. As for duels a good trick might be creating a invisible bubble around your opponents head that lets no new air move in, they would feel fatigued and wozzy and would eventually kill them, even if they did figure it out a gasping disoriented fighter is easy to kill. Or just pull the air away from their head and watch the vacuum effect knock them unconscious or collapse their lungs. Or for a more direct approach combine force of mind with force of body, add your mental power to a sword swing on top of muscle power, 

It really depends on what part of the metabolism it takes it from. If they burn more sugar and fat becasue it's sucking heat (most of the calories we burn is for heat) most likely you are going to cool the person and could easily lead to hypothermia. Patrick Rothfuss actually uses this idea in his book the Name of the Wind. It can be solved by eating well and not overdoing it. you can also help by wearing warm clothing and warming the body artificially, say with a fire or hot bath. If it is somehow converting the sugar or destroying it directly, then you have more potent effects, specifically in brain tissue which consumes the most (although not fat just sugar) People will be lethargic and tired regardless of how much sugar they eat, becasue it will take time to rebalance sugar levels and get rid of the byproducts. extended use could easily lead to ketosis (if they don't massively increase sugar intake) or diabetes (if they do) 

Some of the first known form of writing were records of debt and trade, They used clay tablets, tallies could stamped or carved into the tablet which could then be fired to become hard ceramics. Clay was cheap and common since it was used to make bricks and pottery. Keep in mind such records were only used for large transactions in which debt was involved, as much for legal record as anything else. There was no reason to keep any other records as most store owner would know what they had and what they needed. Daily tallies or such short term records could be kept on carved wax tables or charcoal on wood since they could be reused over and over. By the middle periods paper was a lot cheaper, more than enough to be used for records. you can see some examples and more information here. $URL$ 

I can think of why the tree would do this, consider the chili pepper, the capsasin discourages large mammals that can digest their seeds so only birds (who are not affected) will eat them and spread their seeds. Now imagine your tree produces a strong charge in its fruit, birds would be unaffected but and large animal standing on the ground that tried to eat the fruit would get a shock because it completes a circuit with the ground. Now we have a reason your plant has such weird fruit it wants birds to eat it but not large animals becasue they can break down their seeds and birds can't. As for how it does this this is not too hard cell membranes can make good capacitors, your plant just needs to stack an incredible amount of cell membranes together and build up a charge potential across them. Also consider that teeth are very electrosensitive (it has to do with how teeth first evolved), so this will work doubly well on most mammals, it may not even need that strong of a charge. this also means that once the fruit has discharged it will take time to build up a charge again, so a clever human could figure out how to harvest them safely. 

Your assumptions about what defines those groups is wrong. Unless your organisms are descended from earth life they would not have any earth domains (so they can't be bacteria), it would have it's own superdomain (insert name here) as it is not earth life. All earth life falls inside the Biota superdomain. They would then have all their own domains, phylum, etc under this superdomain. if they are descended from earth life then they just fall into the existing schema. Within that shema the number of cells is not a factor, there are multicellular archaea and bacteria. what they are descended from is what would matter. If they are both genetically identical and descended from bacteria, then they are bacteria just a multicellular bacteria. If they are genetically distinct then you ask whether they can survive independently and whether they reproduce together, if neither can survive independently and they reproduce as a single unit they might well be considered the same organism. You also have to decide where each part comes from, if they are distantly related then you might well get a new grouping name, and a new domain is not a bad choice. 

First some basic considerations. The human has to stop using urea for excreting nitrogen It has to switch to uric acid otherwise the egg will be the size of an SUV to contain enough water. hard shelled eggs take up more space than the offspring in passing so females need much wider hips. Shape, you have several shapes to work with for hard shelled eggs: ovoid/elliptical, elongate, spherical, or tear-drop. see examples in image. A human fetus will fit best in a ovoid/elliptical egg or weakly teardrop egg with the least wasted space (and thus least unneeded egg width) so one of those is the most likely shape. Ostrich sized is not a bad ballpark if you go th egg laying marsupial route, based on human infant survivability. 

there is an online calculator for kinetic weapons and lasers, both are however in a vacuum. $URL$ $URL$ 

There is only one way to eliminate it completely a complete lack of scarcity, (which is probably impossible) only in a post-scarcity society would it not occur. As long as humans want sex and humans want things, prostitution will exist. If you are trying to just minimize it you may want to adjust your question. 

in order to translate nuance, subtext and handle contextual meaning a universal translator would have to be an AI. capable of actually understanding the language not just an algorithm. Such an AI would be able to break the simplest encryption (substitution, ciphers, ect) relatively easily, but more advanced encryption would just as hard for it as it would for humans. If you want really hard science ideally both sides would need their own UT which would communicate together at high speed to learn each language. simply not having one on each side would make it much harder and require cooperation. 

It is possible to manufacture them, but there is not much point. You can melt down asteroids and make whatever shape you want, assuming it was not big enough to collapse under its own gravity in the first place. You get better use out of the material by building spheres or cylinders, plus they are a lot easier to make, and flat is only useful if you're organisms do not need gravity but still wants a flat surface (so nothing like multicellular life on earth) or you have cheap reliable artificial gravity. The only real reason to make them is showing off. 

Normally. If you are touching the copper during most of the "forging" process you are doing it wrong and there is no point when you have to touch it with your skin. The most common early copper tools, the axe and adze, are still completely usable by them. spears, sickles and swords would still be usable, as would knives for some applications. they would not be wearing copper jewelry no using copper cookware but they would still have plenty of uses for it. they might even have MORE reason to use for copper, at least in warfare. If taking a shallow cut a sword caused a person to go into anaphylactic shock we would probably still be using them. 

The effect on their culture will be minimal. Although if you include #2 they may find non-green skinned people look sickly or ugly. 

The two rules of thumb are the better hidden it is the harder it is to get it in a hurry, and the better a weapon it is the harder it is to hide. nearly every place on the body is an option, the back between the shoulder blades, under the arm in the small of the back, on the forearm, on the upper arm, the belly , on or inside belts, inside girdles and sashes, the crotch, inside and outside the thigh, the shin or calf, inside the side of a boot, inside the heel of a boot. Then there are the off the body options blades have been hidden in all sorts of objects: umbrellas, brushes, makeup and sniff tins, canes, buckles, jewelry, candles, lanterns, hats, even inside food and drink. but consider that you were expected to defend yourself and carry a weapon in most societies, plus you needed a knife for everything and it was often the only eating utensil so not carrying one was weird. If anything Not carrying a knife openly might make people suspicious of you, after all they knew you had one so why were you hiding it? so consider having a open carry weapon and making concealed ones back ups. a merchant in bandit country is likely going to have a weapon openly carried and available, a belt knife at least, why hide it? Plus merchants often wore layers of clothing and would have to carry a money purse and scales so hiding things is easy. Consider a jambiya, they were popular in the middle east for both the one handed draw and being unobtrusive. As for your lady consider a purse knife or sash knife also remember you were expected to bring your own utensils to meals (they were not provided) so even to a dinner party she would still be expected to have a knife. As for your thug unless he is in prison he would be allowed a knife, it might be partially hidden by putting it inside the belt instead of on top but that's about it. A thug would likely have little more than simple pants and tunic which does not provide many hiding places so he might be stuck with the boot knife if he has to hide something.
