Let me fail to answer your question by asking another question -- what do we GAIN by drawing the distinction? By "ironing out" the distinctions, we can avoid having to postulate quite different grammatical architectures for polysynthetic vs. analytic languages, and we can capture the fact that there are generalizations across these languages. If we have distinct notions of morphology and syntax, the fact that subjects and objects agree with the verb in certain ways regardless of whether there's a word boundary between them or not is completely accidental. Put differently, why should we have phonological atoms be the same as syntactic/semantic atoms at the cost of generality across typologically distinct languages? Remember, although it gets debated a lot in various circles in Linguistics, the standard analyses of verbal morphology in English has pretty much always been syntactic at its core in the Chomskyan generative enterprise since LSLT! 

Periphrastic forms with "have" are fairly common -- one might think of "have to" in "I have to win" (and its Spanish equivalent, "Tengo que ganar"!) as auxiliaries, and all of the future tenses in Romance are formed from a verb followed by an inflected form of the word "have" in Latin. In any event, if I remember correctly, the way that the English present perfect was formed was via reanalysis of constructions like "I have the cat fed", in which "have" is the lexical verb, and "fed" is some kind of secondary predicate of the noun "cat". It's not too hard to see why it got used as a present perfect -- the "have" is expressing that the state is taking place now, and the past participle form "fed" expresses that the relevant event is completed. I imagine that Portuguese probably went through a different trajectory to get the meaning it has, or it followed a similar trajectory, and then semantically drifted to where it is now. Someone would need to check the facts, though. 

Actually, there is supposed to be a universal ordering of adjectives. Oddly, languages either have the exact same ordering as English, or the exact opposite as English. And, nouns in various languages fall in some designated position between the string of adjectives -- in English it's at the end, in Romance languages it's somewhere in the middle, such that most adjectives follow the noun, but certain adjectives precede. Guglielmo Cinque is the big name here, who has written a book articulating this idea, called The Syntax of Adjectives (in addition to working on it in a number of papers) 

This same phenomenon appears in many other ON words, such as tǫnn 'tooth', from Proto-Germanic *tanþs, gunnr 'war' from *gunþiz, munnr 'mouth' from *munþaz. (Note that English instead lost the /n/.) 

B-underline (the Wikipedia page used an actual underline; I added an underline diacritic since Markdown doesn't allow underline): 

This is a common process called lenition. Consider a language that has a phoneme /b/ as its only voiced bilabial phoneme. Speakers will then often pronounce /b/ without complete closure of the airway, giving a fricative [β] or approximant [β̞] realization. A very similar phenomenon occurs in Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan, where intervocalic /b/ is realized as [β̞]. For example, Spanish bobo /ˈbo.bo/ will be pronounced [ˈbo.β̞o]. Japanese similarly often realizes /b/ as /β/. In this case, the (voiced bilabial) stop turns into an approximant. Kyrgyz lacks a /w/ phoneme, so there is no need to distinguish /b/ from /w/. Since the bilabial approximant [β̞] sounds similar to the bilabial-velar approximant [w], it is not surprising that [w] is another possible realization. Such shifting between various labial sounds and [w] is very common cross-linguistically; examples include: 

Articulatorily, velarization and pharyngealization are distinct, but they are often conflated in linguistic analyses I've seen: 

How much of a functional load must a phone carry to be considered its own phoneme? For example, my idiolect of English has a marginally distinctive glottal stop. However, it exists distinctively in only two words I can think of, both interjections: 

Yes. Korean [kor] There are roughly 2,000,000 Koreans living in China. Ethnologue lists 1,920,000 Korean speakers in China as of the 2000 census. (Not sure whether that counts North Korean refugees.) Korean is an isolate (assuming you don't accept it as Altaic). Wikipedia says, "With over 78 million speakers, Korean has more speakers than all other language isolates combined." So Korean wins. Chinese Sign Language [csl] Wikipedia lists it as an isolate. There are probably other local sign language isolates, presumably undocumented or poorly documented. ISO 639-3 considers it two languages, the other being hks. List See also Wikipedia's partial list. 

The Wikipedia article "Aramaic of Jesus" contains many instances of transliterated Aramaic, using a system I have not seen before. Some of the notations are well-established, like ŝ for /ʃ/ and macrons for long vowels, but there are many I haven't seen before. I tried looking up more information on Aramaic transcription systems. Wikipedia has no article on Aramaic transcription, and the articles on Aramaic, Romanization of Hebrew, and various Hebrew letters don't seem to have any relevant information. Particularly T-cedilla: 

There seems to be little doubt that the origin is a Slavic nickname. This is because in ancient times it was very common among Slavs to give nicknames in addition to the official name received at baptism. In case of the Cossacks, this had security reasons in order to hide their origin from oppressing forces. The result was a huge number of nicknames, which subsequently became the basis for surnames. (2) Most sources seem to agree that the most likely origin for the name is the Slavic word "baba", which can mean old women, grandmother, witch, and midwife. This latter can indicate that the word was used as a metonymy referring to an occupation or job. The -iak part at the end is a diminutive or augmentative. (4) I. Ukrainian link Surnames like "Баб'як" (Bab'jak) and "Бабяк" (ba'bjak) are common in Ukraine. (1,4) I.1. The surname Babiak may have its origin in the old common nickname "baba", a married woman of the lower classes. (2) I.2. Other possibility is the word "бабак", which refers to the bobak marmot aka steppe marmot. This nickname could have been given to sedentary, thick, or lonely people living an unsociable, introverted lifestyle. (2) I.3. Other origin may be the word "бабка", which means dragonfly. (1) II. Polish link Babiak exists in Polish. (3) II.1. The root can be the word "baba", meaning woman, old woman, or hag. "Babiak" may have originated as a variant of "babiarz" (womaniser, skirt-chaser). Alternatively, it may have been a matronymic tag for the bastard son of an unwedded lass. (3) II.2. The surname may have been formed from the male baptismal name "Baba", which was very common in Poland in the XIV century. Many variants derived from this origin, and are often found in documents: Novgorod peasant Iwashko Babin, 1495; Moscow homeowner Gregory Babin, 1504 (2) III. Slovak link "Babiak" and "Babiák" can be found in the Slovak language. (4) III.1. "baba" means old woman; can be used as derogatory term for gutless men. (5) III.2. Other sources suggest the origin word to be "bob" (beans) or "bobo" (bogeyman). (5) The Hungarian environment may have caused the "o" to transform into "a", however this is unlikely as "Bobiak" cannot be found in contemporary Slovak.

However, it used to be employed as a term of affection as well between lovers and newly weds - much like in English. Many Hungarian folk songs contain the term "babám" (my baby) often referring to young women. However, contemporary Hungarian shuns this expression as it is considered archaic. On the other hand, "bába" means midwife, a term still used occasionally. Some traditional Hungarian folk fairy tales refer to the recurring character of the witch as "vasorrú bába" (iron nosed old women). 

In your particular example, treating it as /CCV/ is more likely, since it's uncommon for languages to permit 3 obstruents in the onset, but /CCCV/ is also possible. 

In addition to slashes and square brackets, sometimes also used are double-slashes, pipes, and angle brackets. Their uses are: 

Applying this rule to *finþanan gives *finþa. Assimilation of /nþ/ to /nn/ This is also a regular sound change in Old Norse. According to Marisa Lohr, one of its characteristic innovations is: 

The Russian text is a song about cutting reeds. It seems to have nothing to do with the Yoruba words or the Portuguese lyrics. 

It depends on the language, and how you choose to analyze it. In the phonetic sense, an affricate is a consonant cluster consisting of a stop that is released directly into a fricative, with no intervening release burst before the start of the fricative. Affricates may or may not be phonemic; that depends on whether the affricate behaves phonologically/phonotactically as an indivisible unit. An example is the cluster [tˢs]. In Japanese, it patterns as a phonemic unit; in fact, it alternates with (compare [matsu] waits with [mata] waited), and is often considered an allophone of, the single phoneme /t/. In contrast, in English, [tˢs] is a sequence of 2 phonemes rather than a phoneme, because it patterns like the sequence /t/ + /s/ (in words like cats /kæts/ the /t/ and /s/ belong to different morphemes, so /ts/ is clearly not a unitary phoneme). Another case is [tɕ] in Russian. This is clearly a phonemic affricate: because Russian doesn't even have a phoneme /ɕ/, it's not even possible to analyze it as a sequence. Whether to consider a (phonetic) affricate as two separate consonants in the onset depends on whether you are considering it as a non-phonemic sequence. Phonotactic considerations can also guide you here. Example: /tʃ/ in Spanish. There are 2 arguments that this should be considered a single consonant in the onset: 

Surprisingly, it appears they are related, cognate to Frank. The Wikipedia article that Alex B. linked gives an etymology for the Russian фря́зин /ˈfrʲa.zʲin/. It derives from the older form фрѧ́зин /ˈfrɛ̃.zʲin/ (following loss of nasality of ѧ and a spelling reform). This is a sound-changed version of /ˈfrɛ̃ɡʲin/ by progressive palatalization; this derives from Frank + /ʲin/, a suffix for ethnonyms. The Thai ฝรั่ง [faràŋ] is reportedly also derived from Frank, via Arabic, Persian, or Sanskrit (various forms like Farangi, Faranj). Cognate terms were used by Middle Eastern traders to refer to the Catholic Western Europeans. Southeast Asian languages have numerous borrowings along that route, so this etymology is plausible. See also Wikipedia's list of cognate terms, which includes similar terms in many nearby languages (Indic languages, Malay, Cambodian). It also appears in Star Trek. (Not related to English foreign, which is coincidentally similar.)
