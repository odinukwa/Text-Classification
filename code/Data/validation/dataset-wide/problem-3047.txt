Technically speaking "flat glass" was introduced by the Romans as glass for construction of window panes. These were produced as early as the first century CE, and is commonly found in Roman sites in Britain as well. Pieces as large as 30 by 40 inches have also been uncovered at Pompeii. Such early windows were usually quite small, of irregular thickness, and not clear or transparent. These flat panes may have been produced using one of several different processes. One suggested method is "cast glass". This produced glass of uneven thickness, with one side having a polished or "glossy" surface and the other side a matt finish. Although the exact technique is lost, it is suggested that they were produced by pouring molten glass into a mold. Another method suggested is casting of soft, hot glass on a flat surface and then pressing it into flatness with a moist, wooden mallet. Contemporary glassmakers have been able to re-produce glass panes in this method, and the results closely match the original Roman panes. Another method used by the Romans for the production of window glass was called the "crown method". First a hollow sphere was blown at the end of a blowpipe. Then the end opposite the blowpipe was opened. The opened, soft sphere was then vigorously rotated. The centrifugal force would flatten out the glass into a disk. The disc was then cooled and cut into small sheets. Every disk had a lump of glass at the center, known as the "bull’s eye" or "crown". Although another source clearly mentions that crown glass method was invented in the eighth century in Syria: 

On farm animals: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bunker-Type Fallout Shelter for Beef Cattle, Miscellaneous Publication no. 947 (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1964). This government publication notes that “this shelter provides low-cost and adequate radiation protection for unattended farm animals. Although designed primarily for beef cattle, the shelter could be modified for use by sheep, hogs, or poultry.” Source- One Nation Underground: The Fallout Shelter in American Culture 

The Period in question: Between 221 B.C.E and 220 C.E. the Qin Dynasty and the following Han Dynasty brought significant technological advancements and government policies relating to agriculture that affected China for two thousand years. 

McCluskieganj/McCluskiegunj was a town created out of several villages to secure a place for Anglo-Indians. Disambiguation: By Anglo-Indians I mean it in the way it has been used since the Indian census of 1911, i.e a domiciled community of mixed descent, who were formerly known as Eurasian, country-born or half-caste, and not as in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when it referred to the British in India. Ernest Timothy McCluskie, a land and house agent from Calcutta, founded the Colonization Society of India Ltd in 1933 in Calcutta with the idea of establishing an Anglo-Indian refuge, where their racial insecurities could be put to rest. This is thus several years before India's independence, under British rule, but within the context of imminent independence, when the British would leave. It has been described as: 

This seems to be the rulers' method of "divide and rule", and largely to prevent the Congress from getting too strong: 

See this So it seems a balance between a "small" number - already known- such as 5, and a slightly larger 12, as base was ultimately arrived at- the number being 10. Another point to add to your question: 

The Kargil sector of the Line of Control covering the Mushkoh valley, Dras, Kaksar, Chhainikund, Shingo Batalik and Chorbat La, because of the terrain, was not manned in detail and around the year. There were gaps between brigades providing security to the Siachen region and brigades responsible for security at Kargil and Gurez. India believed that the composition of the Buddhist-Shia population of the area would be a natural preventive against any extensive Pakistani military intrusion. However, India claimed that Pakistani forces came across the Line of Control all along the 140-kilometre stretch, penetrating into Indian territory to a depth of 10 to 12 kilometres between March and May 1999. When challenged by India, Pakistan argued that it had not crossed into Indian territory, that the Line of Control in this sector was not clearly demarcated or delineated. 

The population of India during the British Raj days was first counted during the census of 1871. Prior to this a full census and data on British subjects were not available. The 1891 census also did a linguistic division, but nothing such as "British Subjects". But people who spoke English as a mother tongue returned 238,409. The total Number of people with English as mother tongue, in India in 1891 as per the 1891 census was 238,409. The total Number of British subjects in India in 1921 as per the 1921 census was 165,485. The 1931 census was was the last census that was not subject to inaccuracies. The 1941 census was hampered by war and self-return from an illiterate populace. 

It is a broad statement, and difficult to prove in terms of practicing Buddhism in the as opposed to being patronized by monarchs. In fact Amartya Sen makes it amply clear in his book that he refers to the fact that everyone, including Chinese travelers, referred to the subcontinent as a "Buddhist Kingdom". However, Buddhism did flourish from 6th century BC. Here is one point of view that is in line with Amartya Sen's: 

At the end of the nineteenth century attempts were on to draw a flat sheet of glass directly, to avoid the second step of flattening the cylinder. The first successful method was invented by Emile Fourcault in Belgium, who took a patent in 1904. Around the same time, two methods for sheet glass drawing were developed in America. These were the Colburn, or Libbey-Owens, process and the Pittsburgh process. These processes are still in use, the most successful being the Pittsburgh process. Several refinements and processes have been made since the seventeenth century in France, Germany, and the United States. 

Different groups rose and fell through the ages, gaining political and military power, and hence controlling the trade along the Silk Road. Trade along the Silk Road was at its zenith during the Tang dynasty due to the stability of the government. The travelers along the Silk Road changed over time. Chinese, Yuezhi, Bactrians, Indians, and Sogdians were the first to create the historical Silk Road in Central Asia in the first century BC. In time Muslim powers came to control large parts of the road. 

Edit: Additional Information on "Babylonian" Mathematics Much of Babylonian Math tablets comes from "House F", a scribal school: 

Travelers joined caravans to benefit from safety in numbers and experience of the caravaneers gathered from their previous trips. 

There were in fact several encounters between Fransiscan friars and Buddhists. Whether it resulted in transfer of "mysticism" can be questioned, but as with all religions, mixing and absorption of ideas is quite likely. Willem van Ruysbroeck, a Flemish Franciscan friar, spent six months in 1254 in Karakorum. In his "Itinirarium" he describes accurately Tibetan lamas. He also quotes the chant "Om mani padme hum" (Ou man haetavi or On man baccam, Sinica Franciscana). Pope Nicholas IV sent Friar John of Monte Corvino (1247-1328) to China. He arrived in Khanbaliq (Peking) in 1294. He lived for several years in China. From here he sent two letters, the first dated 8 January 1305, the second 13 February 1306, in which he mentions Buddhists. In 1328 the Franciscan friar Odoric de Pordenone arrived in Peking. In 1330 he returned to Padua where he dictated the story of his travels which resulted in the book "Relatio". The last papal envoy is John Marignolli who was sent to China in 1339 by Pope Benedict XII. He arrived in Khanbaliq in 1342 where he remained for three years. He returned in 1352 via Ceylon, another Buddhist country. 

India and Pakistan have been designated as countries who not only have the ability, but also the intent to use the bomb. (I hope this is not true). But rhetoric and high drama apart, India has always considered the military regime in Pakistan as a dangerous element, with a definitive history of actively engaging beyond their borders, such as with their "Strategic Depth" doctrine. India, on the other hand has been known to be a laggard and ambivalent in its Nuclear doctrine after Independence. While Nehru, the Prime Minister favoured a Non-Nuclear world, Bhabha, the man behind the nuclear technology in India, clearly preferred weaponization. 

The Chinese have a Chinese calendar. In India there are several Calendars. For practical purposes, the Indian Government and all commercial establishments follow the Gregorian calendar- to "synch" with the rest of the world. It makes scientific sense to follow UTC and a standard that is universal. That's how the globalized system works. But local cultures follow local customs and festivities on the basis of local calendars. That I guess is a fact all over the "non-western" world. 

Addendum: Marco Polo's book has extensive mention and descriptions of Buddhists, which is in the same period, although no direct Fransiscan connection is documented in his work. But it seems clear that contact between Europe and the Orient was well established. Also, the Italian Franciscan friar John of Pian di Carpino left Lyons in 1245 reaching Central Mongolia the following year. In 1247 he returned to France and wrote the "Tstoria Mongalorum". He mentions the religion of the Kitai. But Henri de Lubac asserts that these were Confucianists and not Buddhists that the friar met. In later years Christianity (Missionaries) had innumerable well documented contacts with Buddhism, but these were (as far as i understand) not with Franciscan friars as such.

Keep in mind though that there was no such thing as "Hindu" in those days. This term is an Arabic/Persian term used to describe the people east of the Indus. The Brahmanic traditions came into formalised existence as an umbrella religion (also as per Amartya Sen's book) much later, although diverse groups existed. The same can be said about early Buddhism. 

The premise of the question is incorrect. is most certainly and very much prevalent in South India, along with Islam, Christianity, and many other religions. There is no such thing as . If there was such a thing in ancient times, it is a highly debated and contentious issue. Genetics and many other modern tools seem to suggest that these are constructs - just like race. So if the question is with reference to religion- there is no religion called . If it is a racial question- I propose that it is an incorrect premise to construct racial identities. EDIT: (Addition) Many of the greatest "revivalists" and thinkers of Hinduism (although the term Hinduism is very broad- i use it here in the conventional sense) have come from South India (South India- again in conventional sense). Three of the most well known scholars/thinkers were Shankaracharya, Ramanuja and Madhavacharya. Epics such as the Ramayana have been re-interpreted and re-told in South Indian Languages such as Kamban's version of Ramayana. Also, Shaivism and other forms of Hinduism has had rich literary inputs from all languages. To see literature check this. The other (primary) languages in south India are Kannada, Malayalam, and Telugu. A search will throw up many results, but it is too vast to cover in an SE answer. 

It is clear from these that the techniques were not perfected yet- even if we today believe that a base 60 math was a viable system. 

"Living Standards" require certain or standards. It is therefore very difficult to come to empirical conclusions. On what basis do we judge living standards? However, if we consider and , as well as in absolute terms, that is taking some particular year as a base (100) then a few studies show that while UK's Per capita GDP increased steadily from 1000 C.E., India's did not rise that much at all. By 1500 C.E. India was already lagging behind. This study is due to Angus Maddison. See this. Another paper which provides several other indicators, also studies the period from 1600 C.E finds a steady decline in per capita GDP while UK's per capita increases steadily in the same period. See page 22, tables 12 and 13. For wages, see page 16, table 3. This paper also mentions several other source material as reference. Another source which which studies economic history is "World Economic Historical Statistics" by Carlos Sabillon. This book details/charts the changes in GDP and sector-wise contributions (Manufacturing, Agriculture) from 16th century to the 1990s for all regions of the world. 

Coming from the northern half of India, I assumed that Hindus were all cremated. In the southern half of the country, I was surprised to find many Hindu burial grounds. Subsequent searches showed many such burial grounds exist even in Northern India, but the usual explanation was that these were for the "low castes". Other explanations such as "Shavaites bury the dead" and "Vaishnavs cremate" are also available on the net. However, I cannot seem to find the law or instruction or the first manual that says how to treat the dead body in any document. Seen this and this and this and also on burial but none of them quote any source or reference of these laws. A clarification: I'm not looking for current manuals such as the "Panjika" which may tell you what to do after someone's death, but the source of the law from ancient texts. 

It also provided a chance to the US to open up to China, when they increasingly considered the Soviets to be the greater threat. 

Taking into account the the time taken for 1 day's travel, caravanserais were strategically located on the trade routes at distances of 25 to 40km from each other. The topography, of course, affected the distance of the caravanserais. The caravanserais not only sheltered caravans, but also served as military stations. And lastly, there was also Insurance. 

Chinese travelers’ accounts show, with Harsha in the early 7th century, a king could again be characterized as Buddhist, though he issued coins depicting Shiva as well as the Buddha. Many such factors indicate that the early, classical age of India was very much Buddhist dominated. According to the Jatakas, Indian merchants went to Babylon, which was known as Baveru, to southeast Asia, and to Sri Lanka. Traders along the Silk Road were Buddhist too, carrying the religion well into China, Middle East and Central Asia. 

You are referring to 2 Mongolias. The State of Mongolia was formerly called the Mongolian People's Republic. Formerly a part of China, it proclaimed independence with the support of Russia. On March 13th 1921 a Provisional People's Government was established, and then on November 26th, 1924 the government proclaimed the Mongolian People's Republic. This was a Soviet satellite state. A referendum took place on October 20, 1945, when Mongolia voted for independence. 

He reproduces chunks from official records detailing how Nixon ordered a naval task force towards the subcontinent to "scare off" India from attacking West Pakistan. In subsequent years, former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, and two deputy PMs - Jagjivan Ram and Y B Chavan - were alleged to be the CIA operative active during the 1971 war. 

It is discussed in several books that the CIA had a mole in Indira Gandhi's cabinet around the time of the Liberation war for Bangladesh in 1971. There are conflicting reports about who the mole could be. In spite of several denials and claims, it does not seem apparent who the person might have been. Anuj Dhar in his book writes- 

This is from Prelude to Leadership (The Post-War diary of John F. Kennedy). See page 73 to 74. But what you quoted is mixed with this: 

Romila Thapar in "Early India" (pp 48) does say that a Hindu Temple was converted to a Muslim Mosque at Ajmer. But her context is that Religious exchange and interchange cannot be simply explained either by tolerance or bigotry. She also refers to Buddhist "chaityas" being converted to Hindu temples. Note however, there is no direct reference to the Chisti Shrine, although it is quite likely the one. What does derive, though is that there must be references elsewhere to at least some shrine being a converted Hindu temple. 

From the birth of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, both China and the United States wanted to improve their relationship. Ideological differences and mutual suspicions prevented a common understanding. So when the Sino-soviet conflict happened, it was a chance for the US to patch up.
