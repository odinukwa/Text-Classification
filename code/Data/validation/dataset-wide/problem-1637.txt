The search for "neurogenic shock circumcision" returns zero results on pubMed, which is the largest database of medical literature in English. The closest thing I could find is "American Society for Pain Management Nursing (ASPMN) Position Statement: Male Infant Circumcision Pain Management," which states:

First things first: a bruise (layman's term) is a type of hematoma (medical term), by definition.1 Rubbing a bruise is not a part of the standard protocol for treating hematomas. The standard is RICE, which stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation.2 Several sources suggest that rubbing and other forms of massage in general may actually contribute to tissue damage. See "Hepatic Hematoma after Deep Tissue Massage" in The New England Journal of Medicine, "Massive Haematoma from Digital Massage in an Anticoagulated Patient: A Case Report" in Singapore Medical Journal, and "Haematoma Testes due to Traditional Massage in a Neonate," in Tropical Doctor. 3,4,5,6 

One of the leading biblical scholars in the United States, Michael D. Coogan, dates the archeological evidence for the events described in the Old Testament at ca. 3300-1200 BCE.1 The first five books of the bible contain texts that are dated, at the outer bounds, to 922-722 BCE, this according to Richard Elliott Friedman, another prominent scholar of the old testament.2 Although these dates do not give us a definitive date for the founding of Judaism (and we can argue about what Judaism means), they provide reasonably accurate empirical evidence for ancient worship practices that constitute Judaism in its contemporary sense.3 1. See Chronology in the The Old Testament by Michael Coogan, pp. 550-7. 2. See "Introduction" in Friedman, Richard Elliott. The Bible with Sources Revealed. San Francisco: HarperOne, 2005. 3.

The claim is plausible. Let's break it down into several components: Q: Are monkeys capable of stealing wallets or learning to use vending machines? A: Certainly. There is ample video evidence of monkeys stealing wallets and using vending machines. Token-based food vending is common practice in studies of animal behavior. Q: Are simians capable of learning how to use vending machines on their own? A: Yes. See "Socially biased learning in monkeys" by Fragaszy and Visalberghi in Animal Learning & Behavior (2004) 32: 24 among similar studies. 

Yes, they are. The Indian Licence Agreement for Provision of Cellular Mobile Telephone Service states in section 42.1: 

The article refers to the northbound Zhuozhou Toll Gate at the G4 motorway just south of the Beijing city boundary. As you can see on the aerial photography from Google Maps, at this location, the G4 motorway has 8 lanes (4 in each direction): $URL$ 

The average global land temperature has indeed been relatively stable for the last 10 years or so, but I cannot explain how the journalist claims this to be true for the period 1997 to 2003/2004. Perhaps if you play enough with the smoothing algorithm and the confidence intervals, you might be able to get similar results. The numbers from the Hadley Centre are relatively consistent with other regularly published data sets, e.g. the GISS Surface Temperature Analysis from NASA. 

Yes, these ratios are actually correct. The number of Algerians charged with a criminal offence is relative to the population count 54 times higher than the number of charged Norwegians. 29,516 of roughly 4.5 million Norwegian citizens were charged with a criminal offence in 2010, while 128 Algerians faced the same faith of a population of 362. Likewise, 700 of the 1561 Vietnamese citizens living in Norway were reported unemployed, making the unemployment ratio 36 times higher than among the Norwegian citizens. Worth to notice is perhaps also, that only immigrants from three countries show a crime ratio <1: 

The calculation you're linking to assumes 20,000 hours of work during residency. According to Wikipedia's section on residency in the United States, the residency usually lasts for one year (state dependent) and the number of working hours is limited to 80 per week. That makes a maximum of 4,160 hours, which is not even close to the number used in the claim. 

Among the Trump supporters, 41% answered 'support bombing Agrabah', 9% answered 'oppose bombing Agrabah' and 51% answered 'not sure'. So, at least at a first glance, it may seem as if 41% of Trump's supporters want to bomb Agrabah. There are of course several issues with this poll. As already pointed out, none of the options really reflect the fact that Agrabah is a fictional country. There has been a lot of speculation in the comments, e.g. Ryan writes: 'I think it's worth noting that there's probably a significant number of people "In support of" bombing Agrabah because they realize it's a BS question.'. I am honestly trying to avoid speculations or subjective interpretations when answering questions here, but since Sklivvz asks for more elaboration in his comments and the only possible option to get a definitive answer to 'why did you answer X, Y or Z' would be the unfeasible contact with the respondents, here we go: If I as a respondent had known that Agrabah is a fictional country, the only reasonable answer would IMHO be to oppose bombing. Supporting the bombing is fruitless, since the bombing cannot be conducted and answering 'not sure' does also not really fit my intentions. If I had not known Agrabah, one could of course imagine reasonable opinions fitting the different options: 

I've heard the claim often myself, but it is not easy to find any backing research or statistics and I would assume that there will be great variations in the answers, depending on which country or geographic region you look at. I managed to find statistics from the last parliament election in Norway (2009), where voter's education and political preference is examined closer. The relevant data is found in the second block of table A.1, page 28 (Utdanning). The level of education has been split into three groups: 

If we follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definition of chronic fatigue syndrom, a CFS diagnosis requires the following (among other) criterion to be fulfilled: 

First of all, Google can find quite a lot of background on the dispute between Steve Lipsky and Range Resources Corp. This article is a summary of the situation, where Range Resources Corp. has been drilling for gas close to Lipsky's estate, after which Lipsky is blaming the company for ruining a well, from which he used to get his fresh water supply. It is perhaps also worth to note that Lipsky has been convicted for being 'part of a "conspiracy to defame" the company because he'd circulated a video "calculated to alarm the public into believing the water was burning."'. Assuming that the verdict was correct, Lipsky has previously distributed videos with fraudulent claims about the water from his well burning. The news article I linked to, mentions methane contamination as the reason for the burning water, which is consistent with the fact that Range has been drilling for natural gas nearby. Methane is indeed a highly inflammable gas (mixed with air, the methane content must exceed appr 5% for the mix to be inflammable) and it seriously contributes to the greenhouse effect, but except for that, it is pretty harmless with no known toxic effects (material data safety sheet). There are even relatively high levels of methane in the humane digestion tract. According to this study, the average flatus (fart) has a methane content of about 7%. Now, methane is barely soluble in water, according to Wikipedia, only 22.7mg/l. If you look closely at the video from 0:20 to 0:30, there is also no obvious proof that the water is actually burning. To me, it looks as if a gas escaping the water pipe is burning at the opening. If the water had actually been burning, why wouldn't the water jet burn further away from the pipe opening as well? So to answer your questions: Is it safe to drink water, which can be set on fire? In this case, there is no sign that the water is actually burning. If whatever burns at the pipe opening is methane gas, it is in no way harmful to drink water having been in contact with methane gas or with small amounts of methane disolved. Is it for ordinary home purposes safe to use water, which can be set on fire? Still doubting that the water is actually burning, what may be a problem is that methane is released in closed rooms through a water pipe network. Even here, small levels are uncritical, but depending on how fast methane is released and how fast the air in the room is replaced, there may of course be a risk, that explosive levels of methane are reached. 

I am somewhat surprised by the findings, but there is a lot of published research on this topic. A paper published in Science in 1976 maintains that: 

In the "Arithmetic of the Medieval Universities," an article published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Dorothy V. Schrader writes: 

I should note that in this context it is likely that the newspapers are using the word tarantula to refer to a wide range of spiders. The death reports are common enough in the early literature, however. In the words of a headline from The Philadelphia Inquirer on July 17, 1899: "Bitten by a Tarantula, Death Probably Lurked in a Bunch of Bananas." 

Based on this literature review, I would conclude that cupping research is dangerously close to being a pseudo-science. I was not able to find any studies in mainstream journals like the New England Journal of Medicine or the British Medical Journal. †Please note that this answer does not constitute medical advice.

This is not my field, but I have taken graduate-level courses on Andalusian history and the history of mathematics. From what I can tell, the claim is at best imprecise and at worst an outright misrepresentation of history. For example, in an article published by the British Society for the History of Science, "From Abacus to Algorism: Theory and Practice in Medieval Arithmetic," Gillian Evans writes that: 

You often hear a variation on the idea that plants "absorb" air pollution. For example, in a Yahoo News article on Beijing smog, the reporter writes: 

A cursory search finds no supporting (non-anecdotal) evidence for or against smoking oregano for recreational usage. A 1972 article from Human Pathology mentions oregano as a substance that can be passed off as pot to fool the buyer: 

Another paper, in the Journal of Instrumental Analysis proposes to use gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to distinguish gutter from edible oils.3 Finally, there is a the wikipedia page on gutter oil, with even more sources. References

Moreover, the same paper concludes that "in the case of mice infected with influenza virus, ion-deprivation increases the cumulative mortality rate" and "since ion depletion is a constant concomitant of modern urban life, one reasonably may speculate about comparable inimical effects on humans." A study published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology in 2009 finds ionization "to be an effective method for reduction in surface and airborne bacteria." In this study ionizers were installed inside refrigerators, and although effective the amount of reduction depended "the constructional layout and material properties of the ionizer housing, air circulation within the refrigerator and the interior volume" or the refrigerator. An earlier study in the Journal of Food Protection concludes that "high levels of negative air ions can have a significant impact on the airborne microbial load, and that most of this effect is through direct killing of the organisms." By contrast, a study done in 2007 by the School of Civil Engineering, University of Leeds suggests that "the bactericidal action attributed to negative air ions by previous researchers may have been overestimated." To summarize then, it seems that ionizers can indeed reduce the airborne bacterial load but could also be bad for humans. A reasonable piece of advice comes from the same 1976 article in Science quoted above, which recommends to "maintain air ion concentrations and ratios approximating those existing in nature" and expresses hope that "air ion levels of urban air will approach those of clean rural air."
