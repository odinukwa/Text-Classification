Life's strange, isn't it. There are a lot of words in your OP, "struggle", "confusing", "hating and loving", "battle" ... these seem pretty classically to be "the three poisons". IMO these are characteristics of how we see the world, of how we relate to it. For example, and I don't want to condemn your views but if you're asking how I live with mine, a kinder way to view a capitalist society (kinder than "puts money first and pits people against one another") is that it provides a mechanism or system for people to cooperate with each other (work with each other, trade with each other, give to each other) for their mutual benefit. Whether you hate it is a matter of how you view it. It seems to me wrong to kill yourself as a result of having, or of attaching to, "wrong views". At school I learned that people (scientists) should select their views, according to whether those views are beneficial. The battle with my own dark side and the twisted comfort of lashing out and causing more chaos and hurt for others because of my own pain. Two things. You might find that more tolerable to think of it as "a dark side" rather than "my dark side". Whatever it is -- anger, hurt, tit-for-tat -- it might be easier to view it as some phenomenon but not as "mine" nor "me". It's presumably "conditioned", so, learn to avoid the circumstances and views in which it arises? Also, on the subject of suicide, I was told that suicide causes pain to other people (and so should be avoided even with "secular" views). Also I recommend you re-read the verses in Chapter 10 of the Dhammapada. I find it's applicable as a statement about violence including self-violence. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. It feels like a nice option. I've thought about going to Mexico and getting some nambutal, going to a hotel room and ingesting it. Thoughts come and go. Maybe don't "go to Mexico", while you're feeling that way. If you just want to go to sleep though ... I'd say "go ahead" and do that, go to sleep. I think it's better to be "self-indulgent" on the topic of sleep: if I find I feel sleepy then I take a nap or go to bed for the night. I'm not sure that kind of pandering to the body is approved of in Buddhism, but I think it's necessary (or at least helpful) for my mood and mental capacity. The Dalai Lama recommends sleep, e.g. 

So may I know if it's allowed or not? It's a Buddhist practice, in some countries, to buy caged birds (or sometimes other animals, like fish), in order to liberate them (i.e. to set them free, let them go). I guess the purpose is to acquire merit, and that an idea behind it is that birds want their freedom. An "unintended consequence" (of buying birds) is that people trap birds in order to sell them. For this reason you might (or might not) want to refrain from buying birds, according to the same logic as being vegetarian (i.e. not buying meat in order to not encourage other people to kill animals): as you probably know, different schools of Buddhism hold different views on this subject. IMO birds are a special category of the topic of, more generally, pet animals. Perhaps some people would keep fish (thinking that fish don't object to being kept); or "domesticated" animals like dogs, cats, cows, chickens, horses... Buying dogs, incidentally, provides a financial incentive to breeders of dogs (i.e. it causes people to breed dogs). Some people suggest that you shouldn't buy a dog from a breeder, but instead "rescue" a dog from a shelter. When you rescue a dog, by the way, that's to keep the dog rather than to free it -- it appears that a pet dog would prefer to stay with its owner than to have to face the world alone. Apparently there's an "unintended consequence" of getting dogs from a shelter: I read recently that some shelters are rich (from the donations they receive) and so buy puppies from breeders in order to have more to rescue! A way to avoid that, if it matters, might be to rescue an older dog (not a puppy). It may be relevant to mention that animals in captivity sometimes live longer than in the wild -- they may be "safer", better fed, better cared for. And isn't it same as slavery? I don't know what goes on in the mind of a bird: I suppose they're not aware of slavery as a state-of-self, but are aware of a cage as a barrier-to-liberty. "Slavery" (as a type of human relationship) would exist in the mind of the "owner". From a human point of view, a good thing about not being a slave is that you can choose your master or boss (i.e. choose who you work for). If you don't like your current boss, you're at liberty to look for another. Dogs seem to me more able and willing to communicate than birds. Pet dogs often have an opportunity to escape, and choose not to. The "leash" is often seen as being, and used, only for the dog's safety -- to protect the dog's safety rather than to protect the owner's ownership of the dog. I'm not sure that I see a pet dog as a slave: more of a friend, partner, or family member. OTOH some dogs are kept chained or caged: and it's easier to see them as "slaves". I guess some people see a pet (dog or bird) as being like a friend or a kind of friend, or like a young child, rather than only like a slave. Having (and looking after) a bird is a responsibility, which some people would prefer to avoid or to not seek -- if it's true that possessions are a burden, that (being burdensome) may be even more true of live animals -- but maybe that (whether it's seen as a burden or a blessing) depends on the attitude of the person. 

So Atman is a word with a meaning, which other schools (not Buddhism) claimed had existence. When some schools of Buddhism were trying to describe something (i.e. 'Buddha-nature') they re-used an existing word (i.e. 'Atman') for that description. I think it's less confusing to view/use 'Atman' as an adjective instead of as a noun. For example, this says, 

One place where the word 'capacity' is used is in the translation of The Jewel Ornament Of Liberation: 

This video says that it's widespread among French and German university students, ecologists, especially left-wing, for example at political assemblies and unions. And it says that an internet search shows that it's part of the "language of signs" but that no-one knows which country it began in. The page Monks and nuns from the Thich Nhat Hanh collective, in Plum Village, France, pay our school a special visit suggest that Thich Nhat Hahn are: 

I find it strange that trying to tell someone how to see dukkha might be viewed as "helpful", but... <sigh>. FWIW some of my most enjoyable experiences of breathing are; 

A related term is Vicikitsa (which means "doubt"): this is one of the so-called "10 fetters", and is one of the first 3 fetters abandoned at the first stage of enlightenment. 

The "path with an end" is I think a reference to the 3rd noble truth, and to nirvana or arahantship as an escape from samsara. 

I don't know: that "unified reality" might be "dhamma"; i.e. if it's true that there is "a connection made with some sort of unified reality", I think that what that means is it's your seeing that the dhamma applies to everything, is an accurate description of everything. 

I read the story you quoted as a bit of a joke. Imagine if you were talking about physical pain, for example: 

... imply that the mind (e.g. it whether it harbors or doesn't harbor such thoughts) conditions (creates conditions for, is followed by) suffering or happiness -- maybe (I don't know, but I guess) DBT says something along those lines. 

The Buddha's being associated with the Dhamma begins in the Pali suttas, and perhaps it's more explicit in the later trikaya doctrine. I think it's the DharmakƒÅya that's viewed as eternal (or timeless) -- and I'm not sure it's wrong to say that, no more wrong than any of the other 6 qualities of the Dhamma. This (above) may not be an orthodox view, it's just what I understand of it at the moment. 

Spiritual development: if one person respects spiritual believes and practices, and the other holds them in total disregard, then the two people are simply incompatible. Self-discipline: if one partner is well-disciplined and the other unscrupulous then their incompatibility will become obvious and cause problems. Humanistic practices: includes dana, also caga (generous acts). Level of wisdom: i.e. samapanna, includes knowledge, skill, emotional maturity, reasoning power; doesn't mean that both should have same education and intellectual ability, but wide difference in these areas could cause incompatibility and lead to conflicts. Chapter 6 is about how to treat your partner after you marry. 

One reason given in the suttas is that he did it by request, and out of compassion. Ayacana Sutta (SN 6.1), 

I think that some of the comments under the "field and stream" article that you posted might support this diagnosis: 

I apologize: I'm gong to try to answer this even though I have not been taught zen. I read a collection of zen koans a long time ago and I thought that they were cool (i.e. like an attractive puzzle) but kind of slippery (difficult to grasp or solve, difficult to get inside a koan and understand it). In summary my answer is going to be that, maybe koans are good but they're not enough? I say that because, since the time when I read those koans, I had more experience of life, and I learned (read, thought about, tried to learn some basic vocabulary of) a bit more Buddhist dharma. So now perhaps there's a bit of Buddhist dharma in me (or "in my understanding / vocabulary / mind"). Now when I read a koan, instead of trying to get into it, instead of finding myself being able to get into it, my experience is that it gets into me. When I attempting to parse (make sense of) the koan's words, they connect with bits of dharma that are already in me. One koan is like a ball with several spikes, that sticks inside me, and each spike connects to or activates a different bit of dharma, and joins them together or, I don't know what (because I'm not practising that). 

That article says quite a lot while hardly ever mentioning karma and samsara. I think, it is better to stick to an agnostic "i don't know" attitude concerning rebirth, samsara, nirvana or rather reinterprates them than to greedily chase for liberation which is just another craving and could foster laziness, selfishness and everything which is contrary to the teachings. I mentioned it in a previous answer yesterday, but in case you didn't catch it there, I think the idea of "greedily chase for liberation which is just another craving" might be addressed in this sutta: Brahmana Sutta (SN 51.15). 

Looking at the Lists of fetters I see "conceit" and "identity view" listed separately ... and the four stages of enlightenment say that identity view will be abandoned (in the first stage) before conceit (in the fourth stage). Wikipedia article about Conceit includes, 

I think that any or all of these could be considered "views" or "self-views" (and/or possibly conceits). If views like this are a reason why you're alcoholic (remain attached to alcohol), then Buddhist doctrine such as, 

But i don't see this any characters in todays humans Perhaps you should, it would be better if you did, see compassion towards others in other people? There's a (non-Buddhist) saying that might be relevant: "The only way to have a friend is to be one." Anyway, I wanted to quote from the Punna sutta:
