Michael Dorfman's comment on Stoicfury's answer is important, indeed for me it is the crux of the question, so I thought I'd expand on it. 'Simplicity', when applied to a set of rules, is an inherently meaningless concept. One might ask for example which is simpler out of the integers and a general ring- the former requires more axioms than the latter, but arises more naturally than the class of all rings: to say one is simpler, more likely a priori, would be wrong. Occam's Razor works (at least, can be seen to work) because it is a statement in conditional probability: each additional entity X we posit to be at work adds another factor P(XÂ¦ All the other entities posited so far) to our probability, each of which must be less than or equal 1. From another point of view, an additional entity occurs in a subset of instances, with lower of equal probability (by the monotonicity of probability measure [if A is a subset of B, P(A) < or= P(B)]). Our problem comes from the fact that purely abstract entities cannot be ostensively defined- 'twoness' for example is a property that varies in its sense (if I break something in half, is that one or two?) and so their instances are not well-defined, making subsethood (and hence a priori relative likelihood) an impossibility. We can rescue some semblance of a notion of likelihood, though, by positing the existence of entities which can be placed in ostensive correspondence with our abstractions: concrete mechanisms, for example, that produce the fibonacci sequence (or, more mundane, collections of objects that combine like the natural numbers under addition). And although it is somewhat surprising that such entities should exist, they most certainly seem to. The OP cites a truncated fibonacci sequence and asks 'is the next likely to be fibonacci?'-naturally this depends on what our sequence is of (dividing cells? number of hats by size?) and the complexity of the mechanism he could propose by which fibonaccis should be produced. 

Utilitarianism is self evidently difficult to bring to bear on two person hypotheticals such as this: weighing one person's happiness against that of another is, especially without context, rather hard. Standard approaches to dispensing with such problems fall into two broad categories. Deontological rules of thumb Many utilitarian philosophers, such as Mill in Utilitarianism, use utilitarianism as a basis for 'rules of thumb'as a way to avoid such difficulties (see Wikipedia's Rule Utilitarianism page). A variation of the so called golden rule of ethics is (quite) easily derivable in these terms and dispenses with the preference of the prurient neighbour as non-reciprocal or unsustainable by the whole of society. Specific analysis of the situation If we looked closely enough at the situation, we can argue that the situation in which the neighbour's increase in happiness at the lady being a shut-in outweighs her increase in happiness at being able to escape is impossible. References to the heirarchy of needs can provide a general basis for rebuttal, but the existence of other solutions (perhaps the neighbour could move, if it is so great an issue!) is also an option. Nonetheless... There remains the theoretical possibility that the nosy neighbour is a utility monster of some kind, and in spite of appeals of the latter kind ('Surely noone is actually a utility monster!'), the possibility is very difficult to dismiss a priori and such thought experiments can remain a problem for utilitarianism as a foundation for meta-ethics. 

Your claim as to the impossibility of your 'physical affecting physical' definition of epiphenomalism is a direct consequence of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. But the same cannot, I think, be said for certain when the epiphenomenon is allowed to be non-physical (See my comments on stoicfury's answer). Edit: The copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics states that the effective uncertainty of observables is entirely a consequence of our inability to measure such observables without altering the state of the system. If we assume that particles obey the laws of quantum mechanics (as your question must do, if it is to get an answer) then this uncertainty is endemic- and thus so (if we also accept the copenhagen interpretation) must be the problem of measurement without alteration. If a quantum mechanical system is affected by another, then the former measures the latter in some way and so alters it. 

In a nutshell: One may regard it as unfortunate that the absolutes of mathematics are conditional. It is, however, more satisfying to rejoice that the conditionals of mathematics are absolute! 

I read Pinker's How the Mind Works a few years back, and a thought occurred to me that I couldn't find in the two serious reviews (Fodor and somebody else, I forget)I dredged up afterwards. 

As Michael Dorfman has already suggested in his citation of Derrida- such shenanigans can be so much entrails and tea leaves- pick the interpretation that best matches your mark's probable fate. I like to read it by regarding the nexus of 'style' as a word in the thrownness of Dasein at the behest of das Mann. It is not inconceivable that like many existentialists at the time, Camus may have been influenced by Heideggerian thought, and the language, tone and message of the quote sits well couched thus. 

Nietsche, as others before and after him (its roots, I am told, are in the West Asian tradition) , espoused the idea of an ever repeating clockwork universe, in which all lives are led over and over; each time identically. In choosing this view, one is compelled to a love of Fate, to -in the language of Zarathustra- choose one's 'downgoing', and indeed much of 'Thus Spoke...' follows from it as a premise (although it is not mentioned until the closing chapters). Nietsche, not fool enough to believe it could be proved to be reality, presented it (out of Zarathustra's voice) as a thought experiment: 

'The passions' are only one 'source of ought' (to say: 'motivation')- certainly if we wish to achieve something (presumably at the behest of the passions) then there are more efficient ways of doing so than others- reason would then certainly say (in obeisance to his masters the passions) that one ought to plump for ways among the most efficient. But there is, at least theoretically, more than one way to skin a deontological cat, G.E. Moore, for example, actually used an argument expanding on the impossibility of deriving an "ought" from an "is" to conclude that morality must be another innate driving force separate from both reason and the passions. My personal favourite approach is that of Hare, who argued that 'ought' is really just part of a very human language game, in which we make 'universal prescriptions' about people's behaviour. For a thoroughly accessible introduction to these and other (potential, arguable) circumnavigations of Hume's guillotine- check out Peter Singer's Introduction to Ethics essay. 

You are conflating metaphysical and epistemic necessity. You can either pick your access relations so that possibility is determined by what we know to be true in the actual world (ie. Possibility= epistemic possibility). In which case your argument is correct, and the paradox disappears, since, given that we know someone shot JFK, we only have access to worlds in which he was shot, so this is necessarily true. Or we can go with mere metaphysical necessity, so that we have access to any and all worlds that are metaphysically possible, in which case your paradox seems to follow. BUT, in this system, our statements of implicature are statements of metaphysical implication, which demands your premise (id) be interpreted as a metaphysical truth, which makes it false. In this case, we can still talk about JFK's shooter using @Koeng's trick in the comments above, which does indeed make a metaphysically correct premise. Or we can make our access relations logical, or physical, or whatever you fancy. Your error here is a common one: "Modal Logic" is not, like first order predicate calculus, a single logic, but a family of logical theories- a template that can encompass the various notions of necessity, various domains of discourse, that we consider important.
