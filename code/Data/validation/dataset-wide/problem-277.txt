You have a few choices for floating plants. One is the gas balloon model that you mentioned. It would likely be just a translucent balloon floating in the sky. I think that it would be translucent because the plant would not want to devote enough weight to structure to make it opaque. Also, that means the chlorophyll could run on all sides since some light would leak through to hit the opposite side. The sides do not have to be strong since internal pressure could be similar to outside pressure. Another option would be a hot air balloon. The top is clear and the bottom of the inside is very dark with chlorophyll (or the equivalent). Since not all of the light is converted into chemical energy, the rest is absorbed and converted into heat. This heat would expand the air inside creating lift. Such plants would likely sink at night. The final option is to go small. The plants float like dust floats. The heavier the atmosphere the bigger the plants can be and the flatter they are the better they float. In this case, the plants could be like plankton in the ocean. You might posit wind/rain/turbulence conditions that would cause the plants to clump and fall out of the sky. This might be when the plants mate. 

Create a hoop with Purify Food and Drink on it and use it to recycle the water. Then you just have to figure out how to transport the water uphill to holding tanks. You can do that through siphoning (32 feet at a time) or through some animated water pump. Another possibility is set up Decanters of Endless Water on the high ground and a Sphere of Annihilation at the low point. If you combine the two methods, (some Decanters to make up for water loss) you have a pretty good system. 

Shadow1024 is pretty on point. The government would be slow to believe that anything is happening but different portions of the huge bureaucratic beast that is the government would figure it out faster than others. The official policy would likely be be to deny it publicly while trying to get ahead of the situation. Getting ahead of the situation involves controlling it by recruiting/eliminating/incarcerating those with abilities in secret. Different branches of the government may have different strategies and may or may not know that other branches also know about the supernaturals. Once things hit the press, it all depends on what story hits the press. The story of a person flying into a burning building and rescuing people will cause a different reaction than a story about a person using powers to set fire to a building with people in it. I picked this examples because they both may have happened in the same incident. It just depends on what got caught on camera. The government's reaction will be what makes the population happy. 

It really depends on your area. Here in the US, you will have an easier time in the East than the West. Most of the poisonous snakes in the West are vipers that have muscle and blood attacking poisons. What you want are neurotoxins like the cottonmouth and coral snake have. Those are much more common in the East (coral snakes can be found as far west as southern Arizona). Vipers' venom will kill you just as dead but it won't be as fast as you are looking for. In the West, you may have some luck with scorpions but they aren't so common that I'd rely on them. Also, snakes can be kept alive and fed to produce more poison. I'm not as familiar with other places except that you are pretty much S.O.L. in Hawaii due to their lack of poisonous land creatures. If you are in Australia, however, you are in luck. Just look out your door and you'll see something toxic. Edited to correct mamba/coral snake mixup that @jamesqf pointed out in the comments. 

The main difference is that it will be advantageous to pass under your opponent instead of over them since a bow can shoot upward. While the distance is vastly reduced, it would be nice to get free shots while your opponent's ride is blocking their return fire. Of course, if their ride can dive down and rip you out of your saddle, it is a bit of a risky maneuver. [Edit: for clarity] My general assumption is that any mount big enough to have a distinct advantage in a melee engagement is too slow and unmaneuverable to catch the smaller opponent. 

If they can be farmed and are a more efficient form of meat than other animals (like the grass is too tough and to invasive for cows but megas can eat it) then their populations will increase as we assure their survival. If they are more useful for transportation they will be kept and bred. If the mega fauna isn't useful, and we can't eat it, then it's only hope is to not be a problem. If it doesn't eat humans or their crops and, for some reason, they don't trample our crops, people won't take the time to wipe them out. That doesn't mean that we won't wipe them out, just that there's a chance that we won't. 

If you are proposing for the purpose of a story that the courts have overturned the part of the treaty that says: 

You get power from speed and mass. If you decrease the speed, you have to increase the mass. This is OK if you are targeting a satellite or other non moving object. In fact the increased mass may mitigate countermeasures since it will take more force to knock the weapon off course. However, if the target can maneuver and can see the weapon (or just knows it is in danger and is moving randomly), you will likely not hit it. A slow moving massive object cannot be used in a strong gravity well unless the target is at the bottom of the gravity well. Shooting a slow & heavy from a bow on Earth will result in an arrow hitting the ground not far from you. However, dropping a crowbar from orbit onto a building on the Earth will be quite effective. 

Wars will become much more common. One Duke can have his little tiff with another at a moment's notice and not have to worry about losing all of his farmers or his ability to defend against future attacks. 

The minimum? About ten. If they can research compounds and alloys that cannot be made in a gravity well, it might be possible to make your money back with just the research results. Energy: harvesting He3 on the Moon would take a couple hundred people. Building large solar arrays to microwave the energy back to Earth would take up to 1000 (probably less) to build and position the arrays. Manufacturing: Making things that cannot be made in a gravity well like alloys of compounds with very different specific densities, foam steel, flawless crystals: Unknown, it depends on how fragile and heavy the items are. If it not fragile at all, put it in a pod with a heat shield and aim for some place safe. If it is slightly fragile, put a parachute on it. If it is really delicate, you need something that can land gently; that might be expensive enough that you would want to send it back into space instead of build one use vehicles. Another question is: how many people do you need to get into space before they say, "No." 

There was a big discussion on the Aurora forum a few years ago about realistic space combat. Here are some takeaways from that: Except for knife fighting ranges you need seeking weapons (missiles). The reason is that detection ranges are very long due to the limitations of stealth in space. The reason is that you cannot target the ship. Light speed communication and detection means that you are seeing where the ship was. Also your weapon takes time to arrive. Lasers travel at c. Most anything else travels significantly slower. You have to target the probability bubble of where that ship might be when your beam/projectile/etc. arrives. The probability bubble gets bigger with the combination of acceleration available to the ship and the combined travel time of the detection radiation and the weapon's travel speed. You can shrink the probability bubble two ways: better processing power to rule out unlikely outcomes faster than the bubble grows due to the time of calculating that and giving up damage to attack an area. Missiles shrink that bubble by course correcting as they travel. Missiles can be better than fighters because they can apply more acceleration to "dodging" (making their probability bubble bigger) on approach since humans tend to squish if you get too energetic. Also, missiles don't mind going on a one way mission. Some are actually eager for it: "Bomb #2, get back in your bay." That leads to a doctrine of missile vs anti-missile weapons with variations. Anti-missiles can be either small missiles or direct fire weapons. So the strategies are:
