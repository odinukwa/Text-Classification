Sometimes there is no discernible reason why one person was laid off and another was kept. Many years ago I worked for a rather large company which laid off a few hundred employees. We were told about 2 months before it happened that it was coming. They did the layoffs in stages on a friday. Over the course of a few hours you either got an email from HR telling you to see your manager or you didn't. It was really odd sitting there wondering if I was next. A little background: I was a contractor at the end of the 90 day "trial" period. During that 3 months I had contributed about 4 hours worth of actual work and sat on my hands the rest of the time. Yes I asked my boss every single day for something and every day he told me there was no work to be performed. So I knew that I was going to be walked out. I wasn't. Not only was I not terminated but the following Monday I was offered a full time position making more than I was as a contractor. It was truly a twilight zone moment. The layoffs honestly appeared to be completely random because I knew the people I saw gather their stuff and leave actually had work to do. Either they were in the middle of projects or their stuff was finishing up QA and near deployment. My point is, sometimes there is no explanation. Or at least, there isn't one that will ever be given to you. The best you can do is realize that it was completely out of your hands and be at peace with that. Take a day or two to do something fun then begin the job search ready to go. 

Generally I'd say client name followed by a bullet list of the apps with a very short description (single sentence) of what you did on that app. 

First, there is no such thing as anonymity. The more information you divulge in a review the easier it is to identify the exact person who posted it. Second, you have to weigh the consequences of your speech. Sure, you can write whatever you want in a review but there may be negative consequences for doing so. Obviously you are now running into some of those consequences. I'm not going to tell you to change or remove your review as that's a personal decision. Rather I'm just going to say that you should think about this before posting too much information if you decide to do it again in the future. You've now burned a bridge. Although you need to list that employment on your resume, I wouldn't try to use them as a reference. Depending on what country you are in that employer may not even be contacted with regards to your work history. And even if they are, hopefully only HR will be contacted and not the owner that way this specific problem is "forgotten" about. Which leads to the next thing - it's incredibly unlikely that a future employer will question you about things that pop up during their due diligence on you. Which means it's unlikely you'll have an opportunity to explain yourself. My advice is simply to not worry about it until it comes up. If it does then honestly answer their questions. 

Then rather than a bunch of random internet people guessing you'll have an actionable answer to work from. 

As soon as an employee approaches you on their "issue" go with: You, "Is this a problem with your manager?" Them, "No." You, "Well, you should know that I have full trust in Sally or she wouldn't be a manager. If you really want to go around her then I'll tell you right now that the answer is no. Sally might have a different perspective so I suggest you start there." Essentially - shut them down immediately. If it persists then put them on an improvement plan while carefully spelling out the behavior. Now, at the same time you need to make sure that you aren't directly assigning those people tasks. That's what your managers are for. If you are bypassing your managers, then your employees will do the same. 

Sounds like he is teaching the grasshopper here. Perhaps grasshopper should go install two VMs instead of trying to waste his time. This part should be trivial for anyone claiming to be a programmer. If for some reason "other" doesn't know how to install a VM then I'd suggest google may be a more appropriate venue for further questions. Assuming grasshopper does install the requirements then grasshopper should feel free to approach him for further enlightenment. 

Yes and no. First off, you should remember that everyone can be replaced. Granted some people are just a little more painful to replace than others, but companies survive all the time after the loss of key people. Also, it's considered pretty bad form to point out the difficulties of finding a replacement when it should be patently obvious. Second, asking for more money while negotiating a contract extension doesn't really require a reason. Just the fact that you want more money is enough to ask for it, and if you feel you can make a higher amount elsewhere then you should be asking for it. The real question they need to ask themselves is whether the amount you now want crosses a threshold in which it is less costly/painful to just replace you and/or the system. 

You need to contact your boss and work this out. His lack of response to the email could mean one of several things. Such as: 

There are MANY reasons why people may be terminated from a job. There are equally varied reasons that might be "rumored" about such a situation. Often those don't necessarily mix and, at least in the US, most employers wouldn't comment on the reason an employee is no longer with them anyway. (link) Further there's usually far more to a story than is generally talked about around the water cooler. A while back, I very nearly terminated an employee based upon information provided by two others. The details aren't germane. Fortunately the employee was out sick the day I planned on taking action. This gave me an extra day to ponder the situation and reach out to others in the affected group because something just sounded a little off. What I found out made me stop and go back to the original reporters. Ultimately the story provided had been made up by one of them and told to the other, who not only completely believed it but reported it as if they had first hand knowledge. The situation was such that if it had been true then immediate dismissal was the only responsible course. Had I fired this person I would have been doing the wrong thing. When hiring people I feel you should allow some latitude for the past. In other words, the reasons surrounding their departure from a job may not be a reflection of their character; it might not even be wholly true. Regardless being dismissed can lead to a fair amount of introspection which can lead to a positive change. Now if this person was "terminally" lazy - meaning they've bounced from job to job with the same issue - then it would be absolutely apparent by their work history. Those types tend not to last long at many companies; this is one of the reasons that numerous short term employments are usually a big red flag during the hiring process. Which the boss should have noticed and considered. Point is, don't worry about it. You didn't hire them, someone else did. Presumably you aren't in charge of their continued employment, someone else is. Which means it's up to the actual responsible party here to ensure their decision was a valid one and to take action if it turns out to be incorrect. By throwing your 2 cents in, all you would do is possibly color the boss' perception by spreading rumor and, potentially, making a career limiting move (CLM) if you turn out to be completely wrong. Or, worse, opening yourself up to potential legal trouble if the other employee found out what you had said and was willing to go to court over it. 

There is no "automatic" removal of any criminal records (misdemeanor or otherwise). You can attempt to have it expunged but there are a lot of factors that go into this and you still might not be able to do that. If it's been this long your best bet is to hire a legal representative for two reasons. The first is to educate you on your current situation, rather than just listening to what some random people said. The second would be to attempt to expunge your record. If you can get your record expunged then you'll be good to go. 

What are you actually after here? In other words are you seeking permission to not go to college? If so, that's a really Bad Idea(tm). Are you trying to justify to others that you don't need a degree? You could just go start your own company and set your own rules on who you want to hire. The simple answer is that you can certainly you can get a job without a degree. However that's not the question you should be asking because it's unimportant. The real question is "How much harder is it going to be to get a job without a college degree?" To answer that all you need to do is search the job boards (monster, career builder, etc). Look at how many positions are open and what the requirements are for them. I think you'll pretty quickly come to the conclusion that perhaps completing your college education is a Good Idea(tm). Now if you are writing a paper on this, then you shouldn't depend on a bunch of random internet people to tell you what's what. Instead go to the source - those job boards I mentioned. Sift through the posted openings and record what you see. 

Simply put not having a degree, any degree really, closed a LOT of doors to me. Larger companies demand that you have some kind of degree, even if it's in Underwater Basket Weaving just to get an interview unless you happen to know people. This basically means you are going to have to up your social skills and keep good contacts. Funny story - a friend of mine got a job as a DBA. They had no previous computer experience but they did have a degree in English Lit. The company just needed to fill a spot and a degree was required.. That said, there are numerous companies that normally don't care. Startups, small businesses, etc. These are more likely to grant an interview based on your past work than to use a degree to filter people out.... unless the industry you are in is has a plethora of candidates. Which is the real kicker. Professions can go through spurts where there are not enough "qualified" people. In those cases it's far easier to get in somewhere without that piece of paper. However they tend to pay very well and, as such, will attract more and more talent. Meaning at some point market saturation is reached and companies then move from hiring anyone they can to being able to filter out candidates because of various things like no degree, the font used on the resume is "awful", they wore the wrong tie to the interview or whatever. Speaking of which - @JoelEtherton is absolutely right - gone are the days that you can get a decent job in IT without a degree. My point is, if possible, go back to school now. Lots of people work their way through college; I suspect you just need to set it as the priority. It may seem like a good idea to do your own thing now and not be saddled by having to attend classes. The reality is, if you get the degree now you'll have a MUCH easier time later forging your own path instead of having so many doors closed that you'll hit a hard ceiling. 

A big part of an interview is a test to determine your suitability for the job. If you don't have those skills, then that's not the job for you. If you acquire the skills only so that you can succeed in the interview, then you aren't going to like the job and your quality of life will suffer. Which leads to the final answer: Figure out what your title should be and locate that line of work, everyone will be happier as a result. 

So, rather than dwell on an unwritten broken promise, use this as a learning experience. If one of the founders ever makes a statement or promise for a future payment - whether in cash, shares or whatever - then make sure it's written down. That way everyone is perfectly clear about it. 

The only people I'm aware of that would think negatively about this are ones that wouldn't want you to advance in your career. 

Drug testing is a normal requirement for being employed in the USA. Not sure about other countries. I'd hazard a guess that it's so common that most companies don't even consider that it needs to be stated. I'd say it's right up there with background checks and NDAs. Sure, it's poor communication, but, depending on where you live and what you do, you should expect to have to pass a test. 

This is demonstrably false. They were looking for someone to maintain the website when they found you. They'll be able to find someone else. 

Two months is a very long time for anything other than a C level position - and for those you'd know exactly what was going on. If it were me, I'd just be upfront and tell them something along the lines of: 

People leave jobs all the time for various reasons. At the end of the day you likely don't have all the facts as to why Joe didn't receive his bonus. The fact that your manager appears to already be aware of the situation could mean anything from: 

I don't make these questions up on the fly, the potential answers are considered ahead of time and fit a go/no go pattern. If a question doesn't fit that then it's not relevant. I also ask every candidate the same ones unless I'm 100% convinced I'm not hiring them at which point I'll stop the interview. If for some reason you still insist on sending home a test - make sure that the skills required to successfully complete that test in a reasonable amount of time are actually skills you care about. I had one company give me a take home test that involved writing a custom cryptographic service provider. I completed the test because it was somewhat interesting; they hired me. At no point in my time there did I do anything even remotely related to security, cryptography or even math based beyond adding a few numbers. I wonder how many people they drove off with that test?
