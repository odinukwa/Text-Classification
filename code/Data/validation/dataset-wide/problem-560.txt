Even for a recovery week's endurance workout, my hip flexors surprisingly lasted a little more than enough for the workout. Maybe those muscles were my weakest links. 

Biking to work is good exercise. It can make it easier to meet our exercise needs. When commuting by bike, what heart rate or power zones do people usually use? What's a recommended target? Should we try to get to work as fast as possible or at a more relaxed pace? Do the commuters decide it based on feel? Which days should we do sprinting? Should we have similar schedules every week? An example of a schedule with the zones can be helpful. Let's say you work full time and you want to break the plateau. You want the kind of fitness improvements that make you bike to work faster and improve race times. Update Dec 20 Possible fitness goals: Faster commuting times, faster cruising speeds, 30 km/h feels easy, faster sprints to decrease missing green lights, being able to outrun wolves and bears. Getting to work faster on a bike means less need for driving to work or e-bikes! If intervals are done, does that mean the next day must be zone 1 to be fully recovered to train hard enough for your next interval session? Is the fat burning zone good enough? 

When biking to work, my routes have have stop signs, stop lights, and other interruptions every few blocks or so. My understanding is that if I reach my power at target heart rate soon after stopping so that I still save glycogen, my commutes would be faster. I'm commuting five days a week. How effective is it really in practice? How much would I expect my average speed to increase? Update with examples. After stopping at stop signs, I plan to accelerate by keeping my power around 150W depending on my fitness. After stopping at traffic lights, I plan to gradually raise my power to 150W because my heart rate would drop. In both cases, my heart rate shouldn't exceed 180-age. With power, I know that I'm not overshooting it. Update: Sample morning race to work ride in response to a comment. 

I had a similar long-range trip. I was a member of a local bike group and asked them if they, as a part of our membership, owned and lent bike luggage to members. They said they didn't have any but that it was a good idea. Maybe other bike clubs around your town might have luggage that you could rent. You might want to try bike shops and see if they have any shipping boxes. I get boxes from my LBS to ship eBay parts. Have you explored shipping it to yourself or to your hotel or a friend? There is something scary about shipping a super expensive bike in a soft bag. My advice would be not to do it. I don't think bubble wrap would help. I imagine a suit case sitting on spokes and it makes me cringe. 

I like the find-a-brand-you-like-and-stick-with-that idea. If the store let you try them on then they let someone else try them on, too. Remember, chamois' are not padding. They are for moisture management. A proper saddle and fit is for comfort. I have several brands of bibs and I only use one. My riding buddies are the same way but with their own brand. Hopefully, you won't find that your brand is the expensive one. I like Castelli. I am also moving towards a thinner chamois. I have had issues with all the added bulk in my crotch and a thinner chamois fits better. I have heard others say the same thing. 

Sometimes when I set out on a ride I will get the absolute worst foot pain. It is like a cramp in my arches on both feet. I am wondering where exactly the center of the pedal should fall in relation to my foot. 

I've used a cable crimp. It looked terrible but it prevent the cable from unravelling before I got to the bike shop to discover that a bike shop will usually give you those end caps if you buy something else from the store. The shops have them in the thousands and they probably paid about $3 for them. 

During FTP tests, I felt that I could test higher for the interval with a cadence that's almost 10 RPM lower. See VO2 Max 2 and VO2 Max 3. 

By training close to the MAF heart rate but still below it, you need less training time to get the same TSS compared to zone 1. For example, doubling the power output means you need one fourth the duration. Why do professional cyclists still prefer lots of zone 1 training when recovery rides don't need to be long? In polarized training, there's lots of zone 1 training. MAF heart rate Subtract your age from 180 to get the heart rate. Train between that heart rate and 10 beats below. The closer to the calculated heart rate, the quicker the aerobic base will be developed $URL$ 

After installing an 11-34 cassette, it makes a grinding noise even though the B screw is all the way in. The grinding sound happens only when using the largest gear. Does the grinding sound mean that one of the jockey wheels is being damaged? I use it only on steep hills which means most of the time I won't hear it. Once my fitness improves, I plan to switch it to a smaller one. 

Is it possible that my legs were heavy, making lower cadence even more efficient? My thigh's circumference is 20" and my shin's circumference is 14.5". My height is 5 feet 7. Is it better to do an FTP test with the ideal cadence or the most efficient cadence (the one that allows you to produce the most power)? For my workouts, should I select the cadence that works best for me regardless of their recommendations? Is it likely that my FTP was too low for a high cadence? 

Amber bike lights can improve daytime visibility. This makes sense because white light looks similar to sunlight and amber light stands out more clearly. Being seen sooner means that drivers have more time to react. Possible situations that benefit from improved visibility include users changing lanes, traffic circles, users turning, drivers opening their doors, users waiting at cross streets, and oncoming users passing. Also, amber may be easier on our eyes which can improve safety even more. The question is whether it's legal to use them in BC? Does the BC Motor Vehicle Act say anything about it? If it's not legal, then a possible alternative might be to avoid strobe patterns. Dinotte sells amber bike headlights. $URL$ Video of a Dinotte amber light being used: 

If they are steady on their feet and tall enough than a balance bike is fine. The advantage of a balance bike is it develops balance first as small children don't necessarily have the strength or co-ordination to ride a pedal bike to begin with. We found the wooden balance bikes to be inherently bigger - so for our child we went with the much smaller dimensions the aluminium balance bikes. 

At the beginning of the climb - approaching the climb too fast could build up lactate faster than your muscles can clear it down. But your blood vessels dilate to increase blood supply to and from the muscles during the harder work - it could be the effect you are seeing later on in the climb. My understanding of the difference between fast twitch and slow twitch muscle fibre... Fast twitch are great for bursts of speed and sprints but build lactate fast. Slow twitch are better adapted to endurance & the steady grind. Slow twitch fibre also has a better blood supply which makes them great for clearing down of lactate build-up. So, ease into a climb. Find your own steady pace and rhythm. Alternate riding position from in to out of saddle to recruit different muscle groups in the legs. 

Some training is always better than no training. It depends how fast you would like to ride the distance. Given you say there are only four weeks before you attempt the distance - and traditional training for an event would also allow 1 week prior to the event for tapering - and one weekend to attempt a distance close to the target distance ~200km. I imagine - that leaves little time for the building of endurance. Typically endurance takes longer to build and on a bike this is often done as base mileage over the winter period. Otherwise known as long, steady miles. As for whether your target is achievable - if you are fit, healthy & motivated - for sure it is. It also depends how hard you want to ride it and how challenging the terrain is. 

I up voted John P's answer. In addition I would split trafic and get a the front of the outer most lane. I would make eye contact with the driver of the car behind me, too. It'll take seconds to get across that intersection and in CA you can split lanes to get in front. 

I have left all of my navigation needs to my iPhone5. I like the 'one-device' scenario. For my longer distance stuff I am starting to get into cue sheets. I think mapmyride.com has them available when you make a map. Cue sheets have distance and name of next turn but also how long until the turn. My iPhone does all of that so I don't know how much you want to fiddle with on the bike ride. A mounted smart phone with scrolling cue sheets is easier to read than a map. 

I never carry anything special on Centuries. I carry water and Clif bars but I carry that stuff anyway. The one thing I do differently is eat and drink more. It sounds like you have plenty of stops at good intervals. Make sure to eat a lot at each one of those whether you're hungry or not. I wouldn't take any clothes. You'll be fine. We wear clothes all day and we're fine. I certainly wouldn't take anything that I haven't been training with previously. Don't run a race with new shoes. Or whatever the bike equivalent is. This is me. If I were in this ride and there was help and food stations set up, I wouldn't take any of my own. I wouldn't want the encumbermant of self-help products. Plus, it would be pretty cool to go on a long ride without that stuff. Let the volunteers do what they do. Let them feed you, let them fix your tires, let them carry out the trash. They want to do it. You hardly never get help on the road so take advantage of it. 

That looks like the quick release mechanism used when removing the tyre to open the caliper a little wider. It looks broken? - it should be tucked under in line with the pull of the cable. Since it isn't the cable is actually pulling the release open as you brake. You might be able to temporarily remedy it by leaving it in the open position and pulling the cable tighter. You would however lose the use of the quick release. Probably not a great idea to run it like this - since the cable will be pulling on the fixing nut at a strange angle. Best replace with a new caliper. 

Creaking when only in the saddle - I would check the saddle? A drop of oil into the where the saddle rails fix to the seat can alleviate. But if you are sure it is not this - then perhaps try isolating the noise by using the bike on a static trainer and pedalling. If you remove the chain from engaging with the chainset - it would isolate the noise to the chainset / BB only. 

The other option available to the OP is to buy a helicoil kit to fix the damaged threads or switch to a square taper BB to which there are special BBs available to run on a damaged thread. 

Are riding a rolling terrain. No notable climbs. A few short climbs lasting no more than a couple of minutes maximum - but otherwise a flat to undulating terrain. Both riders having the exact same power-to-weight. And apply their power in equal measure ie. same. 

When disc brakes first appeared - a lot of mountain bikes ran with a single disc brake (mechanical) at the front and a vee brake at the rear. Whilst not ideal in terms of rear braking power or aesthetics - it's a perfectly viable option and might even make the task of fitting panniers to the rear of a bike easier.
