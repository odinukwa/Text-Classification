First let's go over the appeal process. It is basically the same for any appeal in any situation. After the play is over the pitcher will engage the mound/rubber. Then step off and then throw to the base where the infraction occurred. There is no need to tell an umpire what you are appealing. They would understand that this is an appeal and make their decision. For instance if the runner missed first base and the pitcher stepped off and threw to third base the umpire would signal a "safe" sign. The pitcher may appeal to every base after the play is over. When is the play over? This is a judgement call by the umpire but basically the rulebook states when a player has officially retreated from the play. Meaning the player has begun to go to the dugout or is in the dugout or "quit" the play. Note that this is not when the player hits homeplate or crosses home. For instance a player could round the bases, cross home, run another 10 feet and a team could yell, "Go back and hit first!" The player then would have the opportunity to hit home, then third, then second, then first, then second, then third and home again to complete their homerun. It is crucial for the defensive team to not let on that they will appeal until the play is over and why you will notice that teams are very quiet/sneaky when they feel like something is missed. The rulebook in my opinion gives the offensive player too much of a chance to correct their mistake. The rule is that no run shall count with two outs if a player misses a bag and is out on appeal. Read reference from the book: 

The answer is no. A guard cannot take the snap directly from the center. Anyone not on the line of scrimmage can take a snap - rules of football. A guard is a position next to the center on the line of scrimmage so the answer is - No. A guard however can receive a handoff (not a snap) from anyone including the quarterback. The guard can also pick the ball up off of the ground if the center chooses to leave it there (many trick play variations here). 

What we noticed is that players got more sprained ankles if they were new to wearing lows. Not a lot more but maybe a 20% increase. But during the first three years we had no more than 2 high ankle sprains a year. Down from 10-15 in years before. Given that a sprained ankle would keep a kid out of practice for 2-3 days and a high ankle sprain from 2 weeks to the whole season, we were extremely happy with the results. The only issue we had was, what to do with our bigs. The lineman in football were iffy with going low and same for centers. A few refused. The rest did mids. I can say this. We unequivocally had no issues with high ankle sprains with players in lows and no other ankle wraps. Your ankle will generally sprain at the lowest spot available. 

This is actually a great question. Runners moving in foul territory are allowed right of way over the ball as long as they are in the their running lane. Their running lane is where they are standing to a straight line to the next base. So your average MLB player might lead off a good 5-8 feet off 3rd base line. They are allowed a path (the rule of thumb is about 3 feet each side of their current stance) to home plate. 

I worked on a golf app many years ago that helped map out courses in the midwest region and offer golfers help on the course - and for them to see the holes on their phone. We had TONS of statistical data available to us and actually had a pro that was also a stats major and he found some really interesting things. 

So I give you some reasons Nebraska dominated for 25+ years. I would like to know why Notre Dame became Notre Dame in college football. What gave them a recruiting advantage, what made their program great before it was great? 

You can catch a teammate after they catch the ball to keep them from getting injured. Even if an opposing player tried to catch someone to keep them from getting injured, this is fair - umpires call on intent. Now if a teammate assists/helps before the catch is made I am calling interference every single time. It is simply "interference" which can be called on an out or safe call and can go either way. The section below is included in the definition of a catch in the MLB rulebook: 

As for defibrillators - it couldn't hurt but I doubt would help much either. Most of the issues are around tears/holes around the aorta/valve/heart. This is not like baseball where you got a sudden shock to your heart by being hit with a ball in the chest. 

When do guys go to the stretch: When there is any runner on base. Even with a man on third almost all pitchers would be in the stretch. Pitchers don't practice stepping back fast so their backwards step to forward motion could take longer than a second which would allow average runners to take home. 

The main difference between a person suited for a 3-4 outside linebacker vs a 4-3 outside linebacker is their ability to get off the ball and play at the line of scrimmage. Starting with a head of steam from 4-5 yards away is very very different from lining up across from a man and beating him off the ball. This takes more initial burst and leverage. While blitzing from the second level takes timing and agility and speed. At almost all levels your DEs are the core of your defense. Coaching pee-wee through college I can say my first pick would be a left defensive end (left because most QBs are right handed). You don't know how many stud players I have tried to "turn" into a DE but they eventually went back to linebacker. I call these players my "thinkers". At 4-3 outside linebacker you want your "thinkers" there. These are players who read the ball well, analyze plays, reacts to blocking patterns, reacts to route patterns and so on. Now your 3-4 outside linebacker is a "doer". This guy just wants to go. You can line him up on the line and he will play like a D-lineman. You put him in coverage though and you usually have two options. He can cover the short flat or he can man up on a TE or back. Put him in space he will think too much. You don't want your attack dog thinking when a crime is taking place - and a team trying to get a yard on my defenses is a crime! There are very very few players I have coached that are both "thinker"s and "doer"s. Well maybe there were a lot but there were very very very few that were really good players that could do both. If I labeled you a "thinker" or a "doer" those are big skills and you were a good player, and if you were a hybrid you were probably 2nd-3rd string. Some other notes: 

Scenerio 2 - This is a bit sketchy. You don't get to stop after taking two steps after a pass. In a continuous motion you should have shot from this position. Let's say it isn't a travel. Then one of your feet will be established as a pivot (the one you move last) and then you are back to scenario 1. Scenario 3 - This again sounds like a travel. You don't get a a step and a jump after dribbling unless you are shooting or passing. You can't take 2 steps and stop somewhere. 

In my opinion if you did this right you would set the right attribute to the right stat. For instance a batter who hits a one hopper to the right fielder and trips on his way to first, that is really a 1B and baserunning error. The at bat resulted in a "hit". The baserunning resulted in an out. So in conclusion the rule is absurd. If scorekeepers get to give a third basemen an error after he lays out for a ball but then bobbles it, well they can handle these obvious baserunning issues a few times a year. How you score things is up to your league and if your league doesn't have rules it is up to you. 

Your son doesn't need archery classes. But you need to read up on safety guidelines and share these with you son. This becomes more of an issue if your son has friends practicing with him - it is pretty hard for someone to get hurt alone while practicing archery (or hurt badly). As far as the YMCA classes... I would ask for thorough proof that the person giving the class has serious knowledge of archery. Most YMCA classes consist of them hiring a teenager and the teenager going over their class "sheet". There is just as good of a chance that your son will get worse habits rather than better habits while going through a generic Y class. I would either pay extra for a pro - who may make you son a lot better (while preaching correct safety) or do nothing. And this pro will probably give your son more tips in 20 mins than a Y kid in 20 lessons - and this extra knowledge will make your son happy. I would start with your local ranges and ask if they know of any pros/experienced shooters that offer classes. 

The baseball rulebook is rather ambiguous when it comes to launch points for pitchers. I have a strong feeling that within the next few years we see pitchers try to take advantage of whatever they can will happen and then eventually we might see actual rules that define exact things that need to happen. Right now umpires get a situation book that gives examples - we used to receive these every spring. It would go over trendy things and tell whether each was acceptable or not. To answer your question there really isn't legal/illegal in baseball. If a pitch doesn't follow the rules is a balk. A pitcher has unlimited balks. Each balk without a runner on base is a ball. With runners it is a base and a ball. 

Note that you have good answers - and this isn't an answer per se but too long for a comment. However this rule is just stupid. It is antiquated and has carried over because of MLB - at all lower levels I am sure they would change this and some leagues have rules overruling this (see later). MLB hasn't changed it because: 

I have worked with several colleges on advanced stats and have used them on the high school/pee-wee/college levels. I have thought about yards after contact for receivers but I don't understand how to maintain an evenness across the board to gain a meaningful stat. For instance yards after catch is not subjective. Boom where did the ball hit his hands and how far did he go. But even this stat tells almost nothing. Runningbacks have the most YAC because they generally catch the ball even or behind the line (for the most part) and they obviously gain yards. WRs who are the leaderboards generally focus on quick slants and bubble screens. Are they a "better" receiver or more dynamic because of this? Hmmm. Maybe. By how much? Not sure. Is the high yards after catch a byproduct of teams worried about deeper routes, is it because of superior edge blocking, is it because this receiver can't run his route tree correct so the coach only trusts him with short stuff and streaks? Now take your stat which in a well defined lab would probably give decent analysis but first of all how do we define contact? It is very very subjective and you would need the same person (or cloned people) to evaluate all of the film. If a defender's shoulder pads brush against a WR as they try to jump a hitch contact? Is a defender hand on the back (which unless the WR is wide open is almost a norm in the NFL now) contact? Is a fist coming down trying to strip the ball contact? If a receiver catches a screen and jukes the CB that is less than a yard away is that contact (and said CB makes no contact)? There would have to be 50 "rules" in place to get this stat. I would say that a first rule would be that contact includes any defender making contact in a tackling motion (no matter how pathetic the motion is since most NFL DBs can't tackle) or a defender in very close proximity (where an immediate tackle would be the norm) is juked/side-stepped. This stat I am sure would have some sort of relevance to how well a QB throws into tight spaces and I am sure the big name QBs would have WRs near the top of the list (because those guys have the most yards). However a couple problems off the top of my head.
