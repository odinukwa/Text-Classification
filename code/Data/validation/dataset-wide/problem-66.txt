He/it doesn't need to sleep and eat. Nor also his cell decaying (so he would never aging and still always be on top of his condition). He is stranded on a place that there is nothing there except sandy ground and peebles. It is limitlessly vast, and always basking on a gentle light, there's no night and day, like it always like early morning ambience. Weather change is also absence. On top of this situations he just not going crazy, or desperate so he killed himself. He always looking for an activity to amuse himself. 

Supposedly we human are able to terraformed Mars decades from now, then in few hundred years able to enhance our genes to be more adaptable to live on harsh conditions, creating space colonies and starting to live on moon, Jupiter's moon, all the way to Saturn. Supposedly we also invented FTL travel between our colonies, and planets in solar system. As dates and years will become very relative, it would be a disaster in daily basis to scheduling for 3D video call meeting, or planning some events if human still count days and years like we do now. So what will be the best way as the universal standard time keeping in this situation? It's more about the substitute of days/months/and years count that we used now based on earth rotation and revolution, what's the other alternatives that can be socially accepted that's not linked on just one planet movement? Sun movement can be accepted as we deal with just one solar system. (Hours/second would easily solve able using whatever precise time counting device that we will have in the future.) As @cort Ammon has showed the linked question in here. I've revised the question, since I've checked and still not found the answer. Thank You 

Organized Synesthesia is the biological version of multimedia arts. Within the brain, synesthesia occurs as an interpretation of sensory data from a sense organ that is somehow associated with a type of sensory data from a different sense organ. The idea of hearing smells and tasting emotions probably leads to disorganized thoughts, but enhances the synesthete's pattern recognition abilities. But by making the recognizable patterns available for correlation to consequently develop entirely new "meta-senses" arising from those correlations, maybe we can re-organize thoughts even better. The simplest example I could give would be a sensory ability made for sentient photosynthetic organisms, designed to find the optimal light settings to have enjoyable meals with maximum nutritional value. Simply put, a creature can taste the rainbow and the sunlight by having: 

Empathic Telepathy Everybody knows telepathy is simply a remote transmission and reception of thoughts. Adding empathy to the mix however, allows the broadcast of emotions, feelings, sensations, experiences, among similar abstract concepts, that all seem to be very differently interpreted by each individual as based from their own experiences and memories. 

If you mean by without maintenance really means is without human maintenance: then how if you build a forever learning and adaptable ai that can maintain and update itself included in the structure. At first it can deploy a not far future drones to maintain the system and building and later can upgrade itself, learn and discover more technologies, even search and harvest materials it needed from the nature far after human had no longer existed. There's one beautiful story involving a structure like this as its 'main character' its a manga by Boichi $URL$ 

For a long time I had imagine that the most advance human can do if we can learn and practice magic and other mysticism like we learn at schools like hogwarts while also interact and develop technology and science nowadays. In this scenario, in our world nowadays some group of peoples manages to spread virally a ton of ancient knowledge of magic that can be practised by anyone and it really worked. Like any other things that spread on internet, the government late to contains it and it have already spread troughout the world. The rules: 

What can I say, other than such a race will possess the maddest parkour skills. If such extremely developed senses are accompanied by an extremely agile musculature, micro or high g's will have little effect on their physical performance. Not only will underwater sports become popular to them, but even aerial and orbital playground will have such strong appeal to their species they'll probably be better living offworld within bizarre artificial habitats, a la parkour heavens. Aside from being space ninjas, they'll also be highly sensitive to any stimulus across the senses in their body-map. Therefore, their surgery and tracking techniques will also be as awesome. If they're not gifted with innate full-organ or full-limb regeneration, an individual can perform transplants by itself. As a species, they'll quickly advance towards transhuman-equivalents since body modifications are the next generation of self-operated transplants. One downside I can say though, is that they'll have trouble meditating, or sleeping at that matter. Since they are sensitive to the minutest enviromental changes and its effects within their bodies, they'll probably require dampener drugs or hormones that will minimize their sensitivities whenever they need to relax. They'll be ninjas or surgeons or ninja-surgeons at best. At worst, they'll be paranoid addicts or sedentary monks. 

And for the Crabs, I agree that it would be like Geonosis from starwars from the global view of their cities. Since we can draw from their nest of their real counterpart that have been found. 

Magic and mysticism right here ranging from elemental magic mastery, make astral projection of ourselves, necromancy, curses, to manage chakra, anti magic charms, basicly almost anything except time magic (while as a soul we can re-see the past, and catch a glimpse of possible future),and telekinesis are restricted to lifted what we can already lifted by our muscle, tough we can joined together to lifted more heavy items. (but yeah everybody can do the avatar element bending ability, light a stick, and do magic battle like harry potter, with proper trainings). Learn magic will be like learn to drive. While simple task are able to be mastered by anyone (any functional human being can learn to sparks a fire with their fingers) some high magic needs to spent your lifetime to master, like necromancy, and you still can command a horde of zombies since it would need you to learn to control two or more bodies while you still just have one brain (No real ressurection magic, but there's advance healing knowledge). Learn the magic is like learn to alter the 'code program' of the universe with our will. While spells and incantations helps, we do not really need it if we grasp its concept. And it is also affect to develop our perspective on physics. Our science and technology will also get a big leap, since we know our nature and metaphysics better. The knowledge would also include a history of sentient beings before us, and also legendary creatures, tough we will immediately known that they are ceased to exist now. We still don't really know about how the universe created, and wether there's some advance alien life form still exist out there. Telepathy also real, while you still can't easily do mind reading/ mind control since people at normal conditions with little practice can developed a subconscious 'wall defense' on such attacks. Teleportation knowledge is there, but no human could do it. While it is difficult we can learn transmutation, and law of equivalent change still apply. Thus you need more than water to turn it to wine. 

With these in mind, together with the assumption that the magnetic charge of a monopole is directly propotional to its mass, then theoretically, magnetic equivalents of nucleons and electrons (called magnuclei and magtrons respectively) can stably exist as magatoms. Magatoms, having large charges, will typically have larger masses and also greater internal attraction-repulsion forces, therefore making them extremely dense, but also extremely strong materials. A magatom may be imagined as a big north pole orbited by small south poles. 

Noumenal Conveyance Noumenon is the opposite of phenomenon. It is a thing as itself, an object's fundamental existence as opposed to a thing as represented by other things. If somehow, other sensory perceptions, correlations, and interpretations, are heightened and integrated altogether as to build a comprehensive copy of reality within the mind, wouldn't that create noumena out of raw phenomena? Likewise, a multimedia communication system that involves recreating the noumena by exhibiting all their constituent phenomena should be possible as well. A thing-as-itself can be made communicable by integrating and exhibiting the thing-as-it-appears from different sensory perspectives
