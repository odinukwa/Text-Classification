I keep hearing astronomers saying there are observatories scanning the skies all day and night looking for near-Earth objects, extrapolating their trajectories. My questions are 

Currently, people don't even think about it; Governments are cutting spending in their space exploration programs, let alone deflecting an impact-er. Under certain circumstances, would the notice from the watchdogs be enough for us to build something that would prevent the loss? 

Suppose an amateur astronomer finds himself watching Solar Eclipse. He can see the stars around totality. Is Sun's GR effect strong enough for the amateur astronomer to be able to tell that a particular star is appearing a few arc-degrees (or arcminutes, or arcseconds) away from where it should? If not, what is the minimum requirement to be able to witness GR for yourself during a Solar Eclipse? 

I am getting conflicting accounts everywhere. I heard astronomers saying is a 3-star system. Some say they are binary but are optical-doubled with a 3rd. Phil Plait a renowned astronomer wrote in his book that is sextuple star system. 

I just learned about Brown Dwarfs, they are "failed" stars, they narrowly missed the stellar mass mark. I learned that Y Dwarfs have temperature as low as 80 Fahrenheit (The first one found by WISE observatory), why aren't those not called a Jupiter-like planets without a host star? Why do we call them a star and designate a separate category for them (T or Y)? Ok suppose T and Y dwarfs are okay, let's leave them alone. But why can't Jupiter be a Y Dwarf who is in the binary relationship with the Sun? Sun-Jupiter's Barycenter is just outside the Sun, we could call them in orbit with each other correct? 

I love Einstein's explanation of "events". Not the exact words but he stipulated that an event has not happened until the light of that event has reached you. So, the Sunrise time is when you actually see the disc of the Sun, not when it has actually been in your line of sight for a person who might be standing on the surface of Mercury observing you and Sun both. 

If we were to get the news of an on-coming object, how early we will find out or how much time we will have? 

While in his He said was a Pentuple star system. Now, I am not saying is doing anything wrong. I am actually a fan of him, enjoyed reading the books he authored. He may have said one or the other by mistake. I tried asking him this question, it does not look like there is an effective way to submit him an Errata or ask him questions like these. So my question is, how many stars are and are they all gravitationally bound to each other or some of them are just grouped? 

Surface gravitational acceleration on an object with mass $M$ and radius $R$ is given by $$ g = \frac{GM}{R^2} \propto G\rho R $$ where $\rho \propto M/R^3$ is the density of the object. Titan is larger than Earth's Moon, so it must be less dense. Wikipedia confirms: 

There are also some charmonia with $(2S)$ and $(2P)$ in their names. There don't appear to be any definitively labeled $d$-wave charmonia. 

Each line here shows the observed brightness of a particular star observed from a particular location at the same time. You can see clearly that some observers saw the star disappear very briefly, some for longer, and some (who might have been predicted to be in the very center of the path) saw no occultation at all. Assembling all these individual observations, properly synchronized, shows clearly the shadows of the two parts of a binary asteroid, each of order 50 km in diameter. Note that 90 Antiope is a main-belt asteroid. The angular diameter decreases linearly as the distance increases, so an object the same physical size orbiting out by Neptune (perhaps fifteen times farther) would need fifteen times the density of observing locations to create an image with the same detail. 

The thing about detecting exoplanets by eclipses is that the eclipses are repeatable. You have the same star, whose light curve dims in the same way with each eclipse, which gives you information about the planet's orbital period and its apparent size relative to the star. The Kepler mission observed many fluctuations in stellar brightness that were not associated with exoplanets, but instead with changes in the instrument, fluctuations in the actual brightness of the star, probably some other explanations that I can't think of off the top of my head, and actual mysteries. Basically, if you can only observe it once, then you can't claim to explain it. Occultations of distant stars by planets or comets don't give you a light curve: the star goes from "on" to "off". So a single occultation doesn't give you any information about the size, speed, or direction of the object doing the occulting. And the occultations are sufficiently rare that I think you'd be extremely unlikely to find a "line" of them by chance --- though that would make a fun data-mining project for an astronomy student. What you can do, if you have an object that you already know about, is to make many observations of the same occulatation. That's the mission of the International Occultation Timing Association.
