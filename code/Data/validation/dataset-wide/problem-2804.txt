is analytic is because that is how the word is defined; however, think of the etymology of the word "triangle." We have two morphemes, "tri" and "angle," and it is a matter of fact that you cannot have three angles connecting three lines that do not add up to 180 degrees (in Euclidean space, at least). So really, that statement is on par with the self evidence of the sentence 

Which clearly shows that there is a contrasting view as to whether the logical contradictions can be used to show if time travel is possible or not. This statement is echoed in two other articles on the SEP: Time Travel and Time Travel and Modern Physics. In the second article the author states: 

France has no present king, therefore the sentence cannot be true. However, it wouldn't seem right to say that it is false either, because that would mean "the present king of France is not bald" is true, which it also is not. So, how can this sentence be meaningful (how can we understand it?) if it doesn't reference anything? Russell uses his theory of descriptions to analyze the sentence as really expressing a conjunction of three sentences: 

Both of these definitions say that a sound is a vibration that can be heard when they reach an ear. Does that mean that the vibration needs to reach an ear to fully be a sound? This dictionary seems to imply that is not the case, but it is not explicit. In philosophy, one of the most important things you do is make a careful effort to fully explain the meaning of the terms you are using so as to clear up any ambiguities. There are arguments that the definition of "sound" is vague enough as to not require that the vibrations actually are heard by an ear, merely that they would be interpreted as a sound if they were. Of course there are also more strict definitions that require the vibrations to reach an ear for it to be a sound. So the answer is: it depends on how you define sound. The philosophical aspect of this question isn't a metaphysical one about what trees or vibrations or anything else are like. It's an example of how philosophy requires you to use explicit definitions to clear up potential ambiguities. We know that if a tree falls it makes a vibration, we know that if that vibration hits an ear it will be heard as a sound, so is it a sound before that? That question is purely semantical and depends on the definition of "sound" whomever is asking is using. 

In physics there is a differentiation made between "vacuum" and "void". From an article entitled "How Feynman Diagrams Almost Saved Space" by theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek: 

So, because it is logically equivalent, you can view functions as something that maps variables and or constants to variables and or constants or you can view them as predicates that map variables and or constants to truth values. The next thing to understand are interpretations and model theory. Remember that a model of a set of axioms is a pair of sets (D,I). D is the domain of the model and I is the function that maps members of the domain to the variables, functions, constants, and predicates of the formal language. This is the formal language interfacing of semantics and syntax. In a minimal form of PA we have variables, one constant "a", one 1-place function "F(x)", and one 2-place predicate "P(x,y)". "a" is the constant which when we give it an interpretation will become the number 0. "F(x)" is a function that will take a variable, or the constant, and map it to another variable, which when we give it an interpretation will become the "successor" function, which maps a number to its immediate successor. "P(x,y)" is a predicate that takes two variables or the constant and maps them to a truth value. When we give P an interpretation it will become the identity function, or "=", and will map to a True truth value if and only if x and y are the same. Peano Arithmetic is made up out of a bunch of variables, one constant, one function, and one predicate. When we give it an interpretation (the natural numbers and our understanding of zero, successor, and equality) we are then presented with a system that works the same way that arithmetic works. Note the idea of composition of functions as well. The successor of 0 is 1, the successor of 1 is 2 and so on. We can come up with a new function, "A(x,y)", which starts at x and applies the successor function to "x" "y" times. This, of course, is a recursive definition of addition. Recursive definitions can be created for multiplication and exponentiation in the same way. Note that you don't need to introduce addition, multiplication, or exponentiation to get arithmetic. Those functions can just be viewed as "short hand" for successive application of the successor function. Finally, remember that I said before that Russell showed us we can eliminate n-place functions and reintroduce n+1-predicates in their place. To do this with the successor function we would create a new predicate, S(x,y) that maps to a True truth value if y is the successor of x. Consider these two examples: 

So it is not at all plainly evident that we should consider ourselves consistent formal theories, even if we are Turing machines. It could be the case that our mind works algorithmically, obeying the Church-Turing thesis on a physical level, but that our axioms are inconsistent and therefore we sometimes will produce false statements even if we follow an algorithm. This is a subtle point and deserves a lot of attention when discussing these matters. The final point, which really brings it all the way back to the disclaimer at the beginning, is that it isn't at all clear what "our mind is a Turing machine" means. Personally, I am a subscriber to the computational theory of mind but I also recognize that there is philosophical, as well as neuroscientific, work left to be done in regards to fully fleshing out what this position says and how we should understand it. In a paper, Incompleteness, Mechanism, and Optimism which surveys the Lucas-Penrose argument, Stewart Shapiro opens the section on the nature of the computational theory of mind (mechanist's thesis) thusly: 

The legendary filmmaker Ingmar Bergman oftentimes is described as incorporating the language of existential philosophy into his films. Common in his work from the late '50s onward are characters who experience a strong sense of angst and hopelessness after questioning their faith in God (The Seventh Seal), the crumbling of their personal psyche (Through A Glass Darkly), or otherwise some sort of horrifying tragedy in their life (Cries and Whispers). Although Bergman was a filmmaker, his personal stances on a large amount of existential topics are expounded by the characters and narratives of his films, much the same way Dostoevsky's views are found throughout his fiction. There is no shortage of film scholarship on Bergman's work, but I am wondering if any philosophers (continental or otherwise) have written on his ideas in the same way they would treat Dostoyevsky, or even Sartre's or Camus' fiction. Have any philosophers written about Bergman's philosophy of how we as humans should cope with angst and the crumbling of personal identity? How does Bergman's analysis of these topics and offered solutions compare to those of, say, Kierkegaard, especially concerning Bergman's conception of the silence of God (The Seventh Seal)? 

(i) can be summarized as saying that a transitive verb is intensional if substitution of a coreferential phrase in the verb phrase has the ability to change the truth value of the proposition. Notice the phrases "can change" and "has the ability to change"; it is not necessary that the truth value does change, only that it can. (ii) can be summarized as saying that a transitive verb is intensional if it allows for what is called the de dicto / de re distinction (it is also referred to as the "relational/notional ambiguity"). (iii) can be summarized as saying that the object of the verb phrase does not need to exist for the proposition to be true. Criterion (i): Referential Opacity The example the article uses for criterion (i) is between Lois Lane and Clark Kent/Superman. It is clear to everyone who reads the comics that Clark Kent and Superman are the same person. However, Lois Lane, Clark Kent's love interest, does not know that they are the same person. We then can analyze these four propositions, keeping in mind our knowledge of what Lois Lane believes: 

linguistically in this specific sentence "only" is what causes the difference between "if" and "only if" however I think that this raises a lot of the questions that come with using natural language to model formal logic (or vice versa, this example is slightly dated but see section 6). There are other ways to express the concept "P→Q" in English: 

Notice that he states (11) can be rewritten as (12), and I honestly have absolutely no idea why he randomly jumps to using Principia colon punctuation instead of parenthetical, but (12) is identical to (7) (given that the delineating punctuation doesn't have some secret meaning that eludes me) he is saying that (11) is also identical to (7), and reading (11) out loud you get the statement that ≺ is logical implication LM, and → is physical implication PM. 

In the Apologia Socrates tells the court that the Oracle at Delphi told him, through a friend, that Socrates was to be a great philosopher. The argument is made that when Socrates refers to a singular God he is referring to Apollo, as Apollo was the specific God who guided him to his wisdom. The general response to this from the scholars who believe that Socrates is monotheistic is that it is clearly different when Socrates refers to one specific God who is Apollo and one specific God who is the one deity that exists. For the sake of more examples to illustrate why people believe that Socrates was monotheistic even though he mentions both the Gods and God, see this excerpt from the Republic: 

An empiricist should treat string theory as they do any other theory. They should study the theoretical framework as well as the experimental evidence and if either (1) There is no ability to ever test the predictions (2) An irreconcilable contradiction is found in the data are proven to be true then they should abandon the theory. As of now, neither of those have happened so the theory should not be abandoned. At the same time, an empiricist wouldn't be doing their empirical duty if they accepted string theory as being true without evidence. Supersymmetry (Witten) is integral to string theory and any evidence of it, while it does not out right prove string theory, is more evidence that corroborates the story. The paper you linked briefly mentioned experiments concerning the quark-gluon plasma and it states: 

These are just some examples of papers that have had the biggest impact on the field by some of the field’s leading figures. They with undoubtably come up as you are reading over a history of the field, and a majority of the world done by later philosophers references either these papers themselves or responses to these papers, especially in the philosophy of language. I’ve seen it stated by many people that Quine’s Two Dogmas is the most influential philosophical paper that came out of the 20th century, but I currently don’t have a link to a citation on that so take that statement as anecdotal conjecture; however, it is without a doubt one of the most. 

So, taking the definition of gender to be a collection of rules, behaviors, activities, and attributes of an individual, we can argue that a change in these would fall in line with the definition of personal identity. Someone's personal identity can be seen as the answers to the question "who am I?" that they would give. Consider that there is a transgender person named Alice, and Alice lived for twenty years as a man. At that point in her life she realized that she was transgender and wanted to be treated as the woman whom she felt she was. If we had asked her when she was 16 who she was, (maybe at that time it would have seemed appropriate to say "who he was" depending on the circumstances) she might have said something about her interests and her desired career and being someones son and so on. However, after she has had her revelation about her gender, her answers to that question would completely change. She would no longer identify herself as someones son, she would identify herself as a woman and a daughter. In this way, her personal identity has in fact changed with time. We could also consider the situation in which Alice as having known since she was 6 that she felt more like a girl and that was how she wanted to be identified. We would then need to look at her different behaviors and activities, as suggested by the WHO definition of gender, to evaluate whether or not she has had a change of personal identity. At any rate, personal identity is different than the general metaphysical idea of the identity of a material object. It would not be well supported to argue that a transgender person is a different material object before and after they come out. In terms of personal identity, philosophy treats these issues by asking about things like social and psychological identification, as well as others. A transgender person may be, and most likely are, a different person after their transition, in terms of personal identity. In regards to the three points made at the end of your question, a philosopher might make the arguments: 

Here Aune is saying that (7) cannot be true. Parsing what he said, he is saying that no one would want it to be the case where ~(p ≺ q) ^ (p → q), (p does not logically entail q AND p physically entails q), under this symbolism, is true. Since (False ⊃ True) results in True, it would be possible for ~(p ≺ q) ^ (p → q) to be the case, if (p ≺ q) ⊃ ~(p → q) is granted. 

The uncertainty of the results is a clear indicator that this is not, of course, an irrefutable proof of the language of thought hypothesis. The hypothesis states that all mental thoughts have a linguistic structure which is contained purely in the mental facility of the thinker. We won't know if the neural networks truly do have this interlingua until we have more data from future experiments. A suggestion for further experiments would be to test the hypothesis presented by Schulze that: 

A categorical syllogism is a syllogism that uses these types of propositions as their terms; our above example with Socrates is not one because it only uses a categorical proposition once, "All men are moral," the other two propositions are not categorical because they are not an example of one of the four above definitions. Aristotelian logic (syllogistic logic), propositional logic, and first-order logic are not the same thing. They all use deductive rules, however. Natural deduction is a specific type of deduction that is applied in theories stated in modern logical systems (zeroth, first are our examples) to derive theorems from given axioms.
