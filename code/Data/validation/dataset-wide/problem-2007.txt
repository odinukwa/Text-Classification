Although not exactly the same as a written reference that you would provide a potential employer; using LinkedIn to build your professional profile and gather references/recommendations should be standard practice for just about anyone in the professional workplace. Many HR people and hiring managers are going to be looking for your profile online anyway, why not take advantage of the tools available to you and make a habit of keeping it up to date. As a general rule of thumb: 

In this particular case answering the first question may solve the vast majority of the second problem. Your policies are already in SharePoint, it's archaic that you are following the manual process that you describe. In SharePoint you have the tools and infrastructure you need to easily automate this process. SharePoint is quite capable of sending email, collecting input, and tracking user actions. It can also send the reminders necessary for those that haven't completed the process. A few hours of time by a SharePoint administrator could easily automate the whole process and relieve you of what's obviously a very tedious task. Depending upon how SharePoint is integrated into your overall infrastructure you could also easily force an employee to complete a given action before allowing them to continue with their other daily work. For example a login action that opened the form every morning when they login to begin the workday. 

I'd refuse this outright or at least consult an attorney before signing. I've read of similar terms that were ruled as unenforceable but it's not worth the legal cost you'd incur if you were taken to court. 

Sounds to me that you're over thinking this. Obviously you've established that you're more than willing to help others and this person is simply taking advantage of you. It may be out of ignorance, being overwhelmed, or he/she could simply be a jerk. The why really doesn't matter because it's up to you to establish the boundaries and those boundaries are the same regardless of the why. Simple solution, although it may be awkward for you, is start establishing your boundaries and being more assertive. There is absolutely nothing wrong with saying 'No.'! You can be as polite or abrupt as you like, but you need to make it absolutely clear when they have crossed the line. I'd suggest starting out polite and escalating your response if the bad behavior continues. 

Simply tell the client that you'll accept these terms, but since the NDA would prevent you form working for one year after the termination of the contract that you expect full payment of one years contract rate. So joking aside - Edits - 

Outlook tasks if you're using MS Office. There are also a number of plugins available to semi automate the process. A spreadsheet log. Most accounting packages (Quicken Professional, Freshbooks, ...) offer basic time tracking and invoicing. 

Absolutely, in a nutshell it's call teamwork! There's very little technical knowledge that you can't pick up on your own in one form or another. But the bottom line is that working in a team environment can be a great learning experience. There are a lot of other benefits to working in a team. The ability to share and bounce ideas off of knowledgeable team members is a great learning experience. Often times you'll see things from a different perspective from your current one, and this is an extremely valuable skill and mindset to develop. You'll also gain insight to the combined years of experience that the team has. Believe me they've more than likely tried your approach before and learned from the experience; their insight into the pitfalls and gotcha's that they ran in to will save you a lot of headache and pain. I've said for years that programming is as much artistic/creative as it is technical. The technical knowledge comes from school and training, where the artistic/creative aspects come from experience. Working in a team environment provides you an immediate pool of experience to pull from. 

If your company supports/allows 'work from home' then you need to make every effort to include those working from home in these meetings. Omitting someone from a meeting because they are working remotely and you don't have the basic resources needed to accommodate them is both insulting and counter productive. Investing in a good quality device like the Polycom CX 100 mentioned in another answer is cheap compared to the loss of productivity and morale. 

As a practical matter this all depends upon the company, so in all honesty only they can give you a real answer. Some companies adjust salaries according to location (local law, tax rate, expenses, ...) others don't. If you're dealing with a recruiter it's perfectly polite to ask for advice. But there's no guarantee that you'll get a straight answer or even if they know the answer. The one question that the recruiter should be able to answer quickly, if you don't already know, is the salary expectation at each location. Research and research some more. You need to have enough knowledge of the tax rates and expenses in each location so that you can determine if one offer or location is better for you than the other. The government websites for each location would be a good starting point. If and when you get to HR I'd think it would be perfectly acceptable to ask the HR representative about this directly. They deal with it on some level already so should have the background to point you in the right direction. 

In my mind the answer is an an absolute 'Yes', but I don't know the culture and norms of your company. What I'd consider normal and expected behavior/process may well be a slap in the face to your managers. Are you typically involved in interviewing others in your department? If your input, insight and participation are generally expected in the interviewing process there's no reason it shouldn't be expected now. However if you're not typically involved in interviewing that's a pretty good indication that management either hasn't considered your participation or has make a decision to exclude you. If this is the case broach the subject with your manager casually and with a leading suggestion that you might be helpful in selecting your replacement. But don't push the issue. 

Building your contacts, endorsements, and recommendations on LinkedIn has a lot of benefits for you. It provides the tools and means for easy contact with previous associates, a highly visible professional profile, a means of managing and archiving recommendations (even if not visible publicly). For many professionals LinkedIn is the preferred means of business networking. Use it to stay in touch and maintain at least an online relationship with all of your contacts. 

Most employers and managers would take asking for a letter of reference as an indication that you are, or are seriously considering, seeking other employment. In most US states that in itself would be perfectly legitimate grounds for termination. A possible exception would be if a supervisor/manager that you've worked with is leaving the company. In that case I would consider it appropriate to ask that person before they leave. But that in itself might be questionable as far as your employer is concerned, so it might be best to request contact information then follow up with them after they left. 

Most NDAs forbid disclosing details about the project or work that you've performed, or otherwise exposing proprietary information. Even though some may try, they can not prevent you from discussing your work in broad terms. For example if you developed a web service API for the government under security restrictions and an NDA you couldn't (and shouldn't) discuss the details of the project. But there is noting wrong with describing your work in broad terms. Following the example, I'd suggest something like. 

Connect with your professional peers. Connect with immediate supervisors. Connect with other supervisors and management members where appropriate. (Obviously if you're a junior level developer and you've said only two words to the CEO during the course of your employment/contract it may not be appropriate to connect with them; use your judgment here.) Ask for recommendations from immediate supervisors or senior team members. Add skills and if needed ask for endorsements from those that can vouch for your skills. ( Again use common sense; an endorsement from the receptionist about your high level programming skills just doesn't carry any weight.) 

Obviously if someone walks up and tells you the system is down you need to react. But you should also ask for the email so the issue is documented. 

I've come back and re-read this question several times in hopes of getting past my gut reaction on the first read. Commenting or replying based on emotion is a risky business so I always try to take a step back before opening my big mouth. The emotional response is over and done with, but I still have the same reaction in spite of ample time to digest and re-read your question. I don't know you at all and it's nearly impossible to determine a person's real character from a post. So please take what I'm about to say at face value and not as a direct criticism of you. I'm only offering my reaction; which may or may not be your co-workers reaction as well. 

The first and often overlooked step in dealing with any inappropriate behavior or comments in the workplace is letting the person know that you are offended or uncomfortable with what they have said or done. Despite what you may consider appropriate social/workplace norms; not everyone is aware that they are making you uncomfortable and they won't know unless you tell them. Obviously if the jokes/comments continue then you will have to make a decision as to how far you're willing to go with your actions. But you have to take the first step. I've always told an employee to make this first step before escalating to a manager or HR. The only exception would be if you felt that the possibility of physical or sexual violence was likely. 

The idea behind your question is reasonable and one that I've taken in many interviews over the years. I've never reacted badly to the question nor has it been received poorly when I've asked it. But the way your phrase your question would certainly cause me to react badly if I was interviewing you for a technical position where your responsibilities included deployments and documentation for example. You've basically just said that you don't consider those tasks important or part of your technical responsibility. You've pretty much told me that: 

Although you're asking specifically about following up here I think your have a much broader issue facing you that you'll need to deal with. You taking the initiate to follow up is great, but if your outsourcing company isn't putting out the effort to find your next engagement you have bigger fish to fry. First off you don't indicate if you are in a contract role (i.e. no pay while on the bench) or in staff role (i.e. paid bench time). The distinction is fairly important because it does effect how your company approaches placing you. Obviously if you're in a staff role and being paid for your downtime the company has made an investment in your career, so they are more apt to quickly place you in another project or use your skills for other task such as interviewing, assisting with prospects that fit your technical knowledge, or evaluating potential projects. If you're purely a contractor then obviously you're losing money while on the bench. And although your employer isn't making its cut they certainly aren't shelling out cash for you to sit around the house. Many consulting companies are well known for promising the moon as far as their need for your skills; not only on the current project but on future projects as well. Despite these promises a great deal of those companies are only concerned about the current project or requisition, regardless of what they've told you in the past. If they are not putting out the effort to place you then they are clearly indicating that they either don't have a need for your skills, are not satisfied with your history/performance, or are simply being short sighted. If they really wanted to keep you in the stable you'd be hearing from them every other day or so even if it was only to say they haven't found anything yet. Either way I'd suggest you start looking at other outsourcing companies to partner with. When doing that I'd ask specifically about the average bench time for their stable. Although I'm sure this isn't current I've read before that a 30% bench/down time is very common for consultants. While my experience with one company in particular was less then 1% bench/down time over the course of seven years. Obviously your mileage will vary. 

How do I stop wasting my time on a very manual process? How do I get reluctant or hesitant employees to state that they read a policy? 

Yes I'd include a picture on your Linkedin profile! I've been told in several career workshops and by social media experts that I work with that Linkedin gives higher priority in search results for profiles that do have an image attached. From personal experience, my contact rate via Linkedin has increased dramatically since adding a profile picture. Make sure to use an appropriate picture. Something that you wouldn't mind providing to your employer to put on their own website for the company directory. 

In the travel industry negotiated rates are, for the most part, determined by the amount of travel and bookings. This includes hotel room nights, air segments, car rentals and so on. In the corporate realm committing to a single agency often gains several benefits: 

As I said in my comments: the how you ask is important as well. And in this case the how would have prevented you from moving forward in the process at all. Simply asking 'How much time is spend on non-job related tasks?' would open the door for you to ask more pointed and direct questions without tipping your hand. 

Directly contacting a higher up can be risky; some will take it as a positive while others will be extremely annoyed by it. So unless you know the individual you're contacting you are taking a risk. But this is exactly where networking comes in to play. While it may be inappropriate for you to contact a higher up directly it's usually perfectly acceptable for someone in your network to introduce you in person, via email, a phone call or other setting. In this case someone within your network already has a direct connection and an established relationship. Obviously if you have submitted a resume directly to an individual it's perfectly acceptable to contact them and follow up on your application. 

A centralized and standardized travel purchasing and approval process. Easy access to the whereabouts of an employee while they are traveling. Reduced rates for most, if not all, of your travel needs. .... 

Now in your case you may be able to find and make travel arrangements cheaper than your corporate agency. But your company loses the benefits and the ability to negotiate for better rates because they can't easily determine how many air segments, car rentals, hotel nights you've used in the past. It's a short term loss (more expensive now) but has a long term gain (less expensive later) for the company or organization. 

Once you have accumulated a history you'll have empirical data to communicate your concerns and the problem to your manager. I'd even go so far as to speak with your manager before you start this process; if he's worth his salary he should already have identified the issue and be working on a way to resolve it. In an ideal world: 

Stating a broad and high level description of your project wouldn't violate your NDA. This gives the prospective employer enough information to make an informed decision to bring you in for an interview. Which is of course your goal at this stage. Obviously in an interview you'll have keep to that broad and high level description. Most interviewers are well aware of NDAs and wouldn't push you to break it. 

All good advice here, but in many companies/cultures having a few drinks with clients is expected. You need to do two very import things that haven't been mentioned. 1) Understand your companies policy regarding drinks (or other after hours meetings) with clients. 2) If you do have drinks, know your limits and don't pass them. A few drinks is one thing, but going over your limit is something else entirely. 

I hope that this answer doesn't come off as a bit insulting, but I can't figure out how else to say this.
