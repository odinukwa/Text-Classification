It seems there is little to add after Russ Woodroofe's nice answer, but anyway: If at each time $t=0,1,2,\dots$, we draw two balls without conditioning on them having different colors, then the probability of drawing two different colors at time $t$ is $$\left(1-\frac1{\binom{n}2}\right)^t.$$ This is because the number of pairs of balls of different color will stay the same every time we draw two balls of the same color, but decrease by one in expectation every time we draw two balls of different colors (that pair will become of the same color and everything else cancels!). Running the process to infinity, the expected total number of times we draw balls of different color is $$\sum_{t=0}^\infty \left(1-\frac1{\binom{n}2}\right)^t = \binom{n}2.$$ 

Gerhard did not mess up. $\binom{r}{r/2}$ (or more precisely, the central binomial coefficient, but say $r$ is even) is an upper bound. If we shuffle the primes and multiply them together in random order, then the probability that we hit a given product of $k$ primes is $1/\binom{r}{k}$ (since it requires the first $k$ primes to be a specified set), and therefore at least $$\frac1{\binom{r}{r/2}}.$$ It follows that the probability that some partial product is in the given interval is at least $N/\binom{r}{r/2}$, where $N$ is the number of divisors in the given interval (since we never stay in such a short interval). Being a probability, this number is at most 1, which gives Gerhard's bound. My guess is that in reality that probability is more like $\log 2/\log r$, since if instead we add up the logarithms of the primes, we move in steps of size roughly $\log (r\log r) \sim \log r$, and we look for the probability of hitting an interval of length $\log 2$. This would suggest that $$N\approx \frac{\log 2}{\log r}\cdot \binom{r}{r/2}.$$ Edit: I'm fairly convinced that $N$ is of order $\binom{r}{r/2}/\log r$, but I'm not so sure about the constant $\log 2$, though it seems it gives asymptotically an upper bound. 

I am considering the following situation. Let $M_5$ be a 5-dimensional manifold which is an $S^1$ principal bundle over 4-manifold $M_4$. For instance, $M_5 = S^5$ and $M_4 = \mathbb{CP}^2$ with standard Hopf fibration.Now there is a principal G-bundle (or associated bundle $adP$) over $M_5$. My question is, how to characterize $P$ over $M_5$, and is there a canonical induced bundle over $M_4$? Let me explain my question a little bit. I know that, for even dimensional manifold $X$, characteristic numbers (integrating over $X$ the characteristic class built up by curvature) can efficiently characterize principal. But in odd dimensional cases, I'm not sure how to do similar thing. One thing I can imagine is to integrate characteristic classes over all even-dimensional cycles. Secondly, suppose there is a way to characterize $P\to M_5$. Then I would like to know if there is a natural principal induced bundle $P'$ over $M_4$, and how to use the data of $P\to M_5$ to describe the induced bundle $P' \to M_4$. If possible, we can take some simple cases. Say, the Hopf fibration. Principal $G$-bundles over $S^5$ are characterized by $\pi_4G$, and they are $0$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$, as I check a list of homotopy group for Lie groups. If I take trivial $G$-bundle over $S^5$, do I get a trivial bundle over $\mathbb{CP}^2$ (do I get new "twist" in the process of inducing bundle)? And what about other situation? Thanks. 

My goal to write down an explicit (and simplest) contact metric structure on squashed $S_\omega^{2n + 1}$ defined as \begin{equation} S_\omega ^{2n + 1} = \left\{ {\left( {{z_i}} \right) \in \mathbb{C}^{n + 1}\;\;|\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n + 1} {\omega _i^2{{\left| {{z_i}} \right|}^2} = 1} } \right\} \end{equation} For the contact 1-form I would use the natural one restricted on $S^{2n+1}_\omega$ \begin{equation} \kappa \equiv \frac{i}{2}\sum\limits_{i = 1} {\left( {{z_i}d{{\bar z}_i} - {{\bar z}_i}d{z_i}} \right)} \end{equation} Take $n = 2$ as example, I use parametrization \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{gathered} {z_1} = \omega _1^{ - 1}\sin {\rho _1}\cos {\rho _2}{e^{i{\varphi _1}}} \\ {z_2} = \omega _2^{ - 1}\sin {\rho _1}\sin {\rho _2}{e^{i{\varphi _2}}} \\ {z_3} = \omega _3^{ - 1}\cos {\rho _1}{e^{i{\varphi _3}}} \\ \end{gathered} \right. \end{equation} and if I am calculating correctly, the Reeb vector field will be \begin{equation} R = \sum\limits_i {\omega _i^2{\partial _{{\varphi _i}}}} \end{equation} which generates rotation $\left( {{z_1},{z_2},{z_2}} \right) \to \left( {{e^{i\omega _1^2\theta }}{z_1},{e^{i\omega _2^2\theta }}{z_2},{e^{i\omega _3^2\theta }}{z_2}} \right)$ (Since that $\kappa \sim zd\bar z$ has $\omega_i^{-2}$ coefficients, so $R$ will need $\omega_i^{2}$ to kill these ugly coefficients and leave some $\sin$ and $\cos$ so that $\iota_R \kappa$ to add up to 1). 

Of course a highly non-convex polygon may have equidissections none of which are star-like, and it is easy to see that this might be the case also for convex polygons: Take a regular hexagon of unit area and label the vertices A, B, C, D, E, F. If we replace the vertex at A by a vertex at a point A' on the line through A parallel to the line BF, then the new hexagon still admits an equidissection into six pieces by cutting along the triangle BFD (and dividing the middle piece into three). But there are only countably many choices of A' for which there is some point P such that the six triangles with vertices in P and two adjacent vertices of the hexagon all have rational area. So perhaps the answer to my question is the obvious "No, why should it?", and the reason I haven't found a counterexample is just that dissections into a small number of pieces tend to be star-like. There is a short comment on the second page of this article that shows that the spectrum of a trapezoid is closed under addition, but I don't see how that would generalize. 

This question was posed by my colleague Torbjörn Lundh in his paper Which Ball is the Roundest? A Suggested Tournament Stability Index, Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports 2(3), 2006. We have discussed it a number of times without finding a solution. The context is a tournament, where $n$ players or teams meet pairwise in games. We assume for simplicity that each game results in one team winning and the other losing (no ties). Given the results of all $n \choose 2$ games, the task is to produce a ranking of the teams, that is, to order them from best to worst. This sort of problem goes back at least to the 19th century, and arises when a number of subjects are asked to rank for instance the taste of different wines. It's hard to directly produce an ordering of say ten glasses of wine based on tasting them. It's much easier to repeatedly make pairwise comparisons, is wine A better or worse than wine B? But the final answers need not be consistent, and we arrive at the problem of interpreting a series of such pairwise comparisons. One possibility is the method used in sports tournaments, where teams are ranked according to the number of won games (with various tiebreak rules when the scores are equal). But we might also be interested in the ranking that minimizes the number of inconsistencies, that is, minimizes the number of games that are won by the lower ranked team. 

I have a very stupid and non-specific question, as follows. And let me know if I am asking in a wrong way. We known that, for instance, if one is interested in computing dimension of moduli space of 4d instanton, then one can study the deformation complex, and find it elliptic, and then usual index theorems applies. Now suppose I am interested in some $d$(odd)-dimensional instanton-like equation, and would like to know its moduli dimension. But it turns out that the deformation complex is far from elliptic, which looks like $0 \to {\Omega ^0} \otimes \mathfrak{g}\xrightarrow{{{d_A}}}{\Omega ^1} \otimes \mathfrak{g}\xrightarrow{{\pi ^\circ {d_A}}}H \otimes \mathfrak{g} \to 0$ where $H$ is a sub-bundle of $\Omega^2$ with unfortunate $rank\left( H \right) \ne d - 1$. At some special points on the moduli space, I can "choose a good gauge" and replace the above bad complex with an elliptic once, but in general I am faced with this bad one. So the question is: Does it mean that the dimension of moduli space cannot be described? Is there other ways (other index theorem) to compute the dimension? 

In Blair's book and many many literatures, I see definition of a contact metric manifold which involves a relation \begin{equation} d\kappa \left( {X,Y} \right) = g\left( {X,\Phi Y} \right) \end{equation} as well as other standard relation like ${\Phi ^2} = - 1 + R \otimes \kappa $, $\Phi R = 0$, etc. On the other hand, in Tanno's papers and a few others literatures, the definitions involves \begin{equation} d\kappa \left( {X,Y} \right) = 2 g\left( {X,\Phi Y} \right) \end{equation} differing from Blair's by a factor of $2$. So I try to figure out which is "more correct", and then comes one important equation that really confuses me, in Blair's book (Lemma 6.2): \begin{equation} {\nabla _X}R = - \Phi X - \Phi hX, \;\;\;\;h \propto \mathcal{L}_R \Phi\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(*) \end{equation} Now, let us consider the contact metric structure to be K-contact, and therefore $h = 0$, ${\mathcal{L}_R}g = 0$, and also equation $(*)$ should still hold, hence (in components) \begin{equation} {\nabla _X}R = - \Phi X \Leftrightarrow {\nabla _m}{R^n} = - {\Phi ^n}_m \Rightarrow {\nabla _m}{R_n} = - {g_{nk}}{\Phi ^k}_m\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(**) \end{equation} On the other hand, since $\nabla$ is Levi-civita, we have \begin{equation} {d\kappa } \left( {X,Y} \right) = \left( {{\nabla _m}{R_n} - {\nabla _n}{R_m}} \right){X^m}{Y^n} = g\left( {X,\Phi Y} \right) = {g_{mk}}{\Phi ^k}_n{X^m}{Y^n} \end{equation} and therefore ${\nabla _m}{R_n} - {\nabla _n}{R_m} = {g_{mk}}{\Phi ^k}_n$. Now comes the final point: using the Killing vector equation ${\nabla _m}{R_n} = - {\nabla _n}{R_m}$, one obtains \begin{equation} - 2{\nabla _m}{R_n} = 2{\nabla _n}{R_m} = - {g_{mk}}{\Phi ^k}_n \end{equation} which directly contradict the equation $(**)$ So my question is 

More precisely, I am interested in the "Bose-Mesner Algebra" point of view on this scheme. It is known that all the matrices in the algebra defined by this association scheme diagonalize in the same basis. 

Hi, I have no idea where to look for, so I'm hoping you can give me some pointers. I'm interested by numbers of form $p-1$ when $p$ is a prime number. Do they have a name, so that I can google them? More precisely, I'm interested in their factors. Ok, obviously 2 is a factor, but what about the others? Are there a lot of small factors? Do we know the rate of the growth of its larger factor, is it linear, logarithmic? Thanks. 

-- Some background on Association Schemes. An association scheme is a set of symmetric boolean matrices $A_1, \dots , A_S$ such that 1) $\sum_{i=1}^s A_i =J$ the all-one-matrix 2) $A_1 = I$ the identity matrix 3) $\forall i,j \; A_iA_j \in {\rm span} ( A_i )$ The matrices $A_i$ can be seen as adjency matrix for some graph (but I don't think it might help here) The span{$A_i$} defines an algebra called the Bose-Mesner Algebra. Condition (3) implies that all matrices commute so they diagonalize in the same basis. -- In the case I'm considering here, the dimension of the $A_i$ is ${M \choose N}N!\times {M \choose N}N!$. The $A_i$ are not explicitly defined but we know that $[A_i]_{fg}=[A_i]_{f'g'}$ if there is a permutation $\pi\in S_M$ and a permutation $\tau \in S_N$ such that $g = \pi \circ f \circ \tau$ and $g' = \pi \circ f' \circ \tau$. -- About the Johnson scheme: The $A_i$ have size ${M \choose N}$. The rows and the columns of the matrices are labeled by subsets of size $N$ of {$1,\dots,M$}. (in my case, the labels are injective functions, ie. ordered sets of subsets of size $N$ of {$1,\dots,M$}. $[A_i]_{ab}=[A_i]_{a'b'}$ if there is a permutation $\pi\in S_M$ such that $\pi(a) = a'$ and $\pi(b) = b'$. (where $\pi(a)$ denotes the subset of {$1,\dots,M$} obtained by applying the permutation $\pi$ to the elements of the sets $a$. 

Here is an argument that shows that the expected number of drinks is $m^2/2$ for $m>1$, as noted by Barry Cipra. This is equivalent to saying that the expected number of drinks that an arbitrary person $A$ takes is $m/2$. Let $X_m$ be the expected number of drinks per person with $m$ participants. If $m\geq 2$, we get the equation $$X_m = \frac{m-1}m\left(1+a_2X_2+\cdots + a_mX_m\right),$$ where the factor $(m-1)/m$ is the probability that person $A$ picks somebody else's umbrella in the first round (otherwise he drinks nothing), the term 1 comes from the drink this causes him to take, and $a_k$ is the probability of exactly $k$ people picking someone else's umbrella in the first round, conditioning on $A$ doing so (trivially $a_0 = a_1 = 0$). Since $a_m(m-1)/m\neq 1$, this equation uniquely determines $X_m$ if we know $X_2,\dots,X_{m-1}$. Therefore we have the right to commit the cardinal sin of assuming that the induction step does go through, and just check that the resulting equation is consistent! Provided $X_k=k/2$ (linear!) for $k=2,\dots,m$, we can replace the terms $a_2X_2+\cdots + a_mX_m$ by $(m-1+1/(m-1))/2$, since the expected number of people who take their own umbrella, given that $A$ doesn't, is $1-1/(m-1)$ (it is 2 if he does). The equation then reads $$\frac{m}2 = \frac{m-1}m\left(1+\frac{m-1+\frac1{m-1}}{2}\right),$$ which simplifies to...I can't resist... $$0 = 0, \qquad \text{QED}.$$ 

Here is a more careful (EDIT: even more careful!) argument that gives an affirmative answer to the weaker version of the question (as stated in the edit to my previous post, I doubt that the stronger version is true). The argument uses the following lemma, which ought to be known. If someone has a reference, please leave a comment. Lemma: Let $a_1,\dots, a_n$ be real numbers with each $a_i\geq 1$, and let $X_1,\dots,X_n$ be independent random variables, each uniform on $\pm 1$. Let $I$ be an interval of length $2r$. Then $$Pr(a_1X_1+\cdots+a_nX_n\in I) \leq \frac{1+r}{\sqrt{\pi n/2}}.$$ Proof: Let $f(X)$ denote $a_1X_1+\cdots+a_nX_n$. In the Boolean lattice of all assignments of $\pm 1$ to the variables $X_1,\dots,X_n$, consider a random walk starting from the point where all $X_i$'s are $-1$, and moving in $n$ steps to the point where they are all $+1$, in each step choosing uniformly and independently of the history a variable which is $-1$ and changing it to $+1$. What is the expectation of the number $N(I)$ of steps of this walk at which $f(X) \in I$? On one hand, $N(I)\leq 1+r$, since $f(X)$ increases by at least 2 in each step. On the other hand, the probability that the walk passes through any given point in the Boolean lattice is at least $2^{-n}\sqrt{\pi n/2}$ (this probability is minimized at the middle level(s) of the lattice, and the claim follows by well-known estimates of the central binomial coefficient). Therefore $$EN(I) \geq \frac{\#\{X:f(X)\in I\}}{2^n}\cdot \sqrt{\pi n/2} = Pr(f(X)\in I) \cdot \sqrt{\pi n/2}.$$ It follows that $$Pr(f(X)\in I) \leq \frac{1+r}{\sqrt{\pi n/2}}. \qquad \square$$ As was explained in the earlier post, we can randomly choose $n$ pairs of opposite points $\{z_i, -z_i\}$, then find $z$ with $\left|P(z)P(-z)\right|=1$ given only this information, and finally fix the $z_i$'s by $n$ independent coin flips. In order to apply the lemma, we want to have, before the coin flipping, $n/2$ pairs $z_i, -z_i$ making an angle of say at most $60$ degrees with $z, -z$, so that each of the $n/2$ corresponding coin flips determine the sign of a term of at least $\log 3$ in $\log\left|P(z)\right| - \log\left|P(-z)\right|$. Actually, after choosing the $n$ pairs $z_i, -z_i$, this a. a. s. holds for every $z$. The idea is to divide the circle into, say, 100 equally large sectors. With high probability, every pair of opposite sectors will contain at least $n/51$ pairs (as opposed to the expected number, $n/50$). We now condition on the outcomes of the coin flips for the smaller terms (pairs $z_i, -z_i$ more or less orthogonal to $z$). The lemma above tells us that for any interval $I$ of length $4\alpha\sqrt{n}$, the probability that $\log\left|P(z)\right| - \log\left|P(-z)\right| \in I$ is at most $4\alpha/\sqrt{\pi} + O(1/\sqrt{n})$. In particular, with probability at least $1-O(\alpha)$, the absolute value of $\log\left|P(z)\right| - \log\left|P(-z)\right|$ is at least $2\alpha\sqrt{n}$, and since $\log\left|P(z)\right|=-\log\left|P(-z)\right|$, $\max\left(\log\left|P(z)\right|, \log\left|P(-z)\right|\right)\geq \alpha\sqrt{n}$ as required.
