I would like to ask a question about ones last will and how buddhism views that. In Denmark where i live we have an option called a "life testament". In here there are 2 options that will be taken into account if one becomes severely ill or are about to die. 

I have been thinking a bit about this question and have come to the conclusion that practicing mindfulness in this way may lead to suffering. Why? Because it seems to me that in the western way of practicing mindfulness one is doing it for a specific purpose, meaning that one has expectations to the practice. One expects a result. One thereby has craving. In the buddhist way of practicing mindfulness one learns about the 3 signs of existence and the 5 aggregates. With proper practice that leads one to understand that there is no such thing as an eternal, permanent Self. If one practice mindfulness with another purpose than the aforementioned one then one will not reach the understanding of the false idea of Self. One will instead reinforce the belief in a Self which in turn leads to further suffering and attachment. The buddhist practice of mindfulness is all about training to see phenomena clearly, as they really are and in that way it leads to the giving up of craving. It seems to me that the western way is the opposite and thereby it might lead to further suffering and attachment. Another point i want to make is that i think the practice of mindfulness becomes more ineffective when taken out of the true context which is the buddhist way as described by the Buddha. One cannot just take such a profound teaching and turn it into something else. Its like having a puzzle with 1000 bricks and then taking out 5-10 bricks and trying to complete the puzzle with only them or like trying to drive a car without having a license. I want to state that i have not tried the western way of mindfulness and i know noone who do it so i might be completely wrong about it. 

Yes, that would be one way of dealing with the hindrances. This is the first method. If that does not work, one moves on to the second method and so forth. Methods are described below. 

So as the Buddha teaches one needs to: a) abandon or dispel already arisen unwholesome states of mind and b) to guard against or prevent unarisen unwholesome states of mind from arising. The latter is done by guarding the sense-doors. The former is done by administering the antidote for the 5 hindrances. One can deal with each of the 5 hindrances in 5 ways, i.e. the following 5 methods works for all of the hindrances. Methods are found in The Noble Eightfold Path, p. 63-66, by Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi. 

The above quotes are concerning the earth and water element out of the four great elements which belongs to the 1st aggregate of form. The above words of course is the same for all the aggregates. So regarding your question; if you take out the I, Me, Self is there then a problem? Everything becomes problematic and confusing when a Self is added to the equation. It reminds me of a story told by Ajahn Punnadhammo. The story is from Zen buddhism and involves a man looking for the owner of an empty house and not finding him. Then who is doing the looking? Ajahn Punnadhammo then explains that no one is doing the looking. There is nobody home. When one does insight meditation and come to see that all phenomena are impermanent and unsatisfactory one will then come to understand and realize not-self. So in short. Its useful to contemplate such questions as you ask but only to a certain extent. One should not get obsessed with such matters since intellectual knowledge will not get one far. Insight practice is the way to go. Direct investigation and examinination of reality. That produces wisdom which will grant one access to understanding reality by realizing the drops of pure insight. I hope this might be of some help. On purpose i did not answer the relation between Dependent Origination and Right Effort because as i understand it the combining factor was "an experiencing I, Me, Self and when that is added to the equation the question becomes meaningless. Like when the Buddha was asked questions about e.g. the infinite/finite universe i.e. The Four Imponderables and The Ten Indeterminate Questions. Here the Buddha remained silent. Why? Because he knew that the question was framed in the wrong way. The question was already flawed from the beginning impliying something that is not there. Through practice you will get an answer to your question but it might be an answer much different that what you think or expect. You might realize that there wasnt a question to begin with. Lanka 

What you are seeing or describing here is the impermanent and uncontrollable nature of conditioned phenomena. The ultimate solution is to win Nibbana, the unconditioned. Here there exists no arising or passing away. While in Samsara, you can practice Vipassana meditation and change meditation object according to whatever arises. You don't have to note everything. Try to balance the faculties to ensure restless and agitation does not arise. Eat and be mindful of the entire process and if/when another object comes into contact with a sense door, e.g. the ear-door, note that object and return then to your primary meditation object, i.e. the eating-process. The below Instructions for Mindful Eating is given by Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw. Note that these detailed instructions are used on retreat or when you have enough free time to practice in this way. If not, then use general awareness of the eating-process. 

It depends on what kind of intention is motivating the search for happiness. If the intention originates from the 3 unwholesome roots, then yes it is considered wrong view as actions based in these roots cause further suffering to arise by enforcing craving and thereby the bondage to Samsara. If the intention originates from the path factor of Right Intention in the Noble Eightfold Path, i.e. the intention of Renunciation, good-will and harmlessness, then it is considered right view. To attain deliverance requires the complete eradication of craving - not by force but by understanding. True renunciation is about changing our perspective on conditioned phenomena through the practice of (insight) meditation. This leads to understanding the nature of craving and with keen attention and investigation the mind is able to let go of craving. This leads to true happiness, i.e. a happiness that is pure, unconditioned and permanent. If one is practicing Buddhism, motivated by right intention, in order to attain that kind of happiness, then it is not wrong view. 

There is also a reference to The Visuddhimagga, chapter 8: "Mindfulness occupied with body", verses 42-144, p. 236-258. Here it gives in-depth instructions on how to perform the technique and it takes all body parts and describes each in detail. Lastly, Pa Auk Sayadaw gives a description of this type of meditation in his book "Knowing and Seeing", p. 44-46: 

That it is purely speculation, a belief, contained in the 4th aggregate of mental formations. This is clearly visible through the practice of insight meditation. 

I just listened to a audio dhamma talk by Ajahn Punnadhammo. Its called "Stop thinking" and can be found here. In the last 5 minutes of the talk Ajahn Punnadhammo mentions some good exercises for learning about reality. He says that a good exercise is to try to be conscious while entering the dream state from waking state because the stages of falling asleep exactly mirror the stages of dying! He says its like a sneak preview of what happens when one dies. My question is; if one trains in this and succeeds in being aware and conscious throughout the death process and into the next life will one then be able to remember the previous (this) life? Thank you for your time. Lanka 

See this article "What Does It Mean To Be Enlightened?" by Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi. In this article it is explained how the Buddha views enlightenment. Its based on a conversation the Buddha had with a Brahmin where the Buddha explains what is meant by a "Buddha". This is the Buddhas own words: 

In the Anguttara Nikaya, The Buddha mentions the Middle Way in relation to the practice of meditation: 

You might find this book useful: "Practicing The Jhanas", by Tina Rasmussen and Stephen Snyder. They were both students of Pa Auk Sayadaw and undertook a Samatha Meditation Course under his guidance. They write in the book how they achieved the 4 material jhanas and the 4 immaterial jhanas. 

And here is the book "The Noble Eightfold Path" by Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi. You might check out the chapter IV: "Right Mindfulness - Samma Sati" to get a fuller description of it. Its very well described. Another thing i would like to mention is the obstacles to meditation and the practice of being mindful of the present moment. This teaching is called "The Five Hindrances". You might have heard of them. They are what keeps one from developing in meditation. They are briefly: 

Buddhism does not answer such questions, since they do not lead to Nibbana. The Buddha said himself, that he teaches only the cessation of suffering. It's not that these questions are not important or interesting, they certainly are, but they will not lead one to Nibbana. They will only distract and agitate the mind, leaving it unfit for practice. If you really want to know the answers to these questions, not only intellectually but experientially, then you have to become a fully enlightened Buddha (SammƒÅsambuddha). Then you will be able to know everything, that there is to know. The questions you mention, fall under the "Four Imponderables (Acinteyyas)": 

By the way the question is framed it implies that buddhism accepts a creator God or Universal Consciousness. Buddhism do not accept any of them. The Buddha refuted both the eternalist and annihilationist view as being 2 extremes that cannot take place. A creator God and the Universal Consciousness belongs to the eternalist view. By saying that there is a creator God one is saying that there exists a first cause. That can never be true since it will break causality by asking "what preceeded this first cause?". And further "what cause preceeded that cause which preceeded the first cause?". One can do that endlessly and will thereby stumble into infinite regress. In short your question is not related to buddhism. Lanka 

There is actually a term describing this method of combining different religions. It's called "Eclectisism". Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi has a section on it in his book The Noble Eightfold Path, p. 2-3: He writes about how religions and traditions have different ways of practice and that they were not "made" to be compatible with each other. So by combining them one risks having methods of practice that go against each other and thereby giving a blurred picture of a path that might not lead to liberation. 

Noone can answer that but yourself. The aversion that arises from the current job can be used as a vehicle for developing insights. Try to observe that aversion and learn about it, try to understand it. Pain, aversion, suffering is our greatest teachers. Try to be mindful on the job when you are standing up for long hours, maybe with pain in the legs. Observe the pain, observe the feelings in the legs and very important, observe the Mind and see how it reacts to these feelings and pain. The problem arises when we identify with pain and feelings or with "our" job or career. You will see that the desire to change job is based on the aversion from this job. Desires, aversions are conditioned phenomena, meaning that they are subject to birth and death. They are impermanent and will both change and fall away over time. Mindfulness is one of the wholesome mental factors (cetasikas). When mindfulness is present it will be much easier to make decisions, since there are no "I, Me or Self" involved. Wholesome actions produce wholesome future results.
