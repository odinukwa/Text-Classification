While I am not currently looking for a new job, I occasionally peruse the job boards on the off chance I find something more in line with my interests. Many of the positions I see have a laundry list of requirements which I don't possess, or find unattractive. How can I motivate myself to learn these skills that I wouldn't pick up otherwise? 

Lately is has become more common to omit the start date, and sometimes even the end date of a degree on one's resume. One reason is that not everyone takes the recommended full course load every semester when getting their degree. I certainly didn't, and when I did include both the start and end dates on my Bachelor's, I was never questioned about why it took so long to complete the degree. 

That is perfectly acceptable, and is basically the regular advice of Liz Ryan, an author and advice columnist for job seekers. Normally, you would send what she calls a pain letter, describing how you have faced problems similar to those they are facing, and human-voiced resume directly to the hiring manager via snail mail. 

Generally, as you gain professional experience, you should be dropping your educational achievements off your resume. You could include them in your cover letter, if, for example, you know the hiring manager went to the same school, and the academic achievements would be highly relevant to the job. 

To establish a contractual relationship, you should formally acknowledge the purchase order (and therefore acceptance of their terms and conditions). It costs nothing to be polite when doing it. Without the acceptance they're actually left hanging as to whether you're really engaged, because usually the P.O. imposes additional conditions that were not present in your quote, so it's really another offer, not the acceptance of an offer. Typically you will find a lot of boiler plate text on a purchase order that is (not surprisingly) entirely in the favor of the purchaser-- it's worth reading it and seeing just what you are agreeing to. At some point you might want to have a lawyer draft up a pro forma contract that cancels out the most egregious of that B.S. If you're in a field where large amounts of value are being handled, or safety could be an issue, you need to do that first. 

Have you fully considered any risks? I wonder if there is a possibility that your side project would be discovered and you could be accused of developing a product using company facilities to take with you to another venture. If your colleague is or is not seen to be at arms-length relationship with you it might make a difference to the overall perception. As well, if your assigned work is late or deficient in any way, the semi-authorized work could be blamed. 

And some hints not directly related to background check, but to your hiring process and job description: 

If you do it this way you must be prepared to show exact informations about your work history if asked. Maybe also hint about that in the cover letter. They musn't get the impression that you want to hide something. 

I hope I have interpreted your question right. If your Job includes meeting people from your business, that's good. Networking is not about becoming close friends, it is more like building an address book. Talk to the people you are meeting and ask them about what they do (most people like to talk about themselves). Maybe exchange business cards, or just memorize the person. Try to get information from as much fellow businesspeople as you can. Tell them about yourself in exchange. If you don't meet as much people (or wrong ones) in your daily business life, go on trade shows or other events targeted at networking in your part of business. This is a longtime process. If you meet one of your former contacts again, do smalltalk, be visible, update them about you and vice versa. The whole point is that they should be able remember you. If everything works out ideally, soon you will have a full address book / spreadsheet / customer management program full of contacts. And this is basically all it takes. The people you have met don't need to be your friends. They just need to know who you are. If they have a problem/need info from your field, they will remember you and call you. The same applies to you. Problem? look it up in your address book. Giving and taking favours is what the network is for. This keeps on running smoothly as long the other guys/girls don't forget you. So talking briefly once and calling the guy 10 years later won't work. A network needs constant care. 

Write the information in a Word document and print it 'n' times. It doesn't have to look like a card. Print it on pink paper or whatever if you want it to stand out. I would not go about designing my own business card without documented permission, companies can get snippy about that sort of thing- technically you'd be violating copyright on their logo, for example. 

If you are applying for TN status, you should make sure you have the required fee and documentation (including an appropriate letter from the employer) at the border inspection, otherwise you're not going to be admitted. 

If your employment contract does not prohibit it, then it comes down to the laws in your jurisdiction, local culture and any other restrictions. For example, licensed professionals may be required to adhere to a code of ethics that prohibits such 'moonlighting' activities without written knowledge of all parties, even if their personal ethical standards and laws applicable to the general workforce would permit it. 

I understand that you are upset that a co-worker buggered up and lied to implicate you (apparently getting away with it), but if there is no proof I would not expect for the company to necessarily do anything visible to you. The fact you felt they believed you and you did not receive a reprimand yourself is an indication. In the other cases you mention involving minorities (and the majority of the work force) there may have been no doubt about where responsibility was, or the worker was honest and owned up to it, so reprimands were easy to dispense. You might want to ask your manager privately and verbally about the situation, if you are on good terms. They may be building a case to dismiss the person for all you know. Going to a hotline or HR and crying discrimination is really a nuclear option. You can be pretty sure they have written documentation to cover each of the reprimands - you could easily be on thin ice in trying to prove a negative. 

As someone who's worked in a rather small cubicle for the last 5 years, and a couple of years in a previous role, I have to say no, it's not rude. Nor do I expect my co-workers to stand when I enter their area. The only exception may be if the co-worker needs to sit to type something on your computer, such as to install software or make some sort of configuration change or the like. 

Yes, this is completely common, to avoid lawsuits, should someone at the company give out false or damaging information. It shouldn't affect you getting a job elsewhere. In this case, you should probably say you were let go due to downsizing. Typically references are former co-workers or managers who can vouch for your quality of work. 

In addition to Jane's answer, if they have posted the job on LinkedIn, or somewhere else that you can link to, then there should be no problem with you sharing it with your LinkedIn contacts. Also, if you know a contact who might be a good fit, you can always send them a message mentioning the position, and offer to pass their resume directly to the hiring manager, with your recommendation, a potential win for both of you. 

Skip the HR, and send the hiring manager a well crafted resume and personalized cover letter describing how you're a good fit for the job. Send it via snail mail, as opposed to e-mail, to make it more likely for the manager to read it. 

There is a reason why people are issued offices, and it's not just for the ego boost. Partly it's so conversations (personal and on the phone) can be private, but also typically we might have confidential documents such as performance reviews and such like around when we're not. I would say lock the door and have a slot installed for papers, if you think that's necessary. Management should be on your side on this. 

I can tell you that, for me, having Mensa on a resume would act as somewhat of a negative from a hiring point of view. I deal with and hire highly educated and highly capable people almost exclusively (post doc to masters), and this would not be a good indicator of a team player in my estimation. It would also not help with mediocre academics, it would actually hurt because I would judge that the person will quickly get bored with the less interesting stuff I have to get them to do, and will just phone it in, like they did before. Others may well feel differently (if you have intelligence, as it were, that the interviewer is also a Mensa member, it might help). I'd rather see some kind of extracurricular activity than a club membership (maybe in your case you've contributed to open source or answered SE questions). 

Don't leave the impression that you are ashamed of your work history. Be upfront about it, you are the best and everyone should know that. Side note: If many of your positions were very similar or too minor to talk about, you may consider grouping them under a single entry in your CV: 

If you are hired for 40 hours, you have to work 40 hours. If your work is done in less hours, you have to inform your manager that he can assign you more work. If there is nothing to do, you may choose to ask your manager if it's ok to leave early. Me in your place would keep track of the hours I did not work. If sometime in the future there is more to do, I can use those hours. Maybe it is also beneficial to keep your supervisor in the loop about your "minus"-hours. If you do, he can see that you have free capacity. That said, of course you can make any other agreement with your manager. I just wouldn't work less without confirming with the higher ups. 

Don't get yourself down. Yes, you are in the weakest position in that team. But you signed a contract and dedicate them your time. So you should at least be told what you can do in that timespan. If your manager does not assign you any work, do a lot of reading. If you are unsure what would be valuable for you or your future employer, try to ask a coworker. Lunch is a great time to ask such questions. "Hey, by the way, when you started here, what was the first thing you had to learn?" Try to do a little bit of smalltalk about what it takes to be a perfect junior employee in that company. Maybe that coworker has some tips about tutorials or example codes for you which you can go through. Just a side note: A company totally ignoring an intern may not be the greatest place to work. I have experienced that also in the past. If they ignore you as an intern, you will not get much more training and attention as a newly employed coworker. 

This being <'current year'>, I would suggest sending a Linkedin invitation to your new CEO, and mentioning in the invitation that you are looking forward to meeting them. I would not suggest otherwise approaching him or her personally before arriving on their doorstep. By the way, if you are the paranoid sort, there is always a small chance that the CEO is unaware that you were hired, did not approve it, and she or he will cancel your appointment. Less likely when your presence is a fait accompli. Sounds silly, but I've seen this (and rather worse) in startups. 

You'll have to figure out what you can live with and tell them that you need that. You told them the range was okay, apparently it isn't, and you should rectify that reasonably soon. Waiting for an offer and asking for significantly more money might be a negotiating strategy but it might also piss them off royally, and chances are they don't have the ability to offer much more. Don't be overly surprised if this is a deal breaker, but you've lost nothing if you couldn't live with what they can pay. 

You can, and should, tell them. You can also lead by example, by leaving on time yourself. If necessary, return after they have gone home. In some cultures (Japanese comes to mind) it's considered slacking to leave before your supervisor. 

Your manager is the one responsible for the project. You completed your task by telling him that there may be a problem. If he has a different opinion, that should be fine with you. If something crashes in the future because of non-action of your manager, it is not your problem. If you think this can get severe, document everything you told your manager. Write an email to him about your concerns, maybe cc-ing some others (but don't threaten him, this is only for documentation!). If he blames you afterwards about the crash, you have something to prove your innocence. Bottomline: don't let this get personal. You will do many "useless" or "wrong" tasks during your work life. This is okay as long you don't let this get to you, and you were not the one deciding it. 

If you can not be happy with a job, you can not be good at it. Most of the performance in a job or during studies depend on if you are interested in the subject/the field. If you don't like what you are doing you will never reach your full potential. This knows your employer, too. Make him aware of that, tell him that you fear that this job is not a good match for you and resign. Be as professional as you can about it, work your notice period and try to make the transtition as smooth as possible. If your employer is bitter about it, I would not consider it your fault (given you did everything you have to do).
