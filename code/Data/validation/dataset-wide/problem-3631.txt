As I understand it, you want to expand beyond the "power stroke" and consider pedaling in a "full circle". Starting just past the top of the stroke around 1:00 you would drop your heel slightly then gradually extend you foot somewhat during the power stroke, then extend it further at the bottom, sort of "flicking" the pedal across the bottom. Then, you would pull with your hamstrings during the "back" of the stroke, driving your knee up and pulling your toes up slightly as you go to prepare for the next power stroke. At the top you would flick your foot forward then repeat the whole cycle. It is easier to understand if you attempt each of these while pedaling a bicycle. If feels pretty natural after a small amount of practice. I would not necessarily say this is the "most efficient" way to pedal, but that it is the method that produces the most output. When Mountain Biking I use the full circle to accelerate or climb short hills. On a long hill I alternate emphasis from the power stroke to the back stroke to shift the load around while climbing. On a mostly level road I pedal full circle to maintain the maximum sustainable pace. You can read a lot of detail here. 

As far as I know, there's nothing you can do for preventing muscle soreness. But as soon as you get accustomed to the exercise, it should get better. As it basically boils down to providing nutrients to your muscle fibers, the quality of your nutrition matters as well, of course. 

Deadlifts (2 work sets of 4 reps) Press (3 work sets of 5) Ring Dips (3 work sets of 9) 1-Legged Squats (3 work sets of 7) Pull Ups/Chin Ups (3 work sets of 8-10) Inverted Rows (3 work sets of 8-10) Dumbbell Bench Press (3 work sets of 6-8) 

When I'm doing pull ups, I try to go all the way down until the arms are straight, but I do not lock out my shoulders. Recently, I thought in order to get a greater ROM, it might be a good idea to completely lock out my shoulders at the bottom. After the workout I felt a slight shoulder pain. Is there any real benefit in locking out shoulders? Or is it just bad for my shoulders and I should avoid it? 

You are right, for increasing muscle mass, training at intensity that allows you to perform 8-12 reps per set is reasonable. But note that it's not the number of repetitions per set that make the muscles grow, but the intensity of each repetition. If you are able to do more than 8-12 reps per set with a certain weight, the intensity of that weight has decreased for you, and training with that weight will not have the same effects than before, even if you increase the number of sets. 

I would guess that by running exclusively on a tread mill you developed a stride that relied on the forgiving surface. I run exclusively in minimalist shoes (Vibram Fivefingers) on pavement with no complaints now but I ran in traditional running shoes for over a decade and had occasional knee or plantar fascia problems. I also spent about five years running almost exclusively on gravel and during that time I had pretty severe knee pain any time I ran on pavement. It is clear to me now that my old stride included very hard heel strikes while the stride that I learned running in minimalist shoes does not. I can take off my shoes and run the same way barefooted with no discomfort (until the abrasion gets to the soles of my feet :-) Learning to run in minimalist shoes would probably require more of a commitment than you would want to take on, but I recommend visiting this Harvard web site on the biomechanics of foot strikes to get an idea of how to run with a forefoot strike, then practicing that with the shoes you wear now. If you can modify your stride you will likely relieve much of your pain. UPDATE: I just noticed the additional info you added. Running down steep hills definitely generates the hardest impacts so you should avoid them as long as you are experiencing pain. You could also consider walking down steep hills. Also, take plenty of time to recover between runs, perhaps several days. If you do not want to skip exercise for that length of time substitute walking between your runs. UPDATE 2: I should have linked to this video originally. It gives you a nice overview of the information you will find at the Harvard Barefoot Running website. 

As someone who has finally started incorporating triathlon training into my routines (been swimming and running a while), I think the two are vastly different. I started running long before I was swimming. When I jumped in the pool the first time, despite my cardio health, I couldn’t swim 25m. After months spent practicing form, endless repetitions, etc... I’m good for a mile or two. Running is going to be somewhat similar. Your body is going to have to overcome the initial shock of this new activity. Your heart rate will be higher, your legs will be more involved, and there will be minor little injuries you’re going to have the joy of discovering. I can’t run every day. My body won’t allow it. There has to be recovery time for me. It’s a far more intense (for me) exercise than swimming. You need to build up to 30 minutes - that’ll be roughly 5-5.5k for most novices. 

I think the most fitting thing would be Zwift. You’d need a bike and a smart trainer to set it up, which could be cost prohibitive, but it offers all the things you are asking for. You can join races, do FTP training, and get instant feedback on your workout. I think Zwift is now available with certain treadmills as well, but I haven’t looked into it. 

Losing fat and maintaining weight implies building muscle. Building muscle and losing fat at the same time is difficult, although there is the phenomenon that sometimes works for novices. The only thing you can do is 

For a watch with these "standard features", there is no other workaround than the one you mentioned. See also this wikipedia article. 

I would strongly recommend too get a pull up bar, some rings, or a suspension trainer. Maybe one of the latter two make sense for you, as they can also be used for many other exercises. If you don't want to buy anything, try to use a door for pull ups. I think in order to gain strength, 10 pound dumbbells are too light, you should definetly train with higher intensity (like 3 to 5 sets of 3 to 5 reps each for each exercise). But training intensities are another story... Of course you should keep doing pushing exercises as well to prevent unbalance. 

I'm wondering why is the single leg version of the deadlift is usually performed with stiff legs. For instance, exrx.net and most of the youtube videos that teach the single leg deadlift show it with stiff legs. What is the reason for this? Are there any risks when performing the single leg deadlift like the standard one? 

I think logging your food is probably going to be your best bet. Forget all the noise about what you should eat, when you should eat it, etc... That’s way more advanced than you really need to worry about at this point in time. Besides, sustainability is a major factor with permanent change. Anyone can stick to some fad diet for a little while, but very few do for life. The benefit to logging food is not just so you know how much you overate in a single day, but as you become consistent with it, it can do the following: 

I'm going to answer this based on some of the clarifications in the comments. Also, I'm going to throw in a few asides because I know the OP is only 16, and well, I'm sure we all wish we could go back to 16 again knowing what we know now. For starters, you are 5'8" and 87 kg (191 pounds) and 16 years old. Your resting metabolic rate based on this calculator, using a "slightly active" selection under daily exercise is approximately 1875 kcal/day. That means, your body uses 1875kcal to stay alive. By doing minimal amounts of exercise (taking the dog for a walk, traversing the hallways in school, etc...), you burn about 2578 kcal a day. If we can accept a general rule of thumb that a pound of fat equals roughly 3600 calories (it doesn't as pointed out in the comments, but isn't a bad rule of thumb), and you perform no extra exercise, then you need to eat about 2000 kcal a day to begin losing weight. This will put you at a modest loss of approximately 1-2 pounds per week. Really quickly, I want to point something out. I know you're 16, and most of your life you've been exposed to results that come nearly instantaneously. It's just the generation you've grown up in, through no fault of your own, but this is really important: Don't go out and try to drop all this weight in a matter of a week or even a few weeks. For one, being 16, your body is probably capable of dropping the weight in a few weeks. More importantly, though, is that rapid weight loss (more than 2 pounds a week) can have negative effects on your metabolism. For that matter, it can possibly be permanent, making it extremely difficult for future you to lose weight and keep the weight off. What I would recommend for you is to "clean up" what you're eating. Lay off the sugary foods: no sodas, donuts, snack crackers, cookies, etc... Try to eat a few more vegetables, some lean meats, and nuts (if you're not allergic). Also pay attention to your calorie intake and try to stay under that 2500 calorie threshold in a day. All you really need to do at this point, is just eat better. Couple that with continuing to swim, and also get into the weight room. I know weights can be scary, and they should be to some extent (you should respect the weights), but what the weights will do for you will change a lot. I would recommend spending $100 on the Athlean-X program and following it along under his guidance while also watching his videos. Perhaps the biggest danger in the weight room for someone your age is not setting your ego aside and trying to lift a lot heavier than what you're capable of lifting. Remember this: You don't see "gym fail" videos on YouTube because people are lifting light weights. You see those videos on YouTube because people are using crappy form in a dangerous way. Anybody who knows anything in the weight room won't think twice about the size of the weight you're lifting, but they might gawk at your horrible and dangerous form. So, if you can only lift 5 lbs. without compromising your form, then so be it, but no one will even notice. I assure you of that. If you're still hesitant about the weight room, then at least do the following: 

Recently I stumbled upon the 4minute pushups test, which challenges you to do as many pushups as you can within 4 minutes (you can pause anytime as long as the clock keeps running). I'm wondering what would be the best strategy for doing this (maximizing the number of pushups). One strategy would be to go do consecutive pushups until failure, rest for some time, then do some more. Another strategy would be to evenly distribute the pushups. For instance, if plan to achieve 100 pushups, then I could do 4x(25 within 1min), or 10x(10 within 24seconds), or 100x(1 within 3.6seconds). EDIT: To clarify my question: I'm interested in the optimal distribution of breaks and work within the 4mins in order to maximize the achieveable number of pushups. I think this question can be generalized to: Given a time range, how do I distribute work and breaks over time in order to maximize the total volume? For instance, I've read somewhere that long distance runners try to run the first half of a race within 51% of their target time, which means that they run with almost constant intensity. If this applies to the pushup challenge, we should do half of the pushups in half of the time. Applying the same reasoning again, we should do 25% of the pushups in 25% of the time, and so on. Eventually this would lead to pausing after each pushup (because then the pushups are perfectly distributed over time). Of course, another strategy would be the one suggested by Moses in his answer (starting with a high number of consecutive pushups and a long rest, than a smaller number and a shorter rest, and so on). I'm wondering if there is one strategy that is known to be superior to others. 

I have read about deep vein thrombosis on long airplane rides. Although I am in fairly decent physical shape, it's my understanding that this can happen to healthy individuals as well. Various articles I've read state that certain stretching and exercising can help to alleviate some of these problems. However, many of the articles don't really give specifics as to what these stretches or exercises might be. What stretches or exercises, either before, during or after the flight, can I perform to help prevent this condition? Obviously, confined space is an issue so something like burpees in the lavatory or sprints down the aisle aren't going to do. 

I can answer this. One day when you're my age, you'll turn your head at work to talk to a co-worker and you'll feel a pop in your neck. You'll go numb on the left side of your face, have shoulder, chest and arm pain, and suffer with mobility issues for months. Only after months and months of physical therapy will you be able to turn your head again. All this because the stabilizer muscles in my neck had to support my crap posture using phones, computers and other bad positions my entire life. Your head is somewhere between 12-20 pounds. It's the job of your neck muscles to support and hold the head. If you have poor posture like 99% of modern people, you'll slowly start wearing away at those muscles. Don't end up like me. Treat your neck well and do exercises to strengthen them!! 

In theory, you can. Stamina can be trained with any kind of muscles, as long as you are getting training is a very high volume (which implies a low intensity). Note that stamina consists of muscular endurance (which depends on the muscles that are trained), and cardiovascular endurance (which depends on the whole cardiovascular system) In practice though, most people probably won't develop as much stamina (in terms of muscular endurance) in their upper body as in their legs, because they simply get more volume in using their legs (unless they start walking on their hands all the time). That being said, if you want to improve cardiovascular endurance, you will probably get faster results with leg workouts, because your legs already have more muscular endurance which gives you the ability of higher volume training. 

Question: I feel this is a bit too much volume for one workout, I'm currently alternating between doing [1,2,4,5,7] and [1,3,4,6,7]. I wonder if this makes sense or if I rather should stick with one of them for a longer period of time (like 2 weeks or so) and then switch to the other one? Relevant details: I'm doing 2 mins rest between sets and 0-2 warm-up sets for each exercise, so one workout is about 1 hour. I'm doing that 3x/week. I also do some low intensity running (5km) 2x/week. I started training 7 months ago. Any other advice on my program is greatly appreciated!
