Hegel's dialectic method of interpreting history says that events occur in the following steps: a) an event happens b) an opposing event comes to contradict the original event c) a third event takes the first two and synthesis between the two. As far as I know, this is the general way in which Hegel looks at history. From there he goes to take a rather mystical approach to history, saying that through it the "world spirit" is "showing itself" (not sure about the exact phrasing he uses). Could we instead of going the more mystic path, interpret Hegel's history of philosophy as a way to look at life? For example, something like: an event happens to me, but then a worse event happens, but I should know that in the end a third event would happen that'd synthesis between the two (I'd must admit that's how I look at life most of the time). 

Teleology (the research of a phenomenon according to its "finality", its end-goal) is a subject that's often controversial (at least to my knowledge), and I'm not sure I've seen it in science (more specifically, natural science). Is there any teleological theories in (natural) science (more particularly, modern science)? If not, is there a fundamental rejection of teleological research? 

Is there any research (active or not) in such branch? What are the influences (past or possible ones) of such branch to the ontological branch? 

I'm reading Levinas' book "From God who comes to the idea" (a Google translate from "De Dieu qui vient à l'idée"), and in the chapter "questions and answers" (a Q&A Levinas had with Dutch philosophers) appears a line "the other appears in a pantomathic way". I've looked up the definition of pantomath - basically a person who wants to know everything - and I just don't see the relation. This line in the answer is related to the line in the question that stated that "when I read Finite and Infinity, it seems to me that the face of the other are as if they appear out of nowhere, what gives [Levinas'] philosophy a pantomathic characterism". [note - all quotes are a vague translation by me, I hope you understand.] 

I know two approaches for instinct - the neuroscientist one that says instinct is not something spontaneous, but rather dependent on life experience. And the mystical unconscious one that says instinct is a connection to the unconscious spirit of the world (19th century Germans, especially Hegel, Hartmann, Schopenhauer). I was wondering, what more approaches are there today, and which are the more popular ones? 

F. H. Jacobi (Wikipedia) argued in the late 18th century against Kant that any foundation of knowledge will inevitably lead to an infinite regression of justifications (thus any foundation of knowledge will eventually lead to nihilism). I know that many Neo-Kantians have tried (sometimes successfully) to "fix" this issue in Kant's philosophy (Kant himself tried in Opus Postumum). But I haven't heard of that in the 20th (and 21th) philosophy of metaphysics. So, was it just taken for granted after the Neo-Kantians' solutions? Was it ignored? Or was it discussed and I just haven't seen this discussion (and hopefully will get references if this is the correct option)? 

First of all, I'd state that there isn't a consensus on "one logic/mathematics", throughout history different versions of logic and mathematics were presented, but I will not go deeper on that as it wasn't really the question. Now for the question - most commonly when we talk about logic we are talking about Aristotle's categories for the logic basis - substance, quality, quantity, relation, place, date, posture, state, action, passion. Or another common logic categories - Kant's - 4 categories that split into 3 sub categories each: quantity- unity, plurality, totality. quality- reality, negation, limitation. relation- inherence and subsistence, causality and dependence, community. modality- possibility, existence, necessity. Both Aristotle and Kant came up with the Categories to conclude the limits within our knowledge can be. Without these categories, they wouldn't have been able to further their philosophy and build logical arguments - meaning, in another words, they practically couldn't "talk". Now, could have Aristotle or Kant create a different set of categories, hence practically changing their entire philosophy base? Technically, one could argue that the answer must be yes. But another can argue that these categories (as Kant's are practically a rearrangement and expansion of Aristotle's) are ultimately the "one true" set of categories, and we, epistemology-wise, can't have it any other way. Both statements might be true, and that might be ultimately dependent on your definition of logic - again, won't go deeper here because it isn't really the question. So, for conclusion, when one says "one logic" one ultimately states that we epistemology-wise have one set of rules that we think by, and we can't have it any other way. Is it really the truth? Do we actually have only one set of rules by which we think? Do we even have a set of rules? Is it static? Is it dynamic? Those are all valid questions that were asked and answered (and asked again, et cetra et cetra) throughout the entirety of philosophical thought. 

Ontology is one of the best known and most important branches of metaphysics - the study of "things", of "beings", or of "what there is" (in oppose to what "there isn't"). I have a few questions about the opposite of ontology: (0. Is there any meaning to ask questions outside of the ontological scope?) 

This question came to me after watching a nice debate between theist and atheist. In one of the atheist arguments, he ultimately based his atheism on the basis that we (should? It's not clear from his words) believe what is true, instead of what makes us feel good. I'd like to question that statement and ask (epistemologically or theologically) do we really believe what is true? I know that in classic epistemology the first stage for claiming something as true is the belief (you have to believe in something first, then you go through all the rest of the epistemological steps), so it seems that the statement should be at least reverted - what is true is something we believe in (which then render the statement as at best unrelated to the debate, but moreover - it makes the theism/atheism discussion completely biased via personal belief system). Going further, we can state that if what is true is something we believe in, we have no problem to claim that we can believe in something good, making the next statement to be: what is true is what we believe to be good. In other words we get the final statement - we can believe what is good, which may be claimed to be what is true. I know I may have done some illogical steps here, so correct me if I'm wrong. But the point is, I'm questioning the claim that we believe what is true, and even further (can be separated) I can claim that even what we consider to be true is considered via our belief system. [Note- I've considered mainly the epistemologically aspect of the question here, but the theological one would be much appreciated in the answers as well.] 

Schopenhauer obviously learns from the German Idealists tradition of assuming an unconscious force acting on the world (or "underneath" it), but Schopenhauer's take is that this force is a blind will, the World Will, that acts amorally, without any certain agenda. Schelling’s idea in the System of Transcendental Idealism is quite similar, but I'm not exactly sure if Schelling's Absolute is a blind one, as it strives to "know" itself. Maybe the its creations are created "blindly", but I'm not sure the force itself is exactly "blind" as Schopenhauer's pessimism view suggests. Any help with this? I'm thinking maybe it's the same idea, but Schopenhauer's pessimism is the defining separation between the both. Do note that I'm talking about the System of Transcendental Idealism in Schelling, not his later writings when he goes to the more spiritual theistic approach.
