As I understood Nagarjuna, a Being (Self) is neither the Skandhas, nor not the Skandhas; for a Being can't be obtained without the Skandhas. Then it can be said in our worldly wording that each amoeba is a Being though by binary fission; so is each Dolly an individual sheep. And life isn't created, for if it could we can assemble in lab.; even Frankentein needs that "lightening" to give it life. Therefore since life isn't created it can't be annihilated, just changes form of expression from each life-session. That's what called reincarnation, or better named rebirth. Reincarnation is specially for some Beings who are autonomous in it, or with mission. 

I'm running short of time however, I can't help trying to offer what I thought that's useful for you after reading your OP. I totally agree with you the world is crazy and many doings are meaningless. I myself a very artistic person this world is too rough for me. I also felt the same I'm out of the place/ don't fit in, people seem can easily living like fish in water but I have to learn how to live a human life, including how to interact with other humans, literally. A) Change happens and it happens beginning from the inside: 

It's not easy to give an explicit answer, the rather thorough one is here. An Arhat must be a Bhikkhu living a monastic life but a Bodhisattva is not necessary. The goal for the Arhat path aspires to conquer the afflictions of mind thus sever the cord of Samsara and dwell in Nirvana, the Bodhisattva path is in dealing with the afflictions acquired the wisdom (Bodhi) thus returned again and again to Samsara cultivating merits and wisdom by ferrying others from the sea of suffering, the Samsara. The Bodhisattva path has detailed grades of advancement, main categorization is from the 1st grade to the 10th: 

The heart of Mahayana Buddhism is to aspire to become the Buddha, for that the realization greatest potentiality of any sentient being, especially Human Being. To be a Buddha is to regain the totality of one's beingness without defilement (but of course there more profound teachings about defilement is not defiled for what originally perfect can never be scathed). As a Buddha, naturally he will aspire for the greatest benefit of all sentient beings, the greatest most wondrous existence is being a Buddha - so a Buddha will help all sentient beings to attain Buddha-hood. Buddha = compassion = selfless love, just generalization; the mind of the Buddha is beyond comprehension, it said. To produce a Buddha, the "everyone" (unenlightened beings) is the ingredient. Through helping others to attain liberation, a Buddha is born. Said in 《普賢行願品》 (The Aspiration of Bodhisattva Samantabhadra) that this whole is like the Bodhi tree, the leaves and branches the sentient beings, the root Prajna-paramita, the fruit the Buddha. Without any one part, that's not a tree any more. Help others attaining liberation from simply ridding illness (many real Buddhist practitioners possessed this healing power naturally), be their trustworthy friends, providing services, giving virtuous advice... to enlighten them, all go gradually or spontaneously. Like, if you real wealthy, that must be when you can give to anyone in need; you a kind person, that must be when you showing your kindness to others; you good doctor, when have cured a patient with terminal illness. Likewise a Buddha a Buddha is by helping sentient attaining enlightenment. There will always sentient beings be born into Samsara, for Samsara denoted cyclical recurring. Unless all sentient awake all at once in this Great Dream of Maya. Obviously from the beginning-less and endless of spatial/temporal dimension, this never happened, else we won't exist (are we the dream dreaming our existences or we dreaming the dream?? - Zhuang Zhou and his butterfly metaphor :). For the fact this never happened, I can surely infer it will never happen too, simply, Samsaric time is beginning-less and endless (I know many won't be able to understand at here - I will be misunderstood, again!!). So those who don't understand Mahayana will intercept here laden their lethal attack - liberation of all sentient beings a futile aspiration!! Yes, futile; but that almost ensured there will be plenty of unenlightened sentient to be liberated (solved the OP's intrigue ;). It ensures anyone aspired to be the Buddha will have plenty and more than enough ingredient to work on :). Further, a futile attempt doesn't diminish the one who held the greatest aspiration - in fact the glorious of such spirit. Isn't there a popular gig: Impossible = I'm possible :)? It could go on and on... to cut short and conclude, the enigmatic Mahayanists proclaim, 眾生無邊誓願度；(innumerable sentient I vow to ferry across) 煩惱無盡誓願斷；(endless fetters I vow to cut off) 法門無量誓願學；(countless Dharma gates I vow to study) 佛道無上誓願成。(unsurpassable Buddha Path I vow to accomplish) These original Chinese Mahayanists are likely, crazy. Yeah. 

But I think maybe you are interested to investigate a bit more... The intellectual questions are confined by intellectual limitation. Intellectual limitation of procuring question or answer is limited in these four types: 

There's only one characteristic - for truth, it's Selfless/Anatman (無我) action. All Karmas are doing (actions), all doings signify there the doers. When the doer has ceased, there's no doing, hence no Karma. It's not my invention :). It's what Nagarjuna said. Read his Madhyamaka in Chinese original if you could, not the Tibetan or Sanskrit translated English ones though. Almost all of those Eng. versions you could find are from Tib. or San. these scholars being taken thinking those more exotic or authentic; yet the truth is, they were back-translated from Chinese, of inaccuracy. The whole Sastra included "Blue Eyes" explanation by Kumarajiva is only 68 pages, full of witty remarks. The other way to help pondering Karmaless action is the Daoist: 無為 而無不為 -- Dao De Jing. More it's close to a Selfless action, lesser the Karmic implication. Until one realized Anatman, then all his doings are Karmaless doings. Too many people believing once they know the concept, learn the theory or argument, or read the Suttas of Anatta, etc., they have the privileges of having the Anatta. It's so unhealthy even fatal for their Dharma lives. It must be stressed, the proof of really realizing Anatman is one can disappear at will. Again, it's not my invention, it's described in the Sutras and Vinayas I read, such as, a Bhiksu disappeared right in front of the eyes of the visitors from the rock he sat to report to the Buddha then reappeared right at the same spot telling the Buddha was on his way from Grdhrakūta. 

From as far as I could contemplate after reading some of the sutras and articles, the "self" and "soul" are different. In Buddhism, "self" is the result of polluted "manas-vijñāna"; while soul is a pure hypothesis resulted from the intellect (a theorem, conjecture in some religious systems). As "self" is resulted from polluted "manas-vijñāna" the 7th vijñāna, it is real but it is not-true. Thus causes the karma and birth/death built upon this not-true "self", the polluted manas-vijñāna. Thus has the Buddhist teaching of not-self (anatta?) for end of suffering. However it is real since it produced effects. Like a dream is real when one is in the dream and all the dream scenes are with impacts, but a dream is not true when one awaken and realized (enlightenment). (眼識visual、耳識audio、鼻識nasal、舌識taste、身識touch（以上合稱五識these are the 5 vijñāna）、6.意識consciousness/intellect、7.末那識manas-vijñāna 及 8.阿賴耶識ādāna-vijñāna.) I got the inspiration from reading this: 

I think in Asian countries most likely, in occasions, like during Qhingming Festival, but many are cultural traditions, not Buddhist tradition. Monasteries may do this too - but for Hungry-shades, as part of their daily practice of sending merits and blessings to all the sentient beings. In Mahayana Monasteries, they usually also throw 7 grains to the courtyards for the Garudas. Because when the Garuda King converted to the Buddha and promised not to kill, however he mentioned there was a difficulty, for the karmic effect all Garudas must eat Nagas as food, or die. Thus the Buddha promised him from then and to the future his Bhikhus will feed them with the grains, so they wouldn't die even didn't eat Nagas. Just read about this story haven't been bother to find any Sutra/Sutta reference yet, but that's what the monasteries do. Would be interested to know if it also practiced by the Theravada monasteries :).
