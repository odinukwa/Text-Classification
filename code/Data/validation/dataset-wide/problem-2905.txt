On a temporary basis and as an ongoing personal philosophy selflessness is possible but a consistent selfless life is unsustainable. Selflessness perhaps seen "Universally" or collectively could be seen as good because collectivism inherently blanks-out the individual, but in an individual sense selflessness is bad. All values have to be produced by individuals, so altruism requires a sacrifice of time and effort. To see morality in regards to the daily and your long term goals, as individuals, sacrifice is bad. I do consider benevolence and altruism to be separate concepts. Philosophy qua individualism selflessness is bad. It can mean a few things: material selflessness (the giving of possessions), spiritual selflessness (giving up logic and thought; ie religion), and collectivist ethical doctrine towards the state. 

You say: Any argument for humans and other higher order beings having freewill would have to explain at which point in the evolution process does it appear. This is not a valid starting point: What is free will How do you define free-will? When there are two choices for an animal, and it chooses one path over another, is that the exercise of free will? If an animal has advanced methods of calculating the likely outcomes of each choice to independently take the options it feels most beneficial.. is that that definition of free-will? How is free-will measured? How can it be measured in our ancestors when it's impossible to directly observe them? Evolutionary justification The fact we have capacity for free will, the fact that other animals demonstrate a capacity for free will, that clearly shows these things evolved. What matters more for evolutionary thinkers, is understanding WHY we evolved to have free will. For example (hypothetical), if someone told 1000 people to jump off a cliff, but one person with the genes for free will chooses not to jump, that person gets to pass on their genes. Everyone else who jumped off a cliff will not pass on their genes. So the genes that carry free will survive and get passed on. This is an evolutionary explanation. Free will, which we'll define as the ability to recognise alternate options, calculate the most favourable outcome, and then select that favourable option, greatly increased the survivability of those individuals. That is how an evolutionary explanation works. Demonstrating which ancestor it developed, and how many millions of years it ago it arrived, has no bearing on the evolutionary validity of free will. 

I want to learn logic better, I know a few fallacies but I've read no books mostly just stuff on the Internet. I see them everywhere, but sometimes I don't know what the fallacy is called. I am a pretty decent logician, but I want to learn the terminology well. Where do I start? What books do you recommend? 

The first form of language is concept-formation from perceptions, the second is concept-exchange verbally. He cannot teach them, because they cannot understand his concepts as they have not formed them perceptually and consciously like he has. To quote my second favorite philosopher, Leonard Peikoff: 

Wow - timely. This topic is really trending lately. Ok, so rather than write an equation to prove black equals white and endanger myself at the next zebra crossing, I'd like to put forward a couple of logical arguments to highlight some gaps. 1. Where Infinite Regression is impossible In the research you mentioned above (ie. Aristotle) that the impossibility of infinite regression means that everything must have a beginning, and a prime mover must have been there to create that beginning. Yay prime mover. 2. Where Infinite Regression is possible However, there an equally logical argument that the possibility of an infinite regression is also the cause of a prime mover. What you can say is that the infinite regression sits in a bubble of time, and outside of this bubble of time sits a prime mover who is without time. Because the universe is subject to time, but there is a hypothetical non-time environment, you can simply have the two sit side by side. The prime mover who is without time doesn't need to have gone back to the infinitely old universe to kick thing off, but was just always there. Yay prime mover. Back to reality The human mind is so creative and flexible it can always find a way to justify or explain a prime mover. When arguing against a true believer, it's impossible to win because they will always fall back on 'but god must have created the big bang' type of argument. God as an explanation is like the ultimate set of wildcards - that's why you can't use facts to debunk it. However, a truly logical mind knows there is no such thing as a prime mover because ultimately the argument isn't about infinite regression, big bangs, physics, or maths.. but comes down to the most beautiful logical statement of all time.. Ockham's razor: If given the choice between: 

While reading the Wikipedia article on Karl Popper, I was surprised to find that one of the article's sources, in its lede paragraph, claims that Karl Popper was a "dedicated opponent of all forms of scepticism". Perhaps my understanding of scepticism is skewed. How should scepticism be understood in this context? And what philosophies of Popper demonstrate that he, indeed, was an opponent of (referred types of) scepticism? 

Strictly speaking I believe definitive knowledge is never obtainable, as Karl Popper has convincingly argued. Simply put; Karl Popper argued that there can always arise occasions where that, that which we hold to be confirmed knowledge (truth), will be falsified by a new observation. In other words; what we accept as being knowledge is actually merely belief with a certain degree of perceived certainty. I say perceived certainty, as Popper argued that it holds no actual certainty value at all; it can merely be perceived as propositions that have consecutively been corroborated by evidence. But as stated before: only one observation that contradicts such a proposition, believed to be knowledge, could be enough to falsify it. Therefor, I think we'd be wiser to classify different gradations of belief (and disbelief for that matter) on imaginary scales: 

Numbers on their own represent nothing, one always represents an entity, two and beyond are all groups of entities. It is a matter what entity the number represents. If that entity is for example millimeters then it is an objective unit of measurement, if that unit is some arbitrary mental unit it relates to nothing and the sum is nonsense. 

Obviously you are making assumptions from a small amount of information and know it. You need to read her original material, but no its not a blending, it is a unique philosophy. Nietchze still believed in sacrafice in reverse, sacrificing others to yourself. Ayn Rand in brief: Every value has to be produced. If you are not producing values, you are not rationally selfish. Therefore a thief is not selfish and a beggar is not selfish. Goods come from working. It doesn't support violating rights. It is influenced by the American founding fathers whom didn't express such a philosophy explicity. In Ayn Rand's opinion America failed because of this, because it didn't have its own philosophy and instead fell under the influence of European philosophy. Individual rights were forgotten, and the Constitution continually misunderstood. 

If you're referring to the legal concept, this holds because there are fundamental rights or expectations (in jurisprudence) that apply to people going through a legal process. For example, the right to be heard, the right to a fair trial, etc. These underlying 'rights' are there to ensure that the legal process can operate effectively and are termed natural justice. Unfortunately, it doesn't mean that a legal outcome will be fair and just. Instead it means that a person has been given a fair and reasonable opportunity to state their case, and that the adjudicator (judge, magistrate, or jury) has reasonably considered the evidence before them. If you're referring to either of the other types of natural justice, then I'm afraid I'd have to say no. I don't believe an ethical or moral compass for decency is a natural justice, and I don't believe that the universe (or diety/s) is presiding over our lives :P 

If it is objective evidence it certainly points toward ~P without objectively proving it - but providing a clue for further inductive investigation. After that, more evidence might be found. Incomplete evidence can still be key to evidence. 

To consider this objectively one must keep in mind when seeing the result of votes, on how they are created. Rationally one must consider that the votes on this site came from its rules, that is, because of them to get votes you have to get reputation and objectively it is just reputation. The system provides an objective valuation as far as the members are being objective. If the majority of the site are objective, the numbers are objective within their own definitions based on their causes: the rules. 

1) Belief despite the lack of corroborating evidence 2) Belief due to overwhelming corroborating evidence 3) Disbelief despite overwhelming corroborating evidence 4) Disbelief due to the lack of corroborating evidence Knowledge then, I think, should be considered that part of the first scale that leans towards the right end of the scale (rational belief), while keeping in mind that this knowledge is never definitive. edit: Perhaps this image, somewhat in line with your image, better demonstrates what I mean: 

Personally, I believe it's fair to assume nature/reality has no purpose. Quite often, people that, like myself, have some interest in natural sciences, agree that there are good reasons to believe nature/reality has no purpose. However, when asked whether they believe morals are therefor relative, quite often they seem to disagree. I've never really asked them how they want to defend that position though. But now, I just wanted to ask people who might recognize them selfs in said position (rejecting moral relativism while at the same time assuming no purpose in nature). How does one intellectually defend such a position? To be clear; I'm not talking about what is an emotionally desirable position to take, but rather the intellectually honest position to concede. I can totally understand that if one intellectually comes to the conclusion that morals are indeed relative, there may still be an emotional need to reject moral relativism and for instance prefer a utilitarian approach to ethics. However, is there an intellectually honest approach to construct moral axioms that are still ultimately logically defensible? I, for instance, haven't come up with any logically convincing manner to extrapolate judgment values (good, bad, nice, beautiful, ugly, etc.) from the logical values true or false. Are people that reject the idea that morals are relative, when conceding the large probability that nature/reality has no purpose, fooling them selfs intellectually?
