Juan de Fuca (the same guy from whom the straits around Vancouver Island / the Seattle area are named), had claimed to have found a Northwest Passage Sailors from the south had also found the Gulf of Baja California, and frankly its big - so big that it would have been real easy to say, 'Oh, that's Juan's strait' There was the romance novel Las sergas de Esplandián by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo, mentioned above. 

The modern country of Somalia is pretty much universally considered a failed state. Within Somalia itself, however, is the de facto state of Somaliland, which if I remember correctly is almost exactly coterminus with the former colony of British Somalia. The failed portions are almost entirely in the former Italian holdings. Making things even better, Somaliland was an independent state for a week before joining in federation with Italian Somalia Now, politically, I understand that the U.S. has certain allies in the region that would not like it to be an independent country, but I'm not clear on those geopolitics. Furthermore, its not like the U.S. is the only country that recognize other countries! What I'd like to understand is what these historical animosities are, and what the present geopolitical ramifications would be of recognition. In short, why don't most countries recognize Somaliland? 

Those who believe in the strict truth of the book of the Bible (I do not myself) would of course say it goes back to God's creation of the world, see Genesis Chapters 1 and 2 Most others say the week comes from Ancient Babylon, known directly from at least 500 BC but presumably older, if the Jewish religion absorbed it during the Captivity in Babylon which is thought to have ended 538 BC see: $URL$ More information in Gerard Clarke's book 'Heirs to Lost Kingdoms' The 7 day week's origins appear to be based on Babylonian Astrology, which knew 7 'planets' (i.e. wanderers in the sky, as opposed to the fixed constellations): Sun, Moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. Each was thought to 'rule' the first hour of hour of a day of the week. This made each day propitious for some activities but not for others, although there was not originally a Sabbath or a Weekend. Hence why several religions that later developed in the Middle East have one day of a 7 day week as their Holy Day, but possibly also why there is no consensus as to which day it is: Wednesday for Yazidis, Thursday for Druze, Friday for Muslims, Saturday for Jews, Sunday for Christians. [For some reason no religion seems to like Mondays!?] This took longer to spread to Europe. The 1st Century BC Roman writer and politician Cicero complained that the Jews were 'lazy' because they refused to work 1 day in 7. His contemporary the Roman general Pompey had an advantage attacking Jerusalem in 63 BC because the Roman besiegers worked 7 days a week to build up ramps from which to attack the city walls while the pious Jewish defenders would only work to knock them down 6 days a week and stopped for the Sabbath. 

As far as I know, most if not all rulers in Christian Europe "conceded that the Emperor was the universal lord of Christendom, but only in high office, not in deed" (taken from The Prince and the Law, 1200-1600, which speaks specifically about the King of France). Thus, most were just concerned with obtaining and securing liberties for themselves and their lands (in the case of Germany and Italy), or avoiding interference from the Emperor (as in the kingdoms outside Imperial lands – France, England, etc). Although the Emperor real power was limited, breaking from the Empire and denying the Emperor's lordship over the Christian community would have been quite daring; for example, the Italian cities became independent de facto but never, to my knowledge, declared any intention of breaking with the Empire. I think that didn't happen even after the Reformation: reformed rulers claimed that the Emperor had no right to force Catholicism into the lands they ruled, but didn't deny the Emperor's overlordship, however theoretical it was. Anyway, my knowledge is limited and I might be wrong, so let's see what other posters have to say. 

For a government acquiring property, neither situation applies, so there is no need to assign an actual value. So, again, it really boils down to "How much can we get for as little give as possible." 

There is also a simple geographic explanation to this issue. Mountains divide people, rivers bring them together. If you look at the most stable boundaries in the world, they are those that are along mountains. The Caucasuses are, of course, highly mountainous. For protection, for food, and for simple energy conservation, once a culture is established on a mountain, it's hard to move it. And, as different groups establish themselves on different mountains, they tend to differentiate. Simple time encourages mistaken kingdoms to be small and varied - and the Caucasuses, like most mountainous areas (the himalaya, the Appalachian, The Alps) tend to encourage lots of small micro cultures. 

Put them together, and you have an island. Given the resources at the time, and a surfeit of targets for exploration, it makes sense they would have said, 'This is an island, we'll get around to mapping it later.' That this was not an island was realized in 1744, when an overland expedition proved it be part of the mainland. 

Quartó (plural quartons) was the Catalan name of each of the four quarters the island was divided into after the conquest of Ibiza and Formentera by the Aragonese in 1235 (Catalan Wikipedia article about the quartons here). Interestingly enough, a couple of PDF documents (1 and 2) at the Institute of Ibicene Studies (Institut d'Estudis Eivissencs in Catalan) mention that according to official documents from the time of the flag's creation in 1979, its basis had been an alleged flag of the ancient University of Ibiza (no mention was made of why it had four castles). According to the said institute, there's no trace of any flag of the ancient University of Ibiza either, so in 2007 there was a proposal for changing the flag for another, more coherent one from a heraldic point of view, but was ultimately cancelled. 

I'd say Half-Uncial (3rd Century AD) and Carolingian (9th Century AD) scripts; as it says in the Wikipedia text for the latter, 

As a non-expert I would guess that: a) It is hard to study without much of written sources; one can tell if an inscription is in Greek, Latin or what but it must be much more conjectural whether an excavated group of huts was occupied by Thracian speakers or some other group. b) As Thracian and Illyrian were later replaced in most of the Balkans by Slavonic languages, most modern inhabitants of those areas feel less connection to (I say less connection to, I do not say none) and desire to preserve the memory of those cultures. (Albanian may be descended from Illyrian but Albania is a small, poor country with limited resources.) c) As far as I know, the Thracians and Illyrians mostly failed to burst into other nations' histories to compel attention in the way that say the Goths and Vandals did when they overran large parts of the Roman Empire. 

So, in researching the link from sbi, I think he's got one piece of the puzzle, but there seem to be a few more. 

You're over thinking this. In both cases, we wanted land, they wanted money. The discussion was a negotiation like any other - how much / how little money / land can we extract before the other party walks away? It's haggling, pure and simple. I doubt there was any analysis done at all, except "Can we afford this?" and "Does this seem like a good deal?" We're talking the 1800s here, not the same sophisticated real estate and finance regime we have now. I'm not saying the people in the 1800s were stupid by any stretch - I'm just saying, don't apply modern notions of finance and real estate to a gentle mans game of yore. Additionally, the valuation of real estate, even today is done for two reasons: 

I guess he could be anyone, but one who more or less fits is Edward IV of England – he was one of four brothers who survived into adulthood, was the fourth king by the name Edward, had four sons (including an illegitimate one), and his reign began on March 4, 1461. Maybe there's more trivia around about him matching the number 4. 

The inscription is in Italian or, perhaps more accurately, in the Tuscan dialect that became the basis of modern Italian. The inscription is written in an abbreviated form, which was usual in monumental inscriptions since at least Roman times and common in manuscripts and early printed books too — the missing letters are replaced, between brackets, when transcribing the text. 

EDIT- I'm adding extra information: The "Grand Turk" was the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud I, who died in December 1754 – his death was sudden, too, and the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica says he died from heart disease, so it's easy to infer he had a stroke; the ambassador was Roland Puchot, the mentioned (Count) des Alleurs,not Ailleurs as I wrote before (corrected that), who died in Constantinople in late 1754 or early 1755, of a stroke ("un attaque d'apoplexie" according to this source). So, if the sources and Voltaire are to be believed, Pancrace Royer has most probably died of a stroke. 

Shaving was hard before the invention of metal knives. I regret I do not now recall the name of the book but I read in one book about Ancient Egypt, which had pictures to prove it, that in very early times, I think before 3,000 BC, when pre-literate Ancient Egyptians scratched or coloured pictures, as they sometimes did, they showed their men, who were not naturally as hairy as other races, with unimpressive small beards, which are probably all that grew naturally for them. From the Bronze Age, which roughly coincided with the appearance of literacy, Egyptian men were portrayed clean shaven. Men of some foreign nations, often also distinguished by their style of dress and other features, may be shown with beards, sometimes probably to conform to a stereotype to identify the picture as being of a Syrian or whatever. It seems the Ancient Egyptians therefore adopted shaving around 5,000 years ago, almost as soon as it was easily possible once they had sharp enough metal implements. Thereafter, they stayed clean-shaven pretty well as long as their civilization lasted, so for the next 3 thousand years. That would be remarkable for other societies but less so for the Ancient Egyptians, who once they found a style that suited them tended to stay with it for an amazingly long time. A sketch survives from Deir el-Medina, the village of the workers on the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings in the New Kingdom (c 1550 - 1080 BC), probably made by one of the workmen in his spare time, of a man wearing the an Egyptian Royal Crown, looking slightly overdue for a shave, with bristles ('five O'clock shadow' we may now call it) showing on his chin and cheeks. In other words one of the workmen was probably being slightly naughty in showing the King caught not looking at his best, and differently from the formal and invariably respectful portraits that the painters and sculptors of the Royal tombs had to produce in their day-jobs. 

And the cited Dictionary by Bescherelle indeed says, but without citing any higher authority, that "by the way, the Ethiopic historian Marcellus spoke about Atlantis before the Greek philosopher." 

The coat-of-arms is that of the Austrian state of Lower Austria; another source says that "the arms were officially granted in 1920" (the mural crown is usually employed by republics to replace monarchic crowns), placing it sometime between that date and 1938. EDIT: Here's someone selling that same badge and dating it as "Second Austrian Republic", that is, anytime since 1945. 

Marcellus is still not identified, and his work is lost. According to a footnote in a 2006 Cambridge edition of Proclus' Commentary on Plato's Timaeus, 

One example that comes to my mind is the War of the Triple Alliance, perhaps more commonly known as the Paraguayan War, which was won by the said Triple Alliance (Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay). EDIT – But to be honest, I don't actually know nor could I find out whether it was called like that while it was being fought; it's pretty probable that it was called either "Paraguayan War" by the Allies and "War against the Triple Alliance" by the Paraguayans at the time. 

In the Napoleonic Wars the other major powers of Continental Europe, especially Austria but also Prussia and Russia, seemed to keep coming back every few years to have another go at fighting Napoleon, no matter how many times he had beaten them before. Why? Could they not see after he had won his first few battles how hard he was to beat? I leave the period from 1813 out of this question as it is more understandable that countries would dare to oppose him once the exceptional cold of the Russian winter and the vastness of the country had helped the Russians to destroy Napoleon’s immense invading army. I have also confined this question to the Continental European powers, as Britain protected by the sea and its Navy, could more safely defy Napoleon. 

There are usually some people who get a feeling of superiority from taking the cynical line, so in this case someone may well say "Of course all the talk of justice, patriotism, standing up to aggressors etc. was phony, it was really all about control of Antarctica's untapped oil reserves." However, while that might be about 1% of it so far as the UK and Argentine governments were concerned, I doubt it was important as: -Wikipedia will confirm that the argument over the Falklands goes back to the eighteenth century. Britain. Spain and France all had claims to them, which Spain asserted by force in the 1770s and Britain reversed, again by force, in the 1830s. Thereafter Spain's successor Argentina kept up a theoretical claim but probably did not dare to start a war over them while Britain was a much the stronger world power in the Nineteenth and early to mid Twentieth Century. For most of this period no one knew or cared whether there was oil or other minerals buried inaccessibly under Antartica. The argument was genuinely about the islands themselves. -In the 34 years since the Falklands War neither Britain nor Argentina has seriously attempted to exploit its Antarctic territory commercially, suggesting that any hope of being able to do so was a very remote one and hardly worth the risk of a war on either side. It proved a disastrous gamble to the then military Junta ruling Argentina, who brought about their own disgrace and downfall by starting and then losing the war. I was later told by someone in our Ministry of Defence that at the beginning they did not really think Britain could succeed in recapturing the islands, yet the Thatcher government took the risk, knowing it must be their political ruin if they lost. Surely neither government would have gambled their existence over the very distant prospect of possibly one day being able to get something of value out of Antarctica. -I am British and was aged 18 or 19 at the time Argentina invaded with very little warning and temporarily seized the Falklands by surprise. Most people subsequently followed the news of the dispatch of a British naval and military task force to the South Atlantic and their eventual victory. The War did divide people, but most in Britain who I spoke to who supported the war did so because they saw it as standing up to aggression and/or hurt national pride. I remember trying to explain to a puzzled New Zealander why we had fought for remote islands that previously most people in Britain had scarcely known existed. I said he would probably understand why many of us were angry at the surprise Argentinian invasion if he ever woke up to learn that a foreign country had seized by force some equally obscure islands far out in the Pacific over which New Zealand claimed sovereignty. Whereas the people I encountered in Britain who opposed fighting to recover the Falklands seemed to be of two types: the type of committed 'leftie' to whom their own country is automatically always in the wrong, plus at least some of those old enough to have lived through the World Wars and remember what is was like when their own family or families they knew lost people killed. What I do not remember is anyone caring much about the Antarctic territories.
