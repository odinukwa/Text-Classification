Planets far outside the habitable zone can indeed have liquid water and therefore the possibility of life (like our own). The key thing the planet needs is a thermal "blanket" to hold in heat. One possibility is a layer of ice, as on Europa, which would need to be at least a few km thick. Alternately, an atmosphere of at least 10 bars of hydrogen can do the trick. It's entirely plausible that life-bearing conditions could be maintained even in the extreme case of planets with no stars! These free-floating planets are likely to be extremely abundant in the Galaxy. The only possible sources of heat on these planets are 1) leftover heat from formation, 2) radioactive decay of long-lived isotopes like Uranium, and 3) in some lucky cases, tidal heat from interactions with another planet (in the case of a free-floating pair of bodies, like a Jupiter with an Earth-like moon or two Earths orbiting each other). See here for details: $URL$ $URL$ Of course, this is what such a planet would look like (from up close): 

Four planets with the Earth-Venus ratio, starting at Earth's distance, puts the outermost one at about 2.7 AU. With a slightly closer spacing (say, 1.3 in separation), the fourth planet would be at 2.2 AU. This is close to the edge of the "traditional" habitable zone -- if the planet has a modestly-thick atmosphere of something like CO2 or even H2 then it can retain liquid water on its surface. Fourth -- I did a series of blog posts a while back explaining how to choose stars, planets, and orbits when building a planetary system. It's summarized here (with links to the different posts): $URL$ Finally -- just to counter any criticisms on these points, I am an astrophysicist working on exactly this type of question (specifically, on planet formation and orbital dynamics). 

A simple way to think about this problem is simply in terms of which planetary orbits are stable in a given binary star system. 

This sounds plausible to me. Large moons are sometimes formed in hydrodynamical simulations of giant impacts between protoplanets in the late stages of planet formation. The hardest part to buy is the density. Mercury has a lot more iron than Earth but its density is about the same because, with less gravity it is less compressed. We also don't know of any exoplanets with densities that indicate a much more iron-rich composition than Earth (although they are very hard to measure). 

This configuration is generally stable. You can add a couple more planets in by making each of them a binary planet, with two Earths orbiting each other. (see here: $URL$ and here: $URL$ With two planets orbiting in a co-orbital setup separated by 60 degrees, their rotation rates are not affected by the other planet. But, in the case of a binary planet, tides are likely to be strong enough to make the two planets tidally locked, so they always show each other the same face. In that case, both planets will have the same day, whose length is simply the time it takes the planets to orbit each other. Two planets could also be in a horseshoe configuration, which can be stable but can only fit two planets, not three. There are some other exotic classes of orbits that come close to satisfying your criteria (e.g., quasi-satellites and eccentric 1:1 resonant orbits). 

You could put both planets in the habitable zone on horseshoe orbits. Janus and Epimetheus orbit Saturn on this type of orbit. From the point of view of one moon, the other follows a horseshoe shape around Saturn (or the star in your case). Most of the time they are relatively far away, but once every cycle the two planets come pretty close to each other and have a gravitational encounter -- close enough to have a pretty giant object in the sky for a short time. One planet's orbit gets a little closer to the star and the other's gets a little farther. Here is what it looks like for Janus and Epimetheus, from a frame of reference orbiting Saturn. (Keep in mind that they are both orbiting Saturn far faster than they make horseshoes) 

In some cases planets can bounce between the stars of a binary (see here for an animation: $URL$ and here for an article about the phenomenon: $URL$ A bouncing planet would not orbit one star or another but rather could bounce back and forth between the two (at least for millions of years, although I'm not sure if it's sustainable for billions of years). Here is an example trajectory of a planet bouncing between two stars. 

You can have a planet as hot as you want. The key parameter you can play with is the orbital distance. There are planets known that are almost touching their stars. Wasp-12b is a gas giant planet that may be in the process of being tidally shredded by its host star ($URL$ It orbits its star once every 1.1 days. But there are far more extreme terrestrial examples. Kepler-78b is Earth-like in its size and bulk density but has an 8.5 hour day (see here: $URL$ The shortest day of any known planet (that I'm aware of) is about 4 hours. That close to the star, a planet's spin is likely to be tidally locked to its star, and the surface temperature may be hotter than the melting point of rock (~1500 Kelvin). That said, the temperature on the night side (which always points away from the star) may not be too too high, as long as the atmosphere is thin. Here are a couple of articles discussing this type of planet that is tidally locked to its star. Hope this helps $URL$ $URL$ 

I would think that the only thing that really matters is the orbital separation between the two components of the binary. That will set the orbital period of the binary-planet system. Since the planets are each tidally locked, their spin periods are the same as their orbital period. My understanding is that the Coriolis forcing on a planet's atmosphere is governed mainly by the spin rate. Fast spinning planets like Jupiter have a lot of convective (Hadley) cells between the equator and poles and so have a banded structure. Slow-spinning planets have fewer Hadley cells. Very slow-spinning planets would only have one. Having fewer Hadley cells should (I think) homogenize the temperature across the planet because the poles and equator would be in closer thermal contact. I would expect the following correlation: Distant binary orbit -> long orbital period -> slow-spinning planets -> more uniform latitudinal temperature distribution across planet Another thing to consider is that the binary planet is (I presume) orbiting a star, which means that the length of each planet's day is also the same as its spin period. And the energy deposited by the star is surely much much larger than the energy deposited by the other planet (by tides I would expect). So, I think the biggest factor of the other planet is simply in determining the spin rate. Tides must also play a role to some degree but that is likely to be on longer timescales, e.g. by making the planets move apart from each other. And if the planets themselves orbit relatively close to the star then star-planet-planet tidal effects would make this even more complicated. 

Finally, it's worth noting that a planet's obliquity can oscillate in time (and its orbital eccentricity too). This will have a strong effect on modulating the climate (perhaps in extreme ways). See here: $URL$ 

We can imagine a range of planets orbiting in physically-plausible, stable systems with many stars. Here are two examples that might interest you: $URL$ $URL$ 

I think it is totally plausible for there to be planets with a single kind of terrain. For this to happen, the whole surface of the planet must be at roughly the same temperature (unless you're talking about a desert planet and allow different types of desert). This doesn't happen on Earth: the poles are much colder than the equator. The situation is even worse on Mars, in terms of the temperature differential between the poles and equator. On Venus the entire surface is indeed at about the same temperature. This is because Venus' thick atmosphere and strong winds are so efficient at redistributing heat across the planet's entire surface that any temperature differences are smoothed out. Like Venus, I think a planet with habitable conditions could have a relatively uniform surface temperature. With a thick enough atmosphere the surface temperature would be relatively homogeneous (in detail, this also depends on things like the atmospheric composition and spin rate). I don't see why you couldn't have a planet like Dagobah, with a thick atmosphere that maintains jungle-like temperatures across the whole planet. Or a water world that is a global ocean with similar temperatures. Since a thick atmosphere often has a significant greenhouse effect, a planet with a uniform surface temperature would likely be relatively far from its star, in the outer parts of the habitable zone. In the most extreme case you could imagine a free-floating planet with no star. It's plausible that such planets could have life, either under a thick hydrogen atmosphere or in an ocean under a thick layer of ice (see here: $URL$ or here: $URL$
