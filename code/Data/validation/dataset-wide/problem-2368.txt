Your concern for keeping the fish alive longer than necessary is valid. I used to like to club fish to kill them immediately. However I now typically bleed by cutting the gills as you describe. This kills the fish rather quickly if done properly. It also offers other benefits which may or may not be important in any given situation. First, it helps diminish the amount of blood getting on the flesh when fileting. Despite years of semi-regular practice, I still often nick an artery along the spine when fileting larger fish (like Striped Bass or Bluefish). This invariably bleeds all over that filet, and can be difficult to rinse off. Bleeding first vastly reduces the amount of blood that is released when this happens. Second, for some species it really does mean the difference between a nice palatable dinner and a super-fishy tasting/smelling meal. The difference is most pronounced in oily fish like mackerel and bluefish. There is also a long tradition around here of bleeding sharks that are headed to the dinner table to help remove uric acid (I believe) and other substances that would foul the meat. 

Cleaning a flyline can help mitigate some of these effects, but it is very difficult to dry out the core once it is wet. 

That looks to be what is known as a flat "Scandi" grind on the edge. There are a lot of good resources online about how to sharpen this type of grind, but basically this is considered a relatively sturdy grind and simple to sharpen because there is no secondary bevel. The angle of that "edge" is your sharpening angle. Regarding the grit, that will depend upon the degree to which your blade is "dull," but 800 would be appropriate for general touch-ups on a well maintained blade. 

Your rod will take longer to unload and shoot the line under these conditions, giving the line more time to fall. Since the extra line weight will cause your rod to behave as if it has a "slower action," you will need to slow down a bit and open your cast as well as cast higher on back cast. The magnitude of the effect will depend on the he rods listed action (slow, medium, fast) and the difference in line weight. 

Your choice of an ugly stick is fantastic. I fish more specialized rods now, but I have owned many ugly sticks over the years, and they are rock solid performers. For the "small-water" fishing destinations and the species you say you'll be targeting, I would go for something in the 5-7' range - in a light rod power (to use Shakespeare parlance). Moderate to moderate fast action. As you are a novice, I'd recommend using a heavier line weight than you might use after you have more experience - 10-12 lb test braided line. It has the diameter of something like a 4-6 lb monofilament, but greater strength, sensitivity, and performance overall. Look for a spinning reel that will hold 120 yards or so of 6 lb monofilament and it will hold much more briaded line. I believe Shakespeare offers combos that would probably be perfect. Just make sure that whatever you buy is rated for saltwater The heavier line will definitely limit how far you can cast very light (<1/4 oz.) lures and rigs, but I think you'll lose fewer fish than if you were using 6lb test line. With a rig like this you could fish for bluegills or crappie one day, and then fight nice sized stripers the next. And catfish should be no problem. 

It would be good to know if you are certain that there actually ARE fish bigger than the palm of your hand in the area. But let's assume that there are. Whenever I come across suspicious fish that won't bite anything, I try two different tactics. The first and almost always the best is to use live bait - fish, not worms - of some sort. If you see schools of minnows or mullet or something, catch a few. Then hook one on a relatively small hook with no weight or anything else. Lob that near some structure and let it swim about. The hook and the injury will make the fish stand out even if it manages to get back into a school of other bait fish. Predators will zero in on it immediately. The method of hooking can differ depending on the species of bait, but I typically go for something behind the dorsal fin. I've also seen them hooked through a lip. If I can't get live bait, I'll go "small" with a lure - especially around docks that get a lot of fishing pressure. Big fish (30" striped bass, fore example) will often cruise around docks in the Northeast, but will rarely take much notice of a lure. BUT if I take a small 2-3" clear rubber minnow, throw it on a small belly/worm hook, and toss it in front of one of these, these same fish will often move in and suck it up nonchalantly. Big fun. 

I assume you are asking about striped bass. Although I have never fished for stripers (or rockfish, depending on where you are) on the Pacific side of the USA, this is the species that surf anglers in the Northeast target most passionately. Many of the best places to find them are those with strong currents and places to hide in ambush. These conditions often require fairly heavy lures, and the bucktail jig rigged with pork rind is typically what anglers use to get down to where the fish are. The weight you need will depend on the depth of the water and strength of the current - and you'll have to play around a bit (and probably lose a few to snags) to figure out exactly what you need. But you want enough weight so that a steady slow retrieve keeps the bucktail 1.5 - 2 feet above the bottom A good way to start would be to use a 2 oz. bucktail with a 6" or so pork rind. I favor red/white, but local anglers would know what works best. Cast the lure and let it sink until it hits bottom (you may get a strike on the descent.) Start cranking steady and relatively slowly - imagine a non startled fish swimming along lazily. After you have the lure moving well, stop cranking and count how long it takes to hit the bottom again. You want it to be 2-3 seconds or so. If it takes longer, it is running too high and you need more weight. Less time and it's too high and you need less weight. This is the bare bones basics, but it should get you started. John Skinner is a local author and accomplished angler. His videos are worth watching - and his books worth buying. Here's on on fishing bucktails On the south shore of Long Island we also use small diamond jigs with rubber tube tails. This might be more in line with what you are thinking, but we really only use these when the bass are focusing on sand-eels in the surf. And we use small ones - too small to be of much use in deep fast moving water. With both of these lures, the most common way to rig them is to tie a 5-6' length of 20 - 40 lb test fluorocarbon leader to your main line. And then tie the jig directly to the leader. No swivels or snaps. The fluorocarbon, while tough, will not stand up to much Bluefish action, so you'll need to switch to wire leader if they're around. 

Texas has a coast-wide, year-round speckled trout fishery. But Speckled trout fishing is hot in May and June and from October through January. 

Fly lines have special coatings that help you cast and manage the line on/in the water. Under ideal conditions you would use an older line for practice on the land because repeated contact with the ground, vegetation, sticks, etc. will damage your line: 

You CAN use the fluorocarbon for tippet. In fact many high quality tippets ARE made of fluorocarbon. What you get by buying the smaller roll of tippet is portability and the ability to conveniently carry several different sizes. When fly fishing you will need to adjust your tippet according to the size/type of fly you are using and to how leader shy the fish are. A heavier/bulkier fly will require heavier tippet just to permit a well controlled delivery. If you are throwing very small dry flies you might need 7x or smaller tippet to reduce the line's effect on the fly as it floats in the water or to minimize the chance of spooking a trout. In a given outing I regularly change my tippet (at the end of my leader) 3-4 times. Sometimes I'll increase the leader length by adding a bit of 4x, and then tying on 5x, and then some 6x - the idea is to drop down sizes as you go so that each subsequent section requires less energy to turn over - giving a smoother delivery. Carrying large rolls of fluorocarbon isn't practical on the stream or bay. Also you may not be able to find large rolls of very fine tippet. 

I assume you are considering a new reel with multiple spools. The reel's performance will not be affected except that with a lighter line you will be able to fit more backing. In a 5wt setup that usually wouldn't offer any benefit. One potential issue with using a much larger reel is the balance. You may be able to cast well with a poorly balanced setup, but it will get very tiresome over a long day. 

I fish for everything from 9" brook trout to 15 lb. bluefish to 40 lb. striped bass on both fly rod and spinning tackle, and honestly I don't think I would say that one is better than the other except for the fact that with 1 piece rods you don't worry about losing your tip, OR that with multi-piece rods you can cart them around more easily (and reduce the risk of slamming the tip in a door or something.) Nowadays the difference between the two is getting almost too little to talk about. Some will argue that a 1-piece is more sensitive, casts better, and is stronger. One thing for sure is that a 1-piece will never separate when casting or fighting fish - something that happens more than you would think due to people not checking the connection in their two piece rods. That said, most fly rods are multi-sectional. Since they depend on their flex to fight fish and their strength to cast line, it could be argued that having multiple sections is a non-issue. Modern ferrules and lines do a great job preserving sensitivity. I believe that only Lamiglas is making 1-piece surf casting rods larger than 10'. From what my tackle shop says, a change in shipping rates made it too costly to ship anything longer. So everyone else is making two piece rods for anything longer than 10'. I have both one piece and two piece. I mostly fish a 1-piece simply for the fact that I never have to pack them and I won't have to worry about the tip flying off after a cast. BUT, if packing size plays any part in the decision, I don't hesitate to take a multi-piece rod.
