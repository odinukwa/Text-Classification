In Polish, most (if not all) words containing letter ⟨h⟩ are actually loanwords as there was no [h]/[ɦ] sound in Polish (as opposed to Czech, Slovak and Ukrainian, where [ɦ] evolved from Slavic [g]). As the voiced [ɦ] is a pretty rare sound, most languages including Latin used unvoiced [h], which was quite naturally adopted into Polish as [x], with which it is typically completely homophonous (AFAIK the Polish kids have to learn the differences in written Polish at school and confusing ⟨h⟩ and ⟨ch⟩ is a fairly common mistake in Polish). Of course the [x] is an obstruent (belongs to the class of consonants whose main constituent is noise), so it undergoes voicing if followed by another voiced obstruent, and in these situations it is pronounced [ɣ] (if you are after correct pronunciation, you probably do not need to be overly concerned about this though because it will come quite naturally). I have no knowledge of Polish dialects but it is entirely possible that somewhere the [x] sound might be drifting towards unvoiced [h] (again for both ⟨h⟩ and ⟨ch⟩ as graphical representations) and there may be even regions where ⟨g⟩ is pronounced like [ɣ] or even [ɦ], so some small confusion may arise in positions where voicing is neutered (i.e. before an obstruent or at the end of the speech clause, because Polish obstruents lose their voicing at the end of the speech clause). 

Typically there is only so much in the way grammar systems tend to simplify on their own and this usually does not lead into complete loss of entire categories on such a grand scale (typically there are only some regularisations by analogies etc.). The reason why English lost most of its inflection actually has very little to do with grammar at all - it is caused by sound change. English heavily reduced all non-accented syllables, which, given the IE inflection being based on suffixes and endings, resulted in mergers and loss of most of these endings. Note that when the inflection is stressed, it is typically also preserved, i.e. the shortest words like the various forms of verb to be or the pronouns. The same process happened in French - all post-accentual vowels were eventually reduced and original word-end consonants followed the same fate. Again, given the way IE endings look like, this was not a particularly healthy environment and thus French lost all its declension and eventually large part of conjugations (until it developed its own based on alteration of stem vowels and consonants). Given the specific requirements to create new inflection, there is indeed a sort of a "trend" to lose inflection (given how unbelievably complex the PIE language was), however new inflections still arise, e.g. the Romance languages evolved a new synthetic future tense, Polish turned the Slavic analytical past tense into synthetic one, French can be considered developing prefix-based conjugation (but most traditional looks into analysing the language are not yet ready to accept it). 

I would highlight Wittgenstein's idea of family resemblances, which served as a basis for a very productive field in semantics (specificaly prototype theory). This basically postulates that words and their meanings do not work in binary categories but are organised in a field-like manner, where at the centre of the semantic field you have the prototypes (the most typical exemplars of something) while towards the edges, you have the less clear exemplars. E.g.: semantic field of furniture - table is a prototypical example of furniture, a lamp is a solid one too, a TV is not a superb one but still passable, computer not so much, alarm clock is a bad example of furniture, etc. This goes very far and basically gets rid of almost any defining features that would trivialise the category to a binary choice - e.g. "adoptive mother" is still a kind of a "mother", much more so than for example a "vacuum cleaner" even though the term specifically denies the biological relationship in the family. 

b) In European languages, the usage of reflexive pronouns can have other meanings as well. Another such meaning is reciprocity: 

My guess would be that it has something to do with rhythm. When you have a couple or a triplet of words on the same level ("X and Y" or "X, Y and Z"), there is a tendency in Indo-European languages to put in the longest of the two/three at the end (this is actually very well attested in poetry). The 10s numerals tend to be longer (as they are originally compound words or even univerbised phrases) than numbers from 1-10, this could lead to the words being switched if they are perceived to be on the same level somehow and not one dependent on the other ("40 and 5" and not "40 being the H and 5 being the D"). 

Many IE languages still preserve some remains of declensions of the most basic numerals like one,two or three (e.g. in Romance languages, they still distinguish gender if not case itself). 

Suffixoids and prefixoids are words typically referring to some middle stage of grammaticalisation, i.e. when we do not consider the element a stand-alone word but it is not comparable yet to regular derivational morphemes. This seems like a pretty apt analysis of both -like and -man in the examples above. For -like, this is something that has actually already happened in Germanic languages in the past and it is the source of the adverbial suffix -ly/-lich/-lik etc. You can argue that -like serves as a derivational suffix because you can convert it further, e.g. to abstract noun (catlikeness - I supposed this would not work as a derivation from a compound word... cat+likeness). For -man, you can actually even see that this form has been reduced phonetically - it lost accent and the mid-vowel changed to schwa. This is arguably being deconstructed lately by gender-conscious language as many people replace this element by -woman or -person. 

It is genetic. Prepositions in Indo-European languages come from adverb-like particles which themselves often come from some sort of noun in a specific case. This adverb could be mostly anywhere in the sentence given the relatively free word order of PIE. In English, many of these adverbs never fully transitioned into pure prepositions as they can stand on their own: 

I guess visuo-chromatic (or perhaps visuo-pigmental) would be the proper term. You can mostly hear about audio-oral languages or forms of communication, occasionally also about visuo-gestural ones (sign languages) or even tactile ones (sign languages for deaf-blind people). 

The language similarity (typically stemming from common origin) is a huge factor. As you pointed out, the first tier of languages is exclusively Romance and Germanic. English is originally a Germanic language which at certain points acquired a huge number of vocabulary of ultimately Latin origin. Thus it is similar in structure or in vocabulary to the languages in the first tier. Furthermore the languages are spoken in Western Europe (at least originally - Afrikaans comes from Dutch), so not only are they similar intra-lingually, but also they tend to capture the similar extra-lingual realities, which due to the long-term contact between the nations, they tend to do in a similar way. Second tier contains some Slavic languages, which have very unrestrictive phonotactics of consonants and complex inflection of both verbs and nouns. So they are more difficult for English speaker to learn. My native language is Czech, so it is comparably easier to me to learn Russian or Serbian than to an English person (but it is still quite simple to learn English). There are even some comparably complex languages that a Czech person does not have to learn to understand, like Slovak (which is mutually understandable) and Polish (here you need to strive a little but you do not "learn" the language as much as you are "getting used to it"). Third tier is languages with different origin and wildly different grammar, also with little shared contact and many different realities. So they would be presumably equally difficult to learn for me as a Czech speaker as they would be for American English speaker. Also it is necessary to define a little what it means to learn a language. IMHO for the utterly pragmatic purposes, the most important thing is understanding as it is the most demanding part of communication (if you express yourself incorrectly, the native speaker is still likely to understand a lot by inferring). And the more similar the language, the easier the understanding - getting back to Czech and Slovak: most Czech people would be unable to speak Slovak, but practically all of them understand it without effort or learning on their part. I imagine the similar goes for e.g. Portuguese and Spanish - due to the similarities it is easy for you to understand and then when you speak, however bad, the natives will most likely get the meaning somehow. 

Syllable is defined typically by its head or apex (i.e. usually some vowel) and for languages with permissive phonotactics (like most Indo-European languages), you will find it easy to count the syllables but quite difficult to find their exact boundaries. E.g. Czech word "sestra" (sister) can be syllabified as "se-stra", "ses-tra" "sest-ra". The middle option seems most natural to me but the other two do not form any forbidden consonant clusters either. All in all, it is a matter of potentiality and if you do a research among the speakers, their leaning will be probably something like 15/50/35 (i.e. with some more or less clear majority, but nothing like 3/90/7, which would be just deviations). Another difficulty is posed by strong morphological boundaries (e.g. prefixes) that can be perceived even by otherwise language unconscious speakers and shift their perception of syllable even further. Personally, I would not trust poetry in the least as the rules postulated by the poets are likely to be based on their arbitrary notions of esthetics or reasons. 

I understand that Korean is the prime example of this. South Korean is more open to loanwords, particularly from English, while North Korean was subject to changes stemming from the Juche ideology. 

Latin is full of these: Illum meum amicum appelo. (I call him my friend) Romulum regem romanum fecerun. (They made Romulus into a king) This is with verbs of change (somebody changed/made into something), verbs of appelation (somebody being called something but also nominated to be something, similarly to the previous example) and verbs of considering/belief (somebody considered to be something). 

No, e.g. in Czech, the past tense is expressed by the copula verb "být" (to be) and the past participle of the main verb. It is the main verb that expresses the aspect (perfective/imperfective). 

As indicated by Anschel Schaffer-Cohen, certain changes in Romance languages can be considered as gaining new inflections. Spanish is a very nice example but Portuguese is even better because there is actually some phonetic merger that makes the words even more difficult to separate: fazer+os = fazê-los (to do them) In French, where the structure of a phrase is quite rigid, you can separate the subject and the verb basically only by grammatical morphemes and from a certain perspective, the subject pronoun can be considered a conjugational prefix of a verb and considering it a separate word is just a matter of linguistic/orthographic tradition (it is separated with a space). Of course there are counter arguments, e.g. in 3rd person, the pronoun may be replaced by a noun, so it is not strictly obligatory, but still you have phrases like "Éric, il travaille", where the noun is highlighted and thus the pronoun needs to be present. In certain pidgins of French, this evolution actually goes further - in French there is a phenomenon called liaison, basically a consonant that used to be pronounced at the end of the word and disappeared is still preserved and resurfaces in certain contest (ils parlent /il parl/ - they talk vs ils aiment /il zem/ - they love), and the pidgins reinterpreted the resurfacing /z/ phoneme is an initial marker of plural (qui s-aiment ils? /ki zem il/ - who do they like?) and you can find this tendency emerging in spoken French too. 

It is basically pretty similar thing to English present perfect, i.e. the auxiliary verb have + some sort of past or passive participle of a content verb to express some sort of past. But in many non-Western European languages, this has been just an emerging feature with stronger influences here and there (I believe this is something present in these languages for a few centuries but it may be reinforced by further contaminations from the many Western languages that have this construction). Normally, Lithuanian has just a synthetic past and Slavic languages form the past with auxiliary verb be + past participle. Thus, this relatively new construction is called "possessive perfect" since it uses the verb have, which has not served as an auxiliary until now. Funny thing is that this construction also appears in Russian which is known for its lack of the possessive verb, so accordingly the possessive past uses their periphrastic possession у меня (есть) + passive participle. In my experience (mainly based on Czech), the function of this is restricted to accomplishedness (which is something slightly different than perfectivity in Slavic languages) and sometimes announcing of new recent past event. In Czech, the verb have is also combinable with other adjectives indicating accomplishedness, e.g. hotový (done, finished) even though they are not verbal participles. EDIT: Cursory search on the internet shows a nice study of this construction developping in Baltic and North Russian area: Seržant, I. The so-called possessive perfect in North Russian and the Circum-Baltic area. A diachronic and areal account 

Numerals were declined in Proto-indoeuropean heavily. The declensions are preserved very well in Sanskrit and to a certain measure in Ancient Greek as well as most contemporary Slavic languages or Lithuanian. e.g. numeral "five" in Sanskrit, Czech and Lithuanian 

So basically, I believe it is safe to say that it is mostly due to chance that in Germanic languages the grammaticalisation went more slowly (to the of not being finished in English) than in other IE languages. 

From a language user's point of view, I would say you can extend it frequently also to the first and second person plural. 

I certainly cannot imagine using the reflexive svůj in the case 4). However it is necessary to mention that the usage of the reflexive in the first/second person plural tends to get somewhat blurry in the last years and one can see the reflexive pronoun falling somewhat out of use even in case of a very clear co-reference (my personal suspicion is that this is an influence of advertising where they typically want to highlight you as the customer and your choices, which the reflexive pronoun does not really do). Addendum: Also it surprises me that you would not permit *We(i) took our(j) bags. in English. I admit that without any pragmatic context, my preferred reading of We took our bags would be that with co-reference, however in a context of, say, a group of tourists, saying something like... 6) We (me,Paul) took our(our group) bags ...seem perfectly cromulent to me, but then again, I am not a native speaker of English. 

3) Reflexive verbs This is a special class of verbs that require the presence of the reflexive pronoun always and they do not generally appear without it (also non as reflexiva tantum). They often do not convey any obvious reflexivity, reciprocity or passivity but are connected e.g. with some personal state. In Czech we have e.g.: bát se - to be afraid, smát se - to laugh, etc. Sometimes it is a little bit more difficult to distinguish, e.g. we have měnit - to change (st.) and měnit se - to undergo change and I would be very much inclined to classify the latter as reflexive verb, not a transitive verb with reflexive pronoun, because the subject here is not necessarily the source of the action. Interestingly enough, in old Indo-European languages like Latin, A.Greek and Sanskrit, this was typically expressed synthetically by something called medio-passive (or sometimes middle) voice, with pretty similar type of verbs, e.g. A.Greek mainomai - I am crazy. The middle voice could be used for reflexivity in transitives but the verbs we classify as reflexiva tantum in Czech could, in Greek, be similarly restricted to the medio-passive form (as in: no active voice form for them - hence their Latin designation verba deponentia).
