Racism has been a defining trait in how human civilizations have interacted and developed in regard to each other. It, however, is founded on differences which separate us visibly but not functionally. Can of worms; 'nuff said. What if there were real differences? Presume a species with a baseline level of intelligence and interbreedability; assume them to even be humans for now. However, say there is a very distinct sliding scale of physical functionality which begins to emerge upon puberty: on one end, they are possessed of superhuman strength and endurance, but have post-puberty lifespans of only a few years before their bodies fail. On the other hand, they are practically biologically immortal, yet utterly frail and weak. Assume, again, a normal (bell-shaped) distribution along this scale. Most importantly, there is a very visible external indication of this, whether it is body size or some other manner of odd phenomena (skin markings, hair color, eye size, whatever). How would society develop? What if the distribution is very lopsided in one direction or another? 

You could argue, that outside the solar system there is too much radiation and for the travel you need better protection from that. The magnetic field of the sun provides you that. It doesn't have to be exactly radiation, but we still don't know too much about interstellar space, so there might be some handwavium that prevents your unobtanium from working there. This also gives you nice "Currently teleportation isn't working" options from solar rays and the such. 

Anything above 8000 meters is called 'the Death Zone'. People can be there, but only for short periods. Altitude sickness is worst when you sleep - if you go to fall asleep that high, you'll probably die. Mt. Everest can be climbed without supplemental oxygen, but climbers sleep at a lower altitude (starting from around 7500, ascending to the top and then quickly descending back to at least 7500, probably lower). Your mountain isn't technical nor particularly hard to climb. On a good day, an explorer might start from 7500 meters, push to 10km or so, then go back down - possibly way down, lowering the risk. 

Conquest and discovery has been an important part of developing the global political structure of today's Earth. After we expand and settle other planets, whether within the same solar system or not, eventually the colonies will grow and develop to the extent where they feel able to self-govern. Given that extraterrestrial colonies and their resources would be incredibly valuable to their parent government, they would be naturally hesitant to let them go, whether because of fear of a lack of control or fear that the new government will be forcibly assumed by a competing terrestrial government. Easily, historical examples can be found by looking at overseas colonies - except for two incongruities: firstly, the process of setting up not only a self-sufficient extraterrestrial colony, but a self-expanding extraterrestrial colony would require much more assistance than, say, setting up a self-expanding overseas colony. Additionally, the area available for a colony to expand into is much greater than historically: there's a whole planet out there! Would the self-governing colonies, after they finally stabilize, cover much greater area than their parent nations? Would it be continental, global, or even include the local moon(s)? Would they be powerful enough to peacefully hold this territory, or would competing, established governments/colonies be conterminously fighting for greater resources? How would the situation differ were the planet found inhabitable as opposed to requiring a (possibly international) terraforming project? In short, what type of interplanetary political structure would be most likely to develop, and what historical parallels are there to support your claims? 

Yes, the notion that democracies are inferior is completely wrong Autocracies might be better at a short-term scientific blitz (i.e. you know exactly what you need, and you can concentrate all resources on this task). But that's about it. In the long-ish run (decade+) a democracy will prevail. There are a bunch of reasons: 

Humans did have "weapons" (and in a way still do) - the gorillas (for instance) can defend themselves quite well. With time those "weapons" became less relevant (even counter-effective at times) and gradually declined. Of course, those "weapons" are limited when compared to a carnivore (such as a lion), but that's just nature, carnivores will always be better equipped. In fact, it is believed that the fact we are not carnivores (but omnivores) was highly important to our evolution. While herbivores spend much of their day eating food, and carnivores hunt fast and then are inactive for the rest of the day (one meat meal is enough), omnivores combine the best of two worlds. They do look for food (a challenge) but also have "free" time, and are otherwise far more versatile and flexible. Some evolutionists believe (see the link above) that those factors were crucial for humanity to develop intelligence. 

A world much like earth has a society which, although rather aware of metals, does not possess the knowledge or resources to refine ore and produces alloys. They have access to practically unlimited wood and a variety of stone and volcanic glasses, but the only metals they can utilize are whatever native examples are found in the ground. Would they be able to develop semi-robust computing? It would be bulky, but surely not impossible to develop non-electrical analytic devices: it has already been developed. Could it be done without metals, though? More importantly, would it? Assuming the society lived in peace and relative comfort, able to pursue academic issues at ease, and had fully optimized wooden/stone construction and tools, I imagine would have a relatively developed society. Would they conceive of and peruse the construction of a metal-free computer? 

Make sex the reward of the truest believers and make them produce the offspring. Lets say the special 5% can participate. You could even selectively breed the best humans for your tastes, the stupidest ones to make them easy to control. Or maybe the most beautiful ones(beauty ~= biological perfection) And the rest would live in chaste. 

I'm suggesting the Kugelblitz. What fancier way to power your craft than a black hole made out of light? Using high-power lasers you could create a black hole, and use the hawking radiation as a source of power. Basically a battery. For ideal output its life should be made to be about 8 years.(For space exploration at least) But it could be tuned to anything you like, even 10 000 years. Perhaps create multiple ones to get long-term power. Another alternative is to just feed the black hole with arbitrary matter. It works on sand, water, air or whatever you happen to have. So after its created its basically a matter - energy converter. The output of a 4.5 year lasting, 600 000 tonne black hole would be 160 Petawatts. I think you could get by with much less, though that would increase the mass significantly. The problem is the immense amount of energy needed. The common options include using nano robots to convert mercury(the planet) into a dyson sphere of small solar panels. Creating the 8year blackhole would take about a week(If I remember correctly) of the suns output. But the evaporation time(thus the output power) reduces exponentially with weight/energy input. So it might be possible. Good video about Kugelblitz(Also includes other stuff) 

Giant winged beasts such as the Roc and the western dragon feature strongly in mythology. Is there a maximum size on a biological winged flying creature? How would an atmosphere different from Earth's change such a limit? 

It depends on society's view of the creatures, their control over their wereishness, and how much the higher-ups know about each other. Assuming the most likely situation, that society fears and hates them, that they totally lose it once a month, and they they more-or-less all know they are all werewolves, it become simply a game of self-preservation and MAD. Threats: Losing control over yourself once a month, even if it's by turning in a fearsome beast, is a very vulnerable situation for somebody with lots of enemies, both within your organization and without. Seriously, it just takes ten guys armed with silver weapons. Gangs, while always hated by everybody, normally operate more-or-less under-the-radar, and rarely are outright despised by the whole of society. If word gets out that the capital city is run by monsters hated by everybody, no matter how strong they are, they are eventually going to fall to the force of an enraged public. Therefore, you'd have to keep this knowledge as concealed as possible from everybody, probably by threat of personal harm. It's easier if they have something to gain from you on a regular basis, so gang leaders would have to keep both whichever of their members and their 'property' who discover their secret convinced that it's in their best interest not to spill the beans and bring it all down. Of course, if they get too greedy, well, dead men don't talk. MAD: The reason mutual assured destruction would set in is because the leaders of each gang know all the above. While they may try to kill and destroy each other, a stability would develop simply because they have an unstoppable weapon: knowledge that the other gang is full of wereanimals. Move too far or push too hard, and eventually somebody will drop the bomb, even if it destroys them as well. Given the assumptions made at the top, there's no reason they'd ever want the word out, no matter how much the personal threat could help them. The information is just too dangerous. 

We are intelligent because in order to reproduce this way we needed to find and convince our pairs that we are the right ones. And because we got more intelligent, we were able to choose more ideal mates. Also heterogamy results in a much much wider biodiversity(Without this you usually* don't get any biodiversity at all.) The way you could achieve your goals is through controlled mutations/biological engineering, which could produce sufficient biodiversity for survival and perhaps even more. If you choose biological engineering it would be very hard to get to that point without mutations or heterogamy. Controlled mutations could be on the other hand an alternative evolutionary way, tough its hard to reason how and why would such a thing win against heterogamy. 

Physical tokens of money and discussion of money and economics are considered vulgar and crass in this culture, yet there is a vast economic gulf between the very poor and the very rich. There is a large pressure to be able to maintain outward appearances at even great cost; otherwise, one would try to avoid being seen in 'cultured public' and to constrain their interactions to only other underworld lowest-class like themselves. Just to be clear: there is money, and it's used often. Just not talked about or done 'in public'. I imagine middle-class shopkeeping and merchandising professions would be looked upon with contempt and disgust, which would further divide the social classes. Additionally, little to no economic theory would be developed--again, reinforcing the current status quo. However, what could the origins of this society be? What could some historical/cultural influences be which would cause this society to have developed? E: a bit more information: Friendly 'gifting' (really a form of barter) plays a large part in day-to-day life. Commercial stores are typically built and placed to allow discreet entry and exit. Once purchased and paid for, the product will typically be delivered to the buyer's home address, where they will give a token gift to the deliverer, thus making it clear it's just another friendly exchange, nothing so dirty as a money-related transaction. Many people do their own spending and moneykeeping--as much in the privacy of their own home as possible--but many more hire others, and rarely if ever learn the state of their own accounts. But why could such a taboo develop? 

As a side note, I feel that your case for autocracies is somewhat biased - you seem to look at examples like Nazi Germany or 40's-50's USSR. Those are young autocracies and are extremely unrepresentative of autocracies as a whole. Take a look at established, older, autocracies like 80's USSR or better yet, absolute monarchies in Europe (France before the revolution). Thing is, with time, autocracies tend to get worse - the population is less enthusiastic about the ideology, the leaders grow distant and corrupt, the critical political & economical thinking disappears (no opposition). On the other hand, democracies get better - people gain belief in the system, stability creates democratic values (which target corruption), the opposition derives change and progress...
