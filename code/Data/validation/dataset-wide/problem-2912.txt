So, where does that leave us with Heidegger's claim? Interestingly, 20th century linguistics has given an interesting twist to some of the most speculative (philosophical) ideas by reformulating them in a naturalized manner. In this vein Plato's innatism (the claim that humans have access to certain inborn ideas) has been revived by Noam Chomsky and is today the standard explanation of how children can acquire language skills that fast. (See also Plato's Problem.) Similarly, the claim that the connection between linguistic meaning and language is in some cases not conventional has been revived in linguistics and forms the basis of a whole field of investigation called Phonosemantics. The successfully tested hypothesis here is that vocal sounds have meaning and, in particular, that phonemes (the "building blocks" of any language) have meaning. This is not really Heidegger's original claim (in the same way that Chomsky's contribution is a long shot from Plato's original conception), but is an interesting revival nonetheless. Still, this just shows that the connection between natural languages and linguistic meaning is not conventional in some cases. It doesn't provide any argument as to why this meaning might be relevant to philosophical reasoning. 

I would argue that the image referenced simply cannot be classified as a argument, but is a figure of speech. (Beware, I am not implying here that arguments can't be employed as or in figures of speech; my point is that not every figure of speech gives an argument.) It is therefore a matter of rhetorical/semiotic analysis and not of logic to understand what the picture is trying to convey. Linguistics has a whole field of study devoted to such questions. I am not an expert in the aforementioned field, but my guess is the following: the image-text plays with the meaning of the word as "lack of something" in combination with negative and positive phenomenons, and with the implied meaning of the word . It works in the following way: 

Kant's Die Metaphysik der Sitten (The Metaphysics of Morals, 1797), on the other side, is concerned with applied or empirical practical reason, which includes virtues and vices, foundations of law and politics. 

The theoretical sciences include prominently what Aristotle calls first philosophy, or metaphysics as we now call it, but also mathematics, and physics, or natural philosophy. Physics studies the natural universe as a whole, and tends in Aristotle's hands to concentrate on conceptual puzzles pertaining to nature rather than on empirical research; but it reaches further, so that it includes also a theory of causal explanation and finally even a proof of an unmoved mover thought to be the first and final cause of all motion. Many of the puzzles of primary concern to Aristotle have proven perennially attractive to philosophers, mathematicians, and theoretically inclined natural scientists. Practical sciences are less contentious, at least as regards their range. These deal with conduct and action, both individual and societal. Practical science thus contrasts with theoretical science, which seeks knowledge for its own sake, and, less obviously, with the productive sciences, which deal with the creation of products external to sciences themselves. Both politics and ethics fall under this branch. Finally, then, the productive sciences are mainly crafts aimed at the production of artefacts, or of human productions more broadly construed. The productive sciences include, among others, ship-building, agriculture, and medicine, but also the arts of music, theatre, and dance. Another form of productive science is rhetoric, which treats the principles of speech-making appropriate to various forensic and persuasive settings, including centrally political assemblies. 

To get an overview of the actual argument deployed in TD and also get a better grasp on how TD fits into Kant's broader project, you may read a very good summary from a philosophy course at UC Davis. 

The point of the distinction is, usually, to draw the attention to the fact that, while epistemic reasons do make the claim they justify more likely to be true, pragmatic reasons do not. (1) seems to be justifiable on the basis of evidential reasons. However, ask yourself if (2) is a claim for which evidential reasons can be given: Is there any evidence which would make (2) more likely to be true? Or is it a claim justified by pragmatic reasons? 

This is not a specific (argumentative) fallacy. It is a humorous conflation between the ordinal and the cardinal use of numbers, e.g. "the sixth finger" vs. "five fingers" in this case. As an aside: There was an interesting experiment with children (age 4, I think) that shows how humans have an early understanding of cardinality. (I don't remember the source.) It goes like this: the subject is shown ten cookies in a row. The subject is asked how many cookies there are. The subject proceeds to count them and answers "ten". A cookie mid-row is taken away and the question is repeated. Now, the interesting result is that a certain percentage of children count the cookies by their cardinal order, note that the "six(th)" is gone, but that the "ten(th)" is still there and conclude that there are still "ten" cookies in front of them. 

Extending previous answers by ChaosAndOrder and Dennis… You seem to appreciate why "pure" logic (I take it that you mean classical first order logic) is useful in the context of mathematical logic, but you don't see the point in formalizing other modal notions in ordinary language. While presenting you the many applications of modal logic might convince you, it may be easier to indicate how modal logic was important in the development of the very field of mathematical logic that you seem to appreciate. The formalization of modal logic has been a breakthrough in the development of model theory, one of the four branches of mathematical logic (the other being set theory, recursion theory and proof theory). See Kripke semantics for more details. Modal logic has found some very natural applications in metalogic, such as provability logic (where □ means 'it is provable that'). A milestone in the analysis of provability is Solovay's arithmetical completeness theorem published in 1976. Another interesting (but very advanced) example is the use of modal logic to study the relations between forcing extensions in set theory. See Hamkins & Loewe, The Modal Logic of Forcing, 2005: 

Since the dual component view of belief is said to be the standard account of belief and it includes the view that 

Mathematics is not infinitely regressive, because the establishment of a set of axioms from which all interesting theorems follow has been in fact not only finite, but realizable. Specifically a set of axioms cannot be further analyzed if all the axioms are independent. 

This seems a reasonable assumption, at first: The act of voting caused the election of X. If we take for granted that there is a link between causation and moral responsibility, then it would seem that A's voting makes him morally responsible for the election of X. Additionally, A is not just morally responsible for the act of voting, but also for the downstream consequences of this act. There are, however, two problems which renders this assumption worthy of being questioned: How far does moral responsibility go? A is not just morally responsible for the act of voting, but also for the downstream consequences of this act. However, there seems to be a limit as to how far this chain of consequences can go: Voter A caused the election of X; X brought on a certain state of political affairs; did A bring on that state of political affairs? Causation may be seen as a transitive relation (if x causes y and y causes z, then x causes z), in which case the answer is yes. However, it is dubious under which conditions moral responsibility can be transitive in the same way: If A is morally responsible for the election of X; and if X is morally responsible for the current state of political affairs; is A morally responsible for the current state of political affairs? An affirmative answer to this question becomes even more improbable if we take a very basic principle in ethics that A is morally responsible (and therefore potentially morally blameworthy) for an occurrence E only if E is a consequence of some culpable act on A's part. Since the act of voting is in no way a culpable act per se, A cannot be held responsible for any nefarious consequences of this act. Therefore, Principle P fails. Does partial causal contribution lead to moral responsibility? In a setting such as mass elections, where group agency causes the election of X, what is the causal role of a single vote? Somewhere between very little and none. If we agree that moral responsibility diminish as the degree of causal contribution diminishes, then the moral responsibility is very little to none - even if it isn't easy to precisely quantify the causal contribution of each of the voters to the occurrence of the election's outcome. Still, we could envision an electoral tie. In this context a vote can be "more" causally efficacious then others. This is called the vote's "pivotal" (i.e. effective) role in the election's result. However, it can be shown that the probability that A's vote is effective and affects the election's outcome is practically non-existent (e.g. minuscule wrt to A's probability of winning a lottery!). Again, A's moral responsibility for the election's outcome is almost non-existent. Therefore, Principle P fails. Conclusion If Principle P doesn't hold, i.e. if even voter A who voted for X is not morally responsible for the state of political affairs brought on by X, then it is not really conceivable how a voter B, who didn't vote for X, might be morally responsible for the state of political affairs brought on by X. 

You probably are looking for the term "expanding circle", which is also the title of one of Singer's books: The Expanding Circle: Ethics and Sociobiology, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1981. 

Kant distinguishes between theoretical and practical reason. But those two types of reasons are "ultimately one and the same reason which has to be distinguished simply in its applications".1 Those reasons can, further, be "pure" or "applied". As a first approximation, this distinction can be understood in analogy to the a priori/a posteriori distinction. (Be aware that Kant branches these distinctions the other way around too: there is pure and non-pure reason, which can be uses in a theoretical and in a practical way.) So, Kant's critique of pure reason is, in fact, a critique of pure theoretical reason. And he starts his preface in the Critique of practical reason explicitly addressing his title: 

It's not really an introduction to the history of philosophy; it uses a problem-oriented approach, yet it covers most historical classics. Last, but not least: The book is enjoyable to read. 

It is important to note that "pure" is not a synonym for "theoretical". Kant uses two orthogonal distinctions: 

Yes! Scientific theories include important "non-empirical claims"! You might want to distinguish between different types of "non-empirical claims" that come up in science: 

See his "Idealism Vindicated", in: D. Zimmerman and P. van Inwagen (eds) Persons: Human and Divine, OUP 2007, pp. 35-54. Furthermore, there are some contemporary idealist philosophers in the broader sense (i.e. as a full-fledged philosophical position - idealism as in "German idealism"). Vittorio Hösle is a very well known contemporary idealist philosopher:
