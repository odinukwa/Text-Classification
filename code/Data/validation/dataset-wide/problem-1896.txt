Threats sometimes work. Sometimes you need to escalate. If the individual doesn't leave you alone after being threatened about going to the boss, then go to the boss. If the boss doesn't do anything after being threatened to go to HR, then go to HR. If HR doesn't do anything after being threatened with a lawsuit, then get your lawyer involved. Start with the easiest/simplest, then work up to the most involved. 

You could contact an Agency in the part of the US where you would like to work. They can advise you of conditions required for a work Visa, and if they have any openings that match your skills and experience. Six months is a rather short period for many contracts, but perhaps 12 would work. In my experience, companies tend to favor those who might be around longer if needed, and who know where they want to be. They may be concerned that you will decide you don't like the US after a few weeks and will leave. You could also think about working for a UK-based company that has offices in the US. Additionally, if you are a new graduate, your university's placement office may be able to help. 

Some of these may help. But they may not. Handing out pay increases is often limited by budget issues beyond the scope of your manager. In recent years, some companies haven't given much (if any) in the way of raises to even their best employees. I have some real stars on my team. I'd love to give them a much bigger raise, but the budget I'm given doesn't allow for that. They still deliver excellent work. 

It will be hard to be "perfect" without any experience, so strive for "adequate, but with lots of potential" instead. You simply need to convince the interviewer that you possess the attributes they desire in an admin. Determine what's important to them for their particular admin position (punctuality? attention to detail? expertise with office software? etc) and show them that you have those attributes in spades. Explain how hard of a worker you are and how your background would make you a particularly valuable admin. The fact that dealing with people face to face is good for you personally has no bearing on why someone should hire you. Don't bring that fact up in an interview. 

In this context, "unqualified" means the same as "with no reservations". Basically the boss is saying that he can recommend the laid off individual highly, without have to temper or qualify his praise. It's clearly a positive. Nothing negative here. 

Your first step is to stop applying for testing positions. If you want to be a developer, start applying for development positions instead. I run QA at my company. When I hire interns, it's a short-term position. Since almost no colleges actually teach testing, I am forced to accept folks without any testing background at all and teach them enough to be productive for a while. Your resume might make you appealing for such a position. But your lack of desire to be a professional tester also means I would never hire you for a full time position. Good testers want to be testers. I can't afford to hire people who will be unhappy in short order. If you don't want to be a tester, apply for non-testing positions. Stop taking the easy route just because you happen to have Selenium on your resume. Instead, apply for positions that might make you stretch a bit more, but will actually take you down the path a bit to what you really want. 

You shouldn't feel unprofessional for doing whatever you deem important for your personal health. Some folks need to rest their eyes. Some folks need to take a quick bathroom break frequently. Some need to stand up, stretch, or take a short walk. Most folks don't need such an app. But if you need something to remind you to look away from your monitor periodically, then just use it and learn to ignore your colleagues. Make sure such apps or browser extensions are permitted on work machines before you install them. Try not to do it during a meeting, during periods where you are working directly with others, or when your immediate attention is needed. But it's generally not that hard to grab a few seconds or a minute when you need it. 

Large firms have reorgs and transfers all the time. And large firms hire new employees all the time. Given that, it's not unusual for a hiring manager to hire a new employee and be transferred, both within a short time period. 

Unless they were deciding company direction without involving you, it's hard to see that discussing "work items" over brunch is something that should bother you. Has something occurred that makes you so suspicious? Hopefully not. I'm assuming that during this brunch nothing major was decided that you can't undo. Trust that your CEO knows how to tell when you must be involved in food and talk going forward. 

Yes, you are missing something. No, it's not bad management. You are missing the concept of "company culture". Every company either deliberately or unintentionally develops a corporate culture. That culture influences the overall way the company operates, how it treats its customers, and how it treats its employees. Some companies believe that it's very important to give their employees a bunch of small perks - games, activities, free food, free snacks, etc - as a way of making things fun, and hopefully generating loyalty, retaining staff, getting more work hours out of salaried employees, etc. Other companies believe that it's more important to spend their money on salaries, rather than spread it across a bunch of smaller perks. Again, they are hoping to generate loyalty, retain staff, be more productive, etc. Some companies offer food in order to encourage employees to come in early and/or leave later. Other companies provide a robust network that allow employees to work effectively from home. Some companies spend money on training as a way to grow their employees' talents and retain them. Other companies tend to hire more senior staff who need less training. Some companies have a culture of watching every penny carefully. Other companies spend more freely. Some companies drive their employees very hard, in order to maximize the quarterly profits. Other companies are more laid-back and focus on the longer term. Some companies grow and contract rapidly, in response to market demand. Other companies are very slow to fire and equally slow to hire. I interviewed at one company whose stated policy was to overpay their top-performing 5%, so that they cannot afford to leave. They also distinctly underpaid their bottom 5% in hopes that they would seek work elsewhere. I worked at one company that served dinner to everyone who worked through dinner time. Unfortunately, they found that many folks just stayed for the dinner and left immediately afterwards, and thus weren't actually being as productive as hoped - so they ended the practice. I worked at another company that provided tons of similar perks - free soda, lots of games like pool, ping-pong, and Foosball, free popcorn - it was very much a dorm-inspired culture. It was fun and they attracted many young workers willing to work fairly long hours - until the company went public and started to tank. Then repeated rounds of layoffs caused "retention" not to be an issue for the company any more. Etc, etc. There are many ways to put together a company, to nurture it and to grow it. There are no right or wrong answers here. None of these are "bad management" in and of themselves, only "different approaches". 

You should not put your reasons for leaving your current job on your CV/resume or cover letter. Those are vehicles for presenting your credentials, and the positive reasons for why you would be perfect in this new job, not for discussing why your current job isn't working out. Be ready to answer the question "Why are you leaving your current job after such a short duration?", since it will almost certainly come up during an interview. Try hard not to bash the company (hiring managers don't like to hear any company-bashing). Instead, focus on the fact that the job ended up not being what you had hoped. @WesleyLong has this great suggestion: "I was hired to do programming, but as time went on, it became clear the role they needed was in operations, not development, and I realized I was not going to be a good long-term fit for the position.". As you can see - no bashing there, just an acknowledgement that the fit wasn't right. And also be ready to convey why you are sure your next job will be a keeper for the long run. Prepare for your job search and interviews by thinking hard about your current company. Was there something you could have done to understand the real situation before you accepted the offer? Were there questions you could have asked? Was there someone else you could have talked with during the interview process that would have given you better insight? (I always try to talk with my future boss, at least one future peer, and all the people who would work for me, whenever possible) Try to apply what you learn to your next interviews. You don't want to end up in another bad job. Have several very short jobs in your career is something you'd probably like to avoid if possible.
