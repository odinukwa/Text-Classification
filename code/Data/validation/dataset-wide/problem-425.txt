When defending they can make sure there are not long lines of sight. Placing objects everywhere, etc. When attacking humans who can see further it gets more difficult, if they themselves are prepared, because they would do the opposite and have long sightlines. The short-sighted ones would need to disrupt sightlines with smokescreens as people pointed out in the comments. When they have access to current military technology they would have stuff like strike drones, etc. They just need to be able to watch a screen and not see into the distance. In short: They will not ever stand a chance in soldier battles, but they are basically on even footing with humans in everything else, so they would not need special tactics with this. 

If we ignore that then there is no further answer to be provided, since the leftover question of what would happen to society is very opinion-based. A more realistic scenario would be a world-wide EMP. But the problem of the question being mostly opinion-based is still there. 

Yes, we could stay healthy To my understanding the reason behind the weakening of a mars colonists bone structure is that they are permanently experiencing low gravity and their body is "overequipped" for that. So over an extended period of time the body will build less bone support. (People born on Mars would never even have a bone structure as strong as ours) In my opinion the bone structure would not decay as it is still required daily. They would severely struggle for 16 hours a day if the structure was weakened. There is still a need for that, just as there is on earth. So there would be no or barely any decay in the structure and thus no impedance of ones health. 

In this system, your 'forgotten' deity is going to be fighting quite an uphill battle. Several have already stated how to get started, and at first, this will likely work. In most of the larger religions, only a few thousand at the top will get the direct ear of their deity, everyone else having to hope that the majority of the church supports the same goals as them. In a smaller church, each member will have a greater access and influence over the goals and direction of the deity they are powering. They are willing to give up access to greater power for more direct influence of a lesser power. The real problem comes in when larger deities start to take notice. They don't want to lose their power and influence. The top deities will likely have established an accord between each other to help them all maintain their positions of authority over the world. "Better to share it with the others at the top than risk losing everything." That doesn't mean the top deities won't be looking for chances to stab each other in the backs, though. The best chance a 'forgotten' deity would have is to reach out to someone at the top for protection from the others. Perhaps a former ally. Maybe not even at the top, but someone fairly high, someone high enough to either create a distraction or otherwise shield them from the view of those at the top until they have enough of a base from which to challenge the top. Perhaps reaching out to a god of chaos who is willing to stir things up, who hates how the top have remained in power for so long and doesn't really care who replaces them. 

Making the Humor Funny Others have done a good job explaining why things can be funny, so I'll focus on how to make your non-human humor amusing to the audience. I think the best way to go about it is to find a way to get the audience to laugh at the alien's sense of humor, rather than with. The audience most likely won't get the joke, either due to a lack of understanding of the societal relevance of it or because the joke falls outside of the person's idea of comedy. However, you can still make this scene humorous. Have a human-like character interact with the aliens and have them comically misunderstand the joke, or have them simply not get it and let the aliens poke fun at the human for not understanding what was said. The reverse also works. Drax from Guardians of the Galaxy had no understanding of human figure of speech, but his serious reactions brought about by the misunderstanding was very funny. His own attempts at being humorous, by contrast, would also be funny for the viewer because watching someone fail can also be a form of comedy. Maybe the alien gets annoyed when their attempts at humor are disregarded by their human companions, or when they fail to understand the comedy of the human's jokes. Because of our love of subversion and humor that plays on the discomfort and confusion of others even a character who doesn't understand puns and thinks a metaphor is a type of bird can still be hilarious. 

First off, I assume they aren't abandoning ALL technology, like, even the fulcrum (lever, club), wheel, pulley, swords, bows and arrows. All amazing technologies, revolutionary in their times, and normally present in magic using stories. Best way to look at your question, IMHO, is that the magic is just another field of technology. So the real question becomes, "What would make a society use one technology and shun another?" Others above have hit on a couple major points, economic reasons, social convention, and societal control being the major and most plausible themes. Those answer above go into fairly good detail on those routes, so I'll go another. FEAR One answer briefly touched on this but didn't take it very far. Some event, perhaps a war, or religious preacher, has stirred up fear in the populous to abandon a specific type/category of technology forcing them to repurpose and utilize the technologies that remain. In our own history, there are many who fervently called for the complete abandonment of anything to do with nuclear power following the Chyrnoble incident. In the years prior the populace was full of visions of a nuclear future, everything powered by nuclear fission (and maybe someday fusion). There were even plans for nuclear cars and planes. While some of that was infeasible to begin with, the point remains that the public fear following Chyrnoble and other such accidents shut down a significant portion of our research into the field for almost two generations, and there are still those claiming that we shouldn't be doing any research in nuclear science at all. So what if the extremists had won out? What if the fear of a given technologies dangers was so overwhelming that they banned it as a society. There would still be those who refuse, those who continue to research and study the banned technology despite any laws or social strictures against it, but the society as a whole would find other ways to live without the banned technology. One of my favorite webcomics is a very magical world, but the specific category of fire magic is socially banned (in some places the ban is legally enforced) due to the nature of fire being wild and unpredictable. Everyone in their world who uses fire magic burns themselves, burns the world around them, and eventually, they are almost guaranteed to kill themselves with fire and release a raging magical inferno that will take days to extinguish. Or so we have been told. That is what the people believe, and this fear keeps all but the most sociopathic of people from reaching out to fire magic. It has been hinted in the comic that fire can be controlled if you have a calm mind, but since only the insane ever try, they end up erupting and reinforcing the public fear. Will our protagonist risk the taboo and try to control fire through calm? I've no idea, but it's been fun reading so far. 

Ice skates. Or more specifically, bladed boots. In aerial combat it would allow you to slash at enemies below you without compromising your flight stance while leaving your hands open to carry some sort of buckler to defend against the attacks from others. With your arms free you could double the foot blades up with heavy darts to use as a thrown projectile. Your opponents have a big frame due to their wings, and you just need to damage the wings to make them plummet, so killing power isn't necessary. You can also drop the darts from overhead before engaging with the blades. Combat would involve a lot of drops and swoops as the two fighters attempt to get on top of and behind their opponent to slash at the unarmored wings (placing armor on the wings might make them too heavy to fly). Because the blades are on your legs your wings won't be easily reached by your opponent to retaliate without them doing an awkward flip or carrying a spear that might bump into their flapping wings and make them fall, and you can answer the spear by dropping a dart on their head. It might make landing more difficult, but not impossible. You'd just have to remove them after the battle is over similar to taking off your armor. 

Advantages at the biological level can help alleviate disadvantages at the societal level. The wolf people could breed faster than humans with the trade off of having a shorter life expectancy. Humans produce a single child at a time while the wolves produce four or five in small litters. While the human population would have a much higher cap due to the superiority of agriculture over hunting, the wolves would be able to bounce back from major population loss much quicker than the humans could. It also means that while their population density is lower, they are able to propagate and spread across a much wider territory faster than humans can. Wolves have fur. It might not seem like much, but fur is what allows other mammals to thrive in the wilderness without need for housing. Humans are extremely vulnerable to the elements, where as the wolf people would be able to survive fairly comfortably in the wilderness even during winter. No need for buildings means their entire society is mobile, which makes hunting them down much more difficult. Humans have incredible stamina, but we sacrifice sprinting speed for it. The wolves, while not as fast as real life wolves due to sacrificing speed for bipedalism and tool use, could well be faster sprinters than humans. This would potentially make them better at hit and run tactics, rushing in to wound enemies before quickly escaping into the woods faster than humans can keep up. Wolves could also have superior tracking senses. Better smell, stronger eyes, and better hearing. All things they'd need as a hunting species, and all of which provides a strong logistical advantage when maneuvering troops. If the wolves are nocturnal they gain a significant advantage over their human adversaries at night without losing much during the day. Humans deal with nocturnal predators by shutting our doors at night, but a nocturnal predator that can open doors or windows becomes much more dangerous. All these traits lend the wolves well toward a specific type of society. Raiding Culture The main thing holding the wolves back is the inefficiency of their food production, but there is one significant food source available that grows it's own crops and has a tendency to all congregate in single areas that can be spotted from miles away. Humans. Humans make a fine food source for the wolves. So do the humans' cattle and other livestock, and it's extremely difficult to defend farming communities from a dedicated band of fast moving, nocturnal predators that can plan as well as a human can. Furthermore, it would take significant effort to hunt down the small nomadic tribes through thick forests in an attempt to find bandits that don't necessarily need to set up camp. Humans will develop technology faster, but the wolves can steal it. Wolves shouldn't have an issue stealing more advanced gear and figuring out how it works, as well as how to make their own. The human population will find it hard to expand into new territories because wolves are already present there before the humans can set up their infrastructure. The human population has a harder time growing out of control because they have intelligent natural predators keeping them from expanding, and any battle that occurs that the humans don't win 5 to 1 will end in a long term advantage for the wolves because they rebound faster. So long as the wolves avoid large scale, open field battles they should be able to survive by preying on the fringes of human society and making it all but impossible to expand deeply into their own territory with constant raiding. This lifestyle can be further enhanced with good ships and/or horses to improve mobility even further.
