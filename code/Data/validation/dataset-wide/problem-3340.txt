Serbian has something like that, if I am understanding you right. Some Serbian intransitive sentences can still have dative, genitive and/or locative arguments; an example for this would be (she is telling him about the house) where there's both a dative listener (to him) and a locative topic (about the house). We are certain that neither of these is a direct object because 1) neither is in either the genitive or the accusative (Serbian DOs must be in either one of those cases) and 2) neither can be made into the subject of a passive verb form: sentences such as (he is told about the house) and (the house is told to him) do not work and sound quite ungrammatical. The only passive sentences these two arguments could fit in would be in the spirit of (it was talked to him about the house) and those kinds of sentences still retain both the locative and dative arguments. Furthermore, it is possible to add an accusative into the example sentence, thus for example giving: . Such a sentence can easily be turned into a passive one, giving f.e. where the former accusative argument "причу" becomes a nominative argument "прича" in accordance with general passivisation patterns in nominative languages. The only way these sentences could be analysed as including a direct object would be to analyse them as having a dropped or implied accusative argument, which is otherwise unheard of in Serbian. This also has a parallel in sentences with a non-nominative subject; a sentence with a genitive, accusative or dative subject is usually intransitive, but can also have additional arguments that do not serve as direct objects. With a genitive subject, these are most often sentences in the mould of (there's no job for us) or have an experiencer (such as it's you who I'm ashamed of; this sentence has two genitive arguments). With a dative subject, they are usually those with experiencers, such as (he feels cold, more directly it's cold to him). With an accusative subject, they also usually are with experiencers, such as (I feel sorry for the child). Such sentences with non-nominative subjects and additional arguments but without a DO still cannot be passivised. They'd give sentences like , and ; these sound utterly wrong and ungrammatical. The closest equivalents would have to use different verbs or phrasings for that, giving (we don't have a job), (it's you who I'm ashamed of), and (I pity the child), which are all sentences with DOs and a dropped pronominal subject. 

Nothing is inherently more conservative than anything else because pretty much every word is changed as time goes on. Some words acquire irregularities, but these get reanalysed as regular patterns over time. A few examples are in "man/men" and "work/wrought". Now, conjunctions are just regular words that change. Let's take your "and" for example. It derives from Old English "and/ond/end", which derives in turn from Proto-Germanic "*andi/*anþi" or "*undi/*unþi". German has from that source "und", Dutch has "en" and Scots has "an". Further away in the Germanic family, there's "ok/og/och" in Scandinavian, from Proto-Germanic "*auk" whence also English "eke", and Gothic had a suffix instead, "-uh". This is all the product of semantic shift (change in word meaning over time) and sound change (change of word shape over time) 

The deletion of certain and all in Bulgarian is an effect of Havlík's law, and the forms and are demonstrative of Bulgarian's word-final devoicing; all Bulgarian obstruents lose voicing word-finally and the underlying forms are actually and Other than that, the plural is formed with, among others, a suffix /-i/ As to answering the question, I'd just analyse the plural forms as , nothing more. 

A less-than-quick Google search links to an article on the doiSerbia website that seems to say that adjectives and nouns are probably most susceptible to diachronic change, but the conclusions were based on corpus analyses within the last half a century. I don't know how true this is but to each his own: there might be some truth in that, might as well not. There's a generally-known and otherwise pretty unsourceable statement that most commonly used lexical items are the most prone to irregularity and change, which makes sense as they are more frequently used. Don't know where I heard it or picked it up, but I'm a firm believer in it. This can be backed up by looking at the statistical fact that the copula, some elementary terms regarding kinship, obligation, quality and quantity (good, bad, big, small), grammatical polarity (yes, no), pronouns and numerals are most commonly irregular and exhibit unpredictable and unexpected changes and are the ones that most frequently show suppletive paradigms. Even in highly regular languages that have a very high level of regularity, the copula and core terms have patterns that deviate from the norm (olla (to be), veli (brother) in Finnish, olmak (to be) in Turkish etc.) even while most of the rest of their vocabulary sticks to established and regular patterns. 

It is possible that this glyph is what Unicode calls VEDIC SIGN ARDHAVISARGA (seen in this codepoint list for the Vedic Extensions block). Despite its positioning in the Vedic Extensions block, its use is reportedly "not limited to Vedic." 

There is no such thing as a "difficult" language. Language "difficulty" is some scale or category that is inherently biased. When comparing two languages where one is closer to your native language than the other, the one closer shall be subjectively easier for you than the one less so close. Following your example of Swedish and Finnish, Swedish has hundreds of irregular verbs while Finnish has a one-digit number (most common being "täytyä", "olla", "ei", "erkanee", "korkenee"); Swedish, as a Germanic language, also has definiteness, a concept really difficult to follow for speakers of languages without definiteness. Additionally, for a Finn Estonian would be easier to learn than Swedish. I could go on, but that would be too specific and off-topic, so I'll just sum this up: Language difficulty is subjective. What is difficult for you is very easy for someone else. The reverse also applies. As to why languages develop how they develop and change complexity, that's a diachronics question that can't really be answered as it is far too broad. 

When unstressed, Swedish "och" is phonetically [ɔ], which isn't any different from Norwegian "og" [ɔ]. Referencing Danish is really not that informative as Danish has voiced most of its consonants so that even if it had "*ok", it would've gone to "og" either way (a generic example: Danish vs. Swedish bog & bok 'book'). My thoughts on it are that stressed "och" preserved the hard plosive while its unstressed variant lenited it to [ɣ] which was lost almost everywhere. Irregular sound changes, sure, but those are abundant and particularly full of holes. 

Now, there's the question of what exactly constitutes "British" English: is it RP, Estuary, something else? It's usually taken to be RP, so let's go with that. The agreement is basically: do what standard you adhere to, better if you know both ways. Nothing forces you to use General American over RP or vice versa.
