Work with your employer to construct a more resilient structure. As an example, you could have an assistant position in your team for someone who will be able to step in when you are unwell; assuming you are still able to talk to them about the current status of a project, to explain details etc, then handover is still very possible. In any team there will be people looking to step up the ladder, so there should be willing candidates for such a role. They may become competition for you, but there is no silver bullet here. In an ideal world I would suggest becoming a 2-person company with someone else, and being taken on together by an employer. That way you could train them to be able to step in, and come to some arrangement on pay and training with them privately. Unusual arrangements like this, however, are usually hard to sell to employers. By approaching your employer to seek to address the issue constructively, you should be able to come to a workable arrangement. If you do not, then events may decide things for you. 

Make sure that all the paperwork you'd need to get your next job is in order, check to see if your manager would give you a positive reference for your next job, update your resume, and start looking for your next job. The moment you're asked to leave, there's no real reason to have any sort of loyalty or attachment to your last company. They've chosen to cut you loose (and the end of the year's not the best time for that). At this point there's nothing left for you at your old company. You can always prove yourself at your next job. 

check if your office building allows it. Ours was in a residencial building but most local office spaces don't allow this. It really depends on the dog - if its a dog that sleeps much of the time, and just needs people present its a better office dog in many cases than one that's going to keep demanding people play fetch with it. There were games of fetch played over downtime sometimes tho. Have a 'dog/people' safe space when needed - our office dog was enthusiastic about greeting people, and sounded much larger than he was. We had a bed in the conference room or the director's office for when we needed to keep him out of the way cause someone was afraid of dogs and/or we had a delivery and wanted to avoid crushed dog. If possible, the intern might have a spare/old pen that might work well. Dogs are awesome stress relief. Its a lot easier if the dog's 'timings' work around work times - we parked the dog around lunch and after work, which worked well. Years after retirement, the dog still does his business at the same times ;). Doing it outside is essential - for obvious reasons. Yes, we're all adults here and I'm talking poo. 

You turn it down You accept, and fail to improve things like you predecessor You accept, and succeed 

I've heard of people doing this; one guy mentioned having an always-on video conference for remote work, which seems to be the usual context for this kind of appliance. Finally found it: Virtual Camaraderie His take on it - having a separate machine for the video conference - is what you're talking about. [Edit: also Project Stargate] I would make a few suggestions: 

I find the PERT estimation useful for software development tasks. Summarising: a = time if you fly through it, no delays, no problems b = time you think it will realistically take given known delays and known problems c = worst possible scenario, everything gets delayed, your other bosses give you extra work, and you find a flaw in your implementation at 80% through your plan Estimated time = (a + 4b + c) / 6 Variability = (c - a) / 6 Say you think a task would take a day in ideal conditions, and normally you'd get there in the next 2 days because of meetings, but there are a few stages that could cause problems and then it would be 9 days. Then your estimate is (1 + 4x2 + 9) / 6 = 3 days, variability is 1.3 days, so you would say "I expect to get it done in 3 days, but it could easily take 4.5 days." This way, they have an idea of when to expect it (for delivery to customers, you want to estimate the time to delivery in calendar days, including the effects of meetings, holidays and so on), and an idea of what a conservative estimate might look like. If there is a big variable, like 'it might break component X, so then I'd have to modify and rebuild that component, which would be an extra week', then flag that up in the response - 'I expect it to be done in 3 days, but it tests the limits of component X, so there could be an additional week there'. This is one of the hardest bits of working in small businesses with multiple competing demands on your time. So grasp it with both hands and don't shy away from giving estimates. The sooner you get a handle on it, the better things will be. If quizzed in person, don't be afraid to say "I can't give you an estimate that would be any use off-hand, let me send you something by the end of the day". Good luck. 

In a sense you're going to have to convince management that the changes you need are essential to get things running. You're probably also going to need to handle politics, and compliance, and so on. Its not going to be easy. 

This is simply unacceptable. In most companies this should be reported to HR, or suitable authorities. I'd like to use a certain set of 3 4 letter words to describe this, but I'll settle for "This is unacceptable". If there isn't such a system, don't let them get to you. Be firm, let them know this is unacceptable politely, and don't loose your cool. 

I'm a forward caste dude. And outside what I eat, and who I'd eventually potentially marry, it has no affect on the real world. I'm a semi practicing bramin. I'm pretty sure there's folks who're probably closer to their own dharma, or a better bramin than me by faith, not birth, and there's a few folks who give us a bad name, and don't even do the basics. Its nothing more than a label in most aspects of life, and a faded one to boot. And well your issues have nothing to do with the caste system. Its plain old corruption and nepotism. Your workplace is toxic and these people use this as an excuse. 

Yes, they are different An online coding test is intended to let the recruiters screen out bad applicants or to rank applicants so they can consider the 'best' ones. It is essentially pass/fail, because you're not able to explain what you're doing to the recruiter. An in-person test is much more interactive; you can explain why you are doing something, or ask for a detail you need but don't have, or ask for clarification of the task or question. In person they are hoping to see your approach, your thought process, rather than just whether you can do a puzzle or not. Don't overcomplicate things If you get a question 'replace all the %20 with space', then just use the built-in function. If they want you to code it by hand, they will say so. Anything that you can do in a simple and straightforward fashion that has not been forbidden is fine. You'd be surprised how many people who apply for coding jobs cannot write code at all. Sometimes they're just asking you a very simple question. In person, investigate the problem Online tests have to be specific about the problem they want you to solve, but in person the interviewer can just make vague requests, like 'can you write code that replaces %20 with spaces' without specifying what inputs to expect. It is worth just checking the parameters of the task; will the code need to cope with arbitrarily long strings, alternate encoding choices, empty strings, etc etc. This is a double-edged sword; you might look good for trying to establish such things before you dive in, but they might just say 'yes' to whether you need to cope with X, so don't skewer yourself with it. 

You're kind of expected to have a certain amount of responsibility in the working world. Actually in the real world, I've rarely, if ever had workplaces with AUPs, and one of them was basically "Don't do anything that would get you in trouble". That said, if you can't access something you shouldn't be. 

Is this the only reason? Is seniority in play? Are there other factors? Any workplace where promotion is not by merit is a little toxic, and politics in most places tends to be more interpercial. To close - the caste system is a relic of a long time ago, and used and abused by politicians and others for their own ends. Its the cause of many social ills and well, not always how you think it is. How bad it is really depends on the state, and unless you want to go into politics, its going to be a hard slog. There's nothing stopping you from creatively using these elements for good. At the end of the day though, if its one man swimming against a tide of filth, it might be a better idea to consider getting a transfer to a more enlightened state. This sounds like one of the worse places to be. 

I concur with Ajaxkevi here, but I would add this: In childhood, much of life is about obligations and duties and doing what you should do. In adulthood, however, you will see that plans and circumstances change, and that expectations of behaviour are more about approach (i.e. being clear and curteous to your boss) and less about about actions. You have not signed a binding contract, nor would one likely be even legal in most countries. You can do your best to keep the relationship with the company positive, and it will probably stay that way. It is worth keeping in mind that if you have been a great employee they won't want to sour the relationship either as you might go back and work there one day. They have no legal or even social right to demand you see out your term, since the circumstances that are causing the change are largely out of your control. As a side note, congratulations on creating a business at any age let alone so young. Success in business often requires you to make hard decisions about honouring vague agreements or not, or about honouring one arrangement over another. As long as you treat people fairly and openly, you will have a clear conscience when you need to give people unfortunate news. 

The CV's meant to get your foot in the door. Personally I put the month of award once its completed (and leave out the dates when it was in progress) , but you could always put May 2010 - June 2014 (Awarded Aug 2014). When the exact details matter, you probably will already be interviewing, and can clear minor stuff like that easily. No one's going to bother if you're a little off, especially where such delays are standard 

Its probably worth looking at both sides of the issue "We follow some ISO standard for security, specifically 27001, from what I can gather" These are generally a pain in the ass requiring much box ticking. Your IT department is probably doing what they are supposed to be doing, and getting in their face about it isn't going to help any. In fact, even looking at the wikipedia makes it clear that its pedantic by design, and I thankfully am not reading through the whole thing for an answer. Spare a thought for the IT guys who actually have to read, understand and implement this! If you're going to have to ask for changes, consider that the decision is probably made higher up, and possibly by less technical folk. You're probably going to have to work out the right person and way to ask, and its as much a political as much as a technical decision. One possibility would be to see if you can get an isolated development/test environment, airgapped from the main network (but once again, this depends on your corporate standards.) Some of these requests may be more feasable than others. 

You have already taken the biggest step, seeking to improve by reviewing what you write. It will improve. Often non-native English speakers know the vocabulary but not the emphasis, so native speakers can struggle to understand - if that is you, use emphasis and vary your tone to show which words are important in your sentence. Speaking clearly and succinctly is a difficult skill to master, so expecting to have the best version in your first draft is a tall order. 

Speak more slowly - give your brain a chance to come up with the right word. Use short sentences - "I have a difficulty to give a right shape of speech to my thoughts or ideas or information that I know in order to express it well." -> "I struggle to express my thoughts clearly" Expand your vocabulary - the right word can replace many: "have a difficulty" -> "struggle" Use simple words - a lot of verbosity is just using complicated words for simple things - "However the difficulty is more in case of verbal communication." -> "But it is worse when speaking". 

I had a resume out while I was studying - what I did was simply leave the finishing date open ended. I've been there. I've gone into an exam needing a 30% score to pass... and got 29%. The marker (who was elsewhere) disagreed with my answer's content, and well, yeah. I retook that module. Its not the end of the world (I got a pretty good score when I retook it!). So, what to say? "I'm currently finishing up my degree and I'm one module away from finishing". Focus on the wins, and what you have to offer to an employer. I'd also add that depending on the job market, its going to take time to find a job, and getting your resume out there pre-graduation is a sensible thing to do. 

I feel your pain, but you need to put some distance between you and your work You work for someone else. It matters to them whether the code they're paying you to build will work, but what should matter to you is whether the time and effort spent is worth the money you are paid. It is not your company, it is not your profit if it works. Your responsibility is to provide the best information you can, and then implement what they decide Management often makes mistakes in deciding what to do. But they are paid to be responsible for those decisions. The best you can do is point out the problems you can foresee, and your misgivings about a particular approach (ideally with reference to decent abstract frameworks like GoF), making sure there is some record in writing that you did so, and then accept whatever decision they do make. Otherwise you risk adding time spent arguing and bad vibes to the situation. If you hide from the project, you are not doing your job They don't pay you to play executioner to their projects, they pay you to press buttons and make the lights blink. If the horse won't go down the road to the asylum, they just shoot that one and get another horse. Don't be that horse. Reframe your activities in terms of what they deliver you Take a minute to write down what you want to get out of your job (and yes, money is one of the things), and what you are currently not getting. Acknowledge where you have opportunities to learn domain knowledge or wisdom from team members, and any niceties of working there. Try to find a path from where you are now to the sunlit uplands you are wishing for; maybe you need more time to learn code architecture skills, so you try to find a way to fit that into your week or your plan. Your current job is just one part of the puzzle, one object in the frame. There are others, there will be other opportunities, there will be other projects. Do the work, even if it will end in the project failing Better that the project fails because of the things you warned of, than that it fails because you stopped trying. Don't sacrifice your private life for it; I would only go those extra miles for inspiring or career-developing projects. Instead, just be a bit more cold and grit your teeth. You're paid to do this, and you are still taking that cheque, so let's get it done with. Spock put his best into a ship filled with emotional humans who made bad decisions, because he was committed to seeing it through Raise your concerns, simply and logically, but if they want to go straight through the asteroid belt, that's on them. Be more Spock.
