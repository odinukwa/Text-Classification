Experiment with your training while keeping your goals in mind. See how your body reacts to different training stimulus whether it's high rep or low rep. There's no reason why you can't do both. And, since you've not indicated any form of cardio work, I'd recommend you look into adding that to your training plan. Then, stick with what provides you the results you want. 

No matter what I, or anyone else recommends, in the end, your decision should be based on your pain tolerance and the risk of further serious injury. At a minimum, you should consult a professional for a proper diagnosis if you haven’t already. Having said all that, I’ve been in your situation while participating in a different sport. I chose the same modalities you have (ice and pain killers), and, it allowed me to compete. I also added stretching before and after my event(s) and made sure to get plenty of rest in between training sessions. In addition, I did find K-Tape helpful, at least psychologically, but, that may be due to the extent of my injury and its location. You may not get the same results. In the end, you’ll need to assess what competing in the event means to you in the context of a potentially chronic injury. Weigh that against taking time off to fully address an injury to prevent it from becoming chronic, and, the ability to race pain free in the future. Only you can make that choice. 

I don't believe there are any studies to show that those particular exercises will help build a “squarer chest” (whatever that may be). However, I think the intent of the advice was to suggest that you should introduce variation into your training routine. From ExRx... 

Sufficient Protein intake is one of the required factors that leads to muscle hypertrophy. The calories from Protein (4 calories/gm), Carbohydrate (4 calories/gm) and Fat (9 calories/gm) all serve as an energy source. The calories are stored as fat when you consume more calories than you expend. In that case, the fat will be retained. 

“itis” type injuries typically result from overuse. The overuse can be caused by poor posture, bad exercise form, and, not enough rest between training the affected muscles to name a few reasons. If you haven't already, you should speak to a Physical Therapist about how to rehab your condition. A physical therapist will be able to determine the root cause of the problem and suggest ways to resolve your condition. 

As a competitive rower, I think I can answer your question. I’m required to use an indoor rower in the “off-season” to improve my cardio fitness. There are several factors to consider when selecting a rowing machine (also Ergometer, or, “erg”). I’ll highlight what you should consider in making your decision and provide my recommendation (I have no affiliation with the company I recommend, but, I do own one of their rowers). First, indoor rowers use different mechanisms to provide resistance. They range from air (fan wheel), piston, water, etc. Each one has its own “feel” with subtle differences. If you can, you should try each rower you are interested in to see how it "fits". Some more easily accommodate the training space where they will be used. For example, most fan wheel types can be stood on end vertically while not being used. I don’t think you’d want to stand the water version on end. You should also consider the support and community that is behind the rower you choose. Does the rower have a large base of users? Does the company provide tools, videos, training to use your rower? These are all things to consider. Now, my recommendation. The recognized leader in the rower industry is Concept2. Their rowers are used by many clubs, colleges and universities. They’re not cheap and only available through Concept2. As of this post, the current price for a new model D rower is $900. However, it’s a machine that’s built to last with features that make using it enjoyable. It comes with a software enable monitor that can provide incentive and the ability to track your progress. Additionally, you can attach a heart monitor (available from Concept2) to it and display your bpm on the progress monitor. The rower can be stored vertically when not in use. I find that important because it takes up less space. The company’s web site provides a portal for you to record your progress and a forum to discuss and meet other users of their machines. Lastly, if you haven’t already, I would recommend you check with your doctor before beginning to use a rower. If you’re interested in the Concetp2 rower, there tend to be used versions available as users upgrade their models. 

To expand on JJosaur's answer, I can personally attest to drug free competitions. I was a drug free competitive bodybuilder, and, I successfully competed locally (in my state) and at locations in the US. The competitions were sanctioned by a specific Natural Bodybuilding organization. The testing typically involved urine and/or lie detector before the event. Granted, it’s not a fool proof method, and things may have changed since I “retired”, but, it was what was used by many organizations. The one thing you must understand is that training drug free is a much more difficult challenge. You must be smarter, and, be prepared to train for many years paying close attention to detail (nutrition, rest, etc.) in order to maximize any potential you may have. 

I began tranining split training 3 months ago, about 4 days a week. I am normally SO SORE after every workout and have been making gains in strength and size. I took about 2 weeks off from the gym and ever since getting back into it... I do not get sore? And I am doing basically the quantity and duration as what ive always done. about 4 exercises with 3 sets per exercise about 10 reps. Yesterday I did a killer ab workout, so many different exercises and even an ab circuit, and trained shoulders pretty hard (which I don't train that often) and feel nothing today? same has been happening lately when I train abs and such? My ab workout is quite lengthy and do incorporate increasing weight to my ab workout.... Am I just getting used to it or do I need to switch up my workout? 

it has protein, carbs, and vegetables and nutritiance! not gaining minimal fat whilst gaining muscle is impossible... don't stress :) per pound of muscle you gain your body burns an extra 80 cal per day... so don't stress about weight just keep lifting and eating big and the weight will sort it self out :) if not go on a cutting phase in a few weeks, 

I have no idea how many calories im meant to be eating a day to lose weight... Some calculators tell me my maintence is 1400, some 1600 and some even 2200! I am female, 141 pounds (63kg), 168cm tall, 19 years old. Have only been lifting for 2-3 months so prob have about 5kg muscle built. (if that's help you determine my body composition) Goal: lose weight, gain muscle Regimine: cardio and weight lift, about 4 times a week, but have been slacking off since cutting as I worry I will just eat away at my muscle by working them out so hard and not feeding them enough? Diet: mainly bread, protein shakes, tuna, yogurt, weight watcher lasagnes, etc. Sometimes smoothies in morn. About 1500 cal. I get enough protein and sleep Could anyone tell me my maintence for training days and non training days? Like non training would it be about 1300? and training days 1600? does that sound right? 

This would be because when your training outdoors or in gym, your heart rate is faster due to your body temperature being so raised, where as when you swim the water keeps your body temp regulated. It is neither good nor bad, it is just what happens. Swimming is an extremely good and beneficial exercise. 

Basically if you are gaining size and not mass that means you are either lacking calories or protein, or not doing a workout strong enough to produce the micro tears and re build. The token amount of protein to have in building muscle is 1g per pound of body weight. I weight 145 pounds, so to build muscle I have to aim for 145. It is very hard to reach this hence many people who train don't grow as much as they would like. Eg cup of milk has 8g, tuna is 18g etc. That is good that you are taking the protein straight after training as after you lift weights there is a 20 monute "window" as they call it where the body acts as sponge and needs protein ASAP. hence a protein shake with about 30g after training is good. Use whey protein for this. Now you know protein lets cover calories. If you are quite a skinny guy it will be VERY hard for you to calculate how many calories you eat and I doubt you want to anyway... Basically unless you have a far bit of body fat.. if you want to gain muscle you have to eat! eat every 3-4 hours with protein based meals. If you want to look at your calorie daily need though for boys is about 2000-3000 and girls about 1500-2200. you can put your name and age and everything into calculations in google and it will figure it out for you. and with the lifting do it so on your 8th or 9th rep you COULD NOT do another rep for your life, feel the burn! and make sure you keep up with your water in take :) hope I could help! If you already are lifting as hard as you can and going up weights every few weeks then your doing fine. when I am not strong enough to go up weights but want a killer workout. I will do this: (say its for biceps- eg bicep curl).. start at absoulute max weight (for me is 7kg- im a girl) I do 5 of them, or even 3 (whatever I can do) then without a break pick up a 5kg weight, do 10 reps then pick up a 3kg weight and do 15 reps. hence the musxcle is under tension a LONG time, and you have varied the rep/weighjt range for muscle confusion and lifted heavier than usual! its called super sets really good for muscle
