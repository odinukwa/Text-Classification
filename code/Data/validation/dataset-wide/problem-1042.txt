Do not think that there is a script for this. It needs to be decided/defined before the data is entered. Otherwise it might block your application from functioning. Normally a table needs 1 field to be unique. Only if you create a table to link 2 different tables (for an N-to-M) relation then you need both the M and the N key to make it unique. There are exceptions but it is up to the designer to decide what field(s) make up the unique key. The data can grow and so can the uniqueness. 

Suppose you want to have the rows that are and . In your first option you get all rows ( for example with all and with all ) and in your second option you only get row 2. 

The COUNT technique that was suggested here should work, but the problem is that your table structure and data mess it up. You did not define any keys, and you have duplicates in the demo data - for example, course 101 enrollment by student 4 appears twice, on the same date, with different grades. Proper declaration of keys would have not allowed it. Changing the predicate to would also give you the result that you were looking for, taking into account that there may be multiple registrations. The generalized problem you are facing is called 'relational division'. Search here and you will find many discussions on the topic. Typically, the most efficient way to solve relational division problems is to use a negative formulation of the question. It seems weird at first, but once you get the hang of it, you can't go back... In your case the question is: 

SQL*Plus is a client that is already available for a very long time. If you use then it does not use the . It connects to the local database that is defined in the environment variable. If you use then it will search in the file to find out the location of the database. 

If your is immutable then it can serve as primary key. Only if it was to hold long values then you could consider to create a separate primary key field to save space in the tables that have a foreign key constraint with this table. 

Do not see the problem. When somebody enters the email address a second time then this happens. Nothing to do with replication. This is what the is used for. If this error would break the replication then I do not understand how replication could ever work. Every user could easily break the replication by, in this case, entering an email address 2 times. I am not an MySQL expert but I think that the doc relates to errors other then maintaining data integrity. Perhaps somebody with more in-depth knowledge of clustering can help you on how to configure master-master clustering. 

There's no way to go wrong and, as @DTest added, this 2 query approach can be faster in some environments (see the link in his comment). Oh, and I took a fast read at MySQL documentation related to Information Functions, there it was on a tiny little silly notice: 

The solution I know for your problem involves two queries. First one will return a list of columns with a given data_type (you can specify the database, and table you want to look for too): 

If it was a smart move or not, it depends of your specific case: If the file location is directly affecting any url structure or if you're storing full file addresses in the database (bad), I can say it was a bad move since you will have trouble in case somebody move or rename some directory. But as But if your application is built in a way you simply have to point the files directory and the file access logic is dynamic, you made a smart move for the following reasons: 

In this trigger you make the ID NULL. When the trigger is finished the insert is done and Postgres will provide an ID. I assume that you have defined the ID as . 

The first field is the primary key. The second and third field make up a unique key. For there is to possible. For I would use for minor, for major, and 'space' for 'normal'. For both those fields you can make a to prevent wrong values to enter. Since there are not many rows in this table it be read completely into memory so it will not influence response times that much. If you do not like the 'extra' primary key then you can also use: 

Create an SQL that does the same as the would do. Remove the rows from the corresponding ~50 tables in the right order before you remove the users. This is some work but it keeps your data safe from an application error that does an accidental remove of a user with (lots of) messages. 

For some reason, MS decided to deprecate the feature, but it still works. See the GROUP BY topic in the documentation. 

You need to be looking at SET Operators. Something along the lines of the following query should do what you are looking for: 

You are using the 3rd normal form. A relation in 3NF, must also be in 2NF and 1NF. You are asking if you need tools to validate your design, which is something no one can answer. If you design a car, will you use available tools to validate that it is safe, fast, and reliable? or will you just trust that your original design achieved these goals without testing it with any tools? 

The technique you are describing for representing task hierarchy is called 'Adjacency list'. Although it is the most intuitive to humans, it doesn't lend itself to very efficient querying in SQL. Other techniques include path enumeration (aka materialized paths) and nested sets. To learn about some other techniques, read this post or search the web for numerous articles on these techniques. SQL Server offers a native hierarchy representation for path enumeration. This is most likely your best bet... 

If you have multiple control files then you can try to copy another one over this corrupted one. Otherwise you need to restore it from an (RMAN) backup. 

So change the DBID and unique name (Check the documentation on these subjects) and check the configuration files of sqlnet (normally in the directory) for references to server A. 

The command should give an output with its parameters and a list of databases that run on this server. Check the directory on the client machine to check if you have a file that has the information to connect to the database. Check it with the command . 

You can create triggers that are fired upon insert/delete/update in the table to write the data you need in a separate history table. You can then later query this table to create your reports. No need to change the application that is now responsible for maintaining the data. 

With the list of column names that satisfy the properties you want (a given data type, in your specific case) all you need to do is a secondary query to select or update data from that list of fields. I searched in MySql documentation and unfortunately there is no way to select or update a dynamic list of fields only with SQL, thats why a secondary generated query is needed. Hope this helps. 

Yes, it's very possible to accomplish that but not with a unique query! First, you need to know where to look for metadata: This kind of information is stored into an internal mysql database called , this database in used only internally by Mysql every time you execute any kind of query involving any database entities. There you will find all sort of meta information about all the tables, columns, privileges, users, triggers of your databases: 

For me the way to go is that you create a pre-insert trigger that will set the for that department when no was given. To get the next you could use a table that holds the last per department. An other way is to get the for that department and add 1 to it. When you work with multiple users then the first solution is better and faster. The primary key for the table would be and perhaps even if you need to start at 1 when the new year starts. 

Take into account that the size you get also contains the empty space that is allocated to the table. When the table was just extended and only 1 new record is written in this extension then the information is less correct. But given the fact that you have nearly 2M of rows per day the space per row will be quite accurate.
