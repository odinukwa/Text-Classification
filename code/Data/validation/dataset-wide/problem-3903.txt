Here is a way to find lots of examples. Suppose that $\Sigma$ is a surface and suppose that $f$ is a periodic mapping class. Let $S$ be the quotient orbifold $\Sigma/f$. Then taking full preimages gives a quasi-isometric embedding of the curve complex of $S$ into the curve complex of $\Sigma$. See arXiv:1104.3492 and arXiv:math/0701719 for two different proofs. When $S$ has an infinite diameter curve complex we can pick $a$ and $b$, curves in $S$, that are as well separated as you want. Then the preimages $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are also well separated, and fixed as simplices by $f$. A bit more work (which I haven't done) should give examples where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are single vertices. There are also examples where $S$ is honestly a surface, not just an orbifold. 

Ian Agol, in his 03/04/03 blog states (claims?) that minimal surfaces propagate backwards under the Ricci flow. Hmmm. Ok, in 05/19/03 he gives more details, using CMC collars. I confess that I can't follow the argument in detail. Also, it's not obvious that this would suffice to answer: 

The original question was "Is there an algorithm that, given two genus g Heegaard splittings, decides if the resulting two manifolds are homeomorphic?" The answer to this question is "yes" but doesn't have anything to do with Heegaard splittings. In theory the solution to the Geometrization Conjecture gives an algorithm to decide if two manifolds are homeomorphic. In practice one converts the splitting to a triangulations and feeds the result to SnapPy. There are several other programs for three-manifold recognition, such as snap, orb, Regina, and the 3-Manifold Recognizer. However all use SnapPea as the engine for dealing with hyperbolic manifolds. See $URL$ for links. The Recognizer, for Windows, can be found at $URL$ 

The classification of once-punctured torus bundles over $S^1$ with Heegaard genus two should follow directly from a paper of Cooper and Scharlemann. Jesse's paper (above) uses similar techniques but deals with general genus fiber (harder!). Thinking about Ian's outermost disk suggestions is probably a good idea. 

Following Gordon's corollary "For every problem you can't solve, there is an easier problem you also can't solve" let me suggest two easier problems. Suppose that P is the hyperbolic paraboloid solving $z = xy$. 1) Find a pair of points $A, B \in P$ so that the geodesic between them is not contained in a vertical plane. Perhaps $A = (1,0,0)$ and $B = (0,1,0)$ will work? 2) Find a pair of points $A, B \in P$ so that the geodesic between them is not contained in a plane. The motivation here is that geodesics in the sphere (and on the hyperboloid with a "nice" metric) are intersections of the sphere with planes through the origin. 

the map from $\pi_1(T) \to \pi_1(X)$ has kernel and the curve that dies ($\partial E$) meets the meridian $(\partial D$) exactly once. 

Prickly pear cactus is very pretty. Lots of cut points! I believe that that your cacti are "tree-graded spaces" where are "pieces" are points or disks. See Drutu, C., Sapir, M.: Tree-graded spaces and asymptotic cones of groups. Topology 44, 959â€“1058 (2005). 

Nice question! I don't know of such a census. Probably the first course of action is to email Damien Heard, the author of the program "Orb". Here is the page for Orb. $URL$ The documentation, a 13 page pdf file in the source code archive, is very helpful. Basically, you want to draw a theta-graph, drill one of the edges, and label each of the other edges with a "2". These graphs are in one-to-one correspondence with tangles (well, up to a Dehn twist about the equator of the tangle). Orb can find canonical triangulations for these and can, it appears, use them to check for isometries. This, in addition to its ability to compute volumes and length spectra, means it can deal with the filtering side of census building. Orb can also compute two-fold branched covers, which will be handy. I guess some version of DT codes will deal with the generation side of census building. Needless to say, this sounds like a non-trivial amount of work... Postscript: I'd be very interested to see how the two-fold branched covers of tangles arrange themselves in the SnapPea cusped census. Is there a way to directly "see" which elements of the cusped census have tangle quotients? 

The Riemann sphere isn't conformally equivalent to the others because it is not homeomorphic to them. :) 

Let $d_1$ be the first arc $h$ crosses, and let $d_2$ be the second. So $d_1$ is the diagonal of $Q$, and $d_1$ will be flipped to $d_1'$. After the flip, the first arc that $h$ meets is $d_2$. So the intersections of $h$ and $d_2$ are not counted. Thus $i(\delta',\{h\}) \leq i(\delta,\{h\}) - 1$, as desired. 

To be more precise, I am teaching a short course on homology, from chapter two of Hatcher's book. Before diving into the details of Delta-complexes, good pairs, long exact sequences, degrees, and so on, I would like to present a collection of real-life phenomena that are greatly illuminated by actually knowing homology theory. Ideally, I would refer back to these examples as the course progressed and explain them with the new tools the students learn. Here is what I have thought of so far. 

Sometimes a slick solution can be found using the braid relation and its generalization, the "chain relation". In your comment, it sounds like you are drawing the surface in $\RR^3$ and the periodic element $\phi$ is induced by a rotation of $\RR^3$, so I will just point out the following nice fact, given as an exercise in Thurston's book: not every periodic element is induced by a symmetric embedding of the surface into $\RR^3$. Consider the element of order six in the mapping class group of the torus... 

If C is a cube of sidelength $\sqrt{2}$ centered at the origin then we can place the $v_i$ at the midpoints of the twelve edges. Taking the convex hull of the $v_i$ gives a cube-octahedron of edge-length one. See here for a picture. If you cut the cubeoctahedron along a hexagonal equator and rotate the top half by sixty degrees you get another polyhedron. Both of these have 24 edges. Are these the unique maximal solutions to the above problem? Notice that if you place the $v_i$ at the arguably nicer vertices of a icosahedron then the $v_i$ become too widely separated. It is easy to check this by making a physical model! I spent some time thinking about areas of spherical polygons and restrictions on the graph of edges (and its dual graph) coming from the Euler characteristic. However, I don't think I got very far - in particular ruling out pentagons seems to be a crucial point that I couldn't deal with. Finally, to explain the problem title: instead of thinking of unit vectors with spacing restrictions, consider the (equivalent) problem of placing twelve identical spherical caps, of radius $\pi/12$, on the unit sphere with disjoint interiors in such a way as to maximize the number of points of tangency. This question was asked of me by an applied mathematician. It comes from a problem involving packing balls in three-space, minimizing some quantity that is computed by knowing pairwise distances. The solution to the kissing problem thus justifies the "twelve" appearing in the problem statement. The projection of surrounding balls to a central one gives the spherical caps. 

A homeomorphism (of surfaces) is isotopic to a PL homeomorphism. See Theorem A4 of Epstein's "Curves on 2-manifolds and isotopies". He gives a proof. I haven't read the paper recently, but I recall that it is fairly self-contained. 

Thurston only claims a classification of knots, not of links. See Corollary 2.5 of Thurston's article "Three dimensional manifolds, kleinian groups, and hyperbolic geometry". Cromwell's statement is incorrect, as your examples show. However, your examples are almost the only ones that he does not cover. The correct statement for links is as follows: Every link complement in the three-sphere is either hyperbolic, toroidal (that is, satellite), or Seifert fibered. In the last case, we can obtain a lot of control over the base orbifold; it is either a disk with two orbifold points (giving a torus knot), an annulus with one orbifold point (your examples), or a pair of pants. 

Scott explicitly claims that Fuchsian groups are LERF on the first page of his paper. Lemma 1.4 shows that LERF is equivalent to the "geometric condition". He assumes the cover is regular, but I think the proof goes through for a regular orbifold cover. Thus Fuchsian groups also have the "geometric condition". Finally, orbifolds (with finitely generated orbifold fundamental group) have compact cores, completing the proof. NB: There is an erratum for this paper, published in 1985. 

A) Multiplication (of $n$--bit numbers) obviously takes longer than addition. B) Sorting $n$ objects obviously takes longer than linear time. (I suppose that this is obvious because it is true: there is a lower bound of $n \log n$ for comparison-based sorts. However, radix sort of integers can be faster. In fact, for any collection (of a particular type of object), there just might be a super clever way to sort it faster than $n \log n$....) 

Dehn's proof that the mapping class group is finitely generated by twists, in 1938, was independently discovered (and simplified) by Lickorish in 1962 and 1964. Dehn's coordinates for curves on surfaces, also in 1938, was rediscovered by Thurston (and greatly extended) in 1988. In all cases I've give the publication dates; the relevant mathematics was being publicized earlier: at least 1922 for Dehn and 1976 for Thurston. But Dehn's work was interrupted by two world wars... See Stillwell's remarks in his collected translations "Papers on group theory and topology". 

Since $N$ is compact, $S - N$ is not compact. In particular $S - N$ is homeomorphic to a punctured surface: here a punctured surface is a compact surface without boundary minus a finite set of points. It may help to copy out their definitions word-by-word. Then find an example for each definition. 

After your paper is accepted, you should politely ask the publisher for a version of the copyright form that either a) places the paper in the public domain or b) allows you to retain copyright. In my experience, a) sometimes works and b) always works. 

Your question is explicitly answered in Section 6 of Thurston's Bulletin article, freely available here. In the end it boils down to a calculation in $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$. 

Here is another thought that struck me on the way home, that I should have realized earlier. Suppose that $S$ is a closed hyperbolic surface, of genus $g$. Then the area of $S$ is $-2\pi\chi(S) = 2\pi(2g - 2)$. Since the area of a disk in the hyperbolic plane is exponential in its radius, it follows that the diameter of $S$ is at least logarithmic in $g$. The mixing time of a space has to be at least the diameter, right? So this gives a uniform lower bound on the mixing time. Thurston's comment is pointing out that there is no uniform upper bound. To see this: The injectivity radius is one-half the systole (the length of the shortest closed geodesic). For a hyperbolic surface, the collar lemma implies that as the injectivity radius goes to zero the diameter goes to infinity (this is the previously mentioned "long thin tube"). Thus the mixing time also has to grow, by the previous paragraph. I roughly expect the mixing time can be estimated from the logarithm of the genus and the inverse of the injectivity radius. One reference for the geometric facts above is Peter Buser's book "Geometry and spectra of compact Riemann surfaces".
