If the day is so long then also plants need to "emigrate" somehow (even if just burying underground till the ice will thaw). Agricultural revolution is not the real propulsion of bronze-age culture, bronze-age came along because populations become sedentary (agriculture encouraged this). You can stipulate large underground caves where volcanic activity keeps conditions stable year-around (I should say "day-around :) ) and have there communities of artisans waiting for customers at dawn, doing some agriculture during the day and burying deep in their workshops at night. It is a bit difficult to manage because You need provisions for several years, but you have a "natural freezer" in the caves near to the surface. Light would be even more difficult to provide, unless you invent something like luminescent plants adapted to the warm caves. Other possibility is to make the populace waterborne and have a fleet sailing toward the sun. It doesn't need to be very fast, so it can be primitive rafts, even large ones. If they are sailing at the right latitude they could even take advantage of winds and currents for push (trade winds come to mind). Large enough rafts would support sizeable factories and raw materials could be gathered along the cost. You can even combine the two and add a fleet of "fast rafts" speeding towards the morning, settling down doing gathering/agriculture waiting for the main fleet, packing everything there and racing ahead again. Something could be left beyond to be used "tomorrow" (mostly stone buildings, wood wouldn't last without maintenance, probably). Whatever is needed for metallurgy is difficult to attain in a constantly moving world. 

Artificial materials are usually obtained through processes very different from organic ones. In our factories we routinely use pressures and temperatures incompatible with organic life. Incidentally this is also the reason why a vast majority of artificial substances cannot be metabolized and broken down by ecosystem. Some of these substances could conceivably be built via enzymatic anabolism, but surely not all. Probably growing carbon fibers would be easier than Kevlar and also better suited to the task at hand (carbon composites are much more rigid than Kevlar ones and You don't need high tensile strength in bones. 

Much depends on actual contraption topology, but, given the info we have, there is a strategy that might work: 

You need to detail a bit better. No military installation relies on "normal" power stations. They have local and not-so-local backups to last for long time. In war-like-conditions power plants are a primary target, even forgetting about aliens. If Aliens destroyed everything, including backups and backup-of-backups then the Western world would have a lot of problems even without "commies" help. Assuming Eastern world is not touched by Alien retaliation they would be very welcome to invade Europe and thus save quite a bit of lives. Even in 70's no western nation would survive a prolonged and generalized loss of power. OTOH destruction of "regular civilian power stations", leaving backups fully functional, might be survived and have small immediate impact on military capabilities; of course rebuilding all power installations would be a major setback exposing Western world to a mid-term vulnerability which may be exploited from East. Main vulnerability would come from (forced) usage of military backups to power civilian apparatus, depleting military redundancy. 

As quite often, if not always, is the case, the answer is: "it depends". First variable is the position of such a sphere with respect to planet, second is if it's complete or not, third it's albedo (there are others like planet's atmosphere, but let's assume it's like Earth's): 

First approach has proved either too crude (forecasts are reasonably precise for next 24 hours, no more) or too expensive (even with current supercomputers simulation takes almost the same time as "real" time). Second approach worked much better (it is what almost all commercial forecasts use), but it is currently failing more and more often because weather patterns are changing (due to Global Warming and other effects) and thus the "old ways" are not reliable anymore and the method is unable to adjust fast enough. To come back to Your question: even stashing, for the sake of argument, all objections people will have because they do not want Government to do the "right" thing as they want it to do what's their interest (i.e.: they want their chance to to do "lobbying") instead, there remains a series of fundamental issues: 

Dogs larynx doesn't have the flexibility needed to emit proper phonemes. You have then two, possibly combined, approaches: 

Much easier with the "Saharan flask" a normal bottle covered with something absorbing (usually rough cloth) soaked with water and left in broad sunlight. Water evaporation cools bottle content. If You really want to go technological You need solar cells to provide power, some way (e.g.: Peltier effect) to extract heat and some radiant fins to dispose of it. Note: You don't "infuse" solar cells in anything, you can "place" them arount someth. or "etch" them on someth. surface. 

I think a blimp of that size could be done, but I do not see any way to have it stand against upper atmosphere winds. This behemoth should be relatively flat and, if round, it would have a diameter exceeding 11km; giving it a (very conservative) height of mere 100m you end up with a cross-section exceeding 1km2. To remain static against winds would require enormous power. OTOH, given the enormous dimensions and fact you don't really need a rigid structure I think it could be done without special gasses, an old-fashioned hot-air balloon could suffice, probably with just solar power; During the night it would loose a bit, but not enough to really drop and next morning sunshine should be in position to restore lost heat (this in the hypothesis we are able to take advantage of the square/cube law and thus have a huge mass of hot air which can lose heat through a (relatively) small surface (i.e.: do not make your balloon too flat) which is also what weighs down (i.e.: the structure is relatively lighter than equivalent smaller installations, so you need air "less hot"). I also am not real sure about effectiveness of such a beast as sun-shield because I think it is too small (by orders of magnitude) to have a real effect on climate, but I might be wrong. 

Whenever one of the Dryads is ready for "marriage" (whatever form You want to explain to a 7-year old child ;) ) we will have a huge tournament to chose the "husband". Dryads would be willing to abide to the winner, but would sneer to any "unchivalrous" attitude. You can have your battles with the shiniest armors and weapons with as little actual spilled blood as possible (essentially just the inevitable mistakes). You can have further variations on the theme having the two main races to prove their warriorship before marriage with a woman of his own race or stipulating some need of "blood exchange", if single-sex Nations are too far-fetched for your needs. Mixing of the two: In order to marry both Elves and Dwarfs need to gift to their beloved maiden a rare flower and so a siege is in act where the plant is about to blossom, but, since maidens from above and below will be watching, warriors need to play fair. 

This, of course, if there's nothing in the vicinity; neutron stars that are part of a double-star system exhibit a vast range of "interesting" behavior like accretion by stealing matter to its companion. 

Because all operations in given environment are very important and need careful setting. It is much easier to click on the wrong icon than to input a syntactically correct command that's not what intended. "Command Line" is much harder to learn and thus the popularity of "GUI" interfaces, but in the given environment that's not a problem as your "small-scale entrepreneurs" are bound to know their ships very well and are likely to welcome anything forcing them to think before committing a command. In the example given they surely won't like "oversleep" any important (orbital) appointment. Edit: I know this is a very slippery subject and many Holy Wars have been fought under the flags of GUI Fawkes and CLI_nt Eastwood, but I will clarify my thoughts nonetheless. Bear with me. The trend in general and about Interfaces in particular, has always been to make things "easier" for the user. This is generally regarded as a Good Thing, but, as with everything, there is a price to pay and situations where this price overweight any advantage had. The specific "price", in the case of Interfaces is that an "easy one" requires less thought and thus can be used while distracted, sleepy, inebriated or otherwise not fully focused on the task. A special note, here, should be done about Unix CLI: Usage of short commands (mostly 2 letters, 3 if clashing) and single letter options was essentially chosen to "avoid too much typing" (and because of limited parsing capabilities in the late 70's, of course). Thus it already is on the path of "making life easier" for users. The "small-scale entrepreneurs" cited in the OP are bound to be very skilled people caring little about easiness and having all the time in the Universe to do the things "right". To them a "punitive" interface, requiring precise and redundant input, is a boon. The cited example would be modified in: 

Your question actually has several underlying (and still unanswered) questions. The main one is: "Can we state in an unambiguous way what a Government should do?" Another, more fundamental and still open to "philosophical" debate, is: "Will computers ever be able to cope with situations unforeseen at time of their building?" Today's computers are mainly geared toward two diverging schemes: Algorithmic and Pattern Recognition. Take, for example, one of the "though" problems currently handled by computers: weather forecast. There are two "schools": 

It all depends on what you mean by "glitch". If you mean an error of programming then the answer is, as others have rightly said, a resounding "NO". Reason for this is that "this specific programming" is reality, so any (possible??) "error" in it is a "law of Nature" and not a mistake (yes sir: this is not a bug, it's a feature!). If you look at it in this way then the specific programming of any (even the buggiest) game is what actually defines that world, so "glitch" assumes a different meaning: an unexpected result of some action (i.e.: experiment) obeying to "laws" not yet discovered. In this meaning history of Science is full of "strange glitches", from the famous Michelson-Morley experiment to quantum effects that allow your PC to work. What would be different in finding a wormhole connecting two different points in space (unlikely, but not ruled out by current scientific knowledge) and your "using a plate to penetrate a wall"? Only difference is in our expectations: we know our reality still has undiscovered aspects while you pretend to know what's "right" in a game. 

There never was a "religious war" without an economic motivation. Fighters, often fight for religious or otherwise "moral" reasons, but the ones with power to start a war usually have a more solid motivation. Almost all modern nations have (often sizable) "minorities" belonging to a different faith, but they mostly live together peacefully (unless there's some economic motivation, real or narrated). This actually is a non-question: please look deeper and you'll smell either money or power in each and any "warlike" conflict. 

Bigger submarines are for longer missions. Submarines are thought for stealth, big and stealth do not go well together. The only sensible reason to make bigger ones is to stuff into them more weaponry and recycling equipment to allow remaining deep and quiet through the rough moments and strike back with enough power. In general nuclear submarines (nuclear in both power and weapons) are much bigger than "conventional" ones. You need much more space to hold the nuclear reactor and you need to transport a sizable amount of ICBMs. To that You need to add space for "enhanced" technical staff. Again: in submarines big is for longer time underwater. 

The fundamental problem in your schema are scales, which are difficult to justify even as a regression. Justification of coexistence of vipers and mermaids could "simply" be vipers are "incomplete mermaids"; i mean: men in aquatic environment (many rather close small islands in rather deep sea) evolved in vipers and when population growth forced them to remain waterborne almost continuously first developed a membrane between the legs an then fused them together getting a dolphin-like tail (but powered by legs and not tail muscles). In any case fins cetacean-style are much easier to justify than fish-like (spiky) fins. Also real gills are difficult to justify; apnea-enhancements (again, cetacean-style) would be more likely.
