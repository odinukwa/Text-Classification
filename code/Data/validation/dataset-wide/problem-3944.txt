Let me try to add a different point of view on B-fields and mirror symmetry. Ideally in mirror symmetry, given a Calabi-Yau manifold X, you would like to "construct" its mirror X', where the symplectic form on X should give you the complex structure on X'. As already mentioned, classes of symplectic forms have moduli of real dimension $h^{1,1}(X)$ and complex structures on X' have moduli of complex dimension $h^{2,1}(X') = h^{1,1}(X)$. So the kahler class is not enough to determine all complex structures on X'. In the context of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture there is a nice interpretation of the B-field. Suppose X = $T^*B / \Lambda$, where B is a smooth manifold and $\Lambda$ is locally the span over the integers of 1-forms $dy_1$, ..., $dy_n$ (here $y_1$, ..., $y_n$ are coordinates which change with affine transformations from one chart to the other). Then $X$ has a standard symplectic form. We can consider $X'= TB / \Lambda'$, where $\Lambda'$ is the dual lattice. Then X' has a natural complex structure defined as follows. In standard coordinates on TB, given by $(y,x)$ --> $x \partial_y$, the complex coordinates on X' are $z_k = e^{2\pi i(x_k + i y_k)}$, which are well defined due to the nature of the coordinates x and y. But the above complex coordinates can be twisted locally (on a coordinate patch) by $z_k (b) = e^{2\pi i(x_k + b_k + i y_k)}$, where $b = (b_1, \ldots, b_n)$ is some local data. But since on overlaps $U_i \cap U_j$ the coordinates have to match, we must have $b(i) - b(j) \in \Lambda$. It turns out that by putting $b_{ij} = b(i) - b(j)$ on overlaps, we get a cohomology class in $H^{1}(B, \Lambda)$, this is the B-field. The cohomology group $H^{1}(B, \Lambda)$ shoud coincide (in some cases at least) with $H^2(X, R/Z)$, which is what Kevin Lin mentioned. The elliptic curve case (mentioned by Kevin) can be seen from this point of view. This point of view is also called "mirror symmetry without corrections" and it only approximates what happens in compact Calabi-Yaus. I have learned this in papers by Mark Gross (such as "Special lagrangian fibrations II: geometry") or the book "Calabi-Yau manifolds and related geometries" by Gross, Huybrechts and Joyce. I would be interested to know how this interpretation connects to the other ones which have been described. 

Basically this is Lefschetz duality. Chopping out the neighbourhood of the 2-sphere gives a 4-manifold $X$ with boundary $Y = S^2 \times S^1$. You can think about the intersection form here and how this will change after the surgery. The point of $S^2$ being null-homologous is that if you look at the long exact sequence on homology (say) of the pair $(X,Y)$ you will see that every element of $H_2(X,Y)$ is represented by a unique element of $H_2(X)$. I think it's necessary that the $S^2$ be null-homologous, I would imagine that otherwise, a priori, the intersection form may change. 

The 1D result is discussed in detail here: 1607.06766. (See also 1607.06504.) The analog of the TVBW invariant is the FHK state sum, which takes as input a separable algebra $A$. As Kevin points out, this algebra has an interpretation as the space of states on the interval with some boundary conditions. The algebra has a canonical special symmetric Frobenius form, which is used to build the invariant. Not all 2d TQFTs, which are classified by commutative Frobenius algebras, have an FHK state sum; but up to deformation (appropriate for gapped phases), they all do. The construction is also redundant, as the TQFT only senses the Morita class of $A$. In particular, the space of states on the circle (the vector space underlying the commutative Frobenius algebra) is the center of $A$. The analog of the LW model is the fixed-point Matrix Product State (MPS) system, which also takes as input a separable algebra. It consists of a parent Hamiltonian, whose ground states are have a simple wavefunction representation called MPS. For each module $V$ over $A$, there is a ground state $\vert\psi_V\rangle$ on the circle; the space of ground states is spanned by the indecomposable modules. Therefore, as was the case for the TQFT, the space of ground states is the center of the separable algebra $A$. The correspondence is made more explicit by extending the state sum to incorporate physical (brane) boundaries. These are associated to modules $V$ over $A$. If one evaluates the state sum for the anulus with boundary condition $V$ on one boundary circle and outgoing cut boundary on the other, one obtains the MPS state $\vert\psi_V\rangle\in A^{\otimes N}$ before projecting to the TQFT state space (the center of $A$). The parent Hamiltonian arises as the projector assigned to the cylinder. I agree with Kevin's opinion that the 1D result only becomes interesting when new structure is added. This is due to the trivial algebra $\mathbb{C}$ being the only indecomposable separable algebra in $\text{Vect}$. See the references above for systems with finite group actions. There, one works with separable algebras in $\text{Rep}(G)$ and has a Morita class of algebras for each pair $(H,\omega)$, an unbroken symmetry group and a cocycle characterizing the SPT order. For the correspondence between 1D fermionic systems and field theories that are sensitive to spin structure, see 1610.10075. 

This is something I just heard about yesterday. In this article Nodal quintics in P^4. B. van Geemen and J. Werner In: Arithmetic of Complex Manifolds; W.-P. Barth, H. Lange Eds. Springer LNM 1399, (1989) 48-59. (find a copy here: $URL$ the authors compute the Betti numbers of certain smooth complex Calabi-Yau manifolds using a combination of techniques from algebraic topology and number theory. If I understand they first reduce the equations to some finite field, then combining the use of etale cohomology, the Lefschetz fixed point theorem and other things they reduce the problem to counting a finite set of points. 

I wanted to give a somewhat "low-tech" answer to this, here's the best I came up with: Call the curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ and the surface that they lie in $\Sigma$. Take a small open neighborhood $N$ of $C_1 \cup C_2$. What does $N$ look like? Well, it's a neighborhood of $C_1$ stuck to a neighborhood of $C_2$ in an operation called a "plumbing" (which is the same operation as sticking together two strips of paper to make a cross). The neighborhood of $C_i$ is a cylinder that has been plumbed to itself a few times (one plumbing for each self-intersection of $C_i$). Now if $C_1$ can be homotoped to coincide with $C_2$ inside $\Sigma$ then it can be homotoped to $C_2$ inside the space $S$ that I make by crushing $\Sigma \setminus N$ to a point. The idea is to convince yourself that $S$ is a torus with a finite number of points identified (one point for each boundary circle of $N$), and that $C_1$ wraps once around one direction of the torus while $C_2$ wraps once around the transverse direction. 

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a monoidal category. There is a notion of Morita equivalence of algebra objects internal to $\mathcal{C}$. Does each Morita class have a symmetric Frobenius representative? A Hopf representative? Following arXiv:math/0111139, suppose $\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple and rigid with finitely many irreducible objects and irreducible unit. Each indecomposable semisimple module category over $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to one of the form $\text{Mod}_\mathcal{C}A$ for some algebra object $A$ internal to $\mathcal{C}$; such algebras are called indecomposable semisimple, and their Morita classes are in bijective correspondence with such module categories. In this language, my question is whether, given such a module category $\mathcal{M}$ over $\mathcal{C}$, there is a symmetric Frobenius (or Hopf) algebra object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that $\text{Mod}_\mathcal{C}A$ is equivalent to $\mathcal{M}$. If not, are there conditions on $\mathcal{C}$ under which $A$ exists? 

Here's a way to get different gluing maps giving the same glued-up manifold. There's an annulus embedded in M that meets each boundary in a closed curve (on the outer torus $T_1$ this closed curve runs twice around the longitudinal direction). There's a self-diffeomorphism of $M$ supported near the annulus that restricts to a Dehn twist $D_1$ on the closed curve in $T_1$ and to a Dehn twist $D_2$ on the closed curve on $T_2$. It follows that if $f : T_1 \rightarrow T_2$ is a gluing map, then for $f' = D_2 \circ f \circ D_1^{-1}$ we have $M_f = M_{f'}$. 

Let $\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv}$ denote the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-module defined by the inversion action on $\mathbb{Z}$. Let $G_0$ be a finite group that acts trivially on $\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv}$. Then one can compute via the KÃ¼nneth Theorem and UCT for cohomology,\begin{align}H^3(G_0\times\mathbb{Z}/2;\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv})&=\text{Tor}(H^3(G_0;\mathbb{Z}),\mathbb{Z}/2)\times H^2(G_0;\mathbb{Z})\otimes_\mathbb{Z}\mathbb{Z}/2\times \mathbb{Z}/2\\&=H^2(G_0;\mathbb{Z}/2)\times \mathbb{Z}/2.\end{align}We find that every non-zero element in the cohomology group is of order $2$. Now let $G_0\rightarrow G\xrightarrow{x} \mathbb{Z}/2$ be a possibly non-trivial extension of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ by $G_0$. A $G$-action on $\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv}$ is defined by $g:n\mapsto (-1)^{x(g)}n$. Is it true that every non-zero element in $H^3(G;\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv})$ is of order $2$? 

Let $BG$ denote the classifying space of a finite group $G$. For which group cohomology classes $c\in H^2(G;\mathbb{Z}/2)$ does there exist a real vector bundle $E$ over $BG$ such that $w_2(E)=c$?
