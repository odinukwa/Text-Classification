Odds are it ends up being a combination of the options I listed, or even the myriad of other options I did not list out. I should also mention I love the idea of a space armada where the king is in a gargantuan capital ship, the Dukes are in cruisers, the Barons in Carriers, and the knights fly around in large interceptors. Meanwhile the grunts are stuck flying in fighters...each unit has their boss' coat of arms painted on their craft...very cool mental image. 

If you're looking for longevity the arctic or a desert are obviously the way to go. That said there are many old buildings that still exist in temperate and tropical climates. Here is a list of really old buildings. As you can see, the majority show up in the desert, moisture and temperature change are bad for preservation. There are examples from the rest of the world as well though. If you are looking to have a relatively intact series of ruins that is perfectly plausible even in your forest. As an example I would point to the Chichen Itza. The complex/city has existed for about the amount of time you are looking at and is in perhaps the only environment worse for preservation than a deciduous forest...that being a tropical rain forest. When it was found there were trees literally growing out of the tops of some of the stone structures. 

This method keeps you on task and helps avoid wasting time on superfluous information as you follow the items most important to your effort down to the level of detail necessary You can do this multiple times, if you want to do something like the one above and then do it again for something more specific, like a continent, or a nation a city, or heck if you need the detail even a single person (your main character perhaps). How spread out? How many years have passed between major events is important to consider. In the example I used lets the author wants the population to think the destroyers are myths to scare people, well you are going to need lots of time (note the higher the technology level the more time will need to pass between events) 

The obvious example that comes to mind would be Forgotten Realms (D&D) ...they have A LOT of gods and they vary in how they treat the world and their followers. It is easy to imagine a city in Forgotten Realms, maybe Waterdeep (a large metropolis) where there are no laws regarding worship. People are free to worship any deity they choose and the deities can fall anywhere on the 9 point alignment axis. 

This is an interesting question but the premise has some flaws. As others have mentioned resources are an issue. This is true for both the attackers AND the defenders. Defenders 

Some depth. Bullets 1 and 2 go together. For a geo-political entity to be this specialized it first needs to be small, particularly in a medieval setting where surpluses of essentials were not the norm. To realize this group of specialists the surrounding nations will need to support Artlandia with food, raw materials, protection...basically everything. This means the surrounding lands need to be fairly wealthy because no one purchases art if they are struggling to eat. By non-traditional power I mean non-military power. The city could be a banking hub, religious center or perhaps they have technology that keeps potential attackers at bay. The most obvious real world example that comes to mind is Vatican City...now its not an exact parallel because the pope had his own army for a good portion of the middle ages, but it is close. Essentially with this line item I am telling you there needs to be a reason that surrounding nations do not just annex the city since it is poorly protected. I think the most realistic scenario is that the city is the center of a hierarchical world religion. That way you have a single religious figure that can help keep the surrounding nations at bay. At the same time making the city a center of learning may afford them some technological protection as well. Maybe they have some ridiculous weapons that the surrounding nations can't compete with. If you throw being a neutral banking hub on top of that it doesn't hurt either. The last bullet simply reinforces a point you made about what is considered 'art'. If you include only the traditional arts, painting, sculpting etc then...no you are going to struggle. If you include religious, education and scientific institutions in your nation you bring much more variety and can bring money in from outside the country in the form of students, travelers, merchants etc. During a time of relative prosperity for the region this seems like it should be a viable scenario, maybe not completely practical...by workable. If things go downhill though...it probably ends badly for the city's independence. Keep in mind a city of artists can't actually function. You will still need all the basic services of a city met. That means you will have services workers, inns, street cleaners, gardeners, sanitation workers, basically all the stuff that makes a city function still has to be there. It may be better to consider your city a Seat of Learning rather than a nation of artists and if the city is that well off it is going to be difficult to keep people with other specialties from moving in to enjoy in the prosperity...it takes a lot to run a city day to day and that would all have to be present even if you don't have city farms or a standing army. 

It is important at this point to differentiate between legal freedom and complete freedom. Much like the second amendment and freedom of speech, you are protected from government punishment based solely on what you say...but as pointed out, that does not protect you from the implications of obnoxious things you might say and how other people feel about your opinions. I would suggest that freedom of religion in this sort of world would work much the same way. Sure you are free to worship the chaotic evil god of murder if you want to...but doing so in public could end very very poorly for you, even if it is not the government that is making things end that way. Odds are there would be cultural norms for a given city where a certain set of gods is preferred, there would be a second layer of gods that while not common are not overtly frowned upon (maybe foreign deities or the deities of minority races) and then there would be the third layer of hated, feared, evil deities that are only worshipped in secret. You may not have the city guard executing mid-night raids but you could very well have mobs that take matters into their own hands...which the government may or may not tolerate. 

A lone mountain on a plain is powerful visual setup and one I would like to use in my world. My concern at this point is that I don't want this location to be volcanically active, now or in the past. Is it possible for such a mountain to come into existence without volcanic activity? Any combination of other scientifically accurate, non-man made options, can be used to get there. 

But this is sort of a cop out and doesn't really address the problem you are trying to solve, which in my mind is Can I have a major religion with varied adherents profess and maintain non-violence? 

As the title suggests, what happens to a planet geologically and geographically over time? This question came to mind from the many sessions of Civilization I have played where when you set up a custom game, "World Age", measured in I want to say millions of years, is an option. But this got me thinking what are the impacts of age on a planet? For this exercise lets assume we are talking about an earth-like world that was created and stable (supporting human life) from year 0. The world I am working on is roughly 5000 years old (that is how much timeline I have developed) and in my head it appears much the same that the earth does today. Does my world that has 5000 years of developed timeline need to change to fit the realities of a younger world? What would that look like? 

I never thought to say this but the answer is socialism. Better yet, a socialism that has the potential to actually work. Here are the points for my reasoning. 

Your problem isn't going to be finding enough people to break the global peace, its going to be finding enough people to make breaking the peace a problem in the first place. To reiterate. Humans are naturally inclined to separate themselves and in many situations be selfish...its part of our evolution. Sure we sometimes fight it but... You should read up on the concept of relative deprivation as it pertains to political science. It may help you set up your scenario. 

So...how are we going to fare against these aliens. Poorly, especially at first. The first few years (if the aliens take that long to fight us) are going to be very...very bad. It takes a lot of time to develop a military infrastructure. Factories have to be built, bases have to be built, people have to be recruited and trained, weapons have to be mass produced...and keep in mind this isn't the middle ages, you can't just hand a guy a spear and say "Pointy end goes that way" Training pilots takes 3-5 years, advanced weapons systems can take months, tanks take a while as well. The inclusion of ancestral guidance would be helpful in training and operations. If nothing else it provides a baseline and can help in the creation of training programs, but if tech advanced over five hundred years you are starting from scratch on weapons training. 

Final Thoughts: This application could potentially have localized impacts and ignite discussions about the positive or more likely negative impacts on society, but frankly that already happens with Tinder... But that already happens today. Odds are, given your scenario the impacts would be slightly larger but the type of problem would be the same and the global increase in impact would be minimal. Finally I would reference this xkcd comic which makes things nice and simple. 

The best choices here are actually not going to be that exciting but there are many options around the globe for transportation/pack animals. Around the globe, you have camels, donkeys, llamas, oxen, reindeer, elephants and water buffaloes. Some potential options that I don't think have been done before are american bison, Elk, and moose. The idea of a rhinoceros is appealing though generally against their nature as they tend to be edgy...but a rhino cavalry charge would be fantastic. 

The reasons part gets complicated... Perspective is notoriously fickle. From the view of Taiwan, China is the aggressor. From the Chinese perspective the Taiwanese are rebels. You will have to define this perspective. Once defined you can review and pull in the methods that make sense for your scenario. None of the methods are inherently evil. 

On the other hand if we look at a totally different sentient species that evolved differently than humans it should be possible. Humans evolved in a darwinian system that favored aggressive behavior. If you can ensure that the species evolved in a less competitive environment (it would take longer, or perhaps be designed) the natural impulse to expand and breed and control could be less pronounced or possibly not there at all. A designed species would likely be more plausible as the the effectiveness of evolutionary pressure is what drives advancement, and without it...do you ever get to a sentient species? Tough to say. Point being, a less aggressive sentient species may not be in conflict and may more naturally be willing to compromise and work together. 

Your scenario is problematic and as others have mentioned...everyone dies...errr every snake dies. The problem with your scenario is that your ecosystem is not scientifically plausible. To have an environment you need each progressively more complex creature to make it all work. You can't just have big trees that bear fruit without, bacteria and other cellular organisms, insects, reptiles, birds etcetera. It is hypothetically possible that you could stop at the insect level and still have big trees but it seems unlikely. You need pollinators, though you could argue that this is done via wind...it's not foolproof but if there is no competition among trees I suppose it's possible. You need soil cultivators, insects and smaller life play a major role in making soil more than dirt/rock. They make it able to support plant life. Without them there simply aren't going to be any nutrients in the soil to make things grow which is the main problem. 

Sexual selection. It could be that mates are chosen based on the size and luster of said tails. Defense mechanism. Many animals use hair and patterns to appear larger than they really are, this can make a predator see them as more of a threat than they really are. 

There is an option 2 however... Sometimes the "greatest" good is in the smallest deeds. Simply wander the planet helping people you meet. Copy some food for the hungry living on the street, a dose of expensive medicine for a sick child, 50 bucks for someone to make rent that keeps them from sliding into poverty and losing hope... 

Ironically I think that architecture gets simpler in this case. Planet-side architecture would obviously be different for a species that could fly, but in space the need for such changes doesn't exist as anyone could "fly" so to speak with the lack of gravity. Where on earth wings provide mobility in space they would not...or rather they would be mostly unnecessary. Unless these avian humanoids have significantly improved ship design is is likely that you are still going to be dealing with cramped spaces, which actually make wings more of a liability. So get to the point what changes would be needed... Well very few. Odds are you would need slightly larger compartments and connections, wings to support humanoid flight would be massive and you would have to allow for more space just to move around, even if they never open their wings. Beyond that not many changes would be necessary. I can see adding a larger compartment containing work out equipment. This compartment would need to allow the bird men to stretch their wings out fully. It should probably also contain fairly powerful fans to allow the exercise of their wings to avoid atrophy.
