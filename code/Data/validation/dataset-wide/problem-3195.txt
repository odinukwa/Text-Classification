I've done some research into this, but I can offer only a partial answer at present. The graph in the article you linked shows that the national output from whaling peaked in the 1850s. The population of the United States in that year (based on the 1850 US Census) was 23,191,876. At its peak, the United States whaling fleet consisted of a total of 735 ships (out of 900 in the world). The Whaleman’s Shipping List has listings for 20 ports in 1855, the largest of which was New Bedford, Massachusetts (also where the newspaper was published). The New Bedford whaling fleet peaked at 329 vessels (valued at more than $12 million), and more than 10,000 men were employed on those vessels. By 1860, vessels sailing from Bristol County Massacheussets (New Bedford is the largest town in Bristol County) produced 80% of the output of the United States whaling industry. 10,458 hands were employed on these vessels, out of a total of 12,301 employed on board the entire US whaling fleet. By contrast, the number employed in "refining sperm oil and whale oil" in Bristol County in 1860 was just 117 (out of a total of 337 employed in those industries in the whole United States). [source - Lance E. Davis, Robert E. Gallman, Karin Gleiter: In Pursuit of Leviathan: Technology, Institutions, Productivity, and Profits in American Whaling, 1816-1906, University of Chicago Press, 2007] Clearly the numbers employed in refining the oil were tiny compared to the numbers actually employed on board the whaling fleet. Based on these numbers, a total of 12,638 people were directly employed in producing the whale oil in 1860. This number is presumably slightly down from the peak that occurred a few years earlier, but probably not by much. The total workforce in the United States has been estimated to be only about 11,110,000 people. I have to say that I am not entirely convinced by this number, given that we know the total United States population in 1860 was 31,443,321 (based on the 1860 US Census), however it does give us a starting point to work from. Based on the figure of 11,110,000, we can say that just 0.11% of the workforce was directly employed at the sharp end of whale oil production in 1860. Just for comparison, the estimated workforce in 1850 was 8,250,000. If a similar number were employed in whaling in 1850 (which, based on the graph in your article, this seems a reasonable estimate), then the percentage of the workforce rises to 0.15%. Now, obviously these figures don't include all the "downstream activities" that you mentioned in the question. Clearly there were a large number of jobs that supported the whaling fleet, from boat-builders and sail-makers, to those that sold the victuals and fitted out the vessels before they sailed. In addition, a large number of people would have been required to market and distribute the finished product. Unfortunately, I haven't yet been able to locate any sources to quantify the exact numbers of people employed in those industries (which I why I said this is just a partial answer). 

Well, William did rebel against his father, Henry II. He may well even have hounded him to his death in 1189. One might argue that there were valid reasons for Richard's rebellion, but one can certainly make a case that Richard was a bad son. It was during the campaign of 1189 that William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke ("the greatest Knight in Christendom"), defeated Richard in combat while covering Henry II's flight from Le Mans. After Henry's death, when Richard was king, he would welcome William Marshal back to court. This is instructive, and tells us a lot about Richard. 

The answers are contained in the Wikipedia paged linked in the question. The quote from US Secretary of State George Marshall's speech at Harvard University on June 5, 1947 explains: 

We know that Assur-danin-pal rebelled even before the death of his father, King Shalmaneser III. We know that it was a serious rebellion that spread to at least 27 cities, including Ashur Nineneh, and Arbela. We know that it took four years to put the rebellion down [Kuhrt, 1995, Vol 2 p490]. It seems that the rebellion was eventually put down by Assur-danin-pal's brother, Shamshi-Adad V, probably with assistance from Marduk-zakir-shumi I. According to the Cambridge Ancient History: 

So, to answer your question, no there wasn't a continuation of practice from the Neolithic to the Iron Age. The Iron Age peoples seem to have abandoned the earlier sites that their Neolithic and Bronze Age ancestors had created. In fact, although we can detect some "cultural continuity" from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age, the Iron Age seems to show a clear break with the large-scale "ritual" sites of earlier periods. We do see some continuity in burial practices from the later Bronze Age into the early Iron Age, but that is to be expected. There is no evidence for a great influx of people who might have brought new practices and traditions with them. The people of the early Iron Age were the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the people of the later Bronze Age. Changes to things like burial practices would have been gradual (I suspect that the monuments of the Bronze Age were also abandoned gradually, but that is not preserved in the archaeological record). We don't know what forces drove the people of the Iron Age to build defensive structures like hill-forts and brochs. It is a natural instinct to want to protect what you have. It seems likely that there was a perceived threat and that these new monumental structures were the response, but there doesn't seem to be any evidence that they were built on the sites of earlier structures, "ritual" or otherwise. 

However, we do not have the original letter. This raises the possibility of errors in transcription by later copyists. Indeed, the surviving manuscripts are not all consistent in regard to the date of the eruption. 

As far as I can see, the quote does not seem to appear in any of the surviving manuscripts or transcripts of William of Malmesbury's 'Chronicle of the Kings of England'. If we look at the footnote in question in full, it says: 

But there is no mention of Yugoslavian "boots on the ground". Full text of Into the Storm: American Covert Involvement in the Angolan Civil War, 1974-1975 by Shannon Rae Butler on the Internet Archive. 

[Ibid, p157] As you can see, the opium exports over the period that you are interested in, while nowhere near their peak, were nevertheless substantial. In terms of profits, according to this site the approximately 24,000 chests of opium exported by the company in 1839, 

The master craftsmen who built the original figures signed their work. So far, 87 names have been identified. Each master craftsman would have had assistants working for them. The current best estimate is that about 1000 people in total worked on the project. With 87 teams, each led by a master craftsmen, working on the project, each team would have to produce an average of just over 8 warriors per year for 11 years (in reality, the actual number would have been higher due to wastage). Recent research at UCL suggests that the craftsmen were organised in a sophisticated labour model known today as 'Toyotism', which would have greatly improved the efficiency of the production process. 

EDIT: While doing a little further research on the subject, I just found this paper from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime which covers the use of poppies and opiates in the ancient Eastern Mediterranean. Hope this is useful. 

At the same time, the expansion of citizenship was also substantial in the late Republic. In 129 BC the Roman census recorded some 294,000 (male) citizens. This number jumped to about half-a-million in the census of 84 BC (following the settlement of the Social War). By the time of the census conducted by Augustus in 27 BC, that number had reached 5 million! The senate had debated reforms, but these were too little too late. 

No, England would not have been called "England" in the early post-Roman period. The name "England" derives from the Old English name Englaland, which means "Land of the Angles". The earliest recorded use of the term that I'm aware of is in the late ninth century translation into Old English of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, which had been written in Latin in in the early eighth century. The name certainly seems to have become more widespread from the reign of King Alfred, although that may simply be because we have more surviving written evidence from that date. Obviously, the name had been long established when Sir Thomas Mallory wrote Le Morte d'Arthur in the late 15th century, so he probably didn't even realise it was an anachronism. Germanic settlers/invaders arrived in Britain in the early post-Roman period. We don't know how they identified themselves when they first arrived in Britain, but they eventually came to identify themselves as Saxons, Angles, etc. Bede names the Angles, the Saxons, and the Jutes as the main Germanic tribes that conquered England. The earliest genealogies of the kings of the various kingdoms weren't compiled until the ninth century. 

The main institutions were the Senate and the military. The personal wealth and power of the members of the Senate, and the rivalries that ensued, threatened to tear the state apart. The creation, and expansion, of a permanent military force, spread across the empire and with each part loyal its own general, who was appointed by the Senate, added a military wing to those senatorial factions. 

This answer may be a little superficial, but I'm not quite how much detail you are asking for here. "Sprinklers" were just bottles, usually with long-narrow necks, which we believe to have been used to sprinkle scented water, perfumes or or other liquids. Depending on the burial conditions, it is sometimes - but by no means always - possible to carry out residue analysis to determine what they originally contained. By analogy with the later attested use of similar vessels, they were probably used to sprinkle their contents over a relatively large area. The design of the bottle varied considerably over time and in different places. We have found examples over a geographic range stretching from the UK to India. 

I've been wondering whether to expand on why neither of the versions is entirely accepted. I've decided to add this as a separate answer so as to avoid creating any further confusion in my answer above. This is, perhaps, even more appropriate as what follows is really little more than a footnote, to a footnote to history. The differences between the texts of Cicero and Plutarch, and those of Caesar (and hence Adrian Goldsworthy) might appear to be minor to us today, but at the time the implications of those differences were not at all insignificant. Indeed, that subtle difference was a key element in a campaign to undermine the reputations of both Mark Antony and Caesar himself. 

Which would seem to be a reference to chronique métrique de Guillaume Guiart. Writing about the year 1214 he says: 

You can read the full English translation of the Great Hymn of the Aten here, (I'm sure a quick Google search will find many other sites). [In case anyone is interested, you can also see the Hieroglyphic text of the Great Hymn to the Aten, discovered in the tomb of Ay.] The text of Psalm 104 is also available in English on many sites, for example the King James translation can be found here. 

Any pay advanced to the soldiers in France would be deducted from their pay later. Soldiers also often arranged for a proportion of their pay to be sent home to relatives, which would limit the amount available to be advanced to them while serving in France. 

The Hindenburg was originally built with 25 double-berthed cabins which accommodated up to 50 passengers. While the ship was laid up in Frankfurt during the winter of 1936-1937, 9 more cabins were added, accommodating an additional 20 passengers. The capacity was then 70 fare-paying passengers. The arrangement of cabins on the Hindenburg in 1936 is shown here: 

From the above sources, we can attempt an answer to your question. (Please note that this answers the question as originally asked, rather than the later edits) Estimates for the GDP of the British Empire vary widely. If you are interested in a discussion of the various methodologies that have been tried, there is an excellent discussion in What Was the UK GDP Then? A Data Study. Two examples quoted there are Deane and Cole (1967), who gave the following estimates: 

This is the earliest reference that we know of to "Laws and customs granted to them by the ancient kings of England". A similar reference appears in the text of the coronation oath of Edward IV from 1461, which has also survived. 

The Neolithic period in Britain coincides with the introduction of farming and pottery, and dates from about 4000 BC to about 2,500 BC. The main monuments associated with the Neolithic period in Britain are: 

The paper British Concentration Camps of the Second South African War by John L. Scott examines the question of the concentration camp in South Africa in some detail. It is rather long, but is well worth reading. The British National Archives hold an extensive collection of records relating to the Second Boer war, including records of the camps. Although relatively few are available online, all are available to view in person at Kew. 

Most of what is now Colombia was part of the Muisca Confederation before the Spanish Conquest. What we know about the Muisca was recorded by Spanish chroniclers many of whom were writing perhaps a century or more after the Muisca had been conquered. As a result, there is some debate about how accurate our understanding is. At present there doesn't seem to be any clear consensus. Interestingly, the Muisca Confederation is also said to be the source for the El Dorado legend. 

tl;dr Based on reports in declassified FBI files and contemporary reports in the US media, it seems likely that the members of "Murder, Inc." referred to themselves as "the Combination", although we will probably never be able to be entirely certain about this. 

While translations like the ones in Breasted (pp 175-192) and Lichtheim (pp 29-35) are excellent resources for the study of the Battle of Megiddo (not to mention the study of ancient Egypt in general), they can sometimes create the impression that we know far more detail than is actually the case. Of course, many modern websites are even worse in this regard! Details in the original texts are often difficult to interpret. There can be a number of reasons for this. Firstly, descriptions of the battle and subsequent siege are much less complete than we would like. They frequently give us just the highlights where we would prefer to know more detail. For example, we are told that, during the siege, the Egyptians constructed a timber wall and ditch surrounding Megiddo. The trees used to build the wall are described as "bnr" ("sweet") which, in this context, could mean that they were fruit trees. If so, the Thutmose's troops probably destroyed the orchards that surrounded Megiddo to construct the wall, adding further to the city's woes. However, we cannot know for certain because the texts are just not explicit. We also know that the siege lasted seven months. It seems reasonable that the Egyptians would also have built other structures as part of their siege-works (perhaps defensive "camps" or barracks for their own troops, for example), but if they did, the texts tell us nothing about them. This point is particularly relevant to your question. The texts themselves are usually damaged. Lacunae (holes) in manuscript texts mean that words, or even entire sentences, are often missing. Inscriptions on temple walls are frequently damaged. Where this damage is relatively recent (as with the inscriptions at Karnak), we can sometimes make use of copies made by early Egyptologists. In this instance, we are fortunate to have a copy published in 1906 by the German scholar Kurt Heinrich Sethe in his Urkunden der 18 Dynastie, which is generally considered to be an accurate record of the inscription at Karnak as it survived at that time.
