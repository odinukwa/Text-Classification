According to this page, 298 Senators have died in office (it does not include the last member to die, who died in 2010. I included him in the previously stated number). According to this page, 815 House Representatives have died in office (it does not include the last three members to die in office. I included them in the previously stated number). Our grand total is 1113 US congressmen to die in office since the 1st US Congress in 1789, as of April 25, 2012. 

However, there are various reasons how so many came to be depicting lions in general (besides what you stated). For example, the lion in the Netherlands coat of arms is from the Dutch Republic Lion. The Dutch Republic Lion came from the Duchy of Brabant coat of arms. The Lion on the Duchy of Brabant coat of arms is now also present on the coat of arms of Belgium. This is one example of two or more coats of arms (or parts of coats of arms) coming from one source. To sum it up, many of the lions you showed just aren't the same. Lions in different attitudes are seen as distinctly different lions. However, in some cases, they came from a common source. Because the lion was seen as the king of the beasts since the Stone Age, at least, it was a common charge (or supporter). Thus, the fact that two coat of arms have lions on them does not necessarily mean both came from the same source (although it could). 

They don't all seem to be the same lion. Spain and Denmark's lions aren't even yellow. This is another rendering of the Coat of Arms of Sweden: 

I'm going to analyze the text itself rather than the events here (this is History SE, not Christianity SE). (Fredsbend has written a good answer about other aspects) 

With these evidences, my conclusion is that the Gospels have been kept true to the originals throughout these two millenia and that the original Gospels did accurately record Jesus' life, how He lived, and what He claimed. P.s. There are many more proofs for the accuracy of the Gospels that I don't have time to go into today, but if anyone would like clarification on a particular point (or perhaps a point I haven't mentioned), feel free to leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

Found information and more or less contemporary sources on Google Books (here, here and here, for example) and in gallica.fr (here), but no source cares to say how he died, only hinting that it was sudden and unexpected; the only person I found who said something about how he died was Voltaire, who, in his letters, didn't hide his rejoicing at Royer's death (they had a quarrel before): 

From what I gathered, without knowing which book it was you were reading, both towns appear to have been two mining centers, established by the mining company El Boleo, and they must have just taken their names from existing landmarks (mountains or streams – there's a Purgatorio stream near Santa Rosalía, in the center of that mining area). In any case, looks like it was nothing strange for the Spaniards to name places like that, for, from what I have seen, there's at least one Purgatorio stream in Sonora, another one in Jalisco and, much farther away, one in Colombia. The Purgatoire river, being in Colorado, it's my guess that it was so named by the Spaniards and got its name anglicised (Protestants don't believe in Purgatory and it would be odd for them to name anything after it). Providence, Rhode Island, was named, as also was every Spanish town of that name, after the Divine Providence by its founders, deeply religious people, so in that case it was just coincidence. 

The quotation "fino al '600 riprodurre monete altrui fu considerato legale" actually means that it was legal to counterfeit other people's [i. e. foreign] money, in fact, aristocrats, churchmen, traders, and guild engaged in such counterfeiting, and it was usual for official mints to counterfeit their own currency (thus producing debased coins) — but a private individual could be severely punished if caught by the affected authorities and could end being boiled alive. There's an interesting chapter on currency counterfeiting in England in Malcom Gaskill's Crime and Mentalities in Early Modern England. 

As far as I know, most if not all rulers in Christian Europe "conceded that the Emperor was the universal lord of Christendom, but only in high office, not in deed" (taken from The Prince and the Law, 1200-1600, which speaks specifically about the King of France). Thus, most were just concerned with obtaining and securing liberties for themselves and their lands (in the case of Germany and Italy), or avoiding interference from the Emperor (as in the kingdoms outside Imperial lands – France, England, etc). Although the Emperor real power was limited, breaking from the Empire and denying the Emperor's lordship over the Christian community would have been quite daring; for example, the Italian cities became independent de facto but never, to my knowledge, declared any intention of breaking with the Empire. I think that didn't happen even after the Reformation: reformed rulers claimed that the Emperor had no right to force Catholicism into the lands they ruled, but didn't deny the Emperor's overlordship, however theoretical it was. Anyway, my knowledge is limited and I might be wrong, so let's see what other posters have to say. 

It was part of Vichy France. You didn't mention St Pierre and Miquelon. These small islands close to Newfoundland were also under Vichy control, until taken with (very little) force by the Free French. They still are French possessions today. I don't know when Saint Martin came under Free French control, it must have been before 1943, because in that year crown princess Juliana visited the island. I doubt very much if the heir to the throne would do that, if the other half was under Vichy France control. Saint Martin is also Sint Maarten. The island is shared by France and The Netherlands. It's the only place where those two countries share a common border. I'm only talking about Saint Martin/Sint Maarten. I assume - but don't know for sure - both islands were under Vichy French control. 

I can't give any sources, but think this was only possible after introduction of the scutum (rectangular) shield. Hoplon (round) shields do not make for good testudos. I have never read anything about testudos when the Roman army employed phalanx tactics. Anyway, a phalanx can very well be seen as a form of a testudo. 

Be aware that the German army from the armistice onwards planned to regain its old size, stature and position. The German army trained (secretly) officers and tactics in the USSR between the wars. The German navy developed (illegally) submarines in Holland and Sweden. Long before this lance corporal H. comes into play. All he actually did was turn the switch from 'covert' to 'full production'. When that happened, it paid off. Germany reintroduced the draft again in 1935. All existing ranks were bumped up one level. Corporals became sergeants, lieutenants captains, colonels brigadiers, etc. It's very difficult to grow a force of 100.000 man into a force of 3 million, but the Germans did it almost overnight. Not without problems, though. Enough and capable non commissioned officers was always a big problem during WW2. Over all, the flexibility of the German army was far superior to that of the allies. The Allies won because they out produced Germany in every field. They had far more tanks. More, not better. With the exception of the T 34. Much higher mechanization (most German divisions had horse drawn supply carts), and from mid 1944 total air supremacy. Even so, it took them almost 3 months to fight from the beaches of Normandy to Paris. At a huge cost of life (on both sides). Despite being commanded by a lance corporal making not very sensible decisions, the flexibility of the German army was what it kept going. 

I'd say Half-Uncial (3rd Century AD) and Carolingian (9th Century AD) scripts; as it says in the Wikipedia text for the latter, 

Marcellus is still not identified, and his work is lost. According to a footnote in a 2006 Cambridge edition of Proclus' Commentary on Plato's Timaeus, 

Although there were many languages spoken throughout the Byzantine Empire (or Eastern Roman Empire), its court and administration language switched from Latin to Greek over time. 

EDIT- I'm adding extra information: The "Grand Turk" was the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud I, who died in December 1754 – his death was sudden, too, and the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica says he died from heart disease, so it's easy to infer he had a stroke; the ambassador was Roland Puchot, the mentioned (Count) des Alleurs,not Ailleurs as I wrote before (corrected that), who died in Constantinople in late 1754 or early 1755, of a stroke ("un attaque d'apoplexie" according to this source). So, if the sources and Voltaire are to be believed, Pancrace Royer has most probably died of a stroke. 

Quartó (plural quartons) was the Catalan name of each of the four quarters the island was divided into after the conquest of Ibiza and Formentera by the Aragonese in 1235 (Catalan Wikipedia article about the quartons here). Interestingly enough, a couple of PDF documents (1 and 2) at the Institute of Ibicene Studies (Institut d'Estudis Eivissencs in Catalan) mention that according to official documents from the time of the flag's creation in 1979, its basis had been an alleged flag of the ancient University of Ibiza (no mention was made of why it had four castles). According to the said institute, there's no trace of any flag of the ancient University of Ibiza either, so in 2007 there was a proposal for changing the flag for another, more coherent one from a heraldic point of view, but was ultimately cancelled. 

Some more info to complement what @PieterGeerkens has found: there's a very scholarly work on the subject on Google Books, Het Bier-oproer te Leeuwarden, in het jaar 1487, in zijne oorzaken en gevolgen by Jacob Dirks; sadly (for me), it's in Dutch and several passages are in Old Dutch or Frisian. But more or less, from what I managed to understand from Google Translate and some common sense, there was a political dispute at the time between the Vetkoopers and the Schieringers (a term that doesn't refer to the community near Leeuwarden but, apparently, to the Cistercian monks' habit, as explained here), which apparently had much to do with both the prohibition and the riots. 

In 1976 Tim Severin proved with the Brendan Voyage it was possible for Irish monks not only to go to Iceland, but all the way to the Americas. He did have a couple of advantages the ancients didn't have: 

No, one of the most difficult decisions Churchill had to make during the war was to stop economic preferential treatment of the colonies to get American Land Lease support. That preferential treatment was the cork on which the British empire floated. Without it, the empire could not be maintained. That's what happened - not very professionally - after the war. The Indian division was a real mess. Could Britain have kept her empire? I doubt that very much. It would have taken longer, but eventually colonial empires were no longer acceptable. Some colonial empires lasted a bit longer, but those (the Portuguese, for example) weren't very enlightened rulers. The Dutch and the French tried to keep their empires with force of arms, without success. Being a Dutchman, I can go into a bit more detail: After the liberation of Indonesia (they already had declared their independence) the British somewhat helped to regain the colony for us. As soon as possible, most of the Dutch army was send over to support the KNIL (Dutch East Indian army). Militarily the Indonesians were defeated. But US economic pressure (if you keep Indonesia, you don't get Marshall Aid) forced the government into recognition. Now, even if the Dutch government would have chosen to keep the Dutch East Indies, eventually they would have to leave. The more you educate local people, the more you effectively train your opposition. Either you rule by iron rod (not a good idea) or realize that colonialism isn't profitable anymore. The same goes for England/India as well. It was a matter of economics. For England, colonies worked economically as long as colonial products got preferential treatment. Without it, the empire was loosing money. For us Dutch almost the same, but more direct. The proceeds from the Dutch East Indies were less than Marshall Aid. In both cases the colonial power had to eat humble pie and close it down.
