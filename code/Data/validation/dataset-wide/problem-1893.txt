This is a tough one, because if you go to any job hunting advice site, they'll have a dozen different rehearsed ways to "be natural." When I was a recruiter, I had a candidate who read that he should make sure to smile, so at the end of each question, there would be a pause, and then a huge, forced, fake smile that really creeped-out the interviewer. Probably, you can make a point to try and briefly make eye contact with the different people (briefly, for each individual, changing the target of your focus as you talk so you're not staring down just one). Look at the people you are talking to, but don't stare, in other words. Then you are talking to them, not talking down at the table or avoiding them. It's a mild form of interaction that wouldn't necessarily force you to run contrary to your normal personality, but would engage you directly with the interviewer(s). This will also force you to observe their reactions, which can be helpful. 

Then it sounds like the recruiter put you forward at a rate you never agreed to. That's the recruiter's problem, not yours, as long as you (as answered elsewhere) are willing to walk away from it. If, on the other hand, you told the recruiter that 550 was perfectly acceptable rate for you, and you're changing your tune because you think the company might be willing to pay more, then you can hold out, of course, but you're not treating your recruiter fairly, and they might pull you as a candidate and stop working with you. If they introduced you to the company, and later withdraw you, then the company likely will not want to work with you on the side (they'd still owe the recruiter a fee, and if a recruiter pulls a candidate, they'll likely trust the recruiter's judgment and view that as a "red flag"). 

It seems like your job at the museum you are being paid to be available and to respond when needed during certain hours. If it was an IT job, it would be the equivalent of being "on call." Your software development gig is being paid by hours worked and work product developed. As long as there are no formal prohibitions, I think you are okay, if in somewhat unorthodox territory here, provided - If you are deep into some complicated or intensive coding, and any kind of alarm or other event happens that you are expected to respond to, you go above and beyond and respond immediately, even if you feel it's not needed to be exactly right away. You don't even want to see where the line between ethical and not is, since you are essentially getting paid by two employers for the same work time. Again, you are being paid to be available to respond, and to respond as needed, so that is your #1 priority, over all other considerations. If you wait a few minutes to wrap up the coding, then you are, indeed, not fulfilling your obligation to be available to respond. If you are doing software development work at the museum from 8 PM to 2 AM, and alarms go off and you need to attend to it, and deal with police, etc, for an hour, you better not bill for that hour on the software side. They should only get billed for five hours, or less if you took some breaks. Even though, potentially, they would have paid you for all that time developing, you didn't actually spend it all doing the work, so make sure you don't bill them if one job's responsibilities don't allow you to actively engage in the others'. The only other consideration is if you're making use of a lot of museum resources while computing - if you're using a work machine to connect to the Internet and working like that, which it appears you are not doing, that would not be ethical. Likewise, if your work means you are using Internet connection and data throughput via the museum's physical network, that is also potentially problematic. Hopefully your development is all done locally, network-wise, on your laptop. If not, since you are getting pretty much getting double-paid, it's not too much to ask to invest in a data hotspot out of your own pocket. If you have all of that covered, ethically, there shouldn't be an issue about talking about it in an interview. First of all, if I see a resume where someone has "independent contractor software developer," along with something like "night shift security at the museum," I'm not going to assume that both were during overlapping hours. In fact, I'd assume one was a "second" job. Just like if I saw "CFO for GE" and "Bartender at the West Side Businessmen's Club," I'd assume they didn't occur at the same time. If that's the assumption, it probably won't come up, and they're going to assume the museum gig supplements the developer job. Also, if sitting in a chair and waiting for an alarm to go off that never goes off has no relevance to your next developer position, I probably wouldn't include it on my resume, even if it was a night shift vs day shift situation, because it does not add any value to my resume. Just like a CFO from GE probably wouldn't bother listing his bartending gig if he was after a CEO job for his next opportunity. Now, because you're asking, and it's on your mind, it may seem to you like you're hiding something, but, really, if you asked "should I include my night job at the museum on my software developer CV/resume" and the hours did not overlap, I think the advice would be "no." So leave it off, and it should never come up. Now, if, as an independent contractor, they need some kind of supervisory reference, then I'd bring up that I worked as a warm-body to watch for alarms going off after-hours at the museum as a second job, but then, in that case, again, the hours overlapping should never come up. Again, I don't think this is deceitful, and volunteering it when it isn't even on the radar not only puts it there, but raises questions, in their mind. "I didn't care, so why is he so eager to put my mind at ease? What's REALLY going on here?" In a job I had, there was an ongoing system overhaul of the core IT system. I heard about it, in was called "Next Gen" as a project. In my first all staff meeting, the director in charge stands up for their project update and says, emphatically "First of all, EVERYTHING IS FINE!" What did I think when I heard this? It was "Holy crap. How bad is it?" (It was that bad, BTW.) Don't lie, but don't create issues where they don't exist. 

Generally, those kinds of questions are focused on establishing the lowest offer they can make to you that they can. There's no reason for them to know what you are or have made in the past. If someone with your qualifications for this kind of work is worth somewhere between X and Y, then what you made before is irrelevant. If they want to ask what your expect for compensation, you can certainly share your expectations, but, of course, that would all depend on how the complete package, with benefits, looks. If they don't share the salary target range with you, and you're not working with a recruiter who can screen that out, then you should ask them what their target is. That is actually relevant to your discussions. What you make or made is not. Sorry recruiters, you're not getting my salary history! 

It's great if you are that awesome that you can get a job at the snap of your fingers. The advice is more for people who want to err on the side of financial caution. The advice is mostly to protect people financially, since job hunts drag on, companies hiring can be unreliable or have plans change. It prevents someone from being in a position where, having already left their previous job, if the rest of the world does not view a candidate in the awesome, shining light that they see themselves, they wind up accepting a job that is not at all what they wanted, because they need to re-start the income stream ASAP. Or they don't even have that choice and get into financial trouble that can take months or years to unwind. In a best of both worlds scenario, if you want to take a break, you can always have your written, signed, accepted job offer with a starting date pushed back another week or two beyond the length of your notice period. Ultimately, if you are that top-notch and in demand, then the advice isn't really meant for you, it's more for the rest of us who don't have life always aligning as we'd like. 

Companies do this, but the fact is that your compensation is supposed to be based on the work you do now, not the work you used to do. They agreed that $60K - $65K was in the compensation range for this particular position. If you accept the offer, they will be underpaying you to the tune of $10K+ per year, or 15%+ under the appropriate wage. Not sure why what you are currently making comes into the picture, because that's irrelevant to the new position. Basically they are saying they are going to punish you for having an employment history for them, because if you were an outsider coming in and they could not peek into your compensation, you'd be getting paid the range you originally discussed. Who says "Thank your for being a valued and loyal employee. Now bend over...." - rhetorical question. Your new employer is who, obviously. There's nothing illegal about trying to grossly underpay a worker for a job and low-balling them. There's no expectation of privacy about your current wage from your employer (who pays that wage), so there's nothing illegal about having the information and choosing to use it. There's nothing illegal about you declining and starting to look elsewhere, either. There's nothing illegal about you accepting the offer, but I can't say it's particularly smart to tell your new employer that you're willing to be a doormat for them. The idea that you'd cave in and accept a grossly inadequate offer, and that this will somehow position you for a raise to a fair and equitable wage in the future is kind of an unrealistic interpretation. The company already has shown a willingness to underpay for arbitrary reasons, and to try and strong-arm you into it (ignore the counter-offer, while offering no legitimate reasons). Why would you think that would change, at all, and why would you think it would change after you rewarded their behavior and showed them it will work on you? Stay put and find a new job where you are, unless you think the job market is better in the new location, but if you decide to look for a new position in the new location, make sure there aren't strings attached or claw-back provisions for the relocation money. It might be better to accept, because declining and staying at your current wage might be an indication to them that you might be looking to leave, and they might drop the hammer on you if they can line up a replacement, so if you decline and decide to look for something else where you are (if you like where you are living), maybe give a reason (only if asked) that the differential isn't enough to entice you to leave the community you like so much. Also - relocation money. Some companies directly pay for the relocation. In this case, it looks like they are giving you a bonus for that relocation. If your relocation costs are anywhere near $7500 you get screwed in the deal, because you pay FICA, federal and state taxes out of that bonus. Also, under the new GOP tax plan, you can no longer deduct moving expenses if you itemize on your federal taxes (as of January 1, 2018), so there's no re-couping that. Make sure you don't view that relocation bonus as $7500 to pay for relocation. It will probably be closer to $4000 in real moving money. A standard agreement I used to see was where they'd give a bonus for the typical estimated cost of the move, plus a "gross-up" so the after-tax net winds up covering the move. If you wind up losing money on the move, that's another consideration when evaluating the offer. 

Even if the intent is a benevolent "see the light" initiative, it's pretty much impossible, especially if one is already resisting change, to not take it as "see, dummy?" and as a rubbing of one's nose in being wrong, wrong wrong. The situation you are in is very bad, but this approach will probably turn up the setting to "toxic." Instead of just looking at the manager's point of view as resistance, assess what the objections are, and try to take a more pro-active approach. Go to the manager, in a formal requested meeting, probably as a group or as an agreed-upon representative of the group. State your objective case for using more modern tools and frameworks. Then state your understanding of the manager's objections, and ask if you've missed anything. Then you ask the manager if there's any way you could target a smaller, lower-profile task or project to use as a "proof of concept" - to allow the manager to see the value of such an approach, but with minimal risk. It's entirely possible, if the manager fears being obsolete or unqualified to work with a team using these techniques that the answer will still be "no." However, if that's the case, the more confrontational, high-profile, in-your-face approach would probably also have gotten a "no," but pretty much drawn battle lines in the process. At least, with this kind of approach, it's less personal, it's offered from an objective, professional, good-for-the-company work improvement perspective. 

First of all, realize that what you are witnessing, in the aftermath of reaching out to someone who seems to be an unhappy loner, is someone who is showing the characteristics or possibly reasons why they seem to be an unhappy loner (though knowing all of the worker's kidney stones by name might have been a decent clue, as well). Except now it is focused on you at the workplace. Two things - the first is to make a light apology - "Hey, I noticed you seem unhappy with me since we tried that gaming experience. I'm sorry if I was abrupt or rude with you. That wasn't my intention." And offer an handshake. The second is, while this might thaw the "no interaction at all" freeze zone, don't expect your co-worker to be friendly or chatty, even if this is put behind you. Your co-worker is either not very comfortable interacting, which is fine, or is an unpleasant person. Either way, keep your interactions professional, and only about professional/work things, going forward. Not out of retaliation or anything like that, just because that's the level of interaction that makes the most sense for this person. 

The application form is a boilerplate document that generally assumes you are leaving some other company to go there, and allows them to do a little digging on what, if any issues, there might have been. They gather preliminary information on someone who is, previously, unknown to them. That's not the case here, since you're not actually "leaving" anything for the new position. You're staying with the company, and they don't have to dig about anything because your experiences with the company you are staying with are well-known to them. Their standard process is to have an application filled out, so they make you do it to, but how they use it (if at all), will be very different. So, in this case, it's a formality. Leave it simple - "internal position change for more desired position." Bam. Done, and you don't burn any bridges or ruffle any feathers. OR - since it says "if applicable" - you could also fill in "N/A (not applicable) - internal transfer." Anything bland, generic and not especially informative will do. They won't care. They will care if you say "my current position stinks, I never should have left the previous one." In the interview they might ask why you want to go back to a position or area you had before. Just state that you really, really enjoyed your time at that position and miss the work, as much as you value the experiences gained in your current one.
