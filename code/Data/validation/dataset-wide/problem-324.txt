Therefore, this may not be very reliable for the Milky Way. That being said, it is worthwhile to note that within 1 parsec of the galactic center there are 10 million stars, and that this region would be very bright since it does sit within the galactic core. My Conclusion: it can go either way. (I'll confer with an astrophysics buddy of mine for clarification and update this answer.) But we're not done. We've only considered the Milky Way Galaxy. What of the brightest objects in the universe? Quasars Quasars, or quasi-stellar objects, are active galactic nuclei of obscenely high luminosity. The brightest Quasar, 3C 273 has an apparent visual magnitude of +12.9 and an absolute magnitude of −26.7 making it 4 trillion times more bright than the sun. Using the same calculation above, we find that it'll have the same brightness as the sun at 9.8 parsecs or 32 LY. The same arguments as before applies, but less strictly so. Side note: if a civilization were to develop on a rogue planet orbiting a quasar, they'd see some fantastic jets. I'd also expect them to use the jets as a time-keeping mechanism (much as we can use the moon to keep time in Lunar Calendars). Other Considerations Since your planet is rogue, you'll need to consider the following as well: 

The station's orbit will destabilize. There are several underlying principles to keeping a ring-station in a stable orbit around its parent: 

Many photos of extra-galactic galaxies use filters, false-coloring or are enhanced to emphasize certain features of the galaxy or combat disruptive effects such as light pollution. Examples: M42, Crab Nebula, Horsehead Nebula, and M31: Andromeda [4] [5]. If you look at software used in [5] , you'll see that the astrophotographer used stacking, masking, and photoshop to develop the final photo from a set of 44-291 photos (44 + 86 +71 + 90). Nevertheless raw photos are remarkable. Sol & The Milky Way From Earth, if you travel far enough from light polluted regions, you can see the milky way galaxy center with the naked eye. (Paranal Observatory) (wallpaper) (space.com gallery). Sol is 27,000 LY from the galactic center in the Orion–Cygnus Arm. The bulgy core of the Milky Way extends to about 10,000 LY and the 1 parsec galactic center contains 10 million stars. That being said, while it is relatively dim compared to nearby light sources with an absolute visual magnitude of −20.9* it is still a very bright object. By comparison the Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.83 which is 20 billion times dimmer. Note: Absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude of the object at 10 parsecs. We Need To Go Deeper Morty! We've established that the Milky Way Galaxy is MUCH brighter than the Sun in terms of its absolute magnitude. It then follows that there must be some distance at which the Milky Way looks as bright as the sun (apparent magnitude). We're interested in whether there's a distance ($d$) at which the apparent magnitude is equivalent to the apparent magnitude of The Sun from Earth. This is a fairly simple calculation given the conversion formula between absolute magnitude ($M$) and apparent magnitude ($m$): $$M = m - 5 (log_{10} d + 1 )$$ $$m = M + 5 (log_{10} d + 1 )$$ Calculating the apparent magnitude of The Sun from earth using $M=+4.83$ and $d = 1/206265$ (1 AU in Parsecs) returns us an apparent magnitude of -26.74. Restructure the formula in terms of the distance (in parsecs): $$d = 10^{\frac{m-M}{5}+1}$$ Then plug and chug with $M = -20.9$ and $m = -26.74$ to get 0.67 parsecs (2.2 LY). **This suggests that at 2 lightyears the rogue planet will see the milky way as brightly as we can see the Sun on Earth; however, it ignores a key premise: The absolute magnitude of a galaxy is calculated differently compared to stars since galaxies are larger than 10 par secs.** 

When the Cost-Benefit of supersonic submarines exceeds that of starships, it'll benefit the planet to use supersonic submarines. Specifically, when the cost of using starships to transfer goods between colonies, stations, and other points of interest on a given planet exceeds that of using supersonic submarines, the latter becomes the cost-effective solution. Where would we see this? 1. Ocean Planets. Despoina in Mass Effect (where the leviathans live), Atlantis, etc... Cost-benefits will favor submersibles when the civilization is not only spread across the ocean's surface, but also makes use of submerged colonies or stations, and/or mine resources at the bottom or beneath the ocean floor. 2. Subocean Planets Enceladus, Naboo This is fairly self-explanatory. This includes planets with a thick surface crust that hides a subterranean ocean or planets with large quantities of subterranean seas and oceans like that seen in Star Wars Episode I's Naboo. In such cases, spaceflight and atmospheric travel is either unfeasible or may be more costly than a direct trip through the subterranean oceans. 3. Oceanic Planets with frequent storm activity. Kamino in Star Wars Episode 2. Oceanic planets with frequent storm activity will pose a problem to starships and atmospheric flight in general. While small storms may not be an issue, particularly larger storms such as Hurricanes, Monsoons, Tropical Storms, or super-storms as we've seen in films like The Day After Tomorrow, or in Stargate Atlantis' The Storm will present logistical or physical obstacles. For civilizations such as Star Trek and Star Wars where spaceflight is cheap and powerful employing high technologies such as deflector shielding and/or antigravity, this can be limited to eliminated. For galaxy-spanning civilizations without such robust technology (such as Mass Effect) this will not be the case. In that case, development and use of supersonic submarines would be of some or great interest to inhabitants. This would be proportional to the severity of the storms experienced, be it tidal waves that disrupt landing platforms, electrical activity in the upper atmosphere (lighting releases X-rays for example), wind speeds that make air-travel difficult, or air-pressures that make flight impossible (Day After Tomorrow). 4. Planets that otherwise disrupt starship activity. Miller's Planet in Interstellar. The gravitational tidal waves from the nearby blackhole are extremely powerful and are liable to destroy starships entering or leaving orbit that do not take care. Additionally, the time dilation effects of going in and out of the atmopshere would pose issues to inhabitants on the surface. Oceanic planets with an atmosphere similar to Venus, or a magnetosphere similar to Jupiter would also disrupt space travel extraordinarily. Typically, it may become cost effective to limit trans-atmospheric flight in favor of ground and water transportation. If the planet is also of an oceanic type, then water and submersible becomes far more effective. No When the Cost-Benefit of starships exceeds that of supersonic submarines Specifically, when the cost of using supersonic submarines to transfer goods between colonies, stations, and other points of interest on a given planet exceeds that of using starships, the latter becomes the cost-effective solution. Where would we see this? Typically on worlds where starship travel is not disrupted. More importantly, this becomes much more present in galactic economies where starship travel is cheap. As we saw on Kamino (Star Wars Episode II), that is the case; but, as we see in Stargate Atlantis or Mass Effect, that is not always the case for civilizations that encompass a galaxy. A galaxy wide civilization with starships. Supercavitation makes them faster than planes, but would a starship just be easier? 

Increase the surface area of the Tetrapi brain. Why (Size matters not; surface area does) The relationship between brain mass and intelligence has been a hot topic in neuroscience and biology for a long time. It derives from a correlation between brain size and body size; however, multiple studies have shown that while body size strongly affects brain size, the brains size does not strongly correlate to higher intelligence. Instead, the primary correlation appears to be brain's surface area. Further neuroscience then showed that the grey matter at the surface of the brain is responsible for thinking. Therefore, higher surface areas increases the brain's processing power. 

There are plenty of existing literary examples of this. In fact there's a trope for it! $URL$ In my experience this is produced by one of two reasons: Disease A disease that targets adults. (e.g. Only Fatal to Adults) Biologically speaking, it could be something that triggers with the onset of puberty. If it's a virus, it could easily have infected the entire population. Population Control Similarly, it could also be a form of population control as in According to TvTropes though, there are more variations: "A society where the old nominally still hold power, but groups of youths have become too powerful to be truly controlled. (e.g. A Clockwork Orange)." 

Pressure Belts As far as pressure belts are concerned, you'll see the same types of equatorial bands as we see on Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn. Pressure belts form due to the spherical shape of the planet unevenly heating the atmosphere at different latitudes. This phenomenon is independent of the underlying geography (provided the geography isn't piercing the atmosphere). Hadley Cells Going one step down, Hadley cells form from the directions of the pressure belts. Like the pressure belts, they form based on the planetary geometry (spherical, tilt) and will be quite similar to Earths. Since Hadley cells extend across the height of the atmosphere, the underlying geography won't affect their behavior. Pressure Cells Take another step down, and you'll reach the pressure cells. These are much more complicated and difficult to predict because they cover a host of phenomena and are dependent on intrinsically sensitive meteorological factors. Formation Pressure cells form from cold and hot air masses in the upper atmosphere (and typically from polar regions for high pressure cells). High pressure masses pushes air out creating a large clearing of clouds over a massive area. The Coriolis effect then shifts this into a cyclone mass. That in turn can transform into any number of other cyclones depending on the cyclogenesis. Cyclogenesis Cyclogenesisis predominately dependent on the scale of the meteorological phenomena. The smaller it is, the more likely it's dependent on geographical phenomena. As far as your pressure cells are concerned, the underlying geography will determine their geometry strongly if the cell is small enough (i.e. Mesoscale). If the cell is large enough (tropical), then underlying geography will affect much less so. The exact nature though, will depend on the geography, the meteorological state of the air mass and its neighbors, and various other meteorological factors that are extremely sensitive to the meteorological conditions. Take Tornados for instance. They are formed by Mesocyclones (cyclonic low pressure cells) formed within strong thunderstorms. When a low wind collides with a higher altitude wind travelling perpendicular to the low wind, the low wind 'shears' the higher wind and causes the air to spin. Then, when the spinning air mass further into the low pressure cell it's pulled upwards, creating an updraft near the ground. This forms the funnel cloud. Then, if rainfall increases in the storm, a strong downdraft drags the mesocyclone with it. When the mesocyclone reaches below the cloud base, it pulls in cool air from the updraft region previously mentioned. The subsequent combination of cool and warm air forms the rotating wall. When the updraft increases in strength, a low pressure area is created near the ground which pulls the mesocyclone further down. This manifests as the funnel of condensation commonly known as the Torndao. Notice how many factors played into it? This is why tornadoes largely occur in large flat areas. These areas provide the space necessary for powerful wind shearing to occur. Furthermore, the area also needs low pressure cells to form commonly. As such, this doesn't occur in deserts (another flat area) because such low pressure systems don't typically form in deserts. Other Geographical Effects Similarly, Mountainous areas will block small cells and funnel the air mass and winds alongside the range (or around the mountains). Coastal areas can (and will) feed high pressure cells. Deserts produce hot air in the day, and cold air at night; next to a coast they will cause a daily shift in air masses back and forth, etc. Largely the formation of cells is dependent first on atmospheric conditions, then geographical conditions. Errata: I didn't cover tornadoes, storms, and other phenomenon because their formation is much more dependent on how a given storm moves and a host of other factors. Conclusion: Ultimately, meteorological processes are chaotic processes, therefore they are absurdly sensitive to every condition and parameter that effects them. As a result, even with the knowledge of how the systems form, we cannot fully predict them. Case in point: predicting tornadoes, tropical storms, earthquakes, et cetera. You don't need to fully predict every aspect of your world. By all means use artistic license where necessary. What you do know is how the geography can effect the local weather generally. Your Pressure Belts and Hadley cells should look similar to (if not identical) to Earth's. Your Pressure Cells on the other hand are impossible to forecast here. They will form and breakdown with storms and high/low pressure systems. The only statistically predictable phenomenon you have is the change in the local heat capacity of the equatorial strip with respect to the orbital tilt; but, that will only affect local weather phenomena, not the atmosphere miles above it. At the very least you'll have a North/South oscillatory shift in the pressure cells as the North/South coastlines are heated unevenly (tilt). Otherwise, the land area is likely too small to suggest other statistically reliable weather phenomena. 

How would they cope with extreme loss without adult support? They'd go through all of the stages of grief and undergo classic crowd psychology responses to disasters (10% panic, 80% freeze, 10% act). This being said, kids have a remarkable ability to adapt because they are young. For inspiration I'd recommend looking into the psychological and sociological development of children and minors who grow up without parental figures. Similarly, emancipated minors. Where would they reside? This will vary dramatically. I expect close knit friends would crash at each other's place (forming familial groups). Any 17-18yo in Student Government would likely try to setup a common shelter for everyone at the school. Delinquents would sleep wherever they want, likely places they weren't allowed to before (as a minor) as an act of rebellion. How would they come together to form a new society? Given their age, I expect a simplistic government would form out of school hierarchies. Minors who participated in Student Government or Model UN have the diplomatic and bureaucratic know-how to form and maintain simple government. Anyone from honors and preparatory schools would have a leg up in become subject matter (if not de-facto) experts in respective fields. With the loss of adults, talent would be recognized and exploited (or supported) rapidly. Similarly, their will never be a shortage of jobs, so 'unemployment' may be considered eradicated. Additionally, consider cliques. Within a school hierarchy, factions will form rapidly from cliques. How would they get food and clean water? Literally every hypermarket, and grocery store: Wallmart, Costco, Wholefoods, TraderJoes, etc. Locally for your area: Brookshire Grocery Company, Cannata's Family Market, Lakeview Grocery, Mac's Fresh Market, Market Basket, etc... Anyone near farms have direct access and likely knowledge to grow their own food. Similarly, they can easily form a trade community or become exploited by larger communities. Anyone with technical know-how, may suggest filtration devices, which may be obtained from any of the hypermarkets listed above. Would they figure out how to harness electricity? How? Yes. Anyone who has a generator already knows the basics: put fuel in, press a button, electricity. At a grander scale, anyone with an interest in electronics or electrical systems has libraries of knowledge at their disposal. I suspect if it becomes an issue, schools may devote joint resources to maintain existing electrical structures; however, they'll run into issues with respect to the size of utility companies. Additionally, there will be edge cases with access to renewable energy (hydro, wind, solar), in which case, their requirements would be much relaxed, but their electrical draw highly limited. In particular I'd be concerned for the order of failure of large scale systems. Local and Oil will automatically shut down when they run out of fuel. Nuclear systems, if automated, will automatically insert rods when the reactions get to hot; but, depending on the software, may either shut down the reaction for good, or attempt to maintain it indefinitely. Either way the nuclear plants will slowly lose potency. Given your region (which I'm not familiar with), I wonder if there are any hydroelectric sources. They'd be capable of producing electricity for a few years without maintenance. After that though, they'd require major maintenance upkeep to maintain capacity. How would their society advance if there were no adults to teach them? That's simple: a disease wiped out all adults but left the infrastructure entirely intact! Every single library, repository, and computer is up for grabs. All of those script-kiddies and amateur programmers now have free reign across the internet. Every bookworm has access to libraries without late-fees! The minute an interim government forms, a demand for knowledge will predicate the need to obtain and maintain these knowledge centers. What might their self-government be like? As I stated before, I suspect the SGA geeks would attempt to form a government; however, they will be competing against oligarchical structures forming around delinquents and individuals who seek dictoral control. On a larger scale, we'd see all three forming. The question then becomes: which ones succeed faster? My expectation is that the delinquent run oligarchies would rapidly form classic raid parties in post-apocalyptic scenarios. The tyrannical and SGA democratic communities would recognize the need for forming communities and putting talent to work on rebuilding and maintaining said community; but, the exact labor structure will vary greatly. I can see any number of labor structures rising: serfdom from cliques, technocracy in city communities, etc. Secondly, they would also come into conflict due to differences in ideology and diplomacy. How they handle it is up to you. How would those "in charge" assert control? How do children typically assert control? Bullying and Humiliation, or through sheer numbers and popular support. If a delinquent or tyrant gets their hands on a gun, sheer terror will reign until they are disposed. In more democratic settings, sheer popular support may keep tyrants from gaining power. More importantly I suspect, is guns. The minute someone gets smart and amasses weapons, they immediately have the power of life over death of their peers. Depending on how they choose to distribute this (if at all) any variation of tyrannical or democratic power structures may form. How would they deal with simple things such as toilets and laundry? That depends: how long will those infrastructure remain active without supervision? And how long will toiletry supplies last? Would they revert to a previous time period? I doubt it considering all technology and infrastructure would remain untouched. Give the 18yo 5-10 years of self-studying and on-the-job learning w/o supervision and I'm confident they'll be able to reclaim much of our technology and infrastructure. Other issues I think this also provides an opportunity for you to write about how children will act without the threat of adult consequences. Sexist and patriarchal men will rape women. Bullies will unleash holy hell without due regard for consequences. Victims would outright murder those who injured them Children would run amok until someone gets hurt. 17-18 year olds will find themselves thrust with the responsibility of adulthood when they were only recently looking forward to college (studying, travelling, or partying).
