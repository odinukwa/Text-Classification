The statement seems to follow from Sperner's lemma. We will give such a coloring that the first few elements are red, the middle ones are green and the last few are blue (for any ordering of the elements). We can represent the colorings of the $n$ elements with a subdivision of a large triangle into $n^2$ smaller triangles in the standard way, where the side lengths of the small triangles are $1$, while the side lengths of the large triangle are $n$. Express the vertices of the small triangles using barycentric coordinates. All barycentric coordinates will be of the form $\frac{r_v}n,\frac{g_v}n,\frac{b_v}n$, where $r_v$, $g_v$ and $b_v$ are non-negative integers. To each vertex $v$, assign a coloring of the elements, $C(v)$, where $r_v$, $g_v$ and $b_v$ elements are red, green and blue, respectively. Now we define the colors of the vertices (which will be used in Sperner's lemma). A vertex $v$ is colored red if in $C(v)$ for at least $k/3$ sets we have that $r_i\ge m_i$. (Attention, there is no $-1$!) A vertex is colored green if it is not red, and in $C(v)$ for at least $k/3$ sets we have that $g_i\ge m_i$. A vertex is colored blue if it is not red or green, and in $C(v)$ for at least $k/3$ sets we have that $b_i\ge m_i$. Note that every vertex gets colored and the coloring satisfies the conditions of Sperner's lemma. Therefore, we get a $3$-colored small triangle. But it is easy to see that any of its vertices will give a coloring $C(v)$ that satisfies the required conditions. Update: Oops, as pointed out by Dap, the "easy to see part" is incorrect (as usual ;). One possible fix is to use real coordinates, as described by fedja. Another would be to allow multiple colors for each vertex, i.e., the "if it is not red" type conditions should be ignored. For such a multicoloring, Sperner's lemma is still true, and we get a triangle whose vertices contain all 3 colors (some possibly multiple times). And now the "easy to see" part should work because the "danger sets", i.e., the ones for which we have, e.g., $m_i=r_i=g_i$, contribute to multiple color counts, like in this case to both $r_i$ and $g_i$. But I don't see how to finish this workaround without a cumbersome calculation. 

Yes, such a grid can be constructed easily by induction. As can be seen from the answer given to your previous question, the adjacent rows can be chosen arbitrarily. Denote the numbers in these rows by $\ldots,x_{-1},x_0,x_1,\ldots$ and $\ldots,y_{-1},y_0,y_1,\ldots$. How does the rest of the grid change if we change $x_0$? The elements that are in the infinite triangle whose sides are the halflines that go North-West and North-East from $x_0$. The coefficients can be also computed, along the sides they are always $\pm x_0$, while inside the triangle some other numbers (possibly $0$). Let us pick the numbers in the order $x_0,x_1,x_{-1},x_2,\ldots$ such that they grow very fast. I claim that this guarantees that all elements of the grid are different. (Let's ignore the $y_i$'s - it's easy to make the argument work for them too.) Suppose that there are two numbers that are equal. For both, take the most significant $x_i$ that influenced them. This will be one that is diagonally South-West or South-East. If these $x_i$ differ, the numbers also differ. If they are the same, then the coefficient of how $x_i$ influences are numbers might be still different. If it's also the same, take the second most significant $x_j$ etc. Sooner or later we get a different $x_j$ or coefficient, and we are done. Note that in the above argument we have used that for any $k$ there are finitely many numbers whose most significant $x_i$ has $|i|\le k$. 

I think the same phenomenon is easier to understand in the Domino Problem. It is undecidable whether a given set can tile the plane or not. This means that if your input is a set, then no algorithm can output the answer. However, for any fixed set, the answer is either Yes or No, so a trivial algorithm (that has no input) answers it. Just in the case of minors, even for a fixed set, we have another input (the graph) and we need Robertson-Seymour. 

Note that the answer is no for $\mathbb Z$ if $s_0=0$ and $S=\{1,2\}$ as shown by coloring odd numbers red and even numbers blue. This particular configuration, however, is easy to find in $\mathbb Q$. 

As Will says, this distribution will be different from any computable distribution in the sense that e.g. its distribution function will not be recursive. However, you can find any distribution in it in the sense that e.g. there is a c such that c times the distribution function of the normal distribution is a lower bound on this distribution function. You should check the Coding theorem and Levin's theorem about lower semi-computable semi-measures. I could find only this link: $URL$ I can also recommend the Lovasz-(Gacs) book: Complexity of Algorithms. 

My question is about type 3. What is the right way to make people know about the result? In my case, in a class I had a student who came up with a proof for a well-known theorem, which was shorter than the one in the textbook and I believe to be new. After many attempts, I gave up reminding the student to write it up. 

Just a note about inscribed polygons. It is easy to show that area$(P^-)\ge$ area$(P)(1-1/(n-2))$. This follows from the fact that among the triangles formed by three vertices of $P$, (at least) one with minimum area must ``lie'' on a side of $P$. (Proof: Take minimum area triangle, use area$\cdot 2=$ height$\cdot$base and move vertices.) Now triangulate $P$ such that this minimum area triangle appears. Omitting it we get a polygon with $n-1$ vertices, done. This bound is also sharp for regular $n$-gons. (Proof is again by moving the vertices of maximum area $(n-1)$-gon. I guess the next task is to determine the minimum of area$(P^+)/$area$(P)$. 

Here by subKneser graph $KG(3k,k)$ I mean a subgraph induced by $3k$ of the $n$ elements. So if the vertices of $KG(n,k)$ are $\binom Sk$ where $|S|=n$, then the vertices of $KG(3k,k)$ should be $\binom {S'}k$ where $S'\subset S$ such that $|S'|=3k$. The question is related to the three disjoint equivoluminous subsets problem, which is related to the polymath10 project. 

If the poset is a power set, then the answer is $2^{{n \choose n/2}(1-o(1))}$. A brief history of the problem: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

Suppose we have a graph G. Is it true that we can map its vertices to the plane such that when connecting neighboring vertices with segments, then any induced cycle of G that has length at least 4 will have two edges that intersect? What if I want each induced cycle of length at least 4 to be in a non-convex position? (If we write a bigger number instead of 4, then this would be some kind of strengthening of the theorem of Erdos-Szekeres.) What if I want k induced cycles that do not intersect (any other or themselves)? I suspect that the answer to all these questions is negative, i.e. there is a graph that we cannot linearly map with ruining all its induced cycles. I would also be very interested in any related results. *Update March 19. I realized that I can show that there is a dense graph whose embedding will have an induced $C_4$ in convex position (whose edges might intersect). For a proof sketch, see my answer. *Update April 3. Now I realized that if the graph is sparse in the sense that its degeneracy is constant, then its chromatic number is also constant, in which case we can put the vertices that belong to the same color class close to each other, which would mean that it is not possible to have too many disjoint cycles. So a graph with a linear number of edges has a drawing with at most a constant number of disjoint cycles. *Remaining Question. Is there a method that guarantees non-crossing cycle(s) and does not use a counting argument but rather some topology? 

Yes. If you take the complement of your graph, then you get the clique density problem, which was solved recently: $URL$ 

If you divide the vertex set into 3 parts, A, B and C, with respective sizes $an$, $bn$ and $cn$, and add all the edges except the ones connecting two vertices inside A and a vertex from A and C, then you get a graph with $\delta=bn$ and $|E|=(1-{a^2}-2ac) {n\choose 2}$. If $b<a$, you won't have a triangle-decomposition as for any 2 edges between A and B you need an edge inside B but there aren't enough. If $a=b$, then $c=1-2a$ and $|E|=(1+3{a^2}-2a) {n\choose 2}$, solving which to get $\frac 34{n\choose 2}$ edges we get that $a=\frac 12$ or $\frac 16$. As you've noted of the former in your comment, it can only give slightly less than $\frac 34{n\choose 2}$ edges, so we gotto go with $a=b=\frac 16$ and $c=\frac 23$ which gives (your) $c=\frac 16$. I am not sure if you can also achieve $\frac 34$ with a similar example but I would not be surprised.
