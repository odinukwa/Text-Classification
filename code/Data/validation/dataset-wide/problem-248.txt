Think of productivity as the number of people working it takes to support everyone. Our standards of living can increase across the board as long as our productivity increases proportionally. That is, if some new innovation makes everyone twice as productive, we can basically double living standards for everyone. Likewise, we can reduce the number of people working as long as the people who are working are proportionally more productive. That is, if some new innovation makes everyone twice as productive, we can maintain living standards by having half as many people work. Then imagine how your society falls on this scale. Essentially robots have made productivity go off the charts. How that productivity gets used is what will dictate your answer. 

There are indeed natural objects (called Trojans) captured in Jupiter's L4 and L5 bands. One gotcha is that for planets the size of Jupiter to form at all, they must be out of the habitable zone. Closer to the habitable zone (our side of the Asteroid Belt) causes dense rocky planets to form, but the solar winds that close to the Sun blow away the massive clouds of dust and gas that compose Jupiter and all of the gaseous planets. (Parenthetically, this formation pattern is why many don't consider Pluto a planet. It's more likely a captured foreign object.) According to Wikipedia article on Lagrangian points: 

This has been mentioned in a few other places, but it's possible that the fields that machines aren't able to do well, like music or art, would just... expand. If there's tons of wealthy people who have easy access to the things that robots can do, what do they do with their disposable income? Hire yourself an artist, or spend way more time going to things artists do. Get a nanny, or heck, get two. Maybe machines can handle fairly boring food for everyone, like going to eat at Ruby Tuesdays or something, but what people really want is their own human chef to show off to their friends! Or maybe even new jobs we can't imagine? Could Luddites have envisioned computer programming jobs? Maybe it becomes en vogue to have your own personal self-esteem person, who follows you around and tells you how great you are at every turn. Increased Productivity 

A much shorter answer that the rest, but a good point I think: Theocracy is a form of government with a god as its ruler. Logically, a world where gods are powerful and apparent would lead to there being few atheists, but that doesn't mean gods must rule (every) society. On the contrary, if the gods desire worship, I think those worshiping sincerely and not under compulsion of law would be more pleasing to (at least some of) them. Some more egotistical gods may, of course, establish a nation for themselves, but only because it gives them glory among mortals. They already have power, which is what rulers and tyrants typically seek when establishing kingdoms. 

I think the best way to think of this is not as something that started in the future; it really started in the industrial revolution and just kept going. In the early 1800s there was a group in England called the Luddites, who went around smashing machinery they thought was taking their jobs. The term is even synonymous with someone who doesn't use/like technology. And the thing is, there's a lot of evidence that those machines really were taking their jobs. But far from being the end of the world, the labor market slowly adjusted. Some people lost their jobs, but others got new jobs that hadn't existed before. On top of that, everyone got more and cheaper goods. The world you're describing would have been the result of a very long, multi-century (or millennia if you're far enough in the future) process. There would have been lots of periods of adjustment, likely often accompanied by upheaval such as the Luddites, or the decline of the middle class we're glimpsing now. Labor as an Exit from Poverty 

It's possible, as other answers indicate, to convert kinetic force into electricity, so I won't repeat that. But what you should think about is the cost-benefit ratio. The truth is, it's not feasible to add the complexity of an extra subsystem to an already ridiculously complex system. Think of the amount of electricity it takes to accelerate anything to several times the speed of sound. Power savings from a kinetic converter would simply be insignificant. 

If you are willing to sacrifice those types of orbits and the habitable zone, consider a world like this: Jupiter's moon Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, making its surface uncharacteristically hot for where it is. The tidal forces that Jupiter and Europa enact on it cause the activity. Although Io is a harsh and toxic environment (with all the sulfur and volcanoes and whatnot), you could entertain a scenario with milder heating, making it warm enough to be have liquid water. Given the lack of sunlight, perhaps the creatures on the planet evolved to use chemosynthesis, like some of the animals that live near sulfur vents on the ocean floor? Who says that the "habitable zone" is the only place that can support life? This is where the fiction in Science Fiction comes in, and where it gets fun :) 

If robots are so good at everything that they've entirely replaced low-skilled labor, it's likely that manufactured stuff is cheap. You say people still need to work to get by, but how cheap would it be to send a bunch of construction robots over to whip up a new tenement when needed? They don't need breaks or lunch hours, don't go on strike, presumably make near-zero mistakes, and don't particularly worry about their own safety. Are massive farming operations completely automated by these same tireless robots? What does that do to food prices? And so on. It seems very likely to me that a subsistence level of living would be widely available. Large swaths of people would probably be miserable due to a lack prospects for upward mobility, but they almost certainly don't lack for basic necessities. Shifting Labor Market 

You are talking about a literal unicorn. Some creative license is allowed. Electrocuting itself isn't a problem for the same reason it isn't a problem in real-world electricity-generating animals: their bodies are adapted to it as a natural function. If you really must include some vague science, say that there are at least two separate organs, or parts to the single organ, that generates the electricity: a low-voltage power supply and a transformer. Stun guns ramp up quite low voltages (household batteries, maybe 20 volts at most) to tens of thousands of volts to make their sparks. The unicorn has a structure that, in addition to simply generating a current, transforms that current into a higher voltage, accumulates a charge over short amounts of time and releases it in bursts. (Note that most of what we see as sparks, lightning included, are bursts of accumulated charges and not continuous streams). Hope this helps! 

One thing your world might suffer from is a lack of a way out of poverty. In the US, low-skill trades like the auto industry were a path to the middle class for millions. Later those jobs moved to places where people work for much lower wages. There's actually some evidence in development economics that China is currently "clogging" this path for everyone else; if you're a small poor country somewhere interested in expanding manufacturing for your people, how are you going to compete with China, and particularly their infrastructure? So maybe in your world no countries that didn't already escape from poverty can find a way out. They're just poor countries that stay afloat on volatile commodities markets and international aid - only now the thing blocking their way out isn't China, it's that the entire world has cheap robot labor. Cheap Stuff 

If they are intelligent enough to have language faculties, then as the other answers say, they are simply undead humans. As dangerous as humans, and possibly more so if they aren't restricted by the weaknesses of human biological systems. But the question becomes, at that point, what issues do your room-temperature humans have with higher-than-room-temperature humans? If zombies are intelligent enough to think freely, what unites them against normal humans? Why wouldn't their allegiances to their country, family (undead or still living), or religion trump anything else, especially if they were once a normal human? Sure, you might have a terrorist zombie here or there, but what reason do intelligent creatures (on the whole) have to want to see the world of normal humans fall?
