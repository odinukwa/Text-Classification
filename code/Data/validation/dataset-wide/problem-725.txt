I have had SPDs and eggbeaters, and I love the Crank Bros eggbeater pedals. I've found them to be way better than SPDs. You can clip in on four sides rather than two, and in my experience, they're easier to clip out of in emergency situations than SPDs are. Also, unlike SPDs, eggbeaters don't have flat surfaces, so you're less likely to slip off if you're trying to get back on after hike-a-bike sections of muddy trails. 

Because spokes stretch a little and settle in after you start riding, be prepared to true the wheel after the first couple rides. If you are not interested in making your own wheel, I recommend just buying a new wheel with the hub you want. It may be cheaper than getting your lbs to rebuild your wheel with your new hub. 

Always be careful about carbon fiber and collisions. Carbon fiber is light and strong, but it's very fragile and can break unexpectedly because you can't always see the cracks. In one of my collegiate mtb short track races, a guy snapped his carbon fiber handlebar at the stem after a 1' drop because the handlebar took abuse over time. When it lost all strength, the effect on the equipment was catastrophic. So in your case, if the crash was strong enough to throw you over the hood of the car to the other side, it probably messed up the carbon fork, even if you can't see it. When riding bikes, I've found the fork to be particularly useful, so certainly have the fork checked out, but be prepared to junk it for your own safety. 

Can a distinction be made between highway/rural riding and city riding? I have little experience in large city riding, but I grew up in the sparsely populated Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and find it rather 'common sense' to ride against traffic on two lane highways with shoulders. 

If your bearings are decent, just take the non-drive pedal off and let the pedal weight pull the other side down, or slowly let it fall from slightly off center. This is how I could tell with my Bullseye cranks, besides hopping on and trying to pedal it. If that doesn't work then I'd try tying a heavy weight or looping a paint can around one of the pedals close to the crank. You're looking for a 7.5 degree distance, so on 185mm cranks that's 24mm or nearly and inch of diference between splines. Weighting the opposite side enough should make it clear. I then took some nail polish and marked both the crank and axle so I didn't have to play this game again. 

Not only do the leading/trailing spokes lay nicely next to each other, it appears to have the following properties: 

This happens commonly on vehicle/motorcycle tires, and for similar reasons. Non-bicycle tires use woven metal 'bands' that form the structure, with rubber molded around them. Bicycle tires use cloth/nylon/some other type of non-stretchy material with the rubber molded around it. You can usually feel them as the lines inside the tire. When bands break and/or separate, it allows air pressure to push out the now unsupported rubber around it out farther than normal. You may not even notice the inner part following, because they're not really one piece, more like two pieces of bread surrounding the meat (the bands). Further, they don't need to make both sections airtight, so usually just the outside is (even if you don't see holes, the rubber can be quite permeable (indeed it usually is to a small extent, even airtight ones). If you're asking what causes the breaking, it could be poor manufacturing, extreme flexing, folding, extreme heat, sitting flat on the bead for a while (or getting ridden on while flat), over-inflation, or any number of things that stress one section of the tire more than the rest of the structure. 

The 2000 miles is an estimate of when the chain will stretch. Your chain may last longer than that. As far as replacing it goes, I think it depends on your financial situation. If you can easily afford a new chain, I recommend buying one. A replaced chain means that you don't have to worry about your current chain stretching beyond the limit and damaging your bike. If your budget makes buying a new chain difficult, you'll be all right to keep riding. Just check the chain stretch every so often to determine when it's getting near absolutely necessary to buy a chain. 

My grandpa gave me his old 1974 Raleigh International (all original Campy) as a graduation present. Since the stock wheels are for tubular tires, and I do want to ride it around town, I want to get wheels for clincher tires so I can change the inner tube when I flat rather than having to mess with glue jobs. A new rear wheel means that I can have an option of getting a rear wheel with shimano hyperglide so I can choose modern cassettes. Because the shifters are friction shifters rather than indexed shifters, does it matter how many cogs are in the cassette? Do I have to stick with 5 or could I even go to 10? I stand corrected that the frame is steel and not alumninum. I was mistaken because the bike is significantly lighter than other steel-framed bikes I have dealt with. I apologize for this error. 

Make sure you take the quick release skewer out before you use that tool, don't use it EXACTLY like the picture. You should center it on the dish. 

In my estimation, the initial section was just lockup during heaving brake application during the descent (stopping as much as possible, and desiring more stopping force than the friction of the tire has to offer causing lockup). The lockup during the slide looks to have been done for more of a cool move, similar to using the parking brake to slide in a car. More cornering force can be applied from a non-locked wheel, so if his desire was to corner better then he wouldn't lock (intentionally). However, this could also just be the rider's 'style', or by contrast, completely unintentional, as motives are hard to discern from actions. I'm just basing this on my own trail riding; I do occasionally lock up unintentionally on descents, but sliding sideways is typically intentional. 

If you're interested in some custom work, you could put a Y-Connector in the lines for hydraulic brakes - assuming of course that you have hydraulic brakes and they make hydraulic road levers. 

The problem I'm having is in relocating the seat post clamp beneath the top tube. I have cut a vertical I shape under the top tube in the steel frame so that it can collapse into the post. If I remember correctly, it's a 28.6mm OD seatpost with a 31.6mm or so OD (a bit more now with a coat of Herculiner). Right now I'm using 2x Problem Solvers cable clamps, but I cannot get them tight enough to stop the seatpost from dropping a bit, and if I go any tighter I'm in danger of stripping them out. I'd also prefer a quick release to be able to take it out without an allen wrench. Does anyone make Quick Release clamps that split to get around my top tube? The best I can find so far is this, but I have to lose any quick release features: 2 piece split clamp $URL$ Does something like this exist already, and I'm reinventing the wheel? Or is there some way I could use two quick release levers on the split clamp? 

I think if you are willing to spend a few hours, it's worth doing yourself. Depending on the flange size of the new hub, though, you may need to buy new spokes. You can determine the length of the spokes you will need using a spoke length calculator. You will need a spoke wrench, a flat-head screwdriver, some vaseline, and the use of a truing stand. Here's what you'll have to do: 

Remove the tire, innertube, and rim tape from the wheel. Using a spoke wrench, loosen and remove the nipples. If you are using the same spokes, remove the spokes from the old hub. Lace the wheel, making ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that the valve will be in the right place. Check out Sheldon Brown's step-by-step wheelbuilding page for the procedure of lacing a 3x (three-cross) wheel. You will want to use a little bit of vaseline on the threads of each spoke so you can tighten the nipples more easily. Go to a nearby bicycle cooperative (you can google bicycle co-op near nameofyourtown) to use a truing stand, and use the truing stand to adjust the wheel. Make sure the wheel is dished properly and that you have proper tension on the spokes. 

I strongly recommend socks that can breathe easily and that absorb and wick away sweat. That means probably not cotton athletic socks you'd get in bulk at a warehouse store. Personal preference determines the coloration and logos, and if you're worried about style, get socks that match your kit and your shoes. Also if your alma mater has a cycling team, contact them and see if you can buy team socks. You'll be able to show school pride wherever you're riding, and they'll be quality. 

After I fried a my first pair from water getting in by the buttons and USB port, I put black electrical tape over the buttons and seam, and they are now effectively waterproof. The battery life is 2.5-3 hours, and they record to my 16GB MicroSD card, which can then be put right into my computer. The two buttons are easy to find and press (even under the tape). 

I'm new to road bicycles, sorry if this question is beat to death. What I'm wondering is what to measure as far as frame clearance, rim width, etc. to put the 'widest tires that will fit' on my road bike for durability purposes? The bike is more or less a glorified BSO, and because of this I can't find any real specifications other than the amazon.com page: $URL$ Victory Vision Road Bike $URL$ The ones that came on it are unmarked, but appear to be 27mm or 28mm, the rim width is 25mm. How do I know whether 32mm or larger will fit before buying them, without rubbing and such? 

The second looks smaller and lighter, and comes with longer bolts and rounded washers that go through both the brakes and the adapter and into the 160mm post mount. 

There is one other aspect that has not yet been addressed: shifters. Shimano and SRAM use different technologies for the rear derailleur. Most SRAM has a 1:1 actuation ratio, which means that the length of cable moved by the shifters is identical to the horizontal movement of the derailleur. However, all Shimano uses a 2:1 actuation ratio, which means that twice as much cable has to be moved as horizontal movement of the derailleur. If you have Shimano shifters, you must get a Shimano rear derailleur. But if you have SRAM shifters that are X-series (X-4, X-5, X-7, X-9, X-0), you must get a SRAM rear derailleur. This is a concern only for the rear derailleur and not for the front derailleur. 

External bottom brackets have been appearing on higher-end bikes in the last few years. Can older bikes with bottom bracket shells that come stock with square taper internal ISO 68mm or oversized ISO 73mm bottom brackets be retrofitted with external cups when it comes time to replace the bottom bracket? I am well aware that the cranks will have have to be replaced, too. 

Communication is key. I have a cowbell I attach to my bike when riding on trails so people know that a bike is coming. Or that a cow is speeding toward them. Either way, the trails I go on are vacant, save for the occasional hiker, and they're often courteous enough to move off the trail in order to let me go by. I thank them as I pass by because hikers do have the right of way. When hikers hold their ground, I have to clip out, go to the side of the singletrack path, and then lean my bike as far as I can toward the brush so the hikers can get by my handlebar. Is it bothersome to yield to hikers? Absolutely. But I think crashing into someone is worse. Especially with all the lawyers here in California. 

I use a sort of wave, raising my hand but with no movement in it (so not a 'Hey buddy' or 'I need help' side to side movement).... it works on my bicycle, on my motorcycle, and while driving a vehicle. It's got somewhat of a dual purpose: acknowledgement that I did something wrong, and/or 'thanks for letting me in' gratitude gesture. The motorcycle I find a very odd case of this. It's 95% not me giving the gesture, but receiving it after being cut off, not seen, turned in front of, etc. People are in general not interested in showing any rage and are quick to apologize when I'm on one, even if I'm not wearing the armored jacket and helmet. I don't get even half this respect in vehicles or bicycles. That was a side note that I've found interesting, but the point is that it's the same gesture I seem to get from many other people. There's no side/side or waving motion, just a hand up, fingers together, "Thanks/Sorry". 

I am a mountain biker now living in Minneapolis and so I bought a road bike, but I can't keep tires on it to save my life. I 'upgraded' to Continental Attack/Force tires, got a glass shard in the rear, and now just went over a pothole that popped both the front Continental and rear stock tires. I haven't even been able to even ride a mile on it. At this point, I'll take heavier wheels with more rolling resistance just to be actually able to ride. Does anyone make solid rubber or non-pneumatic tires for 700c wheels? These look neat, but they aren't being produced yet: 

From my experience racing USAC Collegiate xc and short track, disc brakes are the way to go, and I prefer hydraulic to mechanical, as long as they're the right model. You can find a lot of reviews on the mtbr.com forum about disc brakes to find one that would work for you. The Avid Elixir R SLs I use on my full-suspension mtb have never let me down and are easy to adjust. From general riding experience, disc brakes are much more responsive in dusty and wet situations than v-brakes are. Disc brakes provide another advantage during race situations: If you flat during a race, you just have to flip your bike over, open the quick-release and pull the wheel off. Since disc brakes don't go around the tire like rim brakes do, you don't have to disengage or reengage the brakes when you pull the wheel off or put it back on. Also if you're running rim brakes and you hit a rock during a race that makes your wheel go out of true, your rim will be hitting the brake pads while you ride, which can end your hopes of placing. With disc brakes, your braking power is not affected by the trueness of the wheel. You'll probably want to true the wheel when you get back to your tent, but your race isn't over if you're running discs. 

Schrader valves are stronger, for one. Breaking a weaker, smaller valve that has a (perhaps just in my experience) frustrating attachment mechanism for pumps on a $1,000+ fork would be unacceptable. Road Bicycles Schrader valves have at least one valid disadvantage on a road bicycle: their larger diameter is a deterrent for use because it reduces the strength of the rim significantly on a narrow-rimmed bicycle wheel (the main point), they use a spring that can wear out to hold their own pressure where Presta valves hold their own (ancillary point, if one at all) and are slightly heavier (retroactive justification from the Presta preachers). None of these matter for a shock. High-end road bikes were designed for one thing: going fast. Their rim material takes an enormous amount of additional stress from the smaller width, higher inflation rates of the tires, and simultaneously have as much weight, material, and spokes taken away as possible to leave a somewhat durable wheel. In this setup, the hole diameter DOES make a sizable chunk out of the material and strength of the rim, and the smaller diameter allows for more performance and smaller width, lighter weight rims, and so is 'the thing' in the higher end models. Only a 6mm diameter hole is drilled vs an 8mm hole for a schrader. Non-road Bicycles Don't confuse 'costs more' with 'better'. In the mountain bicycle / BMX / downhill / trials / non-road bike world, the high end bikes are not all presta. Most utility bicycles (even expensive ones) are schrader for the convenience. They're more of an irrelevant (performance-wise) selection of what the rider wants on these types of bicycles. This isn't because they're skimping in other areas, but the Schrader vs Presta debate doesn't really matter when the rim is wide enough to compensate for the larger hole that must be drilled. Other Applications Also note that Schrader valves are much, much, much more common. They're used in refrigerant systems (both on your fridge in your home and in your vehicle's A/C system), plumbing test ports, pneumatic systems, hydraulic systems, and in many other industrial applications as well. I have never seen a presta valve that is not on a bicycle (so if industry is using them, they're cleverly hiding them everywhere I look). This makes the cost of design, tooling, and testing a much less costly proposition for the manufacturer (and, in the end, the consumer) - by not having to break the trail for using a less common valve in an application it's not been used before. A fringe benefit of Schraders that may or may not apply in this context is the removable core. When I was a Diesel mechanic the trucks would get ice and dirt lodged in the valve stems, and a simple tool would extract the core, leaving a decent size diameter to expel air, or shove a small screwdriver into to clear debris. Further, if the spring was ever worn, or the seal mechanism not sealing, this core could be replaced without replacing the entire valve stem, and it made depressurizing tires much more tolerable (take the cores out, walk away for five minutes). I couldn't imagine how irritating Presta valves would be. If the seal seat of a presta valve 'wore out', got chipped or otherwise failed on a shock, the whole valve would have to be replaced - which depending on the design, might be a permanent fixture in the shock tubing.
