Let $X$ and $Y$ be affine varieties over $\mathbb C$, and consider a morphism $f:X\to Y$ and the induced homomorhism $$ \varphi=f^*:B=\mathbb C[Y]\to A=\mathbb C[X]. $$ It is very easy to see that if $\varphi$ is surjective then $f$ is injective. The converse is not true, as the inclusion $\mathbb C\setminus\{0\}\to\mathbb C$ shows. My question is: 

Question: Consider the complex simple Lie group $E_6$. Let $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_6$ be the fundamental weights defining the $27$-dimensional representation $V$ and $V^*$, resp. Consider the complex span $\mathfrak a^*=\langle \lambda_1,\lambda_6\rangle$. The subquotient of the Weyl group $W=W(E_6)$ that acts on $\mathfrak a^*$ is $\Gamma:=N_W(\mathfrak a^*)/Z_W(\mathfrak a^*)=A_2$.

(English summary) The 2000 Twente Conference on Lie Groups (Enschede). Acta Appl. Math. 73 (2002), no. 1-2, 103â€“113. As commented by the authors, there seems to be some trouble to deal with the case of arbitrary spherical varieties. 

$X=G_2/U_2$, $Aut^0(X)=SO_7(\mathbb C)$. $X=Sp_r/Sp_{r-1}U_1$, $Aut^0(X)=PSL_{2r}(\mathbb C)$. $X=SO_{2r+1}/U_r$, $Aut^0(X)=PSO_{2r+2}(\mathbb C)$. 

I cannot resist but mention a related concept, which in a sense generalizes the example you quote. Let a Lie group $G$ act properly and isometrically on the complete Riemannian manifold $M$. The action is called polar if there exists a complete connected submanifold $\Sigma$ that meets all the orbits, and meets them always orthogonally. Such a submanifold $\Sigma$ is called a section. It is easy to see that a section must be totally geodesic. If an action admits a section which is flat in the induced metric, then this action is called hyperpolar. In the case of linear orthogonal actions (or representations), there is no distinction between polar and hyperpolar actions since the complete totally geodesic submanifolds of Euclidean space are its affine subspaces. One example of polar representation which is very familiar from basic courses in linear algebra is the $SO(n)$-conjugation of $n\times n$ real symmetric matrices. It is well known that every symmetric matrix is orthogonally conjugate to a diagonal matrix, so here the section is given by the subspace of diagonal matrices. More generally, the standard examples of polar representations are the isotropy representations of symmetric spaces. Conversely, Dadok has shown that these essentially exhaust all the examples. The orbital foliation of a polar action has many remarkable geometric and topological properties. The story starts with Bott and Samelson in the 1950's and goes on. To mention a recent result, A. Lytchak and G. Thorbergsson have proven that the orbifold points of the orbit space of a proper and isometric action correspond precisely to the points of the manifold where the slice representation is polar (J. Differential Geom.85 (2010), 117-140). Polar actions have also been generalized in many directions, e.g. polar foliations, complex actions, Hilbert space. I leave you with two book references: $URL$ (link to free book) and J. Berndt, S. Console and C. Olmos, Submanifolds and Holonomy, CRC/Chapman and Hall Research Notes Series in Mathematics 434 (2003), Boca Raton (more recent book). *Edit:*Ah, I forgot to mention one detail. In your example, you removed the origin to get a second foliation by radial lines. For a polar action, the orbits form a (singular) foliation of course, but the sections form a foliation only if you remove the singular orbits. In fact, a point in the manifold lies in an orbit of lower dimension precisely if it is contained in more than one section. 

Geometric proof: A connected Lie group $G$ is homotopy equivalent to a maximal compact subgroup, so we may assume $G$ is compact. Being compact, $G$ admits a bi-invariant Riemannian metric with respect to which it is a symmetric space, the symmetry $s$ at the identity being just the inversion map. Now a homotopy class in $\pi_1(G,1)$ can be represented by a closed geodesic $\gamma$ (of minimal length in its homotopy class, by a shortening process). Since the differential of $s$ at $1$ is minus identity, $s$ sends $\gamma$ to itself parametrized backwards. It follows that the homomorphism induced by $s$ on the $\pi_1$-level is inversion. However, the inversion map in a group is a homomorphism if and only if the group is Abelian. 

A simply-connected compact Lie group $G$ has the same rational homotopy type (and rational cohomology ring) of as a product of odd-dimensional spheres $S^{2m_1+1}\times\cdots\times S^{2m_r+1}$ where the $m_i$ are invariants called exponents and $r$ is the rank of $G$. (The exponents are related to many algebraic invariants of $G$). In your case $U(n)$ is diffeomorphic to $S^1 \times SU(n)$ and the exponents of $SU(n)$ are $1,\ldots, n-1$. For instance, in case $n=3$, $SU(3)$ has exponents $1$, $2$ and $U(3)\sim S^1 \times S^3 \times S^5$ has a cell decomposition with one cell in each dimension $0$, $1$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $8$, $9$. Classical references are A. Borel $URL$ and H. Samelson $URL$ Edit: There is the maybe easier following argument. In general, for a (locally trivial) fiber bundle $\pi:E\to B$ with typical fiber $F$, where $B$ and $F$ are CW-complexes, a cell decomposition for the total space $E$ is the same as that of the direct product $B\times F$, since each cell $c$ of $B$ is contractible and thus the bundle above it is trivial: $\pi^{-1}(c)\cong c\times F$. Now consider the (principal) fiber bundle $SU(n-1)\to SU(n)\to S^{2n-1}$ for $n\geq2$ and apply induction. Edit 2: The minimal number of cells in a CW-decomposition equals the sum of the Betti numbers over $\mathbf Z_2$ (or any field), by the Morse inequalities. We need only to know that $G$ and $S^{2m_1+1}\times\cdots\times S^{2m_r+1}$ have the same $\mathbf Z_2$-Betti numbers, so the minimal number of cells in this case is $2^r$, where $r$ is the rank of $G$. 

The case $m=p$, which includes the case of symmetric matrices, is simpler in that the system has the same number of equations as variables and one can solve it uniquely whenever $v$ satisfies $\det(\langle X_j\cdot v_0,X_i\cdot v\rangle)\neq0$, thus yielding a rational map $\Phi:V\to\mathbf R^p$, $v\mapsto (x_1,\ldots,x_p)$. In the case $m>p$, one needs to analyse more carefully the system. The construction depends on the choices of a regular point $v_0\in V$ and a basis $X_1,\ldots,X_m$ of $\mathfrak g$, but presumably not in an essential way. Back to the case of $n\times n$ symmetric matrices, one can write $\Phi$ explicitly, but the formulae for general $n$ seem not to tell much. The case $n=2$ is very simple, as has been pointed out by the OP: taking $v_0$ to be the diagonal matrix with entries $(1,-1)$ we get $\Phi(a_{ij})=2a_{12}/(a_{11}-a_{22})$. 

This seems to be a pretty standard definition. The complex gradient vector field of a complex valued smooth function $u$ with respect to $h$ is the dual of $\bar\partial u$ with respect to $h$, namely, it is characterized by $\bar\partial u(X)=h(\mathrm{grad}u,X)$ for every vector field $X$. Since $\bar\partial u$ is of type $(0,1)$, we have that $\mathrm{grad}u$ is of type $(1,0)$, i.e. $\mathrm{grad u}$ is a holomorphic vector field. Suppose $M$ is compact. Using a bit of Hodge theory, one sees that a holomorphic vector field is a gradient field if and only if it kills every holomorphic one form. In particular, if a holomorphic vector field has a zero then it is a gradient vector field. If $M$ is simply-connected (or more generally $h^{0,1}(M,\mathbf C)=0$) then every holomorphic vector field is a gradient field. 

A (compact) torus is a Lie group isomorphic to the product of finitely many circles: $T^n = S^1 \times \cdots \times S^1$. Such groups are extremely important in Lie theory, Differential Geometry, Topological Groups, Harmonic Analysis etc. They can also be characterized as the compact connected Abelian Lie groups. Of course, $S^1$ is the multiplicative group $U(1)$ of units in the field of complex numbers. In some contexts, it is interesting to consider a product of the form $S^3 \times \cdots \times S^3$, where $S^3$ as a Lie group is viewed as the multiplicative (non-Abelian) group $Sp(1)$ of units in the algebra of quaternions. (Also, $S^1$ and $S^3$ are only spheres that are Lie groups.) Is there a name for groups of this kind? I thought of 'quaternionic tori'... 

I think it is sufficient to assume that $G$ is a connected Lie group. It is not necessary to assume that the exponential map is surjective (intuitively because one can follow broken one-parameter groups). In fact, the set $H$ consisting of all $g\in G$ such that $\Phi_g^*\omega=\omega$ is a closed subgroup of $G$. A closed subgroup of a Lie group is a Lie group with the induced topology. What is the Lie algebra of $H$? The assumption that implies that the Lie algebra of $H$ equals the Lie algebra of $G$. In case $G$ is connected, this implies that $H=G$. Edit: Another way to think, perhaps more elementary. $H$ is an (abstract) group. The assumption that $L_{\phi_\chi}(\omega)=0$ for all $\chi\in\mathfrak g$ implies that $H$ contains a neighborhood of the identity, and $G$ (if connected) is generated by any neighborhood of the identity. To see that $H$ contains a neighborhood of the identity, one uses that the exponential map is onto a neighborhood of the identity and computes that (denote $\varphi_t=\Phi_{e^{t\chi}}$): $$\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t=s}\varphi_t^*\omega=\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t=s}(\varphi_{t-s}\varphi_s)^*\omega=\frac{d}{du}\Big|_{u=0}(\varphi_u\varphi_s)^*\omega=\varphi_s^*\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{u=0}\varphi^*_u\omega=0$$ for all $s\in\mathbb R$, so $\varphi_t^*\omega=\omega$ for all $t\in\mathbb R$. 

Consider an orthogonal representation of a compact Lie group $G$ on an Euclidean space $V$. Denote by $H$ a fixed principal isotropy group, which we assume to be non-trivial. Consider the fixed point set $V^H$. As a motivation to my question, recall that $V^H$ contains the normal spaces to the principal orbits it meets. The normalizer of $H$ in $G$, $N(H)$, acts on $V^H$. Let $\bar N = N(H)/H$. The inclusion $V^H\to V$ induces an isometry between quotient metric spaces $V^H/\bar N\to V/G$. There are very many features of the representation $(G,V)$ that can be recovered from the simpler representation $(\bar N,V^H)$, more than I would like to mention now (e.g. Luna-Richardson theorem). My question is whether it is true that there always exists a subgroup $L\subset H$ which is a finitely iterated $\mathbf Z_2$-extension of the identity and gives the same fixed point set, $V^L=V^H$. (This was an assumption in a result I once proved with G. Thorbergsson to get a sufficient condition for the orbits of a representation to be taut in the sense of Morse theory. At that time, we just thought it easier to check this condition directly in the cases we wanted to use our result.) Application: Let $M$ be any $G$-orbit in $V$. Then the fixed point set $M^H$ is an orbit of $\bar N$ in $V^H$. If the result above is true, then $M^H$ can be obtained from $M$ by successively taking fixed points of involutions. It then follows from a theorem of Floyd that the sum of the Betti numbers of $M^H$ with respect to $\mathbf Z_2$-coefficients is less than or equal to the corresponding sum for $M$. In a sense, the topology of $M^H$ is not more complicated than that of $M$.
