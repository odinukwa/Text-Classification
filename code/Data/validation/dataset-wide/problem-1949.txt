You're each responsible for your own actions. But if you are the report author then I'd suggest that you're responsible overall for the correctness of the report (note the lack of blame for any mistakes in that statement). If you were supposed to write an accurate report but didn't then you own the errors that led to that. If someone else is supposed to proof-read reports to catch mistakes then they own the errors in the proof reading process. Both you and the proof reader should spend less time worrying about who gets the blame and more time thinking about how to do your own job better next time. I'm getting the impression that you either work for a company that practices a blame culture, or at least you feel as if you do. In any case, it's more sensible to concentrate on what went wrong and how to fix it than it is to obsess over who, precisely, was at fault. In the meantime, if someone asks you about the error, all you have to do is share with them the draft you presumably have of your original report that doesn't contain the error. 

I think its reasonable to mention in your CV that you're fluent in various languages. For some jobs it might be a large part of what makes you an attractive candidate, in fact. I wouldn't make a thing about the "international schools" in the CV, but I would instead mention that in the covering letter if you feel it adds to your application. Remember that the person is hiring you wants to know how you're going to solve the problem they're hiring someone to help with - if you can't tie something back to that then the space is probably better used for something more relevant. 

I think that most employers these days regard being well groomed in whatever style you choose to wear your hair as more important than the style itself, so for someone who was going bald anyway, a properly shaven head may actually be the better choice anyway. If you're otherwise well presented and behave in a professional manner then I seriously doubt that the majority of employers would even notice a shaven head as anything worth commenting on. If anyone does ask then explain its connected to your personal faith and beliefs. I think that most employers would certainly stop objecting at this point and I'm assuming that if they didn't accept this then you wouldn't want to work for them anyway. 

If I were in your position and I needed something from a different department head's staff I would do the following: 

The statement "the first to give a number loses" is fundamentally wrong. The reality is "the one who doesn't know the value or isn't willing to walk away 'loses'." Rather than trying to nickle and dime the potential employer during salary negotiations, you need to know ahead of time exactly what it is you want. Then you need to be prepared to walk out and not look back if you don't get that amount. You also need to be prepared to be happy with getting that amount, even if they say yes with zero negotiation. If you are desperate, or just have to have this particular job for whatever reason, then you lose. If you don't have a very real sense of your worth, you lose. However, if you understand that there are a lot of companies out there and are capable / willing to spend the time to find the diamond, then you will win. This absolutely requires you to know what the market rates are for what you do. If you have unrealistic expectations - $1m/year for recent college graduate - then you will be 'educated' along the way. 

I know the OP question is about sexual harassment, but that isn't the real issue here. The real problem is that you have had 3 jobs in as many years. That is the objection you need to overcome. I feel the harassment part of the question should be dropped because it's just not material to whether you will stay on at the new location. Ignoring the last place, you took 2 other jobs that you later decided weren't for you. The interviewer is trying to figure out if you've given any actual thought to the job you are applying for or if you are just applying everywhere and taking a position with whoever happens to give you the first offer. When asked the question about why you left those previous locations, your answer needs to focus on why you know this particular job at this particular company is right for you. There is zero benefit to going into any harassment details from your last position. 

No Nobody would know that you were related to that app, outside the company? As the app is already out there, it is out under the company brand. Unless you transfer official ownership of the app to your own account, nothing will change. Another question is whether it will impact your resume, and again, no. Generally, it is normal to not include the names of apps or other softwares on your resume. You will list your company, with a generic "mobile apps" topic. While commenters noted that some companies indeed ask for individual apps you worked on, a good hiring manager should understand that a single developer working on a large, bad, application, is not necessarily the one to blame. You can always use a line like "I worked on this large app XYZ as a personal challenge, but was not in a position to really change what I thought was needed to get it out of its stagnant state. I learned X, Y and Z from that experience." So, don't fret. The thing you should worry about is whether you are landing in a cesspool; a bad brownfield project with disillusioned colleagues, bad political landmines, etc.; but not whether your app store rating will suffer. 

Sure, plenty of people do that. The trick is to encapsulate the things you cannot possibly avoid (meeting other people to talk about work) so that it part of "getting work done". If you actually just want to get mechanical work doled out by a ticket system and never ever talk to anybody, then, as a web developer, you're basically out of luck. You could look into maintenance, low level support (where you hunt for non-spectacular everyday bugs in applications), etc., and carve out a niche for you. Ask for all the boring, mechanical work that most other people are not happy about. Make sure people do not send the stuff to you by phone or mail, but by using a ticket system (you can find good reasons for that which are not related to your social preferences).
