I can see two uses for it: 1) A way to keep records secret until after everyone involved has died. Countries could require all government officials to keep logs and diaries and send them 50-100 years into the future. Hopefully, people would send more accurate reports than they publicize. The downside is that there is no way to prove what was sent, so it might turn out the be hours of nonsense. 2) Trolling the future humans. Set it to send the same two messages to many points in the future. The messages read: 

I told you all these years that microwaving food is bad for you! Ok, so it might not have been microwaves. Maybe it was the GMO food, that hip new sugar-replacement, radiation from screens or some other new-fangled gizmo. Regardless, it turned out to have serious and irreversible side-effects on the health of those generations that were exposed to it from a young age. It took more than 30-40 years for the first effects to show, and medical science is still busy tracking it down to the source, but the damage is done. People are deteriorating at younger ages and a 90 year lifespan is now out of reach for them. If you want things to be even more grim, the change may be genetic and even children not exposed to the bad stuff still carry the damaged genes limiting their lifespans. 

I don't think this would work. The problem is that Halley's comet is about 11 km across, while Earth is 12,740 km, so a thousand times as big. If it were on a Halley-like orbit, there would not be enough time to thaw out all of the ice before it zooms off into deep space again. If it passed really close to the sun, there might be enough melting, but a little variation or an ill-timed solar flare would scorch away any surface life, and the orbit would not be stable in the long run. 

An angry or protective Sperm Whale could do the trick. If it needs to be more exotic/unknown that hasn't had any contact with humans. why would it attack something so dissimilar from anything regularly visiting its habitat? I see three options: 

Just like the first paper bills were promises to pay out a certain amount of gold, the first coins could be minted only in exchange for the promise of a certain amount of food or other resource, witnessed by some village head or elder. Example: Farmer John needs a new hoe to till his land. Smith Paul is willing to make one for John in exchange for a share of John's harvest. John makes a coin out of... clay with a drawing of 3 sacks of grain. Paul and John then proceed to village elder Dave and repeat their agreement in front of him. To validate the coin, Dave bites lightly into it, leaving his distinctive teeth marks on the coin. The coin can now circulate among the locals until harvest time comes around and John trades 3 sacks of grain for his coin back, which he then can destroy (it's worth nothing to himself). Later on, the coins probably wouldn't be destroyed but kept for reuse. This way, coins only get made in roughly equal measure to resources being produced, and could even be destroyed when a holder claims the promised resource. Note: Of course this will only work if the society already has a concept of private ownership. If all the food and such are shared by the community, this will be a VERY hard sell. 

Btw, one more essential thing: the people spend 9 years training in their assigned roles, most of which is spent learning to interpret IKEA manuals. 

List benefits in the job posting that clearly apply to the postliving only. Things like flexible working hours including nights, windowless offices, cut-rate health plans with coverage tailored to your "personal condition", a darkened shuttle bus and a strict policy against smoking, drugs and religious symbols. Anniversary bonuses going up to 1,000 years are also an option, as is an "Ancient Talent Development Program". Schedule all interviews at night with the excuse that you want to get them all done at once, so that you have everyone fresh in your mind. This should scare off some of the human candidates. Adapt your interview questions. Sample questions: "Where do you see yourself in 100 years?" or "Would you be willing to donate blood for our team-building events?" 

Given the force of the waves going around, I think any land not on the poles will have been eroded long ago, which probably explains the fairly uniform submerged land we saw in Interstellar. Now a lot would depend on the tilt of the planet's axis relative to its orbit. If the axis is perpendicular, the poles would be fairly safe and stable, as the water is being pulled away from the poles toward the equator. Mammals could have evolved there, either living in caves or very resistant to all the radiation the black hole's accretion disc would produce. As Jane S mentioned, the edge of the land would be a big focus for them, scavenging for food and resources along the tide pools left behind by the daily waves. Things get more interesting if the axis is tilted differently. This would mean that there are seasons during which the poles are submerged to a different degree. Our Summer/winter might be their flooding season and spring/autumn their dry season. I imagine this would lead to seasonal spreading out onto the drying land, grazing herds/gathering food, then retreating to the highest mountains to sit out the flooding again. These seasons might only last a short time if the planet's orbital period is very short. Ultimately, all the land would disappear, as the waves erode the edge of the polar land and the currents wash the sand towards the equator, raising the sea level, etc. If the species already achieved some level of technology, they probably have built undersea habitats or sturdy floating rafts. Some more ideas: 

Your world becomes "Abortion-world", "Baby-killing-world" or "Bloody-sex-world". The core of the problem is that getting all women pregnant means death for the men because of the diminishing returns. This needs to be solved one way or another. The somewhat gross but non-nightmare way would be for the men to only have sex with the women during their menstruation, assuming they still have one. If this has the same diminishing returns as sex-while-pregnant, it will not work. The next way is to abort 90% or more of all pregnancies as soon as they are detected. That way things can be back to normal before the men reach 30+15+7.5 etc. days. The final way is to start killing men, boys and male babies, until the ratio men-women (of age 15+) is about 1:10. Then each man can have sex with one of his 10 wives every 30 days and the last one should have given birth by the time it's her turn again. You can bet that the strongest and most violent men will pass on their genes in this scenario, completely changing their world from how ours developed. 

Each of the successive tallest buildings of the world has been designed to the limits of current materials and architectural knowledge. As our science advances, that limit will slowly go up. Thucydides link is very enlightening in that regard. The current record holder, the Burj Khalifa, could probably not have been built 10 years earlier. As the buildings grow taller, the complexities and especially costs increase. All of the tallest skyscrapers are giant "mine is bigger than yours" projects of hubris built at ridiculous cost. Dubai pretty much went bankrupt trying to build the Burj Khalifa, which now is named after the Emir of Abu Dhabi who financed the rest of the construction. Super skyscrapers don't make any economic sense and that is probably going to be the biggest limitation in building a city of them. Unless there is really no space left to build, you could house many times more people if the buildings are of a more normal height. Check out the diagram of the Burj Khalifa here to see just how small the upper half of the building is. Your interconnected walkways would have to be quite long (and stretchy, to deal with the buildings' sway in the wind). Here's one complication already happening: The ground may sink under the foundations Frankly, the rectangular mile high blocks built closely together you see in sci-fi movies need serious handwaving or sci-fi technology. Edit: some numbers. To guess a number, let's take Shanghai Tower which has its roof at 561 meters, only about 30m lower than Burj Khalifa, which has 244m of uninhabited spire. It als has 20% more floor space, a broader top and is in the middle of a high-rise district, so overall a better fit for a vertical city. Now we can start guessing some improved potential: 

Clothing makes your humans sick and/or unattractive This a purely biological scenario, something they couldn't change even if they wanted to. Your version of humans have vital biochemical processes going on in their skin which need (sun)light. Think somewhere between real-life vitamin D and Superman's solar powered-ness. Spending a few hours a day outside in the nude makes them strong, healthy, shiny heroes that are always warm and heal from scratches and wounds very quickly. Covering their skin too much or for too long makes them weak and sickly. A warrior might put on some armor pieces when preparing for battle and a princess might wear expensive translucent veils, but as soon as the covering is not needed, they take it off. A second way clothing may interfere is that your humans naturally secrete pheromones (like humans) but ones that decay rapidly. Any clothing will start to reek within an hour, making it unpleasant to be around that person. If someone wears the same clothes for a day, they smell like a corpse to their neighbors. When faced with the choice of washing 12+ changes of clothes per day or going nude, your people made the obvious one, or rather, never adopted clothing.
