I found a few appearance of the same symbol in heraldics, these are from English coat of arms and Canadian. I see no relation to Hungary, I would assume if a symbol is used on the very middle of the note should have some important meaning. 

I read about Guinea itself, how it was made, but I don't really understand why would anybody keep a money worth 5% more than an existing denomination like Pound. I can accept the 1/20 and 1/12 concept even though it is not as comfortable as the decimal system, but 21/20, furthermore because of the gold content the value of the coin wasn't fixed in all time, but in 1680's it's worth moved away from Pound, and it was replaced by Sovereign in the recoinage of 1816. I don't really understand the reasons why the empire kept it for over a century? Personally for me it looks messy without a central concept how a monetary system should be regulated within the empire. Maybe there are good reasons keeping it, but I don't see them. UPDATE To make my point more clear: I see a similar pattern in Hungary, when we introduced a .500 fine silver coin in 1993-1994 after collapsion of socialism into circulation with 200 HUF face value, shortly because of silver content it became more valuable, so people just collected them and kept it as more inflation proof money, it actually revoked itself from circulation and it was officially revoked by the government too. This was a clear failure of issue a different based money, and both people and government corrected the mistake naturally, why didn't this happen in British Empire for over 100 years? I can say the value distortion was smaller between Silver and Gold price than Silver and fiat money. But this system in the British empire seems deliberately kept up for some reason. 

It is fun to read the others, here is the link to the page. I can see Costa Rica is legally still at war in the first world war with Germany because of legal issues of Costa Rica's government back in time. Second example is Italy vs Japan. In the last days of second world war, the allies' occupied Italy declared war on Japan, but never signed peace between them. Are there more? To be precise after two answers: I am looking for examples where the peace was signed, but for some reason somebody didn't participated or it isn't valid. 

I would say, this kind of comparasion requires tons of time to research for each eras. If I have to take a method, I would choose a cost efficient version. It would be the first method since history of Gold usage for money. Take the comparasion between a fixed Gold standard USD from the very beginning of the 20th century (let's say 1900) and then compare that USD to modern USD inflation adjusted. For silver, be careful, since the gold-silver ratio was fixed for long time, but was released in the middle of the 19th century. 

First of all, tt was the age's fashion. But the main purpose was to cover the unhygienic hair. The general hygiene was really on a low level in Europe from the beginning of the dark ages until the end of the 19th century when people started to realize that most of the diseases can be prevented by simple methods like taking bath, washing hands, and by keeping clean the living space. You can read related sources on wikipedia of Hygenie and also I would recommend the sources on an another wikipedia link where they describe the 18th century wigs, and in the 16th and 17th centuries section they explain the health issues of the hair in these ages which is valid for 18th century as well. 

So James Cook was one of the first captains who realized (without knowing the precise effect) of having consumable vegetables on his ship the health issues were way less serious on the long trips. 

source So until Augustus the coin was relatively valuable, but in like 200 years it's value decreased significantly, which means roughly 2000% devaluation altogether. 

If we take these measurements to account, you can get a certain precision comparasion, but never very accurate. If I would need to make an estimate, I would take some sort of an average of the following: 

Altogether with increased precision of artillery and bombing the dynamic fronts got favoured, and I would point out that France tried to reproduce the WW1 situation and prepare with heavily fortified trenches and defense line namely Maginot line, we all know what happened to it in the WW2. The Germans had two plans to go around and use Blitzkrieg tactics to break through the less defended territories. The answer to the question: Tanks were very important factor to abandon the trench warfare, but there were more factors, they all sum up. 

The question seems lame for first sight, but makes sense in depth. The alliance systems weren't trivial at the start of World War 1 (or Great War). First I recommend to check out the timeline and look for the first dozens of lines of politics in gray. The outbreak of war wasn't one instance, it was a domino effect of triggers in alliances, warnings, mobilizations, guarantees for independeces etc. From Aplhahistory I would quote the following treaties which all had minor or major role in the participation of joining to the Great War: 

It looks you have an Electro Plated Nickel Silver. The technology is not old enough to origin from 18th century. From a site where you can find identical font type: 

Sanctions generally work when the country which suffers is isolated relatively and rely on trade with the opposite members of the sanctions. When Warsaw Pact existed it formed a separate and relatively independent economic structure from the west. It was named Comecon. As you said correctly: "All these sanctions are having crippling effects." This is an essential part of a sanction. If the country or countries don't suffer from the sanction. Of course we all know Comecon as a centrally organized trade agreement was way less efficient than western free trade, but if there were any sanctions against Warsaw Pact members, it would never be efficient at all. However de-facto there were sanctions between the two blocks, they generally avoided the trade with each other and COCOM list defined a series of high tech equipment which can't be sold to Warsaw Pact members. These actions were not very effective since both of the blocks were capable to maintain at least a basic living standard from their own resources until USSR overspent their money on military race and had serious structural problems. Also interesting fact is that computers generally weren't sold into USSR and allies, but they managed to make replicas like Hungarian Videoton computers. 

I found the Code of Ur-Nammu as code of laws, where in the prologue the code defines to source of power of the king, which is derived to deities. This seems the oldest surviving code of laws issued by a king. 

Summary: Actually Kirov was a rival of Stalin, with his death by murder (1st December 1934) the real terror in political level started. It was a good opportunity to Stalin to use it as excuse for bigger purge since Kirov was very (if not the most) popular party leader, so many people were outrageous about the event. Also Kirov was a party leader who had huge influence, with his disappearance Stalin's control over USSR greatly increased. On the other end, 1939 wasn't the end of purges, for example Trotsky was murdered in August of 1940 in Mexico, but the intensity of purge decreased a lot under the war. 

In Hungary they introduce new notes of 10000 HUF which contains a symbol I couldn't relate to Hungary's history, there were no official note known to me why do they use Patonce Cross on Hungarian note. 

I agree with Alex, I would add up a big point, I wanted to comment it, but it became bigger. Appearance of mass parachute also made trech warfare useless. In the time when the enemy could cross only through the sea and trenches they didn't expect double front battle from trenches, but when it was possible to parachute troops beyond the trenches there were two effects: 

I was reading the Wikipedia on passports, and there were numerous important dates in passport history, but I didn't find any date when passports became widely used documents for travelling. I see passports from late 19th century, and general passports were regulated by League of Nations in 1920s. Based on this my guess is that in 1920 the passports were used by almost all countries of the world. My question is: (approximately) when passports and border checks became widespread and commonly used procedures? UPDATE: adding more precision: when became passports (or its predecessor) as a travel document standard way to check travellers around the world? 

source As the chart shows, the Denarius finally lost most of it's value between 200-320 AD. Note: the two sources are a little bit contradicting in dates, however whichever is true, the question still valid. I listened a podcast from Stefan Molyneux (historian-philosopher) who blamed the debasing of currency as a main factor in fall of Rome. Is it accurate statement? Was it a symptom or cause? 

Let's assume Invader decides to ignore forts and let's just capture the capital city (main goal). On week 1 they make wonderful progress, passing by fort 1, 2, 3, 4. The catches are: 

There were many ways how these successions worked in different countries. To summarize the well written source in Wikipedia, giving the key words: One was Primogeniture Where all goes to the firstborn, this was usually working with male successors, but for example in Basque culture they always preferred the firstborn without gender preference. Semi-Salic agnatic-cognatic hereby means if all the male successors died, in succession women came in the similar order to men. Some form of Primogeniture was widespread in Western-European kingdoms. Secondly there is Agnatic Seniority A principle where the oldest patrilinear successor takes the titles. This method used by for example Kievian Rus, Kingdom of Poland, and in the present day by the Saud house. For the third there Elective Monarchies The monarch's person was elected by and from the rightful electors. Best example was the Holy Roman Empire. Ultimately what you are curious of mostly the Gavelkind In some regulations there was a compulsory share of the titles between the successors. So the most important titles left for the first successor, and the rest was divided between the immediate successors. Of course not all of them since the succession list could be huge with bigger families. Adding few comments: there were various local uses of these principles, other - less spread - methods, and the succession often meant of the main title (Grand Duchies, Kingdoms, Empires), often occured that brothers received lesser titles by grants to cool them down, especially if the successor was young and healthy since in that case their succession would be hopelessly far in time. 

By heraldics the shields for one figure designed to face to the enemy. So the figure was facing leftwards, and generally the shield was worn on the left hand. Try to imagine the concept, the shield's face facing out on the left hand, and the figure looks towards left, so towards the enemy. The case is different with more figures, that is more complex, but a single figure gives a good hint on the usage. I have a good book on this subject, but the wikipedia article also good enough. So traditionally it was worn on the left hand. The arguement of "stronger hand" falls if you consider in a battle you need to kill or incapable the enemy, so it is more essential to use the weapon with the hand which is stronger and more precise. Left handed people are more problematic in this subject, I have no sources yet to decide if they worn their shield on the right hand, and the weapon on the left hand. I can either imagine that they were forced to learn the righthanded fighting or they were left alone as exceptions of the rule. 

The main reasons are Cost-Efficiency points. Just consider how expensive is a full covering and well made helmet, and how much they are blocking the view. However this kind of helmet is blocking way less vision, I would say, judging by the position of eyes, not much of the vision will be disturbed. Just close one of your eyes and you can see your nose, switch, you see it from a different angle. If you open both, your nose will not disturb the vision. This works the same, if the eyes have common territory to see, the brain will sum up the sight. If you want to simulate the effect this part has, put a not too huge mobile phone on position to see how does it look like. Most probably you won't see what is going on in 30-40 centimeters on the front of your face in a line, but you will see what is happening in few meters, and that is the point. This minor improvement is blocking sword blows from each sides, can stop smaller maces. Instead of causing some serious damage on the face, it has some good chance to get bounced off from the head, and by a good chance if you get this kind of hit, by the force of the blow your head flips backwards, so the weapon is more probably will slip off upwards rather than going straight to your neck. Note that these helmets were worn by cheaper troops, and since they weren't as important as nobles, it didn't need to provide full defense, but some decent one for low cost. What it didn't provide is defense against piercing type of weapons. Spears, arrows, etc... only if those weapons hit the metal parts. If you consider a battle it is not indifferent if you can make a helmet for +10% money to save let's say 30%-40% more blows.
