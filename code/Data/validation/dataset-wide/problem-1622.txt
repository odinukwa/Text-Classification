Methanol in alcoholic beverages may cause hangover. Alcohol Hangover: Mechanism and Mediators "Possible contributing factors to hangover: compounds other than alcohol in beverages, especially methanol." NOTE: This is their opinion, not a study result. Alcoholic beverages high in congeners--byproducts of alcohol fermentation--(whisky, rum, red wine)--seem to cause hangover more often than those with less congeners: 

Topical use of fluoride (including fluoridated toothpaste) reduces the risk of dental caries in children and adults It is swallowed fluoride, which enters circulation and ends in teeth (until 8 years of age) and can cause dental mottling and not fluoride in the toothpaste - except when children swallow large amount of toothpaste. Small children can swallow 0.3 mg fluoride per brushing , which is about 1 mg per day. According to the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IMO), adequate intake (which reduces caries risk and does not cause tooth mottling) for fluoride for children 1-3 years old is 0.7 mg/liter and for 4-8 years olds 1 mg/liter (see reference above). In the U.S., fluoridated water contains 0.7-1.2 mg fluoride/liter. In areas with 1 mg fluoride/liter tap water, about 10% fluorosis in population was observed, and in areas with 2 mg fluoride/liter, 5% of moderate fluorosis was observed. $URL$ Tooth brushing after acidic meals is more harmful than brushing before acidic meals. 

Whisky vs. vodka: a review In this 2010 review of studies, authors agree that "...highest congener beverage (bourbon) results in more severe hangover ratings than does the beverage with essentially no congeners (vodka), although ethanol effects per se had a considerably stronger effect on hangover than did congener content." Alcohol type and hangover severity Reported hangover severity (in decreasing order) after drinking of various beverages: brandy, red wine, rum, whisky, white wine, gin, vodka, beer, ethanol diluted in orange juice. According to the article, hangover severity is related to amount of congeners. My conclusion: Hangover may be caused by ethanol and by congeners, but, from studies available, there is insufficient evidence that alcohol beverage quality ("well made", price) would be related to hangover.

The Facebook video is wrong because they have confused tequila with agave and probiotics with prebiotics. 1) Tequila is made of agave, (Alcoholreviews.com), which contains fructans, which are a type of fiber, which can act as a prEbiotic - a substance that can promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the human intestine (Agave.or.kr). Tequila is a distilled beverage, which does not contain fiber or any other carbohydrate (CalorieKing). Prebiotics are carbohydrates (WebMD), so if tequila does not contain carbohydrates, it does not contain prebiotics. 2) To me, it is apparent that in the video they wanted to mention prEbiotics, but they erroneously used the term prObiotics, which is a much more known word. Probiotics are live bacteria or yeasts that may have beneficial effects in the human intestine (WebMD). Strong alcoholic beverages, such as 80 proof tequila do not contain live bacteria or yeasts, at least not in sufficient amounts that would make them probiotics. In conclusion: Tequila contains neither probiotics nor prebiotics. 

Question: "Does the evidence support a strong causal relationship between (specifically) fructose consumption and obesity?" My answer: NO. Consideration 1: This question has arisen because of "simultaneous" increase of use of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and obesity in the United States. Consideration 2: There has been some debate if fructose increases appetite. According to American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008) it may not: 

"Alkaline" diet is a wrongly used term, it should be "alkalizing." Alkalizing diet is the diet that alkalizes the urine — it raises the pH of the urine. Most fruits and vegetables alkalize the urine (even when most fruits are slightly acidic, but note, not acidifying), and most meats and fats are acidifying, probably because of high amino acid and fatty acid content...Acidic urine promotes the growth of calcium-oxalate stones (by far the most common, about 80% of all stones), urate and cystine stones. Alkaline urine promotes the growth of calcium-phosphate stones. NOTE: Calcium-oxalate and calcium-phosphate stones are not the same, so it is not enough to say "calcium" stones...Alkalizing diet can (or may) help prevent stones that grow in acidic urine (calcium-oxalate, urate, cystine), but it can promote the growth of calcium-phosphate stones. PubMed Central It is probably potassium in fruits that makes them alkalizing. Here is a list of foods high in potassium (Nutrientsreview.com) In several studies (see the Linus Pauling Institute link below) high potassium diet was associated with the lower risk of calcium-oxalate kidney stones, but "associated" does not already mean the cause-effect relationship. Also, it is often hard to say, was it potassium, alkalization or some other property of food that prevented kidney stones. Conclusions: 

Broccoli is not really an appropriate food to be advertised as high in protein; one serving (1/2 cup, cooked, 78 g) contains only 2 g of protein. (NutritionData) 

Question: Does red meat increase the risk of heart disease? My answer: Consumption of red meat was associated with increased risk of heart disease in some, but not all, studies, which suggests that some common red meat ingredient, like sodium or other preservatives, rather than red meat by itself may be the actual risk factor. $URL$ A prospective study in Swedish men, 2014 

My conclusion: High-fiber diet may help prevent constipation and thus hemorrhoids, but in some people with irritable bowel syndrome, insoluble fiber can worsen constipation and thus potentially worsen hemorrhoids symptoms. Dietary fiber can have a stool-softening effect only when consumed with sufficient amount of water. 

Phytates can inhibit (partially prevent) the absorption of non-heme iron from plant foods (but not from meat) by 50% (Linus Pauling Institute), so this question applies more to vegetarians than omnivores. From the studies below, I conclude that phytates as a single factor do not likely cause mineral deficiencies, but may contribute to them in individuals on poorly designed vegan diets or those with small intestinal malabsorption disorders. 1.

In several studies, chocolate consumption was associated with decreased risk of heart disease. Association does not already mean the cause-effect relationship, though. The supposedly beneficial nutrients in chocolate are flavonoids, which are found in higher amounts in dark than in milk chocolate. 

My conclusion: When the effects of dark chocolate in some studies seem to be small and of questionable clinical significance (a relatively small drop--2.8 mm Hg--of blood pressure) and inconsistent (no benefits in some studies), for me, there is insufficient evidence about the beneficial effects of dark chocolate on heart disease. 

My claims: a) Short-term exercise, including marathon running (~4 hours), does not result in low blood potassium levels and therefore does not likely cause muscle cramps. NAP.edu b) Long-term exercise (hard physical work, several days in a hot environment) can result in mildly lowered blood potassium levels but probably not severe enough to cause cramps. NAP.edu c) Hyponatremia can cause cramps, but fitness-level exercise does not likely cause hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is rare even in marathon runners, and is not caused solely by sodium loss through sweat, but by a combination of sodium loss and excessive water drinking. PubMed Central Some facts: - Mildly lowered blood potassium levels usually do not cause any symptoms, but moderately lowered levels can cause cramps. You can lose about 500 mg of potassium per liter of sweat, but this is not enough to cause hypokalemia. Potassium that moves from blood to sweat is quickly replaced by potassium that moves from cells to blood. Nutrientsreview Someone who has moderate hypokalemia can get cramps without any exercise, even during sleep. The exact mechanism of exercise-related cramps is still not known. Lactic acid buildup and muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) are two possible causes. Hyponatremia is very unlikely to develop in exercise lasting less than 2 hours and it occurs only in combination with excessive water drinking. Conclusion: to have potassium-related muscle cramps, you would need to have potassium deficiency, which can develops within weeks, not within few hours of exercise.

Here is one 2004 study about antioxidants intake in Norwegian adults, because I believe the question is more about coffee than the United States, right?: "The intake of coffee contributed approximately 11.1 mmol, followed by fruits (1.8 mmol), tea (1.4 mmol), wine (0.8 mmol), cereals (i.e., all grain containing foods; 0.8 mmol), and vegetables (0.4 mmol)...Surprisingly, the single greatest contributor to the total antioxidant intake was coffee." Source: PubMed Here is a search result for "antioxidants" in Cochrane Summaries. Conclusions of all 30 or so studies related to antioxidants are that there is insufficient evidence about their effectiveness. 

Haribo sugarless gummy bears contain Hydrogenated Glucose Syrup (HGS) (brand name LYCASIN). Source: Haribo.com HGS, which is a sugar alcohol or polyol, can cause "loss of appetite, occasional diarrhoea, cramps, and a "bloated feeling". Source: Inchem.org Not only HGS, but most other polyols used in "no-sugar" foods, mainly candies and gums, such as hydrogenated starch hydrolysates (HSH), isomalt, lactitol, maltitol, sorbitol and xylitol, but not erythritol, can cause abdominal bloating, excessive gas or diarrhea if consumed in excess. This happens because polyols are not digested in the human small intestine, so they pass to the large intestine where "beneficial" (normal) intestinal bacteria break them down into gases and other substances that can cause bloating and diarrhea. Source: Nutrientsreview.com This is a known issue and producers typically place warnings about side effects on the packages; not sure if Haribo does, though.

Question: Can food type have any effect on weight loss even though net calories would remain constant? Answer: Yes. When you start a low-carb diet (for example < 50 g carbs/day), within the first 1-2 days, your body glycogen stores (about 500 grams) are depleted. Every gram of glycogen is bound to about 4 grams of water, so along with glycogen depletion, about 2 liters (2 kg) of water will be released and excreted with urine (source: Wiley Online Library). This way, you can lose 2.5 kg of body weight in the first 1-2 days of a low-carb diet, but this is not a fat weigh loss but glycogen and water weigh loss. This is just the initial effect, which does not continue with continuing a low-carb diet. A diet with the same calories/day and enough carbohydrates (>100 g/day) does not cause glycogen depletion and therefore does not result in water loss and weight loss in the first days in the way as low-carb diet does. I'm not aware of any study that would confirm that a diet with a certain composition would result in greater fat weight loss than other isocaloric diets.

4. Calories listed in the US Department of Agriculture nutrition database (and therefore on the Nutrition Facts labels of foods) "represent physiologically available energy, which is the energy value remaining after digestive and urinary losses are deducted from gross energy." (USDA.gov, page 14) This is "metabolic energy," which, if in excess of your body needs, can be used for the production of heat or is converted to fat stores (weight gain). If you eliminate the part of energy used for heat, you get "net metabolic energy (NME)," which, if in excess of body needs, results in weight gain. So, to compare the effect of different nutrients on weight gain, you need to use NME. All this is explained in this 2007 article in European Journal of Clinical Nutrition. According to the table from the same journal (EJCN), fructose has one of the lowest net metabolizable energies among sugars and other digestible carbohydrates, so this again does not support the view that fructose causes more weight gain than other sugars: 

There were many reports how people survived without water from 7 to 10 days and they didn't mention any urine drinking. A healthy, sedentary young adult in a moderate climate loses at least about 1 liter of water per day — obligatory water loss by urination, breathing and invisible perspiration, but no sweating; you lose about 500 mL of water with the urine. You die when you lose 10-15% of your initial body weight due to water loss; for a 70 kg person, this is 7-10.5 kg body mass (7-10.5 liters of water). So, the question is can you replace some of this water by drinking urine. Yes, you can, but more water (urine) you drink, the more urine you will excrete, so the expected water replacement doesn't actually work. On the first day without water, when you are still relatively well hydrated you excrete about 500 mL urine, but by consuming this you also consume some urea and sodium — these will eventually need to be excreted again and some water will be needed for that, so the net benefit of drinking 500 mL of urine will be....less than 500 mL... With progression of dehydration, you will excrete smaller amounts of urine, which will be highly concentrated. If you drink this concentrated urine, you will obligatory excrete (urinate) more water (to excrete ingested urea and sodium) than you drank it — so in this stage, by drinking urine you are actually dehydrating yourself. The water from the urine you drank in the first few days will be excreted in those first days and you will be pretty much out of urine probably after the day 5. This means you can not prolong your survival time with drinking urine (assuming you can survive without any water (or urine) for 7-10 days anyway).
