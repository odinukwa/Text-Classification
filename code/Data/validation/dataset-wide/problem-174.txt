Increased global temperatures won't cause the land to all be desert. The warmer it is, the more water evaporates and then falls as rain, so average global rainfall will increase rather than decreasing. Wind patterns will change and the rain may well fall in different places from where it falls now, so there will be some new deserts, but existing deserts may well get rain. Think of your new default biome as being tropical rain forest, not desert. 

This seems to me the more difficult part. Negligibly senescent humans are a dream of distant future. However, you might want to read up on the wikipedia article about research strategies to neglect age-related damage to human tissue. From the article, you see that DNA mutations, junk protein, cell loss, loss of cell division capability and changes in cell linking protein all contribute to ageing in humans. Cancer and degenerative diseases are common consequences. Summary: In my opinion, the human anatomy is already quite close to that of Thor and the way to get there is theoretically known. However, to reach the desired age, several profound advances in different fields of medicine and biotechnology that are currently far from reality, have to be achieved. 

Write a book about your story Get a gold bar authenticated as real gold Become a paid speaker at conferences or book signings or whatever, using your gold bar as a prop to bolster credibility. You could even give moral lectures about the evils of greed and how you won't sell the gold because money isn't important (you just insist on a $100,000 speakers fee because, you know, expenses) Eventually, you might actually sell one as a collector's item, but your main money could come from the book/speaking circuit. 

Yes, with no caveats. The stars in a binary star system can be extremely far apart, and if they are sufficiently far apart then an Earth-like planet in orbit around one of them will not be disturbed by the presence of the other. To pick a nearby example, if Alpha Centauri B did not exist then a planet around Alpha Centauri A would not be bothered by Proxima Centauri aka Alpha Centauri C, 13,000 AU away (about a fifth of a light year). It would just be a faint (magnitude 5) red star with a very fast proper motion. 

Regarding your question about animals lower down the food-chain developing intelligence, I want to present you Alex. Although Grey Parrots sometimes eat insects, they are generally frugivorous - eating fruits, seeds and the like. Still they show remarkably intelligence, matching the level of apes in cognitive tests. The following reasons are brought forward to explain their intelligence: 

seems not too unlikely. If you compare an average human to a top athlete like Ashton Eaton, the differences are striking. Hence, I would argue that most of what is needed to become "harder, better, faster, stronger" is already embedded in the human genetic code. How do you get all humans to become more like that? Well, only those people mostly resembling Thors anatomy are allowed to reproduce: Forced selection of partners based on individual genetics will help to evolve super humans over time. 

The short answer is no. The accuracy required by LIGO, able to detect a difference of one thousandth the size of a proton over a distance of four kilometres, is beyond the capacity of an evolved biological system, since there's no intermediate stage that would be partially useful like there is with eyes and such-like. 

Since skin colour affects appearance, sexual selection comes into play. Whatever skin colour their culture finds most attractive is what will be selected for. 

It isn't really something you could do, but you could always say the end is near every single day until you're right, then take credit for it! 

For something man made, climate change is probably the way to go. Biological weapons just might too, a resistant thing that spreads and mutates before anyone knows what hit them, then the rest die off from like starvation and such in the aftermath. There'd probably be a few survivors though. I'm not sure man made (aside again from perhaps climate change - BTW I would lump asteroid strikes in the same category, as it is the climate change rather than the strike itself that brings on the most pain), but god made things can. Start praying! For something god made, I'm in favor of a number of solar events: 

Trivially, you can't. Just imagine a two-dimensional labyrinth, except that the exit goes into the third dimension from one of the "islands" that you can't get to by keeping your hand on a wall. 

Tidal lock is irrelevant. All you're asking is if a planet can have a heavier surface gravity than a larger planet, to which the answer is a definite yes. Just for example, Uranus is much larger than the Earth, but its "surface" (cloud-top) gravity is only 89% of the Earth's, because it's much less dense. 

This list is based on this paper: Cognitive ornithology: the evolution of avian intelligence and can be used to explain the development of animal intelligence in general. 

It is not very convenient to include several different ways to produce chemical energy into one organism. On the cellular level, this will entail different metabolic pathways, that may even intervene each other. Better to focus on one method and streamline that one. Furthermore, your algae (almost) already exists: Brown algae have the fastest linear growth of any organism on this plant. The record holder is M. pyrifera. Unfortunately they are restricted to shallow waters as they need to attach to bottom substrate. However, there are Sargassum species, which have a complete free-floating (=pelagic) life cycle: for example S. natans. The goal for your scientist is now to alter the Sargassum species to inherit the insane growth rates of M. pyrifera! And just like that you have a super-growing algae that you can grow without further restrictions in any water tank. These species reproduce only by fragmentation, so no need to be scared about spore contamination. Even without genetically growth enhancement the Sargassum algae today produces crazy amounts of biomass, look at this article: $URL$ PS: If you don't want to grow them in tanks, why not manufacture a huge ocean gyre that traps your enhanced Sargassum in one place, building a huge natural Sargassum farm? Oh wait... 

No, it's not plausible for binary planets to be inside each other's Roche limit, no matter how hard the substance they're made of. Anything on the surface of one planet would be lifted off the surface by the tidal force when the other planet was overhead -- that's what being inside the Roche limit means. 

All you need is three ground stations, about 120 degrees of longitude apart. We're greatly assisted by the Moon being tidally locked, so assuming the base is on the near side it will never be out of line-of-sight with the Earth. NASA already do this for their Deep Space Network, in the US, Spain and Australia. 

Have bazillions of space habitats in a single solar system (whether our own in the future, or some other one) and let the diversity of humanity just explode. Our own solar system could support trillions of people - or thousands of times more than that! There'd be so many people who all do so many things that nobody could keep up with the news... strange, new worlds can be isolated just by huge volume - and thus explored by someone not that far away by distance, but really far away by culture, etc. Traveling a million miles could pass a trillion people. Months journey (or weeks or days, just say there's more or less infrastructure to get the travel time you want) and thousands of Earths. And don't forget how big and diverse our one Earth is!
