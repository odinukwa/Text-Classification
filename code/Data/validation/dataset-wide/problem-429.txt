Nearly impossible, but depends upon the techniques used (the complexity of the algorithms, and which algorithms were employed). The fields of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) both developed from the original field of AI, which at inception encompassed efforts to produce agents which could perform human and human-like tasks. One major area of study was how to make algorithms more efficient, such as algorithms to peform search (A* and min-max, for example), and some have described AI as a search and optimization problem. Call this branch of AI the search/optimization branch. The goal of this branch is both to perform human tasks, and perform them optimally. The related field of Machine Learning (ML) heavily leans upon statistics, and an ML-agent learns from many examples, deducing underlying patterns. ML is used for classification and prediction, and is used for many AI applications. Techniques used in ML include Decision Trees (DT), Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Neural Networks (NN), Bayesian Inference, Reinforcement Learning (reward based feedback). The optimal/search AI techniques include search (A*, min-max, simulated annealing, etc). But there is another branch of AI which focuses upon behaving and thinking more like a human, where the optimal solution is not the goal, but more human behavior. The techniques used by that branch rely less upon large numbers of training examples, and more about reasoning from few examples, more inductive and adductive, than deductive. Techniques used by this branch of AI include Version Spaces, Case Based Reasoning, and many others. The meta-reasoning methods used in AI can employ several different approaches, and then use meta-AI to choose the 'best' solution from competing solutions. Anyway, there are many tools and techniques wielded by an AI-writer. Some are much more understandable to a person examining the behavior than other approaches. Consider Decision Trees, Version Spaces, and rules-based engines. These techniques are approachable and the reasoning taken to induce a model can be understood. Compare that with Neural Networks (NN), where a convolutional NN (deep learning) can 'learn' concepts in what appear to be mysterious ways. The brief answer to your question is which techniques were used to construct the AI-agent? A reasonably complex AI-agent that includes many models and employs meta-reasoning would both be more likely to approach an Artificial General Intelligence, and be very complex, reaching decisions through reasoning which could prove impossible to understand. The complexity of the programming would be one factor, but the models constructed from the training examples could require huge amounts of space. Finding which model data decide for suffering would be akin to finding a needle in a haystack the size of Jupiter. 

Depends on how the resulting inflation is spread through the economy. In most general terms: it would affect those who save money, and those who borrow money. Theoretically, it will not affect wage earners (because if inflation is spread perfectly evenly through the economy, wages should go up at the same rate as all other prices). Of course, in the real world, inflation won't spread evenly. If history is any guide, wages won't actually participate in the inflation. The impact on savers and borrowers is complicated. Those who saved at fixed interest rates before starting this form of taxation will lose the most. Those who borrowed at fixed interest rates before starting this form of taxation will benefit the most. Those who save or borrow after this scheme starts will see the interest rate spread increase corresponding to the amount of money being printed. Investors in assets will (again, theoretically - asssuming a perfectly even spread of inflation) neither lose nor benefit, because whatever assets they invested in will rise in value along with inflation. Investors in derivatives (futures, options etc.) or any time-based assets will need to carefully do the math. 

It depends on how carefully controlled this approach is. If you can trust politicians not to do this to excess, then the effects may be manageable. However, there will always be some negative effect on faith in the currency system, because everybody who uses the currency will know in advance that it will lose value over time. 

First off, the question is somewhat meaningless. A society where such a lack of privacy is possible will not devolve into a zero-privacy society, but rather into a society where privacy becomes a luxury good. This also means that privacy would become asymmetric: ordinary people wouldn't have privacy, but elites would keep it (as would governments). In this scenario, trust would not be enhanced, but undermined. This happens because ordinary people have no reason to trust elites (who would still have privacy), and elites would fear that ordinary people might still eke out enough privacy to stage an uprising. By the way, this type of society is by no means utopian. That is one reason I arrived at the privacy-as-a-luxury-good. Privacy is a very recent invention to begin with. Privacy only started taking hold when people were able to build large enough houses or apartments to have rooms to retreat to. In many parts of the world, privacy has effectively been outlawed. The most obvious example is North Korea, but also in the Pilgrim's New England, there were laws that prohibited anybody from living alone; for singles, widowers or widows, etc., having roommates were mandatory "to prevent sin". Today's NSA/GCHQ is actually somewhat similar: they expect complete privacy for themselves (under threat of life in prison or even a death penalty), yet insist that nobody else be allowed to have privacy (even to the point where Britain's Cameron suggested outlawing encryption). The hypothetical society in the original question would suffer the same fate. Possessing these types of drones, or the 3-d printers that produce them, would likely be unavailable to ordinary people. They would likely be illegal, and since there is no privacy, it would also be impossible for ordinary people to illegally own them. So, no, a true zero-privacy society for everybody is not going to happen. Privacy-as-a-luxury-good would be the real outcome. 

There must be something pretty special that exists only inside this asteroid. Select an asteroid of sufficient size to burrow into the middle, but not so large as to make mining exploration appealing. Build a mini-capsule inside that spins independently of the asteroid. There's your full gravity, independent of the asteroid's rotation. With a sufficiently large crust, any heat from the flubberconverter coils could be absorbed and diffused into the asteroid itself without raising ambient temperatures to externally interesting levels. Avoid localized heat build up by drilling a network of negative space from the inside and build a massive distributed heat-sink. If it's a big enough asteroid, inside the capsule/mini-ship he can create a self-balancing ecosystem for himself, given enough self-discipline not to overtax its boundaries. For example, he can live there comfortably without overeating his oxygen-producing crops, but a visitor would destroy the balance and doom the life-support within days. Or he can only pirate the galactic news feed for an hour a day without stealing power from his plant's lighting, etc. Maybe his imported sea-bass get very ill-tempered if he doesn't eat enough of them, which may be likely if he gets tired of writing his cookbook, '101 Ingenious Ways to Eat the Same Thing for the Rest of Your Life'. The major detection problems would be in going and coming, unless it was in a dangerous part of space (what isn't?) where it would be more conceivable for ships to drop off of long range scanners without notice. Even inconvenient portions of the galaxy will have occasional visitors. Perhaps he will turn on the lights, and never leave again - that has its own ramifications. As others have stated, the best camouflage is to look as natural and normal and boring as possible. There may be an opportunity here to line the inner portion of the asteroid with heavier metals to give the illusion of a solid mass to casual scans, much in the same way that lead is sometimes used to fake a "solid" gold bar. 

Yes, but with a caveat. Printing money is effectively the same as taxation, but with far less control and supervision. First of all, "the government" always "prints money". Actually, in most countries, it's not the government, but some central bank that is usually semi-independent, such as the Federal Reserve in the USA, the ECB in Europe, or the Bank of England in Britain. and the money is not created through physical printing bills, but through loan transactions. This "printing money" should be balanced by money being destroyed (through loans being paid off, mostly), and economic growth. When more money is created beyond that balance, you get inflation (either systemic inflation throughout the economy, or sometimes investment bubbles such as the housing bubble of the early 21st century, or stock bubbles). Inflation simply means that each unit of currency (dollar or whatever) will be worth less. Now what you are proposing is basically that the extra money goes to finance the government, but those who already have money or income (i.e., the population) suffers the loss of value of money. In other words, the population pays for the government's operation. Which is no different from taxation, just through another means. Here are some of the problems - and benefits - of using "printing money" instead of taxes to finance the government: 

I don't think that it is fundamentally possible because any habitable planet will have geologic activity as well as climate actions. Earth as a planet will remain habitable for a very long time, but no individual spot can be guaranteed to remain habitable. Over 10 million years, you have to look at such things as an ice age steamrolling over your city regardless of how it is built. You have to look at continental plates crushing and in the process changing the shape of a formerly flat area into vertical mountain cliffs or even turning your city upside down. You have to look at the crust of the earth being stretched and possibly a new ocean forming where you built your "forever" city. Of course you can TRY to find the most geologically stable spot, but pretty much no matter where you go, over 10 million years, your town will suffer catastrophic events that even the rock itself can't withstand.
