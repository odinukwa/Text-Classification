There have been several papers published on this topic, which don't always agree. Check out Ten Do It Better, Do They? which concludes that "that the impact of a red card depends on the minute of the expulsion and does not have an impact at all if given at the end of the first half or later" though red cards do increase the number of goals scored. Estimating the Effect of the Red Card in Soccer says, 

In American football you have to have at least 7 players on the line of scrimmage. You can have more, but some of your players are then "covered" by others and are no longer eligible. What's the point of this rule? What if you allowed the offense to put a few people on the line of scrimmage as they liked? Or, if it's necessary to have five offensive linemen on the line of scrimmage for some reason, why force two receivers to be on the line as well? 

In which countries did broadcasting rights for the World Cup sell for the most? If possible, let's include all media (TV, streaming internet, radio) and all languages (so in the U.S. this would include Univision buying the Spanish-language rights). The thing that got me started thinking about this was the question of whether the rights are highly valuable in the U.S. Specifically, I was thinking: 

People often talk about penalty kicks in soccer/football as if they were a guessing game, where the keeper tries to guess to what part of goal the the penalty-taker is going to kick the ball before the ball is even struck. Economists have studied it as a game theory problem, like a slightly more complex version of rock/paper/scissors that plays out on a human scale. But of course there must be some skill in it. How frequently can a professional goalkeeper save penalties taken by, say, a typical teenager who plays on a varsity team at his high school (or whatever the non-American equivalent is)? What if we flip the roles around: how would a professional penalty-taker fare against a non-professional goalkeeper? 

A simple enough question, but I'm having trouble finding a clear answer. I'm interested to know why the shootout is used in the World Junior Championships. I'm assuming it's either because: The players are of a junior level or International hockey rules Does anyone know? EDIT: To add an additional level to the question. Assuming from the comment below that it's due to international rules, what is the reasoning behind the international rules? 

Over the last few years I've started to pay a bit more attention to Cricket, but I'm far removed from the culture and don't have much of an understanding of it. So the question is: If a person was an aspiring Cricket player in any given place in the world, which league or leagues would they dream of playing in, and which tournaments would they dream of winning? 

Exact statistics are hard to find, but given the nature of hockey it's definitely a winning strategy. One of the key ways to score a goal in hockey is to get shots on net. It doesn't matter if it's a particularly good shot. If a goalie's save percentage is .900, if you get thirty shots there are good odds you'll score 3 goals, whether they're flukey or artwork. And one of the more sure ways to get shots in hockey are either odd-man rushes where players have lanes to put the puck on net, or when they have a man advantage and a player can get into empty space. This is why the power-play, and being short-handed are often central to hockey strategy. If you can group 5 really good players on a powerplay against a team with weak special teams, your odds of scoring increase by a huge amount. This line of thinking also applies to pulling the goalie. When there are six attackers versus five defenders, the attacking team has far better odds of scoring a goal due to increased shooting lanes and an easier time retaining possession. When at even strength they might be lucky to get one quality scoring chance in 2-3 minutes, with an extra attacker they might get three or four, or even more. In other words, if they pull the goalie there are much better odds that they'll score a goal, if they don't pull the goalie there are much better odds that they won't score a goal. Since a goal is what they need, pulling their goalie is a good idea. 

Just another sport apart from the ones Philip Kendall mentioned, is cricket. While the outfield has to be of grass, the pitch can be of varied types. The condition of the pitch can vary from a green top to a completely dry,dusty surface. Like tennis, the different conditions of the pitches will suit different players/teams. The various types of pitches include: (non-exhaustive) 

The player can put in a transfer request. But the club is under no obligation to let him go. The player must either attempt to patch things up with the management or be resigned to sitting on the sidelines. In this situation, generally, a player good enough to be in the first team would like to have as much playing time as possible. A recent example would be Saido Berahino with West Bromwich Albion. He put in an official transfer request. But the club refused to let him go. They rejected all the transfer offers they recieved for Berahino. He plays for the club in the Barclays Premier League right now, but he is not a regular first team starter, generally coming on as a substitute. 

Apart from this, all umpires receive ₹750 as daily allowance, ₹600 as conveyance allowance, and free hotel accommodation. To see the salaries of umpires part of the ICC International Panel see this article. 

This rule is just for NBA and WNBA. NCAA and FIBA rules state the team must continue to play with 4 players. 

The starting lineup for each squad is selected by a fan ballot, while the reserves are chosen by a vote among the head coaches from each squad's respective conference. Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players. The head coach of the team with the best record in each conference is chosen to lead their respective conference in the All-Star Game, with a prohibition against repeat appearances. Fans vote on the starters for the game, selecting three frontcourt players and two guards from each conference. NBA coaches vote for the reserves for their respective conferences, none of which can be players on their own team. Each coach selects two guards, three frontcourt players and two wild cards, with each selected player ranked in order of preference within each category. If a multi-position player is to be selected, coaches are encouraged to vote for the player at the position that is "most advantageous for the All-Star team", regardless of where the player is listed on the All-Star ballot or the position he is listed in box scores. If a player is unavailable for the game due to injury, the NBA commissioner selects a replacement for the roster. If the replacement is for a fan-selected starter, the all-star coach chooses the replacement in the starting lineup, and is not limited to the commissioner's addition to the roster. It is possible for more than one All-Star to be selected from one team, but there has never been more than 4 All-Stars represent a team in the game. For the Slam Dunk contest, players nominate themselves as competitors. Usually it is up-and-coming youngsters who take part in the challenge, though there are no rules(that I am aware of) stopping more experienced players participating. For the 3-point contest as well, players nominate themselves. 

Down to Ten: Estimating the Effect of a Red Card in Soccer finds an effect even for cards in the second half. Being down to nine men is much rarer and probably has not been studied carefully, for lack of data if nothing else. You also ask, "Are there ever any scenarios when playing down a man can actually improve a team's odds of winning?" I don't know of any evidence of this, but "Ten Do It Better" does note that "an old football myth suggests that...an expulsion might also be beneficial since it increases the team spirit as well as the efforts of the affected team." 

I sometimes hear about NFL GMs being "cap experts" rather than player-evaluators. And I just saw this headline: "John Idzik joining Jags as consultant". The article goes on to say, "Idzik, who was fired by the Jets in late December, will not have a role in player evaluation but will work with the team's salary-cap department, the source said" (emphasis mine). Sure the salary cap rules aren't simple, but how do they justify an entire department? 

When watching soccer on TV I often hear the commentators say stuff like, "They've come out in a 3-5-2, not their usual 4-4-2 in the hopes of ..." or "they've got so-and-so acting as 'false 9' today." How could I recognize these strategies myself? 

I've heard the term "press high" repeatedly while watching the World Cup. What does it mean? Do teams that press high generally enjoy more possession or less? 

Soccer (or "football", if you prefer) generally does not get a large television audience in the United States. However, the World Cup may be an exception (it certainly is among the people I talk to). Plus, the U.S.'s has a large population and, more importantly, the world's highest GDP. Presumably the value of advertisements is roughly proportional to the population, holding other factors constant. Lastly, with the Cup being in Brazil this year the games are on at a reasonable time for most Americans. 

So if occam's razor says anything about it, they're likely done in the name of expediency: producing a winner quickly. I'd guess this is more prevalent in formats where teams are playing many games within a short span of time. If they're forced to play endless sudden death over time arounds, the players might be too fatiqued for more play on subsequent days. 

The logic behind the new system is that it means more teams are in the playoff race down the stretch, which increases attendance and fan engagement. In the old system you have one playoff boundary: 9th vs 8th in a conference. This means that the only playoff race in each conference is between teams that surround that boundary. The games that are played by teams who are safely in front of it or behind it down the stretch, end up being largely irrelevant. But in the new system you can either make the playoffs by winning your division, or by winning a wild card. If you're in a division whose record is well below a wild card spot, you can still make the playoffs via your division. OTOH, if you're well out of the playoffs in a strong division, you may be able to fight for a wild card. The sum effect is that more teams are in contention for a playoff spot at the end of the year, and the fans of lesser quality teams win by having more reason to care at that period of the season. Another side-effect, but with more of a neutral impact, is that team strategy has to change too. With divisional play being more important, teams need to focus their efforts on their own division. 

As @Don_Biglia mentioned, there's no way of knowing what a manager writes on his notepad. But some intelligent guesswork would suggest he/she is keeping a note of certain points about the game. It could be anything from a list of things to say at half time to individual advice to be given to certain players. Of course for all we know he/she could just be doodling as well, probably a technique to keep oneself calm. Many managers do not write anything, leaving that job to one of his/her assistants. Basically, it's up to the individual manager to do what he/she wants during a match, as long as he/she stays within the technical area and does not engage in any unsportsmanlike behaviour. 

Actually, the boundary is restored every time it has been displaced by a fielder (or any other agent). You never see it happening because the broadcasting companies never end up showing it. This is largely due to the fact that there is always something more interesting to show than the replacing of the boundary ropes. As you rightly mentioned, even a few centimetres seems to make quite a difference in cricket today, and hence the restoring of the boundary rope to its original position is very important. Next time you go to a stadium to watch a cricket match, observe the boundary rope after it has been displaced (for whatever reason). You will notice someone (ball boy/ substitute player/ stadium official) will restore the boundary rope to its original position. (NOTE: This might cause you to miss out on some cricketing action happening around the pitch).
