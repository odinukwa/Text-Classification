The coolest potential climates for tidally-locked planets are Eyeball planets (see here: $URL$ and here: $URL$ There are some climate models for Proxima b that find Eyeball solutions. If the planet is covered in water, it will be frozen on the permanent nightside but with a liquid pond on the part of the planet pointing to the star. 

If we had Venus' atmosphere Earth would be a "steamball" planet. Alternately, if Earth were covered in ice, which is very reflective, the surface temperature would plummet and we would be a snowball planet (this is actually thought to have happened at least twice in Earth's history). FYI Venus is currently in the "dry roasted" state. For more details, see $URL$ 

This is just one sort of peculiar form of the 1:1 orbital resonance. (For more see here, here or or here). From the comments I'm seeing a lot of confusion about what this type of orbit actually looks like. Here is a nice animation comparing different reference frames: $URL$ And here are a couple more animations I found. This one shows that Janus and Epimetheus don't really change orbital distance all that much: $URL$ The actual change is less than 1 part in 1000, so it would not have much of an effect on the climate. I suppose if you had a more extreme mass ratio between the two planets, then the smaller one could have larger excursion in orbital radius. And here is a really nice article on Janus and Epimetheus' orbits: $URL$ 

Given a planet without any relationship to Earth, what does it mean for the poles to be "north" or "south"? Is it something arbitrary that can be changed? 

Barring some form of setting specific contrivance, none. The goal in building an armoured fighting vehicle like a tank is to give it the best armour for its mass, to spread the weight out over the largest area you can so it has grip and won't sink into the ground, to give it the lowest profile you can so it is a difficult target and can hide behind terrain features, and in the particular case of tanks, to pack in the biggest gun you can manage so that you can beat the armour of enemy AFVs, and to provide stability for that weapon so you can fire it accurately, even when moving. A flat, low to the ground box with enormous treads and a single big gun mounted in a rotating turret in the middle does this very well. A giant humanoid is very hard to armour, It has a large surface area for its size and complex, multi-axis joints that are near impossible to armour effectively. This is also the major difficulty with human body armour. A tank is a compact box with a turret that has two single axis rotating joints making it fairly easy to armour. The treads are more difficult, but still easier than limbs, especially at the front. Bipeds also have very high ground pressure compared to a tank. Even if given snow-shoe-like feet, a biped is going to find a much larger range of terrain to be "soft" than a similarly massive tank is. Because of its low slung design and top mounted turret, a tank is able support a gun that is a significant proportion of its own mass. A mech the size of a tank would not be able to use a gun anywhere near the size of the tank's gun. A tank is always laying prone compared to a mech and still able to move at full speed. A giant humanoid is an easy target. It can drop prone, but only if it knows in advance that it is about to be attacked, and it will take much longer to do so that a human would (it takes time to fall a greater distance) and will take more damage from doing so (Square cube law plus longer fall.) Afterwards it will be unable to move effectively until it stands back up. The agility and familiarity of movement often suggested as benefits of mecha is also going to be hampered by the square-cube scaling issues. They just wouldn't be able to move like we can, any more than an elephant could move like a cheetah. Even with a full on neural interface that makes it feel as if the vehicle is your body, the limitations and change in scale would feel extraordinarily alien. It would be something like adapting to having osteoporosis, with ordinary ground feeling soft and slippery like mud, in low gravity. With fewer degrees of freedom to worry about, it would probably be much easier to adapt existing training with other ground vehicles to tanks than body sense to mecha. Without neural interfaces or something similar, there's absolutely no benefit to a humanoid shape, and a massive increase in complexity in terms of controls. Besides overestimating the agility a giant robot would have, many people underestimate the agility of tanks. Considering they weigh 40-50 tonnes or so, modern tanks are phenomenally manoeuvrable. They are also extremely stable while maneuvering, allowing them to attack effectively while on the move, and they are extremely resistant to being flipped. Some have suggested that height gives an advantage in seeing the enemy, but there are tanklike vehicles already have telescoping periscopes that they can deployed without having to expose the rest of the vehicle. This gives the benefits of height without the drawbacks of raising the entire vehicle. A tank is also just a lot simpler to build as it has fewer things that need to be moved around. It doesn't need a complex dynamic stability system just to keep it from falling over, and it doesn't need a neural interface or motion capture system. So you can build more tanks with the same resources. So that leaves contrived reasons: We have giant humanoid chassis from some outside source that are just better than any tank we can build for whatever reason: Robots built by aliens for some inscrutable reason, or maybe giant alien carcasses. We don't have the capability to make the same materials from scratch or to re-shape them into more practical forms. Magic in some form is used to operate them and for whatever reason, magic vehicles work better if human shaped. The same goes if magic is called something else like 'psionics'. They aren't meant to be practical. Like much of the Goa'uld technology in Stargate, there are psychological/social reasons to have a design that's much less effective than could be produced otherwise. The imperial walkers in Star Wars are probably best explained as terror weapons. They are just better by authorial fiat because the author wants giant war robots. This explains them in most settings that have them including Gundam, Macross, and Battletech. 

This is an interesting question, and there are some subtleties in addressing it. There are 2 key timescales for your unstable system: the time until instability sets in, and the duration of the instability. The time until instability can vary -- there are trends in N-body simulations (basically, the closer your planets' initial orbits the faster they go unstable) -- but no absolute law. Plus, those N-body simulations are quite idealized and it's easy to imagine systems in which planets go unstable only after a significant delay (e.g., top movie on this page). The time before instability is pretty boring. In technical terms, the planets' orbits are exploring available parameter space but most of this amounts to staying on roughly circular, well-behaved orbits. Instabilities themselves can be pretty dramatic. Giant planets tend to eject each other into interstellar space, leaving behind eccentric orbits (see $URL$ ) whereas terrestrial planets are more likely to end up colliding. There are other outcomes, which can range from disastrous (giant collision between planets, or one hits the star), arduous (being flung into insterstellar space to survive as a free-floating planet; see here), or not that bad (avoiding collisions and only having tidal stretching issues during close encounters and an eccentric orbit). The time during the instability includes periods when the orbit is fixed punctuated by very dramatic close gravitational encounters between planets, which would tidally stretch them and impart strong gravitational kicks that suddenly change the planets' orbits. This would be a very exciting time to live on such a planet, even though you would be doomed... For more on planets with oscillating orbits, see here: $URL$ Your situation would be similar but with a very interesting chaotic element thrown in. I forgot to mention that the duration of instability depends on the situation also. Gas giant instabilities tend to end quick (~100,000 years). For Neptunes it can be much longer (millions). For terrestrial planets it depends -- in some cases it can be very long. 

No. Earth is entirely habitable to humans despite the presence of dinosaurs. In fact it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility that we would bring along dinosaurs if we were setting up a colony. Chickens in particular. 

The idea of knocking a satellite out of its orbit is common in fiction, but what does it actually mean. 

Whatever magic was used to slow it down without rendering it completely uninhabitable in the first place is the most likely means of speeding it up, without rendering it uninhabitable. The rotational energy of the Earth is on the order of $10^{29}~\mathrm{J}$. Applying that amount of energy in a controlled enough way that all of it goes into speeding up or slowing down the rotation without even a tiny fraction getting turned into something like heat (and melting the entire surface in the process) or being unevenly distributed (potentially tearing the planet apart, although most of it would stay gravitationaly bound together and would reform) is pretty much pure magic. 

A hierarchical triangulated irregular network (HTIN) is probably what you are after. A TIN consists of a delauny triangulation over a set of point samples which are distributed based on the frequency of the surface being modelled. Where the surface varies rapidly, the points are dense, and where the surface does not vary, the points are sparse. In a hierarchical TIN, the points and their triangulation incorporate an order of precedence and a spatial index so that sections of the triangulation can be extracted at specific levels of detail. 

Just a quick note that it's important to realize that there is no liquid water in a protoplanetary disk because the pressure is too low. There's just water vapor where it's hotter than about 150 K (a little colder than -100 degrees Celsius), and ice where it's colder than that. No liquid anywhere I'm afraid. 

My goal was to keep a planet in constant dalyight (like in Asimov's story Nightfall). So the details are different than your idea but the jist is the same. So here is how to set this up. Stick a 1 million Solar-mass black hole in the center. Take as many stars as you want, but make sure there are at least 7 of each specific type. Make a ring of each set of stars, with successive rings spaced out sufficiently to maintain stability (see here). Throw your planet in there on its own orbit, in between rings or interior/exterior to the rings. Or the planet could orbit one of the stars in one of the rings if you prefer. And boom, there you go! Celestial mechanics can work nicely if you set it up just right. Of course, such a system would be prone to breaking if there were any significant perturbations. But left to itself it's totally stable -- to reiterate, I've checked with N-body simulations. 

Sometimes when someone says a map is "small scale", it seems to mean a map shows a small area, but the things are drawn large as a result, and other times it means the things in the map are shown much smaller, allowing for a large area to be shown. 

Life would have to originate within an environment which it could survive. Life that operates within a liquid water medium like us would only be able to occur in an environment where water can be liquid. Keeping water liquid by solar radiation, and water based life are not the only options though. Radioactivity, tidal forces (for a moon of a gas giant), or residual energy from the formation of the planet might provide the heat to melt water. This is not as good of an environment for life, at least as we are familiar with it, as solar heated open water, but that may be bias on our part as life that developed in solar heated water. Life could also develop to not use liquid water. Ammonia is the most often cited alternative. Liquid Methane might also work. I think ammonia tends to break down in high frequency light which limits what kinds of stars can have planets with enough ammonia. 

There are several ways for 2 planets to share the same orbit. The simplest is for them to be in each other's mutual L4/L5 Lagrange points, essentially staying 60 degrees apart along their orbit. 

To re-iterate my key point, the whole concept of the goldilocks zone is very limited. Earth itself -- with its current properties -- has at least 4 possible stable climates (see here: $URL$ We are lucky to be in the goldilocks climate. 

Wikipedia even has a page on "double planets" here. And I used them to build systems with lots and lots of planets in the habitable zone: see here and here. 

Not much would change without the Moon. It is often suggested that the Moon was key for life on Earth but there are nothing concrete to back that up (for example, see here: $URL$ For instance, Earth's axial tilt is indeed stabilized by the Moon at Earth's current spin rate. However, after formation Earth spun much faster (the exact rate was determined by the last couple giant impacts on Earth). At a faster spin rate, the Moon is not needed to stabilize Earth's spin. And newer work suggests that a Moon-less Earth would still have a pretty stable spin axis. So, the Moon never actually made much of a difference in terms of stabilizing Earth's spin axis. However, Earth-Moon tidal interactions did cause the Moon to be pushed farther from the Earth and the Earth's spin rate to slow down (making the day longer) The day-night cycle is only affected by the Moon in terms of the length of the day (which would be much shorter, probably around 4 hours long, without the Moon). The seasons don't care about the Moon, and neither does the surface temperature. There are a lot of mysteries related to the origin of the Moon (e.g., $URL$ And there are a lot of opportunities for imagining life on moons in science fiction (like Pandora: $URL$ But I don't think the Moon disappearing would have that big of an effect on the Earth. 

It's conceivable that a plant that is able to acquire nutrients and moisture as it grows (rather than from a central root) would be able to just keep growing horizontally until it runs out of space or dies. Vertically it would be constrained by its ability to support itself and to draw water. A daisy in particular doesn't grow to the size of a dinner plate because the complex set of biochemical processes that cause a daisy to grow the way it does and to become a daisy rather than say a water buffalo result in it growing to be daisy sized and then stopping. A simple scaling of a daisy would cause the same square-cube problems as scaling pretty much anything. Doubling the linear dimensions of a daisy would make it 4 times stronger, but 8 times heavier. A dinner plate sized daisy would collapse under its own weight. We could selectively breed daisies to get bigger, but as they did, we'd need to breed them to support their new size. A daisy bred to be dinner plate sized would need to have a radically different structure from a a scaled up daisy (Stem would need to get thicker faster than the other scaling, a tougher woodier composition, restructuring the head to be lighter for its size, etc.) 

Those images are from a very packed system I created a few months ago: $URL$ Here is another example with one planet and 5 Suns: $URL$ 

I think what you are talking about is not really the stellar metallicity but the heavy metal abundance relative to rock (e.g., measured as X/Si). To have a planet with a high abundance of heavy metals, you need the ratio of metals to rock to be high. I think that is what you are after: rocky planets with lots of heavy metals, right? The stellar metallicity is the grouped abundance of everything heavier than He relative to Hydrogen. So, a higher metallicity gives you more planetary building blocks but not more metals relative to rock. One important fact is that the occurrence of low-mass (presumably terrestrial) planets does not correlate with metallicity. This is an observed fact (for example, see this paper: $URL$ Higher metallicity stars form more gas giant planets, which tend to become unstable and destroy terrestrial planets. Back to your setup. First, it's definitely plausible to imagine lots of planetary system in relatively dense stellar clusters. There are plenty of planets in open clusters. Globular clusters are an extreme example but why not. As long as there are no encounters closer than, say, 5 times the planets' orbital distance. Now, how to get your planets lots of heavy metals? Well, to enrich them in, anything heavier than iron requires R-process nucleosynthesis and therefore a supernova. Different types of supernovae produce different elemental patterns but I don't remember enough from grad school about the differences ($URL$ I know that supernova ejecta is clumpy, so it's easy to imagine some stars being polluted by heavy metal-rich clumps while others are not. Of course, there are other ways of packing lots of rocky planets within 1000 AU (shameless plug: $URL$ 

Making things bigger or smaller is common in speculative fiction (giant ants, tiny people, planets bigger than stars, and stars smaller than light bulbs.) What general principles should be kept in mind when making things bigger or smaller? 

For convenience lets use white (W) as a code pair separator to keep in sync and black (K) as a word separator and we can reasonably encode written English as a sequence of colours and therefore any concept expressible in English can be represented in a colour language. KYYWRBWYMWYMWGGKCBWGGWGMWYMWRCK Of course this isn't meant to be a good colour language. It's merely a demonstration that the medium of the language does not constrain its expressive power. We could re-encode any language into any linguistic medium this same way. 

We already do generate magnetic fields. Pretty much all matter does. Electromagnetism is what makes matter behave the way we expect matter to behave. We also generate electrical currents, which produce electromagnetic fields. The former could be increased by containing large quantities of suitably arranged and magnetized ferromagnetic materials; A life form with permanent magnets embedded in it. The latter could also be increased by producing larger electrical currents, and by arranging them in suitable circuits (coils for instance) to produce electromagnets. Biological electrical currents are generally short pulses rather than sustained so biological electromagnets would be similar pulses. A biological sustained electromagnet would require a rather different process, probably like a refuelable battery or fuel cell fed by biological chemical sources.
