the law $w$ characterizes the trivial group among all groups; the law $w$ characterizes the trivial group among all cyclic groups of prime order; the image of $w$ in the abelianization of the free group is a primitive element. 

In a series of 3 articles ($*$), Luigi Onofri studied the group of permutations $\mathrm{Sym}(I)$ of an infinite countable set $I$. He notably proved (in the third article, 1929) that this group has exactly 4 normal subgroups: $$\{1\}\subset\mathrm{Alt}(I)\subset\mathrm{Sym}_{\mathrm{fin}}(I)\subset\mathrm{Sym}(I)$$ where $\mathrm{Sym}_{\mathrm{fin}}(I)$ is the subgroup of finitely supported permutations ("substitutions operating on finitely many elements") and $\mathrm{Alt}(I)$ is its subgroup of index 2 of even finitely supported permutations. See $URL$ for more details. This now classical result was rediscovered by Schreier and Ulam (1933, ${*}{*}$) and is so far exclusively attributed to Schreier-Ulam [with the notable but isolated exception of (${*}{*}{*}_1$), 1956 and (${*}{*}{*}_2)$, 1962], often as Baer-Schreier-Ulam theorem, referring to a subsequent extension (1934) by Baer to a classification of normal subgroups of the symmetric group over an arbitrary infinite set.

The group of pwop (piecewise order-preserving) permutations of $\mathbf{N}$ is equivalent to the full symmetric group (i.e., has the same orbits on the power set $2^\mathbf{N}$. These are permutations for which there's a finite partition such that on every component, the permutation is order-preserving. It is transitive on moieties (infinite subsets with infinite complement) and obviously is also transitive on finite subsets of given cardinality. You can google "transitive on moieties" to find more. 

We say that $Q$ is a safe quotient of $G$ if the projection $G\to Q$ is safe. Remark: $f$ safe implies that $f$ is injective in restriction to any finite subgroup: indeed the first condition is that non-conjugate finite subgroups map to non-conjugate subgroups; applying this to $\{1\}$ and the cyclic subgroup generated by some element of finite order, we conclude. The second condition means, in rough terms, that a finite subgroup of $G$ cannot be embedded in a larger finite subgroup in $H$, except in a way that comes from $G$. "Conjecture": let $G$ be a non-elementary hyperbolic group. 

Edit: Related fact: there is an (explicit, but ineffective) algorithm computing the cardinal of the restricted Burnside group as a function of $(d,n)$: enumerate finite groups of exponent dividing $n$, and thus enumerate all homomorphism to those groups, and thus enumerate presentations of their kernels $K$. At some point, the kernel is aperiodic (i.e., has no nontrivial finite quotient), and we have to detect this: to do so, enumerate finite simple groups $S$ of exponent dividing $n$: there are finitely many and a list can be given (computably) in terms of $n$. We have to be careful because $K$ is only recursively presented, but the fact that there is no nontrivial homomorphism $K\to S$ is equivalent to the fact that some truncated presentation $K'$ of $K$ has no nontrivial homomorphism to $S$, so this will be eventually detected. Now to go back to the initial question: I at least have: if the Burnside groups have uniformly solvable word problem (i.e. the input is $(d,n,w)$ with $w$ a group word in $d$ letters and the output is YES/NO according to whether $w\equiv 1$ in $B(d,n)$) then here's an explicit algorithm for infiniteness of $B(d,n)$: enumerate group words in $d$ and by the above word problem assumption, we can compute when they are distinct and thus compute an increasing sequence whose limit is the cardinal of $B(d,n)$. If $B(d,n)$ is infinite then this number will pass over the cardinal of the restricted $BR(d,n)$ which is also computable by the previous paragraph, so this will be detected; if $B(d,n)$ is finite this is detected also by standard means (enumerate all relations in $B(d,n)$ and stop if for some $k$ all elements of the $k$-ball belong to the $(k-1)$-ball.) 

Yes, even with $H$ cyclic infinite, you can embed $\mathbf{Z}$ into a finitely generated group with finite generating subset so that the restriction to $\mathbf{Z}$ is (up to equivalence) an arbitrary length function whose balls have at most exponential growth (you obviously have to avoid lengths growing as $\log\log(n)$ since its balls grow as double exponentials). So you can get $|g^n|\simeq n/\log(n)$ or even arbitrarily close to linear. This is due to A. Olshanskii. I don't have access to his papers (links on his page do not work at the moment), so I'm not sure of references, it at the end of the 90's. There is also a version with embeddings into finitely presented group, with some more conditions on the length function. 

Indeed, take (a), (b) for granted, and assume by contradiction that $\Gamma$ exists. Then both generators commensurate $X$ and hence $\Gamma$ commensurates $X$. Since the first of this isometries maps $X$ to $X\smallsetminus\{x\}$, its $n$-th power maps $X$ to the complement of $n$ points in $X$: in particular the cardinal of $X\Delta\gamma X$ is unbounded and $X$ cannot be transfixed. So we get a contradiction, unless $\Gamma$ is virtually infinite cyclic, which is ruled out by (b). Finally I'll justify that such "paradoxical" decompositions can occur without any reference to free subgroups: 

No, $\mathrm{Ann}(R)$ does not necessarily hold when $R$ is generated as a ring by idempotents. Let $K$ be a field, or more generally any commutative (associative) ring with 1. Let $R$ be the (associative, non-unital) $K$-algebra of matrices $m(e,a,b,c)=\begin{pmatrix}0 & a & c\\0 & e & b\\ 0 & 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}$ with $a,b,c,e\in A$. Then $m(0,0,0,1)$ belongs to $\mathrm{Ann}(R)$. On the other hand, all elements of the form $m(1,a,b,ab)$ are idempotents, and the idempotents $m(1,0,0,0)$, $m(1,1,0,0)$, $m(1,0,1,0)$, $m(1,1,1,1)$ form a basis of $R$ as a $K$-module; in particular they generate $R$ as a ring (and even as an additive group) when $K=\mathbf{Z}$ or $\mathbf{Z}/n\mathbf{Z}$. 

Over any PID $R$, using the classification of submodules of f.g. free modules, you can get that orbits of the left-right action of $\mathrm{GL}_n(R)\times \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$ on $\mathrm{M}_n(R)$ have representatives given by diagonal matrices, and the question boils down to understand which matrices are in the same orbit. Two diagonal matrices are in the same orbit if they are equal up to multiplication by an invertible diagonal matrix, and up to conjugation by permutation matrices, but this is not the only condition: for instance, the matrices $A=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\ 0 & 6\end{pmatrix}$ and $B=\begin{pmatrix}2 & 0\\ 0 & 3\end{pmatrix}$ are in the same orbit, because the endomorphism $B$ can be written as $A$ in the pair of bases $((1,1),(3,2))$, $((2,3),(1,1))$. Maybe the only good invariant is the "local" one, that is, to check for each prime how many times this prime appears in the diagonal entries, and with which multiplicity. For the left-right action of $\mathrm{SL}_n(R)\times \mathrm{SL}_n(R)$, the determinant also has to be fixed, and this is the only other invariant: if two diagonal matrices with the same determinant are in the same orbit for the left-right action of $\mathrm{GL}_n(R)\times \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$, say $D_1=UD_2V$, then letting $S$ be the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries $(\det(U),1,\dots,1)$, we have $D_1=(US^{-1})D_2(SV)$, and both $US^{-1}$ and $SV$ have determinant 1. So everything boils down the the left-right action of $\mathrm{GL}_n(R)\times \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$. If the ring is Euclidean, $\mathrm{EL}_n(R)=\mathrm{SL}_n(R)$ so we are in the previous case. So the only issue is to classify precisely diagonal matrices are in the same orbit for the left-right action of $\mathrm{GL}_n(R)\times \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$ on $\mathrm{M}_n(R)$. 

2 examples: a manifold and a tree: 1) Consider the group $G_s=\mathbf{R}^2\rtimes\mathbf{R}$, where $s>1$ and the action is given by $t.(x,y)=(e^tx,e^{st}y)$. Endow it with a negatively curved left-invariant Riemannian metric (it exists, by Heintze); let $X$ be the resulting Riemannian manifold, it is transitive. I claim that $H=\mathrm{Isom}(X)$ has no lattice (so $X$ is not periodic). Indeed, otherwise $H$ is unimodular; also $H$ is Gromov-hyperbolic and is not focal because it is unimodular, and $H_0$ is not compact, from which it follows by standard results that if $W$ is the maximal compact normal subgroup in $H$, $H/W$ is an open subgroup in the isometry group of some rank 1 symmetric space of noncompact type, and since the Gromov boundary of $H$ is 2-dimensional, this can only be the 3-dimensional real hyperbolic space. But $G_s$ does not embed cocompactly into $\mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^3(\mathbf{R}))$, contradiction. 2) Start with a trivalent regular tree; first endow it with the usual distance, and fix a Busemann function $b$. Let the length of and edge $e$ be 1,2,3 according to whether $b(e)$ equals $[0,1]$, $[1,2]$, or $[2,3]$ modulo 3. If $T$ is the resulting tree with the new distorted distance, $\mathrm{Isom}(T)$ is cocompact on $T$ and fixed a point at infinity, hence is not unimodular, so has no lattice, thus $T$ is cocompact and not periodic. 

Proof. If $G=1$ there is nothing to prove. Assume that H is not semisimple and $G\neq 1$. Then there exists a 1-dimensional torus $T$ in $H$ and a closed normal subgroup $N$ of codimension 1 such that $TN=H$. Define $T=T\cap N$, so that $Z$ is finite and define $T'=T/Z$. Then $\mathrm{Hom}(T',G)$ can be identified to the set of elements in $\mathfrak{g}$ whose exponential is 1; we have already seen that it has infinitely many components. We have a continuous restriction map $\mathrm{Hom}(H,G)\to \mathrm{Hom}(T,G)$. Its image contains $\mathrm{Hom}(T',G)$ (identified to those homomorphisms trivial on $N$), and $\mathrm{Hom}(T',G)$ is clopen in $\mathrm{Hom}(T,G)$ (indeed, let $Z$ have exponent $n$; then 1 is an isolated point in the set $K$ of elements $g\in G$ such that $g^n=1$ and $\mathrm{Hom}(T',G)$ is the fiber of $(1,\dots,1)$ for the mapping $\mathrm{Hom}(T,G)\to K^Z$ mapping $f$ to $z\mapsto f(z)$). Thus $\mathrm{Hom}(H,G)$ has infinitely many components (the proof even shows that it has a continuous map onto an infinite discrete set). 

1 B.H. Neumann's construction Reference: B.H. Neumann. Some remarks on infinite groups. J. London Math. Soc. 1(2) (1937) 120--127. He considered a strictly increasing sequence $(m_n)$, $m_n\ge 5$ tending to infinity, of odd numbers, and $X_n$ a copy of $\{1,\dots,m_n\}$, and $X=\bigsqcup_n X_n$. Let $c$ act as the 3-cycle $(123)$ on each $X_n$, and $t$ act as the full cycle $(1,\dots,m_n)$ on all $X_n$. Consider $\Gamma=\langle t,c\rangle$. This is residually finite (since orbits are all finite). Neumann checks that $\Gamma$ has a homomorphism onto $\mathbf{Z}$, mapping $t$ to 1 and $c$ to 0. Moreover, its kernel contains a smaller normal subgroup, the finitely supported even permutations preserving all $X_n$ (that is, $\bigoplus_n\mathrm{Alt}_{m_n}$). The quotient is the semidirect product $\mathrm{Alt}(\mathbf{Z})\rtimes\mathbf{Z}$, where $\mathbf{Z}$ acts by shifing. This construction is an illustration of the fact that every finitely generated LEF group is quotient of a FC-central group, which can be chosen of the form $\bigoplus_n F_n$ with each $F_n$ finite and normal in the whole group. Note that it also, by the way, provides examples of residually finite 2-generator groups that are (locally finite)-by-$\mathbf{Z}$ (hence poly-(virtually abelian)) and not virtually solvable (as your example and mine in (3) below), but unlike those, satisfy no group identity. 2 Comments on your construction First let me rewrite it when $K$ is a simple group and $H=\mathbf{Z}$. Since the singletons $K/K$ play no role, let me remove it. So $$X=\bigsqcup_{n\ge 1}K^n,$$ where $\mathbf{Z}$ acts on $K^n$ by shifting, and $K$ acts on $K^n$ by left multiplication at 0 (that is, $k\cdot (k_0,k_1,\dots,k_{n-1})=(kk_0,k_1,\dots,k_{n-1})$. These two operations on $K^n$ simply provide a simply transitive action of the wreath product $K\rtimes\mathbf{Z}/n\mathbf{Z}$. When putting things together, one gets a group which, modulo its subgroup of finitely supported permutations, is the wreath product $K\wr\mathbf{Z}$, another typical example of a finitely generated LEF group that is not residually finite. Actually, this is exactly the kind of construction one gets when one tries to make explicit the proof of the LEF fact mentioned above. A variant would consist in choosing, instead of the simply transitive action of $K\wr\mathbf{Z}/n\mathbf{Z}$, rather its "natural" action, which is on the disjoint union of $n$ copies of $K$, or even, for $K=\mathrm{Alt}_5$ on $n$ copies of $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$. Another consequence is that these groups are not isomorphic to mine described in (3). Indeed, by construction, your group has a nontrivial FC-center, since it contains nontrivial finitely supported permutations (for an explicit example, let $t$ be the generator of $\mathbf{Z}$, and choose in $K$ two non-commuting elements $b,c$; then $[tbt^{-1},c]$ is supported by the first copy). While my example in (3) has a trivial FC-center. 

For odd $k$, the shift in $X^k$ has no square root (and hence does not lie in a 1-parameter subgroup). Indeed, the the set of 2-periodic points can be identified with $(I^k)^2$, where the shift acts as $(x,y)\mapsto (y,x)$. It would then preserve the set of fixed points, namely the diagonal $(x,x)$, so any root should preserve the subset of points of period 2, the set $M^k_2$ or pairs of distinct points of $\mathbf{R}^n$. There is an obvious homotopy retract of the latter to the set of pairs $(x,-x)$ where $x$ ranges over the unit sphere $\mathbf{S}^{k-1}$, commuting with the flip (first homotope the center to 0 and then renormalize...). Here the flip can be identified with the antipode map. Since $k$ is odd, the antipode of the $(n-1)$-sphere is orientation-reversing and hence its action of the antipode on the real cohomology $H^{k-1}(\mathbf{S}^{k-1},\mathbf{R})\simeq H^{k-1}(M^k_2,\mathbf{R})\simeq\mathbf{R}$ is given by sign change and hence has no square root. So the flip of $M^k_2$ has no square root for odd $k$. For even $k$, $I^k$ is a square and hence the shift map has an obvious square root (and we can even find a 1-parameter subgroup interpolating the flip in $M^k_2$), so another argument would be needed.
