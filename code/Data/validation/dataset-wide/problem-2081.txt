Similar to the first one, this is such a basic question that hearing someone ask it would make me question why they were hired in the first place. Now IF this person was hired straight out of college then I'd give a bit of latitude. However if they had advertised themselves as being proficient in the relevant tech then I wouldn't cut them one bit of slack. Heck, I'd probably bring it up with the boss during an elevator ride: "Can you believe X doesn't know the difference between a snapshot and a copy? Where are you finding these people? Hope you got a good deal. lol" 

Very few deadlines are actually non-negotiable. If it really was non-negotiable then there would have been more than 1 person on the project. For the simple reason of the risk of you no longer being available to work on it and therefore the possibility of the deadline being missed. 

It would be far easier for you to try and join this new team as an individual member than to get them to simply collaborate with your entire team if there are other non-tech domain experts in the company. Make no mistake, this is a political war. I've been on the "mad scientist/skunk ops" side of things before and if you guys weren't consulted ahead of time about this new group then you are already on the losing side. 

The tired part is not germaine. The question is whether he is doing the assigned work; which it sounds like he is. So one potential option is to just leave it alone. Your statements seem to imply that over time is very common in your company. If this is the case, the I'd suggest talking with your managers about how to be properly staffed. Regardless, there are many many reasons that people won't normally do overtime such as strong desire for family/personal time, etc. There are also many reasons why people keep part time jobs. At 37.5 hours a week, it sounds like he's only part time. If this means he doesn't have benefits like health insurance then it's entirely possible he's keeping the restaurant job for those items... unlikely but possible. How I'd approach this: If I felt that he would be a stronger employee then I would contact my manager and get prior approval to bump the guys pay to an amount that exceeded what he's making in his part time job. If he is considered "part time" then I'd also see if moving him to full time, with all the associated benefits, was possible. Once secured, I would approach the employee and let him know that if he is willing to quit the restaurant job and focus on this job full time then he'd get this raise. His reaction at that point will tell you everything you need to know. However, if I couldn't secure the above from management first then I would drop the issue entirely. His work appears to be acceptable as is which is far better than a lot of people out there. 

I've been here: having a partner who verbally agrees to one thing then turns completely around. It can be very hard to remove them. You have a couple problems. The first is that this person is a 1/3 owner. Now that does not normally entitle them to a salary. However it does entitle them to profit sharing. The "bonus" you pay yourself at the end of the year is just that. Profit sharing is normally divided up by taking the total profits (or whatever amount up to that you are comfortable with) and giving each owner a percentage based on their percentage ownership in the company. So if this guy owns 1/3 then he gets 1/3 of the bonus. I'd say you need to take care of this right now. Next, as an owner he does have specific rights to the financials. Speak to an attorney to determine exactly what level of information he is supposed to have. Now this information is confidential, however he can share it with appropriate counsel. If you have proof he is sharing it beyond that then you have a specific issue your attorney can help you with. Did I mention talk to an attorney? In my case a partner thought that sharing financials with a competitor was a good idea. Now looking at those end of year bonuses... you might consider just plowing that money right back into the business. Growth is a good thing and if there is no bonus, well... Finally, get with your other partner and figure out what the value of the company is. Be realistic and research how to put a value on a company. Then make an offer to this third wheel to buy them out. Now one possible approach is a scorched earth policy. Close the business, sell the assets and give this person their share. If it's as small as you say then your assets are likely just stock on hand plus whatever is in the bank. That's not likely to be a whole lot and may be quite a bit less than trying to buy this person out of the company. 

If a lost key is such a security issue that they would need to re-key all of those locks, then it seems to me that the potential for keys being copied would be of a similar risk level. That said, do they plan on re-keying all the locks every time an employee quits or is terminated? Because having this agreement in place ensures that most, if not all, employees are going to have copies of their keys made just in case they lose one. If I was intent on working there that's the very first thing I'd do. Then I'd leave the original at my house and keep the copy on me. I think pointing out things like this to management prior to signing such an agreement would encourage them to just pop for the electronic locks. 

*bolding is mine. I'm not sure what happens if you haven't been informed in advance. However, I suspect this is laid out in your employee handbook. 

I wouldn't give that out to them; not even a "portion" of it. There is no reason to give any part of your social security number to anyone other than someone you have a financial relationship with. By that I mean that they are loaning you money or paying you. It's necessary for loans for reporting to credit tracking agencies and it's necessary to pay you because they need to report it to the IRS. Quite frankly I'd review the reason why I was considering doing business with any company that asked for that information from me. If there are others who perform this service that I'm willing to work with then I'd move on. If there aren't then I'd simply tell them no. If they say "we just use it for internal tracking" then I'd probably point out that they have an internal security problem and I'd rather not become part of that mess. Bear in mind that numerous companies such as Amazon and Apple have been hit hard because their customer service people have asked for part of a social in order to reset passwords... If they state that they need it for a "background check" then I'd let them know that I will happily allow the company I receive an offer from do this. That said, after 30+ years of working in the USA I've never once seen a recruiter actually perform a BG check. Employers usually can't afford to trust them.
