BB height is something that is very important in mountain biking, as well as other disciplines. It effects where the riders center of gravity is in relation to the bike and to the ground. Generally speaking, a higher BB height will lead to a higher center of gravity making the bike harder to turn when the rider leans into the turn. A higher BB can help you clear obstacles though, especially when you consider how far down a big ring may hang from the BB. Judging BB height visually is something you'll have to learn from experience or by putting a couple bikes next to each other. How good are you at judging a 5mm difference? If you can't then judging BB height is pretty much useless unless you're comparing a hybrid touring bike to a full downhill bike. Another important point is that not all chainstays will be straight. What about full suspension bikes? Some of those chainstays arc up and not tell you anything about BB height. Suspension also means that as you put weight and/or pressure on the bike the BB height will lower as the suspension moves through it's travel. 

Wheels don't need to match and neither do tires, unless you're really picky about that sort of thing. Sometimes the wheel is damaged (out of true, bent, cracked, etc) and needs to be replaced. Other times it's changed to meet a specific need such as wanting a rim that supports a wider tire or a stronger rim if you're riding over tougher terrain. Personally, I ride (mountain bike) with a wider rear tire to run a larger tire for more grip. Fortunately, I bought a wheelset so mine match, but I could just as easily have run my previous front wheel and had a mismatching set. You could also get really granular and look at what spokes, nipples, hubs, and rim strips are the wheels, but having differences in these between front in back won't make the bike un-ridable, it will simply change the way each wheel works. 

I've got the regular Freeride shoes and love how sticky they are. Haven't tried the new VXi ones, but I think the spot with no tread pattern would be a little nicer since you don't have to lift your foot to reposition. I'd recommend reading Pinkbike's review as they cover most of the relevant points. 

Because I'm a mountain bike guy, and I think the stories and shots are way more interesting (sorry roadies): 

You are in luck! There are tons of threads on many forums talking about this very thing. However, I'll give you a head start. 

I'm sure there's also some structural reasons about balancing forces and stresses on nthe bike (which probably explains why the seat stays usually meet the seat tube around the same spot as the top tube). 

Short answer: depends. Long answer: Braking is as much a style as other parts of riding, but there are some general guidelines. The longer you hold those brakes, the more the heat will build up and braking performance will decrease. You'll also burn through pads a lot faster that way. On the other hand, sudden braking puts quite a bit of stress on the bike all the way from the rotor through the fork/rear triangle, to the handlebars and chain. It also changes the way the suspension moves through it's travel. When should use either of these methods? I generally use a longer, controlled brake when descending a steep chute that requires a bit more technical riding or doesn't have a great runout after the rough bits. Quick braking is useful when you're plowing into a corner and need to scrub some speed quick or plan on drifting around it. You can also brake right before dropping in to a section so that the wheels roll over the rocks and roots instead of sliding and then roll out the bottom. Really it's going to come down to how you ride and where you like to make speed changes. Experiment and find what's comfortable and what meets your needs. If you're trying to carry crazy speed you might find a quick, hard brake is more beneficial, etc. 

The question title pretty much sums it up, but has a bike with an alternate drivetrain style like this been made? This would mean a derailleur mounted essentially upside down with the tension pushing the chain upward. I could see where this would protect the derailleur and keep the chain out of the way from dust and debris more. However, I could also envision some issues with front shifting due the the chain coming up from the front chain ring as well. Pictures would be much appreciated! 

One of the most common uses of old tubes that I've seen/used is to wrap your drive-side chainstay with one. It's cheaper than buying a dedicated protector and it's readily replaceable. Just cut the tube somewhere and wrap it around the chainstay, and then secure it with either zip ties or some tape. Another fun idea is doing a ghetto tubeless setup where you've got anywhere from a whole inflated tube, to just have the tube as a liner inside your tire. 

Form letters: Do you write a form letter/email and essentially send the same thing to every company and hope they bite? Or would it be better to personalize each? Sponsorship level: How do you figure out who gets to be the primary sponsor and who gets a tiny logo on your bike? Is this done before contacting places, or after amounts/materials have been decided? Influence of on/off the bike: Obviously you are a brand ambassador of the sponsor, but how much should you emphasize your contribution when on or off the bike. Everyone will see your kit when racing, but will another helmet for dirt jumping help sell the brand too, for example. 

It partially depends on where the cable comes out of the post. If it's from the top you can route the cable across the bottom of the top tube and up to the handle bar or down the seat tube and up the down tube. On the other hand, if the cable comes out of the bottom of the post, you can try to go out the bottom of the seat tube and up the down tube. What is also becoming more common on frames without designated routing for dropper posts is to run a 1x setup and re-use the routing for the front derailleur cable for the dropper cable. 

A fork with less travel (or similar travel but a shorter overall length) will steepen the head angle which will make your steering a bit quicker and more responsive. Now, this does reduce the force applied to the lower part of the head tube, but due to the change in angle, increases the force applied to the upper part. 

Just trying to stay smooth is about the only advice you need. And don't land to flat! That puts a lot of stress on everything. 

I recently picked up a set of Avid DB1's and put them on my bike, but it was a bear to get them on. For background, they've got a split clamp that is similar to a seat tube where simple compression keeps it in place versus a two-piece clamp that requires more than one screw to tighten. What I found was that the clamp, even when loosened all the way, would not slide down the handlebar and I had to shimmy it back and forth to move them further in, which ended up scratching and removing a large amount of paint (it's ok, that part goes under the grips). But this doesn't seem right to me. Is there: 

Although, I'll agree that those are rather large cuts for a pinch flat, but the alignment/position strongly suggests that. 

After a little Google research of this bike, you can see that the fork is assembled correctly. What's going on is that the crown (the part the stanchions attach to) is bent/twisted or the steer tube (the tube that runs through to the handlebars) is bent. Either way, you're going to need some mechanic work or a new fork. On a side note, you can probably remove the stanchions from the crown, but judging by the amount of rust in your pictures, they're probably fairly stuck by now. 

Like all good answers: yes and no. Having ridden several "fatties," I can say that the wider contact patch and added grip certainly makes for a more confident feeling, but the lower air pressure and subsequent squishy-ness can sometimes make steering a touch...different. There's also the question of how skinny are the skinnies you want to ride? A fat tire might be too fat! I would say, learn on whatever bike you want to ride them on more often as you'll build more comfort. Start small with "wide" skinnies that are low to the ground so that the consequences are smaller. But if you want a fatty to ride in the winter, then all means ride with that. 

a better way to install them? different handlebar diameters that would complicate installation? something else I totally missed? 

Now, there's a small technique that will help you out regardless of conditions and tires: the bunny hop. By lifting even your front tire over the rail, you've eliminated half of your traction problem. Getting the back tire up will pretty much erase the issue all together. 

Check out GoalZero, they make a bunch of portable solar products. While it's a little bit pricy they are quality products that will last. My buddy uses one when we are gone racing and have no access to electricity, and it works quite well for phones and other small electronics. I have also seen, but don't really know much about, people putting these on their hydration pack while they ride (just don't crash). 

A lot of motocross/motorcycle gloves have support built into the fingers to prevent excess motion in the wrong direction (like these). There are a few DH mountain biking gloves that have "armor" on the fingers that restrict movement a bit. Unfortunately, with braking and tricks and steering, it's important to have a good range of motion in the hand, fingers, and wrist, so you might be doing more harm than good! 

Basing workload or technique on soreness is a poor indicator of what is going on. You could have bad pedaling technique and never feel it or have great technique with no fitness and feel sore right away. It's likely that you are not using your calf muscles as much when you cycle as when you do stairs. Stair running is a great way to train most of the muscles in the leg, and the extension/flexion coming from the edge of the stair is what causes your calves to be sore later. While I don't have any professional experience to back this up, I believe that cycling doesn't quite put your foot through the same range of motion, thereby activating the calf less(I suppose you could point your foot up and down more, but that's bad form). What you are likely seeing is a comparison between two activities that use similar muscle groups in different levels. Example: pulling up on a pedal (with cage or cleat) is different than simply lifting your leg up to the next stair since the pedal provides some resistance. My recommendation: rest it for a bit, maybe a day or two and then do both activities moderately and see if you notice any pain. If you do, consult a physician about it. 

Usually a gruppo is the parts that make up the drivetrain, and sometimes some of the controls. The rest is add-ons that don't have to match to work together, although this is becoming more true for drivetrains as well. You'll see that higher end parts outside of a group can come in "lines" too. Look at any major manufacturer and you can see this, e.g. RaceFace Atlas. As far as wheels go, there's not really a standard pairing that's going to allow you view those with anything else. Some companies have partnerships with wheel makers and you might see groups that way, but it's pretty rare. The reason for this is that often times wheels are built with hubs, rims, and spokes from different companies or different brands. Last, but not least, don't forget that a groupset is put together by a brand. They're not going to give you a deal on someone else's stuff if they can't make money on it. 

I recently did option 3 for a GT bike that I had powder-coated. I really wanted their new logo with the wings, but all I could find was the old GT letters. All told it was about $40US to get the decals (and extras) printed. 

Bar turns not only look stylish but can also aid in body movements on the bike. If you need to correct position for a landing, such as when you go over a hip, you'll need to turn the bars a bit. As for performance, there is one time it will make a difference, and that's when you use it to 'scrub' a jump. This means it allows you to clear the jump with less height so that you come to the ground quicker and waste less time in the air. But mostly it just looks really cool and generally indicates more skilled (or more fun) riders. 

Disc brakes sometimes need to "bed in," which means the pads will wear quickly at first then settle. During this period you can get some pretty awful sounding noises anywhere from screeching and squealing to grinding. BikeRadar has a great workshop article about how to go through this process. Other than that, have you ridden through some wet areas and maybe picked up some dirt? Contaminants on the the rotors or pads will cause some extra noise as well. Sanding the pads can help remove any surface dirt/grime and improve braking ability as well. Last option would be that there is something wrong with the pads or the pads are mismatched to the type/brand of brake. You could remove them and take a look and see if the wear pattern looks weird or if there's anything lodged in the pads themselves. It's pretty unlikely, but defective parts do happen. 

You should check your limits any time you have a drivetrain issue. That could be poor shifting, dropped chain, or inability to shift. Shifter cable tension should only affect how easily/quickly the derailleur moves. However, there could be a case where too much tension could cause the derailleur to move through the last shift enough to stress past the limit screw, but I think this is unlikely. The rear wheel could be out of dish (centered from side-to-side) which might have moved the cassette further in. Readjusting the limit screws should take care of that, but you might still have shifting issues. (I had the same problem this spring) 

Either way, since you mention the cones are loose, you should pull apart the hub and check the bearings. Look for dirty grease and see how the bearings/races look. Clean and repack if necessary. New grease will always add a bit of friction, but as it breaks down and heats up (during use) it usually becomes more viscous, therefore reducing friction. 

On a rare occurrence this weekend I managed to completely destroy my SRAM PowerLink. So I went over to my LBS and got a new one; however, when I went to install it, it was super hard to close the link (I ended up giving up after a bit since it would only go half way). After giving it a night and then trying again, I decided perhaps I had bent the chain links where the PowerLink was, so I bought a new chain. The chain came with the same PowerLink and I had the same problem. Eventually I got it but now I'm most likely going to need to saw it off (just kidding, will need pliers though) if it needs removing. The only difference I can see is that they went from a gold colored plate to a black one, but it's still 10 speed (and the chain is SRAM as well). Anyone know if they have modified thickness, shape, or anything else? 

While shocks are certainly meant to be locked out and ridden, even over semi-rough terrain, there are probably some limits to the design. I'm not a fork/shock mechanic, but what I know about fluid dynamics tells me that you shouldn't do this too often! When you lock out your fork/shock it limits that compression of the fluids inside or prevents compression at all by preventing other parts from moving. Scenario 1: The fluid isn't allowed to move through the damper. You could cause high pressure build up on a seal or damper and cause it to blow, or even rupture the canister. Scenario 2: The parts are prevented from moving. The forces exerted on the locked parts could be more than they were designed for and could cause premature wear to the point of failure. Again, I'm not a professional, but I wouldn't recommend riding like this regularly. Perhaps a quick email to Fox might be more helpful, as they may have actually done testing to see what happens when a rider rides the rough stuff with a locked-out shock. 

While replacing any part comes down to when you want/can do it, you should replace any damaged part immediately. That's true whether you experience symptoms of failure or not. Missing teeth on a chainring may not seem like a big deal until another one breaks off, causes chain slip or a dropped chain that sends you over the bars and into a tree or rock. Suddenly a missing tooth seems like a big deal. As a side note, you should probably invest in a bashguard/ring if your knocking teeth off your chainrings!
