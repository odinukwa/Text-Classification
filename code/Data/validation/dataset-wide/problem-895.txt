In the story The Fifth Head of Cerberus, the protagonist has a name which is never stated explicitly, different from the "Number Five" by which his father and aunt refer to him. 

All of these and more just from the first two chapters of the book. I'd like to find a comprehensive list of the dialect words used in the book with their meanings. Does such a list exist anywhere already? If not, I would award a bounty to any answerer who compiles one themselves from the book. Partial answers are acceptable - I'd be grateful for help with any of these words, especially "Uhuru na Kazi", which seems to have some significance in the story. 

There are a couple of possible reasons why the spacing was chosen in a different way from that of the original unreversed words (which is, by the way, a very minor stylistic choice) ... 

Gareth Rees's answer is correct (he just beat me to it ), showing how Mr Rochester's story indicates his lover's infidelity as clearly as it could be without him actually finding them in flagrante delicto. However, since your question seems to be casting doubt on Mr Rochester's status as a reliable narrator, I thought it would be interesting to examine the issue of whether or not, or to what extent, we can take his story at face value. Within the frame of the narrative, Mr Rochester is a reliable narrator. Although Jane doubts and mistrusts him in various ways throughout the story, it never occurs to her to believe he has fabricated or misrepresented his own past. Indeed, soon after the conversation in which he tells her of Celine Varens, her thoughts show that she disapproves of some of his past actions but doesn't think to disbelieve his story: 

Ralph Crown mentions in this answer that a particular line in the play Hamlet could be interpreted as Hamlet breaking the fourth wall, and implies that this is common in Shakespeare plays: 

The epilogue of Suldrun's Garden, the first book of Jack Vance's Lyonesse series, is a sort of literary equivalent of a "next time" teaser in a TV series. More than summarising the events so far and describing the current state of affairs, it asks rhetorical questions about what will happen next. Many of these questions act as foreshadowing for significant events in later books: 

It's certainly true that The Neverending Story has a theme of duality: the two parts of the same story feeding into each other; the black and white snakes eating each other's tails; the constant cycle of the Nothing consuming Fantastica and being beaten back by human imagination; the Acharis and the Shlamoofs; Perilin and Goab; and of course the following quote which feeds directly into Karp's analysis of the story as being about an endless symbiotic cycle of good and evil: 

He didn't know about it way back during the Victory Tour, only later on. The quote you're thinking of is from the final chapter of Catching Fire: 

Mrs Alexander knew about Christopher's mother's affair, but not about her 'death'. In the same conversation when she tells Christopher about the affair, he tells her that his mother died. She was shocked to hear this, but she took Christopher's word for it. Perhaps she'd known her neighbours well enough to know about the affair (or perhaps she'd heard about that through gossip from other neighbours who knew them better), but she probably assumed that Christopher's mother had gone away with Mr Shears and she simply hadn't heard about her death. Perhaps the affair was common knowledge in the neighbourhood, and Mrs Alexander assumed that the death was something less talked about (scandal always makes for better gossip than tragedy). After all, if the lie about Christopher's mother's death was good enough to fool Christopher himself - her own son, and a boy with a shrewd and enquiring mind - surely it can't have been something that a neighbour who didn't know the family very well could have seen through. 

It's worth noting that Tolkien based all of his riddles in style, and some of them in actual wording, on classical "old literary" riddles. As mentioned in the answer to Who wrote Tolkien's riddles?: 

Why is there hostility between her and letters? Especially given that her realm exists only in books which are made out of letters. I doubt this is just a throwaway phrase with no particular significance, given the nature of this story and all its meta levels, but whatever the significance is, I'm missing it. 

In Perelandra, the second book of CS Lewis's planets trilogy, the protagonist Ransom is wounded in the heel by the Un-Man/Weston. We learn in the third book, That Hideous Strength, that the wound never really heals. What is the symbolism behind this wound? Since there's so much hidden religious significance in the series and Lewis's works in general, I'm sure there's more to this than meets the eye: either the simple fact of the wound itself, how he got it, or maybe its precise placing in his heel. 

The poem "No Ordinary Sun" by the Maori poet Hone Tuwhare is about a tree's reaction to some kind of deadly threat, the titular "no ordinary sun". Addressing the tree in the second person, the poem warns that it will no longer live happily as before and that there's no point in resisting its fate. You can read the poem in full e.g. here; it's only five verses long. Can we tell for sure what is the catastrophe threatening the tree? My immediate thought when reading the poem was that it could be a nuclear weapon, but is this the only sensible interpretation? Could it also be a more conventional bomb or explosion? Could it even be the actual sun itself, just having become much hotter and more uncomfortable due to climate change? 

I read this book some years ago, probably around 2010, though it was definitely older than that. It had a fairly short and simple title, of the kind one might expect to find on a fairy tale: "The Lost World" or "The Princess's Journey" or something in that vein. My copy was hardback, the cover mainly white with a stylised drawing running across both back and front, featuring a few people, one rather prominently on the front, and a landscape with mountains. At first I thought it might have been written by Philippa Gregory, but I checked through her bibliography and couldn't see it there. The author's surname definitely began with an early letter in the alphabet (A to H) - I remember that from where the book was in my bookcase - and it was probably written by a woman. Edit: on further reflection, I think the author may have been called Maria, with a surname starting with G and possibly Gl. I don't actually remember much of the plot. It was a typical fairy-tale-ish type story: a princess going on a quest? meeting a poor boy in a forest? that kind of thing. The really memorable and distinctive part was that the story was told twice in the same book: once in a relatively short and simple way, prefaced by "this is the story of [title of book] as I first heard it", and then again in a longer way with more details included, prefaced by "this is the story of [title of book] as it was told to me when I wanted to know more". In their essential details, both stories were the same, but there may have been some actual differences between them as well as just extra material in the second retelling. What was the name of this story? I'm sure I'll know it when I see it, but it's still eluding me. 

It seems so, yes. After the game played between Death and Life-in-Death, in which the latter wins the soul of the Ancient Mariner while the former claims all his crewmates, the Mariner is left all alone upon the ship. He is driven to distraction by the corpses, but says he cannot die: 

In Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles, the character Liza-Lu (Tess's sister) plays a very minor background role throughout most of the novel, until near the very end when Tess says she wants Angel to marry her after she, Tess, is gone. Angel and Liza-Lu are seen together in the very final scene, although it's left open whether or not he does end up marrying her after mourning Tess. Why was this twist added to the end? What does it add to the story, mostly a tragedy of lust and love? I always found it weird that Tess would be matchmaking for Angel at that point, especially her own sister. Is it meant to convey the idea that there is always hope for new love, or what?
