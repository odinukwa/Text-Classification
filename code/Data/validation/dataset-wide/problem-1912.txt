I am what would be considered a junior to mid-level programmer, though at this company I am working at(which is my first job in the field) I am more realistically closer to being mid to senior. For months I was the only one programming anything before they hired a few guys with skillsets below mine(no offense to them). I am getting burned out. Firstly, I've done at least 90% of the difficult work in my department since I have started; my co-workers have been consistently given easier tasks or get my expert help when having to make changes to projects I've worked on. I'm exhausted, but this is a symptom of a bigger problem: I feel that I am responsible for far too much. Having done the vast majority of the work(4 apps were written entirely by me), thus I am realistically the only provider of support of more than half of in-house software. I'm at a point where half of my day disappears because of people coming to me for feature requests and bug fixes. To make matters worse, the chain of command at my job is too non-linear; I can easily get 3 people coming straight to me for the same issue in spite of having a ticket system as well as my boss who they should go to first for most things. This is one of the issues I have brought up to no avail. I also find my boss's management style to be lacking, and it has become more lacking as we have acquired more programmers. This isn't entirely his fault, as I feel that he is suffering from a similar problem to mine(why is a growing company's only sysop also the company's only senior developer?). He's so busy with servers that he hasn't done any actual developing or serious code reviews with us in months, yet he tries to enforce design patterns that don't work well and because he isn't working closely with us he becomes frustrated when his patterns have problems. Basically, he allows little creative control. He will also not allow me access to the live servers where my apps run, despite me being given explicit permission to do this by the CEO. Because of this, I'm screwed if he's gone and there's an issue. My perception is that he feels territorial over his domain. Lastly, I feel that my bosses are poor at expressing their ideas. I don't know how I can further express my frustration in this area without coming off as a jerk, except I always take as many notes as I can and still end up not understanding what they want. My bosses don't know [all] these things, as I haven't told them. I've refrained because this is my first job and I'm not normally the kind of person to tell my boss how they should be running their business. However, I am feeling more used-up by the day. I want to tell my bosses that the reason that I'm constantly fixing bugs and whipping features out of thin air without testing them is because they are giving me garbage and that is why they are getting garbage. They haven't given me enough co-worker support, they won't give me the tools/access I need to produce solid work, they don't give me enough information to work with, and they don't give me the time(I'd love to write testing for features if they didn't NEED THEM NOW). Would I be wrong for politely bringing up these issues? Am I spoiled? 

Just say "I'm sorry, I'm really bad with names, could you remind me what your name is?" or something along those lines. Any reasonable person won't be insulted, in fact they'll appreciate you care enough to actually ask. If they are insulted, then they aren't a reasonable person, so there's not much to do about it in that case. But I've never had a single person react negatively when I've asked to be reminded of their name. 

On a regular basis, I have to interact and coordinate with a coworker who is one of those highly opinionated people that has no filter. I find myself avoiding her as much as possible, to the point where I used to enjoy team happy hours, but don't even go any more because of this single individual. Examples of remarks she's made below - individually they sound harmless, but it's the relentless, constant nature of the remarks that are grinding me down and mentally exhausting to be around. 

I usually drink an IPA at work happy hours. Every time, the instant I place my order, she loudly remarks "EW! HOW CAN YOU DRINK THAT? THOSE ARE SO DISGUSTING!" Another coworker and I share a love of metal music, so often we'll have discussions about the merits/demerits of the latest Slayer album, or whatever. Every time: "HOW CAN YOU LISTEN TO THAT? YOU REALLY CALL THAT MUSIC? ALL IT IS IS YELLING!" Spiritual beliefs - something I don't bring up at work, but while at a convention a couple years back, she started questioning my beliefs, along the usual lines of "but why don't you believe [what she believes]?". It got to the point where she was implying I'm a bad person and will go to hell. Food choices - I'm adventurous and will try about anything, but that seems to really bother her, and 90% of the time I order something at a team lunch/happy hour, she'll start in again: "EW! HOW CAN YOU EAT THAT? YOU REALLY THINK THAT TASTES GOOD?!" 

1 In fact, that category contains pretty much everything that’s mentioned dismissively in the highly upvoted answer by “Masked Man”. 

The answers here suggest that most users of the site aren’t from the UK and don’t know the culture, or the Daily Mail. In fact, at my current and previous workplaces in the UK, the Daily Mail would absolute be considered “not safe for work” due to their openly contemptuously racist and sexist contents. The employer would definitely not order it to the office, and while employees may of course bring it — and read it — doing so openly at work would most certainly be frowned upon (and result in a rebuke from either colleagues or a superior), the same way that looking at mildly “NSFW” content on the internet at work might. — Forget racism for a second: How would people here feel if their employer had Playboy lying around at work? I don’t object to the magazine nearly as much as to the Daily Mail but I would feel distinctly uncomfortable (not just) on behalf of female employees. Workplace equality committees would have a field day. The same is true, and to a much larger extent, for the Daily Mail. In addition, there’s a healthy culture of employee empowerment (read: complaining loudly!) in the UK: if employers don’t like something about the workplace, they are expected to complain (“offer feedback”). This ranges from the food in the canteen to the colour of the wallpaper1. It obviously extends to objectionable contents being displayed at work. Of course if your employer (or somebody with their blessing) ordered it then there’s clearly a different culture at work: for one thing I strongly suspect that you don’t have a workplace equality group. I would still say that it doesn’t hurt to ask your coworkers how they feel about this. And not every complaint needs to be escalated to the top immediately — but you can make your objections known if you do so in a non-pushy way. On the other hand, if you feel that your workplace environment largely approves of displaying Daily Mail material at work and you are genuinely unhappy about it then it seems that there isn’t a great “cultural fit” and unless you want to fight an uphill battle to change this, it might be time to look for different employment. — I want to emphasise that it would be silly to something so drastic over the Daily Mail. Doing it over a fundamental lack of cultural fit at the workplace, however, seems apt.
