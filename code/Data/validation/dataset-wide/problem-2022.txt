When applying for jobs far from where you live, it can be time consuming and expensive to travel to interviews. What is the best way to prepare for this and determine if it is worthwhile? The usual advice is to avoid mentioning disabilities or discussing salary until the employer is somewhat committed to employing you. Is it a good idea to mention that due to the distance you would like to discuss these things on the phone? 

Unfortunately it can be difficult to determine before hand what the company's reaction will be, and especially in larger companies it can depend which department you are in. One useful technique is to look for or ask for copies of their policy on disabilities and medical conditions. If they don't have a policy that's probably a bad sign. Beyond that it's best to wait until they have shown interest in you. Depending on the severity of your condition you might be able to do interviews and progress quite far before it becomes an issue. Once they are seriously considering you as a potential employee it is easier to simply tell them about your condition, explain what support or adaptations you will need, and ask if they feel that is okay. It does potentially waste some of your time, but telling them up front before they actually know you and understand that it's not something scary or debilitating might get you nowhere. And of course, you have to be willing to walk away if it doesn't seem right. 

The company has a legal responsibility to accommodate your physical needs, under EU employment rules that will have been transposed into your country's own laws. If the chairs they provide are causing you physical pain and there is an easy solution that doesn't greatly impact your work or cost much, they are required to offer it to you. Have you made it clear to the health and safety officer that you are extremely uncomfortable? If so, and if you believe you can reasonably do your job with a different type of chair, your next step would be HR. 

Send them another message giving a date for the end of your employment. State clearly that you will cease to work for them after that date. Make sure you have evidence that it was received, e.g. registered mail or email reading receipt. That's all you need to do. If they fail to act it's their problem. Concentrate on your next job. 

If it's a temporary contract with only the possibility of extension (not guaranteed) then yes, you should have no issues applying to other places and mentioning your current employer. No-one should expect you to limit your options when your future employment is not guaranteed. Personally, I've done this after 4 months even when I had a permanent contract (subject to passing probation, which I didn't even finish). Employers understand that some places are just bad, and if you have a good CV and can explain to them any issues you are having they will understand. Similarly, I expect they would understand your situation if you simply explained it to them. 

I've been working at my current job for about 7 months. I really like the company, my boss and the job. The pay is great and I'm comfortable in the role. I'm a web developer. The thing is... My husband wants to move in 8 months time! We want to move because we have no family where we are currently located. There is another office/branch for this company near our future home. It would be a move to another country. I don't have a work visa yet but because I am the spouse of a citizen I just have to get my passport stamped when I'm there. I hope that I don't have to quit working here altogether and could transfer or possibly work remotely part time. Other than losing a productive employee I don't see much benefit to transferring me for them. How and when should you tell them about your plans? How do you bring it up? 

I was harassed by my direct supervisor at my old company. The harassement was all verbal and there were potential witnesses but few direct. For example, there were people within hearing distance/sitting in the next cubicle of the verbal abuse but it's not clear to me if they were paying attention. Some of the incidences where a while ago. I'll be needing to ask them if they remember the incidences. I'm guessing it's best to ask for their personal email and then email them the incidences and if they might remember any of them. Obviously, this is a loaded and sesitive topic. Is it best to make a first quick casual contact? Just send them an email saying hello would you like to keep in touch although it does sound awkward. Next ask them if they remember some incidences? Edit: I have already filed a lawsuit against the company. I don't have a lawyer I'm going it on my own. 

If you have been subjected to long term harassment and they refuse to categorize the behavior as bullying or harassment despite the fact that by object measures it was, does that mean they don't care if you quit? They thought that I just didn't want to work there because I did not enjoy being hassled. Is that a sign they want you gone? They refused to own up to their behavior and just said we are 'different people'. 

If you are writing a bullying report for HR but you only have a vague idea of when the incident happened e.g. Early in March what do you say? Do you say that you don't know when? Or explain why you didn't write it down? I feel like this is murky territory. I mean you don't usually write down stuff that someone walks up to you and out of the blue says. 

I would absolutely not tell them the name of any medical condition you may have! It's extraordinarily personal and opens them up to being discriminatory. It would fall under disability discrimination. Also, there is a lot of stigma around certain ailments that might give some uninformed colleagues the willies. The best thing to do is just tell them that you have ongoing 'medical appointments' and that you will adjust your hours around them. If the depression affects your productivity then just tell them that you have a temporary medical condition you are experiencing and it may affect your productivity for time. If they see you looking sad just say you are very tired from the condition. Keep tabs on how things go after you tell them and consult an employment lawyer if they start mistreating you. 

Write up a report on all the issues, with recommendations for fixing them. Present it to senior management. When people question your ability, or you are being evaluated in future, you can cite this report as evidence of your attempts to improve the situation and how you are doing the best you can with what you have. 

You will probably have to leave if you want more money. Your company clearly is not monitoring market rates and offering them to you, and especially since you promised to stop looking is unlikely to be impressed if you come to them with evidence of breaking that agreement. Best to move on now and don't repeat this mistake at your new company. I'd suggest telling them up front as a condition of you accepting the offer that you expect your salary to increase in line with the market, which will likely be well above the 2-3% they might normally offer. The only other option is to keep moving every few years, if employers are unwilling to pay enough to retain staff. 

What you really want to know is if family friendly policies will result in undue burden on yourself. Assuming you don't have some strange notion of "fairness" in not wanting parents to look after their children properly, your real concern is the effect on you. You can ask companies directly about this. Simply state that in the past you have been overloaded or distracted by these policies, and would like to know how this company deals with them. Seeking out companies that don't have a family friendly policy could easily backfire - if they don't give parents basic support, what other kinds of poor working conditions do they have? Do they account for every minute of your day, are the inflexible when you need unexpected extra time off for some reason (e.g. sick relatives, funerals etc)? 

Search engines can help you. Google has tools to help you do this. I don't think Google is blocked in Hong Kong, but if it is you can always use a Chinese search engine like Baidu to similar effect. Google offers an option to display only results from Hong Kong (enter search terms, hit enter, tools menu, country selection). If you have a Google account you can also specify which languages you want results in, so limit it to English. Then search for English terms like "jobs" and "english speaking". When I tried this I saw several sites such as www.indeed.hk and jobsinhongkong.com that are dedicated to English speaking users, and have options to filter by jobs that accept English-only applicants. Similarly, you can search for phrases like "location hong kong". Combined with "careers" or "recruitment" that seems to turn up a few employers with offices there. 

Your health is the most important thing by far. Stress can result in permanent health problems if not treated, so don't try to soldier on if your doctor advises you not to. I have a permanent, incurable disability caused by stress, so learn from my mistake. From an employment point of view mental health issues are no different to physical ones, e.g. if you broke your leg or got the flu. You have a date when you expect to be recovered that you can give to your new employer. In a way it's actually a good test of the new employer, to see how they handle this issue. If they handle it badly, maybe they are not the best place for you. Hopefully they will be understanding, I think the Netherlands is a pretty progressive place when it comes to mental health issues. 

I think you're completely right to do this and sounds like you've prepared a great agreement for your case. I would prepare yourself for them telling you there isn't a budget for it, and that they aren't willing to pay you (or someone else) to make those changes. They may tell you it's a great idea, and that they'd rather you do it outside, or on the side of, your main role. Which is good for getting what you want done, but ultimately adds to your responsibilities and puts pressure on your juggling skills. They might be thinking, it's always worked this way so why should we spend money on this now? That's a hard mindset to change and you might need to prepare yourself for the fact that they may not change it, unless it actually breaks the deliverables. It sounds like this issue is affecting a customer and that may be enough to have them interested. Either way, stick to your guns, especially as you have analysis to back your argument up. Remind them that you are ultimately asking that this is put in place and you're not just going to run with the idea. 

With those points in mind, have a conversation with your employer and politely tell them you won't be coming into work on the date of your birthday. If this goes well, then great, you can have your birthday off. If you get the sense they will fire you if you take your birthday off (in spite of you following the rules), you need to weigh up whether taking your birthday off is worth your job to you. Once you've figured that out, act on it. 

This seems like a difference between expectation and reality. Perhaps because of the interview process. What was your main motivation for applying for that role? What did you see it giving you and where are you hoping to go? Explore your options. Is there scope for this company offering you what you want? Is it worth waiting the time it takes to get you there? Is there a chance for you to champion the change the company needs in organisational process (that you thought it had)? Is there scope for you changing the interview process so they don't hire anyone with the same expectation/reality gap again? Do you want to do those things? Give yourself a time limit. If by the time the time limit is up, and it's definitely clear that company can't get you where you want to be, then move on. Life is too short to waste your time working for a corporation that isn't giving you what you want. 

What does your employment contract say about the number of hours they can ask you to work? What does it say about the notice they need for time off, and in what format (e.g. written, verbal)? 

My answer is one-fold: Accept the promotion. You've pushed for it and earned it, so accept it. It's your employer's responsibility to keep you happy in your role and if the promotion isn't it, then they need to work with you on that. You are within your right to go and find a better role elsewhere when you see fit. This answers B) too. Voilà, you've got the promotion, so you can move on from not having that as something that is holding you back. If your job hunt fails for whatever reason, you're better off than where you started.
