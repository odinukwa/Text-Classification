But then compare the pseudepigraphical book 2 Enoch 30:11 c. 1st Century CE (probably originally in Greek): 

and adjectives modifying prepositional objects can often precede the preposition, making a sort of bracketed construction: 

e.g. L cena → Pt ceia /sejɐ/, Es cena /θena/, It cena /tʃena/, Ro cină /ʧinə/, Ar tsinã /tsinə/ Affrication very often accompanies palatalization, for example in Japanese t,d → tɕ,dʑ/ts,dz before i/ɯ; or English t in question, nature. I understand similar processes have occured in Finnic. However, it is notable that the diachronic stop->fricative lenition does not always have an affrication stage, and can go right from stop to fricative. An example of this is the first Germanic consonant shift, Grimm's law: 

Latin has many examples of postpositions but was characteristically a prepositional language: cum (and rarely some other prepositions) can come either before or after its object: 

Polish also has an interesting "good night": dobranoc, a frozen expression written and pronounced as one word You can tell that dobranoc is a single word because the stress patterns like one word, not two: /dɔ'branɔʦ̑/ vs / 'dɔbra 'nɔʦ̑/. Noc dobra is not found, although dobrej nocy sometimes is. 

So those two sources essentially say "hundred <- ten + suffix". . This is not a complete explanation, but it's certainly suggestive that two of the authors you mention essentially agree. We don't know the nature of the suffix but maybe it's better that we don't, rather than suggest things like "ten-ness" or "units of". This would give "ten" as the older word from which "hundred" is derived, which makes sense culturally too 1In PIE a series of forms like *CéC, *CeC, *CóC, *CoC, *CC were related in a mechanism called ablaut which was used to express grammatical function. 2Although I note that *tom/tóm/tam is reconstructed as an accusative demonstrative or pronoun, e.g. in Schleicher's fable. 

This is the s sorda, o s aspra. Musulmano/mussulmano is given as an example in the wikipedia article. 

One thing to remember about English spelling is that for the most part it is "frozen", and reflects the Middle English pronunciation. Another thing to remember is that there has never been a standardized spelling for English, and individual judgment, errors, and a variety of dialects have played a large role in how words are spelled. So every question about English spelling has to be considered in light of these two major issues. Night, fight, and wight are all pronounced with a final /-aɪt/ in Modern English. Their < -ght > spelling reflects the Middle English pronunciations, which had a final /-ixt/. (The digraph < gh > in MidEng represented the sounds /x/ or /ç/, which were also variously spelled < h >, < ch >, < ȝ >.) The reason the three words are spelled similarly in Modern English is that they rhymed in Middle English. The reason they rhymed in Middle English despite differing etymologies is that they underwent regular predictable phonological mergers: 

I have seen claims that some dialects of German [PDF] have conjunctions that exhibit agreement morphology, e.g. the remarkable second-person-singular subordinating conjuction daßst in: 

Wikipedia has a chart showing the Hebrew (and other) alphabets and the theorized relation to Egyptian hieroglyphs. Evidently the Proto-sinaitic script is conjectured to be intermediate between the hieroglyphs and later true alphabets, basing most of its letterforms off of equivalent hieroglyphs according to acrophony. But it's not clear to me that this link between the hieroglyphs and the Proto-sinaitic script is well-established. 

As @jlovegren said, this is not an uncommon situation, especially in parts of the world that did not have a long history of literacy. Take for instance Senegal as an example. The majority L1's in Senegal are Wolof and Puulaar, and a wide variety of other L1's are also spoken. Literacy in Puulaar is 10-30%, and is even lower in Wolof. But the languages of instruction are French and Arabic (M Fall, 2011): 

I'll concentrate on the historical part of your question as others are doing well on the modern work. As you've suspected from the etymology, the term δίφθογγος is Ancient Greek (diphthongos, borrowed into LL as diphthongus) and was already in broad use by the 2nd century CE - e.g., Terentianus writes: 

University of Minnesota Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition maintains a very complete bibliography on speech acts in a variety of languages. It's not clear from your question whether you are interested in English only; there is a lot of Japanese work listed as well. Here is the page on Thanking acts. It includes: Coulmas, F. (1981). Eisenstein, M. & Bodman, J. (1995). Eisenstein, M. & Bodman, J. W. (1986). Ferrara, K. (1994). Hinkel, E. (1994). Ide, R. (1998). Kim, Y. (1994). Kimura, K. (1994). Kumatoridani, T. (1999). Miyake, K. (1994). Moriyama, T. (1999). Nakata, T. (1989). Ogawa, H. (1995). So it's certainly a good place to start. 

‘lacking or without 2’ ‘lacking or without 1’ Some sources give 18 as not subtractive, but others have 18 as subtractive: ‘11+7’ ‘10+lacking 2’ 

My thinking on this is as follows. Whispering in regular languages isn't usually semantically or phonemically salient. It's almost always just a modulation of speech in compensation for the physical or social environment. For this reason it's not transcribed in phonetic notation, just like shouting is usually not transcribed. Sometimes whispering can be phonetically salient, though. This is rarely if ever the case as part of a language's sound system, so there hasn't been any need to notate it much. Now, whispering is definitely phonetically salient is in the study of speech disorders. Dysphonation of various types is found among those with disordered speech. This includes inappropriate whispered, creaky, faucalized, unvoiced, mouthed, etc. phonations, ingressive airstreams, etc. Fascinatingly, though the Extensions to the IPA[PDF] do not actually include a mechanism for indicating whispered phonation! Wikipedia says they do, but it's not clear to me that this is actually true. The IPA does include a variety of diacritics for phonation types, but whisper is not included. 

PIE *-ti -> PGmc *-di/-ði -> AS -t/-ð/-þ -> ME -th (Southern)/ -s (Northern) -> ModE -s The Northern -s came from the influence of Norse mediopassive -sk; eventually the Northern usage became standard in Modern English. According to this, the form has been inflectional at least back to late PIE. 

This is adverbial or adpositional phrase order, and it is indeed a typological syntax feature, often correlated with other word order types. It describes an ordering choice of adjectives/adverbs/adpositional phrases categorized as referring to time (when, e.g. 'now'), place (where, e.g. 'here'), and manner (how, e.g. 'quickly'). Two predominant orderings are time-manner-place and place-manner-time. Other orderings are possible. time–manner–place is often correlated with SOV (e.g. german, japanese) 

WALS refers to these as core cases. Specifically, for nominative-accusative aligned languages, these are nominative and accusative; for ergative languages, the core cases are ergative-absolutive. 

The fivefold division seems to be old, widespread and established, but not universal. See Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights, 2nd century CE: 

I do not know much more about this, nor what dialects they are, except for a mention that they are Austrian. To be sure, these conjunctions exhibit only person-marking, not case-marking. 

*dékm was an e-grade form with a zero-grade form *dkm1. *-tóm was a suffix. Neither source conjectures as to its nature2. The initial d of *dkmtóm was lost, presumably for phonotactic reasons as happened with *dʰ(é)ǵʰōm. 

Other examples abound, although I don't want to just give a long list. One salient example is the affrication which accompanied palatalization in Romance. In various environments in various languages this took the various forms: 

Regarding Romanian's history: it's a member of the Eastern Romance (sensu strictu) subfamily or the "Vlach" languages. The peculiarities of Romanian are shared by its sisters in that branch such as Aromanian in Greece, Macedonia, Albania; Megleno-romanian in Greece, Macedonia, and Turkey; and Istrian in, well, Istria. Their peculiar history was influenced by at least 4 distinct factors: 

(Note there there is also Pokorny Etymon *sneigu̯h- 'to snow; snow' > Eng snow L nivis 'snow' OCS снѣгѵ snĕgŭ 'snow' Gk νῐφάς niphas 'snow, flake' Pra 'siṇeha' 'snow' which is apparently unrelated, although I suppose it could be.) 

Gabriel in On Focus, Prosody, and Word Order in Argentinian Spanish [PDF] did follow-on work to Zubizarreta which does look at the cross-dialectal question. The most relevant quote from his paper is: 

This chart at Wikipedia gives an overview of the consonant changes of Low German compared to other West Germanic languages and may be helpful to you. 

As I understand it this is an evolution from the PIE reflexive to a new mediopassive. PIE is often reconstructed as having two voices, active and mediopassive. Classical Latin had separate verb forms in -r that marked the mediopassive. (This -r form was also found throughout Italoceltic, Tocharian, and Hittite.) Separately, PIE *se- -> Classical Latin sē (sēsē, sibi, suī) was almost purely a reflexive marker, with some use as a reciprocal marker (e.g. inter sē). As the Romance languages developed, the -r mediopassive became disused even for deponent verbs. I'm not confident why this happened; perhaps it was due to forms becoming homophonous. Anyway, with the loss of the old mediopassive a new form was adopted for the voice. The reflexive sē filled this role. In the daughter languages sē -> Fr, Es, Pt, Ro se, It si. So in Portuguese, and many of the other Romance languages, the reflexive/reciprocal and mediopassive are formed using se. The "subject indetermination" and "passiving" functions you describe use se as part of this new "mediopassive"; i.e., indeterminate or impersonal subjects regarded as a middle voice. EDIT: Miller (2010) has a treatment of this question in "The Mediopassive: Latin to Romance": 

On the free software side you may want to look at the plethora of tools available from The Semantic Software Lab at Concordia University. If you are interested in commercial work in this area, take a look at Using Discourse Commitments to Recognize Textual Entailment or A Discourse Commitment-Based Framework for Recognizing Textual Entailment as references, and the (commercial) software tools from Language Computer Corp. They have demos of some of their tools. I have not used these tools. 

Omniglot (which I highly recommend) lists a number of "semanto-phonetic" writing systems including modern Chinese and Japanese. Most of these are ideographic or logographic in nature, though. I think the closest you may come to the literal description in your question is shorthand, systems of tachygraphy for various languages. One modern example is Pitman Shorthand for English, consiting of symbols including the following 

A similar situation exists with Bahasa Indonesia, the standardized official version of the Malay language in Indonesia. 23,000,000 speak it as an L1, but over 120,000,000 as an L2. Bahasa Indonesia is the primary language of instruction, and there is wide literacy in that language. So, there are many people who speak their native language orally but who can read and write Bahasa Indonesia. 

Not surprisingly I suppose, this has indeed been studied. Guiora, Beit-Hallahmi, Brannon, Dull, and Scovel in "The Effects of Experimentally Induced Changes in Ego States on Pronunciation Ability in a Second Language: An Exploratory Study"l [PDF] give a somewhat tongue-in-cheek but nevertheless thoroughly scholarly exploration. Their conclusion is that drinking alcohol induces a state of empathy with speakers of L2, which in turn leads to improved pronunciation of L2. The proposed mechanism according to Hudson and Bruckman [PDF] is thus: 

This situation obtained in Latin due to a transition in word order from earlier left-branching (head-final) to later right-branching (head-initial). The related Italic languages Oscan and especially Umbrian had many more postpositions than Latin, for example. This supports jogloran's point in his answer that the head parameter of a language dictates whether it has post- or pre-positions; only during transitions will you find both. Of course, languages are always in transition :) 

Ubykh evidently contrasts alveolo-palatal /ɕ/, /ɕʷ/, velar /x/, uvular /χʲ/, /χ/, /χʷ/, /χˤ/, /χˤʷ/, and glottal /h/ - four places of articulation and four secondary articulation (labialized, palatalized, pharyngealized, and labialized/pharyngealized). This is not exactly what you asked as it has an alveo-palatal /ɕ/ instead of a pure palatal /ç/, but you might consider it close. It is impressive; luckily it only has 2 phonemic vowels.
