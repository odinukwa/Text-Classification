At my company we are required to put in our time. If we don't, we don't get paid. That is a pretty simple incentive. I would also look into time tracking software(specifically for construction companies). Construction specific time keeping software will force the user to put time onto specific jobs, cost codes and categories. For example, an employee would be required to select which job they are entering time for(say "West High School") and the cost code on that job ("Painting Gym"). Cloud based solutions are nice because then an employee can put time in anywhere and you will be able to see, approve it. I think it is fair to require employee to use time tracking software. If you were to get audited it would be very hard to prove how much time you spent where. A paper trail(the software)would make it easy to show your records of what you have been doing. 

You have to let people live their lives. Many of us think we know what's best for everyone else. Even if that were true(it's not), it doesn't matter because people have to make their choices. That being said, if you are determined to talk your friend out of their job: Listen! As a friend ask them about the good parts and bad parts of the job. Without giving advice just listen. Ask them about long term plans. Ask them if they want to be the same job in a few years. Maybe they are scared of finding a new job, maybe they really need the insurance. It's impossible to know. By listening you can find the "heart of the matter" and help resolve that issue instead. People aren't just going to do thing because you want them. To make a drastic change in their life, they have to want to do it too. 

I would proceed with caution and look out for you. I would say you should consider not giving a two weeks notice. I am not saying I recommend it, but it's worth considering depending on the situation. Your mileage may vary. At my last job I was certain of the same situation when I was leaving. I tried to be professional and give 2 weeks. Sure enough it was hell, and then my boss excused me just a couple days refusing to pay me for the remaining time on my contract. I had already given the start date at my new job so I was out of almost 2 weeks salary. If I could go back, I wouldn't have given a notice. My boss was a spiteful person so there was no way they were ever going to be a positive reference anyway. So you have to ask yourself : What do I have to gain/lose by giving notice? 

Short answer: Take accountability and try to improve. Long answer: Taking accountability is the first major step when you make a mistake. Good co-workers will appreciate that you are honest with yourself and your mistakes. If you show you are willing to learn, people will be a lot more willing to keep you around. I would also examine your processes. Why do the same mistakes keep having over and over again? Perhaps you need to add an extra step in whatever you do, a "testing phase" or "quality assurance phase". I think it would be worthwhile if you could slow down and improve quality. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. Realize that you are an intern, and everyone makes mistakes. Try to stay positive and work hard to improve yourself. Every employee goes through rough times. The true measure of strength is working through times of adversity. 

Any feelings of loyalty are probably not reciprocated by your company. They pay you so little because either they don't think you are worth more or they can't afford to. In either case, I would consider moving on. Staying may harm your career more than leaving. I don't think leaving this job is especially dangerous but in your case I would say be prepared to stick out your next job for a couple of years. Software Engineers are high in demand. If you are good, companies will risk that you may leave within a year of two of getting hired. 

I have recently started a new job. I have struggled to gain friendships here as I feel there is an established clique. I am frustrated with how much I am left out. The team lead and his best buds go out to lunch often, and I am often the odd man out. They are all on group e-mail chains, which I over hear about constantly sending each other funny thing back and forth. They often have impromptu meetings without me making design decisions. I want to be friends with these people. But if that can't happen I at least want to be involved in the work aspect of things. It's difficult because I feel the two are somewhat connected. I am one of the senior devs on the team. I am not an intern. I am very much apart of the same projects these people are on. I should be involved in discussions. It's hard to feel excited about working here anymore. My manager(their boss and my boss) is oblivious to the situation. I am sure as he has other things he is working on and worried about. How can I ask to be included without sounding petty? 

How can I leave without damaging my career? Be professional, give notice(two weeks) and realize two things: 

United States Software Engineer here. Can my employer legally make me sign something that says they own any code I may write(including at home)? I know they can terminate me at anytime for any reason. My question is: is such a agreement even valid? They allow you do to stuff in the side but it all has to be pre approved by management. To me, best case is that it is legal but really annoying. 

You don't even have to explain that you aren't currently paid. I would keep that out of it. If potential employers ask you how much you are currently making - redirect the question. 

From $URL$ There are a number of other states with similar laws. I've compiled a list of states that have laws restricting what IP employers can claim ownership of: California* - Cal. Lab. Code 2870-72 Delaware - Del. Code Ann. tit. 19 805 Illinois - 765 Ill. Comp. Stat 1060/2 Kansas - Kan. Stat. Ann. 44-130 Minnesota - Minn. Stat. 181.78 North Carolina - N.C. Gen. Stat. 66-57.1-.2 Washington - Wash. Rev. Code Ann. 49.44.140, .150 Utah - Utah Code Title 34 Chapter 39 The California statute also requires an employer to inform employees about the law. Note that the laws that govern your employment contract are usually based on the state in which you work, not the state the company is incorporated in. And, as always, if you have questions about your employment contract, have a lawyer help you understand it and how it applies to state law. Also, this list may not be comprehensive. If you know of any other states, please add a comment and I'll update the answer. 

I am a software developer for a large organization (10,000+ employees). It seems often(perhaps intentionally)unpopular policies are made from top level executives. The policies mostly effect us employees on the "ground floor". Through middle management, we learn of these policies with the anecdote "our hands our tied, we didn't decide this". The accountability breaks down because the executives never have to see the people their policies are affecting. Middle managers want to look like team players so they don't relay frustrations with the policy to the executives. What are some strategies a low level employee can implement to institute change? 

Being in the same situation myself, this is what I have decided to do - it may work for you. 1) Keep the request for a raise and a potential job search completely separate. I would go to your boss before you have started interviewing or get an offer. Be positive-mention you really want to continue working for your current company. Something like "I really want to stay here, and I think this company can help me reach some of my personal and career goals". Part of this is money, you don't have to say it, I think it's implied. You can continue on "Because of Y and Z I feel like I deserve a X% raise". See where the conversation takes you. You can approach boss being honest that at that point, you have no job offer. You can say you aren't looking(but you may casually mention you are being sought out if you think it will help). This way your boss won't feel "threatened" or put in a corner. You may be able to get what you want without ever interviewing anywhere. 2) Before you have an offer, try to avoid the "I could get $X somewhere else". Focus on the "I should get $X here because of Y and Z". Some managers may respond negatively to an ultimatum "Give me $X or I am leaving". Again, keep it positive. 3) Decide what you really want - Would you be happy with 90k/year or is it 100k/year or bust? A 20k/year raise is unlikely. They will probably meet you in the middle. You have to decide at which point you'd be content. 4) If they say no then proceed interviewing other places. You have given your employer a chance to show you what they think you are worth. Now is your chance to prove it. If you don't get any offers, you won't have to save face because you told your boss you could get $X somewhere else. If you do get an offer(make sure it is in hand)-This will give your some leverage in the negotiations. You do not necessarily have to tell your boss about the offer but have the peace of mind that you can be bold. If you are not really willing to leave I would not bring the offer up. But if you are willing to leave, but would rather stay-still try to keep it positive "I have this offer for $X, I don't want to take it. I would rather stay here. Can you do something to help me stay here?" You aren't forcing your boss to act, but empowering him to do so. Again, decide, if staying is the goal: give your employer every chance to make it possible without damaging your relationship. If making money is your goal-interview and take the most attractive offer. 

1) Use 'Do Not Disturb' - If there is an IM system, don't be afraid to use the 'Do Not Disturb'. Perhaps make it a practice in your company to check before going to talk to someone if they are available. Maybe put up a sign indicating you are busy. Perhaps headphones could also be an indicator to not disturb someone. 2) Use priorities as an excuse - If someone still interrupts you, and you are working on something time sensitive, just say, "I am sorry I am working in a high priority issue right now". Be direct, but polite. If your boss assigns you tasks, he should be okay with you doing this if you are focusing on the things that are most important. 3) Log interruptions - Keep track of these interruptions. In my company, the standard is if we spend 15+ minutes on an unexpected issue to log it and keep track of who you were helping. There may be someone who recieves way too much help and isn't learning. This is a way to keep track of that. 4) Time box responses - At my company, any time I log should be spent on issue I have been assigned. If someone asks me a question to troubleshoot something that will take more than a few minutes I use the following. "I can help for {x} minutes, but I am afraid I don't have more time allocated for that right now. If it is a issue that is serious we should log it into our system and my manager will see I can work on it when approriate." If it is high priority, it will be sooner rather than later. A problem, that may still exists, is losing that "train of thought". Without you manager's help enforcing the above suggestions, you will have to be flexible. Do what you can without over stepping your bounds.
