As an experienced cyclist with a little tandem experience: yes, it is feasible. It takes some adjusting though. It's worth riding the thing by yourself to a get a feel for it's geometry, gears, brakes and starting and stopping before adding the stoker. Everybody gotta start sometime! But it does depend on having a head for cycling. I have seen fairly experienced cyclists who struggled. Everything gets easier with a more experienced stoker too. I would add ... It is important to agree on verbal and non-verbal signals, especially for starting and stopping. If my four year old daughter kept pedaling it was really hard to stop at traffic lights! (Yes, she was (and is) quite strong). 

There are two things about these rides. They show that I'm just a cyclist of modest abilities, so such comparisons should be relevant to you and many others. They also show the effect of continuous climbing, the effect of steeper hills, and the effect of longer duration, all tangled together. It's complicated. 

It's complicated, and this may not be all there is to it. From my reading of part 2 of the UCI WorldTour regulations (p43-44) is 

(Set it up properly with the seat at the correct height and angle). When my daughter was riding the trailer-bike I had to tell her to stop pedaling, otherwise I could not stop at traffic lights :-) I used to take my daughter to kindergarten using the bike seat and later the trailer-bike. At the kinder I was lucky that I found a place I could leave them safely so that I could continue my commute unencumbered. 

You already have some good, helpful answers. Well done for sticking at that hill! Make sure you're riding on slick tires, and have them pumped up pretty hard. Soft, wide tires would rob much of your effort. Regarding the hill. There are several things involved in sustained climbing 

I currently ride on Rubino Pro Slick tires, and have used various Vittoria tires for decades. The Vittoria Rubino tires you are using have similar wet grip to what I use (dry grip will be the same). The pressures you quote are good. I get the impression that both incidents occurred in the same corner. If that is the case then I would strongly suspect oil on the road. When cornering with under inflated tires, they give a characteristic sickening lurch to the side, usually accompanied by a scrubbing noise, and then they let go. This kind of crash can rob your confidence. Just take it easy, be extremely careful on that corner (or avoid it), and get well soon. 

Go to Google Maps at $URL$ Select Directions. Type your starting address. Type your destination. Click "..." to the left of the Directions icon, then click the bicycling icon. Customize the route by dragging the blue line (your bike route) wherever 

I've followed these guidelines for the past six years without incident, on an asphalt-grey bike with black fenders, and without wearing any bright clothing (not that brighter clothing is unnecessary - just not my style). 

I also use a Joe Blow on my prestas. After I had a couple valve stems bend and/or break, I started making sure I only unscrew the stem a little bit. My theory was that by unscrewing the stem all the way up, it was easier to bend or break when pulling the pump head off. Haven't had it happen again since. 

I know you're looking for a different answer, and I'm not trying to be preachy, either. This just touches on a subject that's been on my mind a lot lately. There's no fool-proof way to get pedestrians to move out of your way. No matter how loud your yell/bell/horn/brake noise is, there will always be a chance that someone won't react as you predict. Just like vehicles on the road have an obligation to maneuver safely around us cyclists, we have an obligation to do the same with pedestrians. It's not the pedestrian's job to get out of your way. If you don't want to deal with pedestrians on MUPs, ride on the road or a cycling-specific path. But if you're going to share a MUP with pedestrians, you have to slow down when passing if you can't get them to move over safely, period. The minor inconvenience you'll face is worth not injuring yourself and/or others. Not to mention how much better the working relationship between motorists, we cyclists, and pedestrians could be if we all practice what we preach to drivers. 

Clarification: I am not asking for a solution to punctures, or about the nuances of ride quality with the various solutions. I am asking whether one method of reducing punctures has been proven better than others through scientific testing. Preface: I often see people online using tubes with sealant rather than tire liners or puncture resistant tires, and wonder "why?" The slime is messy, can clog the valve, weighs more than liners, and does nothing to actually prevent a puncture, but rather waits until the puncture occurs to go into action filling it and (hopefully) coagulating in the hole. I've read that this really only works on small holes, too. Purely anecdotal evidence: I've ridden for the last eight years on the same route during my commute. I started with tire liners on regular tires, then went with Continental Gatorskins (Kevlar belted), and am now on my second set of Vittoria Randonneurs (double-shielded), and of the three setups, only ever had punctures on the Conti's -- at least two flats per year (grrr!). Zero flats on the Randos in nearly four years while laughing my way through the fields of glass. I see Schwalbe Marathons recommended more than any other brand, and while many say they've never had a flat with them, I also see some cyclists posting that they've had flats with those, too. It just seems to me that there's no competition: double-shielding wins, IMO. It's less hassle that liners or sealant, and just as protective as liners/more protective than sealant, and generally weigh the same or less than sealant-filled tubes or tire-liners. Not to mention the cost factor over time. Question: Can someone explain the advantages of using liners or sealant over puncture-resistant tires, specifically relating to resisting punctures? Have any scientific studies been done to compare the three methods? 

I have thought about few questions to ask to the shop keeper before buying a bike. But would like to know from you experts, a complete set of questions like warranty period? Number of free services offered after sales?...etc. 

I am planning to buy a bicycle (either or ). I personally prefer road-bike. I have to travel on broken tar to reach a smooth tar road. On an average I will cycle 200 km per week out of which 15% will be on broken tar (rugged road) with ups and downs. If I buy a road-bike, it will be this. I know the purpose of the road-bikes and the MTBs. Is it advisable to buy a road-bike given this condition? My main question is, will the road-bikes do good for 30 km, in a week, on rugged road? If not, what will happen to the bike? Can anyone please suggest? Also please let me know if you want more details on the question. 

For the past few months, I have been thinking about clipless pedals. I am mostly a long distance rider. I go for the randonneuring and long distance triathlons. From various sources, I am informed that I can increase speed wearing clipless pedals but not ride long distances like 600 km or 1000 km. These are not expert sources. I want to hear from experts. Can you please tell me if I can go for clipless shoes and pedals for long distances? 

I am going to buy a bike and ride upto 1000 km or more in a month. Adding them, I think it will come to 12 k to 15 k per year on an average. I will be riding on highways, so there won't be any off-roads. Nevertheless, the roads in my country are not well maintained. Let us consider that initially the bike is comfortable and everything fine at the time of purchase. What are the different problems (repairs & maintenance) that occur? Among those which ones will cost me and which ones will be free of cost. Also if it is possible, answer them with 'high, medium, low' cost of maintenance. 

I have got a new set of clipless pedals and shoes. Hardly used it for some 15 rides. Whenever I use it I feel a pain on my left foot's 5th Metatarcel and Cuboid bones. There is no pain whatsoever on the right foot. I am using this pedals and this pair of shoes. On the right set, The shoe is tightly set to the pedals after locking, that is, there is no lateral swivelling of my foot while riding. But on the left side, my foot slightly swivels laterally. Could this be the reason? Please let me know, if you had any similar pain and how you controlled it...
