First, congratulations on recognizing a potential problem, and starting to take steps about it while you are still young. Building a lifetime of fitness habits is much easier to do starting at your age. A few things that I would point out that may help. As others have stated, muscle weighs more than fat, so if you swap out the same amount of fat mass for muscle mass, overall you will weigh more. For the fitness and eating, there are a few red flags, which I'll outline. 

Unless you're doing specialty stuff, what the big box stores have should be sufficient. I would also add REI Outdoor to your list. As far as fit, I always like them to fit fairly snug, almost like ski boots. Make sure that they are consistently snug, it's no good to have your ankles flopping around while your calves are being choked. (My wife has that problem, she can't find ones that fit due to small feet and large calves from Irish Dance). 

Rolling the neck is contraindicated because it can hyperextend and compress the cervical vertebrae and cause nerve damage over time. You can let your chin just kind of hang your your chest, and lean your head to the side (Think touching your ear to your shoulder) as recommended neck stretches. As you advance, you can add a gentle traction to the side stretch. (So if you are leaning your head to the right, you can place the palm of your right hand on the high curve of the head and gently apply a pulling, not a downward, pressure. Be aware and stop at any discomfort). You can also look to the right and left as if you were trying to look behind you without moving your shoulders. These should all provide a stretch to the muscles in the neck/jaw/upper shoulders (Of which the sternocleidomastoid will be the primary recipient). 

This evening I did a low intensity run (10km - 46'), a very easy workout based on my standard. Tomorrow morning (about 12-13h after the run) I should do the blood test.. There is the possibilities to get an altered result due to this workout few hour before the withdrawal or not? If yes, should I wait until the day after tomorrow? I will do these exams: 

Let's assume I switch to Insanity, I can run/MTB/Trekking as well as doing the daily workout? (not every day, and not stressful exercises) UPDATE I like the weight I am (last time I checked (september) I had 5.5% body fat), I would like to get a better body definition and, as I said, improve my endurance/speed etc Said so, acutally I did not have a particular diet, although I did it in in the past. My regular routine is: eat 5 times a day, breakfast/morning meal/lunch/afternoon meal/dinner, drink about 1lt water in the morning, 1lt water in the afternoon and 1/2lt tea/water in the evening I live in italy, I have a well rounded diet, I eat everything and especially a lot of vegetables... I don't mind to write the entire diet but I do not want to be lengthy... I think that the main problem, for me, to completly follow a program like Insanity or P90X is to strictly abide the diet, I live with other people and it could be difficult to manage a particular diet routine, sometimes they just cook something and having a different meal isn't a possibility... 

Do you prefer Insanity or P90X? Do you suggest to continue running instead of Insanity? Switching from running to Insanity/P90X workout could give a benefits or rather than that worsen my "running" form? (speaking of endurance/speed/etc) 

There could be quite a few different causes, from internal to environmental. My first thought is EIB (Exercise Induced Bronchospasm), which used to be called exercise induced asthma. It can be mild to serious. Other than that, a pulmonologist or other expert should probably be consulted, to rule out anything physical. 

Basically, your body will start shutting down external systems (muscle control, digestion, etc) to preserve glucose to keep the brain ticking over. For a good example of this, look at the video of Gabriela Andersen-Scheiss (Then Gabriela Andersen) at the Olympic marathon in 1984. You can see that over the last lap, she has little control and keeps wandering around, collapsing, and barely making progress. You can also see it in the women's Ironman finish from 1997, with Sian Welch and Wendy Ingraham. This was fatigue, muscle cramping and hypoglycemia. Eventually, if you keep exercising in that state, your body will shut down, and in extreme cases it can lead to death. 

Breaststroke timing is one of the funkier things to get down, and I would suggest watching youtube videos of Olympic and World meets, as they will have some underwater shots of top level swimmers. There are also excellent instructional videos. For the streamline off the wall, ideally you want the arms straight out "overhead", with the hands flat on one another (Palm to the back of the other hand), with your head in front of the arms, not between them. This will last until you take your first underwater pull, then they will be momentarily by your side until you start your full stroke. For the timing, when I used to teach to beginners, I described it as drawing an upside down heart (Hands out in front start what would normally be the pointy bottom in a valentine style heart), the pull "draws" the heart, and then the recovery "cuts it up the middle". The legs should start flexing and coming up towards the body somewhere on the outer arc of the "heart" before it starts to curve into the middle with the hands, and then you kick at about the same time you "cut" the heart and shove your hands forward. If you wait until the arms are fully extended, you lose some of the propulsion, and you also work against yourself when you push the arms out. You do a little even if you extend while kicking, but it's minimized in that instance. Personally, since I swam competitively for so long, even my lazy stroke and ones where I keep my head out follow this same timing. It's uncomfortable for me to swim with my head out, so I'll almost always get at least half my face in the water during the stroke. Practice, watch the videos, and if you have a lot of problems, there is no substitute for someone actually looking at your stroke, see if there are instructors in your area.
