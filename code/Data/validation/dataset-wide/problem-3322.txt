The German Wikipedia-article on semantic nets lists more relations: additionally to the above three relations, four further are enumerated: 

When I try to read an article related to India (in particular indo-aryan languages) certain special characters emerge which I do not know how to pronounciate. For instance: Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini contains ṣ,ṭ,ṇ - but there are more. I have tried to look them up in the IPA-list, but no such characters exist there. 

Sprachgesetze, verbatimally laws of language, are stochastic statements about features of a language based on empirical evaluation of a corpus. The Sprachgesetze I found are mainly quantitative statements about features on syntactic (piotrowki-law) or lexical level. Do you know of any Sprachgesetz concerning semantics? 

Wikipedia tells about the difference and relation between lexical aspect and grammatical aspect. Whereas the lexical aspect is a specific way to put focus onto how to observe an event on a semantic level, the grammatical aspect is its concrete realization either by means of syntax or morphology. My question aims to the following: Since each language has either syntactical, morphological or both ways of realizing an event, is it possible to express every lexical aspect by what choice of realization ever? for example: Is there a language that is not able to express the concept of inchoativeness or progressiveness? 

My command of the English language is quiet poor, I write by my feeling, and each sentence is just another chain element left behind not knowing how many Errors are within it. The feeling comes close to using roulette as a mean of communication. Since English puts more focus on Syntax than my native language (German), i might improve if i learn more about Syntax, especially about established Syntax patterns. As for now, i do not even know if there is simply a hand full of syntax patterns or a myriad. So here is what i know for sure from school: 

All 7 relations being described by having or not having features of reflexivity, transivity and symmetry. Is there a standard set or different sets of relations for semantic nets within linguistics? 

Now, I understand how to articulate an "alveolar trill" - you put the tip of your tongue onto the fleshy part above your upper teeth, air-pressure is accumulating behind it untill it is strong enough to push it open, once the air escapes the pressure falls and low-pressure causes the tongue close again and the cycle starts again. Not one cycle, but its repetition is what makes it a trill I can not make any sense with the term syllabic alveolar trill and how this relates to an alveolar trill. Question: Could You explain to me what exactly is happening with ones articulatory organs while such a sound is produced and what the difference to a regular alveolar trill is? 

American English Use subjunctive more than British English and also they heavily use modal verb "would". Grammatical moods like subjunctive in many European languages like German and Spanish are stronger than British English. So is it correct that non-British European immigrants influence modality and moods of American English? Edit: following is from The subjunctive in Present-Day English page 144: A number of possibilities are put forward by Övergaard as reasons for the return of the mandative subjunctive in AmE at the beginning of the twentieth century, all of them speculative and almost impossible to prove. These include the influence of the native languages of the large number of immigrants from north-European backgrounds and the importance of the Authorized Version of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer, in which subjunctive forms are prominent features. She points out that these books represent ‘practically the only English that all gentile immigrants . . . came in contact with’ (1995: 46). Regarding the increase in the mandative subjunctive in BrE between 1960 and 1990, Övergaard follows commentators such as Quirk et al. (1985: 157) and Gowers, in his edition of Fowler’s Modern English Usage (1965: 595), in ascribing it to the influence of AmE and the growth of mass media after the Second World War, as a result of which ‘American texts of every kind flooded Europe, and their impact on BrE evidently led to renewed availability of the non-inflected subjunctive, causing what appears to have been something of a sea change’ (1995: 51). In summary, Övergaard’s monograph is clearly a major contribution to the understanding of developments regarding the mandative subjunctive in BrE and AmE in the twentieth century. The evidence of the revival early in the century in AmE and the later revival in BrE is very strong. Yet certain things need to be borne in mind when referring to her findings... 

It seems that some syntacticians sometimes use the word subregularity instead of irregularity. Is there any difference between these two terms or they cover same concept? 

It seems that in context of French grammar (at least in traditional grammar) talking about stative and dynamic verbs is not relevant. because there is no real progressive aspect in french and there is a tense like imperfect which we can use it for permanent or progressive situations for both stative and dynamic verbs. so syntactically it is not necessary to talk about stative and dynamic verbs in practice. so syntax and morphology of French is not much sensetive to stative and dynamic verbs. and traditional grammar is actually syntax and morphology. I am not expert in French grammar. Do you know any cases in French grammar which for explanation of syntactical or morphological behaviors something was said about the concept of stative and dynamic verbs?
