The Chinese minority in Indonesia is the first supporting example that comes to mind. However worldwide it is far more common for oppressed ethnic minorities to be relatively poor due to the legal and social barriers they have to deal with. I love Neal Stevenson's work (particularly the Baroque Cycle), but like many authors he's got his annoying quirks. In this case he's made the classic error of believing the plural of anecdote is "data". 

As this was the height of the Middle Ages, our sources for these kinds of things quite frankly stink. The legend about King Richard seems to come from a "ballad-chronicle". They were sort of the lowbrow popular equivalent to the Romantic Epic. These were stories sung by bards chiefly for the purpose of entertainment. The accurate recounting of historical events to posterity was not a primary consideration. For instance, all our Arthurian stories about Sir Lancelot seem to have been wholly invented by the tellers of these same kinds of romantic epics (likely in an effort to interest French listeners). The man is simply not to be found in any earlier records. According to (interestingly enough) Charles Dickens, who did a study on Cannabalisim, the story (legend) here wasn't that King Richard set out to do it, but that he ended up in a situation where it was thought he had to. 

I was able to dig up one source with an explanation. It relates to your information about that being a common suffix for Japanese ships. Bruce Gamble in Target: Rabul asserts that it was originally a name of derision applied (I'm assuming by crews of other ships) due to her knack for managing to be indisposed during major battles with the Japanese. 

Note that none of this is my own research, but rather a compilation of others' I found at the following places: 

Good editor. I wouldn't have thought to challenge that, but its true that numbers weren't exactly Du Bois' thing. Not saying he wasn't good with them, just that isn't what he's famous for, or spent most of his time dealing with. In fact, the actual source of that quote appears to be Harold Geneen, an accountant by training who retired as CEO of ITT. Wikiquote sources this statement from his book Managing, Chapter Nine (The Numbers), p. 151. 

Number 1 frankly anybody could offer. However, Russia had interest in the same area. Number 2 implies both would have to be at war with Russia. France could certianly offer some of Number 3, no matter how the alliances end up shaking out. However, their opponents could as well (particularly French Indochina). Also, #3 would be quite difficult for Japan to pull off if the British navy was opposed to the idea (which is why Japan and England had a naval alliance at the time). So to make #3 viable, France and Japan would probably have to be also allied with England, and going up against Germany and the Netherlands or against the USA (Phillipines). So most likely an alliance with Japan would require (and be most useful) in a situation where Russia is on the other side. In a pinch, you could convince them to go for the southern expansion option, but in that case it would only be feasible if Germany and the Netherlands are on the other side, or the USA is on the other side. 

(You could make various cases for various blips, but the overall trend is clearly a turn-around of the previous downward trend into an upward trend) 

* - Most likely this is because he was found not guilty, so he's quite happy to talk about his victory to anyone who will listen. People found guilty don't appear to be quite so ebullient about it. 

There were some times Nepal was partially conquered. Most were during the early medieval period. Documentation during this period can be problematic, but there are records of the Muraya Empire claiming the southern part of the country in the 3rd Century BCE, the Chalukya's managing to get Hindus installed as kings in the 6th CE, and the Tibetian Empire ruling large parts of the area in the late 8th. In general, if a country is not invaded, it means that there are no resources worth having that are deemed worth the trouble it would be to take over. The particular war you mentioned with the British is a good example of the principle. The BEI had started to lose money on their Indian empire once the price for its cotton exports dropped. Nepal's (at the time) western provinces were thought to produce some of the world's highest-quality wool, so the British invaded to take them. They largely succeeded, which is why those provinces to this day are part of India rather than Nepal (to be fair, the Nepalese had only controlled those provinces for about a generation). They didn't bother taking the rest of Nepal because the western provinces were already very expensive to take, and they had no use for the rest of Nepal. 

The answer has to be no, because there was wasn't solid evidence that it happened at all, until recent genetic tests essentially proved it. There were rumors, and his own suspicious behavior, but that's all we had. However, there is one thing that is pretty clear: no matter what her feelings were on the matter, as an enslaved person, Hemmings was in no position to say "no". Withholding consent was not an option for her. That by itself makes the relationship rape, in the same way that a grown person having sex with a minor or mentally handicapped person is automatically considered rape. 

What you are referring to is commonly known as the "French Column". I suppose it shouldn't be surprising that English movies and the English version of Wikipedia are pretty dismissive of it. After all, that was the opinion of everyone's favorite English General, Wellington. And he was certainly able to back it up. The first thing you have to realize is that Napoleonic-era unit tactics were not all about math. Getting the maximum possible fire on your opponent is important, but it isn't the only factor. The greatest goal is to remove the enemy units from action. Now a unit (regiment, battalion, etc) obviously can be removed from action without killing every single person in that unit. How bad do you have to hurt them? That depends on oodles of factors (eg: training, experience, casualties, etc) that are often wound up into a big ball called "morale". So a lot of Napoleanic-era tactics that may not make a lot of sense mathematically make a lot of sense when you factor in morale. For instance, the volley. Mathematically you'd be better off letting every man fire as fast as he possibly can, rather than making them all wait on a signal. However, there's a huge difference to the opposing unit whether your buddies around you are dying in dribs and drabs here and there, or in great big groups all at once. Volleys hit like a hammer rather than a steady rain. The idea behind a French Column isn't to pour a lot of fire into the opposing unit. Instead, it is to concentrate the entire efforts of your unit into a small area (usually in the middle) of the enemy unit. The folks in the rest of the enemy unit may feel safer, but anyone at the point of impact looking at an entire French Column 50 or so men wide and hundreds deep making a beeline straight at their part of the line has a pretty good idea they are gonna die. A sensible human being (aka: all but the incredibly well-trained) looking at that will do whatever they can to get out of the way. If you can break the enemy line there, you break their unit in two. If you then keep coming, you will suddenly have your whole unit in the middle of theirs, able to fire on all of them effectively in a line while they have found themselves in a column (assuming they don't just rout). The key to being able to do this is training and speed, and early on nobody could match Napoleon in these two qualities. It was almost like a Calvary charge for him, but done with infantry. Here's a passage taken from a fan of the formation in Eric Flint's 1824: The Arkansas War (a work of alternative history): 

This is almost more of an economics question. The thing is, Oil prices at the time had a much more drastic effect on the US economy than the Soviet one, so you don't really have to look outside of US borders for reasons. Rising Oil prices were almost single-handedly responsible for getting Regan elected. When oil prices go up, the price of everything in the USA rises due to the vast distances involved in shipping things around our continent. This caused a never-before-noticed effect in the USA economy which they had to invent a new word for: stagflation. Normally unemployment and inflation vary inversely to each other. Eg: if a recession happens, people lose jobs, but inflation drops too. During an economic boom, the opposite happens. However, during the Carter administration there was a big Oil production slowdown, and the result was both inflation and unemployment got worse. The government didn't much know what to do about this, because their typical solution for one would make the other worse. Regan got elected because of this, so quite sensibly it was a very high priority of his to stop the Oil slowdown. USSR or no, he'd really like to be re-elected. I know there's a tendency now to grasp whatever straws available to paint Regan as the cunning genius who brought down the USSR. Having lived through it myself (and watched the guy's press conferences and speeches), I'll tell you it was much more like living through a live action Mr. Magoo cartoon. He may still deserve the credit, but the guy was just trying to drive his car... 

There's an archeological site called West Stow in England that attempts to reconstruct the Anglo-Saxon village found there around the 5-7th Century. That would probably qualify. There's another website covering it that has a lot more pictures of the buildings. It looks like the richer folks and their retainers lived together in "halls" that a lot of us are familiar with from Norse mythology, while the more humble folk tended to live it pit-houses (although there's an ongoing debate about how many pit-houses were just used for storage). The primary source of building materials there was wood, but that probably varied based on what materials were available locally. Outside of the Germanic areas, one would imagine the architecture might be a bit different. 

So bascially the Germans attacked because attacking France through Belgian territory was The Plan, and the Belgians refused to just let them walk through unopposed. 

The Technicolor folks, coming along a decade later as they did, would have been in a position to learn from the financial mistakes of their predecessors. In particular, it appears they put a priority in coming up with a system that didn't require all those expensive projectors: 

One of the first suggestions for electing the President was a direct vote. However, it was quickly and resoundingly rejected. The basic problem with having a popular vote was that it didn't take into account the differences in how how Southern society was organized compared to the rest of the country. In particular, slavery. In most states the only people who were allowed to vote were free male property owners. The problem there is that the society in the southern states (Virginia and parts south) was set up with a very small aristocratic land-owning elite, and nearly everyone else was a slave or worked for a plantation owner. The northern states had a lot more small family farms and businesses, and consequently far more eligible voters. So in a flat popular vote, these Southern states would be forced into an impossible choice of either accepting almost no say in who is elected President, or of giving the power of the vote to their slaves and hirelings. So some kind of other system was going to have to be used. Since a representational compromise had already been reached on the makeup of Congress, the easiest pull was to give each state one vote for every Congressman (Representative and Senator). The Constitutional Congress delegates knew they could pass a vote on that, because they'd just done so a few days before when they were deciding on the makeup of Congress. Of course this previous agreement included the notorious 3/5ths Compromise, where slave states were allowed, for the purposes of increasing the size of their delegation to the House of Representatives, to count 3/5ths of their slaves, who they had no intention of ever allowing to vote. Short answer: because slavery.
