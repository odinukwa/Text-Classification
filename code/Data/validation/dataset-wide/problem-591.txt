Riding 5 km each direction I mostly see one or two recumbent bikes or trikes each ride, at least 8 different regulars, which one I will see depends on my timing, on top of that comes my own, which I always see as I ride it every time. There are a few velomobiles in the area and I see one every once in a while, he seems to be using his daily. That might seem much for most of you. But I see between 30 and 60 bikes on a normal commute, more in summer when many tourists do the long distance route which runs on part of my normal commute. (I live in the Netherlands). About the costs? I had a new trike for less than €1000 about 9 years back and a second hand bike for €200 4 years back. I have spend a bit on either one, but on average less per year than one time car maintenance costs. I guess it is because recumbent bike and trikes are less well known and not the normal option for most people. Even my friends do not want to try out my bike/trike, or when they do 'just for fun.' But I see more 'bents now than when I first started riding one. (I am female and was over 40 when I got my trike.) As for why not more people try: Misguided ideas. Someone was claiming getting more wet on the 'bent. Wrong. Your upper body and legs get as wet, if in a different order. Depending on the quality of your rain gear, there is more front of body potentially getting wet when water does not run of properly, but your back is much better protected. Your legs get wet all over at once, rather than the dripping down and soaking along that wet trousers on an upright do. I guess racing position on a diamond frame protects the front of the legs a bit, on a longer wet ride they will still get soaked. The main advantage for a 'bent rider is that your feet do not get wet much or even at all. No run off from the legs at all. Your toes point upward, encouraging the rain to run off, not in and also not soaking into all those small nooks and crannies that shoes seem to have. And there is no way water splashing up from the street reaches you feet if you have a mid level or high 'bent. Even on a low racer the feet are quite well away from the splashing. Hard to ride? Changing from an upright to a 'bent trike did take about one minute to adjust. Changing from the 'bent trike to the 'bent bike took about half an hour, as the trike did not react at all on balance and had slow steering, the bike reacts very fast both on balance and on steering. People used to fast reacting sit-up bikes have less problems adjusting. Mostly it is not harder than adjusting to a new kind of sit-up or race position bike. And the most forgotten advantage. The seat options are so different that you will not have pain problems from them, even when you always suffer on a bike. And there are so many options that even when one does not suit you, there is bound to be an other one that does suit you or allows you to use it with adjustments. Also the different seat positions all allow you not to put any weight on your arms, which is a big pro for those who suffer from sore hands and arms while riding. 

Mentioned in the comments and in one line in an answer, it is overly ignored. Recumbent bikes or trikes might be the solution. There is no weight on your hands at all, there is less weight on your behind which is a big step further than sitting up bikes. Recumbents come in many different styles, from slow and comfy, can not fall off trikes to super fast racers, both as bikes and as trikes. It takes a bit of adjusting, mentally, to switch to a recumbent. Learning to ride one is mostly easy, a few minutes in a safe area, like an empty parking lot and a few days taking it easy when starting from stand. For those people who fall because they are easily spooked or because they have a very poor sense of balance, trikes are available. Almost impossible to fall off one of those, they can even be outfitted with safety belts. And do not think a trike has to be slow, trikes with full fairings usually beat the time of top racers, often by quite a percentage. 

Your only risk for a bad ride is a storm from the south/south east. If there is a storm, you might consider using the train instead of going by bike. There is a rather direct route, called 'Rotterdamseweg' on the Delft end of the route and it changes name to Delftweg when getting beyond half way. When you use Google maps, you can get the bike lanes on top of the usual map, this link should show them. If you do not get the bike lanes, select bike as mode of transport and click on showing bike lanes or 'Fietspaden tonen' if you have the Dutch version. You can also use the cycle nodes, 'knooppunten netwerk' in Dutch, and this site will tell you which numbers to loop out for, allowing you to get the route address to address. The system works with small signs with a number on each corner. You follow that number till you reach it and then you follow the next number on your list. The routes it uses are mostly nicer to use than the direct bike lanes but it might lengthen your trip from 15 to 20 km. Which is still not much. For most countries maybe a funny instruction, but in the Netherlands this can be a problem. If you set off in commuter time, you may find so many cyclists on the paths that you may feel insecure. In that case, wait a few minutes. Most of the time the cyclists come in bunches, regulated by traffic lights earlier on in their trip, when the bunch has past the path will be almost empty. You can also decide to start a bit later. In summer, some paths are so popular that they are busy all the day, but most of the time they are less full than in the morning peak hour. While all routes are sign posted, you may want to have a good map, specially to get out of the one city and into the other.

Handlebar width A well designed bike will have handlebars that go with the steering characteristics as well as with the general looks that belong to that kind of bike. In themselves handlebars do little when riding without hands, but as soon as you hold the bars they have a lot of influence. Wide bars have more of an influence than narrow bars, the point you hold your handlebars will also change how much power you get out of your bars. Drops or straights in itself should not make much of a difference but your position on the bike will differ because of that as well as where you hold your drops. Weight on the front of the bike When I ride the same bike, same riding position but with a basket empty or with up to 10 kilos (22 pound) of groceries, I do see a difference in how well the bike goes straight. This is a bike I can not ride without hands, at all, but I need much less hold on the handlebars when the basket is well laden. I have also noticed that same on other bikes, more weight on the front makes it want to go forward. Which makes it harder if you want to ride without hands on a bike designed to be riden with part of your weight, via your hands, on the handle bars. Riding without hands on a bike I can not do it, but many people can adjust their balance on almost any bike and keep it going straight without touching the handlebars. It is a combination of balance, adjustments as soon as the bike veers off, and confidence that you can pull it off. But remember the old saw: Mum, look, riding without feet (on the pedals,) Mum, look, riding without hands (on the bars,) Mum, look, riding without teeth (in the mouth.) Bike damaged Any bike that is right will stay up when you hold it by the saddle and push it walking besides it, balancing it from that position. But some bikes do take a lot more balancing or can not be kept straight at all, because their wheels are out of line or other parts are damaged. If your bike feels like it steers different or does not want to go straight after a fall or an accident, check (and/or have it checked by a mechanic who knows what he does) and look for the line of the wheels as one of the things. Riding with no hands at all There are a few bikes designed for riding with no use of hands, and a few trikes for people without hands, and those I am aware off are all recumbent bikes and trikes that steer mostly by balance. My current rides are a Flevo bike and a Flevo Trike, which are rather different from the average bike. I still need by hands on the bars when riding, even though others do not. Further reading and watching Rake and trail on a blog post by Dave Molton. Rake or no rake on a fork on bike forums. Bicycle physics about steering, assumes a certain education level. Video which explains how bikes stay up. Video in which you can see a Flevobike in action. Video in which a rider explains the advantages of a Flevobike. 

I think you need to plan on your bike being stolen/damaged a few more times, maybe many more times. The Netherlands have a big bike theft problems, Amsterdam tops that by quite a bit. My mode is always to have a bike that looks less than the ones besides it and lock it with better locks. Two different locks, best one that is not that common in the area. Often locks on Amsterdam bikes are more expensive than the bike itself. A lock that is common where you used to live but not in Amsterdam might work better than a more expensive lock common where the bike is parked. Did you look for a guarded bike parking near where you live? There are quite a few spread around the city and you might find that it is only a few minutes walking for you. I find one on Weesperplein and one at Amstelstation. If you google maps on -bewaakte fietsenstalling- they all pop-up on the map. 

I tend to use several battery powered bike lights on my bike, the rather cheap kind you use for a couple of weeks or even months but do not change the batteries in, with a rubber or elastic band to attach it. Several times each week I use the local pool and most of the time parents leave with their kids after swimming lessons at the time I park my bike and at the time I leave. When mother tells the kid the light is not working I offer one of mine and more than half the time the mother accepts it. While I am a regular at that time, nobody has ever offered it back. My point, the lights are quite cheap and I clearly can miss one (as I still have two working ones at least) and the person getting it and I are both standing still, within easy talking distance. 

Adjust your speed to your needs. I never get to work in sweat as I keep my speed to such a level that I do not get too hot. Wearing the right amount of layers helps as well, as does the ambient temperature. Unlike other users here, I do NOT believe in helmets and I never use one. But if you feel the need for one, it does depend on local laws as well as on (preserved) need for the traffic, think about getting your whole head wet on arrival. (Yes, it can be done under a tap.) There are loads of posts online about taking clothing to work, the most important thing is that you find a way that works for you. So test out different bags, buy or borrow one to clip on your bike if you do not own one yet as a backpacks are sweat collectors. Handlebar, seat post or best bags to clip onto a rear rack. 

Get or make a series of tool rolls, as shown in Mσᶎ's answer, enough for your tools, and (one) more that holds your spare parts. When working in the same place often or for a longer period you can make holes or loops in/on the corners and have hooks on the wall of the work space. Even in your small workspace at home you could put up one or more of the rolls to have what you can use near at hand and out of the way. If you do not have access to a good heavy duty sewing machine, consider getting a speedy stitcher sewing awl. (Link to picture) Canvas you can get from awning making companies or from awings taken down because of being damaged or discoloured. Keep your rolls together in a case. A rolling suitcase would work if you have to walk fair distances, a tool kit case may work for you. It may be best if the case is lockable. Mark all your tools as yours, a bit of coloured tape or a dash of paint will already show others that the tools are yours and not 'general use' or their own. Keep track of your things while working as much as you can. The earlier you start looking for a tool, the more likely it shows up when it is at someone elses workspace. A square of canvas as a work ground, like a picnic blanket for your things, will work wherever you need to work. It will be collecting the tiny parts when they fall on a dirty floor or worse when working outside and on a grassy patch. It can also work to cover your tools and parts when having to walk away from your work. In the Netherlands we use a sawn mitten like teddy cloth item to wash ourselves, which is cheap and readily available. They are great to hold items from being scratched. And they will also hold things like cables contained in a smallish space without damaging the cables. Ziplock bags, in different sizes, are also a great resource.
