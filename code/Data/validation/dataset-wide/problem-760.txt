You're right, Mars' moons likely did not form with from the same dust mass as it; their spectra, albedo, and density are suspiciously similar to those of C- or D-type asteroids. Thus, Mars presumably captured Phobos and Deimos from the asteroid belt. However, the origin of the Martian moons is quite controversial. Burns (1992) notes that capture requires the loss of energy (and momentum, as you pointed out). So obviously, something would need to dissipate that energy. The immediate candidate is aerobraking, but we run into a problem: Mars' atmosphere is too thin to capture a Phobos-sized object through aerobraking. In fact, even if aerobraking could capture Phobos and Deimos, the densities of both moons indicate that they may not survive structurally. Several hypotheses have been proposed to answer this. Landis (2001) suggests tidal forces are to credit: 

You seem to be misunderstanding the term "flatness". In this context, it does not mean the universe looks like a piece of paper in any sense. It instead refers to whether space is warped. 

Would dark matter have a similar effect on the Solar System as it does on the Milky Way? I'd imagine it could help hold together some of the Solar System bodies or at least affect their motion, right? Maybe to a lesser extent, but would it be significant? 

Gravity is the curvature of spacetime, and its effects travel at lightspeed. However, space is expanding; eventually, light from distant galaxies will become more and more redshifted, and we will no longer be able to see them (source). As such, there is a limit to how far we could ever possibly see, since light too far will never reach us due to the rapid expansion of space...or at least, if I'm understanding this correctly. Now, gravitational waves travel at lightspeed. So, after enough time, when an object's light no longer reaches us, will its gravity no longer affect us either? A better rephrasing is: at a certain point in time, will the gravity of any extremely distant object — even the most massive stars, black holes, or galaxies — simply not affect us whatsoever, in the slightest? 

When two black holes come close, they will orbit each other extremely quickly, greatly increasing the strength of their gravity. Over the course of billions of years, they will get closer and closer. Once they come so close that they cannot escape each other's gravity, they will merge to become one bigger black hole. 

A more useful way to describe this is to say the grid is expanding — that space itself, as a coordinate system, is growing. As an analogy, imagine are walking your dog. Suddenly, the ground begins expanding between you. You and your dog will separated and continue receding away from each other. So the same thing is happening with our universe. The grid is in fact growing, and objects are being swept away with it. OK, now that we've gotten the core concepts down, I'll introduce one more bit of terminology. The "scale factor of the Universe" refers to how much the Universe has expanded, compared to now. For example, if in a billion years the scale factor is 3, that means that every object in the Universe is 3 times farther from each other compared to now. If the scale factor 700 million years ago was 0.8, then everything was closer by a factor of 0.8 at that time. By definition, the scale factor is 1 right now. So, if the Universe is expanding now, we'd expect it to be smaller as we look further back in time — i.e. the scale factor would be less. General relativity predicts the scale factor to be zero at 13.8 billion years ago. This would mean that every object would be zero times its current distance from us — in other words, there would be no space. If you think a Universe without space is impossible, you're correct. We apparently have a contradiction. In GR, you can't have a spacetime with zero space. Our modern physical theories work fine up a few fractions of a second after the moment of contradiction, and our observations do agree with the idea of an extremely dense early universe. However, our theories break down as we try to model the Universe at earlier and earlier times, until they no longer prove accurate, preventing us from explaining the most interesting moment. This is why the moment of the Big Bang is one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology. Theories like quantum gravity have arisen to try to explain the conditions near the Big Bang, but none are sufficient as of now. 

This question is by no means silly. Your question is a common one about cosmology (the study of where the universe came from, how it is evolving and what its fate will be). The media often butchers these concepts horribly, resulting in a lot of confusion (out of all scientific information, they seem to have the hardest time reporting cosmology accurately). Your inquisition is definitely a good thing. 

First and foremost, I should clear something up: our knowledge of the Big Bang is incredibly limited, and so we don't even know the origins of the Universe today. General relativity and quantum mechanics both break down as you get closer and closer to $t_0=0$. All we really know is that something happened 13.8 billion years ago. However, if we look at the expanding universe, we can extrapolate that, 13.8 billion years ago, space was much less dilated than it is now. General relativity suggests that the Universe would be packed into a singularity. This is not a good approach, since GR can't properly explain such conditions (QM is more fit to do so, but that alone can't explain how gravity acted), so we really haven't the slightest clue as to what happened 13.8 billion years ago. That said, we still know when the Big Bang (whatever it may have been) occurred, and that's what future astronomers may be able to find out. The idea the article brings up is this: by one trillion years from now, the expansion of space will have driven away any other galaxies from our line of view, and CMB radiation will have become too redshifted to be detectable. However, hypervelocity stars will likely be detected outside of the Milky Way (or rather, Milkomeda). Once these stars get far enough from the Milkomeda's gravitational influence, we can observe their acceleration due to the expansion of space, just as we do for many galaxies today. The 4-page paper the article is based on, Loeb (2011), actually makes this clear in a graph: 

Let me clear this up first. Shape of the Universe means the curvature of the Universe. The meaning of "shape" is not the same as in "what is the shape of this object I'm holding". It doesn't mean that the Universe necessarily has a boundary or is finite in shape — it just describes its space. The idea that the Universe is flat means that the Pythagorean theorem holds up for spatial coordinates. If you've studied non-Euclidean geometry, you'll know that a triangle can have more or less than 180°, depending on the surface its drawn on. If the Universe is flat, we could draw a triangle between spatial coordinates, and the angles would add up to 180°. If the Universe is negatively curved, the angles would add up to less than 180°; if it were positively curved, the angles would be more than 180°. In general relativity, mass, energy, momentum and a bunch of other properties of matter curve spacetime. Thus, most astronomers assume the curvature of space to be very close to zero, although they are not certain of its sign, meaning it may be slightly positive or negative. So we still don't know the exact curvature of the Universe. However, most astronomers postulate that the Universe is infinite in size. This means there is no boundary or "triangular, rectangular, etc." shape. It cannot be viewed from the outside because the Universe is infinite — there's no shape for something that extends infinitely in all directions. 

The law of conservation of energy states that energy is conserved in a closed system. This means the Universe, which is likely an open system, does not necessarily have to obey that conservation law. Not to mention, scientific laws are not absolute, despite their names; they are entirely empirical, and only apply as far as we've observed. As Edwin Hubble put it, "Beyond the limit of the observations, the form of [a] function, or relation, is speculative. For this reason, [a] law is empirical and it must remain empirical until it is explained by an accepted theory." Anyway, let's get on with the answer. You've just described the Black Hole Era in the heat death scenario. If Hawking radiation occurs, then the black hole will continue to emit particles. During the last stages of its evaporation, a black hole will emit not only massless particles, but also heavier particles, such as electrons, positrons, protons, and antiprotons. Once all black holes have evaporated, the Universe will be nearly empty, sans some particles that will almost never interract. Eventually, even the protons and antiprotons emitted by the black holes will decay into photons and leptons. Thus begins the Dark Era, when the Universe will be dominated by dark matter, electrons and positrons. Electrons and positrons will rarely come together and form positronium atoms (in which the electron and positron are electromagnetically bound). Positronium decays very within nanoseconds, since the two particles annihilate. Thus, over time, the energy levels in the Universe will become lower and lower. What happens next is a matter of speculation. According to Carroll & Chen (2004), quantum tunnelling and quantum fluctuations could hypothetically create another Big Bang, approximately $10^{10^{10^{56}}}$ years from now. Adams & Laughlin (1997) speculates that quantum effects will dominate once all macroscopic matter is gone. Essentially, the laws of "macro-physics" will break down, while quantum mechanical phenomena prevail. As a result, the smallest perturbations would make the biggest difference in this era, so there is no telling what may happen to space or time. Furthermore, they speculate that if the Universe is a false vacuum, the vacuum may decay into a lower-energy state, creating a new "child universe": 

Shortly after the Big Bang, temperatures cooled from the Planck temperature. Once temperatures lowered to 116 gigakelvins, nucleosynthesis took place and helium, lithium and trace amounts of other elements were created. However, if the temperatures were so high shortly after the Big Bang, why weren't much heavier elements produced? 116 gigakelvins is obviously far above the temperature required for elements like carbon and oxygen to fuse. In addition, shouldn't most of the protons at those temperatures have fused, leaving the Universe with mostly heavier elements?

Some astronomers consider the ZAMS to be the "birth" of a star, in the sense that the object is no longer a protostar and meets the criteria of a star (source). These astronomers thus consider a star's age to be the time between now and its ZAMS. However, this is simply a matter of terminology, as others consider the formation of the star to be the moment when its molecular cloud collapses. 

If I travelled near a black hole, my time would progress slower relative to someone on Earth. This is clear enough. However, what if we sent a probe with a camera to a black hole? When we watch the screen, would we see time through the camera's perspective — that is, would the Universe appear to progress faster as the probe got closer and closer to the black hole? 

The expansion of the Universe is not happening at the same rate as it was back then. It is slow enough that everything within our Hubble sphere is receding at a lower velocity. 

The main obstacle with the Oscillating Universe model is the pesky second law of thermodynamics — that entropy always increases within an isolated system, and never the reverse. Thus, as time progresses, entropy increases, until it (as far as we know) reaches its maximum — the heat death or Big Rip. Consider the Big Bang, when entropy was at its minimum, or at least incredibly low. As the Universe evolved, entropy increased, as dictated by the second law. If the Big Crunch were to happen, we'd see a decrease in entropy as conditions in the Universe recede back to how they were at $t = 0$. As we've stated, the Universe's entropy can never decrease. But say we ignore the whole "Big Crunch problem" and instead focus on the cycles. As stated before, the entropy always increases with time. I'll let Baum & Frampton (2006) explain the problem:
