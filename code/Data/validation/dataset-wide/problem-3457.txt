The American Economic Association has a list of resources for Economists, including a page for data, there you find links to many institutions that offer all kinds of data, as well as further journals with data archives for the studies they publish. In the ReplicationWiki (that I work on) we have information on more than 2000 empirical studies and you can search for which one what kind of data, software, and methods were used, if the material is available, and if replications are known. Many studies can be browsed by JEL codes or keywords. The categorization of data sources and geographical origin of data remains very incomplete but it is a wiki, so everyone can contribute and make suggestions. 

In the ReplicationWiki (that I founded) you can find replication material for many methods. An overview of empirical studies that used instrumental variables (IV) can be found here. It shows more than a hundred open access datasets for teaching IV regression. You can also see if replications are already known. If you only want cases with data and want to see what software was used you can use the search form like here. There is also information on replications of two studies mentioned above: A 2012 comment on "The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation" and a reply to it, and a replication of a part of the above mentioned study "Does Compulsory School Attendance Affect Schooling and Earnings? (Angrist and Krueger (1991). It uses a different methodology. 

I found an additional series. There is a series Nonfarm Housing Starts (HOUSTNF on FRED) that runs monthly from 1946-01-01 to 1969-12-01. There is about 10 years of overlap with the new series Housing Starts: Total: New Privately Owned Housing Units Started (HOUST on FRED). These series have a correlation coefficient of over 95 percent in their overlapping period. 

A December fiscal year end, which gives a first quarter of three months ending March 30, aligns the fiscal and the tax year. This can be very convenient and in the United States is sometimes required. In addition, some regulated firms like banks are required to prepare documents on calendar quarters regardless of the month of their fiscal year end, and it is often cheaper and easier to have them be synchronized rather than close the books additionally for regulators. Firms may be motivated to alter their fiscal years so that they can better serve their customers or investors. For example, some banks have a fiscal year end not in December so that customers needing to do financial transactions at the end of their year could do so without the bank simultaneously having to close their own books. For many years Morgan Stanley did this. Walmart may be doing this because December is the Christmas shopping season in the United States and management wants to focus on that critical shopping period without the distraction of accounting issues. Additionally, if some shopping comes in after the holiday (say if Hanukkah comes late or because of a rash of belated Festivus shopping), it might split a single shopping season into different fiscal years which could be undesirable for investors trying to compare retailer performance. I don't want to lean too hard on any of these explanations for Walmart's timing. If I recall correctly from looking in Compustat a few years ago more than 80 percent of US listed firms have a December FYE and this didn't vary a huge amount across industries. UPDATE: I went into Compustat and I redid the table of retail, banking, and other firms showing the months of fiscal year end the last 12 months (8/2014-7/2015). I was surprised to see that retail was indeed vastly (>20 times) more likely to have a January FYE than a typical publicly listed firm in 2015. The results appear in the figure below. 

I will try to answer this question although it is rather hard using only one paragraph, if not impossible. A paragraph explaining what New-Keynesian Economics is: Models explaining price and wage stickiness using rational expectations and utility maximizing behaviour. See Gordon, R.J, 1990 for more details. For a defining equation the New-Keynesian Phillips curve is one of the cornerstones of New Keynesian economics: $\pi_{t}=\beta E_{t}\left\{ \pi_{t+1}\right\} +\kappa x_{t}$ Where $x_{t} $ is the output gap, $\pi_{t} $ is inflation at time $t $. $\kappa=\frac{\gamma\left(1-\omega\right)\left(1-\beta\omega\right)}{\omega} $ which is an increasing function of firms being able to change their price that period. Note that this curve is based upon Calvo pricing but one can also use Rotemberg pricing etc. 

Python is also something you could look at for econometric and/or data analysis in addition to R and Gretl mentioned above. Alternatively you could check out the Ox programming language. The Ox console is free to download for academic use. The Ox programming language is the basis for OxMetrics and it is relatively easy to use and extremely fast. For optimization etc. you can get Octave which is a free alternative to MATLAB. I haven't tried Octave so I cannot comment on its qualities but its free so it might be worth checking out. You can also use Octave to simulate economic models in. For simulation of economic models I would recommend you to check out Dynare which is a module for simulating and estimating DSGE and OLG models. Note that in order to use Dynare you'll need to have MATLAB or Octave installed on you computer (Octave is free!). I have used Dynare with MATLAB and it is really easy and intuitive to use. For typesetting you should check out LaTex or the "easier-to-start-to-use" alternative Lyx. In case you want a "Word" type enviroment instead you should check out Open Office. Open Office also has a spreadsheet รก la Excel. 

Papers like Ng and Moench (2011) and Negro and Otrok (2007) use historical housing data to estimate latent variables that correspond to some "true" or "truer" measure of house prices or housing activity. I've put together a table of series one could use as inputs in such an exercise. However, as we can see in the table below, very little data is available before the mid-1970s. I would like to expand this list with U.S. historical data (free or to purchase) that help to characterize real and financial housing activity as far back as possible. What other series am I missing? 

The corporation may front the money, but ultimately that money comes from customers, employees, vendors, creditors, and equity holders. Miller and others have written down models where corporate shareholders bear the burden but it doesn't have to be that way. So to assess the consequences of eliminating the corporate income tax, we really want to know who pays (bears the burden of) the corporate income tax. To the extent that it is the providers of capital of the firm who bear the burden, we might assume that lowering the corporate income tax would act like an income tax cut for the rich. But there are simple models where customers pay some of the corporate income tax, such as if domestic and foreign products (as well as investments) are perfect substitutes, then (immobile) labor pays all the burden of the corporate income tax. Unfortunately, the issue of incidence remains murky despite decades of work on the subject. Regardless of who pays, it is clear that enormous resources are devoted to corporate income tax avoidance probably because corporations have so many more opportunities for tax avoidance than individuals do, due to their complexity, multi-territoriality, and general scale and scope. If eliminating the corporate income tax freed most of those resources invested in corporate taxation preparation and avoidance (on the order of \$150 billion by two estimates just in compliance costs, ignoring strategically wasted resources), resources amounting to something like half of actual corporate income tax revenue would be usable for other activities. Free up those resources and you can make everyone better off, at least in principle. You might for example create a revenue neutral increase in dividends, capital gains, and interest taxation to offset the corporate income tax cut. This could leave beneficiaries of current spending essentially unaffected while the holders of current capital in taxable accounts would be a bit worse off and tax-free accounts (retirement, charities) slightly better off from the direct effects of the tax changes. But since their compliance costs fell massively, there might be enough to make everyone better off. The bottom line is that that the corporate income tax is a expensive way to gather tax revenue from rich people and we are not sure it even does get money from rich people. The corporate income tax can plausibly harm non-rich people in the process. Taxing the income of the rich directly, if that is the end goal, is much more efficient. The resulting efficiency gains can be split between the rich and poor. Even if you don't particularly want to tax the rich, a more efficient tax policy means tax rates can be lowered. So there is something for a liberal and conservative economist alike to love with this tax reform. Here are a couple of papers that suggest that higher corporate income taxes induce corporations to have more debt and less equity (greater leverage), although there is some evidence that reducing these taxes would not reduce leverage in the short run. 

For the US there is a firm that calculates something from monthly data that the quarterly Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) GDP data is also based on: $URL$ 

With the link you posted you get quarterly data, so to get the yearly growth rate you need to change the frequency to annual. There are different aggregation methods but if it's not specified in the question you were asked I don't see how one should be more right than another. 

It's not my field at all but with a quick search I found an ECB working paper from 2010 "INTEREST RATE EFFECTS OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES IN A NEW-KEYNESIAN LIFE-CYCLE FRAMEWORK", by Engin Kara and Leopold von Thadden. The dynare forum is more specialized on DSGE models, you will probably get better advice there. With a quick search there you find several posts that already included something with demography. 

The Behavioral Economics Replication Project could be interesting for you. They presented their research at the 2016 American Economic Association Annual Meeting. 

In the ReplicationWiki (that I work on) we have a list of software packages that were used in more than 2000 empirical studies, mainly in the American Economic Review, American Economic Journals and Journal of Political Economy in the years 2000-2013. Stata was used by far most often (>900 times), followed by MATLAB (280), SAS (60), GAUSS (60), Excel (50), R (30), FORTRAN (30), Mathematica (19), EViews (18), z-Tree (16), dynare (15), RATS (12), C (8), C++ (6), python (5, more recent studies), SPSS (5). There are also examples with ArcGIS, ArcMap, LIMDEP, Maple, Microfit, Ox, ORSEE, PcGive, and TSP. Often times more than one package is used. We do not have cases but I know that some economists also use julia. 

There is a movement in automotive and pedestrian traffic management called Shared Spaces. Under Shared Spaces the vast majority of formal and informal road signage is removed, such as stop signs, traffic lights, raised curbs, road lines. The idea is that these signs makes pedestrians and drivers run follow the signs instead of watching the road and the people on it. When their attention is redirected to city streets and the people on them the hope is that a safer and faster spontaneous order will result. This has been tried in a number of places, most famously Drachten, Netherlands. A study of the Drachten experiment indicated that this caused a significant reduction in traffic accidents in the town. The UK's financial regulator, the Financial Services Authority, switched to a comprehensive principles-based regime in 2003 (Ford (2008)) from a previous regime of detailed rules. This might be another example of a policy intervention to reduce the number of rules. Assessing if this is working is a challenge. For one, international comparisons of financial regulation in the global financial crisis don't tell us much. Almost every rich country experienced failure or near failure of regulated entities. For another, people dispute just how principle versus rules based various national regulatory systems actually are (Black (2010)). 

One book which I have used and which has an excellent chapter on NK-DSGE models is Monetary Theory and Policy by Carl E. Walsh. Even though he only has one chapter on NK-DSGE models (50 pages or so) the chapters before discuss staggered price and wage setting models used in the NK-DSGE models. He also has chapters discussing the Sidrauski MIU model and the Cash-in-Advance models which are close relatives to the RBC and NK-DSGE models. I personally think this book is better than the Galรญ's book. Other books which I haven't used (I once for some years ago used a chapter in the Wickens book) but which get okay reviews on Amazon are: Dynamic General Equilibrium Modeling: Computational Methods and Applications, Macroeconomic Theory: A Dynamic General Equilibrium Approach and The ABCs of RBCs: An Introduction to Dynamic Macroeconomic Models In case you do get the The ABCs of RBCs: An Introduction to Dynamic Macroeconomic Models could you make a quick comment on how it is and if it is worth getting? I think it looks interesting.
