The argument is not very well explained so it's not your fault you don't understand it. The argument runs as follows. Suppose that some procedure like looking in a crystal ball gives accurate predictions about the future. so every time you look in the crystal ball you get accurate predictions. They then say you can use induction to conclude the crystal ball will always be accurate. So any non-inductive method of predicting the future, like crystal ball gazing, can only work if induction works. One reason to be confused about this argument is that it doesn't actually work. Their argument assumes that there is a method called induction that can be used to predict the future given suitable information about the past. But a set of observations implies nothing about the future except in conjunction with some law of nature, i.e. - a claim about what is happening in reality to produce those outcomes. The uniformity of nature is totally irrelevant to this problem since it doesn't specify in what respects nature is uniform. Since induction is supposed to be used to arrive at the law of nature in the first place it can't get off the ground. The reality is that there is no method that is guaranteed to give accurate predictions, or probably give accurate predictions or anything like that. The only way to find laws of nature is to guess and then criticise the guesses. This was explained at length by Karl Popper over the course of several books, see the following list for a guide: $URL$ 

There are philosophy books that explain some programming concepts, such as "Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid" by Douglas R. Hofstadter, which is primarily about philosophy of mind. There are other aspects of programming I can think of at the moment to which philosophy is relevant. The first issue is that the organisation and writing of programs is about how to express knowledge in a precise way that both you and the computer can read. It is important that people should be able to read your programs, including you. If you write programs and revisit them later and you can't read them then you wrote the program wrongly in the first place. One interesting book to read about how to write programs and reason about them is Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programming. The second issue is that how your organise projects is about the best way to organise the creation of knowledge. For example, adding a new person to a team increases the complexity of communication among team members and makes reaching agreement more difficult. For this and other similar problems see "The Mythical Man Month" by Fred Brooks. A third issue that is somewhat related to the first issue is the relevance of mathematical ideas to programming practice. There are people who come up with fancy quasi-mathematical tools to test programs, such as the people in the Haskell community. These tools have some uses but some people such as Rich Hickey have pointed out that every bug in a program has passed tests, so tests are not a magic bullet. Also, a proof of mathematical correctness indicates that the program does something correctly, not necessarily what you want it to do. In addition the vast bulk of code simply can't be reasoned about mathematically since the computer has to deal with complex things for which we have no model, like some hardware and users. Finally, programming is a labour saving technology. Once you have understood how to solve a problem once you can mechanise solving it. In that sense, programming is part of a process of potentially open ended progress that took off in a major way with the industrial revolution. To understand why this potentially open ended progress is good see "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch and "The Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution" by Ayn Rand and Peter Schwartz. 

Your first sentence ought to end with a question mark since it is a question. You don't keep questioning until nothing is left. You also don't pick any fixed point on which to stand. Tearing down all your knowledge until nothing is left makes no sense since a lot of your knowledge is okay. You can walk down the street without killing yourself so there is no reason to think you ought to ditch your knowledge about walking. A fixed point doesn't make any sense since you can't explain which fixed point you take. If you're going to try to build all of your knowledge on some fixed point you have to pick it arbitrarily. Any non-arbitrary way of picking it would require knowledge, which is what you're supposed to get from the starting point. There is no need for a starting point. The way you actually understand and create knowledge is to look for problems with your existing knowledge, propose ideas that might solve the problems and criticise the proposals until only one is left and it has no known problems. This is rational in the sense that it will allow you to fix problems. Any notion of rationality that involves justification (showing ideas are true or probably true) will suffer from the dilemma of questioning forever or irrationally picking a fixed point. So all theories involving justification are irrational. The person who originally understood this was Karl Popper, see 'Realism and the Aim of Science', Chapter I and 'On the sources of knowledge and of ignorance' in 'Conjectures and Refutations'. Also, Popper often took the position that hypothesis formulation was an evolutionary process involving some sort of internal trial and error of hypotheses. See Popper's contribution to Radnitzky and Bartley volume on 'Evolutionary Epistemology'. Popper's point about the origin of a theory was that it didn't much matter where an idea came from if it stood up to criticism. 

I don't know what Marx would say about current identity politics, and I don't think the question is answerable. There is a different question you could ask: could Marxism provide any moral principle that would allow Marx to resist current identity politics? The answer is no. Marx favoured the rule of the proletariat. As such, he accepted the principle that the right system involves a particular group of people being in charge and controlling everyone else. This principle is anti-rational. It involves saying that people outside a particular group are always wrong and baking that into the political system so that any criticisms held by those outside the favoured group are ignored except at the whim of the rulers. There can't be any legitimate argument for such a system. So people can only hold it by ignoring criticisms and abandoning the practice of deciding what to do by open-ended critical argument. Now, suppose somebody comes along and claims that a different group than the proletariat should control everyone else. If you want to reply, your reply can't be that you should take a step back from both positions and consider what principle determines who should be in charge. If you do that, you find that there is no such principle. Rather, that appropriate principle is that you should have institutions that enable the replacement of bad policies and rulers. This is incompatible with both identity politics and Marxism. Identity politics and Marxism are also both incompatible with free markets. A free market would be set up so that it was easy for people to make agreements where you benefit from providing an agreed good or service, but you can refuse to do so if you're willing to pay a price you agreed on when you formed the agreement. This sort of system has ways of correcting errors in how people act on their ideas. If you come up with a bad idea about how to do something and try to implement it, then you will have to make agreements you can't deliver on and you will have to pay the price. You will run out of resources for implementing the bad idea. Identity politics and Marxism are both opposed to this principle since they want only the favoured group to have the right to dictate what others do. As such, identity politics and Marxism are both opposed to free markets. Free markets and any other rational political institution are a mortal threat to Marxism and identity politics, so Marxism and identity politics have a problem in common. At the same time Marxists and identity politics people can't both have their favoured group in charge. So at some point both groups either have to change position by rational discussion or coerce the other group into cooperating. As you may have guessed by now, I think both Marxism and identity politics are evil. My main advice to anyone who holds either position is to reconsider your position. Leaving aside all the other objections, wanting to fight other people all the time sounds like a boring and shitty way to live your life. You should be interested in learning about institutions that facilitate dealign with other people voluntarily, such as free markets.
