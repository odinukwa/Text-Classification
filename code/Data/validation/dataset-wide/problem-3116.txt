I did find a reference to HMS Dragon 13 Dec 1709. Perhaps that's a different ship. Because I found below pretty conclusive evidence Charles Hargrave was a merchantman in 1747. I found Charles Hargrave page 180 in 1744/47 as master of a different ship "Mercury" at the port of Annapolis Maryland. Charles had a pretty interesting life.... Found this about Charles Hargrave also 1747. cell 1013 

There would be many of these kinds of Behaviors from Microsoft. Where Microsoft leveraged OS capabilities to gain and maintain a dominant predatory position in the software market. 

Did the Greeks fear the Persian Immortals. It's probable unlikely most greeks even knew about the Persian elite royal guard. Regardless I think most of the Greeks would have been fearful of the Persian Military in General. It was an exceedingly large army, and had accomplished much in the Middle East and on Persia's other boarders and the Greeks as traders would have been aware of those military sucesses. Did the Spartans? 300 Spartans (along with other Greeks) faced off against one of the largest armies ever assembled up to that point and refused all entreaties to negotiate even a symbolic acceptance of Persian rule. That is not the act of a people who fear. That is an action of near contempt. 

. Because Jay's Treaty(1794) was one sided in favor of the British. It basically codified into a treaty the abuses which the United States was upset about. Can you imagine any country today signing a treaty saying one nation may stop it's shipping on the high seas, confiscate cargo without reimbursement while permitting the continued kidnapping of sailors for forced service in the foreign nations navy!! All this and it didn't really grant the Americans any concession which was not already agreed too! This treaty's failure to address any of the major outstanding issues especially impressment, basically is what lead to the war of 1812 where some of the same issues were still around and unresolved in a manor the US could live with. John Jay's treaty was negotiated by a pro British Chief Justice John Jay, who's biggest bargaining chip was surrendered, before negotiations even began and the resulting treaty reflects that. The only British concession was to vacate the fortresses they had already agreed to vacate under the terms of the Paris Treaty(1783) which ended the Revolutionary War a decade earlier. US Concerns Before the Treaty: 

Background The United States company, Standard Oil was broken up in 1911 for being a monopoly, but by 1941 had largely reconstituted its monopoly under one of it's surviving branches, Standard Oil of New Jersey. Standard Oil of New Jersey or Esso, would become Exxon and in 1941 was the largest company in the world and controlled about 80% of the United States oil production. The United States at the time was the largest oil producer in the world. Standard oil had been doing a lot of business with Germany after WWI and basically they continued it during the early parts of WWII both before and after Pearl Harbor. Treaty of Versailles After WWI the United States never ratified the Treaty of Versailles which was the most important peace treaty ending WWI. The United States Senate could never consolidate 2/3rds support to ratify the treaty and thus in the early 1920's the United States signed individual treaties with Germany, Austria, and Hungary(Austria-Hungary was broken up after WWI). The Treaty of Versailles was harsh to Germany on many levels including economically, the fact that the US never ratified it and was not bound by it made Germany an attractive business investment venue post war for American companies. Standard Oil of New Jersey was one of many United States companies which did significant business with Germany, including Nazi Germany as Hitler was coming to and in power. A major investor in Standard Oil of New Jersey was the Germany Chemical Company I.G. Farben(Second largest stock holder). I.G. Farben was the largest chemical company in the world prior to WWII and was a very important resource for Nazi Germany's war effort. They produced many synthetic materials (oil, gasoline, rubber, nitrates, and fiber) which were not available or scarce in Germany during the war. They also produced medicines (vaccines and drugs such as Salvarsan, aspirin, Atabrine, Novocain, sulfa drugs, poison gases). They used concentration camp labor during the final solution. You get the picture. 

"The Betsy" seized by Morocco in 1784 was the first United States ship seized at sea. The Betsey was a merchant brig and was seized off the coast of Spain. Great Britain recognized the independence of the U.S. by the Treaty of Paris signed in September 1783. U.S. ships ceased to be covered by the tribute Britain was paying to the Barbary pirates at that time. Having a treaty with one pirate nation did not mean you were safe from the other pirate nations. Morocco was in negotiation with the US at the time Jefferson was in Paris to get the United States to pay her tribute, like all of the European nations paid the Barbary pirates tribute. The US declined and that's why they took the Betsy. To coerce the United States into a tribute plan. source 

I would argue that both the US and Germany where mechanized, rather both had mechanized components; while only the US was entirely motorized. The US “horse” in WWII was the JEEP. Russia, 1941. SS Cavalry Brigade 

The German army was not motorized. In Poland, France and Russia the German army was dependent on horses to carry supplies and even troops to the front. The German Army entered World War II with 514,000 horses, and over the course of the war employed, in total, 2.75 million horses and mules; the average number of horses in the Army reached 1.1 million. In 1939 the United States Cavalry consisted of two mechanized and twelve horse regiments of 790 horses each. However by 1942 The United States entered WWII as a fully motorized force. As World War II progressed, most major armies integrated tanks or assault guns with mechanized infantry, as well as other supporting arms, such as artillery and engineers, as combined arms units. The US produced about a half dozen armored personnel carriers totaling about 70,000 vehicles throughout the war(see below). These included the M2 Half Track Car (13,500), M3 Halftrack (41,000), M8 Greyhound (11,667), M20 Armored Utility Car (3,680) and the M9 Half Track Car (3,500). Total production of the M3 ran to nearly 41,000 vehicles.To supply the Allied nations International Harvester produced several thousand of a very similar vehicle, the M5 Half-track for Lend-Lease. It was used by the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union through out the war. Variants included Armored personnel carriers, self propelled guns, mobil Anti-aircraft units, and 40 mm. 50 mm carriers. Total production of M2 and derivatives was about 13,500 units. To meet the needs of Lend-Lease to the Allies, the International Harvester Company produced 3,500 units of the M9. The US Also produced about 11,000 M8 Greyhound Armored Cars M20 Armored Utility Cars (3,680), U.S. M3 halftracks and infantry on exercises, Fort Knox, June 1942 

The issue was that the Union had the high ground (Cemetery Ridge) and the more defensible positions. By attacking Little Round Top at the unions left, the Confederates were trying to flank them and fold up their lines. They were trying to avoid the costly frontal charge which they ultimately did attempt in Pickett's charge.. During this frontal attack on Cemetery Ridge, The attacking Confederates(Picket,Pettigrew,Trimble, Wilcox,Lang) had 50% casualty rate, or 6000 men. There is a plaque at the Gettysburg Battlefield where they temporarily penetrated union lines.. On that plaque it says "The High Water Mark of the Confederacy". The last major offensive by the south of the civil war, from this point on Lee retreated. And to your point.. Why did Lee attack the Union in such fortified positions. General Longstreet objected on the same grounds.. He counseled that Lee should retreat, the Union's fortifications are too strong. But Lee felt the opportunity of defeating the union army was too tempting to ignore and overruled Longstreet. It was the biggest mistake of the war for Lee. 

The United States Postal system began Rural Free Deliver (RFD) in the late 19th century. This program mandated to postal service deliver mail directly to rural families and greatly increased the cost and complexity of mail. Prior to this mail was mostly delivered to central locations and individuals were responsible for traveling and picking up their own mail. Some places individuals had to travel for days to collect their mail. RFD would begin to change that. 

Yes originally under the Articles of Confederation(March 1, 1781) which was the first attempt to form a union by the 13 colonies. Absolutely the "Union" was intended to be originally a loose confederation where the federal government had no revenue streams except those which unanimously were agreed upon by the states. This article was so weak the federal government could not even pay the interest on it's war debt, much less defend itself with a standing army. The failure of the Articles of Confederation is the reasons why James Madison and George Washington advocated for the passing of the stronger document with a stronger federal government, including an executive and the right to tax; the Constitution. Madison being a primary author, and Washington being the documents highest profile supporter, and President of the Constitution convention(1787). Even after the Constitution was ratified(June 21, 1788) this question wasn’t settled. The simple truth is the founding fathers didn’t agree. Jefferson believed any state which freely entered the union was free to leave if it suited then. Patrick Henry, George Mason(the only founding father who refused to sign the Constitution), and Monroe in his younger days agreed with Jefferson. George Washington, Madison, John Jay, and Alexander Hamilton disagreed. The latter three wrote as much in the Federalist Papers saying a division of the union would mean 1000 years of war as two nations would follow the same history as European nations which fought 1000 years of war over economic, religious or cultural reasons and was to be avoided at all costs. This was the motivation for the north fighting the south in the civil war. To preserve the union. It became about slavery for the north later in the war. Original Answer: Actually you are incorrect. The House of Representatives in the original Constitution was always elected by popular vote. The peoples house. The Presidency, Senate, and Supreme Court were appointed by representatives of the people and not by popular vote itself. source 

The formal definition of a depression is a severe recession. The formal definition of an economic recession is a decline in gross domestic product (GDP) for two or more consecutive quarters. By definition a recession is over when the economy(GDP) shows quarterly growth. Every quarter of Herbert Hoover's Presidency the GDP had gotten worse. In FDR's first six month in office, FDR had the GDP going in the right direction again. Formally given the definition, the Great depression ended in FDR's first six months in office when GDP began to grow again. 

On the American Side: Not very advanced surprisingly enough. Encoding a message was geared towards fooling unsophisticated inspections. Different techniques in addition to Encoding were used in conjunction which altogether provided some protection but again mostly geared towards untrained or unsuspecting inquiry. It was important that whatever codes used would be simple enough that they could be de-coded. And since both sides processes had to be done by hand(encoding and decoding) they also needed to be relatively simple to perform. Invisible Ink The first layer of protection was stealth, invisible ink used by both sides would be used to write inside book bindings or between the lines of innocent correspondence or commercial documents. Innocent documents which the Americans hoped a busy sentries would not inspect too closely. Since both parties used invisible ink, it was not considered a full proof protection and would not stand up to anything but rudimentary inspection. The key or decoding mechanism for solving invisible ink being heating the page was common knowledge on both sides of the Revolutionary War. Washington would try to address this by commissioning a new invisible ink one who's key was a chemical solution rather than heat, but that ink was rare due to a lack of ingredients. Code Book The Americans would use a codebook with numbers which would be substituted for names, places, and dates to help conceal the messages if discovered. For example the number 711 referred to George Washington. So instead of saying George Washington they would use the number. The reason why the code book was not particularly secure is because it was constant throughout the war. So it too could be defeated over time given enough intercepted messages. Cyphers Encoding text was typically done with straight alphabet cyphers and would be used in conjunction with the codebook to obfuscate words or names which were not in the shared codebook. 

Short Answer: Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was always going to end badly. Staling hated Hitler and Hitler hated Stalin like no other leader in Europe. That Hitler struck first is probable not as big a mistake as it seems. Germany and the Soviet Union were always going to mix it up. Hitler's big mistake in attacking the Soviet Union was not advancing on Moscow in a timely manner and getting distracted. Most Historians split on whether the German General Staff would have been successful in Russia without Hitler's meddling. Hitler's delays in attacking Moscow meant the poorly outfitted German army had to fight through one of the coldest Russian Winters in History and the German army never recovered. Longer Answer: Hitler was capable of great innovative ideas, but he was also capable of huge mistakes. Most of Hitlers generals believed invading Poland was a mistake because at the time Germany didn't have much left guarding the boarder with France. Then most of his generals thought invading France was a mistake, given WWI's experience and conventional wisdom being that the French Army was the strongest on the continent, not to mention Great Britains forces. In each of these instances Hitler had proven correct despite his generals objections. One of the great debates in WWII is whether left to their own devices, without hitlers meddling could the German General staff had been successful in Russia. It's unclear, but what is clear is without Hitler they likely wouldn't have attacked the Soviet Union in June of 1941, and with Hitler they couldn't be successful. Hitler had gained popularity in the 1920's upon four foundational points. (1) attacking the Treaty of Versailles (2) promoting Pan-Germanism, (3) anti-semitism (4) anti-communism Hitler who was actually incredible poorly informed on many subjects which he liked to talk like an expert on, like internal American politics.. and like how influential Jewish citizens were in every country he wanted to invade. Hitler often equated anti-communism and anti-semitism as he believed communism was a jewish plot to control the world.(**) That Hitler hated communists more than the British came to news to nobody. Hitler and the Nazi's had fought street fights against communists in Germany before coming to power. He hated communism with a passion and stated as much in 1000 speeches and prominently in his own biography Mein Kamf ( my struggle). Hitler dreamed of purging Russia from Jews and Communists and capturing all that land for German use, probable in that order too. So why did Stalin align himself with Germany. why did the Soviet Union agree to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. Because the Soviet Union was totally unprepared for war and was buying time. Stalin was trying to prepare as quickly as he could, as all of Europe was preparing. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact bought Russia two years, which was probable worth it for Stalin. Hitler betrayed Stalin attacking in June of 1941, because he saw an opportunity which probable didn't exist to take the Soviet Union out quickly before they could fully prepare. Which brings us back to colossal mistakes which Hitler was capable of. Yes it was a mistake to invade the Soviet Union because it caused Germany to be again be trapped in a two front war. The real fatal miscalculation was when Hitler paused and diverted forces from Army Group Centre to the south towards Kiev Ukraine. The delay stalled the attack on Moscow and forced ill-equipped(winter clothing) German troops to fight in one of the worst Russian winters ever recorded. Germany never recovered. The Wehrmacht was not able to sustain its pressure on Moscow, instead fighting, and eventually retreating, across all Russian teritory. (*)Why was Moscow so important? I saw a previous comment about Napoleon took Moscow and it didn't help him avert a catastrophe in Russia's winter. The answer is Trains. Moscow was the central train hub for all of the Soviet Union. If Hitler had controled Moscow he would have controled all the train systems which Russia used to transport not only troops but all their military and civilian logistics. If Hitler had taken Moscow it would have been game over. (**) Hitler also believed capitalism was a jewish plot to control the world so go figure.
