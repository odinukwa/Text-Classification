I've just seen the LiveScience article 70-Mile-Long Crack Opens Up in Anatarctica. I'm not sure if the title is a bit sensational or not, the crack is in an ice shelf, not the continent of Antarctica. 

The PTWC is the The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Were Tsunami-like changes in sea level detected automatically and forwarded to some center before they reached any shoreline, or does "detected" refer to the relatively small tsunami wave shown in (for example) this or this YouTube video? 

60m/s is 216 km/h, and this is consistent with a few hundred km in a few hours also mentioned. Question: If I just google the speed of a Tsunami on Earth, I see 800 km/h. The surface gravity on Mars is about 3.71 m/s^2, or about a factor of 2.6 lower than that of Earth. Does this explain the factor of 4 slower speed of the Tsunami wave quantitatively?

I snapped this photo with my phone flat against the window of a bus, facing south while traveling west across a bridge in New Taipei City. I'd say it was at about 24.995N, 121.438E. It was about 14:00 local time, 28-05-2017, a cool day, roughly 20C outdoors but I don't know the temperature in the mountains. The overall bluish/greenish hue is the result of the tinting of the bus' window. Is there a name for this "pouring clouds" effect? 

The BBC News article Isolated lakes found beneath Canadian ice sheet links to the open access Science Advances article Discovery of a hypersaline subglacial lake complex beneath Devon Ice Cap, Canadian Arctic. The discovery is based on radar "soundings" of the Devon Ice Cap in Nunavut, Canada. I'm having trouble understanding the nature of the evidence for liquid water as stated in the article. I understand that there will be a relatively strong reflection at an interface where the dielectric constant changes, and that this is expressed in dB in some of the plots, but I don't understand the blue "blobs" or the axis label shown. I've cropped some of the plots and rearranged them below to help highlight the "blue blobs" below. Also it looks like the potential lakes are associated with dips in the underlying bedrock contour, but I can't tell if the lakes are sitting on top of the bedrock, or at an intermediate elevation above it with ice both above and below them, and I don't understand at all what the axis label in other plots means. And why does the top surface of the ice look relatively flat in the radar images, but rise and fall hundreds of meters in the plots? Did the plane fly at a fixed distance with respect to the top ice surface rather than a fixed elevation? 

I'd like to have a rough idea of how large local surface CO2 concentration vary due to natural processes. For example, a purely hypothetical experiment: If I set up some CO2 monitors in a wide variety of locations around the globe (e.g. mid-ocean, jungle, desert, plains, tundra, mountaintop, beach...), say at 2 meters off the ground, and took some measures to avoid close proximity to substantial anthropogenic CO2 sources (industrial, transportation, population, farms) and fires or episodic geological sources (e.g. volcanos or magma pockets under lakes per @jamesqf), roughly speaking what might the variation look like? A starting guess might be that they'd all be nearly featureless, around 400ppm, with only say +/- 10 or 20 ppm daily and yearly oscillations. Of course there is a whole lot of important science within those variations, but for the purposes of this question, I'd call those variations small. Would my detector in a forest or jungle see higher peaks, or deeper troughs than one in a desert, or mid-ocean? What might the biggest excursions be? Might it ever reach down to 300 or up to 500 ppm due to natural processes? The reason I'm asking is that while I tried to so some searches, it is very popular to show data from urban and suburban locations, where peaks of 500 or 600 ppm or even higher are seen that are attributed to wind direction and concentrated man-made sources, and that variation is not what I'm after. Here is just one example (48 hours and yearly) but there are many much larger studies published with sensors in urban areas. 

The image below is included in the BBC article Amazing white rainbow snapped over Scottish moor. Apparently this phenomenon is sometimes called a "fog-bow" and is characterized by the washing out of perceived color relative to a conventional rainbow. Is this related to the geometry (fog being far closer to the viewer) or properties of the droplets themselves? If so, which properties and why? Higher resolution in flickr 

Reading about turbidity, I came across this web page with the frightening image shown below. Text immediately before reads: 

I saw the catchy Phys.org news title Artificially cooling planet 'risky strategy,' new research shows and then looked at the open access article, in Nature Communications (14-Nov-2017 online) Impacts of hemispheric solar geoengineering on tropical cyclone frequency, Jones et al. doi:10.1038/s41467-017-01606-0 

Is there a way to understand why a tilt is required in current theories of planetary magnetic fields?

The BBC article Taiwan rainbow 'lasts record-breaking nine hours' also mentions that Guinness World Records lists six hours as the current record. See also Taiwan News Taiwan shatters world record for longest-lasting rainbow. Usually rainbows are on the opposite side of the sky from the Sun. We usually see them in the evening or morning. How can a rainbow be seen for nine or even six hours? 

I first saw the term "Imilac meteorite" in this BBC News article. It shows a photograph of a meteorite on display along with the caption: 

This question describes a recently released explanation for flashes of light seen at the sub-solar point above Earth from the DSCOVR satellite, which is located in a special orbit between the Earth and Sun at a distance of about 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth. I won't reproduce the full question here. I'm asking about the discussion in the following paper about flat ice plates of order 100 microns in size at about 5,000 to 8,000 meters in altitude in thin clouds over land. Specifically the idea that areas that are tens of kilometers wide could contain plates that are all coplanar - parallel to the local Earth's surface and more importantly to each other, to within about 0.1 degrees. While here is part of the discussion section of the paper, further explanation of the geometry of the satellite and Sun are in the linked question.
