As stated by Amo, there is a real need for consensus. If consensus is missing, no law will work. Whatever the government may try. Take for example prohibition in the thirties. There was enough public support to make alcohol illegal. Then, as now, people were often forced to support the law. Any politician not supporting a ban on alcohol was walking on very thin ice. Naming and shaming were popular tactics, just as today. Anti alcohol advocates used every trick in the book to sway public opinion in their favor. I don't say they broke the law doing that, but at the very least went as far as possible to sway opinion makers to support them. The public generally approved of it. Alcohol was a big problem back then. But when the laws were there, they still wanted a drink. They approved of the idea, but not the reality. There is, thank be the gods, wide public support to ban Nazism in Europe. Hate speech is a different matter. A ban on Nazism is clear enough. What is hate speech exactly? It's getting very close to 'anything I don't approve of, no matter the arguments'. That makes is very difficult to enforce, because the general public probably doesn't accept that. In the past, when smoking became popular in Europe, both the authorities and the church try to ban it. Health issues weren't known back then. The church even excommunicated people who smoked. Penalties and fines were harsh. Didn't work, because the consensus wasn't there. Look at big political changes in society: the French revolution, before that the the Reformation and in particular the liberal revolutions of 1848. The authorities (kings, pope) did what they could to suppress it, in the end without much success. Why? Because the general public in the end didn't support them. They lacked the consensus. 

Robert's account of Urban's speech follows. Robert claims that he was personally present at the Council; there is no particular reason to believe or disbelieve this statement. He wrote his chronicle in 1107, twelve years after the events took place, so it is entirely plausible that he was present and was recounting his own memories; it's also possible that he was relying on second-hand accounts. The account of Fulcher of Chartres, who is more generally accepted to have been present, does not mention the precise location of the speech. Guibert de Nogent, who wrote a history of the First Crusade but was not present at the Council of Clermont, provides no further details either. There are three other sources concerning this speech, but I have been unable to locate English translations of their complete texts online. According to Wikipedia, two of them (Urban's letter and the anonymous Gesta Francorum) do not discuss the circumstances or content of the speech in any great detail. It's possible that the account of Baldric of Dol contains some detail about the circumstances of the speech, but like Guibert he was not present at the Council. 

The Hebrew Bible is among the early texts mentioning Susa (under the Hebrew name of Shushan which is the same world as a lily) but there exist somewhat older, Sumarian documents that mention Susa, e.g. Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta where Susa is quoted as a place obedient to Inanna, a goddess of love. This text is from the 21st century BC but similar Sumerian texts going back to the 25st century BC may exist. The Sumerian civilization probably existed 4,000 BC and could have used the "same" words. They began to write around 3,000 BC. Susa comes from the name of the local deity, Inshushinak. Conveniently, this word "works" in English. God Inshushinak was "in Shusha". Most sources logically say that the relationship is the other way around: Inshushunak "means" the lord of Susa. The Sumerian language – the most ancient known written language – was a language isolate which makes conclusions about the relationship of their words to words in other languages particularly problematic. (Can the beginning "in" of the deity's name be identified with "in" in English, for example?) It is hard to claim that its words are related to words such as "six" if linguists don't even agree to which modern languages Sumerian was closer. It's easy to get carried away and propose relationships most of which are almost certainly coincidental. For example, šuša could be claimed to be related to the Czech word "šuškat" (whispher) or "šiška" (conifer cone) or "sušák" (dryer) or "sušit" (dry) or "sušenka" (a dry cookie) or even "šůsovat" (slang for fast direct Alpine skiing) but is there any reason to think that the similarity is more than a coincidence? Most of such short combinations of sounds are being used in every language. The Sumerian word has affected lots of names in the Elamite culture. The Elamite language was another language isolate, however. 

The Franklin expedition has been in the news again recently, as the wreck of the HMS Terror was recently located by the Arctic Research Foundation. This follows the discovery of the wreck of the HMS Erebus by the same foundation in 2014. One thing I have never quite understood about the expedition: why didn't the explorers "go native" and live among the Inuit to survive? The Wikipedia article on the expedition notes that 

Francisco de Miranda comes close. Born in 1750 in Caracas, Venezuela, he became an officer in the Spanish Army in 1773. In 1779, Spain signed the Treaty of Aranjuez and entered the American Revolutionary War as an ally of France; their ultimate goals were to regain Gibraltar, Florida, and Minorca from the British. As part of the campaign in Florida, Miranda participated in the Siege of Pensacola; his diary is one of the primary sources we now have concerning the siege. The one caveat here is that the Siege of Pensacola did not involve any American units, nor was it fought on land that became part of the United States immediately after the Revolutionary War; so a less charitable interpretation might view this as an opportunistic land-grab by the Spanish & French, designed to stick a thumb in the eye of the British, and not part of the "true" war effort. But then, one could say much the same about the French involvement in the Revolutionary War, and nobody denies that they greatly assisted the cause. Miranda's role in the Latin-American wars of liberation is less in debate. After the end of the Revolutionary War, Miranda was charged with being a spy for the British and went into exile, first in the United States (where he hobnobbed with the American Founding Fathers), then in the UK. In 1806 he returned to the USA and organized a filibustering expedition to try to liberate Venezuela from the Spanish; unfortunately, this first expedition failed and Miranda returned to the UK. When Napoleon invaded Spain, the Spanish colonies gained de facto independence, and some established juntas to govern themselves. The Supreme Junta of Caracas sent a delegation to the UK, met with Miranda, and convinced him to return to Venezuela. Upon his return, he began agitating for independence, and the junta finally declared the First Republic of Venezuela in 1811. However, several provinces of Venezuela remained loyal to the rump Spanish royalist government in Cádiz, and civil war broke out. As the First Republic collapsed, Miranda was given sole command of its armies; but it was too late, and the armies of the First Republic were defeated. Some of the republican officers (including one Simon Bolívar) arrested Miranda and handed him over to the Spanish Royal Army. He died in prison in Cádiz five years later. While Miranda was not involved in the later successful wars of Latin-American Independence, he gained the nickname El Precursor ("The Precursor") for being one of the first to agitate for independence. If nothing else, Bolívar learned a lot from Miranda's failures (see the Cartagena Manifesto.) 

The question implicitly hides a misconception, namely the opinion that to succeed and establish policies, one needs a lot of "support", majorities in opinion polls, majorities in the Parliament, friendship of the media, and similar things. That's not how Otto von Bismarck did things. He used to have some connections to the old feudal order but was gradually losing their support. He was generally disliked by the public. He had to deal with hostility with Denmark, Austria, and France. He had no army backing him, no political party, and he controlled no seats in the Parliament. But he has defeated all these powers – the old order, public, working class, France, Italy, Denmark, and others – and prevailed. He was truly the first big skillful politician in the modern sense, one who knows how to switch between alliances and betray previous allies, and that's why he was also able to found the bureaucratic government of the modern type (which didn't depend on any previously recognized "power" or "class") – with all the aspects such as the welfare state and healthcare (that's how he bought a sufficient fraction of the working class and suppressed the influence of social democracy etc.) and many other things. 

It's a common misconception that knights in full armor couldn't get up when they fell down. In real life they could, without much difficulty. Jumping and running was also not a problem. The could mount a horse without assistance, and run short distances. Good armour fits the body well, all over. The weight was evenly distributed. If a knight fell in the mud at Agincourt, he would get up if he could. No armor gives perfect protection. Not even today. There are lots of gaps that cannot be protected. For example, at the groin, the armpits, the neck and the visor. Every soldier had a weapon at hand to finish off a knight in those places. Stilettos and misericordes were designed just for that purpose. The spike on a pollaxe did the same. In medieval times, knights normally didn't want to kill other knights in battle. They ransomed them. Much more profitable. That didn't apply to common soldiers. A knight killed them whenever he could. Of course, the favor was returned. Common foot soldiers usually didn't give mercy to knights. Unless ordered differently. In some battles, Agincourt was one of them, no mercy was given. Most French knights weren't killed during the battle, but afterwards. On orders of the king. He feared so many knight-prisoners was too dangerous under the circumstances. === Off topic, slightly: Armor was worn ... because it worked!! Ask yourself: why on earth would someone wear 5 up to 30 kg of useless metal all day long? Roman legionaries got up, put on their lorica and went to work. Medieval soldiers did about the same. Why would soldiers do that? They have lots of other useful stuff that they much rather carry around. 

The component is called a speaker or a loudspeaker and Alexander Graham Bell was indeed the person who invented this component in 1876. A current goes to a coil which acts like a magnet and depending on the magnitude of the current, it attracts or repels a static magnet that is attached to a piece of paper. 

These questions are nicely answered in various historical books, e.g. Political Legitimation in Communist States. The short answer is that he didn't. If you click at this link, you will be told that first of all, contrary to an uninformed claim by another user, Lenin has never been considered a charismatic man during his life – simply because he obviously wasn't one. He didn't look like a leader, he was short (165 cm), he didn't have a haircut of a supermodel, and his voice was uninspiring, too. Also, if his political influence is subtracted, he was no influential star in philosophy. Intellectually, he could have been considered a marginal annoying mediocre bookworm. Lenin was never considered a natural leader of peasants or workers during his life. And those weren't really searched for in the socialist movement, anyway. The socialist movement didn't respect any Führer Prinzip, unlike the nationalist movements. Those who were building this Marxist paradise were supposed to believe that it was a historical necessity, not that they were lucky to be given an exceptional leader. He was just able to perform effective political steps at the right time. He threatened the founding of a new party and weakened his foes when it mattered, and actually founded the new party when it was optimal, and so on. It was a modern political strategy building on the example of people like Bismarck – except that his goals were very different. At the end, he got to the top. But the idea that Lenin was charismatic or had a cult of personality is just a posthumously fabricated fairy-tale of his ideological soulmates. Even Stalin who can be said to be much more charismatic wasn't really naturally charismatic. Just like Lenin, he was short, around 165 cm, had a bad skin, some scars from the smallpox during his childhood, and so on. These men just managed to accumulate a lot of power which allowed them to fabricate a virtual reality as well. And when the regime worked, many ordinary people only had the access to the virtual reality. During Lenin's reign, it was only the artificially invented idealization of the leader that had some cult of personality, not Lenin himself. 

In 1976 Tim Severin proved with the Brendan Voyage it was possible for Irish monks not only to go to Iceland, but all the way to the Americas. He did have a couple of advantages the ancients didn't have: 

Be aware that the German army from the armistice onwards planned to regain its old size, stature and position. The German army trained (secretly) officers and tactics in the USSR between the wars. The German navy developed (illegally) submarines in Holland and Sweden. Long before this lance corporal H. comes into play. All he actually did was turn the switch from 'covert' to 'full production'. When that happened, it paid off. Germany reintroduced the draft again in 1935. All existing ranks were bumped up one level. Corporals became sergeants, lieutenants captains, colonels brigadiers, etc. It's very difficult to grow a force of 100.000 man into a force of 3 million, but the Germans did it almost overnight. Not without problems, though. Enough and capable non commissioned officers was always a big problem during WW2. Over all, the flexibility of the German army was far superior to that of the allies. The Allies won because they out produced Germany in every field. They had far more tanks. More, not better. With the exception of the T 34. Much higher mechanization (most German divisions had horse drawn supply carts), and from mid 1944 total air supremacy. Even so, it took them almost 3 months to fight from the beaches of Normandy to Paris. At a huge cost of life (on both sides). Despite being commanded by a lance corporal making not very sensible decisions, the flexibility of the German army was what it kept going. 

That's the modern translation despite the fact that the context makes it very clear that by definition, "Aethiops" was someone defined by having a dark skin. For thousands of years, "whitening the Aethiops" was considered the #1 idiom for "doing an impossible thing". One can't whiten a black because blacks are defined by their not being white. 

The official story is that the inscription is taken from Jefferson’s Notes on the State of Virginia, with the last two sentences being from a letter to George Washington. A manuscript. The quote isn't some black-and-white assertion against slavery. Thomas Jefferson had complex and evolving relationships with slaves. He owned lots of them (inherited some 135 of them), had a romantic relationship with one of them after his wife died (including kids), waived various fees, and was the key politician who banned importation of new slaves and then slavery itself in numerous states. It's just wrong to assume that a politician in the late 18th century should have behaved and acted like a radical social justice warrior in the 21st century. There is no contradiction between Jefferson's life and the inscription and Jefferson was an amazing politician and president who has improved the U.S. society dramatically. 

Peter Adamson's podcast The History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps recently did a summary of medieval thought on economics. I present a brief summary of this podcast episode; I'm not an expert on the subject, so any errors or oversimplifications below are almost assuredly mine and not Prof. Adamson's. He covers two main topics of interest to your question: merchants, and usury. Profit-making via trade As a background, Aristotle (in Politics) was disdainful of the notion of profit for profit's sake; he implicitly believed that all goods had an intrinsic value, and that exchanges that did not result in an exchange of equal intrinsic values were ethically suspect. Money was just a convenient method by which this intrinsic value could be measured, and the building of wealth was unnatural. However, by the medieval era, there was a growing recognition that "market price" was different from an object's intrinsic value. Thomas Aquinas (1225–74) and Henry of Ghent (1217–93) both accepted that a lack of supply of a good could lead a merchant to demand a higher price for that good, and that there was nothing ethically suspect about this. (Though Aquinas says it would be particularly noble if the merchant kept charging the customary price.) Many medieval European thinkers converged on the idea that money measured how "useful" an object was, either to the buyer & seller or to the community at large, rather than measuring its intrinsic worth. A recognition of the concept of "added value" was also present in some medieval thinkers. Duns Scotus (1266?–1308) defended the right of a merchant to buy an object at one place and sell it for more money at a distant place, since the merchant has taken a risk and invested labor in transporting these objects. All in all, medieval thinkers were generally of the opinion that there was nothing inherently unjust about money-making via trade, contrary to what Aristotle might have thought. Usury Usury was a trickier business. Renting objects, the providing of services, and usury also challenged the idea that value could attach only to material goods. In all of these exchanges, one party ends up with some extra money without losing anything of value themselves. For this reason, Aristotle & church doctrine viewed usury as wicked. Medieval thinkers came up with some reasons why this was so. Aquinas echoed Aristotle in the view that it is inherently unjust to demand more back from someone than one has given them. Another view was that the usurer was selling time to the borrower (in some sense), but time does not belong to anyone. Still, having a few money-lenders in your town did seem to be awfully useful, and a few medieval thinkers came up with ideas about money-lending that are closer to the view we have today. Durandus of Saint-Pourçin (1275?–1332) recognized the utility of money-lending but viewed it as an unseemly business, and suggested that the state should do it instead. Gerardus Odonis (1285–1349) recognized that the usurer is giving up more than just money; they are also taking a risk that it won't be repaid, and losing the use of the money for the period of the loan. However, he justified the ban on usury on the grounds that the borrower was in some sense being compelled to pay costs beyond the money that was being lent, and this compulsion was unfair. So in general, while medieval thinkers were beginning to recognize that that usury could make an economy function more smoothly, it was still viewed with distaste at best. 

Dando-Collins documents his work excellent. I'm not that good in formulating my question, likely. I'm not talking about centurions, they had a very different career path. Ordinary troops normal didn't have much of a career. They signed on as legionary, and usually retired not higher than imunes status. Making a career (as a common man) wasn't really an option in ancient times. Assume a legion was raised by Caesar. For example, Legio I Germanica was raised in 48 BC. We can assume that all/most regular legionary were raw recruits, the centurions came (of course) from other legions. Service time was about 12 years, so the surviving legionaries were paid of and retired to become evocati in 36 BC. How many retirees is not so important. As a new full legion it probably was about 4800 man strong. In those 12 years (later up to 25 years) lots of legionaries would die in combat, become medically unfit or died of natural causes. Probably anywhere between 1000 - 2000 legionaries would retire. That means about 2800 up to (in my example) 3800 man had to be recruited. I know each legion had its own area of recruitment, completely unrelated to where the legion was stationed. Recruiting officers recruited new legionaries there, and marched them to where the legion actually was stationed. Between 48 BC and 36 BC no additional troops were send to make up for the losses, according to Dando. At best the legate or governor could hire extra auxiliaries. That seems entirely plausible to me. But this would, in my opinion, be a very large drain on local manpower, which was necessary to grow food and be productive civilians. It's not a big deal for an area or province to supply a couple of hundred recruits each year. But supplying 2800-3800 strong young men is a lot. Even if it happens once very 12-25 years. It could affect the local economy seriously. That's what I try to find out.
