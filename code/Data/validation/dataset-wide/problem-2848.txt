I'm familiar with Hilberts formalism on mathematics, and how it's been useful there to open a space for mathematical objects though they are tied organically to the whole body of mathematical thought. It's never occurred to me that the objects that formalism could consider are outside of mathematics; but one person who did think that, apart from Frege, where he posited all logically consistent worlds - by a principle of plenitude - actually do exist; this is his notion of Plural Worlds; however it's worth noting when he announced this to his fellow philosophers there were many incredulous eyebrows raised but they let him get on with writing what he was thinking. In his plural worlds, there could be a world a god actually exists, in so far the traditional attributes of a god - omniscience, omnipresence etc - are logically consistent; and one might ask if there is a god in one world, is then there a god of all the worlds ... 

It's simply a case of misattribution, Gilchrists book has hardly anything to do with Nietzsche being mostly focused on brain physiology, so it's not unsurprising. Gilchrists narrative is simply a rewriting of Platos five forms of government; and how they move from Aristocracy to Tyranny, and this is confirmed when just after the quoted passage Gilchrist mentions political philosophy - not something that N is known for. 

You've hit upon one of the lines of thinking by Kant. In his thinking both options (1) & (2) are true; to Kant this suggests this is an actual contradiction, an antinomy in his language, and which is irresolvable; by us; one can say we are at the limit of thought, of the human capacity to reason - hence a critique of pure reason; establishing thus limits. Contradictions & antinomies in the main current of European philosophy are severely frowned upon; there is an assumption, perhaps since the Enlightenment that reason can solve all, that the world in its entirety is an ordered and intelligible whole. The mysterium tremendum has only be looked at in the proper fashion, in right spirit of sustained enquiry for it to reveal itself as less tremendous and less mysterious. We can suppose that the ontological tissue of the world, the fabric of reality is intelligible but we can also suppose by being finite creatures that we must then be epistemlogically finite; and between these two thoughts, which are separate thoughts and also the same thought is an antinomy; an antinomy that is nonetheless no less an antinomy for being dynamic. Kant declared himself a new Copernicus; who recentred Philosophy in a new orbit; he swapped the role of subject and object; time and space lose there object-ive character and become subject-ive; they are the forms of intuitions that the mind has such that it can experience at all; they are the conditions for experience; but by being the substrate of subjective experience they also retain their objective character; this appears as an antinomy, but it is a resolvable one. The phenomenal realm is both the objective and the subjective realm as normatively understood. Kant by outlawing noumena, by rendering it unspeakable and unsayable is outlawing the numinous. From Spinozas emanationist ontology he retains the mode of extension and of thought; the other modes, the infinity of them - the attributes of God and God himself are placed permanantly behind a veil. In Ghazalis Occasionalism; not only is God required to create the world; he is required to create it from moment to moment; or rather to sustain it; to propel it along through the dynamic of natural law - his law (we may also call it the law of Vishnu); thus also the law of cause and effect. Kant, in a Promethean move takes this out of the hands of God and into the mind of Man; but that part of the mind that is inaccessible to us; not Freuds unconcious; nor something lower; but something that is immanent to mind. Can one put time out of mind? One can certainly write the words... What was once a triad: Man - God - Object; is now a dyad: Man - Object; Kant banished God as once God banished man; then after the exile - execution: the Nietzschian gesture. 

Thus Hegel having died, and therefore having become merely (and morely) a concept, and then having assumed the life of a concept we see as a matter of empirical fact that this point of unintelligibility has been attained - and for analytical philosophers, this has made Hegel entirely opaque; his thinking has vanished leaving behind only a residue of pure immediate and indeterminate yet concretely physical text. For philosophers on the continent dismissal isn't enough, he must be killed; but being inopportunely already dead, it's his after-image, the image of his thought, that is his reputation that must be laid waste; and this as psychology has shown in its interrogation of the human and political requires neccessarily demonisation - for philosophers before they are reasoning beings, are also human beings with human weaknesses. Zizek, on the other hand wishes to rescue Hegel from Marxism, from over, under and indifferent interpretation; from being set aside to being made central - and this requires labour, and a special kind of labour - the labour of love. 

It relies on the fact that there are three dimensions of space. Any fewer, or more one can't find a front or back - though one can find analogues. 

Who do you think are actually tilling the soil, cutting the corn, stacking the haystacks, and feeding the horses that pull the plough? The Aristocracy, of which Corialanus is the exemplar of? Or the Plebians? The Plebians don't do any work in the drama itself, but one should use ones imagination here a little (with textual approbation). Or it might be worth looking at a history of the Roman Empire that actually goes into its economics and governance. 

Not experimentally; perhaps philosophically, that is with the aid of reason or logic. But then we may have more than one answer. 

I'm not sure that this is the best description about what prayer is about; for example, in the collection of Hadith by Al-Bukhari there is the following: 

Question: In Greek philosophy, it is generally taken that the line and the circle form a contrary. For example in Aristoteles Physics generally takes that motion can be formed out of this contrary, and this is affirmed in Newtonian Mechanics where the general motion of a body is decomposed into rotational and linear motions. In the Platonic dialogue, Parmenides, he defines the circle and straight line as: a. The round is that which all the extreme points are equidistant from the centre. b. The straight is that in which the centre intercepts the view of the extremes. In this picture, the straight line appears as a 'degeneration' of the circle; this to me at least appears implicitly, given the language that Parmenides uses; is there definite textual evidence that this is the case? 

Sin is different from crime: how? Is one a crime against God and his order; and the other a crime against Man (say a king, or a state) and his order? 

The specific examples seem to be about identity politics; and intellect and education doesn't change ones gender orientation or skin colour; so it might be better to examine where this is not an issue. For example let's take an example from literature; say: 

Supposing that God exists, supposing that nothing can be created out of nothing, then the world must be created out of God. That is the world is not apart from God. Famously Spinoza argues that the World was in God. Does he use some species of the argument above? But traditionally one speaks of God being the unique self-subsistent & neccessary substance - substance being a technical Aristotelian term. Is then world then made of Gods substance? But in particular Spinoza argued that the world was part of God in two attributes - of thought and of extension. 

But say we reverse this; that is take light not to be metaphorical but literally; then is it not, in rough terms, with Kant that it is the light of the mind thrown on the object that makes the the object visible to the subject and not the light thrown on it from some other - say the sun, or candle or a smoky oil-lamp? And one might note here, that Empedocles in early antiquity makes a claim that one instantly discounts: that the eye perceives an object because of the light sent out from the eye: 

In the context of mainstream mathematics it appears so. For example, take the real line. This is composed of extensionless points and the real line has extension. 

In Nyaya-Vaisesika atomic theory atoms are both considered to be both without magnitude and round. How is this possible? For anything to be round, it must have at least a non-zero radius which contradicts its extensionless. Is my conflation of extensionless with without magnitude the problem?
