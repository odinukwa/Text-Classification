My answer to you comes as an amateur boxer who has done both training to cut down body fat percentage, but also training to get in better shape to perform HIIT(which a boxing fight essentially is). would like to know the difference between cardio workout and fat burn workout. What is preferable in which case of training? Fat burn workout will have you working consistently over a longer time, but at a lower heartrate. It works the aerobic system which should burn fat. For example, if I want to lower my bodyfat percentage, I'll do long runs of maybe 10-12km every other day, at a steady pace(but quite slow, at least for me). On the other hand, cardio workouts are the opposite - you have a high heart rate and therefore work on the anaerobic system. This can be interval training(i.e. sprint 100m, jog very lightly next 100m, then spring next 100m), constantly pushing your heartrate to the maximum and calming down afterwards. Anaerobic exercises are so short in bursts that they do not per se burn fat, but rather carbs. Which is why, for example, a ketogenic diet is a nightmare for anyone doing sports that include HIIT exercises - you simply gas out almost instantly. To answer your question - if you want to burn fat, do aerobic exercises(long workouts at low heartrate). If you wanna improve anaerobic capability(HIIT capability), you do short bursts of intervals - it could be rowing, running, boxing.. Anything, really. And if it is preferable for someone with low body fat trying to build muscles Not that relevant, this is for conditioning purposes mostly. Muscle comes from either weight training or bodyweight exercises. Either aerobic or anaerobic training can support both. Depends on your end-goal. 

Rest it until it heals. Then, make sure you cut your nails as much as you can (but I guess you probably did that already). If that didn't help - everyone has different nails and for some it might still 'bite' - shifting your weight forward towards the first knuckle might help. 

The more area devoted to the body part, the better voluntary control you have over it. The motor cortex also shows a high degree of plasticity. That is, practice induces measurable changes in the brain: the area devoted to the specific body part increases, and control over a body part improves as a result. Amputees are a living proof of this. Some of them have developed the ability to carry out everyday tasks using their toes, even writing. However, should you spend time learning such skills? Most likely, not. Also, "getting aware of every muscle and learn to control them" is too generic to have any meaning. For example, the toes are extremely useful in balancing. (Try balancing on one leg with an injured big toe!) If you practice a lot of yoga poses balancing on one leg, your toes will develop the necessary skills to work together with the rest of your body to achieve balance. You, then, might become conscious of your toes working skillfully. This is probably what your teacher meant when she said it took her some time to control her pinky toe. She did not spend her time trying to "control every body part" separately. She has practiced specific skills, that were relevant and useful to her. For example, balancing, which involves the whole body, with the parts working together in harmony. Then, she became aware, that the parts, eg. the toes, have improved in their skill. 

You can do a lot of core exercises on these. Examples: Pullups/chinups on the high bar. On the two low parallel bars, you can do different variants of dips. Usually, there'll be a very low bar to lock on your feet - so you can do situps. And the ground layer is soft and nice(but firm), making it really good for pushups(rather than on concrete). Nothing too fancy, no. But a good amount of core bodyweight drills can be conducted with that setup :-) 

Unless you get a dexa scan or similar things conducted, bodyfat measure is at best something that can be done with, i dont know, a 5-10% deviation. You are likely not sub-10% bodyfat or even remotely close given your own description of your stomach. Either that, or you abs are widely underdeveloped. 

Ashtanga yoga and vinyasa flow styles are usually focused more on 'asana' (physical postures). This might be a good place to start: $URL$ There you can find tons of resources, reviews etc. On developing a home practice: $URL$ Book and DVD reviews: $URL$ Free practice ebook: $URL$ On strength: $URL$ 

Shoulders: take the kneeling push-up position. With the arms fully straight, push the floor away from you. Lift between the shoulder blades. Pull your shoulders down in the direction of your hips. Relax the neck and the face. All this should make your upper back a little round and lengthened, the chest muscles engaged. The same instructions apply for the plank. Hips: in the kneeling push up, make as if you want to pull your knees towards your shoulders (forward and up). Don't really move your knees, just make the effort. Breathe into your abdomen. This should lengthen the lower back and engage the core. The same instructions apply for the plank. Wrists and hand: spread the fingers and push them into the ground, as if you are trying to make a fist. 

Recently(3 months) joined gym, I am following diet and doing workout (mostly cardio). Till date i have lost 5-6 kg(85kg before), mainly following diet. That's decent weight loss and progress. Keep it up? Does i have injured my knee forever? Don't know. Go see a doctor. Also i have query whether i first lose weight then gain muscle or both goes hand in hand? Generally, you'd have periods of "cutting"(losing weight) and "bulking"(gaining weight). With the first, you aim at a calorie deficit, however not too big(because then you will lose muscle). On the second, you aim at a calorie surplus with a good macro balance(proportion of protein, good carbs and healthy fats) 

Unless you get proper coaching and feedback on technique, no. You will develop bad habits and likely hurt your hands/wrists by doing improper technique while working the bag. Hand wrap technique and proper gloves as well as boxing basics are needed, otherwise you have a high chance of hurting yourself. 

A calculator can be useful in figuring this out. Visit this link: $URL$ to calculate calorie burn based on your weight. 

My first piece of advice will be to avoid casein protein, as it has a high cancer risk associated with it. Going vegetarian isn't the best choice if protein is your goal. Eggs are your best bet for breakfast, assuming you use half (or less) of the yolk. Omelets, eggs on toast, scrambled eggs, etc. - Omelets are great because you can mix in all kinds of vegetables. Lunch - pack your lunch. Make a salad or a wrap. Dinner - Salmon, tilapia, tuna, steak, chicken, broccoli, cauliflower, black beans Right now your diet isn't very well-rounded. You may benefit from consulting with a nutritionist or tooling around with a diet building website like www.myfitnesspal.com.
