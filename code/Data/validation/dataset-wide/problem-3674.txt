The more moving parts, and the fancier the equipment is (ellipticals certainly qualify), the more a test drive makes sense. In contrast, if you are looking at a barbell and weights, those things are very uncomplicated in comparison and probably won't need a test drive. 

Rest. When it is no longer causing a lot of pain, you can start on the rehab. Compression and light work. It's better to do a lot of volume with low weight to get fresh blood flowing through the area to help speed healing. Slowly increase the intensity until you are back to your previous level of work. 

Most recently the culprit has been my knees traveling too far forward. I've had to dump attempts on the safeties I would normally be able to make because of the forward lean. Pause squats, video, and a good forum of knowledgeable people are invaluable tools. A pause squat is where you stay at the bottom position for a few seconds, then explode out of that position. If you don't where squat suits, this has much more carry over to your unpaused squats than box squats. Also, you usually have a much better feel for what's going on at the bottom. However, in your situation it could be that your upper back is rounding causing you to slump or do "squat-mornings" (combination squat and good morning) which is very hard on your body. If that's the case, you will need to strengthen your back to handle the load. 

Typically, one week isn't going to make or break you from a health standpoint. However, you can't sustain that pace for too long. Make sure your diet includes the following bare minimums: 

A Protein is considered: 2 whole eggs, 5oz land meat, 7oz seafood, etc. A Fat is considered: yogurt, cheese, butter, seeds/nuts A carb is considered: whole grains, starchy vegetables like potato or corn, etc. This is just one of many maintenance plans that will work. Essentially you'll be eating plenty of protein, plenty of veggies which are probably two of the most important parts of your diet. You'll also get your carbs and fats. The free day is meant to throw your body's metabolism off so it doesn't get used to your diet and start storing more. The no-carb day is there to correct for the extra calories you took in on the free day. Contrast that with the StrongLifts Diet, which is designed for weight lifters. A diet for weight lifters is going to have a lot more protein and fat. Also to deal with the increase of protein is a lot more water (minimum 1 US Gallon a day). On that diet you have 10% junk meals (4 junk meals a week). You'll be eating more, but only gaining weight if you eat a lot more. So as long as you are getting the protein and vitamins & minerals you need, the rest is up to you. While I have no data to back it up, I think it's a reasonable and good idea to allow for fun meals. If you monitor your weight weekly you should be able to get an idea if your weight is going up or down and adjust accordingly. My personal experience says that if I cut back on carbs for a day I can usually correct a 2-3lb increase (hint, it's not all fat if it came after just one free day/meal). I also find that if I slack on my water intake, my body holds on to weight a bit more. If I did gain a couple pounds of fat after a week on a cruise, I can still correct it easily by cutting carbs (so that my pancreas is secreting glucogon to help burn the fat for longer periods of time). 

Many of the exercises for smaller muscles are assistance exercises. By assistance, I mean that they are supplementary to the main compound lifts to either fix weaknesses or perform some rehabilitation. Particularly when you are a beginner, if you focus on the four main lifts: 

The biggest enemy of metal in the outdoors is moisture. That can come in the form of humidity, rain, dew, sweat, etc. When storing equipment outside you'll want to do your best to protect it from the elements: 

Unfortunately, spinlocks are what they are. When you don't change the weights on the dumbbells often, they are a great choice. However, when you change between sets or for different exercises it becomes a pain. That reason alone is why most gyms have a large selection of fixed weight dumbbells (also to get more people using the gym by helping you be quicker about your workout). You have some choices: 

Take a look at this article: The Athlete's Heart. Looking at your exercise regimen, I think you are more of an athlete than you realize. Just biking the 8 miles a day has you putting on at least 40 miles per week of aerobic exercise. The article states that with a heavy aerobic exercise regimen, the heart responds by lowering its heart rate, but increasing the volume of blood in each beat. With anaerobic exercise (weight lifting, other high intensity sports), the heart walls thicken to increase the blood pressure during exertion. These are normal affects, and the changes occur within the first 4-6 weeks of training. Also according to the article you should consult your doctor if: 

I also have some concerns about the volume here. There are some really strong folks who have a bit more economy in the weight room--even if their goals are size. Some of the guidelines that I've read from more than one source and I quite like are: 

Strength training can help you improve your relative strength, which is more important than your absolute strength for a running vertical--if you focus around the exercises that facilitate good jumping and don't get lost in the quest for heavier numbers. Rough guidelines would be to focus on things like these: 

So there are a few problems with blindly cutting calories. The first is you don't quite understand what your body needs, and how to address the problems causing you to be overweight. A common ailment in western food is the over-abundance of carbohydrates, sugars, and fats. So what problems does that cause? 

There are some loadable dumbbells where you have a compression collar to keep the weights in place. However, this doesn't necessarily make things better because it is trading one problem for another. In order to keep the collars small, they have a screw that you tighten to keep the collar in place. Believe it or not, spinlocks are an improvement and a quicker change than those. I'm not aware of any compression collars with a quick release like you can find on Olympic barbells that are small enough to work with most dumbbells. Part of the challenge is the threads on the spinlock dumbbell reduce the friction that the quick release collars depend on. If you know a machinist, they might be able to create something for you, but most people don't have that kind of resource. 

If I missed any major muscle groups, I apologize. When I focus on hypertrophy work I'm only partially in bodybuilder mode and I think more in terms of what helps me perform better at my sports. The routine has a combination of compound movements and isolation exercises. It's definitely designed with bodybuilders in mind. In order to make this work as well as possible, my recommendations are as follows: 

Stronglifts is a beginner program, and the heavier the lifts go, the more likely you will need to change something. There is nothing magical about 5x5. Starting Strength is by design 3x5 from the beginning. That said, please do review the material for what you are supposed to do on a stall in StrongLifts: 

Take a look at the StrongLifts 5x5 program. I just started it myself, and chose it because it was geared for the rank beginner. Starting with just the bar weight is much less intimidating than starting with a bunch of math and figures you just don't know (like your 1 rep max). In the first month you are learning form as your progressively increase weight--and you'll start getting to real work weights by month two. Choose rewards that further your fitness goals. When you get to milestones you've set for yourself (20lb loss, 40lb loss, etc.) instead of rewarding yourself with a decadent snack, buy yourself a heart rate monitor, or new running shoes, etc. Another fun and will be needed reward is new clothes. I found that at every 20lbs I lost a pant size. If you do weight lifting, you'll want higher amounts of protein in your diet, and fewer carbs. If you do running (which you can work up to) you will still need protein, but you'll also need more carbs as your heart rate is much higher than walking. Finally, when you get to your target weight: 

Adrenaline will help us temporarily boost the amount of strength we are using at any given time. The adrenaline response is engaged every time we lift weights, but also in fight or flight situations. It gives us that edge we need to go above our current abilities. Without the adrenaline response our muscle recruitment is very limited. One aspect that strength oriented weight lifters key in on is neurological recruitment. As you keep increasing weights when you work out, you are requiring that your body recruit more of the muscle into the lift as possible. By continuing to push that envelope, a strength trainer will exceed that 20-30% limit. Finally, because you've never demanded more than 20-30% of your strength from your muscles, your body has adapted itself to the lower level of muscle recruitment. You have to do work that requires more from your muscles in order to recruit more of them at a time. Someone who can squat 1000 lbs is using pretty near 100% of their strength--even when they are lifting geared (with squat suits). 

There is a lot of scaremongering by people who appear to know what they are talking about. I find that it is more useful to understand the what is meant by labeling carbs "good" or "bad" and what the end result is. The truth is that if I consume most of my carbohydrates using "good" sources (fruits, veggies, etc.) I will stay full longer and be less tempted to snack. However, if I consume nothing but "good" sources, I still get cravings for things that are typically considered "bad". At the end of the day it really matters that you find the right balance that helps you stay true to your diet.
