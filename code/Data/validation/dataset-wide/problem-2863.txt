Kant does not link his categories to innate abilities. But evolutionary epistemology (EE) does. In plain terms, EE aims at explaining Kantian ontogenetic a priori categories as phylogenetical a posteriori. That's a naturalistic approach to epistemology. Note. Several philosophers objected to Vollmer's theory, accusing him to ignore the philosophical question why the categories are valid. See Vollmer, Gerhard: Evolutionary epistemology (Originally German 1975). I did not get what you mean by the "developmental aspect of mind-body problems". If you mean *developmental psychology", then the answer is "No": Kant did not consider the question how children develop their mental concepts or the mind-body scheme. Kant's focus was the educated, rational adult. 

Advocates of free will differ how strict they interpret these criteria. The contra-position to a libertarian view is a deterministic view. Our subjective and conscious experience conforms to a libertarian view. But the only scientific view (neuroscience), which I consider to have the ability to explain the phenomenon, is a deterministic one. For the whole issue see e.g., Walter, Henrik: Neurophilosophy of Free will. (2001) 2) Of course we are influenced by outside factors. Most of all we are influenced by our previous experiences with our fellow men and with the physical world. In a given situation we do not just react to external stimuli. Instead our reactions depend also on our internal state. The latter is determined by what we have learnt and experienced. Being totally independent in our decisions would not mean to decide but to play at dice (random choice). 

In science one observes a phaenomen or one prepares an experiment. Stated in a bold way, the experiment is the question of the scientist, and the result of the measurement is the answer from nature. A construct is an idea in the mind of the scientist; hence neither the measurement nor its value are constructs. 

The list of emotions comprises fear, anxiety, pleasure, joy, contempt, disgust, curiosity, hope, disappointment, expectation, exaltation, depressiveness. Emotions are flexible (emotional conditioning): There is no fixed attachment which links a certain experience with a set of emotions. E.g., some people experience pleasure about a certain movie while others feel disappointment. From a biological point of view, one can ask for the function of linking experiences with emotions, i.e. for the utility of emotions. One answer is that emotions serve as a marker of stored experience. As a consequence, in a new situation we have quick access to our stored experience by activation of the corresponding emotion. Hence also emotions are useful. One can discuss whether from a biological point of view intrinsic value exists at all. Of course, the viewpoint of biology is only one possible approach. At least since the Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle a professional conversation has been conducted about values and the question whether an intrinsic value exist as a final guide of life. 

Nevertheless, economic reasons do not play any role in those scientific revolutions Kuhn envisages. Also sociological issues are not the trigger of scientific revolutions. Hence I would not press Kuhn's reasoning into a Marxist concept of revolution. 

Such a unitary view is named monism. In general, adherents of monism face the problem to reduce one type of entities, either the material or the spiritual entities, to the other type. A monistic position, which considers fundamental the spiritual entities, is Advaita-Vedanta. Shankara, the main proponent of this type of monism, considers real the spiritual world and an illusion the material entitities, i.e. the physical world. A opposite monistic position is taken by d'Holbach, who considers fundamental the physical entities. d'Holbach considers our mental capabilities as properties of our physical components. A third alternative of monism would be to consider both types of entities resulting from a third, fundamental type of entity. You find more on the different variants in $URL$ IMO, it is very difficult to explain the multitude of phenomena by a monistic approach. I am not convinced by any proposed monistic model. Instead I tend to the view: We need at least two irreducible concepts, one being a concept from physics like energy, the other one a concept from information theory like the concept of information. Both types of entities interact by a series of processes. 

Formal reasoning is an important tool to make subtle differences transparent and explicit. This can be a prerequisite to assess the validity of certain argumentations. E.g., the correct definition of continutiy of a function "f" at an argument "X_0" is 

Has the monadology of Leibniz any influence on contemporary philosophy? Note. I do not ask about its historical importance but about its present influence. 

a definition which relates to our common understanding and use of these terms. Notably, the definition should determine how both terms relate to each other. His running example is the word water. He designs a fictious world, called Twin Earth, with a liquid different from H2_O, which nevertheles is indistinguable from water on earth - as long as no chemical analysis is made. The inhabitants of the fictious world name their liquid water alike to us, who name water our liquid on earth . Putnam proposes to distinguish the meaning on earth of the word water from the meaning on Twin Earth of the word water. Because the extensions of the word are different on earth and on Twin Earth. In short, he proposes to express the meaning of 'meaning' to be a normal form which comprises four components. Accordingly, the normal form of the word water is: 

Because your questions also refers to religion: Religious studies, with its subfields Psychology of religion and Sociology of religion, investigate religions from a scientific point of view. 

Relation between truth and counterexample: A statement is true if and only if no counterexample exists. The term "potential" is superfluous. Tautology: A tautology is a statement which is true independently from the truth-value of its components. Example: "X or not X" is true independently from the truth value of the variable X. Vacuous truth: A statement which is true, because it refers to the empty set. Example: All kings of France in the 20th century had red hair. 

The claim from the quote is a bit unprecise. A proposition is disjunctive if and only if it is composed of two or more statements connected by or. Apparently, the example presents a disjunctive proposition. Even more, it is the special case of two component statements where each is the opposite of the other. In formal terms "A or B" with B = non A. According to 2-valued logic either "A" is true or "non A" is true. And a disjunctive statement is true if and only if at least one of its components is true. Hence by trivial reason, the compound statement " A or non A" from the example is true. But that does not give you any information. Because the compound statement is true due to formal reasons alone, independent from the content of "A", i.e. nothing is asserted. But a general disjunctive proposition, e.g., "He came yesterday or the day before" makes a positive assertion: 1. He came and 2. It was on one of two possible days. 

My short answer is: You are right, nothing counts as true without being supported by logic or empirically verifiable data. In the second approximation I would like to make the following refinement: Truth is a property of propositions. In general, the truth of mathematical propositions can be proved - neglecting the issue of undecidable propositions. In the field of natural science general propositions are hypotheses. We cannot prove them, but we can either confirm or falsify them. Hence your term "support" has a different meaning in both cases. Note. In my opinion, Corts examples concerning "gut instinct" and "flash of inspiration" from the beginning of his answer do not relate to the objective property of truth but to the subjective property of certainty. 

1) Nietzsche applies the term hubris in his short reflection on Heraclitus in his early essay "Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks", section 6. Nietzsche quotes a Greek proverb "Fullness creates iniquity (hubris), Sattheit gebiert den Frevel (die Hybris)". 2) As far as I know Nietzsche does not apply the term hubris to superman in "Thus Spoke Zarathustra". Superman is always estimated in a positive sense. 3) Of course hubris is discussed in classical Greek texts, e.g. Odyssey: Book 12, 374f, Solon: First Elegy, Sophocles: Aias, Sophocles: Oedipus Rex (verse 873f), Euripides: Hippolytos (= Stephanephoros). 4) Concerning Oedipus Rex: I do not consider him committing iniquity (= hybridsein). I consider the remarks of the choir (verse 873ff) referring to hubris and justice (= dike) general remarks, not aiming at Oidipus in particular. In my opinion, Sophocles lets Oidipus perish because there is a curse on his house. Even the rational attitude of Oedipus cannot save him from the curse. 

To process this sample I do not expect much benefit neither from Aristotle's concept of essence (ousia) nor from system theory. The latter deals with dynamic physical or sociological systems and the interactions of their components via agents. But philosophy is a theoretical domain with many conflicting subdomains. It is not a system which settles the conflicts in a stable balance. On the other hand, if your question aims at the philosophy of Schelling, it would be helpful to edit the question such that this restriction becomes clear already from the title. 

The quote is from Book 5, Med. 26 from Aurelius, Marcus: Meditations. Sympathtic link is the translation of the Greek word "συμπάθεια" (sympatheia = sympathy). The whole sentence shows that Aurelius considers a tight link between soul (= psychae) and body (= soma). Hereby the body can affect the soul. Aurelius characterizes this link as sympathy. 

I will consider "true" a property of a propositions. Then the correspondence definition of "true" reads: 

Your question touches several issues: 1) Physics cannot "figure out the ultimate truth": We do not know whether an ultimate truth exists. One can even doubt that the concept of an ultimate truth is a meaningful concept. Physics advances step by step, without knowing whether these steps lead to the top of the pyramid or the terrain gets wider and wider with every step. New results prompt new questions. Secondly, physical theories are always hypotheses, one cannot prove general physical theories. Notably, scientific hypotheses can be confirmed or refuted, but not proved. 2) Currently, mainly two different opinions exist about the Big Bang. One group states as you write: "Big Bang created space-time, it's idiotic to even consider the notion 'before the Big Bang'". They are right as long as they work within the standard model of cosmology where extrapolation back in time leads to the distinguished limit point of Big Bang. Another group investigates a cyclic universe by applying methods of quantum gravity to cosmology. Here Big Bang does not exist as a singularity. See Bojowald, Martin: Once Before Time: A Whole Story of the Universe (2010) 3) Probably you are not satisfied with these answers. But presently, physics has to leave open the decision between the two models. And until now, physics had always to leave open certain questions. I doubt whether physics will find a final theory which satisfies every need articulated by metaphysics. 

I do not know a well-known scientist who at the same time is a professional philosopher. Can you imagine a contemporary professor who has a chair in a science department and also in the philosophical department of a renowned university? There are only a few scientist who have a PhD in physics or biology and also in philosophy. Possibly you find some neuroscientists who are active in both science and philosophy, e.g. Gerhard Roth from Germany. From a more general point of view I see a big difference between philosophy and science: Different than philosophy science builds on empirical data. And science always strives to check a scientific theory against empirical data. Today philosophy of nature does not contribute any longer to scientific progress. And philosophy of science exists as a meta-theory, but often it is not taken seriously by working scientists. In my opinion, todays philosophers are not familiar with the results of modern science; not even with the fundamental theories from 20th century. E.g. the concept of spacetime as developed by the Theory of Relativity has hardly entered into the philosophical discussion in the field of metaphysics. Summing up: Philosophy and science do not merge today. And I do not see any reason why they should do so in the future. Added. To avoid any misunderstanding due to language: By "science" I mean "natural science" in my answer. 

I do not see that Sophocles in "Oedipus Rex" takes an adverse stance against the Greek myths. First, because I could not name any passage which supports the claim. Secondly, because the Greeks of the 5. century BCE considered most of their myths as real as we today consider historical events. In any case the sphinx does not represent the world of the Olympic gods. At best, it represents the chtonic goddess. The Olympic gods are represented by Apollon who is highly estimated by Oedipus. Oedipus is the paradigm of a rational man. He is convinced that rational investigation can answer - and possibly solve - all problems. But according to Sophocles the scope of rational investigation in human life is limited. I prefer to read the play, written at about 430 BCE, as a reply to the Greek enlightenment initiated by the sophistic philosophers of this time. You recall that Freud created the term Oedipus complex from this play. Iocaste expresses this thought (verse 981f.): How oft it chances that in dreams a man Has wed his mother! 

First, you can bring the type of argumentation of your opponent to the extreme: If it is the goal to solve all life’s problems, than the most effective and enduring way is to extinguish life itself, i.e. to kill all living beings. Possibly this consequence makes your opponent a bit reflective about his type of reasoning. Secondly, persons concerned will not agree that violence is the general solution for life’s problems. Violence means civil war. Nobody likes civil war because everybody feels unsafe in civil war. In addition, civil war does not stabilize society but destabilizes life for all persons concerned. Thirdly, I do not expect that violence can be banned from society. This conception seems utopical to me. Therefore I consider it necessary to domesticate violence. And this means that public institutions like UNO for international affairs and police for intrastate affairs should obtain a monopoly on violence. The scope of this monopoly should be fixed by written laws. And last, I do not think that an ultimate justification for banning violence can be derived from ethics, because I do not know any ultimate justification in ethics.
