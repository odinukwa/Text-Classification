I would tell your coach where you are sore then have them give you specifically watch your form during your training and during your races. It could be that your form is great when you are strong but as you tire it degrades and you are overcompensating on one leg. This will cause your other leg to work less. This would explain the imbalance. I would also add that many high school runner start in August and sometimes will over train. If you haven't run all summer then I would tell your coach so they know that you need to build some base to get ready for you season this fall. 

I Average 40 miles per week for running and ramping up to a marathon I peak at 60 miles. After the marathon I take two weeks off. The normal rule I go by is 10% for milage increases, but I am wondering how a base plays into that? Can I go back to 40 miles a week? How long and how fast can I go back to that? 

Since you are a scientist you should structure your runs so that they match your fitness test. For example, the training needed to run 42k in 3 hours is much different than running 5k in 16 minutes. A marathon runner has one goal and 100m Sprinter has another goal. You can't train the same for both distances. I am assuming the distance you need to run is "Shorter" probably 1k to 2k? Since we are assuming that you have to run a "Shorter" distance I would focus on building your speed and stamina using a 5k training plan. There are many 5k training plans that will get you to a goal is 8 weeks and most of these plan involve running at least 4 days a week. You should do at least one speed workout that involves running fast for a certain distance then a short recovery. Try starting with 400m in 2 minutes or less, then walk for one minute. If you goal is only speed then do this twice a week with easy runs in between. Start with 6x400m and work up from there as you feel better Your easy day runs should be a 5k run and try to finish. Theoretically should should finish in 30 minutes. Try to do one run on the weekend that is 60 minutes. In the beginning you will walk/run but at your current pace you should finish 10k in one hour. 

You could treat this similar to running and fuel every 40-60 minutes depending on the duration of your climb. 2 hours is the max I would normally running without a Gel or something so you could eat something halfway. You have the advantage of being able to digest a little more normally since your HR will be lower than a runner so you can look at other fuel options (like an Ultra runner would take) You can also look at Tailwind Nutrition if you simply want a supplement to put into your water bottle. $URL$ This will give you energy as well as hydration throughout your climb 

Strava should cover all these items. You choose to only share data you want to share $URL$ It also has HR monitors that will work with your iPhone I share all my data but you can keep everything private if you want. There is a free and a paid version. $URL$ 

First you should make sure you are not over doing in in your training, but having said that if your long run is at 13 miles then yes you can do a Marathon in 15 weeks. Ideally you want 16-18 weeks for training, but if you are already running 13 miles in sub 2 hours you are in decent shape. You should look at a Marathon training plan with a goal of around 4 hours. Look at you 1/2 marathon time and punching in the numbers $URL$ you should finish in 4:02 which is a respectable number. You only need to remember that 13 miles is much easier than 26 miles and you really learn how you feel after 20 miles. (The real half way point!) If you look at this plan, $URL$ then you are already a quarter of the way there. Just be careful not to ramp up you milage to quickly or you could get injured. Remember to practice you fueling and hydration during your weekend long runs. 

Full Disclosure: I am a programmer and sit at my computer all day. I do have a treadmill desk but I forget to use it! To answer your question: You should not be working out the same muscle groups back to back. You should work different muscles on each work out and have a rotation to do so. The same is true for running, you shouldn't do a two hard workouts back to back, you should have a rest or easy day in-between. In your case, if you want to do a 6 day schedule it might look something like this Day 1 - Hamstrings And Deadlifts Day 2 - Chest Day 3 - Back Day 4 - Shoulders Day 5 - Quads Day 6 - Arms Day 7 - OFF You can workout everyday, just work a different part of your body Of course you can Google and find a plan that fits, or if you are at a gym they will have plans for you. 

You should consider incorporating Running, Biking, Swimming and Weights into your program. The following schedule could be used, but you can change things up as you need to. You can find a 4 day weight program online to do your individual exercises. Monday Swim: 30 minutes Run: 30 minutes Weights: Legs 1 Tuesday Bike: 30 Minutes Weights: Chest / Shoulders Wednesday Bike: 30 Minutes Run:30 Minutes Thursday Swim 30 minutes Weight: Legs or arms Friday DAY OFF Saturday Bike: 30 minutes Weights: Back Sunday Run: 30 minutes 

As a Dad of two cross country runners I have seen the late summer enthusiasm turn to shin splints and stress fractures. I would recommend slowing adding onto your running volume. Remember that speed is a small part of your workout routine and running fast alone is not the only thing. You should have easy days following your hard days as well as one day were you spend sometime doing a long slow distance. This will get your body used to the volume and help to prevent injury in the future. You should ask your Cross Country coach if you can join the team now, they should give you some guidance and structure to help you ramp up and you will also get to compete! If you already do 8k in 30 minutes you will do 5k in 18 minutes which means you will also letter! 

Most tracks are 400m so on the inner lane one lap would be 400m. As you go out the distance is farther There also should be markings on the track for 100,200,300,400 and 1 mile 

This is a great question and one that I went through a number of years ago. The first thing I would do is caution you on the amount of mid-foot running you try to do. If you don't slowly adjust to doing this you will get many new injuries. Calf, Solious, Achilles, Plantar fascia. It needs to be a slow systematic approach. The first thing you can do is concentrate on running slow and keeping track of your form. The first exercise that I would do is practice leaning forward then stepping. Let your feet catch you. This will force you to land on the balls of your feet (or midfoot). You can do this for 25-50m at a time. Once you get used to this sensation you can try 1km runs by making yourself run on your midfoot. Again, keep them slow. The slower you go, the less impact you will have on the other parts of your body that you haven't been using very much. Make sure you have your hips under your body, you should be slightly forward but not much. Concentrate on landing smooth and don't worry if you hit your heel a little. The next thing is shoes. If you have a running store that will give you a gait test you can have them video you. Make sure you tell them your goals. You can try running once a week in something like Vibrams, or it maybe safer to run in Newtons. Newtons will give you the cushion when you do heel strike while also forcing you to the balls of your feet. Once you get your technique down you can choose a shoe with very little heel to toe drop. Maybe 4mm. This will be a slow process, concentrate on form first, then speed. If you are running out of breath to soon then take walk breaks. Eventually your walk breaks will become fewer and fewer! I found this article was helpful on changing your running form $URL$ 

Nate: Here is what I would do. Bring your running clothes to work along with your running shoes. On the days you plan on running home you can change into your running cloth before you leave and then run any distance or section that you want. If you are already riding 40-50km you should be able to run/walk 4k. As you get more used to running this distance you can increase your pace and change your route around a little. If you need to bring cloths home then you could get a running backpack which would allow you to carry some limited items. You want to get a back that sits high on your back and has a strap across your chest and your waist. For shoes you should go to a running store and have them fitted. 

I do a lot of long distance running and I normally take a gel if I am racing and it goes longer than 2 hours. (Like a Marathon) My question is for tennis would I get the same benefit? For example, a tennis match could last 2-3 hours. Would taking a gel every 40-50 minutes help mitigate cramping and give me some energy later in the match? 

Training for a marathon is a hard and feeling tired is normal. However the more you train the better you will start to feel. I trained for my first marathon with 4 runs a week, but I did find that I was tired and I also got injured. This was mainly due to adding to much mileage too quickly. I am assuming that you were on week 3 (20k) of your plan and that you are taking your rest days. You should also be doing your long run in the morning to best represent your marathon start time. Your meal the night before and even two days before should be heavy with carbs. You should be drinking plenty of water during the run. It is possible that you are dehydrated and your muscles can not properly recover, it is also possible that you are adding mileage to quickly. Your LSD run should also be 35% of your total mileage for the week. So if you run 20k on your LSD run then the rest of the week should be about 40k. It is ok to rest and this is important so perhaps you need two days after you LSD run to recover. The good news: You are young! Your body recovers much quicker than older runners. My advice: Join a running group that is training for a marathon. Drink water and get lots of rest. 

I would like to Cross Country Ski this winter as cross training for my next Marathon. My question is if I can ski for a number of hours and will this impact my normal run training? My last marathon I ran 50-60 miles per week but I would like to add some other exercise types to my next cycle of training. Do I need more than one complete rest day or can I run a long day then ski for a number hours? 

To start off you should be doing a lot of dry land training now. i.e. running, if you have roller skies you should be using them now. For a 42-50k Ski race I would consider running at least a half-marathon running race. You should be cross training throughout the summer months. We bought a pair V2 and OneWay roller skies here $URL$ You can also rent roller skies for the season. This is a great resource for training ideas $URL$ More resources $URL$ Here are training programs. $URL$ For advanced technique I would consider taking some ski lessons. We live in the Twin Cities and there are some great coaches and teachers along with groups you can join. We have a number of groups that meet on Meetup.com. 

Everyone body behaves differently to temperature and humidity, but you can look at the "Heat Index" If the heat index is high enough then you know that you will have to adjust your pace for the race. For example: If you are running a Marathon at 90f and 90% humidity the heat index will be 122. If the temp is 80 and the humidity is 40% then the heat index is 80. $URL$ I don't think you will have a problem when the temp is lower than 70f. Most heat index chart start at 75-80f. For the "Ideal" temp it is what your body can handle. The higher the temp and humidity the more you should adjust your pace.
