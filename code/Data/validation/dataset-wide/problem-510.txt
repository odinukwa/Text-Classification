If you drop a styrofoam ball and the same size rock ball in a vacuum they will fall exactly the same. It's because they accelerate with the same gravitational acceleration. While falling both transform their potential energies into kinetic energies, so: Mass x Grav_accel x Height = 1/2 x Mass x Velocity^2 We can see it does not matter how much weight the object has, because the Mass is on both sides of equation. The Velocity is only proportional to Height so both objects fall the same. Now if you drop them in air environment - both objects will have to overcome air drag. The air drag is not dependent on the Mass of object but only on it's shape, velocity, and the environment. If both objects would fall the same, they would both need the same energy to overcome the air drag. This energy is taken from the kinetic energy of the object to push the air molecules out of the way. But because the heavier object has bigger potential energy from the start (and bigger kinetic energy in the end) the air drag takes relatively smaller part away from the kinetic energy. Mass x Grav_accel x Height = 1/2 x Mass x Velocity^2 + 1/2 x Velocity^2 x Some_constant This is why the heavier object falls faster in drag environment. Now if the objects have same density and one is bigger heavier and the other is smaller and lighter: Air drag depends on the drag_coefficient which largely depends on the Cross section. Mass (when the density is constant) depends on the Volume. Volume of sphere is: 4/3 x π x r^3, Cross section of sphere is π x r^2 This means the Mass increases 1.33 x radius times faster than Cross section for bigger objects, giving them falling advantage. Thats why dust of the same material falls very very slowly and chunks of the same material fall fast. 

No. It absolutely isn't. You know what happens when an umbrella catches the wind. Imagine that on an unstable device doing 30 mph. Even without wind the rain will be blowing in your face most of the time so you'd have to place the umbrella right in front of you for it to offer any kind of effective shielding from the rain. How are you supposed to see anything with an umbrella in front of you? Even a transparent one will be rain-soaked and impossible to see through. And that's not even considering the fact that you've got one hand off the handlebars all the time. How are you supposed to signal a turn if you only have one hand on the handlebars anyway? And God help you if a child runs into the road in front of you and you need both hands to apply sufficient braking. You shouldn't even consider it. Get a rain coat. 

I'd recommend giving your current brake installation a good service before considering spending money on an expensive upgrade. Hydros are great (I have them on my bike and enjoy riding with them), but a well-maintained braking system should be more than adequate in all reasonable riding conditions. Hydros would have advantages if you're into mountain riding as a sport, but for day-to-day use you probably won't notice much difference. You say you've never changed your pads because they work. A pad can last a good while to be sure, but they do tend to become gradually less effective as they wear (more force for the same braking needed). You might want to look into changing the pads for fresh, good quality ones. That should give an noticeable increase in breaking power. Similarly, the discs or rims that the pads press against can wear, though that's very unlikely to be a factor unless the brakes in question are very old. What is more likely to have an impact is dirt and other contaminates on the braking surface. Mud and dirt, lubricating oil from your bike, the remains of old brake pad material and what have you can build up on the surface. If you clean the surface thoroughly then you should notice further improvements in the stopping power of your brakes. The cable in mechanical systems can stretch, fray, rust and so on. As it's a mechanical moving part it also needs to be properly lubricated. As the cable stretches with use you should adjust the brakes to counter. You should also apply some kind of lubricating grease or wax to the exposed portions of the metal cable with the brake in both the released and applied state. Finally, if there's any sign of rust or fraying in the cable, get it replaced immediately! All this maintenance should make a very noticeable improvement in the stopping power of your brakes. More effective braking means less effort needs to be used when braking, and hopefully less strain being put through your hands. You may also want to invest in a good pair of padded cycling gloves, they also offer a measure of protection from strain on your hands. If none of the above helps enough then that's the point where you might want to start seriously looking at replacing your brakes. However, doing the above is likely to be effective in reducing the amount of effort you need to apply when braking, and it's a lot less expensive then replacing the brakes on your current bike. 

On a wheel stand there is not much resistence so the motor doesn't have to use much torque (current) to spin the wheel, so the power draw is that low. The motor outputs max power at half it's rpm range: 

The other thing is the power rating itself. The power quoted is input power and not the mechanical motor output. This is because the motor controller is an integral part of the system and runs as an inverter. the mechanical motor output + the heat the motor produces = input power To see how much power you can get onto the ground you need to use dyno again or you can get a datasheet of the motor and look up the efficiency curve. 

Well there is only one rule - adjust your speed to the situation. Doesn't matter if it's falling rocks, a sudden animal crossing road, people, deaf/earphone people, kids, oil on road behind corner... You don't even have to use noises to notify people - it usually surprises them and they make sudden moves. Just pass them at safe distance with safe speed (I would pass elderly with greater speed than kids, because it's not likely they will move quickly into your trajectory). Use your prediction and treat everything the same - have a total control what's around you and what can intersect your path, no matter what it is. 

Why greater rotor puts more stress on fork (no matter how and where the caliper is mounted) from physics point of view: Friction depends on the materials touching and the force they are pushed together. The materials depend on the quality of rotor/pads. The force depends on how hard you can squeeze the brake lever and also on quality of the brake (caliper design, brake hose strength against stretch, brake fluid, etc.). So given a brake and given how strong your fingers are the brake's maximum friction force it is able to generate is always the same. Now - the further the braking point is from the center of rotation the more leverage there is and the greater braking torque can be achieved. Higher braking torque puts more stress on the fork. The other thing and non-relevant is if you can use all that braking torque. That depends on the weight of the rider, the tire (contact patch and tire tread), and the ground (asphalt, gravel, mud, ice,..). 

I have flown 6x with my bike (Cyclocross Disc) in a soft padded bike bag and never once had issues with the rotors. Numerous other MTB friends never remove the rotors either and have not had trouble when flying. Echoing the comment by @Daniel, I'd be more focussed on the dropouts and RD and making sure those are supported. You are way more at risk stripping / losing screws than bending a disc. The wheels will be double padded by the wheel bag and the bike bag. 

I know you can use a junction port (ie: SM-JC41 Internal Junction Box B) for this, but are there any Male to Female extension cables? Root Cause: R600 to 5 port junction for a TT setup near the base lever (Magura's so can't use the standard integrated TT brake/shifter) 

The geometry is the major problem with converting a road bike into a TT/Tri bike, road bikes have you sitting much farther back relative to the contact points on the handlebars. You may be able to offset this with a different seatpost that puts you farther forward (assuming saddle is adjusted all the way towards the front). Other changes may include a shorter stem, different saddle. You may be able to make your road bike work, just don't expect to be comfortable mid ride switching from the aerobars to the hoods/drops. You have to pick one and stick with it. 

Not sure why it hasn't been mentioned in the other answers but recumbents are generally much heavier than traditional frames and on steep gradients weight makes a big difference. Looks like a 2000$ recumbent is around 30lbs and a 2000$ road bike should be around 18lbs or so. 

An optional extra that would come in handy and for future work on the bike would be a bike workshop stand I spent 100$ on mine and it has been excellent for regular maintenance and upgrading parts. 

Visijax make a high-visibility cycling jacket that also includes battery-powered indicators. It may be the way to go, at least in winter, if you don't mind looking like a bit of a prat. $URL$ 

I have been looking around for information on this topic but can't find anything definitive. The tram routes through Manchester city centre are for trams (obviously), but it seems public transport can use the tramways as well. My understanding is that is legal for cyclists to use bus lanes, so does the same apply to the tram routes? I also seen people cycling on the tramways, but are they actually allowed to do so? Just because people are doing it doesn't make it legal after all, as plenty of people cycle on the pavements as well (which in Manchester is a special kind of stupidity given how busy the streets are!) Is there any official policy on the status of the tramways as cycle routes? I do know that Metrolink are rather hostile to cyclists, and I certainly wouldn't want to lose an argument to a tram whilst on a bike... 

I got a spare inner tube with my bike, which is good. I checked how it was packed and found it was sticking somewhat when I pulled it out of the box, which I can only imagine is bad. Would it be an idea to put someething on the tube for storage, talcum powder maybe? 

The clue's in the name. BIKE lane! If you see cars doing this, especially if you're being bullied by antisocial car drivers, I'd recommend taking notes of license plates and having a few friendly chats with the police. Realistically that probably wouldn't achieve much, but you never know. 

I'm quite pleased with my 2012 Jamis Durango bike, I think it would fall into the $1000 range from the UK price I paid for it. It's a hardtail, if that puts you off, but I personally feel I prefer that to the full-suspension bikes I've tried (admittedly cheaper, made of steel, heavier and crappier). 

The new Shimano Ultegra R8000 Cassette 11-34 fits the 11spd MTB freehub spacing. If you have the medium cage 5800 derailluer it will work as is. If not then you can upgrade to the R8000 medium cage and it will work with your 5800 shifters. 

Get a power meter and see what output you are getting at various rpm / loads. There is a big difference of 120rpm at 200w or 600w. This relationship will most likely not be linear. 150 rpm seems much too high, but everyone is different. I personally find great power at 105-120. Timing yourself or using HR can be a measure as well, but power is the only way to know for sure. 

There is no video editing software from Shimano. The CSV is present, you should see it if you paired your sensors in the mobile app. I have used DashWare with success with my Shimano action camera, others have reported Garmin VIRB edit software works but I have not tried. 

The ANT+ lights standard allows for "0" switches to turn on/off bike lights. (Besides the initial power on of the head unit) I run a bontrager flare rt with my edge 820 and it works great. Completely wireless, it automatically adjusts brightness, and even has a "brake light mode". 

Mind you, with top of the line brand new components it is much easier than potentially old and rusty equipment. 

A road groupset usually consists of a number of parts. There are not many tools, and they are generally not that expensive. With all the resources out there (youtube, sheldon brown website, etc) and basic mechanical aptitude it isn't a difficult task. You need basic hand/bike tools, (hammer, metric allen keys/drivers, screwdrivers, pliers, socket set, torque wrench, etc) In terms of specific tools for those components: 

It sounds like it's only superficial damage if it's only happened since the frame's paint got damaged. If you can get it all off with steel wool then you should be fine, though you may want to look into getting the frame repainted with a good waterproof/anti-rust paint. As for the creeking, verify that the bolts holding the front fork and handlebar assembly are nice and tight. It's probably just something working loose with use. 

If a chain gets sufficiently worn, it will start inflicting wear damage on the chainrings and sprockets (in extreme cases, causing the teeth to take on a hook shape). This wear will cause problems with gear changes and pedalling, and your only option at that point is an expensive replacement of a significant portion of the drive train (You'll probably need to replace the chainrings, sprockets and cassette, and possibly your deraileurs as well if you can't get parts compatible with the current ones). If you're lucky, your deraileurs just need tuning. Badly aligned deraileurs can cause all kinds of issues, but they should go away if you can sort the alignment out. There's a couple of adjustment screws you can use to calibrate the gear shift. Keeping your chain in good working order and replacing it quickly when it starts showing signs of wear is important, because chains are one of the cheapest parts of the drivetrain and can cause very expensive damage if worn or damaged chains aren't replaced quickly. 

Here's an experiment you can try that we used to do in high school Get an empty coke can with no dents or other disfigurements in it, place it upright on the ground, and stand on top of it. It should be able to bear the weight of most adults with normal body mass. Now put a small dent in the can and try it again. But be careful because the small dent will introduce a weakness into the can and it will almost certainly buckle under your weight this time. Obviously a bicycle frame is made from much thicker gauge aluminium than a coke can, but the same basic principles hold. A tube is an inherently strong structure, but only if it remains true. You put a dent into it, you put a region into the structure where stresses will concentrate and try to deform the tube further. In the short term, it should be fine, but I suspect the lifespan of the tube would now be measured in months rather than years, as aluminium is a softer metal than steel and is more prone to metal fatigue (alumimium always suffers from stresses that will begin fatigue damage no matter how small the load, according to wikipedia). You also have to consider that there may be other items of less obvious damage, such as small cracks opening up in welds that are small enough to remain hidden by the paint. Fatigue will set in at these points as well. If you do keep riding on this frame then I'd suggest monitoring the crash damage region very closely. Also, don't go mountain biking on a frame in that state! Stick to the roads. And stick to quiet roads where you're unlikely to hit anything else and ones with no potholes, because another big impact or bump could make the frame fold up like a book at the dent. As for repair, I suspect the only realistic option is to completely replace that tube. Given how difficult aluminium is to weld I expect the cost of doing that would approach the cost of an entire new frame anyway, and given the frame already has some miles on it and will have accumulated some wear and tear it will not have the life expectancy of a new frame. I think realistically, your only option is to put that frame out to pasture.
