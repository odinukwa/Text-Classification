Something else worth mentioning is that metals are held together by electrons. If you are throwing them out the back of your engine to move your spacecraft, you may run out of them on your spacecraft! This will eventually result in the metals weakening. I haven't done the math on how long this takes, but it may be a concern for longer voyages. You also have to worry about electricity discharging when your spacecraft touches another - both will have changed electric potential at different rates, so there will be a voltage between them. This could actually be pretty cool, as a spacecraft descending into an atmosphere could sanely be described as "surrounded by bolts of lightning" as the static dissipates. 

I'd go for pure steam. It's easier than mixing steam/chemical propellants. Most chemical propellants don't like getting wet, so why bother with them? I'm going to design this just as a revolver and forget about the prosthetic hand. I'll also forget about your "trick shot" seventh shot through the center of the revolving chamber. It adds a lot of mechanical complexity. Quick disclaimer: I take no responsibility for people building something like this device. It is intended to show how the mechanism of a steam revolver could work, nothing more. 

If the creature had refractive hairs on its outer shell, it could refract light into prismatic colours. Depending on the environment, this could either dazzle predators or blend its outline. This is evident in creatures such as the bobbit worm, which has an exoskeleton covered in fine hairs. At a push, these could be used intelligently to blend in with an environment. 

While most plants have 'nervous systems' which trigger in one direction only (Venus fly traps close, sundew plants curl up etc) - it's not impossible to imagine a mechanism where the Bernoulli principle causes a fluctuation of parts, which in turn, through another development of kelp-like gas sacs - allows a mechanical suction and storage of air. 

The shell could also have the same chemical qualities as a mood ring. The creature flushes blood around that section of the shell to change its colour. Finally, given that your creature has a whole day to prepare, it might use versions of camouflage other than colour changing. The assassin beetle, for instance, is covered in small barbs. It kills its prey, then wears the bodies on its shell. 

Remember, your valley could be wider and narrower in places, riddled with caves and be a tangled, winding shape as is natural for gullys cut by rivers. If this were the case, it could easily fit within the silhouette of the UK. In actuality, this would not be such a stretch of the imagination and could, potentially, exist were Antarctica a little closer to the edge of its tectonic plate. 

Failure Rates: The more moving parts you have, the more likely things are to break. Why is this? Well, if you have a part that works 99.99% of the time, and have a thousand of them, then your final product works only 90% of the time. Adding a pulley and moving the cable increase the probability of catastrophic failure thousands of times (can the cable even bend? Will it fatigue?). For every bolt you add, you both increase the strength requirements for the cable and you add another potential failure point..... That's just the way it is. In the case of a failure for a space elevator, your station slings off into space and you have to catch it a week or so later when it returns (yay - orbits), not to mention the expense of replacing the line. As a result, nearly everyone assumes we will see a single cable supporting the structure (very simple), and anything else will clamp on/around it (failure is non catastrophic for the station). This likely has a near-zero failure rate if your material is strong/durable enough. Strength As hinted at before, every gram of weight turns into tensile strength at geostationary orbit. Thus, we want everything to be as light as possible. Any station you add will require a bigger counterweight and stronger (or a higher count of) cables. If you have some cable material that is far far stronger than required (which is far far far far stronger than currently possible), then engineers may start considering something as you describe. A weight anywhere other than geostationary increases the load on the cable, and we can't currently produce a material that will work for a space elevator, let along one strong enough to hang other equipment off. Money What is the most expensive part of a space elevator? Probably either: 

"...It was on such a day that we came into contact with the war-like people of Phlogiston. On arriving in our dimension-hopping machine, we stepped out and immediately began taking notes. "The planet seemed to act like an outsized hive - with various specialised members of the race taking part in this or that aspect of society. Accounting, transport and socialites were the first to greet us - shortly followed by those dedicated to cleaning the streets and waste disposal. "It seems they had never seen outsiders before - indeed they seemed started to find that they were not alone in the universe. It was at this point that they bought forth what I can only analogise as their racial equivalent of 'soldier ants'. "These great, hulking creatures had been gym-trained and fed on sport. War had become as a game to them - much like the javelin and boxing is a sport to us, theirs were laser weapons and neck-break. They'd engage in 'friendly' rutting rituals which encouraged the survival of the strongest of the species and the withering decline of their weaker cousins. "A later analysis of their culture showed particular dedication to the heroes of their classical era - their fighters of monsters and slayers of dragons. "This last point - on which we shall end on - was our root cause for concern. A pair of bearded Victorian gentlemen in full dimension hopping gear, such as we were, must've been a frightful sight for such hairless brutes - and they reacted much as one might expect an Argonaut might. "It was a good week before I could calm Charles from his shaking and convince him to return to gather notes." TL;DR: nobody in the army actually kills anyone in basic training to be trained with a gun, and many of our games and sports reflect the survival instincts we as humans were born with. War may even be a hobby interest for your species - and they've just been waiting for the right targets to practice it on.

What tech would be needed? Extremely good power sources. The muzzle energy of a 0.45 pistol is around 560 joules per shot. An AA battery contains 12,000 joules. Or enough energy for about 20 shots under ideal situations. However, with every mass-based weapon, at least 50% of the energy goes into recoil, and as soon as you introduce the circuitry of a typical coil-gun, you're even lower. This guy measured 2-3% effective efficiency from stored->projectile, so not even the charging. Now if 12,000 joules is all used in one shot at 2% efficiency, we've gone down from a .45 round to a .22 round. Eh, maybe use a lithium cell instead of an alkaline! Even this is slightly ideal because an AA battery has less capacity at higher currents, so if you want a good refire rate, you'll need more batteries for the same output energy. But at this scale, it's at least feasible. A particle-beam pistol could be a viable weapon. (Note: it is hard to actually do this energy conversion. Coil guns typically aren't run on a single AA battery even if they only output energy in the 1-2Kj region) Hold on, I asked about particle accelerators and you're talking about coil guns and pistols Coil guns could be seen as a simpler and slightly more ideal form of particle accelerator. You put all your energy into accelerating the projectile. In a particle accelerator, you first have to ionise it. The projectiles travel faster, but the energy dealt on impact determines the damage done. 

So to round up, even though your two cultures speak the same language, their naming conventions could be completely (or partially) different. It would make sense to try to apply the naming convention of Culture B to the people of Culture A if they are interacting in Culture B and are from the weaker culture. Here's some examples for you: Norse -> Arabic: Karl Magnusson -> Karl ibn Magnus Arabic -> Nore: Hafiz ibn Rashid -> Hafiz Rashidson (sounds a bit weird, but that's what bastardising is all about) Arabic -> Anglo: Hafiz ibn Rashid -> Hafiz Rashid (most likely just drop the ibn) Hebrew -> Arabic: Simon ben Gabriel -> Simon ibn Gabriel (note both cultures are semitic, so the similarity is not surprising) EDIT: since you mention the word believable, I'll add this. Believable isn't always about people thinking it's realistic. Get your characters to alight on the weird bastardisation of names from one culture to the other even though they speak the same language. This provides audience with the needed level of believability because their subconscious concerns are shown to have been considered by the author as well. And on the reason why lineage is the most common now, it's possibly to do with number of social interactions. More people you meet, the higher the probability of meeting someone else with the same name. Therefore the lineage concept comes to mind as a quantifier. This is Bob & that is Bob, but this is Bob son of Greg and that is Bob son of Dave. 

In New Zealand there are plenty of rivers, but relatively few that people can boat on. Why? Most of them look like this for most of their length: 

My space colonists have just travelled to a new planet, and they will be landing using shuttles. The shuttles are water-based (like a seaplane) and the colony is/will be set up on a river near the sea. While travelling overseas, I realised that this would likely be quite similar to an airport. Unfortunately, wikipedia's page on "seaplane base" is exactly one sentence. The space-port does not need to be long-term-re-usable, as no spacecraft other than the colonists will be arriving. Similarly, it only has to handle incoming goods. Currently my plan is for first shuttles to land containing mostly equipment and construction workers. They will build accommodation and whatever is needed to handle all the colonists. Technology level is a few decades in advance of present time. The spacecraft is STL, and the journey was 'meerly' decades of shipboard time. The shuttles have the capacity of a 737-800 (20 tonne cargo or 200 passengers). There are ten shuttles and ten thousand colonists. What do they build and what equipment do they need to do their construction? The things I think they will be building include (in construction order): 

Entry eighteen, day 52 "Being low on supplies, Faraday called the suggestion that we make anchor on a nearby island to collect water and food. It was on gathering from a selection of fruiting trees that we detected a foul odour on the breeze - something akin to sulphur or decay. On checking our baskets, we found none of the fruit to be bad, nor could a place be found for the smell's origin. "As the weather closed in and took a turn for the worse, we gathered underneath a branching tree. Overhead, a large, dense cloud drew in, carried on the breeze. "It soon became apparent, however, that it was not a cloud, but a continent-sized growth of lichen - wiry as beard-hair and as light as spider webbing - which descended upon us like a snow. Light wisps at first, followed by large clippings. It soon threatened to engulf us, and we had to make a concerted effort to prevent it from compromising our shelter. On attempting to shift it with our bare hands, we found our skin to become rashed and chemical-bitten. "As the wind picked up again, the lichen was blown away in large patches - the hairy barbs caused it to clump together and take with it patches of fruit and bark from the nearby trees. It would appear that this is how the colony of lichen fed and received moisture, moving across the land like a travelling blight or cloud of locusts. "Large patches were left like carpet in the aftermath of a barber's shop, where the dry lichen had become too damp or laden to be carried by the wind. On the return journey to the ship, we were careful to avoid contact. Indeed, we saw some creatures which had not been as lucky as we had been to find shelter, and they had died of their afflictions." TL;DR: a lichen which, when dry, can be borne on the wind in large quantities resembling a mobile island without need for a root system
