It's something that you can try, but I'm not sure it'll succeed in a business setting. As you said, people are typically used to working to the half hour increments and offsetting that by 15 minutes can lead to some confusion and conflict with other people's schedules. You're always going to lose some time to small-talk/set-up etc/lateness. Offsetting the times by 15 minutes isn't going to do anything to prevent this. You could just assume that you're going to lose 15-20 minutes at the start of the meeting and extend the duration by that time, and people would accept this more readily. You can offset the longer duration by stating "Hopefully the meeting won't last this long". If the meeting then gets wrapped up early you can say 

Request a replacement monitor from your IT department. If they point out that they already allocated one to you, point it that it was removed from your desk by persons unknown. Let your supervisor sort things out. 

If you're not explicitly being asked for time estimates, provide them anyway as part of your response. That way, you're reporting back how long things will take upfront and there's a record of it (and he's led to implicitly accept those estimates). Of course, for the larger tickets, you won't have a good estimate, but you can communicate that you have to analyze before providing an estimate. 

If you're working in a community service industry (especially one concerned with domestic violence), then you're surely going to have resources to help employees out with these situations. Either talk to your manager about this, or seek out the appropriate resources using your employment handbook or web portal/intranet service. Failing this, talk to your doctor and ask for guidance. 

You boiled milk in a kettle? Yes, this will break it, or at least spoil the taste of the water for anyone else who uses the kettle going forwards. If you've ever boiled milk in a saucepan, you'll know that it boils over pretty easily if you don't watch it. This happening in a kettle will spew boiling milk out of the spout - which won't be a nice experience for anyone close by. You'll need to report this to the operations department, or whoever controls the kitchen equipment. Please only put water into kettles. Use microwaves or a hob to heat milk. 

You'll need to be prepared to open up to your manager regarding your thoughts about moving on, or what it is about your current company that isn't meeting your needs. There's a chance that your application hit the bottom of the bin and your manager/team won't know this has happened. But you may as well assume that your manager will find out, so prepare yourself for that to happen. In the meantime, stay quiet and do your job. 

Don't feel as though you need to search for negatives to provide a balanced view. It's really good to report that you're happy in your new job. 

Stop answering too many questions. Start teaching her how she can find the answers by herself. You can do this by working through the problems with her, or suggesting people she could ask, or where to look for the answers. If these questions/answers are in email, just forward your prior answers with a short amendment, according to the case in question. 

There's a more serious wider issue here This isn't just about the correctness of indentation and committing changes that impact everyone else. The larger problem is that you've taken it upon yourself to impose a change without talking with your manager or the rest of the team. While it's tempting to scatter-bomb changes into code/procedure because you feel it's a good idea, there's most probably an equally good reason why those changes aren't already in place. You'll get a heck of a lot more respect for raising these as discussion points in weekly/daily meetings/stand-ups and proposing ideas there than taking it upon yourself to make changes. 

Just be yourselves, there's no need to dress up the office in any way (but by all means tidy things up if they're messy). You're selling yourselves - it's most important to be able to show your expertise and communication skills. Be friendly, be knowledgeable. 

Firstly, ask yourself whether you really need/want this job. Can you see yourself working to the same standards/performance as the rest of the team currently does? Let your manager lead the discussion the way that he wants to - don't immediately start talking about how badly you've been doing as he might have his own expectations about your initial performance. Think about the reasons about why you feel you're under-performing and think about proposals to help that performance increase going forwards. It's OK to ask for help - you don't have to swim by yourself. 

There's no set dos and don'ts - it's just a confirmation that you're a good fit for the role or not. Usually, it's positive in nature - if you're not a good fit for the role this soon, it's an indication that the interview process has failed in some way. 

It shouldn't be a problem. Your boss/project manager should tell you what codes to use when booking your time for different projects. The likelihood is that this project was forecast to use x amount of resource for y amount of time equalling z amount of money. Spending too much money on projects affects the profit margin, so obviously keeping costs down per project is pretty important. However, most people are salaried (or on contract), so this doesn't map to people being paid less. So, if you're seen not to be related to the project, then the net cost of your project goes down by one amount of x. 

You just need to be a little tactful in your interview. Or just be confident with it in the "have you any questions for us?" segment. 

As an internee, you can reasonably expect to be monitored during your internship. If you can demonstrate that you're hitting or exceeding the targets for your work, I don't think that some coffee-break browsing could be punished. As always, the content of your browsing should be appropriate (so more news/research, less cat videos). 

As has been indicated in comments, there's simply not enough time between acceptance and the job starting for you to receive a formal job offer in the mail and return it before you start. Simply follow the instructions regarding starting work and go through the paperwork on arrival. If you don't like what you hear when you're there, then head right out of the door again (in a polite fashion, of course). 

Give a few examples of why there's not enough data for you to perform the lookups needed and suggest the root cause(s), and state what the minimum requirements that you need in order to meet your objectives. It's possible that there's been a communication failure and that you're only meant to deal with this sub-set of data in a specific fashion. This seems unlikely, but it might be the case. You'll soon get clarification when you report. It's not likely that you'll get in trouble for reporting back to your manager with whatever's blocking your work as long as you clearly describe the issues and do what you can to identify the cause of the blockage. 

It's doubtful. Companies like this would rather foster young talent for entry level jobs rather than experienced developers simply wanting an easy route into the company by picking a lower grade job. Regardless of how you justify this attempt, this is how it will be viewed by the hiring managers. Take the hard way in - go for the jobs that demand the experience you actually have. 

Yes. It's polite to thank people for the work they've done in sending you things. If you put a lot of work into an email, how would you feel if you heard nothing back? You're not blowing up people's inboxes by thanking them - you're being courteous. You're also implicitly telling the sender that you're happy with the contents of the email (and attachments) and have no further questions at this time. 

Ask for help Work isn't always fun and most of the time you just have to buckle down and get things done. Getting the uninteresting things out the way means that you move onto something else that might be more interesting. The better you do, the more things open up. For now, get some help to get over this immediate hurdle. If you can't cope, raise this as a problem and discuss ways in which you can get things sorted with your mentor/supervisor. It's important that you identify what you're having problems with - you won't get marked down for knowing where your current limits are if you're willing to learn. Or you can quit. 

Either live with it or quit and find another placement. You mentioned in comments that other interns are treated the same way, so without changing the situation for everyone, you can't change things for one person. So - quit or stick.
