What would the moral line be that parents could not cross when altering their children? A fair and just society that allows such selective breeding would necessarily have to create fairly levelled arenas of competition for access to education, athletic competition, and the average workplace (as is explored in the movie). We can already see some of this with advanced programs at elementary and high schools in which 'gifted' children are placed. Currently there is no other way to get there than to either work really hard to improve your bets, or to have a genetic advantage - this will change in the future. It will create a collection of parents who may not be gifted, and consequently likely to be poorer, who yet desire for their children to compete with the naturally and artificially gifted. Something similar exists in the world of professional athletic competition, with their various levels of competition. Contrast the rules of professional athletic competition with professional aesthetic bodybuilding. We see that pro bodybuilding allows enhancements otherwise banned in most pro athletics. If all have equal (and fair, since this can be very expensive) access to enhancements from the start, then why does pro sports ban enhancements? Likely because not because of the fact that enhancements are expensive, though that would be one reason to level the playing field by banning them (other than ensuring safe use, etc). Enhancements are the name of the game in pro bodybuilding, and anyone and everyone who goes into it, unless if it is for 'natural' bodybuilding, is aware of that. Perhaps being 'gifted', 'natural' or otherwise, will become a prerequisite for many types of jobs of the future, as was explored in Gattaca. What kind of extreme genetic changes could be made by those wishing to bypass this moral line? What is moral and what is ethical? I think what matters is that whatever is done is done so ethically. People make porn, and that's fine in many societies but it is immoral in others - but that's just morality, not necessarily ethics. You still need to ensure safety, prevent abuse, etc. There are rules in place for that. New rules will need to be devised for situations where this new breed of humans interact with others, in order to ensure justice. This one is up to the imagination, really. What if you simulated millions of permutations of an evolved human with two sets of arms and more than 5 fingers on each hand, along with the necessary changes in the brain to coordinate these two sets meaningfully? What if this same permutation had an ability to perform higher level thinking on multiple subjects simultaneously? This person would be able to be their own drummer, guitarist, and singer. Or they could be suffering from severe mental or physical pain that simulations somehow got wrong, or whatever could have went wrong, did go wrong. Obviously (hopefully) you'd do a ton of simulations before proceeding with such a radical experiment. I hope those that are indeed willing to cross the 'moral lines' will at least do so in an ethical way. What kinds of laws would a society of this nature have to have in order to keep these reproductive genetic testing/enhancements in check? It would try to continue to shorten the gap between the ultra rich and the poor. It would create playing fields for access to education and work for people of all disabilities, abilities, and extra abilities in ways fair and just for all. 

Have you considered folding spikes? Rather than trying to retract them into the body, perhaps instead the spikes fold back against the tail when they're not needed. Properly designed, the spikes can be made much safer folded back than fanned out. Imagine a razor - if you press your finger against the blade it will cut you, but if you stack five together so their blades are flat with each other they barely cut at all. Perhaps your creatures' tails fold back like that. Such powerful spikes also need maintenance- you can't just drop them and regrow like a porcupine. Culturally your creatures might let their tails blunt and only sharpen them for war (an adaptation to denser society). They may also wear clothing over the top to protect their spikes and others. More generally, consider why your creatures evolved such fantastic weapons - there may be arrangements of spikes (eg. forming a blade facing out) that provide utility for its ancient use cases without exposing yourself to too much self-harm. 

A one time pad at least as long as your message (or, if we're willing to settle for a shorter cipher, as many ciphers as you have messages) Received every message you've sent me up until your current one (and both of us destroying pads once they've been used) Successfully hidden my one time pad from the enemy 

None of these tactics guarantees a kill against a powerful Blood Shaman, but they all present at least a small chance to gain the upper hand against a Shaman. And the Shaman has to win every engagement. We just have to win once. 

Even if you think this is achievable, you have to do it twice: India's Mars Orbiter Mission has a resolution high enough to see a the crater that would be left, and the instruments to verify Mars Express' "detection." MOM communicates via India's own IDSN network, which is physically located in India. Also: you wouldn't want to. 

Jet engines require compressors. Otherwise, there is no way to maintain the flow of intake air into the combustion chamber. Unless your dragon is a hypersonic ramjet-powered dragon, that means rotating parts. I know of no animal (real or fictional) with precision-balanced thousand-rpm spinning organs. A dragon that breathes fire doesn't need to worry about burning, as long as it can manage the short bursts of heat. However, continuous combustion means that you have to deal with high temperatures all the time. Either the dragon's combustion chamber must be ablative (burns away slowly) in which case it probably ablates away much faster than it grows back, or must be made of a heat resistant material like typical jet engines. Again, I know of no animals with titanium organs. A typical small jet has a fuel consumption of around 6 gallons per minute, equivalent to around 20,000 L of methane gas per minute. At this point your dragon will probably look more like a blimp than a jet. 

However, I don't like the part in the 'rules' that states "main character." The idea that this mechanism is specific to one particular individual is unattractive to me. Extending the Model Braid introduces a new feature into the mix: some people in the universe are not affected by your power. In terms of the model above, their mental state is also coped into the past.2 I don't want to use this exact behavior for two reasons: 

Oh dear oh dear oh dear. Where do I start? I highly recommend Command and Control by Eric Schlosser. It's an account of American nuclear safety and policy through the Cold War. It's an excellent, if somewhat alarming read. There was a lot that could and nearly did cause a nuclear disaster, especially when they were being flown around by bombers, at least until saner, safety minded people finally prevailed and forced better safety standards. What precisely could have gone wrong? 

You may not realise, but animals no more run by instinct than do humans. Like humans, they too have needs. These needs are served by the Animal Court, lowest of the heavenly courts. Formed from the descendants of twelve virtuous animals (the animals of the Chinese zodiac) the Animal Court convenes twice a year and attends to the administration of the animal world, hearing pleas and grievances and communicating them to the higher courts. Being an official of the Animal Court has its privileges: members of the court are permitted to remove their hides and live as humans while the court is not convened, conducting ourselves as they see fit so long as we do not become derelict in our duties. However, we animal courtiers are feared by humans; Werewolves, wicked humans so cruel they were demoted into bestial forms for their crimes, also wear the skins of animals to savage their fellow humans. Alas, not all werewolves take the form of wolves. Unfortunately, most humans aren't able to distinguish between us and so both of us are hunted alike. In times past, the solution was to convene the court far from prying eyes, away from the cities. But now that humanity has industrialised and humans flock to cities like never before, it has become impossible to simply avoid humans as we once did. But even the cities have animals and the Animal Court is still responsible for them. So the question is: how can we still hold court without getting caught? A few notes: 

The first problem we have to solve is power: where does the light energy come from? Our options are the same as for every other spacecraft: 

Assuming a more "reasonable" value for the sag of $125~\text{m}$ (obtained by limiting the grade at the ends to 10%) gives us a shape like this: 

Branching Timelines Model This is the model that I use internally (i.e. in my head) when I'm thinking about rewinding time-travel. Essentially, time flows horizontally from left-to-right. Whenever someone rewinds, the timeline ends, and a new timeline splits off from the point they rewound from. The new timeline is one layer down horizontally, so that overall progress is left-to-right, top-to-bottom like English text. Reversing Timeline View The person who suggested this view to me called it the "garden-path" model. The layout is the same as before (and the horizontal positions are the same), but the branch connections have been removed, and lines have been drawn from each rewind to the timeline that rewind starts. This forces you to follow the diagram in the same order as the text. There are a couple of additional annotations on this view: 

The sky straight overhead. Even accounting for seeing (atmospheric turbulence) we have an almost totally unimpaired view of the stars at night through the couple of km of air overhead. Satellites also have no trouble looking back down at the Earth. From this perspective the atmosphere is optically thin. The horizon. Looking at the ocean you can barely see a slight curvature. More importantly, objects passing over the horizon (ships and distant land) appear distorted from atmospheric refection and washed-out from scattering. However, although the Sun is dimmed enough to become viewable by the naked eye at sunset, it is still clearly visible. The atmosphere is not optically thick when viewed edge-on. 

Good news, it's not too hard for our friend Tunguska. The magic word is realpolitik Let's get started with her strategic profile. She's not an army - strategically, she's a walking, talking metaphor for the nuclear bomb. If her pet country were reduced to waste in a war, she could still obliterate at least one or two major cities of the offending (super)power before being brought down herself. That nearly automatically* makes her a small nuclear power in her own right, so long as she can protect herself from a first strike. From a realpolitik perspective, that she's in fact a literal fire-breathing dragon means less than her geopolitical value. If she's politically valuable, even the staunchest dracophobe will sing her praises to high heaven and overlook even the deepest flaws. If she's a political foe, she could have spent her time in hiding as Mother Teresa herself and she'd still be a baby-eating monster for whom a swift death is the only appropriate course of action. This provides her with a pathway to sovereign status: by making a deal with, say, Russia (since she was born there) to recognise her sovereignty in exchange for her alliance she can quickly secure her place in the world, while the superpower in question transforms a rogue nuclear weapon into a known (and allied!) quantity. She'd still make enemies, but with superpower backing and personal power a direct move against her would be foolhardy in the extreme. The tricky bit is the fact that Tunguska is also gearing up to get into a war. That may turn her into a liability if she's not careful. Since she's at the same strategic scale as a nuclear weapon, countries will understandably get very very nervous if she starts fighting anyone; it will be very important to make sure the right people know what she's up to, lest she spark a nuclear conflict - or a pre-emptive strike to prevent one. The plus side is that assuming her rival has the same idea (only convincing someone to ally to make dragons quietly go away), there's a good chance the whole dragon war can be kept localised - like other proxy wars geopolitics will keep the big players' hands tied for fear of sparking a more final war, and both Tunguska and her rival will probably be told in no uncertain terms to keep it that way. If her rival doesn't, well, that only means Tunguska has a chance to convince the world that this is something they want to get involved in as a global matter and propaganda herself into a champion of humanity. She'd at least get her own ally onboard - it can't hurt for their dragon to to win that fight. *There's a reasonable case to be made that some countries might declare her a sovereign power unilaterally, simply because diplomats and the army are the most appropriate tools to interact with her. 

Analysis First off, don't panic! The diagrams below look complicated (and, well, they are...) but are not hard to understand. I suggest you glance over them, read the descriptions below, then go back and look over them again. Just a couple of quick pointers ahead of time: 

Lots of the answers so far have focused on the economic reasons why a floating city is impossible. But what about physical reasons? Aerodynamic Levitation As a first approximation, we can treat the city as an air bearing. There are a couple formulas that we can take from an intro fluid flow class to calculate the amount of airflow required to hold us up, assuming incompressible laminar flow. $$ \dot M \approx \frac{\pi b^3 \rho\sigma g}{3\mu} $$ Where $b$ is the distance in between our city and the ground, $\rho$ is air density and $\mu$ is viscosity, $\sigma$ is the load of our city and $g$ is gravity. Here are the values I assume: 

Note that since aluminum has one more neutron than an even split (like nitrogen and oxygen), in this case we have to dump excess protons instead of excess neutrons. A possible explanation for the magical transmutation could be a sort of probability manipulation, forcing the quantum-mechanical waveform to collapse into the desired state. How you justify your magic is ultimately up to you though. Update While playing around with my code, I stumbled across a much more efficient transmutation: turning mercury into platinum: 

In principle there's nothing stopping a plant from developing a natural radio. Let's start with what a radio really is, in the most reductive form. A radio is nothing more than an antenna made of conductive material to particular dimensions, to make it resonant with electromagnetic waves of a particular frequency. By applying a changing electrical charge to it, we can cause it to emit signals of that frequency, and we can use it to receive signals of that frequency. Optionally, we might add a waveguide to concentrate or direct the signal. The conductor is easy - any nervous system is already a network of conductors transmitting electrical signals. Forming a section of nerve-like tissue in the shape of a patch antenna (so named for simply being a rectangle of copper on a surface or similar), placed near the surface, would make a perfectly serviceable, if rudimentary antenna. With this alone the rocket could communicate by radio over short distances by thinking into the antenna. Power is an issue but not insurmountable, given your plant is intelligent and able to grow rockets. Adding a waveguide isn't much harder. A properly shaped section of wood could easily act as a parabolic dish, and specially shaped cavities to act as resonators and waveguides is not without precedent- whales and dolphins already evolved this for their sonar. On the ground, a natural crater or dormant caldera would make for a marvellous dish - a particularly tall tree with a handful of antennae at the focal point of the dish would make for an excellent receiver. Combining the two, you could in theory have a plant that manages to incorporate a radio. It doesn't have to be a patch and a parabolic dish, either: if your plant can engineer a rocket, it can engineer an antenna and waveguide of any kind. In practice a lot will depend on the specific properties of the materials available to your plant. Mere wood as we know it is unlikely to be suitable for a waveguide, and the nervous system is unlikely to be up to the task of transmission. In the case of Avatar, the superconducting unobtanium rather dramatically solves the latter issue, though something more boring like a copper nervous system would probably be more than sufficient. Either way some exotic plant materials may be necessary to make this all work.
