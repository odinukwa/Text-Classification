Let $0<\sigma\leq 1$. Let $T$ be large. How can we give good explicit $L^2$ bounds on the tails of $\zeta(\sigma+it)$? That is, we want to bound the quantity $$\int_{\sigma-i\infty}^{\sigma-iT} + \int_{\sigma+iT}^{\sigma+i\infty} \frac{|\zeta(s)|^2}{|s|^2} ds.$$ Morally, we should expect something about as good as $1/T$ for $\Re(s)\geq 1/2$, and presumably $1/T^{2\sigma}$ for $0<\Re(s)\leq 1/2$ (or maybe I ate a $\log$). In particular, we should certainly expect to do better than what we can get from convexity bounds on individual values of $\zeta(s)$. (Such bounds are, incidentally, explicit (Backlund)). 

Was Vinogradov's first proof of the three-prime theorem effective? Reasons for my question: Vinogradov presented his proof in 1937 in a monograph; the English translation by K.F. Roth and A. Davenport is based on the second version of the monograph, from 1947. There is no doubt that the proof in the second version is effective - Vinogradov goes to great pains to prove a "nearly-log-free" result (as opposed to a bound worse by a factor of $(\log x)^c$, which he proves with much greater ease) because he allows himself to use Siegel-Walfisz only in Page's effective version (= primes are well distributed in arithmetic progressions up to modulus $m\leq (\log n)^{2-\epsilon}$, and exceptions after that in a moderate range would all have to occur for moduli that are multiples of a single modulus of size $> (\log n)^{2-\epsilon}$). However, I'm finding the 1937 original (in Russian) hard to get. Did he use the usual, ineffective version of Siegel-Walfisz there? Did he already have "nearly-log-free" estimates at the time? Two more historical questions. (a) It must have been realized at some point that one does not really need nearly-log-free results to get an effective result (= every odd integer larger than a constant $C$ is the sum of three primes, where $C$ is an enormous constant that can in principle be specified). This is so because there isn't really an exceptional modulus $q$, but, rather, there could be an exceptional character modulo $q$; the other characters modulo $q$ are fine. Thus, Vinogradov's simpler, non-log-free bound is enough for effectivity, even though it's far from optimal. When was this first remarked in the literature? (I can't find any awareness of this in Vinogradov's monograph (translation of 1947 version); he uses Siegel-Walfisz-Page as a black box.) (b) The first explicit value for $C$ was computed by Borozdkin, who was apparently an assistant and former student of Vinogradov's. The only reference I've got for this is what looks like a mention in the proceedings of a Soviet conference. Did the full version appear anywhere? Note: I can read Russian, but, like most people working outside Russian-speaking areas, I find many Russian-language historical materials to be hard to get. Links to electronic versions of the documents discussed above would be very welcome. 

This is a standard argument in Pesin Theory, which I'll sketch below leaving details to the reader. Let's pretend $M = \mathbb T^d, d \geq 2$, so that I don't have to bother with charts (the proof is local anyway and so can be transcribed verbatim onto a single chart). Let $x, x_n \in \Lambda_{\chi, l}, n \geq 0$ and assume (i) $x_n \to x$ and (ii) $\dim E^u(x_n) \equiv \dim E^u(x)$. Without loss we can pass to a subsequence $x_{n}$ along which $\{E^u(x_{n})\}$ converges to a subspace $E \subset T_x M$. It suffices to show that $E = E^u(x)$. If not, then there is a unit vector $e \in E$ for which $e = e^u + e^s$ with $e^s \neq 0$ (here we split according to $E^u \oplus E^s$ at $x$). Now, $e$ is the limit of some sequence of unit vectors $e_n \in E^u(x_n)$. Below, $k$ is fixed and $n \geq 1$: $$ \| df^{-k}_x e\| \leq \| df^{-k}_x - df^{-k}_{x_n} \| + \| df^{-k}_{x_n}(e - e_n)\| + \| df^{-k}_{x_n} e_n\| $$ Taking $n$ to infinity, the first and second terms vanish, while the third term is $\leq l e^{- k \chi}$ for all $n$. On the other hand, $$ \| df^{-k}_x e \| \geq \| df^{-k}_x e^s\| - \| df^{-k}_x e^u\| \geq l^{-1} e^{\chi k} \| e^s\| - l e^{- \chi k} \| e^u\| , $$ which is clearly incompatible with the earlier estimate when $k$ is sufficiently large. We conclude $\|e^s\| = 0$, i.e., $E = E^u(x)$. 

(The question I asked at first.) In case (b), can one give a better bound on $\ell'$ than $O((\log n)^2)$? (Answer: no; see below.) (The question I meant to ask.) In case (b), can one give a better on bound on $\ell$ than $O((\log n)^2)$? Perhaps $O(\log n)$? (Answer: yes; see below.) 

Actually, isn't question 2 brutally trivial? The following argument seems to show that the space $W$ spanned by the eigenspaces with eigenvalue $\geq \delta$ has dimension $\geq k$. Suppose this weren't the case. Then there would be a non-trivial linear combination $\sum_i a_i v_i$ orthogonal to $W$. Thus, on the one hand, $$\left\langle S\left(\sum_i a_i v_i\right), \sum_i a_i v_i\right\rangle < \delta \left|\sum_i a_i v_i\right|^2 = \delta \sum_i |a_i|^2,$$ but, on the other hand, $$\begin{aligned}\left\langle S\left(\sum_i a_i v_i\right), \sum_i a_i v_i\right\rangle &= \sum_{i,j} \overline{a_i} a_{j} \langle S v_i, v_{j}\rangle\\ &= \sum_i |a_i|^2 \langle S v_i, v_i\rangle \geq \delta \sum |a_i|^2.\end{aligned}$$ Contradiction. 

but this is very slow since it has to search through all the subfields. Does anyone know a faster way to get this cubic subextension? 

If $l \equiv 1$ mod 3 then $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_l)$ has a unique cubic subextension. I've been getting this field with the following magma code 

and it gives you [-1, w^2 - 1, w + 1] which generate the unit group, but I can't figure out how to get this same data in magma. Alternatively if anyone knows how to tell if something is totally positive in sage, that would work too. 

Does anyone know of any papers which give results on the existence of Minkowski units in totally real cyclic fields of prime degree? F. Marko has some results for composite degree in his paper "On the existence of Minkowski units in totally real cyclic fields" but I'm more interested in the prime degree case. See $URL$ 

Let $$\Lambda_z(n) = \sum_{d|n, d>z} \mu(d) \log(d/z).$$ As S. Graham proved in 1978, $$\sum_{n\leq x} |\Lambda_z(n)|^2 \sim x \log(x/z).$$ provided $x\geq z$. We also know that, by the large sieve or Brun-Titchmarsh, $$\sum_{a mod q} \left|\mathop{\sum_{n\leq x}}_{n\equiv a \mod q} \Lambda(n)\right|^2$$ is at most about $2 x^2/q$. Question: can one bound $$\sum_{a mod q} \left|\mathop{\sum_{n\leq x}}_{n\equiv a \mod q} \Lambda_z(n)\right|^2$$ by at most about a constant times $x^2/q$? (Of course one can bound it by $x^2 \log(x/z)/q$, by Graham's 1978 bound plus Cauchy-Schwarz. The better bound $x^2/q$ is easy for $q$ and $z$ small. I am interested in seeing a proof that works for $x/q\leq z\leq x$.) 

This is not a precise argument, but rather a conceptual reason why you shouldn't expect stable manifolds to sit inside global attractors (even for ODE on $\mathbb R^n$). By definition, all trajectories are attracted to the global attractor in forwards time. What distinguishes points in the attractor from points outside has to do with behavior in backwards time: the attractor is precisely what remains in the limit when you take $t \to - \infty$. This is, morally speaking, the content of Theorem 10.7 in Robinson's book.(*) On the other hand, the stable manifold through a point $x$ in the attractor is determined solely by future behavior. So, points on $W^s_x$ get very close to the attractor in forwards time. But this does not "single out" points of $W^s$ for membership in the attractor. (*) The concept of isolating neighborhood of an attractor formalizes this idea (for continuous systems on compact spaces, and also to some extent for dissipative systems on non-locally-compact spaces-- a common reference is Rybakowski). 

Let $n$ be an odd prime and $l$ also a prime s.t. $l\equiv1 \bmod n$. I want a fast way to compute the $n^{th}$ degree subextension of the $l^{th}$ cyclotomic field. I need to compute lots of these in magma so the faster the better. Ennola-Turunen's paper "On Cyclic Cubic Fields" enables me to do this very quickly for the $n=3$ case, but for the general case I am simply doing the following 

which is slower than I'd like. It would be lovely if I could find something similar to help me compute these more quickly in the general case. Does anyone have any suggestions or references? 

Let $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a convex body, symmetric about the origin and with nonempty interior. Then John's theorem asserts that there exists a unique ellipsoid $E$ of minimal volume such that $K \subset E$. My question: let $K, K'$ be two such convex sets (that is, symmetric with nonempty interior), and apply John's theorem to get the John's ellipsoids $E, E'$ respectively. Suppose that $K \subset K'$. Is it true, then, that $E \subset E'$? I have been concerned with how John's ellipsoid varies as you vary the convex set $K$, in particular how the gauge function of $E$ varies. Suppose my claim is true: then it would follow that for any two convex bodies $K_1, K_2$ (again, symmetric about the origin and with nonempty interior) with John's ellipsoids $E_1, E_2$, we'd have $$ \sup_{v \in \mathbb{R}^d} \left| 1 - \frac{n_{E_1}(v)}{n_{E_2}(v)} \right| \leq \sup_{v \in \mathbb{R}^d} \left| 1 - \frac{n_{K_1}(v)}{n_{K_2}(v)} \right| $$ where $n_K$ is the gauge function of a convex body $K$.
