As a beginner is about the only time you can lose fat and build muscle at the same time. So, my suggestions for getting started: 

I've run 5/3/1 while losing weight. I've also run more demanding programs under the watchful eye of a coach while losing weight. During both of those times I did remarkably well, losing fat and getting stronger. I'll echo the dietary recommendations on eating for performance: 

I'd take a look at what you are eating in addition to how much you are eating. A diet consists of many facets, and you are trying to do something that is not natural for your body to do: lose weight. The challenge is to trick your body into burning its fat instead of just the food you consume. The problem is that many times people cut too much of the wrong things and are actually becoming counter productive. My personal weight loss journey started with an unbalanced diet. The key to the diet was controlling the pancreatic function. There's a number of diets that are similar in nature to what I did, but there's a few principles to glean even if you choose to keep a balanced diet. 

The hypertrophy affect happens because you demand more of your muscles today than you did yesterday. If you increase your total reps, or add resistance (i.e. more weight), or do the same work in less time, you are keeping the hypertrophy affect. Also understand that if you never demand more of your body, it will never grow beyond your initial demands. Just focus on increasing the demands a little at a time, and your muscles will grow. It doesn't matter if you are doing several sets with the same number of reps, or if the reps decrease each set. 

Without knowing your goals, your training plan, the time you spend in the gym, the workload you put in the gym, it's going to be difficult to prescribe anything that will 100% work. However, there are a few principles you can go by: 

If you do go down the path of martial arts and weight training, it might be good to focus on strength 2x a week, and conditioning/mobility/skill work at least 3x a week--and that's not including your classes. 

Other Training Modes Deadlifts are glorious things. Nothing builds back strength like picking something really heavy up off the ground. However, full squats and deadlifts have a good synergy. Full squats help get the bar off the ground--which for many people is the hardest part. There are different variations of leg and core training that help maintain the joint health benefits of full squats, while emphasizing different muscle groups. 

The 5x5 set of workouts (Strong Lifts, Bill Star, Pendley, Madcow, etc.) have you start with a weight that is well below what you can physically lift. The general principle with all of the variations is that you are consistently adding on more weight each day you do the exercise. Your supporting muscles also need to get strong, so this seems like a good plan while your body is getting used to working out. Another common theme among these workouts is that you are not working your body to exhaustion or failure. You are doing 5 sets of 5 reps each time until you can't increase any more that way. Then you start with some of the other variations (like 3x5 or 1x5). Sometimes you'll be sore, and sometimes not. In the beginning definitely not. That said, I've been doing the Strong Lifts 5x5 for two weeks (tomorrow) and I can definitely tell that my muscles have grown in that time. And I just started out with the bar weight. My most challenging lift is the overhead press, and after the first time doing that I felt sore. The next time, not so much. I personally have noticed this cycle (in the brief time I've done the Strong Lifts program): 

They come in difference sizes, so start small and work your way up. Pinch it open between your pinky and your thumb. This tip comes from Mr. Ed Coan himself. When your grip breaks, it's always the pinky side first. If you get that side stronger the grip will be harder to break. Next in the grip builders is to pinch grip a dumbbell by the fat part and increase time. When you get to 30s grip you can get a heavier dumbbell. This allows you to build up the grip with what you can handle right now. Assess your Set Up Something I recommend you do is to assess your setup on the pull-up bar. It could be that your hands are too close together or too far apart and your wrists are bending at an unnatural angle. When you add weight to that it stresses the ligaments and tendons rather than strengthening the surrounding muscle. It also might be that you need to focus on neutral grip pull-ups for the time being until your grip naturally gets stronger from the pull-ups. 

You can use both of these approaches depending on your schedule. I do not recommend trying to sandwich rock climbing on the rest day between weight training sessions. 

In this example, person A would need to lose 12 lbs and person B would need to lose 10 lbs. If you can maintain a pace of losing 1 lbs a week it can be accomplished in 3 months or less. The problem is that as you get to 15% the best bodybuilders will lose 1 lb of lean mass for every 3 lbs of fat. NOTE: that doesn't necessarily mean that you are losing muscle, just mass that isn't fat. Using this formula, we are looking at: 

Check out the "Intro" I wrote, which will help you decide how to get started. The first step is finding a program that works with your goals. Since you are brand new, following someone else's beginner program is going to be more beneficial than randomly picking up weights and doing stuff. The beginners programs will usually have the big three: squats, bench press, and deadlifts. Also very common is the overhead press. A little more devided would be the opinions on whether beginners should start with power cleans (a very good, but very technical lift) or simply do barbell rows. The basics of nutrition for a weightlifter is this: 1g protein per pound body weight, and the rest of the Calories as you see fit. Your muscles don't know or care whether the energy from the food comes from carbs or fat. Some things are clear, such as if you eat more Calories than you burn regularly you will gain weight. Some things are less clear, such as what impact carbs has on your body, and when you should have them. In some ways the more active you become, the less critical it becomes. 

The most important thing to keep in mind is the goal you are trying to achieve at the moment. Periodization is a method to have a logical progression of goals to help achieve some final end goal. For example, power lifting periodization has an ultimate goal of a new 1 rep max in competition. To achieve that ultimate goal you first go through an "accumulation" phase (similar to your loading phase), an optional "switching" phase, and then a "realization" phase. The progression of building more base strength through volume through less and less volume to more and more intensity is a proven way to increase your 1 rep max. There's a bit more to it, obviously, but each phase has a specific goal. The heavier the weight, the more stress it puts on your body. One of the ways to live in the '3' world (see the grading scale above) is to make sure you don't go above 90% unless you are preparing for competition. Most of your training can and should be done with lighter weights--particularly if you are trying to put on muscle size which requires a lot of volume. As intensity, or the weight on the bar, goes up; then volume has to go down to compensate. The lower the volume, or the shorter the number of reps, the more you are training your nervous system rather than your muscles. Every successful program has a philosophy behind it and a reason for manipulating the training variables. Some guys will write books about their training methodology such as Paul Carter, Jim Wendler, and Mark Rippetoe. You can learn a lot from they similarities and differences between the programs and why each of them made those choices. The guys I referenced are all power lifters, and I have books from each of them. I recommend finding equivalent guys in bodybuilding to help understand the tradeoffs in that style of training. 

Imagine for a moment chasing the ever decreasing amount of calories to support your weight loss progress as you slowly lose muscle mass. All too often with diets like that, you lose muscle mass and then start eating the same as you did before the diet. The problem is your BMR is different now. You will not only gain back the weight you lost, but you'll gain more. That's why you don't compromise protein when you are cutting carbs/sugars/fats. Fiber is also important for your own comfort, but not quite as important as protecting your muscles. 

Even though I primarily focus on training for power lifting, I still incorporate certain bodyweight exercises such as push ups, dips, pull ups, etc. For me a set ends when I can't get a another full rep in. If my reps go down, but my weight goes up it might still be a net improvement. In either case, this number is kept separate from the weight I use for tracking general weight loss. My full gear weight can be up to 10 lbs heavier than my morning weight tracking due to water retention and the weight of the gear. The purpose of weighing myself just prior to training is simply for tracking my training progress--and is particularly important when I do body weight work. Useful case for weighing yourself multiple times The process of making weight for a competition sometimes requires dehydrating yourself just long enough to make your weight class. These people have already dieted down using normal means, and the effort to get those last couple pounds off means they have to sweat out or spit out the excess water until they hit the target goal. During this time, the athlete will be weighing themselves multiple times to see how close to their goal they've become. After the athlete weighs in, they start the process of rehydrating and refeeding themselves so they can be in the best competitive shape (and more than their weigh-in weight by several pounds). An athlete can reduce as much as 2-3% of their body mass safely using this process, but I've seen cases where it went poorly. A bad rehydration process cost a friend of mine several pounds on the platform as he had diarrhea. Trying to reduce more than your body can handle will require hospitalization to get back to proper health. Below are a few resources that detail the correct way to do this: 

It sounds like you have no muscular endurance, and have reached the end of this cycle myophibrilar range training (1-6 reps per set). Bench likes volume. People with bigger arms tend to bench better than people with smaller arms. I understand if you aren't trying to look like a body builder, but you'll need to add useful mass to your frame. I'm not telling you to go out and eat like Micheal Phelps. Just eat more and do the work necessary to get big. Also check out the Raw Bench series by Paul Carter. If adding an arch isn't making a difference and you run out of energy before you can finish a pyramid, then you need to focus on sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and muscular endurance for a while. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy isn't just for size, it's for increasing your energy supply systems in the muscle. If you don't do anything for your energy systems you are going to run out of energy before you can lift heavier weight. You may try to work with Madcow or Wendler 5/3/1 using the Big But Boring assistance package for a bit, as both did good things for my bench. Madcow arranges the work like this: 

Don't Confuse Size with Genetics and Training My former coach won the genetic lottery as someone who can just naturally get beastly strong. An example of that genetic pool, he took his mother to the weight room and she squatted over 300 lbs on her first day with no prior training. I'm pretty sure she was sore after that. There are several power lifters who are quite overweight and who have incredible lifts. There are also many examples of power lifters who are quite a bit leaner and lift just as much weight (Dan Green is one example). The fat guys that destroy skinny guys can do that in part due to different leverages, different amounts of muscle on their frame, and a majorly different focus in their training. Don't discount the effect of training to lift heavier things vs. just trying to look good naked. There's a rumor that for every 4 pounds you gain one of it is muscle. I haven't seen anything authoritatively address this rumor, but that's also at a very high cost. Mass Affects Some Exercises More Than Others What people fail to realize is that mass changes your leverages. That increase in ability isn't always an increase of strength. Bench press is one of those lifts that is positively affected by an increase in mass. However, there does come a point of diminishing returns. I know a guy named Norman Rice, who is one of the outliers who took StrongLifts to a squat and deadlift in the 600s and bench over 400 lbs. He also ate to get through plateaus, did the resets, etc. He is also very likely someone who got the genetic jackpot like my former coach. 

If you decide to go for adjustable weights (like what Meade illustrated above), I do recommend getting more than one pair of handles. That will let you have all the weights you need for your training session already set up. In general, the more compound you can make your movements, the more you will stimulate your body to build mass. The more isolated you make your movements, the more you will shape the mass you have. For example, goblet squats will stimulate more of your body than curls. Same with dumbbell deadlifts and standing overhead press. You can do the movements unilaterally, meaning alternating sides, which will strengthen your core and stabilizing muscles at the same time you are working on other muscles. It's best to start really light, so you can focus on technique. Do plan on regularly increasing the weights on a schedule. It takes the mystery out of "do I go up or not?", and it prevents stagnating progress because your body is used to the weight. If you can't get all your desired reps at the heavier weight, or the reps are really ugly, repeat the weight for the next cycle. The goal is to get stronger and stronger. 

Short answer is this: when in doubt, ask management. A longer answer includes some general principles: 

There is a rhyme and a reason for the variety. The idea is that if you exercise one side of the body, you should balance it by exercising the other. For example, pushups work your arms, chest, and core. Things that balance it are reverse pushups and back raises. The balance to planks would be back raises. The balance to pullups would be dips. If you can't do it with strict form just yet, don't worry too much about it. Just try to get more and more strict with form as you can. That will help you get stronger and stronger.
