If you really do mean a common/important word in English without a reasonably-close, single-word translation in at least one other language, there must be many, many examples. My favorite example is that the word "fewest" is missing in Swedish. Swedish has close equivalents for few and fewer but switches to "minst antal" (roughly "least number") for fewest (though some may mistranslate to the Swedish word for "smallest"). Of course, you might discount "fewest" since only "few" is common enough to qualify as important. A database search should provide better hits. 

A case where a pronoun cannot be substituted by any definite description that may be recovered from the context is discussed by Walter Edelberg in his paper ‘A New Puzzle about Intentional Identity’ (Journal of Philosophical Logic 15 [1986]). Edelberg discusses the sentence in (1) from Peter Geach’s paper ‘Intentional Identity’ (Journal of Philosophy 74 [1967]): 

(1) demonstrates that certain verbs that take finite clauses as semantic complements can (or must) be separated from them by non-referential it; but this is not an option for noun phrase complements of the same verbs. (2) demonstrates that noun phrases can appear between a verb that selects them as argument and a predicate (rude above) that is also an argument of the verb; but this is not an option for finite clauses. However, phrases of different syntactic categories may sometime overlap with respect to the grammatical functions they realize in the sentence. Both noun phrases and finite clauses (with the complementizer that) may be the subject of a sentence, for example. You can read a little bit more about the difference between syntactic category and grammatical function in this post. 

Complex relationships (e.g., Chaldean) are probably just chance. I don't accept the "too complex to be coincidence" argument. Given a large set of symbols of numerical (or other) value, connections are bound to occur. Not finding anything like this would be amazing. Simple relationships, such as "Father + Mother = Child" could also be coincidence but they could easily have be designed or at least "encouraged". Considering the significance of numbers in religion, a connection like this could almost be required for such a fundamental statement. So, if it wasn't there already, synonyms could be encouraged or new words coined to make it true. It would be interesting to know how many of these were purely by chance and how many were designed or encouraged. It probably wouldn't be possible to know for sure without a record of the words/letters before association with numbers. [Then we could see if the "coincidences" increased or remained the same.] 

Adopting (2) means that according to (1), we derive the meaning of almost half crazy by first combining the meanings of half and crazy and then combining the meaning of almost with that of half crazy. Since half crazy has the same meaning as half sane, it’s not clear how almost gives one meaning when combined with the first and another meaning when combined with the second. One way to solve the problem is to deny that the expressions almost half crazy/sane have the structure in (1) and assign them instead the constituent structure in (3), which is also given by the tree in (4). 

In text mode, you can simply use the command to format some text as a subscript. So h3, for instance, can be made with . More problematic might be symbols like the palatal stops, *ḱ, *ǵ, and *ǵʰ, or accented long vowels, like *ā́, *ḗ, and *ṓ. There aren't, to the best of my knowledge, pre-composed glyphs of these, so you'll almost certainly want to be using XeTeX with the package (and a font containing the appropriate glyphs) to write these characters. 

Recently, the World Phonotactics Database was launched. While I've noticed some errors in languages I'm familiar with, it may be useful to check there. First off, is there a trend across languages in terms of syllable structure? To start with, let's look at how many consonants can be in an onset. Their sample contains 2,338 languages. Of these, 2 do not allow onsets, 1,363 allow for at most 1 consonant in their onset position, 727 allow for at most 2 onset consonants, 229 allow for at most 3 consonants, 15 allow for at most 4 consonants, and 2 allow for at most 6 consonants (note that they have no languages in their sample with at most 5 onset consonants). Let's also look at how many consonants can be in a coda. They again sample from 2,338 languages. Of these, 485 languages do not allow for coda consonants, 1,373 allow for at most 1 coda consonant, 358 allow for at most 2 coda consonants, 107 allow for at most 3 coda consonants, 12 allow for at most 4 coda consonants, and 3 allow for at most 5 coda consonants. With this in mind, I think it's likely that what we're seeing in the rest of the world--where "familiar" languages allow for complex onsets and codas--is actually a result confirmation bias. Indo-European languages, for instance, with the exception of highly divergent languages like English or Russian, really only allow for at most 2 or 3 onset consonants (2s include Armenian, Spanish, and Punjabi; and 3s include Albanian, Irish, and Lithuanian). In most of the world's languages, a CV structure is preferred. This is, as far as I'm aware, a very old typological generalization. The Universals Archive cites Jakobson and Hale (1956) as the first statement of this structure being a linguistic universal. 

We can derive from (1) a true sentence if we replace the pronoun she by the definite description the witch reported on in the Gotham Star, but this definite description may not be available to any of the participants in the conversation (perhaps none of them reads the newspapers). The point is that the sentence in (1) may be true even if all the sentences derived from it by replacing she with a contextually available definite description are false. 

The question your teacher gave you has already been discussed by Barbara Partee in her introductory paper ‘Lexical Semantics and Compositionality’ (see reference at the end) - only she used almost half empty and almost half full. If we assume that the constituent structure of both expressions is as in (1), and also make the assumption in (2), the question then arises how come the two expressions differ in meaning. 

Hope all can agree that mistakes can be made at any level of proficiency. The level(s) of competence needed to make a reasonable claim for bi-/multilingualism are of course flexible but can to some degree be measured. One example is the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) but there are other applicable standards. As to the error rates based on the number of languages spoken, I guess you're referring to the speaker's best language(s). Errors made in a second(+) language would seem to only be a crude measure of how well that language is known. I haven't seen this precise question studied but it's somewhat similar to the question of whether bilingual children develop language skills later than their monolingual counterparts. It seems to have been the conventional wisdom that there is a delay but studies have not shown this conclusively. This of course doesn't mean that errors rates in primary language are also comparable but I would doubt that the effect is large. 

I would argue that it's almost certainly the case that it is all subjective. Some of this might have to do with the mapping of speech sounds to the orthography. Sure, you could say that some varieties of Spanish are closer to the ideal that Spanish orthography presents, but none aren't immune to some difference. And what do you even do with English, where the orthography doesn't map very well to the phonology in any variety. And to provide a good counter-example, competency in Celtic languages, as well as Nivkh, is measured in part by native speakers with initial mutations serving as a proxy. For instance, when a definite noun (including proper nouns) are in the genitive case, they lenite. So Cáit [kaːtʲ] 'Kate' > muintir Cháit [ˈmˠɪnʲ.tʲəɾʲ xaːtʲ] 'Kate's family'. Speakers with good command of the morphosyntactic-phonological conditioning for these mutations are viewed as good speakers of the traditional variety. Less competent speakers aren't able to do this as accurately, and are viewed as speaking "Standard Irish" (which is very much not the prestige variety in this respect) (Ó hIfearnáin and Ó Murchadha 2011). 

Perhaps a bit informal but the introduction to The Princeton Companion to Mathematics includes a rather nice discussion of the grammar of mathematics. 

As onomatopoeia, the words used for animal sounds are often quite similar across many languages. However, there are non-trivial differences, even for something as common as the croak of a frog. I was wondering if these differences could generally be grouped (or explained) according to language family or if it's basically just chance (eg, the term that caught on due to some local story or song). Another way to put this is to ask to what extent the animals actually sound different to speakers of different languages (without getting too philosophical). 

I might also add to the discussion the question of grammatical function. In theories that include the specification of grammatical function (subject, object, etc.) in the syntactic representations they posit, the question arises what grammatical functions can be realized by non-finite VPs (or clauses). There is a discussion of this question by Rodney Huddleston in Chapter 14 of The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language (pp. 1206-1220). He argues that non-finite clause complements in English usually do not realize the object function (which is mainly realized by NPs), but a different function, which he dubs catenative complement. A discussion of the grammatical functions of finite clause complements across several languages can be found in the paper “The grammatical functions of complement clauses” by Mary Dalrymple and Helge Lødrup (which can be found on the second author’s webpage). In case you might find it useful, here is a tree for your sentence that follows by and large the syntactic framework in The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language.
