I've added this extra background so you understand the tone I'm aiming for. Think: Tom Clancy-esque Cold War era cat-and-mouse thriller, but the co-operating Soviet agent is a robot. 

The drawback is that machines will expose humans as moral frauds. As with robot labor and computer-controlled flight (and soon: automated cars) the only problem is that machines perform better than humans. In Jonathan Heidt's book The Righteous Mind, he says "intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second." In otherwords, people react with prejudice, then later they justify their knee-jerk opinion by making up a logical explanation for it. That's the reverse of how morality should work. 

I don't plan to delve into the science of how it was created, other than to casually mention that squatters moved in and over many generations repurposed the structure. The upper cells that are longest inhabited are probably "dead" now, but deeper underground cells still function and collect fresh water. The whole structure is haphazardly riddled with manmade tunnels and drainage pipes, something between an ant hill and a sewer world below, and on top a dense little kasbah city looking something like Shibam in Yemen. 

Water "sticks together" because the hydrogen ions are constantly being shared with neighboring water molecules. Surface tension is even stronger than the normal water bond because the molecules at the edge of the liquid can't share ions in all directions, so they bond even more to the molecules they can touch. 

It's not difficult to see how an addict could arrive at ANY pretext to see others punished, and how that could be deliberately stoked into a frenzy leading to witch trials, lynchings, hate rallies, road rage, online harassment, etc. Human morality is a sham. 

After a politically destabilizing incident that could lead to a regional war, a sentient android from a foreign government has offered to help the navy track down a space pirate turned fanatical warlord. A simplistic political sketch of the three "sides" (from the POV of the Navy characters): 

This has been attempted in the US as a form of voter surpression by proxy. Actual examples of the test are available online (one example from Louisiana is here). As you can see from the sample below, it is actually a typical IQ test of "puzzles". 

Put in simple terms, while using a tool the brain believes the tool is an extension of the arm (photo is from link above). Remove the tool and the brain has a lingering distorted perception of the body's shape. A scientist Alessandro Farné has published his research but unfortunately I only found it behind a paywall. A google search will lead you to pop-science articles and summaries of the research. The brain creates a dynamic bodymap for motor control, and this map will update to include a sword at the end of your arm, Crutches as an extension of your "legs", and the full size of a car when you are driving (“Car Body” Phenomenon). FWIW, the location of this map in the brain is likely the cortical homunculus. "Awareness" of the wings is in the brain, not in the wing's nerve endings. As when you drive a car, the actual mechanics of pulling levers and pushing on pedals becomes unconscious. You just focus on "driving" – that is, you just think about maneuvering through traffic using your spatial awareness and senses, no different (at least consciously) than running through a crowd. Meanwhile your brain has broken down dozens of arbitrary mechanical activities into muscular control (rotate a wheel to turn left), and is adapting your sensory information to the specific task (visual distance to the next car, the sound and vibration of the tires on the road). Learning to operate a bicycle, is mentally very different from riding a bicycle. Once you learn it you don't think about it anymore. With your wings, the flyer's brain has to learn to operate the wings and interpret the sensory information for the task. The actual signal from the nerves are simplistic (like a repetitive tapping noise), and there might not be much signal difference when feeling the tip of the wing graze against furniture and the wing vibrating from an updraft during flight, but the brain will interpret those nerve signals very differently while walking around the room or flying. Other senses play an enormous role in confirming sensory information too. Your flyer's brain will be interpreting the feeling of wind on the skin, the sound of the air rushing past, the pull of muscles on the wings, as well as visual cues to determine speed, height, balance, etc. The whole brain works together to coordinate the sensory information, so your artificial nerves might be simpler than you think. 

Any companion moons will have complicated movement across the sky (pardon my artwork) alternately growing brighter and disappearing at times from the sky, although moons are unlikely to be as dramatically large as in my artwork. (Space is very big, and moons are small.) Your moon would probably not have it's own moon, at least nothing round, but it might be in a complicated co-orbital relationship to another moon which is nearly in the same orbit. A co-orbital moon would appear to approach from one side then drift away, only to reappear years later on the other side of the sky. 

The first strategy is likely to get many of both crews killed, and it's possible the prey's crew will destroy their ship if the battle is not going well and they assume they will be killed anyway. The pirates also need TWO complete crews – maybe not a big deal if their prey is a small yacht, but another large ship needs experienced crewmates. Back in the buccaneer days, common sailors were so badly treated that it wasn't difficult to get them to join the pirates when given the option to mutiny, in fact many pirates were former navy. Still, this is the least likely of the strategies to be successful, and certainly the most dangerous for the pirates. The second strategy might be as simple as driving the ship off course, or forcing them to burn fuel to stay out of gun range until they no longer have enough fuel or forward momentum to get to their destination. Every course correction would be a drain, until it is easier to give the pirates what they want (money, cargo, wealthy passengers) to let them go free: the equivalent of cooperating with highway robbers. You pirates aren't going to defeat anyone with damaged ships. They already have lower technology and resources. They might be better off stealing money and ransoming aristocrats to BUY a working used ship, than attempting to repair a ship they'd already almost destroyed. 

Even in a utopian/socialist future where a residential megastructure also serves a utilitarian function, there is a negotiated balance between space devoted to industry and space devoted to community housing. Those needs might change over time leading to overcrowding or reclaiming of industrial space. Was the dam financed by luxury condos, or is this low-income project housing in exchange for pollution credits? 

Go ahead and read every answer from the other question, and swap out Education for IQ. As I'm writing, all 17 answers state problems ranging from ineffectiveness to human rights violations. There are no utopian answers, and I'm sure it won't be any different for your question. In short: you can't create an egalitarian society by enforcing a system of inequality. It is quite simply moving the wrong direction. You would hand power to the already privileged and punish the already disenfranchised. You would have a more divided society. Your state is condoning discrimination which would spill over to every aspect of the Have-Nots' lives. They would have segregated housing, lower-quality schools, poorer-paying jobs. Individuals would take it upon themselves to prevent them from marrying outside of their own kind. They would be denied home and business loans, and only receive credit at higher interest rates. Their neighborhoods would have lead pipes, higher crime, lower property value. It would take longer to get their children out of poverty, exacerbating the problem with paying for the required education. Even if education is "free" poor people have other critical time and financial obligations. They work more hours, commute further distances, they have a higher burden from elder and childcare, their labor is more physically taxing – this is all on top of the job and credit burdens you have given them. The poor do not have the luxury to take more college courses, even if they are technically gratis. The new underclass would stagnate at best, and revolt at worst. You have made them second class citizens with little hope of advancement other than bribing their way through a higher education system. Why participate in a system that treats you unfairly? They would give up, since there is no incentive to try harder. Many would see organized crime as a better opportunity than playing by the rules. This has happened again and again from inner-city ghettos to the Soviet Union. Your educated oligarchs would be further separated from the underclass and create laws that favor themselves. Even if they were well-intentioned they would be ignorant of the reality the underclass faces. Look at higher education today. How much time is devoted now to teaching everyone how to help the disenfranchised? With fewer and fewer actually represented in education and positions of power, they would quickly become society's "other" to blame for everything no matter how ridiculous. Educated people are not magically free of prejudice, especially when we're talking about the uneducated. You wouldn't get Go and spelling bees on TV. The boob tube, the great pacifier, television would be all gladiator sports and football. Soap operas and celebrity gossip. Bread and circuses to keep them entertained and distracted from revolt (educated people read books), and when that revolt eventually comes it would ripple throughout the world just as the American and French Revolutions sparked debate about the inalienable Rights of Man, fairness in the Rule of Law, and the inevitable abuses of a ruling class. 

Could a solar flare be coaxed from a star with a magnetic weapon, possibly by manipulating magnetic reconnection? Could the resulting flare be aimed at a planet (or space fleet) with any accuracy? I understand that a solar flare will not "fry" a planet, but I am hoping for a portable weapon that would cause extreme mayhem and disruption (not planetcide). By portable, I mean it can be transported and deployed from a ship, or the weapon is the whole ship. A NASA video about the coronal mass ejection event in 2012 suggests that repeated flares, or co-ordinated flares could be more damaging. Could this weapon (or ship) survive the flairs or possibly get out of the way to fire again and again? Technology level is thousands of years in the future. My story is set in an Electric Universe where electromagnetism is a stand-in for magic, but I'd like to get a reality-check before I add the handwavium. 

It is not feasible. Planets have cores, they are not all goo inside like a jelly donut. Lava would not cycle through it like a perpetual fountain. Even if you had a heavy glacier pressing down on the night side, it would only squish mantel under the nearby crust (glacial rebound), but it wouldn't push lava out the other side. The most volcanic object in our system is Io. It's stretched and squashed by tidal forces, not solar baking. So you are looking for a planet that is not tidally locked, but tidally ravaged. Especially if we're going to see the lava leaking out from big dramatic sores. Maybe it could have a resonance orbit like Mercury: 

Robots are expensive. Humans are cheap and self-replicating. As mentioned in other answers, robots can be hacked and reprogrammed. But the interesting part is humans stick to their programming when the going gets tough, and remain loyal to "bad" leaders even to the extreme of genocide denial. If you withhold sensitive secrets from an AI you will eventually get errors in your strategy simulations, or worse the AI could expose some mathematical or accounting cover-up that will need to be corrected holographically throughout the information system. It's going to be difficult to keep these political "corrections" unknown by programmers and technicians. If the robots have any ability to form their own math-based strategies and analyze their own success rate, they will eventually discover these manipulations or make lethal errors in decisions. Consider HAL-9000 who decided to kill the crew and scientists to protect the classified purpose of the Jupiter mission. Notice the humans in the same film did their jobs and didn't ask questions. With humans you get blind loyalty and suicide missions. They will continue to defend a lost cause, and their martyrdom can be used as recruitment propaganda – not all humans obviously, but the military has ways of weeding out independent thinkers by self-selecting for conformity, compliance, and obedience. You probably wouldn't do this if you could actually win with a robot army, so I'd suggest this is an underdog strategy. Having an all human army defending against an army of robots and drones also works as a human shield strategy. Global sympathy will go to humans in a propaganda war of humans vs bots. Our military future however will be effected by what the military calls Tooth-to-Tail Ratio which refers to a logistics issue involving the resources required to supply and support (tail) each combat soldier (tooth). The actual ratio varies over time and by mission, but it's typical to spend double the resources on the tail than the teeth. DARPA has a stated goal of developing technology to reduce the tail, so expect AI and drones to become more valuable in supplying combat soldiers than AI becoming combat soldiers. It sounds counter-intuitive, but that is where the finances should lead us. In a not-so-far future scenario an AI will probably design global defense strategy based on simulations, and AI may become more reliable and cheaper than generals. We'll have the awkward scenario of human infantry commanded by machine intelligence. 

The biggest hazard will be flying metal. You can find many industrial injuries listed online where a hand or finger was caught between metal and a magnet. I'm not going to link to medical photos. Magnets can effect people directly, possibly headaches and seizures, but for a person to be harmed at the cellular level by a magnetic field might be many orders of magnitude beyond what is being discussed here. It's hard for me to say, because the paper doesn't mention the strength or hazards of standing directly next to the magnetic cable. Reports of cellular damage is measured in thousands of Teslas, a Tesla is 10,000 Gauss. G in this case stands for guass. 5 G is a safety standard for static magnetic fields. A safety zone is drawn at the 5 G distance. Beyond that line metal needs to be removed from clothing, tools secured, etc. Magnetic Field Safety Guide 

I'm having no luck researching this topic so my terms may be wrong or my entire premise faulty. I have found a related question that might be a corollary: "Can I kill a cyborg with magnetism?" My setting is the distant future where sentient androids exist. They are electro-mechanical with no biological parts. I am writing under the assumption they would be susceptible to electromagnetic fields (EM weapons, superconductors, etc). Under intense magnetism their bodies will seize up, but in time they often recover because their skull and "bones" shield their nervous system. My question is about an alternate design of android that would be passive to magnetic forces, or otherwise resistant to the harmful effects. They are designed to operate within shifting magnetic fields inside a superconducting machine. My idea is that they are built on a similar skeletal frame that shields their nervous system, but their outer bodies are not susceptible to magnetism. They still function, think, and ambulate under conditions that would paralyze the normal androids. Can an android's body be "immune" to electromagnetic forces? And to prevent a world-breaking technology, why wouldn't all androids be made with this kind of body? What are the limits and trade-offs that make traditional electromechanical bodies "better" and these specialized bodies only suitable under specific environments?
