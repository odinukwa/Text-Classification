You are carefully describing the position of the ball in the moment of your attack hit and in the moment of the defensive contact. However, it is not important. The decisive criterion in this case is not the point of contact with the ball, but the position of the blocker’s body. If any part of the blocker’s body (usually but not necessarily hands) is higher than the top of the net, it is considered a block. See Rule 14.1.1 Blocking (emphasis mine): 

We are talking about the last point in this case. And, in the official interpretation of the Laws of the Game (p. 102), it is defined thus: 

) I did not find any more stringent criteria. The more general International Ski Competition Rules define the following for slalom races (and similarly for the other race types): 

But if the back-row setter touches the ball within his own playing area (or, theoretically, above the free zone, if the ball is overflying the net partially or completely outside the antennae), and plays it “backwards” into his own half of the court or parallel to the net or his teammate touches the ball prior to the ball crossing the net completely and prior to any blocking opponent touching the ball, it is valid play. Relevant rules (see FIVB Official Volleyball Rules 2015-2016): 

I was reading this article today about the weird situation that came up with the Ghanian national team at the 2014 World Cup, and I realized that I'd never heard about other player's compensation when playing for their national team. Is it common for players to be paid to play for their national teams? You hear about players being excited to play for their country, but I never accounted for additional pay (which I assume is usually going to be much smaller than they would normally be making for their club team). 

My understanding of the financial fair play rule from UEFA is that clubs can't spend more money then they take in from ticket sales, sponsorships, media deals, etc. The goal being to prevent a super rich owner from coming in and dumping loads of money into a team to buy all the good players and keep everyone else from getting a chance at them. As I watch this happen though, I'm wondering how this is actually fair to the smaller clubs. The big clubs will continue to make millions and millions from sponsorship deals that the smaller clubs won't have a chance to get unless they somehow can break into that elite group. If you use the EPL as an example, the best teams in the league have pretty much always been the same (or at least for the last 25 or so years since the silly amounts of money have been poured into the game). There isn't really a chance for even a medium level team like West Brom or Hull to break into the top 4 long term because they won't be able to keep their best players, even if they have a rich owner swoop in a give them millions. So what makes this rule fair? Or am I missing the point of the rule? 

But he cannot continue playing so, and definitely cannot “assume the risk of injury”. Note that there is an offense of playing “in a dangerous manner” which includes possible injury to the player himself, and which is penalized by an indirect free kick. (But that is purely theoretical, I believe; normally, should the player attempt playing barefoot, the referee would instruct him to correct his equipment.) 

There are only two (different) actions when you are permitted to reach beyond (over) the net: blocking and attack hit. 

First of all, it’s far from “any touch of the net is a fault”. The actual rule (11.3.1) is that “Contact with the net by a player between the antennae, during the action of playing the ball, is a fault.” (emphasis mine). The next paragraph explains the action of playing the ball includes take-off, hit (or attempt), and landing. That includes touches by the attacking player, the player blocking him, etc., but it excludes e.g. a blocker on the opposite side of the net who was confused by a fake attack. Even though he wanted to block the ball, his contact was not a fault, as he was actually not near the ball, so he was not in the action of playing it. Also, it excludes touches made when not playing the ball at all. For instance, if a blocker lands and then turns, touching the net with his shoulder, it is not a fault, the touch has not occurred during the action of playing the ball. However, if a player interferes with the play, even outside the action of playing the ball, that is a fault. (For instance, a player tripping and then using the net for support.) As for the specific question you ask: if the ball flies into the net causing it to hit a stationary player on the opposite side, it is not a fault. However, if the player has deliberately moved his hands close to the net to alter the rebound of the ball (preventing the opponent from recovering the ball from the net in case of remaining team hits), I believe this could be called a net fault. (It would definitely be a net fault in beach volleyball.) 

Now, if we want to transform this 4-4-2 to a standard 3-5-2 we only have to move some players. First, and most important, one of the Center Backs is re-positioned as a Defensive Midfielder. This causes a big gap in the center of the field, which is catched by moving your Full-Backs closer to the center (they're actually becomming normal backs now). The last problem that has to be catched now is the center midfield, which is to heavily occupied. We catch this by moving the 2 Central Midfielders to the wings. Now our standard 3-5-2 is created: 

A tactic where short passing is the main cause. Especially useful for teams without tall strikers. A tactic where the long ball is played to very tall strikers. This tactic is played a lot by the more fysical teams. This is why this tactic is quite popular in the English Premier League. 

For me every formation can be traced back to one of the two basic formations: 4-3-3 and 4-4-2. All the other formations are just another interpretation of player roles here, or just another way of setting the players (for instance, playing with a defensive midfielder instead of a attacking midfielder). This in my opinion makes a lot more sense since a team always has to react on situations during the match. An example: Real Madrid mostly plays a almost classis 4-3-3 formation, with Marcelo as their left full-back. In the Primera Division, Real is almost always the better team, resulting in a lot of possesion, so Marcelo can stand much deeper (almost playing as a midfielder or even a winger). But when Real is playing against Barcelona, we mostly see Barca in possesion, so Marcelo has to think defensively more and thus will stand less deep than when having much possesion. You see that in this case, the formation in possesion can almost be described as being a 3-4-3 formation, while not being in possesion yields a 4-3-3 formation. The main difference between 4-3-3 and 4-2-2 is the number of strikers. Where 4-3-3 in most cases uses one striker and two wingers (nowadays mostly cutting inside), 4-2-2 uses 2 strikers. I will give an example using the 4-4-2 formation and transform it to a 3-5-2: 

How are “unclean hits” judged in tennis? I mean situations like a ball slipping on a racket, or unintentionally hitting the racket twice (e.g. when the player does not hold the racket firmly enough). In the official rules, I have found rule 24 (f), stating the point is lost if “The player deliberately carries or catches the ball in play on the racket or deliberately touches it with the racket more than once” (emphasis mine). Does this mean unintentional double touches or prolonged contact are fine? Also, my friends debated whether hits by the rim are allowed or not. As I have found no mention about that in the rules, I suppose hits by any part of the racket (not only the strings) are allowed. Is that correct? 

Which means the answer for your first question is no, this is not a dig. And the answer for your second question is yes, this is still a dig, even though the attack was slowed by the block. Other official bodies or specific competitions might use a different definition, but I believe the basic principles would be the same. 

However, UEFA (the European football association) uses a different system in its competitions, where results from the matches between the teams concerned are given more importance than the results from the rest of the group matches (plus, there are more auxiliary criteria when everything else fails). See e.g. the official Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2012 which state in the rule 8.07: 

It seems to indicate that if you're a supporter (I assume possibly an away supporter), you shouldn't be wearing team colors. That seems a bit ridiculous to me, not only as an American sports fan, but as someone who has watched any sporting event ever. Is this really the case? What are they trying to accomplish? Don't they already separate the supporters within the stadium with security and/or walls? 

I was just browsing on Stubhub because I was curious what tickets for a Manchester United game go for when this popped up: 

All calls in volleyball eventually come from the head referee. However, he or she can ask their assistants for assistance if they didn't have a good view of the play. If the referee cannot make a decision based on their own view and those of the assistants, calling a replay is perfectly fine. It's similar to basketball. When the officials cannot decide the correct outcome of a play, they sometimes call a "jump ball" to determine the outcome. 

This question may apply to other leagues in other places, but recently I saw an article about Radamel Falcao playing for the Manchester United U-21 team and Rafael doing the same thing. Both players are over 21 and make semi-regular starts for the Manchester United senior squad. How are they also allowed to play for the U-21 reserve team when they're obviously over-age? 

(Edited per amended question. TL;DR: the setter made a fault of “reaching beyond the net”, signalled by the referee by a hand placed above the net, palm facing downwards.) 

Update: The below answer was valid at the time it was posted, however, the rules changed dramatically, and now any contact with the net by a player between the antennae, during the action of playing the ball, is a fault. (With explicit inclusion of the take-off and landing in the action of playing the ball.) Therefore, per the current rules, both sample situations are now faults. 

Fouls are called only for offences which are committed by a player on the field of play while the ball is in play. (See Interpretations of the Laws of the Game and Guidelines for Referees, page 117.) If the ball is out of play because the play was stopped by the referee because of a previous offence, no free kick is given, only the persons involved in the misconduct may be cautioned or sent off. So, in your example, the Team B player will be sent off, however, the play will be restarted with the original free kick for Team B. (Similarly, free kicks are not awarded for misconduct by e.g. a manager, nor for a misconduct of a player outside the field of play. If the referee needs to stop the play because of such misconduct, no team will be given a free kick, and the play will be restarted with a dropped ball at the position of the ball at the time the play was stopped.)
