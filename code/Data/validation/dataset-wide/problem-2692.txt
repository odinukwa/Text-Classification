It depends on what racism is supposed to mean in such cases. For example, it would be racist to say that all blacks are/do x, with x often being something that is bad. 'My friend is black and all blacks steal' is no contradiction, so for now you could say racist things and still have a black friend. But I think the idea behind such statements is that they would want to add another premise, namely: 'I am not friends with people who steal/do bad stuff' Now consider the argument again. If you are not friends with people who steal, then all your friends do not steal. So you can't truthfully utter something like 'All blacks steal' while having a black friend. Thus, as long as friendship excludes the bad stuff and if you take racist statements to be universally quantified, this tactic works. But neither the former nor the latter have to be true. (Although racists could think they are true). 

Is the notion of truth-valuelessness accepted among contemporary philosophers, or is bivalence generally perceived as incontrovertible dogma? No, there are various papers on truthvalue gaps, and a section about logics with more than two truthvalues can be found here: SEP Truth Values. To name but one example, Graham Priest in his 'In Contradiction' argues against truth value gaps, see chapter 1.3. is it thought that truth is a disjoint metaphysical entity existing outside of thought? There isn't really any agreement. The introductory books, judged form my personal experience, take truth to be a property of proposistion/sentences/utterances. For more on this debate though, see the SEP article again, sections: Truth as a property versus truth as an object, and: The ontology of truth values. 

I read the Theory of Justice and looked into Law of Peoples. It did not seem to be the same theory, but merely related or another part of it (contrary to what SEP writes). My Question then is: What is the relation between the different books. Is it restating/refining the theory in each book, so it would be enough to read the latest? Is it for each part of the theory an own book? If I want to understand Justice as Fairness as a whole, which books do I have to put on my table? 

How I understand the question: Humans are composed of molecules. Is there an entity, John, that overlaps each molecule additionally to all the molecules (that hes made of)? Different answers depending on your view of the world: Nihilism: No, there are just the very small things, probably smaller than molecules (quarks etc.), and those are the only things that exist. If there are bunches of matter, we only count all the little things the bunch is composed of, and not the bunch. According to the Nihilist, strictly speaking, John does not exist, there are just mereological atoms arranged John-wise. Van Inwagen-Nihilism: Everything is either a small thing without proper parts (probably quarks etc.) or a living thing. According to this view, John exists, but your chair does not. One result here is that existence (as identity) is vague. Monism: There is just one thing, The Universe, which has no parts. It is a 'seamless one'. And therefore John does not exist. The Universe is just John-ish there-ish. Classical Mereology: John exists, tables exist, chairs exist...But also the thing composed of your nose and the Eiffel-Tower does exist. Here also problems with existence and identity arise. The ship of Theseus, the gold statue that is melted, Cats whose tails get cut off, to name a few. *Note that these are big theories summarized in just a few words. If something sounds very stupid or more interesting, just look for more e.g. in the SEP

Edit: More on truth So on one common view those things that can be true are propositions. So a meaningful exression would be: The proposition that snow is white is true. If you believe that sentences are the things that can be true, then this would be an example: The sentence "Grass is green" is true. Most people believe that facts cannot be true: They think that "(The fact that grass is green) is true" is a weird thing to say. (I use brackets to make clear that the predicate "is true" refers to the fact. Because otherwise there could be a second reading about the (fact that grass is green is true), if there is such a fact) To conclude:(i) There is the fact that grass is green, and (ii) the proposition that grass is green is true. Also it is worth pointing out that there are philosophers who say that there are no facts, because facts are weird ontological things and maybe you can do without them. So this is just one way to answer this question. 

The quote about facts gets it pretty right. A fact is, for many philosophers, a part of reality (Russel, for example). So as there are people and tables and chairs in our world, there is also the fact that I am sitting on the chair. It is as real as the chair itself. You often see some kind of brackets when someone speaks about fact, so for example: < I am sitting on a chair> converts to "The fact that I am sitting on a chair". Truth is a property of sentences, propositions, utterances, whatever you like. Facts can therefore not be true, in the same way as a chair cannot be true. Stating a fact, however, and depending on your opinion, has a truthvalue. I think the second quote about truth is a bit problematic. It sounds as if good arguments alter reality. But arguments cannot be true, they can be valid, and they can be truthconserving. So if I have an argument for the existence of god, it is at best valid. That does not mean, however, that suddenly, in virtue of the good argument, god came into existence. 

I don't think that B has made a fallacy. What A is really saying (imho) is this: (1)If Biologically men and women are different then it shouldn't surprise they have different salary on average. It is a conditional. Additionally, A is also stating that the antecedent is true. (2) Biologically men and women are different. Now what B does is to say that while (2) is true, (1) is not true. 

In the introductory course I took we started with an article by Ruse: 'Creation Science is not Science. He talks about what a scientific theory really is and presupposes no technical stuffs and stays on a very general level. It may be too broad, though. Here is a link to the article: $URL$ 

You seem to claim that something that cannot be verified empirically is beyond the understanding of science and probably not useful. Mathematics cannot be verified empirically, but is very helpful. Why do I think that mathematics cannot be verified empirically? First of all, it is an open question what mathematics is about. Whatever numbers are, a lot of them, indeed, infinitely many of them, are larger than the amount of stuff in the universe. (Of course, there are philosophers, and especially metaphysicians, that work on those questions. Some think that mathematics can be verified empirically, see for example Maddy) One branch of metaphysics is modality. Something is science, you seem to suggest, if it makes verifiable claims. Which is just to say that it has to be possible to verify it. The nature of possibility belongs in the realm of metaphysics. And working on modality helps us to pin down what is verifiable and what is not. If that is your demarcationline between science and non-science, working on metaphysics is useful. Furthermore, I don't think that your claim is true in the first place. Science, for example theoretical physics, makes claims that are not empirically verifiable (at least not yet). Example: Theoretical Physics makes assumptions about what is in a black hole, but it is impossible for us to go into a black hole and make our observations. But theoretical physics is still useful I'd say.
