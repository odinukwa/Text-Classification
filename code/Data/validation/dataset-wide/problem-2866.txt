The basic premise of "1" is understood, and transcends specific semiotics. If you can differentiate one thing from another to any degree, then you can grasp the basic premise of numerals, and therefore mathematics. 

The proverbial example of what your asking, is illustrated in Socrates's trial and death as described in Plato's "Dialogues". In the story Socrates choices to stay in Athens and stand trial based on his "convictions to the truth and knowledge". And despite being given several opportunities to escape with his life into exile, he chose to argue against his opponent and be executed for it. If you believe that Socrates was a nobel martyr, then proceed to employ the Socratic method towards the opponents credit. In his case, he won the argument at the cost of his life (it should be noted that 400 BC Greek society had different moral, spiritual and social norms). If you can respect Socrates's story but see a cautionary tale of Pride getting best of someone, then you may wish to reflect on one of your initial premises; "your opponent must submit to your belief". Though this is more literary than philosophical, I believe its an apt allusion to the question your asking. I would posit that respecting another includes respecting that the other person may not agree with what your position. Not to be holistic, but perhaps also reflect on the fact that it is an opportunity to test your position in "the natural light" (Rene Descartes, "Meditations on First Philosophy") 

For me, the term free is not some absolute on/off value, it is not either you have it or you don't. Freedom is about the number of choices you have at a point in time, you may have few choices so less freedom or more choices hence more freedom comparatively. Now let's say you have 3 choices at a point in time and you have choose one of them to move forward, then what should be procedure to determine what choice to make? There could be many ways to do that, for example: A lazy person may choose the one which would need less effort to carry out, a greedy person may choose the one which has most benefits in terms monitory gains and so on. Once you have made a choice and move forward you are presented again with a set of choices depending on what you choose at earlier point. This new set of choices may be large or small as compared to the previous one. The equation in the question says that the procedure that so called intelligent agent will use to decide the choice will be based on which choice right now will allow me with larger number of choices in future set of choices. Obviously the future should be some sensible threshold otherwise the agent will never be able to make the current choice. So, yes, you can be free and intelligent at the same time. 

For a more well discussed example of this conundrum, look into some critical analyses of the Francis Field Test (1954 - 1955), where the Polio Vaccine was first tested on the mass public in the United States. 

I think this is a strict programming scenario where "True" is treated as a variable, and not in any philosophical way. For example in VBA "True" is equivalent to -1, while False is equivalent to 0. Other programming languages define "True" as 1. If that is the case with Python, it follows that 1 + 1 > 1. In Philosophy, True + True = True because Truth is not a divisible value. 

To Heidegger, "Being" is neither of your two examples, because they relate to something outside of what it is intrinsically in it-self. However, a hindu Brahman is "Being", when they are practicing their beliefs and striving towards joining Brahma. Just as a Carpenter is "Being", when he is doing carpentry. Unlike your two examples - where the actors are striving to join a unity of being or ultimate entity - it is not "to what ends" that concerns Heidegger, it is "acting in accordance to the self" that is important. 

I would recommend looking into Professor Bennet Helm. Free will and the nature of how we define it is his primary academic study. Link to item description The book, "Emotional Reason: Deliberation, Motivation, and the Nature of Value", poses that free will is a product of emotional attitudes, and not reliant of higher intellect. Prof. Helm has also used this in discussions as a distinction that defines the difference between the free will that an animal may exhibit versus that of higher order intelligence by discussing first and second orders of volition - I think that this can be extended as far as to include all forms of life in varying degrees if autonomous volition. Therefore, this also addresses a divid between intellect and free will. You can have a massive intellect (like a computer), but without emotions you will not exercise free will. However, there are actually a few high functioning Artificial Intelligence experiments currently active. BINA48 Tay Most of these are targeted at passing the Turing Test 

Yes, it is possible and reason for it depends on the temporal nature of existence and "why". To empirically find that something exist would require a less temporal scale as compared to find why that something exist. The question of why can go on way too far in the past or way too far in the future. So basically you can find the existence in very small time scale whereas "why" would require much larger time scale to get answered. For example: You could come to know the existence of something on your table as soon as you look but to reason why it exist would require you to spend more time as compared to "just looking at it". For some moments you will know the existence of the object on the table without knowing why. 

You may or you may not reach to the eventual point. We just don't know yet. We are severely limited in our abilities to figure this out. Science says if you observe something, try to find what caused it and what caused that cause and so on. If at the first cause itself you start to believe that there is no cause of it then you have basically blocked yourself at that point for further exploration and experimentation. Look at the history and you will find people whole believed that they know the "starting point" (i.e some form of the word God) were the one who were against the scientific approach. Science never says that there is or there is no "eventual starting point". It only says "We don't know, so lets just keep exploring, keep theorizing and keep proving" 

This is a question of whether the Ends justify the Means. The value of taking a Utilitarian position is that you focus on the Ends, which you calculate as having a great value. However, in cases where the Means inflicts harm, how do you measure the short term impact versus the long term benefits? It depends on the priority and arrangement of social and political norms, as well as an individual's personal ethical or practical dispositions. Utilitarianism can require consent, either explicitly or tacitly, as long as that is a factor in quantifying the "utiles" you are comparing. Utilitarianism has many variations, but one could reasonably consider a society that upheld explicit consent as one of its highest tenets. In this world, a key factor of maximization would be to ensure consent is given before any action. i.e. Based on a strictly utilitarian understanding; If we were to say that no doctor may treat a patient without explicit consent. Then it is a utilitarian imperative that the doctor cease treatment, since consent is tantamount to any treatment. However, an alternate society could put less weight in individual consent and prefer advancement or obedience. In these societies, consent is secondary, if even considered. i.e. Based on strict utilitarian understanding; Obedience in the military and respect of the chain of command exceeds any consent from lower ranking officers. 

The explanation of something should have one important property - inference i.e given some facts what other facts I can infer about the thing using the explanation. That's the sole reason for the explanation/theory to exist. The thing itself that we are trying to explain is a bunch of facts that we can observe or observed but facts themselves are doesn't have inference ability until used along with some explanation. Now, what if the explanation is complex? What can we say about the inference ability of a complex explanation? The complexity will lead to the increase in the number of inferences the explanation could potentially produce BUT what if the explanation is more complex then the thing (or the collections of facts) themselves? In this case the explanation will infer facts that you can't even observe in the thing itself and that obviously is very weird. 

Something can exist but never be created, until we know what lead to its creation. We humans have this notion that if there exist something than someone or some phenomena must have created that thing. When you see something you will always wonder what created this thing? In that case you can choose any of the below path: 

Check out Appeal to emotion. This seems to best describe the conversation, where the use of word friendship is to focus on emotion than facts. 

At the root of the question, Objectivists reject absolute socialism because it requires the explicit commitment (though often acquired through tacit consent) of an entire society. It also sets many limitations on pursuing personal needs, in lieu of a collective equality. Theoretically, this collective equality is supposed to provide a greater collective freedom, since those with not enough are liberated from their strife. However, a strict socialist economy wholly rejects Capitalist behaviors because they contradict the required collective commitments of Socialist economics. Oppositely, socialist behavior isn't outright rejected by Capitalism. Capitalism endorse a freedom to choose, relying on the "invisible hand" of the free market to create the equilibrium of the social and economic distribution of goods, services and capital. This freedom allows anyone to act out their socialist ideals, though they may not be the most effective or sustainable method. In this way its clear why an Objectivist, who values that freedom to act in one's own best interests, would support a system that emphasizes personal freedom, over collective freedom. 

I believe that the phrase explains that beauty in aesthetics is an a priori knowledge that is simultaneously the highest positive value and personification of truth. Aesthetics is an experiential phenomena that is external to ourselves and, ostensibly, is an appreciation for the truth of beauty (which is perceived as a universal concept in the author's theory). It is not related to one's person satisfaction, but an a priori truth and value accessed through this appreciation. Therefore, it is intrinsically "unselfed". 

A lot of people in science talks about science as a discipline to find the fundamental laws or rules of the nature. They consider these laws to be the underlying mechanism that is making the nature as it is. Usually they will use mathematics equations to describe these so called fundamental laws. Now if you say that a particular mathematical equation describe the trajectory of a ball and this law is the underlying mechanism then who in the nature is actually computing the equation? Is it the ball, the particles, the earth, the air? Well the answer is nobody and that's what makes the whole argument of "underlying laws" or "how nature works" wrong. I guess the proper way to address all the scientific knowledge (or any knowledge for that matter) about nature would be that it is about coming up with "generalized representations" of the observations i.e it just "describe" the observations and it doesn't mean to find how nature actually works. 

We can carry on this process until there is no further substitutions to make. Well, that condition won't ever come in this case as this is plain old infinite recursion due to self reference. If you can't reach a condition where no further substitutions can't be made you simply cannot reach a conclusion. In this particular case you cannot say S is true or false. Similarly if you email a person about some information and he never replied (in terms of whether he knows about it or not) for whatever reason, would you say that the person knows the information or he doesn't. 

Yes, exposure to religion can bread zealots, and an innumerable number of battles have been fought on the grounds of religion. But religion is not a modern concept and, historically, religion provides social order. The fact that religions largely co-exist in both historic and modern society, shows that it is not an attribute of a religion but rather something in its practitioners. Below I will cover some primary points about the role religion has played, that are both foundational and promotive of a healthy society. Lets first discuss social order. Niccolo Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Thomas Jefferson all discuss that the first founding principle of establishing any society is the collective acceptance of a Sovereign. Whether by force, faith, or solidarity, the people bind together and submit some degree of personal power to the authority, in exchange for safety and communal progress (i.e. we are more capable together than as individuals). Religion is the perfect force to draw in and unify people. It establishes an authority who is omnipotent, yet intangible. Religion also provides security, strength, purpose and order to society. Marx calls religion the "opiate of the masses" because it can pacify them. If you are in a bad situation, religion tells you to put you're energy into faith, redirecting it from the other common targets like the authority or those who prosper while you suffer. The concept of an afterlife is a great example of this. Death is a very difficult thing for people to do with. It can often lead to very serious anxiety and unrest in a individual and/or society. None of us know what happens to our souls after we die, this unknown can be a metaphysically devastating realization. Some would become Nihilistic, not concerned of their own actions because after death it doesn't matter. This would also be an issue for society. Placed in a historical context, being unable to comfort the masses causes unrest and leads to the collapse of order. Some religions offer solace and comfort through the concept of an afterlife or rebirth. Order is further maintained though the concept of heaven, which both provides people with the concept that this life is not the most important, and that a good member of society (each society being composed of the members of a specific religion) is promised a life of glory, all thanks to the devotion despite suffering in this life. This therefore promotes social order, helps to establish a reasoning behind religious laws, and comforts the struggling masses (early society was certainly a difficult life style and it was newly emerging, without the advantage of being historically informed). Though this is more interpretive, I think that evidence of this function of religion is clearly provided from the existence of the Book of Leviticus. The second book of Judaism and Christianity (and following Genesis, because before you can guide people you need to provide them with some answers like, "Where did we come from>"), this contains 613 commandments that touch on all aspects of social life: 1) Public Health - Leviticus contains the laws for keeping Kosher, avoiding shellfish and swine (both can spoil and cause illness if not cleaned correctly). It also contains instructions on how to prepare, clean and preserve meat. The laws go on to even include how to treat illnesses and sets guidelines for quarantine and treat leapers and other diseases that were both common and devastating to a community if not handled correctly. 2) Civil Law - There are a number of very specific civil laws that establish a common set of guidelines that we all abide within a society. Both crime and punishment are laid out. Excessive punishment is also limited within these laws. There are laws about owning land, "no debt shall be held more than 10 years" (including slavery which was a commonly traded commodity in early society). 3) Social Law - In early society, work was a precious commodity, and the community often relied on all its members to provide different portions of what society required to maintain itself. Laws like those surrounding the process of mourning a death (sitting shiva) are set to provide both a structure to loss, but also a limit. In sitting Shiva, after 40 days it is required that mourning ends and that everyone returns to normal life. Another example are The 10 Commandments, such as honor your parents and do not covet your neighbors wife. These may have been the 9 biggest social issues of early society, and the first commandment which compels to you to obey God and his commandments. Please note that this is primarily Judeo-Christian religious belief. Many "eastern" religions focus on establishing order in "Life" and nature itself, rather than our roles in a society. Other pagan and polytheistic religions focused more on recognizing the limits of humanity compared to the natural forces that immensly powerful (Zeus throws lightning bolts, and Rah is the personification of the Sun). But again, these all provide a rational to fill a void, much of which is still unknown despite human advancement (like the concept of the soul). Unfortunately, with such a powerful historic influence, it will take a long time (if ever) for it to dissipate from mainstream society. The important thing to bare in mind is that religion or not, people will find justification for divisions and disagreements. Religion itself does not necessitate radicalism, and in most religions order within a society is foundational if not the entire underlying ends.
