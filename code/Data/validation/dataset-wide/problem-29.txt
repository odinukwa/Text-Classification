It's almost certain the cloak does not cause the other observer to see two floating spots the size and shape of your retinas. Unless the other observer is standing with their nose inches behind your head, most of the light falling on your retinas comes from objects to which your observer would have a direct line of sight even if you were not wearing the cloak. The only photons that the cloak might need to intercept (and not simply transmit around you) would be the ones that would have struck your corneas in such a way as to pass through the opening in the irises of your eyes. Assuming the cloak passes exactly those photons to your eyes and bends all others around you, the observer would see two perfectly black spots (black being what you see in the absence of any photons) about the size of the openings in your iris (but slightly larger, because the corneas refract light into the openings). But the cloak might take less than 1% of all the photons that would have struck your face, and redirect them onto your corneas so that they produce a correct image of the objects in front of you. From the point of view of an observer behind you, there would be a region about the size of your face in which the brightness of the scene was between 99% and 100% of what it should be. This would be hard to detect even with specialized equipment unless things were arranged so that the equipment can predict exactly what the brightness of each part of the scene should have been. 

As noted in other objects, when you see in a work of science fiction (or in a science report about things we might build in the future) that a large object is rotated in order to create artificial gravity, the mass of that object has nothing to do with the "gravity" that is experienced, nor is the spinning creating any kind of gravitational field in or around the spinning object. What creates the sensation of gravity, if you are in a room within the spinning object, is the fact that the room you are in is traveling along a curved path. The amount of gravity created is purely a function of the radius of curvature of the path the room is following and the speed at which the room travels along that path. You don't need a massive structure with huge rings to get this effect. At least in principle you could build an airtight capsule just around the room you want to be in, attach a long cable (called a tether) to the capsule just "above" the center of the ceiling of your room, attach a suitable counterweight to the other end of the tether, and set the room and counterweight moving so that they sit at each end of the straightened tether and revolve around a point somewhere between them. As this structure traveled through space it would "spin" somewhat like a drum major's baton when it is thrown in the air, but much slower. Such a scheme is discussed here and here. The tether needs to be quite long and there are various engineering challenges to overcome in practice, but if you could overcome them, you could have significant artificial gravity aboard a structure of this kind without causing its occupants to have "spin sickness." The structure would still be "large" if you just look at its overall length, but it would have very little mass and volume, even including the tether and counterweight. 

I've read that if a modern cartridge goes off while it is lying about (not in a tight container), the casing (aka bullet case) is more dangerous than the bullet, because the casing can be propelled like a little rocket. In the confines of a magazine, neither bullet nor casing can go very far unless propelled by great force. As soon as there is a sufficient gap between the casing and the bullet for the gas inside the cartridge to escape, out it goes. The bullet and casing don't even have to move; the gap could occur simply by the expansion of the mouth of the casing. So if you can get a cartridge to go off, the effect will be a lot of hot gases squirting out of various orifices and joints of the handle and frame of the firearm. Whether they do any harm depends on what they hit next. I suppose a military-style leather holster with a flap over the handle of the firearm would probably completely absorb the energy of the gas; it might end up a little singed. If the round goes off while someone is holding the firearm by the handle it might be a very different story. When a revolver is fired, some gas escapes through the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, which can be very dangerous. The gases escaping the round that went off in the handle would be as hot as the gases from the revolver but propelled by less pressure. I'm not sure what the result would be; something between mild burns and amputation is my guess. In any event, if a round went off you'd have a loose bullet and deformed casing in the top of the magazine, which seems pretty sure to cause a jam if the user attempts to load the chamber in the usual way without replacing the magazine first. 

Make it physically and psychologically so difficult to be an inhabitant of the torus that 99% of everyone will not want it, even compared to the hardships on Earth. Start by requiring a long and extremely arduous testing and training period that each prospective applicant has to go through in order to qualify to be sent to the torus. Advertise the difficulty in order to discourage too many applications, and use physical and/or mental tests and hardships to weed out all but the most qualified few from those who do apply. This has the advantage of also providing you with a population for the torus who will be most capable of sustaining it. Don't waste resources making the torus a nice place to live. Maintaining life in space is not naturally easy, and each pound of special equipment you have to manufacture and send up there is expensive. Instead of sending up extra machines to serve everyone's needs and provide luxury living on board the torus, send up more people, naturally putting them all in a situation where they must work hard for their survival. The inhabitants of the torus are there to preserve some remnant of human life and culture from the looming disaster on Earth, not to have fun and enjoy their good fortune. 

The environment you describe removes key problems that drove the development of navigational technology on the Earth, and introduces new problems (including some that are not obvious) in their place. The effect of a horizon One reason (perhaps the big reason) why it's so often so difficult to find your way over long distances at sea is that the Earth itself gets in the way. If you want to go somewhere more than a few dozen miles off-shore you need to have a good way to tell that you're going in the right direction without being able to see either your destination or any other landmark. With your floating islands, this problem disappears. Everything is in line of sight (unless another island is directly in the path, in which case you would want to head to that island first). Finding your way in the dark On the Earth, it gets a lot darker at night than during the day, and things that could have been landmarks are no longer visible. On the other hand, you can see the stars at night. Navigators on Earth learned to navigate by whatever kinds of things they could see, which vary from time to time. In your cluster, there does not appear to be any reason for things to be more or less visible at different times. The Earth's axis of rotation The fact that the Earth rotates and that we can therefore see the apparent motion of several prominent objects (notably the Sun!) from east to west gives some obvious, natural directions for navigation. OK, you've taken this away, which introduces an obvious problem, but perhaps relatively minor compared to the next one. Degrees of freedom of movement The fact that the Earth's gravity gives us obvious "up" and "down" directions is secondary to the fact that it keeps practically everything on the surface of the Earth. Until the development of aircraft (including balloons) there was no vehicle that could even consider traveling up or down. All long-distance travel was basically two-dimensional. In fact, even with modern airliners long-distance travel is nearly two-dimensional; a flight of 3000 nautical miles will rarely get even 8 nautical miles above sea level. Even if you had an obvious naturally directed frame of reference in your cluster, early navigators would have to develop ways of directing their craft that humans have only had to deal with when sending spacecraft to the Moon or to more distant places. Visibility Although you have line-of-sight to practically anywhere you would want to go, the space between you and your destination is still filled with breathable air. The thickness of this layer of air around the Earth is only a few kilometers--11 km up, density is less than 1/4 of that at sea level, 20 km up, it's less than 7%, 32 km up it's less than 1%. So we can still see stars at night. Wikipedia says visibility through air would be limited to less than 300 km even in perfectly clear conditions--and with entire islands floating around in mid-air, it seems likely that other particles would be floating about, too. If the air between islands is really thin, though, that might allow the radius of visibility to be greater than it would have been in a uniformly thick atmosphere. And you have magic. So visibility could be on the order of hundreds of kilometers, less if you allow any kind of clouding or floating particles. You could probably arrange to have visible stars in the distance (maybe only at the distance of the Sun from the Earth--they do have to be bright enough to be visible through all that air). But it sounds like that is not a planned part of your world; it may make more sense for the radius of the cluster to be much larger than the distance anyone can see from any island, even with a strong telescope. The map keeps changing If even a strong storm can move an island significantly, charts can't be very precise. If you could somehow plot the exact direction to an island that was much farther than you can see, it very likely wouldn't be where you expected it to be when you got there. Technology matters--a lot At a very low level of technology I think it is unlikely that navigation would be advanced much beyond having knowledge of which islands are close to which other islands. Since the islands drift, even local "sky charts" would be impractical; but people on each island would either be able to recognize the nearby islands or would know which was which by having tracked their motions across the sky. Directions a sky captain would give would basically be, "See that island there? Go to it." If the island was too far away to see, you probably want to stop at another, nearer island to get further directions anyway. Edit: I wrote most of the rest of this answer before I noticed the comment about "no radio ... tech level similar to the 1500s." That comment makes most of the rest of my originally-written answer obsolete, but I'm leaving it for reference, underneath the separator line below. To have reference directions that one can give directions relative to, the way a captain in the 1500s could give directions relative to the compass card, would require more effort to keep track of the necessary reference directions than I think could be supported by the technology. You'd need either a very stable gyroscopic system or a lot of computing power to figure out what direction was what based on what you could see (and on how much what you saw was likely to have moved since it was last "charted"). So at that level of technology, as far as directions for navigation go, I think "go to that island you see there" is it. Directions to manuever a vessel could still be given by angle of yaw and angle of pitch (having already assigned yaw, pitch, and roll axes to the vessel), but those would be directions relative to whichever way the vessel happened to be oriented when the directions were given.
