Bro. You're overthinking this. Let's say that you're looking for a web development position that involves databases (MySql, SQL Server, Oracle). No one assumes that you've spent 365 contiguous days writing queries to qualify "1 Year" on a questionnaire, because that's not a general expectation in a web development position. If you've used Technology XYZ intermittently between 2011 and 2017, it's just fine to say, "6 Years". If you need to qualify it later, do that. But don't rack your brain with all that stuff you put in your post, because no one (seriously!) is going to do an full-scale audit to make you prove it. Your obligation is that if anyone asks, you need to be able to speak credibly on the experience that you have. It may be enough, and it may not. Lighten up. 

There is a reason why people are issued offices, and it's not just for the ego boost. Partly it's so conversations (personal and on the phone) can be private, but also typically we might have confidential documents such as performance reviews and such like around when we're not. I would say lock the door and have a slot installed for papers, if you think that's necessary. Management should be on your side on this. 

I understand that you are upset that a co-worker buggered up and lied to implicate you (apparently getting away with it), but if there is no proof I would not expect for the company to necessarily do anything visible to you. The fact you felt they believed you and you did not receive a reprimand yourself is an indication. In the other cases you mention involving minorities (and the majority of the work force) there may have been no doubt about where responsibility was, or the worker was honest and owned up to it, so reprimands were easy to dispense. You might want to ask your manager privately and verbally about the situation, if you are on good terms. They may be building a case to dismiss the person for all you know. Going to a hotline or HR and crying discrimination is really a nuclear option. You can be pretty sure they have written documentation to cover each of the reprimands - you could easily be on thin ice in trying to prove a negative. 

You asked if the ports were "important". You did NOT ask, directly, if they should be closed at the present time. Asking if something is "important" may at times be soliciting a subjective answer, and not an objective answer. I think you should just respond with: 

A PM's job is to turn over tasks to you, and report status up the chain. YOUR job, with the PM, is to: 

Here's a link to the actual text of our Labor Code, section 203 . If you are entitled by this or some similar law in your state, you have no duty to whatsoever to go fixing anything for your former employer as a condition to get paid. Your employer can't make up additional rules. If they didn't check on this stuff before you left, too bad. Simply put, it's not your emergency to handle any more. Additionally, the law here specifies penalties for employers who don't want to behave. 

If your employment contract does not prohibit it, then it comes down to the laws in your jurisdiction, local culture and any other restrictions. For example, licensed professionals may be required to adhere to a code of ethics that prohibits such 'moonlighting' activities without written knowledge of all parties, even if their personal ethical standards and laws applicable to the general workforce would permit it. 

To establish a contractual relationship, you should formally acknowledge the purchase order (and therefore acceptance of their terms and conditions). It costs nothing to be polite when doing it. Without the acceptance they're actually left hanging as to whether you're really engaged, because usually the P.O. imposes additional conditions that were not present in your quote, so it's really another offer, not the acceptance of an offer. Typically you will find a lot of boiler plate text on a purchase order that is (not surprisingly) entirely in the favor of the purchaser-- it's worth reading it and seeing just what you are agreeing to. At some point you might want to have a lawyer draft up a pro forma contract that cancels out the most egregious of that B.S. If you're in a field where large amounts of value are being handled, or safety could be an issue, you need to do that first. 

First, if you worked 53 hours, you need to bill for 53. The client is getting the value of 10 extra hours, and you're giving it away for nothing? Don't do that any more. Second, "budget problems" is a negotiating tactic in this situation. The value of your work hasn't decreased a bit. You can't call your phone company, electric company, or landlord and offer half the regular rate for reasons of "budget problems", so why would you accept that from your client? If they need you, they pay your price, or find someone else. Stand your ground - and start looking elsewhere. They're playing a game with you to see if you'll bend, and if you bend once, they'll know that you can be bent again in the future. 

I feel like there is no written rule for this. You want to give them something that will help them later on, so I think the first thing to do is to be sure they want to take it. If the interview is going well, and you feel like the interviewee is feeling relaxed and/or confident, you may evoke his grammatical mistakes. Judging by my own situation (not a native english speaker), I'd gladly accept to have my resume looked up and corrected by a native speaker. On the other hand, if you feel like the candidate is getting crushed during the interview, he's going to have other things on his mind, and at best it'll just elude him. In any case, I'd refrain from starting the interview with such feedback. If I were to receive such feedback, I'd rather receive it at the end of the interview, probably after the questions window, like a casual tip rather than something that could be interpreted as criticism, but before the end as I could want to discuss this feedback. 

This being <'current year'>, I would suggest sending a Linkedin invitation to your new CEO, and mentioning in the invitation that you are looking forward to meeting them. I would not suggest otherwise approaching him or her personally before arriving on their doorstep. By the way, if you are the paranoid sort, there is always a small chance that the CEO is unaware that you were hired, did not approve it, and she or he will cancel your appointment. Less likely when your presence is a fait accompli. Sounds silly, but I've seen this (and rather worse) in startups. 

I've had to deal with this. One measure I've had to use is to make sure that whatever the 'homework' is, it has to be something generic. If it's specific enough for the company to actually benefit from (as in -- take your work and make a buck from it without hiring you), that's a red flag. There'd be nothing wrong with sharing your proximate approach to dealing with a challenge they present to do. But when it comes down to nuts-and-bolts details, remember that the whole reason that you showed up in the first place is so that you can get paid for your expertise. The tact some companies take would be like you taking your car into the local mechanic and having them do an exam before you agree to pay for them to fix the car. It's stupid. 

You'll have to figure out what you can live with and tell them that you need that. You told them the range was okay, apparently it isn't, and you should rectify that reasonably soon. Waiting for an offer and asking for significantly more money might be a negotiating strategy but it might also piss them off royally, and chances are they don't have the ability to offer much more. Don't be overly surprised if this is a deal breaker, but you've lost nothing if you couldn't live with what they can pay. 

This is kind of absurd, at least to me. If you were a bartender at a strip club, this would make perfect sense, as the customers are actually there sometimes for the thrill of throwing dollars. But you work in a liquor store. You get a bottle off the shelf, place it in a bag with customers' other goodies, ring up the sale, and send them on. Maybe you give advice on where to find something, or what tastes good. This isn't tipworthy. It's customer service, and you're being paid for that already. You're new on the job, and trying to force your hand into customers' pockets for a little change. But you'll end up costing your boss, or the owner. There will be a need to carry more small bills from the bank, or go more frequently - that will likely incur a fee, and I'm pretty sure you're not the person who has to deal with or use your time to go to the bank and stand in line. Repeat customers WILL notice, and your approach will annoy them. Let a few of these people mention your behavior to your boss, and you'll quickly be on the hook to justify it.
