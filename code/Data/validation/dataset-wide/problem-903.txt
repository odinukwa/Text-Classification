A Roadside Stand describes a small-time farmer trying to sell their produce from a stall by a busy road. The farmer is poor, wanting only a small slice of city wealth, and feels bitter that drivers won't even look at the stand, let alone stop and buy something. In this context the "trusting sorrow" is a neat encapsulation to express what is described over following few lines: that modern life offers an unspoken promise, which is not being kept. 

It appears there may be a misunderstanding in the question. There is no particular significance to Atrocities The Wikipedia quote is a bad summary of the article it references, which makes two separate points run together. The article opens with the changes to the poem Atrocities, a choice made by the journalist for a number of reasons. The poem is fairly well known. It has shocking, evocative imagery. And the draft version makes clear that the changes are substantial, with the original being even more provocative. All of these things make it a great lede for a newspaper article. The quote about the "treasure trove" in the article is much further down. Set in context it is clear that the person who said this, Sassoon's biographer Jean Wilson, is referring to the entire collection, not just a single poem. 

The answer to this question lies in the genesis of the book. Grahame invented these characters in stories told to his son, who suffered a variety of health problems and eventually committed suicide. It is likely that Toad's failings, which form the backbone of the narrative, were intended as a form of moral fable. However, neither Grahame nor his publisher originally intended the book to be specifically for children. The author pitched it as ... 

It's also noteworthy that at all three harpooners on the ship are non-Christian "savages". The rescue of Tashtego is not so much a birth as a "rebirth", and as such mirrors a resurrection from the dead, a miracle performed only by Christ. This passage shows that Christians are not the only progenitors of such miracles. Instead, concern for our fellow man allows any of us to perform the miracle of rebirth in rescuing some poor unfortunate in distress. Parts of this answer reference the paper 'Hunting and Writing the Whale: Masculine Responses to the Maternal in Herman Melville' by Seth A. Hagen 

No. Nothing else has ever been officially published regarding the sequel. Yes. In a 2007 interview with Pictures Magazine, Goldman says he would love to write a sequel, but has been unable to do so to his satisfaction: 

Furthermore there is Blodeuwedd herself, whose fury powers the entire plot of the book and cannot ever seem to be satisfied, in spite of the implied deaths of many men down the centuries. Does the lack of any positive female role models make the book sexist? If not, why not? 

In which Crow is examining the grass, the stone and the dead mole, seeking to understand them by a fixed process. In the first instance this process is tuition, the second observation and the third experimentation - the processes we gradually teach to children as ways of furthering an understanding of the natural world. But to Crow, they are not insightful. In this context we can understand the couplet 

It is worth noting that this reference to T. S. Eliot in Catch-22 is not isolated. Over the following two pages, it is repeated eleven times. Heller wants us to remember the name. Eliot has been both praised and criticised for the obscure, ambiguous nature of his poetry. His contribution to literary criticism reflects this, arguing that any art can only be understood in context of previous art and that while poems may have a stated meaning, non-subjective judgments by readers are equally valid. In the book, the colonels treat the name as though it is some sort of puzzle, which would seem to be a fitting metaphor for the way in which critics (and Eliot himself), treated Eliot's poetry. 

... is slightly odd, and at first, glance makes it sound as though the man is watching the canvas unrolling. But it's only some confusion around the tense. You can also read it as meaning "he saw the canvas, which was already unrolled" or that "he saw the canvas, which someone was in the process of unrolling". The canvas is being unrolled, presumably, so that the grave can be filled. 

Which would seem to imply that he thought of it as a kind of Young Adult book for his age, aimed at late teens and adults who wished to keep that flame alive. The sheer density of the language supports that view: my pre-teen children, both prolific readers, struggled with the book. The original publisher advertised the book as: 

Kant contributed strongly to the field of Metaphysics, the branch of philosophy that deals with abstract thought. His connection with the title of the story is obvious. "Keck" for "Kant" seems a linguistic stretch, but there is evidence this is correct. First, your original Quora source suggests that "Keck" is a valid Chinese name, so it may be that MacDonald was attempting to keep it as authentic sounding as possible: 

The metaphor is wider than Ishmael allows in the book. Birth, at the time the novel was written, was a dangerous business. The passage in question makes clear that this birth is equally dangerous to the participants. Both Tashtego and Queequeg almost drown and the valuable head is lost in the depths of the sea. The crew of the ship is all-male yet the metaphor of birth here is clearly feminine and it seems to fascinate the whalemen. This is not the only time that birth is used as a metaphor in Moby-Dick. A more horrific "masculine" birth is used several times to describe how the male imagination has "birthed" Moby-Dick itself. 

None of which suggests a piece of work aimed at younger readers, in spite of the anthropomorphic nature of the characters. So: Grahame originally invented some children's stories for his son. According to his wife, Elspeth, he then wrote these down as individual short stories. Later, he went back to them and composed the stories into a single narrative which he intended for young adults and it was at this point that he inserted the two chapters to which you refer: Piper at the Gates of Dawn and Wayfarers All. It seems likely, although I have no evidence for this, that he intended them to increase the literary weight of the finished work. The answer to your question then, is that they stick out from the general narrative because they were, in fact, later additions. And that they differ in tone because they are there to serve a different purpose. References: 

There are a number of reasons why Ishmael might be considered unreliable, although none of them is conclusive. In most cases, there is an alternative explanation for Ishmael's seeming duplicity. It starts, of course, with the famous opening "Call me Ishmael" which can be read in the context of an assumed name. I won't pursue this further as you have an independent question on this. The opening then goes on to cast Ishmael as a troubled individual, as indeed he might be given his story.
