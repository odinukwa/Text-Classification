Instead of thinking in terms of sets and reps, think instead in terms of groups of exercises and the manner in which you perform them. The weight room is there for both general physical preparedness, and to build more strength. The goal is to build both plain physical strength and explosive strength. The most important principle is Compensatory Acceleration Training (CAT). The idea is to accelerate all the way through the lift as if it were your max effort. It is always performed with submaximal weights that feel heavy, but you have no doubt about hitting 5x5. For further reading, look at Donche, Dan (2008). FF Trainer Certification Guide. USA: Fatal Fitness. Your training should at least include the following: 

It's good that you do deadlifts, but the next best size builder are straight up free weight squats. Please do not be overconfident the first time you do free weight squats to full depth. Get used to the movement with an empty bar and the work up to it. I was able to do machine squats at over 400lbs, but when it came to free weight squats I couldn't even do half that. There is such a difference in the range of motion, that you'll find yourself much weaker where the machines couldn't hit. When you have maxed out the weight you can do with a machine, the only thing you can do with it is increase the overall volume. More reps, more sets. But that's it. The four big compound lifts are also major mass builders: 

These are very demanding, and should be followed by a nice slow walk for active recovery. 1-2 mile walk keeping your heart rate in the active recovery zone (typically somewhere around 100-110 BPM but varies by individual). Moderate caloric deficit The caloric deficit should be enough to lose about 1 pound per week, any more than that and you are looking further down the list. This should get you from about 20% to 15% body fat. You can still build strength, but you will be working against a bit of a headwind. At this range we'll be combining weighted endurance work and active recovery. 

The bottom line is that the smaller muscles used in isolation movements are only going to get so strong on their own. In order for your mind and body to agree on heavier weight, the mind has to be assured that the rest of the body can handle it. It's one reason that deadlifts are limited by what you can grip. The mind puts the breaks on if it thinks you can't hold the bar, and this is an involuntary reflex. Since compound movements take care of multiple groups of muscles, when you go back in for isolation work you will be able to do that at higher weights. The alternative approach also works. It's similar to how Hepburn routines splits things up. Essentially for a few months you are working on strength primarily, and when you can't make any more progress that way you switch to hypertrophy for a few months. And alternate. I personally prefer to do the strength and hypertrophy work in the same session. Both are needed to get stronger (my goals), and it's just a matter of adjusting the proportion of work that goes into what I want to emphasize at any given time. 

The bottom line is that as you mature as a lifter, you'll pick your squat based on what you are trying to emphasize at the time. And some people are just fine doing nothing but one kind of squat and get stronger. There are no hard and fast rules, only guidelines. I personally use more variation when I'm in my off season, favoring the variations that are harder for me to perform. As I get within 2-3 months of a competition, I focus primarily on the events in that competition. 

These are going to be your best defenses, but they are not magic formulas. Supplementing with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) doesn't make you immune to rhabdo, it simply helps your body recover from fatigue better. The most important thing you can do is when your muscles are fatigued to the point where standing or walking is laborious your need to stop exercising and go into recovery mode. It also might be a good chance to evaluate your training environment. Working with others can be a tremendous motivator, but if no-one is going to call you on over-working and instead coerce you to "push through the pain" then that training environment might actually be toxic for you. It's best to be surrounded with people who work hard, but recognize the importance of recovery. 

I take it your goal is similar to what mine was when I started lifting weights: get stronger and lose fat. In fact, I'm still working on that process now and making decent headway. In order to pull off this feat, do the lifting program as laid out. Both Starting Strength and Strong Lifts are good beginner programs--particularly for guys in their 20s. It's still doable if you are older, you just might have to switch programs sooner than a younger guy. The other part is to eat to lose weight. A few short tips: 

Many times that tiredness you feel in the afternoon is more related to what you eat more than anything else. In studying for music recording, one of the instructors made the comment that if you want to kill a recording session quickly order pizza for lunch. He then went on to suggest deli sandwiches as a better alternative. Now, we can all agree that a music recording instructor is not a nutritionist. However, that observation is based on experience. Bottom line: heavy, greasy foods that cause your digestion system to work hard are going to sap your energy in the afternoon. Your body is moving its most precious resource (blood) to the stomach and digestive tract to process all that heavy food. Something that is lighter in the middle of the day, but still filling is much better. A deli sandwich has protein in the meats and cheese on the sandwich, yet without being too heavy (unless it is monster sized). It gives you the energy to go a few more hours and that's all you want out of lunch anyway. Now, if you do choose to get your blood pumping to boost your alertness in the afternoon, you still don't want a heavy greasy meal. Actually, you will do quite well if your lunch meal has: 

Just keep in mind that you are still growing, and the years 15-17 are when most boys grow the fastest. You'll probably grow faster than the increase pace I recommended. Don't freak out, just try to keep yourself in a healthy body fat range and enjoy process. Just jumping into 5,000 calories a day will likely make you fat. The people who need that kind of food worked up to that level over years of training. Crazy Weights I do recommend doing some training in the weight room. Again, I recommend slow and steady improvements. That said, don't let a number on the bar scare you. At one of my power lifting competitions, a 14 year old boy deadlifted over 315 lbs. Check your resources I invite you to verify my recommendations with other resources. I've found Juggernaut Training Systems and Strengtheory to be very good resources by people I respect. Much of what I am recommending I summarized from several articles from both of those sites.
