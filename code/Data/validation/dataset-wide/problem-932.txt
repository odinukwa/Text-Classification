The hydrostatic approximation begins with the full 3-D momentum equation (Navier-Stokes) and through scale analysis the vertical momentum equation reduces to: $$\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial z} = -\rho g$$ This is a balance between the vertical pressure gradient force and gravity with no net acceleration. This tends to hold for atmospheric phenomena that are much wider than they are tall. On the synoptic scale where vertical motions are on the order of 1 cm s$^{-1}$ this holds, but in a thunderstorm where updrafts can attain speeds of 100 m s$^{-1}$ this approximation doesn't work. A hydrostatic model uses the hydrostatic approximation in place of an equation for $w$, while a non-hydrostatic model uses the momentum equation for $w$. As the ECMWF page you link to suggests, models with low grid resolution can get by with the hydrostatic approximation. A model with dx=dy=10 km means the grid volume is 100 km$^{2}$ times whatever the vertical grid spacing is. The $w$ value for that grid box needs to be representative of the entire volume and you aren't going to explicitly resolve convection at this resolution (convection will be parameterized and in general a model can only resolve features that are about 4x bigger than the grid spacing). As you reduce grid spacing (increase resolution) and start to resolve non-hydrostatic features (thunderstorm updrafts, downdrafts, etc), then you need to make sure you are using a non-hydrostatic solver. For high resolution operational regional modeling and research modeling in the mesoscale using WRF-NMM, WRF-ARW, CM1, ARPS you'll find non-hydrostatic solvers. The non-hydrostatic solver is more computationally expensive than a hydrostatic solver, and is often found in higher resolution models which themselves are more computationally expensive than coarse grids. 

To supplement farrenthorpe's answer, the color of the sky will be a function of the path length between the top of atmosphere and your eye along the path from the sun to you. Due to Rayleigh scattering, shorter wavelengths will scatter before longer ones. As the path length increases more of the longer wavelengths will be scattered. The color of the sky is the sum of all of the photons scattered out of the beam of photons from the sun and then re-scattered so they end up hitting your eye. Our blue sky is a result of the depth of the atmosphere (small). If the atmosphere was less deep (shorter path length) the sky would tend toward darker blue/violet. If the atmosphere was deeper (longer path length) the sky would tend toward oranges, pinks and reds. We see the latter case during sunset. Given observations taken at solar noon at latitudes between the 66 N/S there likely is some variance in sky color as there will be subtle path length differences at different latitudes, particularly between the hemispheres due to the earths tilt. However, you would likely need a sensitive instrument to notice these differences and could consider it a constant. The variance in sky color during the diurnal cycle from dawn till dusk is a far stronger effect than looking only at solar noon day-to-day. Note that I am only considering scattering by a uniform atmosphere neglecting the effects of aerosols and water vapor. Foris's answer takes up this topic (and you can easily observe the difference in how the sky looks on a very dry day vs a very humid day). 

The term "partly cloudy", for example, varies in interpretation but is generally around 0.3 or 0.4 to 0.6 or 0.7 cloud cover (where 0.0 is clear sky and 1.0 is overcast). The type of cloud will also vary the light transmitted. A high cirrus or altocirrus cloud layer will transmit light to the surface, whereas a low stratocumulus overcast will only transmit a small fraction of light (note how grey and dreary a northern winter day can be under those clouds). The fraction of light transmitted will depend on the depth of the cloud layer. The light transmitted will also be a function of time of day and day of the year, both of which determine the position of the sun. For a look into how these issues play out in a real experiment, take a look at Pfister et. al. (2003) who look at how cloud fraction and irradiance are related over New Zealand. I think you'll find most of the literature deals with solar irradiance, so it may help you in searches to look for that term rather than illuminance.

The physical parameters you need to measure to confirm the existence of the greenhouse effect are few and simple. Measure the electromagnetic properties of constituent molecules in the atmosphere. Specifically, look at absorption cross sections as a function of wavelength for solar and terrestrial emission bands. Some molecules will be transparent at solar and terrestrial bands and some will be transparent in some bands and opaque in others. If you can find molecules that are transparent to shortwave but opaque in longwave the you have a molecule that lets energy into the atmosphere but prevents some portion of energy from escaping. This energy that is absorbed causes local heating. This local heating is the green house effect. 

This means you need to provide the RH proportion, not the percentage. E.g. divide by 100 -- RH=1 for 100%, RH=0.5 for 50%, etc. If you adjust your input data you should be able to use your code as-is. If you wish to compare it to something, you can reference the solution below. 

It is a common misconception that Coriolis is responsible for the direction the water swirls down a toilet, tub or sink drain. E.g. does a toilet flush the other way in the southern hemisphere? (If it does, it is due to the construction of the basin, not Coriolis). This misconception has been debunked many times and leads to a new issue I ran into recently. I was talking to someone about low pressure systems (cyclones, e.g. mid-latitude storms and tropical cyclones) spinning in the opposite sense in the the north and south hemispheres and they questioned this fact because "Coriolis does not determine how something spins, Mythbusters showed that with a toilet". This demonstrates a lack of understanding in how Coriolis works and leads to this question: Why does Coriolis determine the sense of rotation of a cyclone but not my drain? How can it work on one phenomenon but not the other? 

The reason is that we need them! And we could probably do with more of them (e.g. bigger launch budgets). Surface observations will tell us where fronts are, where low and high pressure is, and how surface temperature and moisture are being advected. We can also deduce large scale ascent or descent (vertical motion) from surface divergence and convergence. We might even be able to provide very short term forecasting, though the skill won't be great. To know how the surface will evolve you need to know what is going on above the surface. If we know what the 500 mb surface looks like, we can combined this information with the surface fields and some quasi-geostrophic theory and do better with short term forecasts. With just one upper air layer we can see how the feedbacks between the mid/upper-troposphere and the surface will behave and better predict the development and motion of low pressure systems. To provide more accurate forecasts, have a shot at predicting convection, and provide longer term forecasts we need more information about the vertical structure of the atmosphere. The current state of models are such that one of the best things we can do to improve them are to provide better initial conditions (better observations and more of them). Balloon launches are a great way of getting this data. Ground and satellite based observations can provide parts of this, but we still benefit from being able to directly sample the atmosphere and to calibrate the remote sensing algorithms with the radiosondes. One example of the necessity of balloon launches is in convection. Knowing only surface convergence, temperature and moisture is important, but does not tell the whole story. If the 850 mb temperatures are too warm, it won't matter how good the surface observations look, you won't get convection. How much energy the storm can tap into depends on the temperatures all the way up to the tropopause (and higher if you want to know how high the cloud tops will be). Knowing what type of storm to expect depends on knowing the winds in at least the bottom 6 km of the atmosphere. Having vertical information provided by a radiosonde is the difference in only being able to say "the air is warm and juicy" versus being able to say "expect isolated supercells today with large hail and straight-line wind damage" or "despite the high dew points, the capping inversion and associated CIN will suppress all convection today -- no storms" given the exact same surface observations. And yes, models can give us the upper air structure to base these kind of statements on, but remember the radiosonde launches are where a lot of the upper-air data comes from that allows the models to work well comes from. 

Because the atmosphere is giving a nice case study, here is an example of a sounding that demonstrates the above concepts. This is from a radiosonde launched at Jackson, MS this morning at 12Z. 

The reported pressures are sea level pressure. For stations not at sea level (most of them), they can be corrected to sea level through use of the hypsometric equation. The reason the values are reported as sea level pressure is so that pressure values between stations can be interpreted in meaningful ways. See for example a typical sea level pressure plot: 

Water vapor contributes to humidity but water vapor does not include liquid water. Cloud water, ice, snow, rain, grapple, hail all contribute to the total mass of a volume of air, but are not humidity. 

Another flow is the isallobaric wind, and this is wind that blows from pressure rises toward pressure falls. A place you will normally see this wind is just as a cold front passes and the pressure rises behind the front and falls in front of it. This enhances the cross frontal wind and helps produce the often strong, gusty winds after a cold front passes. 

Dropsonde missions over the continental US are problematic. The mesoscale predictability experiment (MPEX) use dropsondes to determine if better upper air observations could improve predictability in the mesoscale. One big issue they had is restrictions in where they could drop from the FAA. They had to provide notice well in advance of the flights and could only conduct missions during certain time windows. This provided big restrictions in dropsonde missions and would probably make it unsuitable for drops into deep convection (though one might argue with air traffic routing around such convection, that would make drops feasible from an FAA standpoint). There were some recent talks about MPEX at the 27th Conference on Severe Local Storms in a session about MPEX. In particular, a talk by Morris Weisman (video) talks a bit about the dropsonde missions.

I wouldn't characterize the movement of the jetstream as a "less well known" problem, at least not to anyone who has sat through a synoptic meteorology class. The jetstream from a dynamic point of view is just an enhanced gradient in the heights on a constant pressure surface (or pressures on a constant height surface) and there are many factors the influence this gradient. First, lets take a look at the northern hemisphere 500 mb heights and surface pressure: 

It seems that you are wondering how a chemical that prevents heat (putting out a fire) can also cause heating (global warming). These two things happen through unrelated processes. Fire extinguishers that use CO2 act by displacing oxygen. The CO2 doesn't directly interact with the fire but just takes up space so that oxygen cannot interact with the fire. There is a secondary effect that the CO2 exiting the extinguisher is cooler than the air it is displacing so it helps to remove heat from the fire (by putting it somewhere else). These are reasons that CO2 extinguishers are not suitable for all kinds of fire suppression, particular for fires that have oxidizers and do not rely on atmospheric oxygen for combustion. The contribution to global warming from CO2 (and all other greenhouse gases) is a radiative effect. Every molecule has specific frequencies of electromagnetic radiation they absorb and emit. The earth (and all things) emit electromagnetic radiation based upon its surface temperature. This energy would be lost to space (cooling the earth) except that the greenhouse gases absorb radiation at the same wavelengths the earth emits at. This means that, e.g. CO2, intercepts this energy headed for space and instead absorbs it, causing the CO2 to warm up a little. This CO2 also emits radiation but will emit less than it absorbs (and some of its emission is back toward the earth, not space), so there is a net energy gain due to atmospheric GHG, which causes warming. As you can see, the mechanisms that CO2 contributes to global warming and fire suppression are unrelated (radiative vs displacement) which is why this molecule can be used in these seemingly contradictory applications. 

For an example of how bad agricultural practices can cause soil loss and end up with dust and sand, see the conditions that preceded the dust bowl in the USA. Certain crops are bad for soil and if not rotated will eventually deplete the soil of nutrients leading to no crops. With nothing holding the soil in place (roots) it will erode. The Sahara has other ill effects going on, such as synoptic scale atmospheric descent (interaction from the Walker Circulation and the Hadley cell) which promotes dry, warm conditions. I'm not sure that rainfall will vary based on soil health, but one avenue to look into is soil moisture and other sources of water. Rain begins as water vapor and that water vapor comes from evaporation (from bodies of water, entrainment), evapotranspiration (from soil and plants) and advection (blown in with the wind). If the predominant flow does not bring in moisture and you lose the ability to hold water in the soil, this could conceivably locally reduce water vapor mixing ratios and impact precipitation. That is just a guess and it would be worth searching the literature (you can freely download AMS articles older than 2 years old and search them here). 

If you consider a closed system, this will be true, as dewpoint is related to the absolute moisture which is not a function of temperature. However, as Fred's answer demonstrates, the atmosphere is not a closed system. Even devoid of fronts and severe weather there are still pressure gradients which result in wind. Wind advects moisture and so if there is wind the moisture (dew point) can change. Furthermore if we consider surface fluxes that statement becomes even less true. With no advection if we have vegetation or standing water on the surface we can increase the dew point just through evapotranspiration.
