Your problem isn't food delivery. Food delievery is easy. You simply pay people to deliver food. Nobody inspects food transfers strongly enough that a truck driving food around get's strongly monitored. As long as the driver is on the paycheck of the secred society there's no problem. On the other hand you forget the problem of building an underground basis in which 100 people can live in the first place. That's going to take heavy building machinery and a lot of workers. It's going to get noticed by the local government and the local government is going to want building permits. That's why actual secret societies like the Mafia or groups like P2 don't have underground bases hidden 5000 meters under ground. That's why other mechanisms for secrecy get used in real life. 

Information stored on the internet still exists if you destroy the internet because most a lot of important information has backups. Even an EMP wouldn't make the knowledge of Wikipedia to be lost. If you however just want the internet to breakdown make a party attack intercontinental cables. If those get destroyed the global internet as we know it breaks down. 

Different human civilisations used different bases. The Bablonians used base 60 the Maya base 20. $URL$ shows how many possible bases are used by different languages. Even within our own language we don't only use base ten. On side of a clock shows 12 hours. There are 2*12=24 hours per day and not 10 or 100 hours. There are 12*5=60 minutes per hour. Having 60 minutes per hour means that it's 1/3 of an hour is a nice round number of 20 minutes. If the hour had 100 minutes 33.333 minutes wouldn't be a nice round number. Rumours have it some tribes in America still uses a system of measuring lengths that uses base 12. In Europe the French tried to get everything normed to base 10 and the common base is useful but even the French didn't succeed in getting the 10 day week. They tried but people liked their 7 day week too much to switch. 

It's possible to fly without power. In 2008 there was a talk at the Chaos Computer Congress titled Flying for free - Exploiting the weather with unpowered aircraft. With enough information about the weather they manage to travel 3,000km without any power. 

You could say that magic needs a certain state of mind to work. It's practitioners could have to rely very much on intuition. That state of mind could be incompatible with doing scientific investigation. 

A cloud computing company could evolve into such a nation. Within cloud-nation different companies could have API that can only accessed from within the cloud-nation. The cloud nation could add conflict arbitration to their roles. 

The key issue is whether ethics should be based on consent or whether you believe in utilitarian where only the effects of your actions matter and consent doesn't. If you look at other debates in the US where consent is a big deal, there's sex. Feminists push for "Yes means Yes" consent laws. To the extend that you believe in "Yes means Yes" as a general principle it makes sense to oppose organ harvesting without expressed consent. On the other end of the spectrum you have religious people who care about the sanctity of life. It's possible for a church leader to declare that death as the Bible means the term means that a person can't be reanimated in principle by human intervention and doesn't just mean that the EEG goes to zero. Practically it's also worth noting that the choice isn't really anymore between opt-out and opt-in. The modern policy is forced choice if you want certain government benefits like getting a drivers license. Forced choice is how Alaska has it's 80% opt-in rate. Given Christians who oppose stem cell research as immoral it's not that hard to make the against the current way organ donation is done. If a Democratic president would push for organ-donation without explicit consent there a good chance that the resulting rate of people signed up for organ donation is less than it would be with forced choice. The debate has the danger to raise ghosts that everyone who cares for organ donations would rather have sleeping. A/B testing to optimize sign up rate at forced choice documents is a policy that makes much more sense than organ donation without explicit consent if someone would want to increase the number of available organs. 

Basic income is the idea that the sum is payed to every citizen whether or not they have a job. As a result any additional income that the person makes helps them. A low basic income makes it easier for citizens to take low paying jobs because they don't lose any of the government support the moment they take a job. Otherwise I don't think that German society would change that much if the job center would stop to pressure people to seek jobs and simply transfers Hartz IV money without asking about the amount of tried job applications. It likely would need to be a higher amount of money to discourage people from low status jobs. 

In our world you can look at how our society treats hypnosis. There were open heart surgeries performed without anesthetics under Dave Elman. There aren't any scientific publications of using hypnosis for that use case. There are a few scientific publications that suggest that supplementing classic anesthisia with hypnosis generally improves health outcomes. Doing hypnosis well often coindides with a state of mind that very different from the mind of a scientist. That's because it's important to be in certain states of mind when doing hypnosis. A hypnotist is more effective if he strongly believes in the suggestion that he gives. Why have a doctrine according to which clinical effects created by suggestions aren't supposed to count because they are placebo. Hypnosis genereally works through creating clinical effects through suggestion. I know multiple people who got their wisdom teeth drawn without anesthesia and without any pain. Yet that's not the topic of scientific attention. Using hypnosis to reduce pain is a topic that's openly discussed. Dave Elman didn't try to keep his knowledge secret from science. There are other communities that do try to keep what they are doing secred. In Tantra that happens a lot. MIT trained computer scientist Dave Chapman has an interesting article about the Windhorse technique where he speaks about it but doesn't reveal what it's about because he promised to keep it secred. Secrecy is the anti-thesis to our system of science. In a world with working magic it would be easily imagineable that magicians can cast binding oathes of secrecy about not telling non-magicians about the way magic works. At the moment a magician violates the oath of secrecy he dies. A complex system of binding oathes might also reduce the number of magicians that exist because magicians regularly die for violating some oath they swore. When they get into a situation where two different oathes they swore require them to engage in different actions they die.
