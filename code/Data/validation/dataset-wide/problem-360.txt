Crack down on the small players, the tougher it is to be one of the small players the more they'll unite to become big players. The big players will then crack down on the small players themselves. After that all you need to do is formalise the bribery into a system of taxes and you're all set for officially sanctioned organised crime. Vetinari would be proud As for the tourists: A simple fee payable in your hotel will guarantee immunity from all petty crime for the duration of your visit. Call it ... insurance, just remember to carry your receipt with you, you may need to show it. 

One man in one little ship? I'm afraid it's not going to work out. The size and resources of empires at war mean that there'll just be too many places he needs to be and no way of knowing where they are. The lone hero is not realistic in imperial combat. 

Theoretically yes, in practice no You don't actually need a sealed balloon of helium for uncontrolled lighter than air flight. You can just fill a plastic bag and watch it float away. Why do we seal the bag? Two primary reasons, first to stop the helium escaping and secondly to give us some control over the lift by reducing the lift volume without dumping gas. Your canopy in the helium layer will be displacing air in the oxygen layer for lift, that much is fine, but if anything displaces the helium from your canopy, how are you getting it back again? In fact, how did you get up there in the first place? 

Horizon effects would be the first signal. As a quick and dirty calculation, the distance to the horizon in miles is half your height in feet. Given their visual range is going to be far greater than that, you have two options, either the world is absolutely vast (even though gravity is Earth normal) or it's flat. They'll quickly realise something strange is going on, after that it's a matter of working out what. Spread out, do some triangulation and they'll find the answer. Then the sunset will be all wrong. 

You could take a relatively simple approach to this and say that materials that are themselves increasingly invariant with time are increasingly resistant to temporal manipulation. As examples, paper is particularly fleeting in its existence and would pose no resistance at all. Things like bricks, recently made and soon to decay would also be barely a shadow, But gold or granite, materials that stand invariable through the ages would be largely impenetrable to him. (It also gives you a reason for golden armour, but that's by the by.) By your question you're looking for a particular unobtanium grade of time resistance that I'm going to call eternium. Gold tarnishes, granite erodes but eternium is unchanging, unreactive and incredibly hard to work with. 

Time is against you The nearest red giant to Earth is 37 light years away, so the signal he has is at least 37 years late but more likely about 10,000 years late. His signal to them has much the same problem. Your scientist is looking for the dips in light from specific stars, the light from those stars takes 1 year to reach him for each light year it is distant from him. Hence the use of light years as a measure of distance. Considering him to be on Earth, the nearest red giant is 37LY away, so 37 years before the dip in light from that star reaches us. Given that the Milky Way is around 100,000LY across, even if the passing fleet is relatively close to Earth, only 10% of the galaxy away, the fleet would have passed 10,000 years before the scientist would be in a position to notice that it had done so. Assuming that any species capable of intergalactic travel won't be moving STL between stops: 

The Custom of the Sea applies Though in your case it's the custom of the ice. The custom of the sea allows the survivors to agree to resort to cannibalism to survive a shipwreck without the usual penalties associated with killing (and eating) someone on return to civilisation. First you eat those who are dead or dying anyway. Then you draw lots. This drawing of lots is important, it makes it fair on all those involved. It so happened that the passengers tended to lose first, followed by the junior crew, but lots were drawn. Your society is drawing the lots in advance and skipping the stage of eating the already dying. Though you have declared this out of scope it is highly significant that you may be eating the healthiest to try to save those who may die regardless. Eat the fat one A couple of links but we'll go over the key aspects $URL$ 

Unlikely You're not generating clouds like this, you're generating (salty) rain directly. Look at the Angel Falls for the effect you're going to get. At the top it's a waterfall, but by the time the water is about 2/3 of the way down it's effectively falling as rain. You're going to have much the same effect over a much larger area, the rain will constantly fall, with a permanent rainbow in daylight, but you're unlikely to see clouds. 

A language where much of the meaning is dependent on other factors, the time of day, the relative status of the speakers, the (relative) sexes of the speakers. In current languages there are many examples of situation dependent words Consider the Polish "kurwa" which in many ways is even more versatile than the potential English usage of "fuck"*, it's equally possible to use it, and derivatives thereof, as every word in a sentence and it cannot be translated out of context. You can have examples of words that just don't translate because the second language just doesn't have that concept, German examples being "verschlimmbesserung" and "schadenfreude", the latter of which English just had to take directly. While these words can be explained, you have to stop the flow of conversation to explain a concept rather than give a straight translation. Consider also the double entendre (said the actress to the bishop), which meaning is actually intended, or whether both are. It's up to the listener to identify the intent of the sentence, or potentially miss all that's being said because the meanings are overlaid onto each other. Once translated the duplicitous meanings are often lost. *I'll give you a language warning but it should be taken as read just from the text of the link. 

As you can see from this article, you can in practice put the new year whenever you like. Different calendars still have it in different places, some calendars, like the Jewish calendar, actually have a selection of new years for historic reasons, including one at the start of spring, one in the autumn, and another in approximately late January just for trees. 

"The ability to control fire" and "modern military" are entirely exclusive. The two cannot exist together. What is a modern military if not controlled fire. Fire in the breach, fire in the hole, burning jet fuel, engine fuel. To control fire implies also to suppress fire, fire suppression over an area turns a modern military into a bunch of guys with expensive scrap metal. Guns won't fire, engines won't run, planes fall out of the sky, bombs and missiles won't explode, it's all ultimately fire. Even if you don't allow fire suppression, aircraft that explode with a wave of the hand or the ability to detonate an ammo dump with a thought, equally shuts out any modern military capabilities. 

Consequences schmonsequences This is the dawn of the industrial age, the forests were turned to charcoal and ships. Except it isn't, it came a lot sooner. What magic gives is an easy way through the barriers that require technological advancement. We needed to invent the steam engine, they needed to enchant a rod to spin continuously. We needed to invent the blast furnace to smelt iron, they just needed a fire spell. The weight of an engine and fuel was a significant factor holding back powered long distance heavier than air flight. That's no longer a thing. Enchant a rod to spin, attach a gearbox and propellor and you don't even need to carry fuel. The same is true of iron ships needing vast steam engines, cars, trucks, trains, power stations. None of this requires the technological advancement that we needed. Magic is a bypass on every hard physical limitation on the world. This is why magic is so hard to work with, and the mix of magic and technology is almost impossible. It's very easy to create basic magical items on an industrial scale that could act as the engines for technological marvels and completely throw out the balance of a world.
