Try PS. should be loaded, installed PPS. Trust me, thermal monitoring is one of the lamest things ipmi can do - explore the power of Serial-over-LAN, System-Event-Log, PEF-traps, remote power control, boot device manipulation and KVM-over-LAN! 

Just remember - don't touch if it works. So, unless system hasn't got any vulnerabilities, let it be. If it has - update it to the latest release/patchlevel or update port with recursive rebuilding of dependencies. Of course careful reading of and is a MUST. PS. Tools you'll use are doesn't really matter i think. I prefer: 

Each connection we make requires an ephemeral port, and thus a file descriptor, and by default this is limited to 1024. To avoid the Too many open files problem you’ll need to modify the ulimit for your shell. This can be changed in , but requires a logout/login. For now you can just sudo and modify the current shell (su back to your non-priv’ed user after calling ulimit if you don’t want to run as root): 

OK, classic case of using a set of DNS records that work with one configuration, but not this one. Classic 1 server setting 

However, that doesn't work where the main domain has a different IP address The simple solution is to delete the CNAME and replace it with an A record for learn.numeet.com Just in case someone else find this problem here, the corrected setting was: 

Is there a problem with Route 53 having multiple routes to the server (www.numeet.com via ELB and learn.numeet.com via Elastic IP) ? What am I missing? 

MongoDB 2.0 added the db.fsyncLock() method to lock the database and flush writes to disk and added the db.fsyncUnlock() method to unlock the database after the snapshot has completed. During the time the database is locked, any write requests that this database receives will be rejected. Any application code will need to deal with these errors appropriately. How to set Mongo with EC2 is covered here: $URL$ And the backup is covered here: $URL$ 

And even lower level hardware tunings accessible via . PS. Read kernel the docs, especially Documentation/networking/scaling.txt PPS. While tuning TCP performance you may want to consult with RFC6349 PPPS. D-Link is not the best network hardware. Try Intel hardware with pci-x or pci-64 

I guess that "server's control panel" software can be rewritten to be more efficient and not to degrade performance over time. NB! Do not copy/paste s from production servers - there could be some sensitive information inside that JSON e.g. logins/passwords/session/API-keys/etc. 

Do you need varnish at all? 1. nginx can cache results on disk or in memcached 2. nginx has SSI 3. nginx has fair load balancer or ey-balancer 4. Best practice says that HAProxy before nginx is good move. Don't forget about KISS - more components your system has - less stable it becomes. 

If I install vmware workstation v7 on top of v6.5, will it use the same license key, or do I have to buy a v7 license? 

I know how to configure one IIS instance to run many websites using the same public ip address, but different domain names (As long as I have control over the domains). But how can you configure many IIS servers running on different virtual machines in the same network, to host websites using the same public IP addres, but different domain names? Normailly in IIS under the website you can set the headers to which the website will respond to. but what if that website is on a different machine? Edit: Let me explain better. Pretend that you have only one public IP address that you can use to serve up websites. You want to expose multiple websites under that same IP address, but the websites live on different physical machines, within your network. 

Is your hash ALLCAPS? Maybe you should use 40 characters... It looks like sha1 hash. May be you should simplify regexp to 

Since August 2009 flash 10 works with out problems on FreeBSD. You can use either linux-f10-flashplugin10 with f10 linuxulator or linux-f8-flashplugin10 with f8. After port instalation there is some black magic with nspluginwrapper and symlinks 

What you think is good notebook for sysadmin? May be you can list specific models; What hardware extensions(i.e. USB devices) you think should be added to "sysadmin must-have" list; 

For those of you who still not tired of "XYZ for sysadmin" questions: This subject is bothering me for a long time. I had number of problems selecting notebook for job. For example: 

For EC2, first check your network security groups. Normally outbound is open, but inbound is completely closed. Did you set up port 22 and set it either to your IP address or open? Also, check what happens when you type . No error message is usually good. Do you have more than one instance? Can you ssh from one to the other? Also, make sure you are using the public IP address 

This will force users to https, even if they type http, plus it makes it easy to develop the site offline because you just update the WP_HOME to local host and https is no longer the default 

Frame arrives at NIC's rx descriptor ring. Through DMA it gets transferred to RX ring in RAM. Driver converts device specific descriptors in RX ring to some kind of general network kernel structure (e.g. / or ). Also here packet gets copied to bpf device. In depending on protocol and address families of the frame it gets processed by corresponding (protocol switch) array entry. Then after or / datagram arrives at socket layer to the corresponding routing daemon's (socket receive buffer). From this point routing daemon usually gets notified about pending data on socket via some kind of I/O notification facility (select(2) / poll(2) / epoll(7) / kqueue(2)) and uses recv(3) on that socket to extract packets' payload. Here / / takes it's place. Routing daemon does it's magic and alters kernels' routing table(s) via routing sockets (PF_ROUTE in BSD derivatives or PF_NETLINK's NETLINK_ROUTE in Linux) 

What I would really like to do is, I would like to find a way to be using my Home desktop developing on that, and whenever my computer tries to access servers on the Data Center, I would like to tunnel that traffic through the two VPN tunnels which are currently separating me and the Data Center. I have admin privileges on both Office Desktop and Home Desktop, but I do not have any admin privileges in the Data Center. So what kind of tunneling solution could I use here? Is it even possible? 

I am a web developer, and I find myself often working from home. But when I do, I am forced to Remote Desktop to the Office desktop computer and work from there. The reason is because the application I am working on needs to connect to servers at a Data Center via a VPN from the Office Desktop. 

My DNS domain for numeet.com (just a spare domain) was pointed to Route 53, and resolution of numeet.com and www.numeet.com is working fine. However, a subdomain called learn.numeet.com is not working, despite a CNAME. The main A record points to an elastic load balancer where a couple of servers are dealing with web traffic (once SSL is terminated on the ELB) The CNAME resolves to a specific IP address of one of the above servers (the only one that has Moodle installed). That server has a vhost setup and an elastic IP address to the subnet on the server and HTTP is fully open (and already working with the ELB). However, when 2 days after setting this up I try to got to $URL$ the DNS still does not resolve. On the EC2 instance, I can run dig learn.numeet.com, and that resolves to the IP address fine. However, even from the EC2 server, ping learn.numeet.com doesn't work. The record setup is as per the photo below:
