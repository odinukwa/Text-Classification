Just to record a nice fact, related to the answers already given: if $r, s$ are distinct slopes on the torus, then their Farey distance is bounded above by $\log_2(\iota(r,s)) + 1$, where $\iota(r, s)$ is the geometric intersection number (which is also the unsigned algebraic intersection number). A moment's thought shows that this bound is not tight. Nonetheless, writing the bound this way can be useful. 

This is an exercise. Your second step is the part that will require some thought. For a related discussion, see Rolfsen's book where he classifies simple closed curves in the annulus. They are not quasi-isometric. The fundamental group of a hyperbolic surface with punctures (and perhaps with boundary) is never isometric to its universal cover. This is because the cusps introduce distortion: a group element that winds about the cusp can be geometrically shortened (by entering the cusp) but cannot be algebraically shortened. If $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are a pair of representatives, then there is an isotopy $F$ between them. We have to choose $F$ to fix $x$, to respect the system of peripheral circles, and near the punctures be an isometry. That is, every $F_t$ is a homeomorphism of the same quality as the $\phi_i$ are. Building such an $F$ is an exercise similar to, but harder than (1) above. Now, consider $\tilde{F}$, the lift of $F$ that fixes $y$. You ask in the comments if the punctured disk and the disk with disks removed have the same mapping class group. This depends on how you define the mapping class group. Must isotopies fix boundaries pointwise? Or is each boundary equipped with a marked point, and the set of points is fixed setwise? Or perhaps there is no condition? See the book by Farb-Margalit for a discussion. 

To my knowledge this hasn't been done in theory (although see Harriet Moser's thesis $URL$ But it certainly has been done in practice by Jeff Weeks' program SnapPea. Note that $\mbox{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^3) = \mbox{PSL}(2, \mathbb{C}) = \Gamma$. So your source group $G = \pi_1(M^3)$ already has a very nice matrix group as a target. SnapPea assumes that the three-manifold $M$ is given as a triangulation. (I am sure that it is not easy to go backwards from a presentation of $G$ to a triangulation of $M$.) After tidying the triangulation (and drilling out a curve if necessary - but lets suppose that $M$ has a single torus boundary component) SnapPea gives all of the tetrahedra in the triangulation the same shape, namely that of the regular ideal tetrahedron. "Developing" in $\mathbb{H}^3$ turns shapes of tetrahedra into matrices, one per generator. Naturally this is not yet a representation of $G$ into $\Gamma$. The failure to be a representation is measured by the failure of the shapes to satisfy the Thurston gluing equations. SnapPea uses a multivariate version of Newton's method to find new shapes for the tetrahedra, hopefully converging to the discrete and faithful representation of $G$ into $\Gamma$. Details, references, and more can be found in Moser's thesis. However, I'll add a final remark - the convergence properties of SnapPea's method certainly do depend sensitively on the initial triangulation. There are certain triangulations where SnapPea will consistently produce wrong answers. This is not a problem in practice -- you randomize the triangulation a few times and SnapPea typically starts to behave much better. But finding an actual algorithm appears to be difficult. So something mysterious going on. The problem (of finding the discrete and faithful representation) is easy to solve even for very respectfully sized manifolds (say up to 100 tetrahedra). But why? I certainly don't know. You'd have to ask Thurston, Weeks, Hodgson or some other expert for an opinion. 

The $n$-dimensional cross-polytope $P_n$ can be triangulated (divided into simplices, without adding vertices) in exactly $n$ different ways. Each of these has $2^{n-1}$ simplices. A quick google search finds Example 6.3.14 in the book "Triangulations: Structures for Algorithms and Applications". They don't give a proof (and they have a typo, I think). This fact is also mentioned without proof in Example 4.9 of the paper "Splitting polytopes". Anyway, this seems to be a "standard fact". Much less seems to be known about the triangulations of $Q_n$, the "rectified $n$-simplex". 

I am not sure about your definitions, but I think that the answer has to be "no". Consider the regular decagon, with opposite sides identified. Choose a single pair of sides, and collapse those. Then the sequence and its limit $(X, \omega)$ lie in different strata. But $(X, \omega)$ is a well-behaved translation surface, so any class $[\gamma]$ has a finite limit (perhaps of zero length). 

Draw a filling collection of curves on the surface, so that the collection is permuted by $\phi$. It will also be helpful to make the number of intersection points as small as possible. Now move the curves back to their original positions using Dehn twists. This is described in Lickorish's paper. To get you started - show that if a pair of curves $a$ and $b$ meet once then you can send $a$ to $b$ using first a twist on $b$ and then a twist on $a$. 

This is the geometric version of Riemann's "problem of moduli". A connected, closed, oriented surface of genus $g$ has a moduli space of dimension $6g - 6$. One way to count the dimension of hyperbolic structures is via Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates. See also Section 10.6 of Farb and Margalit's book "Primer on mapping class groups".

In either case, the manifold $X = X_E = \SO(3)/\Stab(E)$ is called a "spherical space form" and also an "elliptical manifold". This is because $X$ is a quotient of the three-sphere by a freely acting subgroup of $\SO(4)$ -- note that $\SO(3)$ is a copy of $\RP^3$ so it is also a spherical space form. Jeff Weeks' book "The shape of space" has an elementary treatment of the geometry and topology involved. Also, here is link to Wikipedia: $URL$ The manifold $X$ is called a "prism manifold" there. Now, you ask 

Let $S$ be the underlying surface and call the image of the dotted lines $\gamma$. If we cut $S$ along $\gamma$ then $S$ falls apart into two components $X$ and $Y$ (both tori with a single boundary component). Let $X$ be the component that contains the edges $a$ and $b$. If I read your question correctly, you want the metric inside of $X$ to be flat and are willing to accept any smooth, negatively curved metric on $Y$. I'll assume that you also want the surface $S$ to be a Riemannian manifold at the end of the day. I'll also assume that you are insisting that the two edges of $\gamma$ (on its $X$ side) be straight (otherwise you can proceed as Daniel Mehkeri suggests -ie in this situation you allow $\gamma$ to "bow-in" to the $X$ side. Eg, you could take any flat torus and cut out a round disk to get $X$.) If my assumptions are correct then the answer to your question is negative. This is because in a Riemannian manifold the exponential map is well defined -- however in your surface, the dotted edges are limits of geodesic segments and hence geodesic. Thus at the square vertex the upward pointing tangent vector has two geodesic continuations, a contradiction.
