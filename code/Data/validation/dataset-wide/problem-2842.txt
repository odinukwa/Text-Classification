...is pretty much my answer: Meaning is internally constructed from (or formulated into) external physical constructs or events, which are themselves meaningless but decidedly non-arbitrary. However, what counts as "meaningful stimuli" is not objectively determinable. Rather, it's in the eye of the beholder. If we agree that removing one's glasses means buy and scratching one's chin means sell, then those are meaningful signals to us, but no one else. Thus, whether patterns of ink on paper, or photons from a display, or transistor voltages constitute "legitimate semantic representations" is neither true nor false. It depends on the potential interpreters, their capabilities, and their contexts. 

When I read this, I understood it. How? For me, the objects being processed were photons from my computer screen impinging on cells in my retinas. Those photons contained zero "semantics". However, their physical properties and configuration were far from accidental. Primarily, the semantics in your head determined them (based on a human & technical foundation). That physical signal was sufficient to cause in my head (1) a symbolic representation followed by (2) a syntactic & semantic interpretation (all based on a similar foundation), which hopefully is reasonably close to the one that your head intended (although certainly not identical). Semantics does not lie in transmitted tokens (signals). It lies in the (more or less shared) structure, function, and content (memory) of the machines doing the formulating and interpreting. 

Let's assume for a moment that the materialistic view of the universe is correct. There exists a universe that contains energy in various states spread out in the dimensions of space and time that is responsible for our existence. And let's adopt the view of time where the particle states of our brains creating the moments of experience do not disappear into nothingness once they are experienced, but continue to exist eternally as tiny slivers of the universe. Our brains are made up some form of energy in particular states at various times in space. The present moment has always existed as part of the universe, we just were not aware of it in other moments. Our brains are made of neurons connected together interacting with various other chemicals inside our skulls, creating the little reality that we experience with other people, objects, feelings, beliefs, thoughts, etc. Now in this view, the reason I am experiencing what I am experiencing is that the matter-energy making up my brain is arranged in some particular order. When constructing memories of the past, the brain activates a network of neurons that are arranged in particular way that somewhat resemble previous states, or are perhaps connected in some way to other moments in the past. So we can think about your whole life as a fixed object in spacetime made up of the whole collection of brain states of your life spread out in spacetime. The apparent movement and change is only an illusion. If the universe is destroyed, it would destroy all the objects and energy in it, past, present, and future. Yet we are here now, so we know that the universe is never destroyed. In this view, it would not make sense to say that you ever die, you just don't exist everywhere in the universe. You are contained in your little time-space, forever. It has no beginning or end. The whole thing just exists at once, but the moments of consciousness are spread out. Each moment contains a short-term memory buffer of the recent past, creating the illusion that you have somehow just moved your consciousness from another moment, when in fact the You in this moment has always been in that moment like the single frame of a movie. This is a static view of the spacetime. In this view, we would be eternally stuck with whatever way the universe just happened to exist. One problem with this is that it seems from quantum mechanics that the universe does not exist in only one state, but many states at once. We only see a small sliver of the present state at any time, but there could be more to it that we aren't seeing. If the world I am experiencing is just one particular state of atomic particles in my brain, there could be many other life stories that are a part of the universe and the one I am living in this moment is only one of many possible storylines. This comes from one interpretation of quantum mechanics that I read in David Albert's book Quantum Mechanics and Experience, which he referred to as the many-minds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Please correct me if I do not seem to be understanding something correctly. Now let's say that each particular state of matter-energy in my brain has a certain identity. Any arrangement of matter in the exact same way would create an identical existence/experience. There could be clumps of matter elsewhere in the universe somewhere else in time or at the present moment just like mine arranged the same way, experiencing exactly what I am experiencing. It could be far in the future in another galaxy. It would see the same thing I am seeing, with hands stretched out in front of it taping on a keyboard looking at letters appear on a monitor and believe the universe has existed for the same amount of time as about 13.799 billion earth trips around the sun. It would see the same weather outside and the same stars I see. If this clump of matter happened to be like my brain it would be observing everything that I am observing. But does the brain need to be exactly the same to be me? My brain has existed in many states in this body in various stages of development, with my current memories and with others. I can experience a brain injury any day and lose much of my brain, memories, and ability to function, but still, experience the universe in some way, even with a completely different personality. So the brain does not need to be identical to mine to be me. It could morph into something like your brain and still be me. I experience one moment at a time perhaps in each of the brains, unaware of the other mes out there. Constructing a coherent sense of what we mean by personal identity can become difficult in this view. Perhaps I would have to identify with just this particular instance of matter in this particular state. Perhaps as a side question here, does justice become irrelevant if materialism is true? Could it be that there is only one brain state of the many that experiences the consciousness that is somehow the optimal state? If that is right, then perhaps we all get our own little optimal universe, and perhaps the other people we observe with various brain states are not actually the real conscious states of their brains or perhaps we all exist as part of some superbrain to keep us on the same page observing the same things. Or the other people may actually exist in some other state, perhaps not associated with the story you are living in your conscious brain state. Or perhaps the past present and future are all in some sort of dynamic state at once. I'm having trouble with this, keeping it all together. It just seems odd that we have this universe exists as it does in these matter-energy states and whatever story we are living has nothing to do with it. If all we are is a jumble of chemicals making our experiences, how could we ever be confident that anything we believe is true? The particles in our brains could arrange in any such way to make us believe anything. It seems unlikely that they would arrange in such a way to hit on the truth. Does this quickly become incoherent or spell trouble for materialism? Help me out. 

As you and others here have said, your CRA reply is essentially the most common one, the Systems Reply. But your statement misses some important aspects, such as Searle's point about formal symbol manipulation, which is the one thing his CRA gets right. To understand how both things can be right: lack of semantics at the Searle-computer level and the potential for understanding at the CR-system level, one should understand the relationships among the Searle-computer and its two kinds of input. The Chinese Room's heat source is the fact that it produces two levels of Turing computation, both of which are processing the Chinese symbols. Level-1 is Searle himself, acting as a UTM-computer (a universal Turing machine; like a CPU). Level-2 is "the system" whose computation of the Chinese is determined solely by the program and its execution configuration (memory, state, etc.). Note that the existence of the two computations is a fact, not as in "I'm stating my opinion as a fact", but as in "it is an objective mathematical fact, like the Pythagorean Theorem, which anyone can understand and verify for themself". Searle's self-consciousness is a kind of 3rd level of "information processing" (which might or might not be a computation). It allows him to introspect on his own level-1 universal computation. But he cannot similarly introspect on the level-2 computation. For level-2, the Searle-UTM is merely its physical substrate, analogous to a person's neuron-level, not their consciousness-level. Thus, the Searle-UTM never knows what his program is doing, whether it is doing a Turing Test or taxes or tic-tac-toe. Also note that the Searle-UTM is processing two classes of symbols: #1 the English symbols of the program, which people always ignore, and #2 the Chinese symbols, which captivate people like shiny objects. Thus, to correctly address "symbol manipulation in the CR", one must fully address the three symbol-processing relationships: 

There are lots of different ways people talk about a Creator or creative intelligence behind existence or try to define the concept. I'm not sure how helpful these descriptions are. If there is a Creator, perhaps if you go somewhere beautiful in nature by yourself, and ask It. If It exists, perhaps it could tell you in some way that you might find more satisfying than anything someone might tell you to believe. If there is a Creator you probably would not even need to go anywhere special to find it. One interpretation might be to say that the deities, angels, demons, devils, and so forth are elements of our psyches, perhaps other ego states or elements of part of what we might call our "unconscious minds," although it does not necessarily mean they are not conscious or powerless; it just means that you are not usually conscious of them in your mind/body/world. The words and myths could be describing processes in our brains. Prayer can also be thought of as a form of self-hypnosis. You are going into a quiet peaceful state of mind and communicating with other levels of consciousness within your mind. There can be powerful healing and insight gained from that activity. However, it does not seem necessary to me to give it a bunch of labels and words or a religion. Just appreciating music and babies, and beautiful scenery is much more meaningful for some than wordy descriptions, although -what- it means might not be clear. It seems to always remain somewhat elusive if you try to pin it down. It could be something beyond our capacity to fully grasp in our normal states of consciousness or any state of consciousness. You don't even have to call it God. It could just be a felt sense of connection with the universe and your awe and appreciation for it. That is one way of thinking of it. It seems that the character(s) and personalities ascribed to it can take as many forms as there are people.
