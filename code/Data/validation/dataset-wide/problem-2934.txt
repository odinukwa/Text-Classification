The question is excessively broad, even when restricted to major religions. E.g., Christianity is a "major religion", but within its different denominations, and even within the members of a particular denomination, there are different positions with respect to the conclusions reached by modern science, depending on the understanding of "biblical inerrancy": 

Actually, the concordance of modern cosmology with the Genesis account of creation is much better now than it was in 1978. To be able to perceive that, one must be familiar with inflationary cosmology, as introduced e.g. in [2]. Noting that inflation does not leave any observable "imprints" or "signatures" of the time before the inflationary epoch (IF in fact there was such a time), it is perfectly consistent with current science to postulate that the universe began to exist at the start of the inflationary epoch, empty of matter and radiation and with only the "inflaton" scalar field that drives inflationary expansion. This hypothesis fulfills a basic requirement of science: that the initial state is maximally simple [3]. Let's now see the concordance between the biblical narrative, quoted verse by verse, and this hypothesis. Day 1 1:1 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. = Creation ex nihilo of both the spiritual (heavens) and physical (earth) universes. Alternatively, verse 1 could be a title for the narration in ch. 1. 1:2 The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. = In the inflationary epoch there was neither matter (therefore the universe was void) nor electromagnetic radiation ("light", therefore the universe was dark), but only the "inflaton" scalar field. To note, a closed (finite) universe does not have an initial singularity, since the scale factor at t=0 is nonzero and finite, and starts at rest. 1:3 And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. = At the end of the inflationary epoch, the inflaton scalar field decayed in the particles of the Standard Model (event conventionally but, in this hypothesis, improperly called "reheating", because there was no previous "hot" state), including the photons of the electromagnetic radiation, i.e. "light". These particles were initially mixed in a homogeneous hot plasma, in which photons were constantly colliding with protons and electrons, so that the universe was opaque, a "luminous fog". 1:4 And God separated the light from the darkness. = The ongoing expansion of the universe caused the gradual cooling of the hot plasma to the point in which protons could capture electrons to form electrically neutral hydrogen atoms (event conventionally but improperly called "recombination", because there was no previous state when protons and electrons were "combined"). Shortly after, photons ("light") decoupled from matter and started to travel freely (event called "photon decoupling", properly for once!). At that time, part of the initial electromagnetic radiation was still in the visible region of the spectrum, but the greatest part had alreadly redshifted into the infrared. 1:5 And there was evening and there was morning, one day. = As is well known, in the Israelite reckoning of time a day starts at sunset, so that each day is comprised of evening/night and then morning/daylight. This was strictly fulfilled in the "first day", when the universe started to exist in darkness ("there was evening"), and then "there was light" ("there was morning"). Day 2 1:6-8 And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters." And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so. And God called the expanse Heaven. = This reflects the initial formation of structure, during which dark matter started to collapse into the marginally denser regions by way of gravitational attraction, attracting in turn ordinary matter and giving origin to dark matter halos and then galaxies, leaving a void space ("expanse") between them. 1:8 And there was evening and there was morning, the second day. = Since the ongoing expansion of the universe causes a continual increase of the wavelength of the "background" electromagnetic radiation (that which started to exist at "reheating" in day 1), very shortly after "photon decoupling" that electromagnetic radiation went completely into the infrared region of the spectrum, so that the universe went back into "darkness" (from the viewpoint of hypothetical human observers) for at least 400 million years (My) ("there was evening"). Then, after the formation of structure, the massive and short-lived first-generation stars (Population III, or extremely metal-poor stars) were formed and started to emit visible light ("there was morning"). You cannot get better concordance than that. Now, the main rival to inflationary cosmology is cyclical cosmology, which posits that the Big Bang was really a Big Bounce from a previous contracting universe. That hypothesis is inconsistent with the conclusively established finding that the expansion of the universe has been accelerating during the second half of its history [4] [5], so that anyone holding it must postulate:

I will answer the question from the viewpoint of a Christian in the second camp, who believes that the Creator spoke to humanity through a Revelation along human history and through the physical universe, and in both cases spoke the truth, so that if it seems (in a scientific sense, as in a plain sense it seems that the sun moves around the Earth) that events in the universe were a certain way, they were actually that way. If the narrative of events in the book where the divine Revelation was recorded differs in its details from what we can infer from the observation of nature, it is because of divine condescendence to the low degree of scientific development of the original recipients of the Revelation, and because, as said above, through that Revelation God did not intend to teach things in no way profitable to salvation. In this framework, the actual case is not that Christianity "follows modern cosmology" but the other way around, as noted in Jayson Virissimo's answer and stated by Robert Jastrow as early as 1978: 

Evidently, the explanation of fine tuning by the Creator hypothesis cannot be "refuted" in the sense of "proven to be false".

The fact of the fine tuning of the physical constants for the development of life is not evidence for the existence of a Creator in the sense of "proof", but consistent with that existence, and highly suggestive of it for those inclined to think that the universe has an ultimate explanation and human life has meaning. A multiverse-averse atheist can reply that we do not know whether there is a space of possible values for the physical constants, or a way whereby the constants acquired their actual values. We just see a particular number, and do not know whether that number was selected from a space of possible numbers, what that hypothetical space of possible numbers was, and how the selection was performed. Maybe there was no number space, selection or Selector, and the fact of this lucky number “is just the way it is.” So, fine tuning can be: 

Yes, as there are several physically plausible ways whereby a contracting universe would not contract to a singularity but would bounce and start to expand, so that a "Big Bang" could actually be a "Big Bounce" from a "Big Crunch". Such a bouncing cosmology is seriously offered by a small minority of scientists as an alternative to mainstream inflationary cosmology [1]. 

The question is based on deficient knowledge of contemporary metrology. As can be read in the site of the Bureau International des Poids and Mesures [1], the units of time (second) and length (metre) are currently defined such that: 

There are three possible positions on this subject, held respectively by strict Platonists (are there actually any today?), theists, and atheists [1]: 

Moreover, in the revised International System of Units (SI) expected to come into force on 20 May 2019 [2], the units of mass (kilogram) and electric charge (coulomb) will be redefined such that [3]: 

Since any boolean variable can be expressed as either an AND or an OR with itself, and since in axiom 1 f(B,x) = f(x,x), it can be expressed as either: 1.a. For x = B, f(B,x) AND f(x,x). 1.b. For x = B, f(B,x) OR f(x,x). From axioms 1.a and 2, or 1.b and 2, it is clear that no valid proposition can be stated for all x in a logically self-consistent one-tidy-and-respectful-barber universe. So Russell's Paradox cannot happen. In the example of "Bess loves someone only if she doesn't love herself", a logically self-consistent Bess-loving-herself-and-the-not-self-loving universe is based on these two axioms:
