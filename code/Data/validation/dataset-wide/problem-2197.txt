As much as you may want to teach everyone else how to hold a meeting, make sure you can take control of your time first. If they can't allow you to make necessary adjustments, so you have the time to attend the meetings, you'll just have to stop going. Again, make sure your supervisor understands you are not going to a meeting because you're spending time on getting things done he/she things has more priority. If meeting attendance makes his job easier because your not going looks bad, then that is what is most important, so the other work suffers. You can't put 10 pounds of meat in a 5 pound bag (If you could then it must be a 10 pound bag.). 

If you're going to continue the work, so the project doesn't fail, what do you really expect the other people to do? Obviously the don't feel sorry for you or feel a need to work harder. You can always ask them to do more work. Then you can decide to do the work or not. Or you can just stop doing the work and see what happens. I don't know how long you have been doing this, but you've creating a bad habit for yourself. Either get over it and take pride in the fact that you do all the work for no credit. Otherwise, you're just making yourself miserable. Maybe you can keep this up, but most people can't. You can always ask for a raise and threaten the TL with leaving. Maybe he won't call your bluff. 

This may be how they do things, but it is by choice. It's not a valid reason for denying you a salary increase. If it is, what difference does it make if you have another offer? It may be more appropriate to have a conversation about your salary during an evaluation meeting. That's up to you to decide. Get some positive feedback from your boss about your performance. Based on the quality of the feedback, ask for a raise. This will be good practice for your next job interview. If your boss gives you any indication that it is impossible to increase your salary substantially, you need to let him know that it appears you have no choice but to look for another job. Maybe then, he'll come up with a better solution if he wants to keep you bad enough. 

A typical interview question is to ask about the time-frame of the hiring process. No reason they shouldn't want a potential employee to know how many interviews, with whom and when they plan on filling the position. A good interviewer should offer this information up-front. In your case, there is no magic amount of time, but they don't respond to a follow-up request, it probably means the answer is no. Start pursuing other positions. If the company contacts you again with some reason about losing your paperwork or the person handling this left the company... You can consider how sincere they are and decide to continue the process. 

There are a lot more unknowns and things you have to acccount for when you're working on a contract that are usually part of a full-time employment package (paid holiday, sick days, insurance, tax withholdings, retirement, etc.). Some of the pros and cons when comparing the two may not be the same for everyone. Do you see full-time employment as more job security or negatively because you're stuck in the same old job? Contract work may provide the opportunity to make more money in a short period of time so you can take more time off. The income may be the same in the long run, but being able to take a long holiday (more than 3 weeks) is rare when working full-time. A contractor may be in a position to network with more people and create better opportunities down the road. Many contractors were actually a full-time employee and switched to work for the same company as a contractor. This is great if it lasts and you're able to find other work. Some people are able to find new jobs, but don't see themselves as a "sales person" and may struggle with landing new business. Being a contract worker has a little over-head just like running your own business, but I think different people have different temperments, family or persona concerns that could increase or decrease different gaps in either path. 

Define what is Billable This is what your company is not doing. Do they only consider the time a developer is actually typing code as billable? When working for a client, these things should be billalbe (it's what a lawyer would do) 

We don't always get a task like this where there is a clear path to prove yourself. You're not buried in with a team. Nobody remembers who went and got the coffee. You'll display more elegance if you ask the right questions, fully understand what is expected and get help when you need it. Sorry to tell you, but eventually, the only way you're going to get out of tasks is to get fired so they can get someone else to do the job. You will feel a million times more confident and will enjoy your career by breaking through these self-imposed barriers and accomplish something you will later find meaningful. 

Your team and manager are dysfunctional, so you may have to say, "There is no room for advancement." The company isn't growing fast enough. You want to expand the technologies you work with and want to be challenged because your current project is treading water. You can't say, "I don't like my boss and he is a fool." No one cares what your opinion is of the company, but if you bad mouth them, they'll think less of you. Remember, most of your interviewing will be with management. No one wants to hire a disgruntled employee. Anything you say against management, they'll take it personally. Sorry, but that's human nature. Everyone else who has a bad boss will feel sorry for you, but they're not hiring. 

You put your name at the top. It is implied that everything on your CV would pertain to you, so there is only a need to include other people (team members) where appropriate. It gets a little repetitive 

Size of bonus. Who wouldn't stay for 6 months for an additional 50% to their salary? Most positions will never have to worrry about this. Competitive level of salary minus the bonus. Some companies like a startup may not be able to put together an anual salary that is competitive so they've tried to make it more attractive by providing cash up front. The downside is, your raise is probably a percentage of base salary. A too low of a salary where bonuses and raises are based, limits the compounding factor on future income potential. Length of the terms. Over three months seems close to trying to lock you in. Anyone who stays somewhere less than this is really hurting their career beyond the size of the bous. Stage of career. This can be a huge benefit to someone just starting out. Possible way to help someone who is relocating, so it's not really a bonus. They should reimburse you for the expenses (I think this is a tax break as well). 

I don't have an example of a programmer hiring workflow, but here is an outline of what you should do to create one that fits this company. 

This person is not likely to change this behavior over-night since she doesn't have the personality tendency to behave differently. It is important that someone point out this flaw, but you're not going to be able to follow-up and provide any useful feedback in only two weeks. She really needs an ally to help her through this. If you're able to get cooperation from another employee, who could take over this process of helping this person, you should consider it. Talk to her first and see what she thinks. Suggest getting help from someone else in the company. Just pointing out this flaw without any intention of helping with a solution (sometimes people need professional help), could hinder your relationship. Basically, you'll be burning a bridge. 

Talk to your boss. You were lead to believe deserve a much higher raise. Your boss is the one who will suffer the most if he thinks you are doing such a great, but loses you to another job because of his mistake. They've risked losing your trust. In the future, you should ask how your salary, bonus and any potential raises are determined. Don't leave things up to what is common. Companies and managers who won't be comfortable discussing this during a salary negotiation are either being evasive and/or weak leaders. 

If your managers are not aware of the negative impact of interruptions and distractions on programmers, you probably have more problems than this. A place to start would be some sort of benchmark on project/development completion before this change and compare it to where you are now. These metrics aren't perfect, but when the same programmers, using the same language working on the same project and getting fewer user stories completed during a sprint, something has changed and it's not for the better. Of course someone could push-back and argue about the inaccuracies of measuring programmer's output, but that person wouldn't be foolish enough to put programmers in the same room with a bunch of people who talk on the phone all day.
