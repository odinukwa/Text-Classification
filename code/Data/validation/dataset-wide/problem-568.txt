Weight and durability are indeed factors, but it's also about the performance of components. The "high level" bikes are for a "high level" of performance. They're usually designed with competition in mind. The shifting has to be perfect, the brakes need just the right amount of power, the suspension has all kinds of adjustments, tires specific to the terrain on that day are used, etc. Of course, Average Wealthy Joe will buy one of those bikes and brag about it, but hey, be happy he's financing your favourite bike companies. ;) 

Aluminum is more durable, but highly used PVC rollers have been seen to hit the decade mark so it's not really a big difference maker. The other difference would be that PVC rollers charge up static electricity and it can be annoying to get zapped every time you ride your rollers. Now it's up to you to see if that's worth an extra 90$. It's most likely possible to ground the rollers to avoid the shocks and save some money. (The main difference is that PVC rollers can't really be used outside, but it doesn't matter here.) 

I would recommend first checking on what Noah recommended: checking that the crank bolts are tightened down to the proper torque. If they are, I would start with the following steps: 

To align the caliper, loosen the caliper bolts and bring the fixed cpad as close as possible to the rotor without rubbing. Then dial in the fixed pad so that it is as close as possible without rubbing. Then install your cable/housing, and begin adjusting. To improve brake feel, pre-stretch your cable before making adjustments. Take the wheel out, out a pad spacer in (Pedro's tire lever works great, or any other non-metal object), and squeeze the lever as hard as you can ten times. This will seat the housing into the ferrules, as well as stretch the cable out. If the pads are sitting in a "V", then the brake pad spring most likely needs replacing. You could also try spreading it open a bit first, but the springs are so cheap that it's worth it just to get new ones. P.S. The Alfine dynamo actually uses loose ball bearings, making it re-packable. It's tricky, due to the wiring connectors, but it's nice to be able to do it yourself. Avid Brake Pad Spring 

I recently lost the keys to my lock and had to borrow a bolt cutter to free my bike. It was a bit of an eye opener to realise a) just how easy it was for the bolt cutters to cut through my D Lock (<10 seconds), and b) that nobody on a busy town shopping street batted an eyelid at me doing so. When choosing a new lock, is there any brand name, or build material to go for that makes it harder to cut through (using relatively small/discrete bolt cutters)? 

Every 150 miles sounds like an awful lot, but then I guess I don't cycle as much as you. "Little & Often" is the best advice I've heard. 

I'll need a new saddle for my bike soon. I use it mainly for short commutes (30 minutes). About once a year I go touring for a few days, up 8 hours in the saddle. My current saddle just came with the bike. I see there are a lot of different saddle types available now, from the ultra thin, to the wide & comfy to the downright fruity.I associate the thin saddles with racers, but thats the limit of my knowledge. When choosing a new saddle, should I choose based on my body frame or my cycling type (i.e. get one for short commutes, one for touring)? 

It's more dangerous as a kid to flip over your bars because there is much less weight preventing the bike from pivoting around your front wheel when you use your front brake. The danger still exists as an adult, but using the front brake definitely improves braking performance. If you don't slam the brake there shouldn't be any problems. Additionally you might want to keep your weight on the back of the bike while braking downhill. Sheldon Brown covers the topic of braking, you might want to give it a read. 

Since you don't hear the noise when the bike is up on the stand, the problem is probably linked to the load of your weight on the bike (trying to formulate this in a way that doesn't sound like I'm saying you're a problem or you're overweight but it's impossible! haha). Sit on the bike, swing on the saddle to simulate the effect of a bump and have someone check if there's anything swinging/bending and touching a part of your wheel. If you're really desperate and have some time on your hands, remove the luggage rack and go see if you hear that noise. Then re-install it carefully. Actually you might save some time doing this right off the bat. 

Install the cassette and derailleur. Measure your chain to the correct length (using Park Tool's 3rd method), but do not cut the chain yet. Add an additional link (outer/inner) to the total chain length. Cut the chain, install, and check the shifting function. Adjust the B-tension screw in on the derailleur so that the chain and upper jockey wheel on the derailleur do not grind against the largest rear cog. 

Remove the cranks and bottom bracket, and check the adjustable bottom bracket cup (on the left side of the bike, when you are sitting on it). A UN-26 will have a plastic cup, which is usually a light tan color. If you've over- or under-tightened the adjustable cup, it can crack fairly quickly. This is especially true for heavier riders, or riders who tend to "mash" on the pedals up hills. This cracking will allow the bottom bracket to move in the frame, and it will wear quickly because it is not fully supported. If the adjustable cup is not cracked or loose, move on to the fixed cup (on the right side of the bike). If it is easy to remove (being only finger tight, or taking almost no effort to remove), the bottom bracket will be able to move in the frame when you are pedaling. It will wear quickly for the same reason as #1: it is unsupported in the frame. If neither cup is loose, or the non-drive side is not cracked, the bottom bracket shell (the part of the frame that the bottom bracket threads into) faces may not be properly aligned. The lip of the drive-side cup rests against the bottom bracket shell face. 

You call The person understands your troubles and will make sure the message is delivered The person who received the call says to the driver "Hey, someone complained about your bad driving!" "Oh really? random comment" Everyone laughs it off Moving on 

I know someone who's on the receiving end of those bad-driving complaints for a company that has a "Tell us about how I drive phone number here" sticker on their trucks. I know that I have a small sample, but it's probably representative of how it works in most companies. Here's how it goes: 

www.roadbikereview.com (see also mtbr.com for the Mountain bike version) doesn't have actual comparisons, but there are user reviews for a wide variety of models and bike parts. 

If you suspect that the faces are out of alignment, you may want to take the frame to your local shop to have the bottom bracket faced. This will cost between $20-$40, and will typically also include the chasing of the bottom bracket threads as well. Finally, you may want to consider a higher quality bottom bracket. The UN-26 is entry-level quality, but if you are riding regularly and/or in inclement weather, it will wear out quickly regardless of installation quality. 

There are two possibilities: 1.) The roller brake mechanism and internals are completely seized. Based on the level of rust on the outside of the brake, there is a strong possibility that there is rust inside as well. Shimano roller brakes do need to be in fairly good condition, and have the correct Shimano grease in them to work well. If the brake had a very thick type of grease injected into it, it may have gummed up the brake completely. The Shimano Nexave roller brakes, are technically serviceable, but are not warrantied by Shimano if opened up. They are designed as a complete unit; replacement internals are not available, and must be scavenged from other brakes. Most shops will typically not service the internals; know that if a shop is willing to, there are no new parts going into the brake. Nexave brakes are fairly inexpensive, and any good shop should be able to supply you with a replacement, and install it as well. Despite my normal recommendations to overhaul existing equipment, this is one instance where replacement is the best route. 2.) You are possibly missing a spacer/locknut between the brake drum and the frame. While this is not your exact brake, the parts are similar. You may be missing item #2. It looks as though the end of the fork blade may be contacting the drum, and exerting pressure on the drum, preventing it from springing back. Be sure that there is the appropriate locknut holding the brake unit in place, and the over-locknut dimension is 100mm. This is only likely if the hub has been overhauled, and the brake was put on incorrectly, with the locknut missing. The reason the brake works while rolling backwards is that the drum is being pushed in the "open" direction, loosening the internals (from whatever is making them stick), and allowing the brake to operate normally. 

It really depends on your budget, but you should check this out (or anything similar), from Gore bike wear : 

What you need to know is the type of mounting you have on your fork and on your brakes to know what adaptor you need to get. There are IS (so-called international standard, used by Hope and Formula, among others), Post (used by Rockshox, Marzocchi for forks and Avid, Hayes for brakes, among others) and some manufacturer and/or fork specific mounts. According to the link you provided, the fork has Post mounts. (From the description: Lower tubes: Magnesium, Post-disc mount). Hope uses IS mounts. So you need a Front IS to Post adaptor. See this for an example The size of your disc is another important thing to know, since you might need a bigger adaptor for it. 

I'm considering getting an indoor cycle trainer . I had a look on ebay. There are a lot, and the price ranges from under 20 pounds to several hundred pounds. Quality and function range accordingly, so I'm a bit lost. My main reason for getting it is to use it for cardio fitness training. So, I'm looking for something that meets these criteria 

My commute was fairly short, so my major burden was the rain. For this I invested in rain proof panniers & waterproof jacket & over-trousers. I had both a summer & winter jacket to make sure I didn't arrive in too hot during summer. I didn't have overshoes, so kept spare socks/shoes at office. I cycled at leisurely pace on way there to avoid building up too much of a sweat. I'd let rip on the way home to make up for that. I had a colleague who cycled in from further afield, and wore the spandex gear. He just discretely got changed in the toilets when he arrived. It was never an issue (odour wise) - I guess he went with the babywipes & deodorant. Our dress code was pretty casual. If you need to be smart, just bring your freshly ironed office clothes in a pannier. See if you can get a suction bag to prevent them from flopping all over the place enroute.

The different lengths of suspension will affect the geometry by giving your bike a steeper (or not) head angle. Too much travel might make it tougher to pedal as well, depending on the fork's settings. A too long/short fork (compared to what it was designed to use) might put some unnecessary stress on the tubes and for that reason forks outside of a certain range void warranties. The blur is designed for a 5.5 in / 140 mm fork. I'd suggest going to a local Santa Cruz dealer (if such a thing exists where you live) and ask them if 120 mm is fine too. 

If for some reason you can't adjust the drivetrain noise out, then forget it. Any of the above factors may make it impossible. It's unusual, but it does sometimes happen. If there is excessive slack in the chain in the small ring/small cog combination, it's also probably not a great idea. However, I would not worry a great deal; Shimano SS cages have never been compatible with 28t cogs, but tons of people run them all the time. It's for legal protection that Shimano states this. What you really need to run an SS cage and a 28t cassette is mechanical know how (or a good shop mechanic!) 

It may be a broken brake shoe, or possibly a broken clutch spring. This usually happens when the axle nuts are not tightened to the correct torque (30Nm), or the wheel is put back on without the non-turn washer. Take it into a shop that has a Shimano dealer account. If you want to fix it yourself, they can order you the entire internal assembly (it comes in one pre-assembled piece, part #1 on this diagram). Make sure you emasure the length of the old axle, and order the same sized new one. With some minimal work (this link), you can remove the old assembly, pop in the new one, and get your girlfriend back to riding. NOTE: The above video shows how to remove the coaster brake shoes. You are not trying to do that! Simply replace the entire unit. If you'd rather not do the work yourself, a shop shouldn't charge too much for it, and the work will be warrantied as well. They can also check the hub for any other damage.
