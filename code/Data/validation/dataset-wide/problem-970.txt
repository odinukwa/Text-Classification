I want to add some nice examples of how divergent plate movement can actually create mountains, not destroy them. Here are two photographs I took several years ago from the Red Sea rift near Eilat, Israel: 

Start by reading my answer on a different website: $URL$ This is a quick explainer on what "reserves" actually are. 

Yes. Water, or more precisely, H2O acts as a flux: it is a chemical component that strongly lowers the melting temperatures of various materials, including rocks. It follows the basic chemical reaction of $\ce{rock + H2O = melt-with-H2O-dissolved-in-it}$. The important part is that to allow H2O to be dissolved in the melt, you need to have some pressure. Otherwise the H2O just exsolves out and leaves the magma, similar to opening a bottle of carbonated drink (think coke). While there is pressure, the CO2 is in the drink. When you open the cap and depressurise it, the CO2 comes out of the drink. Something similar happens in magmas. You have a felsic magma with H2O dissolved in it (otherwise it wouldn't be liquid, it would be solid) rising upwards through the crust. Because it goes up, the pressure around it goes down, causing H2O to leave the magma as bubbles of water vapour (or a supercritical fluid, depending on depth). Then, as the magma loses the flux, it solidifies before it can even reach the surface. Here's a diagram to explain this, in the albite-H2O simplified system, which is a good model for granites and felsic magmas: 

Here is another example where the law of superposition breaks. Mind you this is a natural process: meteorite impacts. A meteorite impact will excavate material from the bottom, and deposit it above the crater rims. Here's how: 

At surface pressure (bottom of the diagram) albite melts at slightly above 1100 °C. In a dry system, the higher the pressure, the higher the temperature. For example, at 5 kbar (0.5 GPa) the melting point of albite goes up to 1200 °C. If you add H2O at surface pressures, it doesn't change anything because there is not enough pressure to put the H2O in the (non-existing) melt. But at higher pressure it is possible for H2O to dissolve in the melt, thus allowing the existence of melt. For example at 5 kbar the melting point of albite with more than enough (aka saturated) H2O goes down to 800 °C. That's 400 °C below the dry melting point! So what would happen if a melt containing some H2O starts rising upwards at constant temperature? For example at point a to d in the diagram. It will lose H2O as it rises, increasing the solidus temperature. Because the magma is not hot enough to be liquid at the surface, it will freeze before that, while still at depth. 

If I understand it right, you are assuming that in the beginning we had CO2, which was then split to organic carbon and O2 via photosynthesis. And now you are asking if it's possible to reverse all of that by burning all organic carbon, so that it consumes the O2. Your assumption is not quite right. Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth's crust and mantle, locked up in rocks. Rocks are made out of mostly oxygen. Atmospheric oxygen is negligible, when looked up in the context of the entire Earth. Oxygen is constantly being consumed and produced by reactions between the atmosphere and the solid Earth. Not only that, there are processes in the Earth that take sediments and pull it down deep into the Earth, in subduction zones. Anything can be subducted: both organic unoxidised carbon and oxidised carbon in the form of carbonates (e.g. limestone). This goes down to tens to several hundreds of kilometres, far away from any interaction with the atmosphere. As an example, let's say that you have a forest which that consumes a certain amount of CO2 and H2O, generating organic carbon-hydrogen and releasing the excess O2 to the atmosphere. Now you have carbon (and hydrogen) locked up in solids. Some of this organic material burns, decomposes, or otherwise reacts with atmospheric O2 to generate CO2 and H2O all over again. However, some of it is buried deep in the Earth's crust (that's how we get coal, gas and oil). So in theory, we can extract and mine everything, and then burn it. However, some of it is buried even deeper and is carried down by subduction to the Earth's mantle. In there, it is far away from our reach and there is no way we can extract it to burn it. So the oxygen generated while producing this organic material lingers in the atmosphere, but the organic material itself is deep below in the mantle, unable to react with any oxygen (as O2, any redox reactions are a different story). To sum it up, your point of view is too simplistic as it does not take into account the Earth as a whole, but only top soil and atmosphere. 

This will have minerals, obviously. This might also have fossils: what if there were organisms around while the chemical rock formed? Could be fossils falling from above into a carbonate precipitate, or insects in an evaporite basin. However, this is probably the least likely rock to contain fossils. If you have to choose only one, this would be it (unfortunately). 

Because of the contrasting bonding properties of the metallic and sulfide liquids, trace elements partition differently to them. For example, Te and Cu will "feel more comfortable" in sulfide liquid, whereas Ir and Au will prefer the liquid Fe metal. How does this fit in the bigger picture? The main importance of the siderophile-element category is that there are not enough of them. When you look at how much siderophile elements there are in the solar system, and then compare to how much we have in the crust and mantle, there are not enough. This is especially true for the highly siderophile elements (HSE: Au, Re, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt). This is unfortunate, because these are very useful metals. We could all use some more Au, Pt and Ir. The accepted explanation is that when the Earth formed, the liquid Fe metal that sunk to the core scavenged the siderophile elements from the surrounding silicate (lithophile-nearing) magma ocean and locked them in the core, far away from us. But this occurred a very long time ago, and has little relevance for moving the siderophile elements around in more recent times, and in places closer to us. In the absence of liquid metal, siderophile elements actually behave as chalcophiles. Ore deposits of HSE and particularly the platinum group elements (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt) occur in sulfides. 

The only way "science" would say there are ancient artifacts from a past civilisation is if there is evidence to support that. This is not some kind of default thing science resorts to when it cannot explain something. This is also something that UFOists like: you see a light in the sky and you can't explain it, so it has to be an alien spaceship. No - it only means that you do not know what it is. Beautifully summed up by this meme: 

The only landmass here is New Zealand, eastern Australia, eastern PNG, western North America and some Pacific islands. I'm pretty sure you can tweak it a bit, but that's the basic idea. Notice that this actually shows less than a half because of the relatively low altitude. If you "zoom out" infinitely you'll get some more Australia and more America in this, but it's still going to be mostly ocean. 

Occasionally there are news about a major ore deposit for a specific commodity being found. Some of these recent discoveries are underground, and the "geophysics" aspect of their exploration is more important than the "geology" aspect. This makes me wonder—are there any such known ore deposits that have been found under cities? Some examples might be "the largest gold deposit ever, under Buckingham Palace" or "diamond bearing kimberlite pipe under Central Park in New York". 

Although this is a somewhat poorly researched question, I think there is an opportunity to make a nice point here. First of all, let's look at the Mohs scale: 

I'm not sure what the question is. Usually higher grade metamorphic rocks have larger grain size. For example, greenschist facies rocks are commonly fine grained (for example phyllites or schists) whereas eclogite facies rocks are usually composed of big beautiful crystals, sometimes in the cm scale. 

That is the multimillion dollar question! "looking for surface formations" is indeed one way, and it was the main method of exploration in the past. This does not necessarily mean that you directly see the ore deposit in front of your eyes. Many ore-forming systems are accompanied by different kinds of alteration (for example potassic or argillic alteration) that are not too hard to see in the field. Once you see them, there is a possibility that an ore deposit is nearby. Other surface methods include, among others, looking at rivers sediments. Since rivers transport soils and rocks from upstream, sampling the sediments may reveal an anomaly in a certain commodity of interest that may lie somewhere upstream. It is also possible to use satellite data - by looking at certain wavelengths it is possible to estimate the mineralogical composition of the surface. This may give hints on the possibility of mineralisation. I've even seen cases where people used different kinds of vegetation that grows on different lithologies! Surface methods, however, require that the mineralisation will be close to the surface, and the truth is that most of the ore deposits that satisfy that requirement have already been found. This is where geophysical methods come into place. Gravimetric, magnetic and seismic studies probe the earth below the surface and may provide exploration targets, which are then drilled to see what's actually in there. Mineral exploration is a hard business with much more failures than successes. That said, cases of serendipity are not unknown in exploration. Also, changes in global economics, production costs and increasing/decreasing metal prices may change what is actually an economically feasible ore deposit. The metals are always there - but is it actually worth taking them out? 

That's because such a list does not exist. The 'first few most common minerals' you mentioned, aka the 'rock-forming minerals' account for 99.9% (at least, depends on definition) of the minerals you will find in near-surface environments. It also depends on location - the minerals you will find in a limestone are will be completely different from the minerals in granitic areas. I also don't completely seem to understand what you mean by 'macroscopic quantities'. Are you referring to minerals that are large enough to be seem by the naked eye or that are abundant in quantity regardless of their size? 

The melting point of minerals in isolation, or a pure substance is higher than mixtures of minerals. For example - a (well-mixed) mixture of quartz and pyroxene will melt at a lower temperature than pure quartz or pure pyroxene. The exact temperature is dependent on the proportions. In general, the more different kind of components (i.e. "things": minerals, elements, molecules, etc) you add to a mixture, the lower the melting point of the mixture as a whole. For example, sea water melts at -2 °C because it's a mixture of water (melts at 0 °C) and all kinds of salts. Steel melts at a lower temperature than pure iron because it's a mixture of iron and carbon. 

The black bit (called Brunhes) is now - when the magnetic field is "normal". The white field in the bottom is more than ~780 thousand years ago, when it was reversed (called Matuyama). As you can see, even though the magnetic field has been normal though this entire time, the intensity went up and down. So yes, a reversal would mean that at one point the intensity would be very low, but this can happen even without a reversal.

Impact diamonds Yes, diamonds can form in meteorite impacts. For this several things need to happen: 

(source) You can see that shallow mantle rocks are in the 300-500°C range. The arc volcanoes that you see in that figure are situated above the areas where fluids from the subducting slab can infiltrate hot (1000ish°C) mantle rocks. So you can use the Japan Sea as an analogue for Troodos in this case. Now, it is true that temperatures were likely higher because magmatic activity did occur in Troodos, but as Troodos was a slow-spreading center, the magmatic activity was rather sporadic and localized. The Nuriel et al. (2009) paper that Lanzafame refers to actually advocates the idea that Troodos was a core-complex. That is, the mantle rocks were directly exposed to seawater due to faulting, which both cooled them considerably and facilitated serpentinization. The Troodos ophiolite is indeed a supra-subduction zone ophiolite. And it is reasonable to think that arc volcanism occurred somewhere, but the record is absent from the Troodos ophiolite itself. If you are interested, look up "a h f robertson" on Google Scholar and read some of his newer work. The article you cited is from the 70s and much research has been conducted since then. 

The colour. Usually colour is not diagnostic of the a mineral type, but when beryls are green - they look precisely like this. Hardness. You say it's 7.5 so by that I understand that you mean it's harder than quartz (softer than topaz). There aren't many mineral harder than quartz than quartz that look like this. Beryl is one of the more common. The crystal shape. Beryl is commonly elongated just like yours, and it's hexagonal. The last picture clearly shows that it is hexagonal. It just looks like beryl. Sorry for being non-scientific about it, but with some experience you learn how some minerals look like. And this one looks like beryl. 

Oxygen is always divalent negative. An oxide has to be charge balanced, meaning the total has to be zero. 

Quartz is one of the most common vein material in Earth's crust, and for a reason. SiO2 is not a particularly soluble compound at the surface, but once you get deeper it becomes extremely soluble (source): 

"Basalt" per definition is a fine grained rock (that is, you can't see the individual crystals with the naked eye, aka aphanitic) with a certain chemical composition. The coarse grained form of this rock is called a "gabbro". A diabase (or dolerite) is something in between, but let's ignore it for the meanwhile for the sake of simplicity. So quoting from your question: 

This is a really bad question, because all three can lack fossils, or all three can have fossils. The definition of "minerals" is also a bit unclear, because fossils are also made out of minerals. I'll assume that by minerals they mean non-biogenic minerals. Let's go through each one of them:
