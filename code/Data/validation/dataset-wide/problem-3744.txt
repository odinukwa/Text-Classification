Consider the Sobolev spaces with $p=2$, defined for $s \in \mathbb{R}$ as \begin{equation} W^{s} = \left\{ u \in \mathcal{S}', \ (1 + \lvert \cdot \rvert^2)^{{s}/{2}} \widehat{u} \in L_2 \right\}. \end{equation} It is a Hilbert space for the norm $\lVert u \rVert_{W^s} = \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}} (1 + \lvert \xi \rvert^2)^s \lvert \widehat{u} (\xi) \rvert^2 \mathrm{d} \xi \right)^{1/2}$. The weighted Sobolev space $W^{s,r}$ is now defined for $s,r \in \mathbb{R}$ as \begin{equation} W^{s,r} = \left\{ u \in \mathcal{S}', \ (1 + \lvert \cdot \rvert^2)^{{r}/{2}} u \in W^s \right\}. \end{equation} Again, it is a Hilbert space for the norm $\lVert u \rVert_{W^{s,r}} = \lVert (1 + \lvert \cdot \rvert^2)^{{r}/{2}} u \rVert_{W^s}$. We have the obvious embeddings, for $s_1 \leq s_2$ and $r_1 \leq r_2$, \begin{align} W^{s_2,r} \subseteq W^{s_1,r}, \\ W^{s,r_2} \subseteq W^{s,r_1}. \end{align} Now, is the following result true? Conjecture: Fix $s_1, s_2, r_1, r_2 \in \mathbb{R}$. Then, \begin{equation} W^{s_1,r_1} \cap W^{s_2,r_2} = W^{\max(s_1,s_2),\max(r_1,r_2)}. \end{equation} Of course, due to the embeddings above, $W^{\max(s_1,s_2),\max(r_1,r_2)}$ is included in $W^{s_1,r_1}$ and $W^{s_2,r_2}$ and therefore in their intersection. Is the other inclusion also valid? 

An easy calculus exercise gives the blue area as $\frac{a^p}p$ and the green area as $\frac{b^q}q$, hence their sum dominates the area $ab$ of the rectangle outlined in red. I learned this proof from Cohn's measure theory book, where it appears as an exercise (in Section 3.3). 

Let $X = \Sigma_p^+ = \{1,\dots,p\}^\mathbb{N}$ and let $f=\sigma\colon X\to X$ be the shift map. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the space of Borel $f$-invariant probability measures on $X$ endowed with the weak* topology. Now $\mathcal{M}$ is a Choquet simplex, and hence connected. The geometry of its extreme points is a little more subtle. These extreme points are precisely the ergodic measures. Let $\mathcal{M}^e$ denote the collection of ergodic measures in $\mathcal{M}$. Note that $\mathcal{M}^e$ has some nice properties; for instance, there is a natural embedding from the space of Hölder continuous functions into $\mathcal{M}^e$ that takes $\phi$ to its unique equilibrium state $\mu_\phi$. The image of the embedding is the collection of Gibbs measures (for Hölder potentials). Of course, there are many ergodic measures that do not arise as equilibrium states of Hölder continuous functions, and so I wonder which nice properties of the collection of Gibbs measures extend to $\mathcal{M}^e$. In particular: Is $\mathcal{M}^e$ connected? Path connected? I expect that it is, and that moreover this should happen whenever $X$ is a compact metric space and $f\colon X\to X$ is a continuous map satisfying the specification property, but I don't know a reference and don't yet see how to approach a proof. 

Since decades, mathematicians are studying function spaces, discovering new structures more and more adapted for a general theory of functional analysis. In that works, sequence spaces are generally seen as a very simple example of "function" spaces. They become interesting in approximation theory (for instance to obtain some interesting characterization of Besov spaces using wavelet theory), being isomorphic to some important function spaces. However, I was unable to find a good reference discussing important questions of functional analysis for the special case of sequence spaces, and discussing the particularity of this "simple" case, actually the simpler in infinite dimension. I precise a bit my request with the kind of topics I am interested in. 

For infinitely divisible random variables, Blumenthal and Getoor introduced in [1] an index that allow to study for instance the local Hölder regularity of Lévy processes. For a symmetric infinitely divisible random variable $X$ with characteristic exponent $\psi$ and Lévy measure $\nu$, we have in particular \begin{align} \beta &= \inf \{ p>0; \frac{\psi(t)}{\lvert t \rvert^p} \underset{\lvert t \rvert \rightarrow \infty}{\longrightarrow} 0 \} \\ &= \inf \{ \alpha >0 ; \int_{|x|< 1} |x|^\alpha \nu (\mathrm{d}x) <\infty\}. \end{align} Knowing the Lévy measure, it is in general straightforward to find $\beta$. However, for some infinitely divisible laws, the Lévy measure does not seem to be known. Typically, for the best of my knowledge, this is the case for the student $t$-distribution $$p_v(x) \propto (1+x^2)^{-\frac{v+1}{2}}, $$ which is shown to be infinitely divisible (cf. [2]). Is the Blumenthal-Getoor index of $p_v$ known? [1] R. M. Blumenthal and R. K. Getoor, Sample functions of stochastic processes with stationary independent increments, J. Math. Mech. 10 (1961), pp. 493–516 [2] M.E.H. Ismail, Bessel functions and the infinitely divisibility of the Student $t$-distribution, The Annals of Probability, Vol. 5, N. 4 (Aug. 1977), pp. 582-585 

Then $L=[0,1)$ is not closed. In the other direction, given any closed $L$, it is possible to construct a vector field realising that $L$. Indeed, begin by constructing a map $f\colon [0,\infty)\to [0,\infty)$ such that $L = \{ x \mid f(x)=x \}$, and then construct a flow whose first return map to the positive $x$-axis is the map $f$. To construct the map, just observe that the complement of $L$ is a countable union of open intervals, and so you can define $f(x) = x$ for all $x\in L$, and then define $f$ on each open interval $(a,b)$ as a "north-south" map, that is, a map of the interval $[a,b]$ that fixes $a$ and $b$ and moves every other point towards $b$. To construct the flow from the map, just draw circles of radius $x$ for every $x\in L$, and then spirals connecting $(x,0)$ to $(f(x),0)$ for every $x\notin L$. This still leaves open the question of which non-closed sets can be realised. Clearly there's a topological obstruction to using the procedure at the beginning of my answer to remove lots of boundary points from $L$; indeed, once you remove a single boundary point that way, then the trajectory starting at any larger value of $x$ cannot wind around the origin, and so life becomes a little more complicated... Edit: Here's a more general construction. Let $X(x,y) = (-y,x)$ so that the flow is along circles centred at the origin. Fix any closed set $E\subset (0,\infty)$ and let $\phi(x,y) = 0$ precisely when $x=0$ and $y\in E$, with $\phi>0$ everywhere else. Then the flow for the vector field $\phi X$ has the property that the set of $x>0$ for which $(x,0)$ is contained in a closed orbit is precisely the set of $x$ not contained in $E$. Thus you can get any open set as your set $L$. Indeed, you can combine the two constructions to get any set that can be written as the intersection of an open set and a closed set. There's probably other stuff you can do too, but this illustrates some of the things that can happen. 

Numerous papers are referring to the following one R. M. Blumenthal and R. K. Getoor, Sample functions of stochastic processes with stationary independent increments, J. Math. Mech. 10 (1961), 493–516 in the literature, where they authors define what is now referred as the Blumenthal-Getoor index. However, I couldn't find this reference in the traditional databases, either on the website of this journal (does it still exist?). Does anyone have some information to find this paper? Thank you. 

I am using the notations, definitions, and results of the Section X of [1] on generalized Orlicz spaces. We say that $\varphi : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ is a $\varphi$-function if it is symmetric, nondecreasing, continuous, and satisfies $\varphi(0) = 0$. Then, for a measure space $(\Omega, \Sigma, \mu)$ and $\varphi$ a $\varphi$-function, $L^{\varphi}(\mu)$ is the set of measurable functions $f : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that \begin{equation} \rho_\varphi (\alpha f) := \int_{\Omega} \varphi( \alpha f ) \mathrm{d}\mu < \infty \end{equation} for some $\alpha > 0$. We call $L^\varphi(\mu)$ a generalized Orlicz space. We set \begin{align} \lVert f \rVert_\varphi = \inf \{ k > 0, \int_{\Omega} \varphi \left( \frac{\alpha f }{k}\right) \mathrm{d}\mu \leq k\}. \end{align} Then, $(L^{\varphi}(\mu),\lVert \cdot \rVert_\varphi)$ is a complete linear metric space (after identifying $f_1$ and $f_2$ when $\lVert f_1 - f_2 \rVert_\varphi = 0$), cf. [1], Section X, Theorem 2. Question: Consider a continuous and linear operator $\mathrm{L}$ between two generalized Orlicz spaces $L^\varphi(\mu)$ and $L^\psi(\mu)$. When is it true that there exists a constant $C>0$ such that \begin{equation} \rho_\psi(\mathrm{L} f) \leq C \rho_\varphi(f) \end{equation} for every $f \in L^\varphi(\mu)$? Some motivations: When the function $\varphi$ is convex, $\rho_\varphi$ defines a norm on $L^\varphi(\mu)$ that is therefore a Banach space. We talk in that case of Orlicz spaces. Here, we do not assume that $\varphi$ is convex, and not even that $\varphi$ goes to infinity at infinity. This situation occurs in the study of infinitely divisible random variables taking values in spaces of infinite dimension, see for instance [2]. Still, $\mathrm{L}$ being continuous and linear, it is bounded for the metrics $\lVert \cdot \rVert_{\varphi}$ and $\lVert \cdot \rVert_{\psi}$ but it is not so clear to me what can we say for the quantities $\rho_{\varphi}$ and $\rho_{\psi}$ in the general case.

I expect that there's a general result along these lines, and that it is quite standard and well-known. But I don't know it (and I'd rather re-invent the wheel as few times as possible). Can someone help me out with a statement of a general theorem, and ideally a reference? Edit: Since that was kind of rambling, here's the specific question. Let $B(r)$ denote the (open) ball of radius $r$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ centred at the origin. Suppose $f\colon B(\delta) \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image, and suppose $\overline{f(B(\delta))} \subset B(\epsilon)$. Let $\delta' < \delta$. Does there necessarily exist a diffeomorphism $F\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ that agrees with $f$ on $B(\delta')$ and is the identity map outside of $B(\epsilon)$? I think we need to require that $Df(0)$ have positive determinant. Are there any other obstructions? If there are, can they be removed (for a given $f$) by decreasing $\delta$ so that $f$ is close to being a linear map? Is there a general theorem from which all this follows? 

If the $X_i$ are i.i.d. Gaussian with variance $1$, then you have $$ c_p := \mathbb{E} |X_k|^p = \frac{2^{p/2} \Gamma(\frac{p+1}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi}}.$$ The variable $S_n$ is also Gaussian with variance $n$, therefore you have $$\mathbb{E} |S_n|^p = c_p n^{p/2}.$$ Hence, $\frac{\sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E} |X_k|^p}{\mathbb{E} |S_n|^p} = n^{1-p/2} \rightarrow \infty$ for $1<p<2$. At least, it means that you cannot hope for a constant $C$ as you expected. 

Consider the family of Besov spaces $B_{p,q}^{s}(\mathbb{R})$ with $0<p,q \leq \infty$ and $s \in \mathbb{R}$. Is there a natural way to define spaces of generalized functions $f(t,x) \in \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^2)$ such that, for any test function $\varphi \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$, we have $$ \langle f(t,\cdot), \varphi(t) \rangle \in B_{p_1,q_1}^{s_1}(\mathbb{R}) \quad \text{ and } \quad \langle f(\cdot , x), \varphi(x) \rangle \in B_{p_2,q_2}^{s_2}(\mathbb{R}) ?$$ That is, $f$ has a given Besov regularity with respect to the first coordinate, and another one with respect to the second coordinate? I am interested by a family of function spaces with nice structure, that has similar properties than the Besov spaces: (quasi-)Banach structure, characterization using wavelet bases, etc. This question is motivated by analysis of solutions of PDEs where space $x$ and time $t$ should be treated somehow separately. 

Note that not all vertices may be accessible from the original vertex $(0,0)$, and so you actually are only concerned with a subset of $\mathbb{N}^2$. Note also that there are two "distinguished rays" in the graph. One of these corresponds to incrementing $i$ at every step, and is labeled with the sequence $a$. The other corresponds to incrementing $j$ at every step, and is labeled with the sequence $b$. This corresponds to the characteristic sequence $z$ that determines the $\beta$-shift and appears in the graph as a ray to $\infty$. 

Motivation: For the sake of concreteness, I'll state a very particular context, but my question is a little more general. I'm trying to find a function $\gamma\colon [0,\delta) \to [0,\delta')$ that satisfies the following functional equation: $$ \gamma(y) + \gamma(y)^{1+\varepsilon} - y = \gamma(y - y^{1+\varepsilon}). $$ Here $0<\varepsilon<1$, and I'm most interested in the behaviour of $\gamma$ for very small values of $y$. I've persuaded myself that $\gamma(y) = y^{1/(1+\varepsilon)}(1+o(1))$, but I'd really like an exact solution, which I imagine would have to come in the form of a power series $\gamma(y) = \sum_n c_n y^{a_n}$. Due to the form of the equation, though, the exponents $a_n$ aren't going to be integers, and unless I'm mistaken, they won't even all be integer multiples of some fixed $a_0$, so I can't get back to "regular" power series by doing a simple change of coordinates. This motivates my question... Question: Can anyone suggest a reference on dealing with power series where the exponents take non-integer values (and are not all integer multiples of some fixed exponent)? Or suggest a paper where such power series are used (for any purpose)? Ideally I'd like to see how similar functional equations have been solved, but any references at all would be appreciated. 

For a Brownian motion $B_t$, the evolution of the moments with $t$ obeys the simple rule: $$\mathbb{E}[|B_t|^p] = \kappa_p |t|^{p/2},$$ with $\kappa_p<\infty$. The proof only requires to remark that the random variables $\frac{B_t}{\sqrt{t}}$ are Gaussian with variance 1. I am interested to know if, more generally, the question was studied for Lévy processes. Of course, in the general case, the moments can be infinite. When they are not, do we have an estimation of the evolution of $\mathbb{E}[|X_t|^p]$ for a Lévy process $X_t$, or at least some bounds? Thank you for your attention. 

I couldn't find this reference in the traditional databases, either on the website of the journal. Is it possible to find it on the internet? 

Consider a sequence of i.i.d. random variables $(X_n)_{n\geq 0}$, and set $S_N = \sum_{n=1}^N X_n$. For which $p> 0$ do we have that \begin{equation} \lim \inf \frac{|S_N|}{N^{1/p}} > 0 \text{ almost surely}? \end{equation} In [1], important results are shown for the quantity $M_N := \max_{n\leq N} |S_n|$. In particular, $\lim \inf \frac{|M_N|}{N^{1/p}}$ is almost surely $\infty$ for $p> \delta$ and almost surely $0$ for $p< \delta$, where $\delta$ is an index that is explicitly defined from the law of the $X_n$. The index $\delta$ is typically $\alpha$ for symmetric-$\alpha$-stable random variables. However, the case I am interested in is presented as "much more difficult" by William Pruitt. I would be curious by any partial results (stable laws, infinitely divisible laws). [1] Pruitt, The Growth of Random Walks and Levy Processes, 1981, Annals of Probability $URL$ 

One example from dynamical systems is the specification property, which needs 5 quantifiers. It was introduced by Rufus Bowen in the 1970s to study equilibrium measures of dynamical systems; for example, it implies that the limiting distribution of periodic orbits is the unique measure that maximizes entropy as long as the system is expansive. It comes in various versions, which are not quite all equivalent, but let me ignore these subtleties and just quote one. Given a compact metric space $X$, a continuous map $f\colon X\to X$ has the specification property if $\forall\epsilon>0$, $\exists T>0$ such that $\forall (x_1,n_1),\dots,(x_\ell,n_\ell)\in X\times \mathbb{N}$, $\exists y\in X$ such that $\forall 1\leq k\leq \ell$ and $0\leq j < n_k$, we have $d(f^{N_k + j}(y),f^j(x_k)) < \epsilon$, where $N_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} (n_i + T)$, and we also have $f^{N_\ell+n_\ell+T}(y)=y$. Roughly speaking it says that any finite collection of orbit segments can be shadowed by a periodic orbit that takes a bounded time $T$ to transition from each one to the next, and that $T$ depends only on how precise the shadowing is required to be. 

In the 60's, I. Gel'fand introduced the concept of generalized stochastic processes (Ch. III, Vol. 4 of his work on Generalized functions). For a generalized stochastic process $\Phi$, he defines the concepts of stationarity ($\Phi(\varphi)$ and $\Phi(\varphi(\cdot - t_0))$ have the same law) and of independence at every point (the random variable $\Phi(\varphi_1)$ and $\Phi(\varphi_2)$ are independent if $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ have disjoint supports). Gel'fand especially introduces the complete class of Lévy white noises as generalized stochastic processes with characteristic functional of the form $$L(\varphi) =\exp\left( \int f(\varphi(t)) \mathrm{d}t \right),$$ with $f$ a function that has a L\'evy-Khintchine representation. Obviously, white noises are not the only stationary and independent at every point processes (ex: the weak derivative of a white noise). I am interested by a characterization of stationary and independent at every point processes. Especially, Gel'fand conjectured the following result. Conjecture: If a generalized stochastic process $\Phi$ is stationary and independent at every point, then the characteristic function $L$ of $\Phi$ has the form $$L(\varphi) =\exp\left( \int f(\varphi(t),\varphi^{(1)}(t),\cdots, \varphi^{(n)}(t)) \mathrm{d}t \right),$$ with $f$ a continuous function from $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ to $\mathbb{C}$ with $f(0)=0$. Is that result true? In order to express a kind of reciprocal result, can we characterize the functions $f$ such that the previous functional is a characteristic functional (main problem: its positive-definiteness)? Some people are extensively studied the positive-definiteness of functionals but wasn't able to find references that are clearly answering my question. Thanks for your attention.
