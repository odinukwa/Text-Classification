I recommend not adding a rear brake, you should add a front brake instead, and learn to use it properly. Any standard reach front brake should work fine. If you want to have both brakes, then use the full length housing and zip ties as others have mentioned. The complete bike as specd by Surly has a front brake only. 

You should absolutely grease your seatpost (unless it is carbon fiber). It won't slip around if your seatpost clamp is properly tightened. Get a thing of grease from the bike shop, like the park tool PPL-1 grease. Better yet, get the big tub. Then, generously apply it all over inside your seattube. When you think you have enough, add some more. Then put the seatpost in and twist it around a lot and move it up and down to ensure the grease covers all of the seatposts surface. Screw threads are often greased when they are installed, but that doesn't cause them to get loose any easier. Same thing with the seatpost. 

If you don't chase when you need to, you'll have a very tough time threading the bottom bracket in, and as a result, it may creak or wear out somewhat faster than it would otherwise. The same goes for facing the bottom bracket shell. This is what I would do (and have done) if I were in your position, only for square taper, cartridge bottom brackets*: Since you are using a square taper bottom bracket, your BB will likely have one fixed and one free cup (or whatever its called). Take the free cup, and thread just that into the shell without using any tool besides the driver (example), only finger tightening it. If you can thread that all the way in until its outer flange is flush with the shell, then your frame is "good enough" as it is. Unthread the free cup, and install the BB properly and you should be good to go. If you can't get the free cup all the way in without using tools, then I would have the threads chased out. I used this method on my Surly Cross-check frame in 2007, and the threads were good enough then, and I haven't had any bottom bracket troubles whatsoever. And cough up the extra cash to get the better bottom bracket, it will last longer, and every time you have to take square taper cranks off, you wear them out much quicker. *Hollowtech and other outboard bearing systems are more sensitive to the threading, and especially the facing of the shell. If using those systems, always have the bottom bracket faced, and at that point you might as well chase out the threads. 

Forget the calipers.Just install cantilever brakes. They are compatible with STI levers. v-brakes use the same boss placement as cantis. It's too bad that all cantis seem to be lousy in my experience, but they do the job. 

The only thing that will work for everyone in all situations is to wear a heart rate monitor and ride right at your aerobic threshold. Otherwise, it will be mostly personal preference, for loose meanings of "shortest amount of time possible". 

If it's a road tire, i.e. a slick, it makes no difference. The tire direction marks are usually printed on road tires because mechanics are so used to looking for them, that the makers may as well put them on there so as not to confuse or waste the time of the installer. $URL$ 

If its "incredibly bent" then the answer is no. Replacing a tube on a typical lugged steel frame will run you a couple hundred dollars from a good frame builder. It goes up from there. 

I have found studs on the front and a regular tire on the back gets the best trade-off of speed and stability. Two studded tires is just way too slow. With a studded front, stability to avoid wiping out is there, especially in those obnoxious snowy ruts. Sometimes rear traction isn't great and your rear slips and sldes, but not often and when it does, you rarely wipe out. 

Work is force times distance. A larger wheel doesn't spin as much, but instead you have to deliver more force to turn it. There is no escaping conservation of energy. Additionally, I know you said fixed gear, but keep in mind that a multi-speed setup essentially does the same thing as you're hypothesizing about, but instead of changing wheel size it alters the torque-velocity relationship between the wheel and crank. 

The < > layout is the most common. As Jay Bazuzi pointed out, the forces on the tires aren't from the same directions. Some tires it doesn't matter, some it does. Also, road bike tires typically have essentially zero tread, and it doesn't matter which way they are mounted. They'll almost always have a "rotation ->" printed on them though, but thats really just so people don't get confused, especially mechanics that are so used to looking for those when mounting tires. Lastly, bike tires don't need tread to handle rain. 

In my opinion, roof racks are the best. They are strong, they can carry quite a lot, and they hold everything out of the way. I have a roof rack on my Mazda 6 wagon and carry bikes, skis, kayaks, and plenty of other stuff. I find it best to get a vehicle with the factory rails, then get Yakima/Thule towers and crossbars. Few sedans have factory rails, but many SUVs, vans, and wagons do. The big downside with the roof is you must make sure everything is off before you pull into the garage, unless you enjoy the crunch sounds. 

In addition to what Blam suspects, verify you don't have any debris in your rim, and that your rim tape is not damaged. If this tube was a replacement after a flat, it's possible whatever caused the previous flat remains to torment you further. 

This is not a 'legitimate' reason to avoid quick releases. Just like anything in life, there are low and high quality offerings, and there is good and bad luck. Your friend either has a low quality wheel or bad luck. The bar for quality on a BSO is pretty low, so even if his is nicer than yours, it might still not be high quality. All my wheels besides the coaster-braked wheels have QR axles. I weigh 200 pounds, beat up my bikes and I've never had one bend. This collection of bikes includes a tandem. It has QR wheels. If anything is going to put a QR axle to a test of strength, the tandem is going to be it. And it is fine. Many vendors of tandems equip their bikes with QR wheels. They're all fine. 

You can get in-line cable housing adjusters. A pair is listed on $URL$ part CAH32. I think those are made by jagwire, and they should be available at virtually any bike shop. edit: those inline adjusters are for derailleur cables only. Use this $URL$ for brake cables. It goes in the cable stop. Being a QBP product, you should also be able to obtain those at virtually any local bike shop. 

You mentioned fresh snow, but I'm going to include this as part of a general answer. The difference between fresh snow and tracked snow is huge. Tracked snow is vastly more difficult to bike in. With just a few inches of solid snow and some criss-crossing tire tracks, it can be nearly impossible to ride at any significant speed. 

A bicycle without a rider is not a machine, it is just a large paperweight or a piece of artwork. There are very few technical aspects that can be "objective" when the very machine itself has a greatly varying and subjective element inherent to it. Many of the other answers have touched on this issue, and that's that all bikes are not used exactly the same way. In one of the OP's comments, is written "If you want variable loads, then create a mechanism on the drive / cassette to create that in a repeatable way.". Well, that's not so simple, because not all bikes see the same loads. A bike ridden by a professional rider is going to see different wear than a bike ridden by a guy in a minnesota winter commuting to work. The moment you build a machine to test your cassetes, you've already decided what "optimum" means, and that won't cover everyone. Trying to test every method with every substance with every riding condition with every maintenance schedule to figure out what's best in all circumstances is completely impractical. Jahaziel gave the example of someone lubing his chain with animal fat. That very well could truly be optimal for that person's situation. How can optimal involve something that is unavailable or too expensive, for anyone, for anything? The New Horizons probe was designed to perform a very specific function under very specific conditions in a very specific timeframe. In contrast, part of the beauty of the bicycle, is that it can be used for so many different purposes. 

The two freewheels being engaged in opposite directions would result in only a single freewheel being engaged at a time. He wouldn't be able to 'change' gears, going forward, but would see a different torque profile when slowing down compared to when going forward. 

Ignoring the dropout width and axle size, absolutely. The rear wheel supports far more weight than front wheels, so using a rear wheel up front will be perfectly fine, albeit funny looking. 

The safety bicycle had some initial problems of its own too, it began with a treadle bicycle, prior to the inclusion of the chain drive. Additionally, the idea of "triangles" and their use as structural members isn't as old as you might think. Sure, people have known for a long time that triangles are 'strong', but our analytical and mathematical knowledge of them is only since the middle 17th century. So the bottom line: people rode penny farthings because the modern bicycle wasn't invented yet. 

I have a salsa Fargo, with the tubus duo and logo racks. The cargo appears to be a more basic logo, so you should be fine for the rear. The fargo's caliper mounts are inside the rear triangle, and the bike is designed to be a touring bike. With the duo, you will sacrifice using the fork mounted bottle cage mounts. Its most likely the same for the Tara. That upper loop on the Tara may interfere with a 29er, but I have no first hand experience. 

Put the chain around the big-big gears without threading it through the derailleur. Have the chain overlap by one link. Now with that length thread it through the derailleur. $URL$ 

As an experienced cyclist with a lot of tandem experience: you are way over thinking this whole thing. Assuming both of you are adults and not complete klutzes, you'll have it figured out well enough in a few minutes of trial and error. If you're not both adults, you'll still figure out within a few extra minutes. Getting to be real slick starting and stopping instantly takes awhile to develop as a team, but just getting going is pretty easy. As andy256 said, the captain can ride around on it for 30 seconds to get a feel for it, then add the stoker. Two of your comments to address: 

Ebay and craigslist, and maybe amazon is pretty much it. Otherwise you can try bikeforums or mtbr for sale subforums in addition to local shops. 

Rather than quoting figures for the right and left flange distances from the Locknut centerline distance, they quote a "flange to flange" distance, along with an offset, for some mysterious reason. This image: $URL$ should help translate their "Flange to Flange" and offset figures to be right and left flange distances. In the case of this hub, your left and right flange distances are: 

You can get some spacers, but you wouldn't be able to safely put much weight on it. Probably not much more weight than you could using a seatpost mounted rack. You're pretty much out of luck. What the LBS guys said is correct concerning most disc braked bikes. There are bicycles that have disc brakes that are intended to have racks. For example, I have a salsa fargo, which is such a bike. However, the Fargo, and other similar bikes, mount the disc brake caliper in the rear triangle. 

2nd, ditch the flywheel. An automotive alternator isn't "powered by a flywheel", it's connected to the peripheral belt, and spins at the same RPM as the engine, and is quite content with variable engine speeds. The purpose of the engine's flywheel is because for an ICE, the power generation phase is a very small intermittent portion of the total cycle, and so the flywheel smooths that out a bit. In cycling, your legs can provide a more constant power input. There is no benefit to the flywheel as that is just additional mass the rider will need to accelerate. When it comes to energy, there is no free lunch and any energy in the flywheel has to be put there by the rider. Unless you are able to efficiently extract energy from the coasting flywheel (you won't), it will present a net loss of conversion efficiency. Bicycling, and human beings in general, are a terrible source of energy. Most people without significant training will struggle to even momentarily provide 100W, fewer still will be able to sustain it for more than 5 or 10 seconds. 

That chain connector is not only for single speed, but I believe it is for 1/8" chains as well, so you may have a track chain, which is not meant for multi-speed drivetrains. If it's not an 1/8" chain, and is instead a 3/32" chain, and your drive train is 8 speed or less, you can just replace the master link and you should be good to go. The master links only cost a few dollars so it can be a lot cheaper than swapping out the whole chain. Master links for multi speed chains look more like this: 

It is not necessarily "good" for your workout. If you drop into the 'easy' gear, you obviously have to pedal faster to maintain your speed. Going at a slower cadence in a higher gear will just trash your knees after awhile. Select the gear that yields a similar cadence as when you are riding on the flats, while maintaining a similar energy expenditure. Your chain rubbing problems should be solved by adjusting your derailuer and properly maintaining your bike. 

Their main problem is your first bullet hypothesis: They can't cope as well with sustained braking on descent, as that is where brakes are challenged the hardest. Even with the extra cooling fins, on a long descent, the brake may overheat, and may catastrophically fail. Riders using roller brakes have reported the brakes getting hot enough to ignite the internal lubricants inside the hub when making descents on tandems or loaded bikes. Even if you had cooling fins the size of the wheel, you are generating heat inside the hub, and that heat has to travel out to the fins, which is surprisingly slow. Going down a mountain, you theoretically could have your hub start on fire, while the outer parts of the cooling fins could be cool to the touch. Disc brakes don't have that as the source of the energy is at the caliper which is on the outside of the rotors, but even then those have failed from overheating too. The weight aspect on its own isn't too big a deal, even with heavy loads, you can only slow down so much before you are completely stopped. However, when descending, you can drag the brakes and build up heat faster than it can be dissipated, and combining a descent with a heavy load doubles the demands on the brakes. Ultimately, every bicycle brake system turns kinetic energy into heat, and has a maximum wattage it can operate at continuously. What increases the wattage is greater deceleration or greater loads. If you were touring across Iowa, you'd be totally fine. Japan is pretty mountainous. If you are going to only be traveling where the terrain is pretty gentle, you'd probably be OK. If you are going into the mountains though, you'll want a different brake system.
