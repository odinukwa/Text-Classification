A high density of stars definitely increases the chances of collisions, however, the high velocity of a halo star orbiting wouldn't increase its chances. Since the halo star is traveling very quickly, the halo star would only spend a small amount of time near the galactic core. Additionally, it would have less time to get deflected, gravitationally, by other stars in the core. 

This is a spectral energy distribution (SED). Since astronomical objects don't emit light a single frequency an SED tells you how much emission you're getting across a range of frequencies. 

You're right, a redshift will give you a measure of a velocity, not an acceleration. I'm assuming when you say acceleration, you're referring to the accelerating expansion of the universe so you're not looking at the particular acceleration of an object (which you could get from examining the force of gravity imparted on that object). So in addition to a redshift, you need to find a way to independently measure the distance. To get out to an appreciable redshift (z~0.5), Type Ia supernova are used as "standard candles". They are considered standard because they're believed to be from white dwarfs that explode because they have reached their maximum possible mass, the Chandrasekhar limit, of 1.4 solar masses. Therefore, when they explode, they should all look about the same and any difference in brightness would be from how far they are away from us. So they measured the distance and the redshift of the galaxy the supernova originated from to determine the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating over time. 

We observe the temperature of the CMB as a ~2.7 K blackbody, but that's the redshifted version we observe. The CMB is also know as the "surface of last scattering" at the point of recombination when nuclei and electrons combined to form neutral atoms the universe went from opaque to transparent. This happens at a temperature of ~3000 K. From this we can estimate the redshift (z~1100) of the CMB which corresponds to an age given our cosmology. 

Stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes likely form from very different mechanisms. While we have a pretty good idea how stellar mass black holes form, we're still not sure about how supermassive black holes form because they occur very early on in the Universe. 

Using the Earth-Moon distance and the separation of the Moon from the Sun in the sky when the Moon was at exactly half-phase, Aristarchus calculated the Earth-Sun distance. 

Incorrect. Even if the Earth had no axial tilt and the Moon had an equatorial orbit, that doesn't mean that every new moon would be a total solar eclipse. Yes, the moon would always generate some kind of an eclipse at every new moon, but it's orbit shape hasn't changed -- it's still an ellipse. It's further at some points in its orbit and closer at others. When it's further away at new moon, it appears smaller than the sun in the sky, making an annular (ring) eclipse, not a total eclipse. 

Over the course of an entire year, about 365 days and 6 hours, these 3 minutes and 56 seconds adds up to an entire day, so that exactly one year later, the same star will pass through the meridian at the same time of day. For Arcturus to pass the meridian exactly 22 hours earlier, it should be 22/24 of a year before then, or about 335 days later, or about 30 days earlier, or March 29. 

Basically, Huygens used good methods, except for using "numerology and mysticism" to determine the size of Venus. He was lucky that Venus was almost the size of Earth; that made his estimate for the AU pretty close. Not long after, Cassini used the parallax of Mars to determine the AU. (Same article as linked above.) 

You just found the difference between the sidereal year and the tropical year, and that was no coincidence. Addition The number of sidereal months in a sidereal year is one more than the number of synodic months in a sidereal year. That is because the Earth goes around the Sun once of year (of course), leading to one less synodic month than sidereal month. Here, $P_{syn}$ is the synodic period and $P_{sid}$ is the sidereal period, and $Y_{sid}$ is the sidereal year, all in days. $$\frac{Y_{sid}}{P_{sid}} = \frac{Y_{sid}}{P_{syn}} + 1$$ Dividing both sides by $Y_{sid}$ yields: $$\frac{1}{P_{sid}} = \frac{1}{P_{syn}} + \frac{1}{Y_{sid}}$$ Solving for $Y_{sid}$... $$\frac{1}{P_{sid}} - \frac{1}{P_{syn}} = \frac{1}{Y_{sid}}$$ or $$P_{sid}^{-1} - P_{syn}^{-1} = \frac{1}{Y_{sid}}$$ Multiplying both sides by $Y_{sid}$ and dividing both sides by $P_{sid}^{-1} - P_{syn}^{-1}$ yields $$Y_{sid} = \frac{1}{P_{sid}^{-1} - P_{syn}^{-1}}$$ 

For starbursts, their star formation rates are best estimated by a combination of their ultraviolet and infrared emission. [O II] and [O III] as well as Hydrogen recombination lines can be used to estimate star formation, but like the UV, these suffer from extinction. 

Schindler et al. 1999: Morphology of the Virgo Cluster: Gas versus Galaxies has details for $\beta$ model fits for Virgo and its subclusters. 

However, when you burn the Hydrogen in the shell to Helium, it will fall on the core creating a hotter core where the radiation pressure from the Helium burning core will push the Hydrogen further out into the outer envelope. From here you can get a Helium flash which is the cause of Horizontal Branch stars. If you were able to somehow force more Hydrogen to shell burn then you could possibly extend the life for a short while, though the lifetimes post main sequence are much shorter < 1 Gyr compared to the lifetimes on the main sequence. 

Since basically all metals come from some stellar process, the question of elemental distribution can vary greatly between different environments depending on when you're observing that particular galaxy, star/galaxy cluster, etc. Galaxy mergers, supernova, and stellar winds can be particularly good at moving metals around a galaxy or galaxy cluster. Interestingly Wolfram has element data with Universe abundances but I'm not sure where they derive those. 

The mass luminosity relation is non-linear (L = M^3.5 for the main sequence) so more massive stars burn at a much faster rate. This is a non-linear relationship because the fusion is caused by pressure in the core from the star trying to gravitationally collapse on itself. 

Black holes are created because the core of the star becomes very dense, not just because the star is massive. Prior to the creation of the black hole, the core is able to create enough outward pressure to prevent the core from gravitationally collapsing to the density needing to create a black hole. 

HUDF suffers from cosmic variance. So while you could choose what you believe is a random and unbiased region of sky, your uncertainty will be larger than just the standard statistical sampling error. There would be additional uncertainty because of large scale structure since galaxies are not randomly distributed on the sky. 

Again, because of the elliptical orbit of the Moon, the length of totality or annularity still can vary. Even during a single eclipse, the length of totality depends on your exact location on Earth. Your exact location determines your exact distance from the moon during the eclipse, which will vary depending on whether the Moon is getting closer/farther and how fast. There are formulas for calculating this, but I'm sure they are quite complicated even with the moon orbiting over the equator and with Earth having no axial tilt. 

But then there was the transit of 1769. Observations in Norway and in the Hudson Bay were made for the northern observations, and Captain James Cook was sent to what is now Tahiti to make a southerly observation. Jérôme Lalande compiled the figures and calculated a solar parallax of 8.6 arc-seconds, close to the modern figure of about 8.794 arc-seconds. That calculation yielded the first fairly accurate calculation of the Earth-Sun distance, of 24,000 Earth radii, which given the Earth's radius of 6,371 km, about 153,000,000 km, the accepted value being about 149,600,000 km. 

With respect to the Sun, the Earth rotates once every 24 hours. But because the Sun's apparent position changes in the sky due to Earth's revolution around the Sun, the Earth rotates once every 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds with respect to the stars. Because of this 3 minutes, 56 seconds difference, all stars rise and set 3 minutes, 56 seconds earlier each succeeding day. This applies to the time of a star passing through the meridian as well. So, on the next day, April 29, Arcturus will pass the meridian at 22:56:04. 

They could time the transit, which would last hours, with great precision. But they had to wait until the next transit of Venus in 1761. Then, observers observed the black drop effect, which made it very hard to time the event from start to finish precisely. 

For the same reason as (1), the path of totality would vary from a maximum amount down to nothing. For annular eclipses there would be a similar path of annularity instead. But whichever path it is would always be centered on the equator. 

Generally, the closer you are to the equator, the more the sun would be covered. But this would vary slightly depending on the distance of the Moon from the Earth, and it wouldn't depend solely on your latitude. As Gerald points out, the moon's shadow, in which you would see a total solar eclipse, is cone-shaped. Different points on the Earth close to the equator would experience a different cross-section of the cone, which may be narrower or wider depending on your exact location. Where the eclipse is partial, the apparent size of the moon would control how much of the Sun is covered. A further-away moon would appear smaller in the sky and thus cover less of the Sun. Close to the borderline where the Moon appears to graze the Sun, the Moon may miss the Sun entirely if it's far enough and it appears small enough. 

The sidereal year is 6 hours and 9 minutes longer than a 365 day calendar year. To simplify your question, assuming you an your friend were born on the same date and time in 1983 and 1984 you would be 365 days, 6 hours, and 9 minutes older than your friend. Since there is no leap day between the two times you are considering, it doesn't affect the calculation. 

Aladin is a good way to do visualization from multiple catalogs. MAST also offers a cross-mission search. 

Use the Optical Spectra Query Form. You'll want to set PRIMTARGET to "GALAXY". Here's the list of possible parameters it can return $URL$ Note, there is a query limit of 500,000 rows, so you'll have to break up the query since you'll have more spectra than that. 

When stars transition from the main sequence core Hydrogen burning to core Helium burning they can experience Hydrogen shell burning. 

All of these effects are related to the 11 year solar cycle. And while we know there are times when the sun is "active" versus "inactive" we aren't necessarily predicting exactly where sunspots or solar flares will occur, but how many we see in total. 

The local environment is very important to star formation because it requires material as well as something to perturb the nebula to start collapsing and forming star(s). Therefore, both the type of galaxy as well as the location in the galaxy are very important to creating stars. However, once a star moves from protostar onto the main sequence, external influences don't much affect its development. This is how we can identify stellar streams because the stars come from a similar population when they are created, but some tidal forces cause them to spread out around the galaxy. 

There is a Dantes Standardized Subjet Test (DSST) in astronomy. I have no idea if and how widely colleges give credit for these exams. Typically, you will start with physics and choose to specialize in astronomy. Therefore, most standardized exams are for physics which may have a handful of astronomy questions. 

I believe your confusion is from combining two popular simplifications of our Universe. As we look further away we see further back in time because of the finite speed of light. So these distant objects are also evolving with us, but that light hasn't hit Earth yet. It might help to know that the observable universe may only be 14 Gyr old, but its radius is 46 Gly, not 14 Gly. If the speed of light was infinite, then we wouldn't be observing back in time as we look at more distant objects.
