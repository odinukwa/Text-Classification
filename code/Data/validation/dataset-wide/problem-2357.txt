White outdoor gear is going to get dirty. Wear it as a point of pride it has done more than just sit in your closet ;) Dyneema(tm) is reportedly bleach safe. In general, bleach is pretty safe on any non-organic material. Bleach works by breaking down organics (which is why cotton shirts/socks tend to get thinner over time.) If your stitching is organic (cotton, wool, etc) bleach could weaken them over time. 

*Sidebar: If you can find a pair of the button-hole locks that don't rely on friction, get them! They will never fail unexpectedly. 

It is a rare day that I head out into the winter wilds without a flask of sumpt'n-sumpt'n in my pocket. A nip helps one to relax, can mildly embolden timid skiers in my group, and gives one that fiery radiating warmth upon imbibing. Its this latter I am curious about: Does whiskey (or other spirits) actually have warming benefits? Or is it just psychological? 

If the question is whether double-socking is better, that is unanswerable and totally a question of personal preference. If 2 socks work for you, and reduce blisters, go for it. For other people's feet / shoes, 1 sock may be better. I've even worn 3 socks when my shoes were big enough, and I have hiked with people who wore no socks without issue... If the question is whether two socks are proven to reduce friction - even that depends on the fabric of the socks, the material and fit of the boot, the foot, and the environment (hot, cold, wet, dry, etc...). 

Ultimately, it is a matter of personal preference, but I always encourage people to pack it inside -- and insist they do when borrowing my gear. PROTIP: When forced to pack something outside (ie, external frame, or carrying too much stuff) always use closed loop tie-downs that are threaded through a closed loop on both your pack and your gear. That way, if the gear slides off without noticing, it will still be chained to your pack. 

Assuming the cat-hole is the preferred protocol for waste disposal in the area you are backpacking, what should you do when the soil is buried below A LOT of snow, and/or frozen? 

As a final note, this is not to advocate NOT drinking water while hiking, since Dehydration is just as bad and far more common. Be smart. Drink what you need, but not more. Be aware of what you body is doing. 

Carry a small sheet of plastic, burlap, or a section of an old fire shelter, or anything of the like (it shouldn't get hot enough to burn if your mound is constructed properly, though embers might land on the edges) Find a previously-disturbed source of mineral soil (a downed tree root ball, a sandbar in a creek, etc.) near your camp Lay the sheet out on a level bit of ground (rock/bare soil preferred but not necessary) Make a flat "mound" of mineral soil 3-5 inches thick on the sheet, making it a bit wider than your expected fire Build a small twiggy fire on top of the mound When finished, scatter the ashes charcoal twigs (or pack out if required) Return the mineral soil back to its source 

Addendum: Being "defensive" also means being prepared if all goes south in a hurry. Have water, or a bucket of sand/non-organic soil nearby to help stop spot fires if it escapes your ring. A proper tool (shovel) should be on hand if car camping. 

Granted, the last 3 might not be the best idea on your fancy teflon-coated pots (but why are you using those anyway? Meet my old friend stainless steel) Note: the omission of 'soap' is not accidental. Bonus tip: Coffee grounds do a mean number on bacon grease. An addendum regarding soap: NEVER use directly in a body of water / creek. Even "biodegradable" soap needs the enzymes found in soil to break down. Wash dishes (and you) well away from any water source. (Unless on a major river where 'dilution is the solution to pollution') 

Post-holing has very real risks due to the simple fact you have no idea what lies beneath the surface of the snow until you punch through and bang, scrape or wedge your leg under, against, between or in a hidden tree, log, rock, hole, creek, etc. Some of the risks: 

In the absence of water, smothering with soil and thoroughly mixing the embers with the soil will effectively put out a camp fire. A fire needs: fuel, heat, oxygen. By mixing in soil you remove two of those. A fire is only out when you can run your hands through the soil and not feel any heat. 

Having not seen my chin for 15 years, here are a few thoughts on the practical aspects (assuming one is personally equally comfortable with a beard as without): Pros: 

Telemark -- where the toe is attached, and the heel is free to rise up and down -- allow skiers to skin up back-country slopes with a more natural and efficient stride. However, AT (or randonee) rigs allow skiers that ability while doing alpine turns on the way down. So, in this day and age, why do people still Telemark: 

From personal experience, these are the relative advantages / disadvantages I have discovered personally or witnessed first hand: Ole' Blue: - The lovable, closed-cell foam pad. 

Inflatable pillows blow. (Get it? Ha ha! I kill me.) Seriously though - after years of battling inflatables (sticky in hot climes, slippery, hard to breathe when you are face down in them) I've found the most comfy pillow is a fleece jacket rolled loosely in a pillow case. You presumably have extra clothes with you - roll em in there too. For extra comfy - a down vest works nice. A down vest rolled around a fleece jacket is kingly. 

In addition to @Pearsonartphoto's technical specs, it is important to remember that a Sat Phone is one tool at your disposal, and not a replacement for smart decision making, or proper planning. I have seen them provide people with a false sense of security thinking it gives added insurance against making bad decisions. Like any electronic equipment, sat phones depend on batteries (which don't last all that long), must be kept dry, and can not be depended upon. (Ie, assume it will be broken / dead when you need it.) I have been required to use sat phones extensively in the back-country as part of my work responsibilities - in both the mountains and canyon country - and they have proved extremely useful, if frustrating. Getting a signal can be challenging and talk time is short (as satellites whizz by above) possibly to the point of miscommunication: ("Hi honey - I'm ....." "Oh my! what's wrong? Did she break her leg? Why was she cut off?!? Panic!") All that being said, having a sat phone saved at least one life I was responsible for. 

Bonus Protip: Battery acid can be removed with a solution of baking soda and water. Soak the encrusted item in this (with battery removed) then allow to dry thoroughly before re-applying electricity. (Note -- might not be a good idea with higher-tech devices.) 

Getting it out of site (and other feet) Keeping it from running off Keeping it near the layer of organic soil 

What I have found works best (especially with light rope/cord) is to spool the cord in "figure 8s" between two fingers, wrists or arms: Hold one end in your hand in front of you then sweep under the running end with the other hand and lift up so the running end drapes over the top of your hand and away from center. Sweep under with the first hand and lift up so the running end again drapes over the top and away. The cord will make an X between your hands. Repeat. Use the remaining end to wrap tightly around the X and tuck the end in. This method keeps the coils separate, and does not introduce any twists in the rope. This has virtually eliminated tangles from my life in everything from climbing rope to dental floss. A diagram would help but I'm thumbing this out on a DumbPhone so that will have to wait. 

Taking the lead from MrWizard, I did a little look for what the boys and girls in white lab-coats say. In addition to the evidence presented at Snopes.com and the experts at the Ketchup Advisory Board (see MrWizard's answer) a few interesting articles (see below) all seem to point to this conclusion: Commercially produced mayonnaise made with acetic acid is safe and due to its low pH, as well as the salt, and other additives it contains. That, combined with the fact that none of the outdoor experts here have ever had mayo go bad on them... well, draw your own conclusions. 

BAM! Absolutely no trace of your fire, except maybe flattened vegetation where the was. The mineral soil mound insulates the ground so grass underneath is unharmed. For areas that don't have available mineral soil (slick rock?), you might consider a small fire-pan (think disposable aluminum turkey roasting pan) to minimize char/scar from the fire. For more info, check out Leave No Trace principle 5. 

Your mileage will vary by manufacturer, tent technology might not change, but designs do quite a lot (just to keep you wanting the next thing...) Check out REI - they have a 100% full return or replacement guarantee on all purchases that extends pretty much for eternity. I demand a lot of my gear, and even when it has let me down, REI never has. 

Sounds to me like you should spray in on evenly almost to the point of saturation, and remove any excess... (excess is usually the result of over-saturation). I suspect there is not any hard-and-fast rule, otherwise I imagine they would be more specific. I'm a fan of more-is-better approach (... to life). If you use too little, you'll probably notice next time you wear the thing. 

The surest way to find out is put in on and go hike in a rainstorm for X hours. Carry a spare in case it fails. 

Yes. Lots of farms rent llamas. Most require at minimum a 1/2 day "orientation" course in how to handle a llama. This includes things like the care and feeding of the animal, as well as how to pack the animal properly to keep the load manageable and balanced. An overnight with a handler would be more than sufficient to give you the skills you need. Llamas are more suited for 'novice' packers than a horse. Mostly, if a llama does get a wild hair and freak out, it won't kill you (but it still might run off with your tent.) IS llama packing "too good to be true"? Pros: 

My point is this: if you have a waterproof floor on your tent, you don't need any footprint. The trouble is, you are subjecting your tent floor to the abuses of rocks, sticks, sea-shells, brambles, or whatnot - meaning it will quickly get micro-tears and perforations. Enter the footprint: a cheaper, replaceable protector for your tent floor. Thus, you want to put it OUTSIDE to protect the floor of your tent, which is (or should be) waterproof already. The footprint itself is usually waterproof (and in fact. some tents can be set up with just to footprint and the rain-fly as an ultra-light body-less option.) Now, if both your footprint AND your tent have lots of wear and holes, then neither will help much (even together) in a deluge. Sure, ANOTHER footprint inside would help (assuming it is structurally sound) but if you need it, you might re-consider how your floor got to this state of disrepair in the first place, and re-adjust accordingly.

Some of you may remember 35mm film** and the black cases it came in. I have a few lying around, and have seen people use them as backpacking salt and pepper shakers. I have also heard that's a good way to poison yourself slowly with nasty chemicals... Good idea or bad? ** (Film cameras were a kind of "digital camera" that "printed" the pictures directly on "film" in the camera that had to be "developed") 

I assume by hat you mean mean a full-brim hat, while by cap you are referring to a baseball cap (brim in front only)? Regardeless, in all instances of hiking anywhere with intense sun, your best bet will be: a hat The wider the brim the better, to keep the sun off your neck, ears, nose and shoulders. For sunny, arid regions: consider a thin airy straw-type hat that allows good circulation around your head while providing sun protection. The straw will often hold water fairly well, and that along with a sweat band tied around it is great for evaporative cooling: Soak and repeat for a personal air conditioner. Tighter weave, treated, or gore-tex full brim hats are great for rainy regions, keeping the water out of your eyes and off your neck. 

I've heard various rumors that dogs might help keep bears away, or might be a bear attractant. Is there anything more concrete than anecdotal evidence to go on? From the companionship end, they are a net positive, helping to calm your nerves when you hear a strange noise (though it can be disturbing when they start growling at some unseen / unheard shadow in the night). 

Given that it will be your first time, no amount of preparing on a fake hill, will turn you into a snow-shredding powder dog. Your first days on a mountain WILL be difficult, painful, and short. But that doesn't mean it can't be fun. Also, consider there are so many different types of snow one encounters on a real mountain that invariably it will take some re-learning of what you thought you learned on the rug anyway. Hard-pack is a whole different animal from powder, ice, slush, or anything in between. Rather than waste your money on fake skiing, you might do better to spend your weeks before your trip doing leg and cardio exercises: wall-sits, squats, plyometrics, and good old-fashioned jogging. Then, take a lesson when you get to the ski hill. Provided you have a good attitude and are in good physical condition, you should be feeling pretty comfortable on your sticks by the end of the first day, and tackling some more spicy runs within 3 days. All that being said, learning the basic mechanics on a dry slope probably can't hurt. 

Skiing is a full-body, high endurance, activity. Being in good cardio-vascular shape is important, and can be achieved through running, swimming, rowing, etc... This can not be over-emphasized. Get your heart in shape. Assuming you already are in decent shape, here are some exercises that will help you get through those initial days on the hill. I've chosen exercises that require no additional weight -- your body and gravity provide all the resistance you need. (Some can be enhanced by holding light weights if so desired.) --Leg Strengthening-- Wall squats: Sit with your back against a wall, your feet together on the ground, and your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. Hold for increasing amounts of time. As strength increases, raise one leg at a time horizontal out in front of you. Repeating multiple reps of 30 seconds to a minute. Feel the burn. Lunges: Take a large step, dropping your back knee to the ground while bending your front knee (try to keep the front knee at a 90 degree angle). Return to standing, repeat for other leg forward. Do 50 steps or more. One legged speed squats: Stand with 90% weight on one leg, and 10% on the other. Squat down and stand up as rapidly as you feel comfortable for 20-40 reps. Repeat other side. Plyometrics: If you are already in good general shape, plyometrics will amp up your legs into bomber ski shape**. Simple moves like:
