Over the years I've heard explanations from a variety of sources, including a television documentary, that elephants have "generational memory" where the off-spring inherit certain memories of their mothers. The following two paragraphs below (relevant text emphasized to save your time) address this as well as the idea that new traits, such as specifically switching to a nocturnal lifestyle (in this case, to avoid a hunter), can be passed on to the next generation: 

A variety of anti-aging products are advertised as solution to reverse [the perceived problem of] the appearance of aging. Many claims are made about these products, often showing "before vs. after" photographs and sometimes also flaunting testimonials (unverified anecdotes), but I've not encountered references for credible studies that back up the claims (even though the phrases "clinically proven" or "clinical trials" are sometimes used). Here are a few examples (the third one is an anecdote/sales-pitch that recommends combining the first two products for best results; I also omitted tracking codes from all links to help maintain privacy): 

To answer your first question, probably not -- aside from a possible placebo effect, those solutions will very likely be ineffective due to extreme dilution in water or alcohol. To answer your second question, a diagnosis is needed to know exactly what your problem is (since pain can have a wide variety of different causes, including a physical injury, an abnormal growth putting pressure on something, a nervous system issue, a birth defect, a disease, etc.) before the results of any treatment can be estimated (and a qualified Doctor should probably be involved in the diagnosis as well as the prescription of any medicines). In essence, it appears that Homeopathy is quackery:   QuackWatch - Homeopathy: The Ultimate Fake   $URL$ The following text is a short quote from the above document (which contains 17 good references, all listed together near the end) in which I've highlighted a few items of particular interest: 

You are asking three different things, and I think that is the cause of the confusion here. "As good as new" is something quite different from "safe", and still different from whether replacing the tire it is a good idea. 

These findings together with an overall increase of early failing machines hint that the proportions of cheaper vs. more expensive machines may have changed as well. And last but not least, the study says that the age of laundry machines when arriving at the recycling facilities has decreased, but they cannot say whether/how much can be attributed to 

Conclusion of this search: long distance drivers certainly prefer diesel (the < 5 year olds). Nowadays, gasoline cars can reach the same mileage of several 100.000 km (inspecting the higher mileages of the < 5 and 5 - 10 year old cars - disregarding > 999.999 km, as one needs to carefully look for typos that add a digit and obviously meaningless mileages like the 999999). 

First of all, unfortunately, I don't have scientific papers or statistics about this (I found statistics on age, on mileage and on % diesels, but not age and mileage wrt. diesel or gasoline) - and googling isn't very effective because tons of non-scientific stuff comes up. But I hope I can contribute a few hints of evidence, and I want to point out a number of confounding factors which have a large influence on the lifetime of an engine. And one important consideration is what "more freqently" means. Per 100.000 km? Per year (difficult for new cars)? Per engine (i.e. which percentage of engines "dies" by engine failure - in my experience: very few of both sorts)? Summary: a search on car sales pages indicates that gasoline cars can reach a mileage of several 100.000 km nowadays, like diesel cars. Though (at least here in Germany) diesel cars are preferred by the long distance drivers. While such preference is probably not only based on expected lifetime, and that may have a lag from the long-lasting reputation of the diesel even if this is not true any longer, it also isn't evidence in favour of diesels being dramatically worse than gasoline engines. Long version: I came across two more newspaper articles in German language with claims roughly along the cited one: 

In the above pictured partial sample banknote, the letter code "S" means that Banca d'Italia (Italy's central bank) commissioned the printing; for Greece, there would be a letter "Y" instead. I've included the complete list of country codes (which shouldn't be confused with the ISO's list of official international country codes), which is also included on that web page, here for your convenience: 

The full details of this information is available from Statistics Canada, which is an official federal department of the Canadian Government:   Immigration in Canada: A Portrait of the Foreign-born Population, 2006 Census:   Immigration: Driver of population growth   Proportion of foreign-born highest in 75 years   $URL$ The Canadian Government conducts a "Census" regularly, which Canadians are required by law to answer fully and truthfully. The information is assumed to be accurate, and the questionnaire is short and easy to understand (I'm Canadian, and I just filled one out recently after receiving it in the mail). That information I just quoted is based on official Census data. 

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms does apply to government hiring practices (as it applies to everyone). What you discovered is not a violation of the Charter as long as this activity of hiring has as its objective "amelioration" [as outlined in the Charter].   Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms   $URL$   (Note: Any web site within the .gc.ca internet domain is operated by the Government of Canada.) See section 15, subsection 2, which applies directly; for your convenience, I bolded the most relevant text from that section (which was copied directly from the above source): 

The FDA has a number of "sped up" programs for drug approval, that on the first glance seem to fit the claim (I don't have access to the full paper). 

Personal statement at the end: this type of problems is not restricted to pharmaceutical industry developing inefficient drugs - it starts much earlier: there's a whole body of literature showing that scientific research practices have lead to large numbers of false-positive findings in publications in (at least) the biomedical field. For a start, see e.g. the Nature news feature Buchen: Cancer: Missing the Mark, Nature 471, 428-432 (2011), doi:10.1038/471428a or Ioannidis' seminal paper: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False, PLoS Med 2(8): e124, 2005 or Forstmeier et al,: Detecting and avoiding likely false‐positive findings – a practical guide, Biological Reviews, 92, 4, 1941-1968, 2017 Of particular interest for this question is e.g.: Begley, C. G. & Ellis, L. M. Drug development: Raise standards for preclinical cancer research. Nature, 2012, 483, 531-533 This is Amgen, i.e. pharmaceutical industry, complaining about (lack of) reliability of scientific publications. 

However, I agree with @sklivvz that you don't need to worry too much: while we humans have not much vitamin C storage (compared to say, vitamin D)* getting a bit more and less on alternating days is not going to be a concern. And anyways, eating an additional fresh orange on those days will get you almost your whole DRI. * update: Matissek and Baltes: Lebensmittelchemie, 8th ed, Springer Spektrum lists both vitamin C and D in the 2-4 months reserve capacity (humans) category (table 3.3, p 45). They also state (p. 605) that after destruction of the cell walls, fruits undergo rapid enzymatic degradation, but do not give quantitative information on freshly prepared juices. They explain, however, that fruit juice (in particular the unfiltered varieties ("naturtrüb") usually undergo heat treatment to inactivate enzymes. 

There are many perfume companies offering products that claim to contain human pheromones, and this one has an interesting claim on its home page that attempts to convince potential customers: 

There are some sunglasses I bought back in the 1990s containing lenses that were constructed from plastic materials that blocked blue light. Although claims were made by some vendors that the lenses were made of a material called "Malenium Polycarbonate" along with claims that this material was resistent to damage that most sunglasses couldn't withstand (e.g., striking it with a hammer), when I asked around for more information about this material, every person I asked had never heard of "Malenium." When I Google for the word "Malenium" or the phrase "Malenium Polycarbonate," I get links to web sites selling sunglasses that block blue light, such as the following which makes the same claim. (Just for fun I checked Wikipedia, and it also doesn't have any information about the word or phrase I typed into Google.) The following paragraph is from the second-last paragraph of one of the web sites that Google found for me ( $URL$ ): 

Diesel engines used to be not only lower specific power but also slower max speed and lower power / car weight. This means that preferred driving style could pretty much decide the type of engine. Gasoline for "sportive" driving style (which is much more demanding on the car, lots of load-cycle changes), diesel for calm/slow driving style. The "long-lasting" was an important sales argument, aiming at people who drive a lot. This means, that those cars were more likely to end up far more in long-distance driving than gasoline cars at the time. While the question is about modern diesel engines, I think this historic situation needs to be taken into account because that is where the long-lasting reputation of the diesel comes from. Note for judging the OP's article that it was also not a "cheaper" but a "more economic if you go long distances" reputation. And it was no "cheaper repair" reputation. Meanwhile diesel car engines have much higher specific and total power. Look e.g. at the BMW N57 engines (e.g. 242 kW, 4.4 l) or the Mercedes-Benz W221 (235 kW, 4 l) Those BMW 7 series and Mercedes S class diesel cars are restricted to vmax 250 km/h, just like the gasoline ones (though these series have gasoline engines with still more power). Hints about the lifetime of modern diesel engines. 

Hypothetically, if these pheromones were powerful enough to have an immediate effect on a person so as to completely change their perception of how attractive another person is, then I strongly suspect that these products would likely be classified as dangerous (since they could be used to commit crimes of a sexual nature, etc.) by local government regulators (just like many pharmaceuticals are) with their distribution prohibited (which would consequently make it illegal to sell). So, in an attempt to answer your questions: It seems that Humans do secrete these chemicals, but I would classify the rest of the exaggerations and claims by the marketers as something along the lines of mythical. 

You can determine which country it was printed for, but not necessarily which country it was printed in. By examining one of its more important design elements, you can identify the "central bank that commissioned the printing of a banknote (but not necessarily the country of printing)" according to this web site:   ECB: Banknotes - Design elements   $URL$   (see the section entitled "Country codes" in the last quarter of the page) 

It is easy to find evidence about the danger of improper tire repair, like this. However, I did not find any statistics on the reliability of properly done repair. To add 3 more data points to the discussion: I've personally been driving 3 tires (light truck 2.8 t, vmax 110 km/h) that had been punctured (by something leaving < 1mm hole) on a parking and have been repaired. I never drove them at too low pressure. I've been driving then something between 25000 and 50000 km thereafter. I have to double-check but I think one of them is still "in service". The others meanwhile were replaced, but their "end" had nothing to do with that puncture or repair. That is 0 repair-related failures out of 3 cases, which translates to a 95% confidence interval for the true probability of a failure after properly done repair between 0 and 70%. This illustrates that 3 data points do not allow much conclusions. But they are a starting point for collecting more evidence. Last, but not least, for the third question you ask "Should I buy a new tire?", I recommend quickly calculating how much a new tire costs, and balance that againt the hours you're still going to spend on worrying about the repaired tire. Could it be that the hourly wage for your worries is very low? In that case, you may want decide to buy a new tire regardless of the technical condition of the repaired tire. 

Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any references to studies on that web site regarding any types of Pheromones -- I would like to see even one study they're relying on to back up their claim that "Animal Sex Pheromones are well documented in the animal kingdom as the force that controls all social behaviour, including mating," which is a good reason for you to be skeptical. People do have olfactory systems that help to discern smells though, and since people do exhibit a variety of natural odours (possibly influenced by a combination of genetics, state of health, diet, exercise habits, etc.), I would expect the effects to be at least somewhat selective since what is perceived as a bad smell by one person may be a good smell to another. There is an interesting paper on this that references a long list of studies, including some studies performed on rats (in particular, see the sections entitled "Human Pheromones" and "Is a Mammalian Model Applicable to Human Behavior?"):   Human Pheromones: Mammalian Olfactory, Genetic, Neuronal, Hormonal,   and Behavioral Reciprocity and, Human Sexuality (May 16, 1996)   $URL$ The first paragraph in the "Introduction" section (paragraph 3) reads:
