An investigation of which groups G must have regular orbits is in: Horoševskiĭ, M. V. "Automorphisms of finite groups." Mat. Sb. (N.S.) 93(135) (1974), 576–587, 630. (Math. USSR Sbornik 22 (1974) 4, 584–594) MR347979 DOI: 10.1070/SM1974v022n04ABEH001707 and in particular proves that every automorphism of a nilpotent group or a semisimple (that is, Fitting-free) group has a regular orbit. The paper has exercise 3A.8 as a remark after corollary 1 (page 592 in the English translation), and corollary 3.3 as theorem 2. Its lemma 4 fixes my difficulties with dealing with the orbits prime by prime (don't look at the p-parts of A where the obvious statement has obvious counterexamples, look at non-faithful orbits instead). 

The Kruskal-Katona inequality: $$|\partial{\cal F}| \ge {{m_k} \choose {k-1}} + {{m_{k-1}} \choose {k-2}}+ \cdots + {{m_j} \choose {j-1}}.$$ Here ${\cal F}$ is a family of $k$-sets, and $\partial {\cal F}$ is its shadow, namely all sets of size $(k-1)$ contained by some set in $\cal F$. And, $$|{\cal F}|=m= {{m_k} \choose {k}} + {{m_{k-1}} \choose {k-1}}+ \cdots + {{m_j} \choose {j}},$$ where $m_k > m_{k-1} >\cdots > m_j \ge j >0$. 

Maybe the fact that most point of the sphere are very close to the equator (concentration of measure) gives some conceptual explanation. 

BabAba = 1, where Bb=1 and Aa=1. SL(2,Z) does contain free subgroups, for instance on [1,2;0,1] and [1,0;2,1], so there is no reason it could not contain free subgroups, it just so happens that {a,b} does not generate one. Of course {a,b} generates SL(2,Z) since S4=aBa and S6=Ab. 

Cholesky update Rank one updates, chol(A) to chol(A+xx*), are easy and safe. Rank one "downdates", chol(A) to chol(A-xx*), are easy but require a little care: stable algorithms are given in Stewart's Matrix Algorithms Vol 1, Algorithm 4.3.8, p. 347. Chapter 12.5 of Golub–Van Loan has some similar stuff, and Cholesky down-dating in 12.5.4. This function has been widely implemented, and the cholupdate command in matlab dates back to 1979 code from LINPACK. [0,B*;B,0] is a sum of rank one matrices, and so by updating and downdating those rank one guys, you could probably get what you want, and it might even be faster than chol(Q). However, it can be a lot better to update more ranks at a time. Apparently this is a common request in machine learning, and M. Seeger wrote a technical report on this problem of low rank updates to a Cholesky factorization, and mentions several common pitfalls, especially as regards to actually doing it with existing software. A more scholarly (and older) treatment is in section 3 of this article version of Ch. 12.5 of GvL: Gill, P. E.; Golub, G. H.; Murray, W.; Saunders, M. A. "Methods for modifying matrix factorizations." Math. Comp. 28 (1974), 505–535. MR343558 DOI:10.2307/2005923 Davis and Hager in MR1824053 note that algorithm C1 can be used for a reasonably efficient, multiple rank, single pass, update of a dense matrix (and go on to describe sparse techniques). Note that these mostly do not take advantage of the block structure of [0,B*;B,0], so you might find something better that is more specialized. 

Arrow's theorem is a basic result in social choice theory which has several simple proofs. (For three proofs see this paper: Three Brief Proofs of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem by J. Geanakoplos) It also has a few complicated proofs: The paper by Tang, Pingzhong and Lin, Fangzhen Computer-aided proofs of Arrow's and other impossibility theorems, Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009), no. 11, 1041–1053. Gives an inductive proof based on rather complicted inductive step and a computerized check for the base case. The paper by Yuliy Baryshnikov, Unifying impossibility theorems: a topological approach. Adv. in Appl. Math. 14 (1993), 404–415, gives a proof based on algebraic topology. My paper: A Fourier-theoretic perspective on the Condorcet paradox and Arrow's theorem. Adv. in Appl. Math. 29 (2002), 412–426, gives a fairly complicated Fourier-theoretic proof but only to a special case of the theorem. (A complicated proof to a related theorem is by Shelah, Saharon, On the Arrow property, Adv. in Appl. Math. 34 (2005), 217–251.) 

Intervals [A,B] in a subgroup lattice are the lattice formed from the subgroups C with A ≤ C ≤ B. An interval is a chain if it is totally ordered by inclusion. When discussing intervals in a subgroup lattice, it is often a good idea to assume we have chosen the group with this lattice minimally. In particular, we can assume G=B so that the interval goes all the way to the top, and we can assume A is core-free so that we cannot quotient out by any normal subgroup contained in every subgroup in the interval. Intervals that are chains are ubiquitous if we do not require the chain to be very long: if M is any maximal subgroup of G, then the interval [M,G] is a chain of length 1. Intervals that are very long chains are also easy to find: if G is a cyclic group of prime power order, pn, then the interval [1,G] is a chain of length n. However, these G are the only examples where the interval [1,G] is a chain. Thus the question arises if there are long chains [A,G] where 1≠A is core-free. An example for arbitrary n is the dihedral group of order 2n+1 with A any non-central subgroup of order 2. The interval [A,G] consists of the dihedral groups of order 2k for 1 ≤ k ≤ n+1, and so has length n. 

Paul, One thing you may try to do is to send a letter to the editor of Journal B appealing the decision. From your description it appears that you submitted the paper to Journal B at about the same time as the other person submitted his paper to journal A so you can mention this fact and ask that your paper will be refereed on its own merits and not be rejected just based on the appearance of the other paper. Of course, in order to be accepted your paper should be found to be correct and it is also possible that there are other distinctions between the two papers that contributed to the outcome. 

For a finite group $G$ is there a subgroup $H$ such that for every chief factor $K/L$ of $G$ one has: 

One very nice thing about Isaacs's FGT is how it exposes you to important techniques. It does not try to "optimize" the presentation either by using the bare minimum of tools or by using the most general tool here-to-fore created. It just uses some nice results in a realistic way that more people should know. Suzuki's textbooks also have this nice property, though they are not as easy to quote from. 

Fisher's inequality $$b \ge v.$$ Asserts that the number of blocks in every 2-design is at least the number of elements. A design is a collection of $k$-elements subsets (called blocks) of a set $V$ with $v$ elements such that every pair of elements of $V$ belong to the same number of blocks. This fundamental relation is closely related to the Erdos-DeBruijn theorem in extremal combinatorics, and the linear theoretic proof by Bose is an important starting point for linear algebra methods in combinatorics. 

The paper of Cooper and Thurston: Triangulating 3-manifolds using five vertex link types. Topology 27 (1988), no. 1, 23--25, is relevant. From the review: "It is known that, for any dimension n, there is a finite set of link types such that every n-manifold has a triangulation in which the link of each vertex is in this set." This does not answer the specific question, and also does not deal the case of cubed-manifolds but it can be a good place to start. 

I don't know of a resource with such a list, though you could easily make one with programs such as GAP or Magma. Since it is reasonably easy and interesting to analyze this problem, I'll outline how I suggest thinking about the examples: Let ⟨a⟩ act on the normal subgroup ⟨b⟩ in the semi-direct product ⟨a,b⟩. Then z = aibj is in the center of ⟨a,b⟩ if and only if it commutes with both a and b. Just writing it out you get a⋅(aibj) = ai+1bj and (aibj)⋅a = ai+1(bj)a, so bj has to be centralized by a. Similarly to commute with b, b has to be centralized by ai. You could try to use this in two directions: make ⟨a⟩ centralize part of ⟨b⟩, or let the kernel of the action of ⟨a⟩ on ⟨b⟩ be non-trivial (and proper). The first direction runs into some trouble, but does let you produce pretty obvious examples. As a concrete family, consider: 

This relation is true for every family F and every p. It is especially famous and simple when $p=1/2$ and $\mu_p(F)=1/2$. In this case, it says that given a set of half the vertices of the discrete cube $2^X$, the number of edges between F and its complement is at least $2^{n-1}$. The Problem A family F of subsets of $2^X$ is monotone increasing if when S belongs to F and T contains S then T also belongs to F. (Monotone increasing families also also called "filtes" and "up-families".) From now on we will restrict our attention to the case of monotone increasing families. We say that a family is optimal for $\mu_p$ if the isoperimetric inequality (IR) is sharp up to a multiplicative constant $1000 log (1/p)$. 

For any subset π of ρ(G)′, it follows that G has a normal, abelian, Hall π-subgroup, and hence also a Hall π′-subgroup. Flipping the roles of π and π′ gives your first existence claim. Chapter 14 of Isaacs's Character Theory textbook contains this and further results, which I assume are already known. For instance, the classical: 

The solvable case was proved by Huppert in 1957. It is presented in textbook form in chapter XII.7 of Huppert–Blackburn's Finite Groups Vol. 3. This includes full proof that only certain exceptional cases can occur, but not full coverage of the exceptional cases. It includes an outline of Hering (et al.)'s proof of the insoluble case, which is spread over several papers (which are the best source of the proof). The solvable case is not classical and is not presented in Robinson's textbook. Presumably people are thinking of solvable groups of prime degree. Cameron's book does not contain any proof, and its tables are partial so be careful of relying on it for details. Obviously the classical textbooks can only present partial pictures as the results were not known at the time.
