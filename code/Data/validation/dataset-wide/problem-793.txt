The program I used to compute this: $URL$ The list of transits I computed while solving this: $URL$ $URL$ Although I believe this answer is correct, Stellarium does not agree with me, and HORIZONS doesn't compute positions past 9999 CE, so don't put too much faith in this answer, since there's no good way to confirm it. I believe that I'm correct and Stellarium is wrong this far in the future, but it could be the other way around. Even if my calculations are correct, the uncertainty in calculating the relevant positions (Sun, Merucry, Venus, Earth) this far in the future is high. On their own transit pages, NASA only computes Venus transits from 2000 BCE to 4000 CE, and Mercury transits from 1601 CE to 2300 CE, even though they could've made the same calculations I made from 13201 BCE to 17091 CE: 

$URL$ gives G*m for the Sun as . $URL$ gives G as If these numbers were exact (they're not), the sun's mass (after converting m^3 to km^3 above) would be: 165890550052424250000000000000000000/83423 kg or about 1988546924138717739712069812881.3396785059276218789 kg or 1.9885469241387177397120698128813396785059276218789*10^30 kg Of course, that level of precision is ridiculously unwarranted, but I would argue that's the most precise value you can get, if you accept NASA's definitions of the sun's Gm and the universe's G. 

Firstly, if you're planet spotting, don't worry too much about light pollution. The planets are some of the brightest objects in the sky and some (especially Jupiter) can easily be observed even with a full Moon - the full Moon (along with the Sun!) is the biggest contributor to light pollution! Take a look at the list of brightest stars ( $URL$ ), which also contains estimates for the brightness of the Sun, Moon and major planets. There aren't typically any stars brighter from Earth than Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Mercury and precious few brighter than Saturn. I'm going to suggest you probably have seen many of the planets - but just didn't recognise them. +1 for Stellarium ( $URL$ ). It's free, intuitive and very visual to use. You can put in your local viewing location and it gives you a view for any time of the night, future or past. At the time of writing (23 July 2017), Saturn and Jupiter should be looking good for the Southern Hemisphere. This rotates throughout the year, and Stellarium will help with this. Do a web search for "the sky at night in the southern hemisphere" and you'll find a number of examples of websites with highlights to look for when you get out. Couple of final suggestions: 

I ended up finding this on page 14 of the Edmund Scientific Holiday Sale catalog, with sale ending on December 31, 1983: 

The galaxy's catalog name, SDSS J1126+2944, also gives its direction. This means the galaxy is at approximately 11h26m right ascension and 29 degrees 44 minutes north declination. The "full name" of the galaxy, given here: $URL$ is "SDSS J112659.54+294442.8", which gives its position even more precisely. A finder chart is here: $URL$ 

which suggests the calculation is being done in arcminutes, not degrees. Unfortunately, this doesn't help, since the result is 76.5283 arcminutes, which is nowhere near 2 degrees 19 minutes 28 seconds (which is 139.467 arcminutes). 134*sin(0:32) may refer to 32 seconds of arc, and the result is 0.02 which is 1 minute or arc (0:01). Terrible use of notation here if that actually is the case. 

This suggests NASA isn't confident enough of Mercury/Venus (and Earth/Sun) positions to predict that far in the past or future, so my results may be fairly inaccurate. 

Main caveat: Like HORIZONS and the sunrise/sunset tables above, I assume 34 arcminutes of refraction at the horizon. That's reasonable for most locations, but may be unreasonable close the pole, where the longest sunrises and sunsets occur. In particular, refraction can change rapidly at these latitudes, allowing for potentially much longer sunrises and sunsets. I now believe that $URL$ is inaccurate, and will ping the author to let him know. 

Hmm - good question, Michael; and thanks for sharing your images with us. For me, it's about eliminating possible causes: 

I don't think stellar parallax would directly help us as it (in the modern day) just tells us that we are in orbit around the sun and little about the Earth-Moon system itself. Let's look at how a Ptolemy equivalent on the Moon (call him Moon-Ptolemy) might see it. He would have no way of distinguishing the Earth-Moon system from his assumption that he is just sitting on a solid object at the center of creation. Of course he wouldn't see a "moon" in orbit around him, but he would see the Sun, stars and major planets. Stellar parallax (to him, the Sun "moving through the Zodiac) would just tell him that Sun is rotating around his Moon, as are the planets. The existence of planetary epicycles would be a curiosity required to make his model work - but it does work and he has no notion of the Earth Moon-Galileo might (or might not) be able to develop the heliocentric model - he misses out on one key insight that Earth-Galileo had: that the Earth wasn't special because other planets also had moons. Moon-Galileo would find the orbital system of Jupiter interesting but not a key insight, so he might not develop the new model. Even so, someone else would. Nevertheless, in a qualitative scientific world, there would still be nothing to help the Moon observer deduce the existence of the Earth behind the horizon. I suspect the truth would become unavoidable when orbital mechanics developed sufficiently to incorporate mass and gravity into calculation. It might have been around the time of Moon-Kepler. I'm not sure I agree with the comments looking at observations of the planets - I don't see how they help distinguish between an Earth-Moon system as opposed to a simple, very large, rotating Moon body with no co-orbiter (which would be a natural assumption to make). Even the monthly changes in parallax caused by the rotation of the Moon around the Earth might be waved away by suggesting the simple rotation of a much larger Moon body - though our hero might certainly question the compatibility of this with the apparent curvature and distance to their Moon horizon. 

Assuming "will measure the positions" means "will measure the parallaxes", this appears to be referring to the final version of GAIA which will be published in the early 2020s. To make things easier, $URL$ has a "tgas_source" subdirectory which just includes the 2,057,066 stars for which there is additional data (so you don't have to download the entire much larger GAIA archive). 

Here, you see the loop-de-loop orbit you originally expected. Now, what if we reduce the distance to 10 million km (still very large): $URL$ As you can see, the loop-de-loops are gone, although the orbit still has some "sharp points", which we don't see in the Moon's real orbit. If we reduce the distance to 3 million km, we get something closer to what expect: $URL$ Here, we have a wobbly circle, closer to what actually happens. Of course, the Moon's actual distance from the Earth is only 0.35 million km, so the actual wobbles are much smaller. I tried to do a graphic of those, but the two orbits ended up on top of each other. 

which tells us start 98036 is at J2000 right ascension 19h55m18.77s, declination +06 degrees, 24'28.6" declination, and has a magnitude of 3.71. This agrees almost perfectly with $URL$ (the declination is slightly off, but this may be because Beta Aquilae is a double star, and Hipparcos references the brighter star and Wikipedia references the midpoint of the double star-- or something). There are other files in the stellarium github (eg, culture-specific star names) that also use the Hipparcos numbering designation. 

In theory, yes; in practice probably not ... i) It's perhaps helpful to take the Andromeda galaxy as a first working example. It is somewhat bigger than our own Milky Way galaxy but not so big as to be a problem. When we look at Andromeda, it appears to occupies an area about 3 degrees by 1 degree. By comparison, the Moon appear about 0.5 degree across. Andromeda is a good target to see, a little faint but it is just about visible with the naked eye on a good night. Andromeda is about 2.5 million light years away so, even travelling at the speed of light, it would take 2.5 million years to get far away enough from the Milky Way so we could look back and see our galaxy like we see Andromeda today. ( In Star Trek, the writers seemed broadly to limit themselves to adventures within our galaxy for the same reason: within the realms of sci-fi, perhaps they could justify getting around the Milky Way within a reasonable period of time - not so to travel between the galaxies ) ii) To reduce the apparent size of our galaxy to a dot would require travelling at least 10x further or probably more - depending on how you are observing. 50 million light years, anyone? 

when the local sideral time is almost a minute ahead of the sun's right ascension. What's going on here? Since the Earth is an ellipsoid, and not a sphere, it turns out that "up", the direction perpendicular to a location on Earth, is NOT directly away from the center of the Earth (it turns out gravity acts in a direction that is neither towards the center of the Earth nor perpendicular to the surface, but that's not relevant for this question): see $URL$ for details. If you want really accurate calculations you'll have to use $URL$ 's $URL$ function. Although this doesn't cause the discrepancy above, another consideration is a location's elevation above the surface of the Earth, which can also have slight effect (since "up" isn't always towards the zenith). Happily, one thing you can ignore is refraction, since refraction at the zenith is effctively zero. My $URL$ is a very approximate representation of where the Sun is overhead and is generated by $URL$ 

I might be misunderstanding your question, but using HORIZONS ($URL$ with these settings should give you the data you need: 

and looking at the second sentence, we have "they do not revolve around the same poles [...] but follow the oblique ecliptic". Assuming the use of poles later in the page is the same, he's pointing out the north ecliptic pole (which is in Draco) is not the same as the north celestial pole (which is in Ursa Minor and close to the star Polaris). 

You said "The thing that I am really puzzled about is that through the lens the image did not look like either of these pictures" - please could you clarify what you meant by lens here; were you talking about using the scope, Barlow and a separate eyepiece, or were you using scope, Barlow and DSLR with live preview lens? It is much more common for people to image the planets using a video stacked approach. The idea behind this is that they are very bright (so exposure times can be very short) and the limiting factor is random blurring caused by atmospheric seeing. If you take a video file of say 1000 frames at 20fps then there is software available that can combine these into good shots (e.g. AutoStakkert, Registax). What DSLR are you using? For what it's worth, the human eye is very good at picking details and resolving out the seeing on bright objects, so my first photo attempts were dreadful compared to what I could see in the eyepiece. I'd recommend you try reading up on this approach for inspiration. Some (but not all) DSLRs do allow video recording modes, so it might be worth a try. Saturn is definitely a tricky object to go for - at the time of writing Jupiter isn't in a good Northern Hemisphere space (I'd normally suggest trying it out as a somewhat easier target). Have you tried practising by imaging parts of the Moon - it's a much easier target to build confidence and practical experience? Please don't be disheartened ... it took me a couple of years to get semi-decent pictures of Saturn 

Since the collision is perfectly elastic, the ball's velocity goes from -80 km/h from the train's reference point (negative being towards the train) to +80 km/h from the train's reference point, a speed increase of 160 km/h. For a stationery observer, therefore, the velocity goes from -30 km/h (towards the train) to 130 km/h, an increase of 160 km/h. The situation you describe only applies if the train isn't moving. I made an error in units below, assuming the train is moving at 50 km per second (not hour) and that the ball is moving at 30 km per second (not hour), am I'm too lazy to correct it. The general principle, however, still applies. The confusion may occur because we're ignoring the train's loss of momentum, which means the train is going slower after the collision, and moving backwards in its own frame of reference. A slightly more detailed calculation: 

The 0h line, however, will look more like this (blue vertical line in the center of the image), and the celestial north pole will be in Cepheus: 

(Pluto is invisible but at the center of the cross-- the bright object nearby is 13 Oph, not Pluto). A perhaps more interesting question: what is the closest approach of the two orbits, even if the planets in question aren't occupying that given point in the orbit. 

Yes, you can. I use a Newtonian reflector, 200mm objective, 1000mm focal length. Uranus is sometimes right on the fringe of naked eye but looks a lot clearer as a small but recognisable blueish disc. Neptune, sadly, just looks like a star to me ... but you can find it. 

Are there stars - in our galaxy, as stars in other galaxies are not individually visible - that are 'dead' but still alight to us. The Slate article you linked is rather good in this respect: i) the lifespan of a given star is much longer than the time taken for light to reach us so it is unlikely that this is the case and ii) most stars have an extended extinction compared to the time taken for light to reach us, with few going out in a supernova flash. Hence it is pretty unlikely that this is the case at the moment - but it will happen on occasion If there is a specific star which is 'dead' but still alight to us - could we know? Not really, as no useful information will be travelling to us faster than the speed of light. The best we might do is to observe a supernova and then say "this event happened x years ago" 

As noted in $URL$ the length of sunrise/sunset varies from approximately 128/cos(latitude) seconds at the equinoxes to approximately 142/cos(1.14*latitude) at the solstices. More specifically, here's the length of sunrise/sunset at various latitudes: 

except that it's "Planetimer" (and not "Planet-timer"), catalog number H9454. A 1200dpi image somewhat shows how it's supposed to work: 

You probably got this far yourself, but here is my absolutely wild speculative guess on why this could be 24 May 1587 on the Gregorian calendar: 

(this is actually looking from the north pole "down" to the Earth's center, so we would expect a negative z value). The interesting part of the results: 

Both of these look similar to my answer, so I'm reasonably confident that I'm correct this time. $URL$ if anyone wants to check my work Things to note: 

This doesn't really answer your question, but the orientation of the moon is changing constantly, because we tend to compare the moon to the horizon, and think of the horizon as fixed. Here's a video demonstrating the effect (simulated) for the full moon over London on August 28-29 (all times GMT): $URL$ If you were changing location, you would see a similar gradual effect. The only real place you would see a true "flip" is near where the moon is at zenith (overhead), because, as you passed the zenith point, the moon may go from being 89.999 degrees high in the western sky to 89.999 degrees high in the eastern sky (and flip directions because you're now comparing it to a different horizon). Realistically, when the moon is that high, you probably wouldn't be comparing it to the nearest horizon.
