What's going on when a for-profit company makes a threat? The same thing that is happening when does anything. It is trying to increase its profits, relative to what would happen if it didn't do the thing. In this case, it's trying to influence policy to protect its profits. It has decided that issuing the threat gives their profits a better chance than not issuing the threat. That probably means that they believe that their profits will be lower with the new policy than without it. The thing it's threatening is, in a sense, neither here nor there: the threat itself is the action. Should the policy that a company opposes, get implemented, then the company then has a choice, to stay or to go, and the decision criterion will be: will them staying result in higher or in lower profits than them staying. That's a completely different issue to the thing they issued the threat over, and the threat doesn't tell us anything useful about it. And companies are often wrong about the impacts of policy anyway. In summary, treat their statements on policy with a lot of scepticism. 

Bitcoin doesn't have a value. It doesn't create wealth - it destroys it. It therefore has no yield. It does, however, have a price. It's designed to have tightly-constrained supply, so that those people who got bitcoins early, can get rich by luring more people into buying bitcoin. And demand is just as large as the number of gullible people who can be fooled into buying it. That combination of extremely inelastic supply, and very malleable demand, creates very volatile pricing. This extreme volatility makes it very impracticable as a currency, as does its extremely inflexible supply. 

Depreciation is tax-deductible. The firm in question pays taxes. If depreciation increases, then taxes paid decrease. If taxes paid decrease, then cash flow increases. ceteris paribus 

Ultimately, yes, in almost all cases, belief in future dividends is the only long term value of stock. Buy-backs / stock re-purchases only have value because of that belief in future dividends: a buy-back just means that future dividends will be divided across fewer shares, thus higher dividends per share. There are some corner-case rare exceptions where some of the demand for a stock (and hence some of the market price) may reflect something else, in addition to the discounted value of future dividends; for example: 

In general, yes it's an externality: it's a cost borne by others. How do we know it's a cost with real economic value? Because in general, properties with good light and better views tend to attract higher purchase prices and higher market rents. And there's a difference between "view/light might be obscured some time in the future" versus "they are obscured now" - in sufficiently sophisticated and liquid markets, that would be captured by the price of an option. 

Any monetary expansion can be inflationary. Inflationary pressures come about when there's more money chasing the same amount of goods and services; or the same money chasing fewer goods and services. A monetary expansion means there's more money. If the amount of goods and services doesn't increase in proportion, then there will be inflation. 

No, they don't negate the broken-window fallacy. You're overthinking it, and that's leading you to the wrong conclusion. The breaking of the window represents a loss of wealth. The activities around it are neither here nor there - they do not change the fact that the breaking of the window represents a loss of wealth. The existence of functional insurance markets just means that there are somewhat efficient markets to estimate the cost of that damage. 

Would it be more consumer-friendly? Probably, for some customers. But that's not the basis on which they'll make their decisions. Their decision is: would it be more profitable? And the answer to that, is: no, probably not. Product differentiation and market segmentation allow them to extract more profit from a wider customer base. They use different products with differences in interest rates, interest-free periods, other charges, and side-benefits, to suit different market segments. This allows them to convert what would have been consumer-surplus in a single-product market, into producer surplus, i.e. more profit for the card issuer. 

The justification goes back to the work of Pigou in the early 20th century. The essence is this: the burning of fossil fuels creates a negative externality: a cost that is incurred, but not by that consumer, but by the general population, and for a century or so. This in essence creates a kind of "social subsidy": the price does not fully reflect the costs. This means that fossil fuels are over-consumed, relative to the economically efficient quantity. As I wrote on that other answer: the "Economics Help" site explains the issue 

People trade derivatives because they believe that they will be better off if they do trade them, than if they don't. There can be lots of different reasons for that belief. Here are some. 

The assumption almost never holds. Not for televisions, nor pretty much any other consumer durable (nor wheat, but that's not a consumer durable anyway). It's a simplifying assumption that's used to make a particular problem easier to solve. But in reality, the market changes continuously; furthermore there are often oligopolistic forces at play. The least that should be done, when making the assumption, is to include a discussion about the possible implications on ones results, when the assumption does not hold. One could also do a sensitivity test with and without the assumption; and/or cite other studies that have gone deeper into the implications of using the assumption. Classical economics has a long, disreputable history of making big claims on the basis of invalid assumptions. It's down to us to change these bad habits. 

It goes on further on pages 10-11 to define some aspects of the subsidy in more detail. In particular: 

The distinction between land and physical capital is based on some of their economic properties, particularly relating to investment: whether it can be reproduced or not; whether it has a finite lifetime (compared to the human lifetime). Almost all land is not reproducible, and does not have a finite lifetime. Physical capital is reproducible, and does have a finite lifetime. Hence, almost all land is not physical capital. There are corner cases, where land is reproducible, and may appear and then disappear again in less than a handful of human lifetimes: in those very rare cases, that particular land behaves more like physical capital rather than how land generally behaves, and so could be classed as such. 

The word rent has a general meaning, and a specific technical meaning within economics. As the article you've linked to states explicitly: 

To summarise crudely: the tariffs are punitive, to give all producers within the EEA as much of an advantage as the trade negotiators could deliver. And because the EEA represents a wealthy group of around half a billion consumers (very many of whom are not individually wealthy; but collectively are wealthy), the EU has huge negotiating power on trade agreements: probably about even with China and the USA, and superior to everyone else. So countries outside the EEA tend to get a poor deal in general. There is a wide range of tariffs set for goods and services for countries accredited to the WTO in their own right (the UK is not) - as you can see from your linked site. But each of the EEA's significant trading partners seeks a bilateral deal with it, because the pain is too high otherwise. That site - the one you quite reasonably describe as "unbelievably complicated" - is as transparent and as clear a description of tariffs as I've seen anywhere. And yet it still has vastly over-simplified matters: there's a host of regulation that goes with the tariffs, to ensure that what's imported into the European Economic Area (EEA) is safe and fit for purpose. Within individual trade publications, there was some discussion on levels of tariffs imposed on countries outside the EEA for that particular trade: so, for example, the Financial Times had quite a lot of coverage on the potentially devastating effect on the financial sector that provides so much of the UK's income; and various manufacturing industries talked about the existential threat that Brexit poses to them; but as you can see from your linked site, general-purpose publications didn't have a chance of getting into the detail across all goods and services. 

Greeks deposit notes and coins with the bank, and in exchange gain a credit to their bank account to the same value in Euro. Has anyone lost value? No. Greek banks deposit the physical currency with the Greek Central Bank, and in exchange gain a credit to their account with the Greek Central Bank, to the same value in Euro. Has anyone lost value? No. The Greek Central Bank punches holes in all the notes, and in exchange gain a credit to their account at the European Central Bank, to the same value in Euro. Has anyone lost value? No. The Greek Central Bank now switches to the New Drachma, and reintroduces the New Drachma notes (Euro notes with holes in them) back into circulation. Has anyone lost value? No. 

Population size isn't just about birth rate. It's also about death rate and net migration. If the health of India's population continues to improve, then life expectancy will increase, and population size will continue to grow until life expectancy stops increasing, assuming zero net migration. Net inward migration would also increase the population size. 

It would be easy enough to subject the question to simple quantitative analysis - get the time-series of historical oil prices and away we go. Or, we can take a quick qualitative approach and get the same answer: The Rule just sets out what the most economically efficient path would be. That's nothing at all to do with how things happen in reality: it's just how things behave in textbooks for beginners. For example, it relies on an assumption of perfect foreknowledge; whereas, in the real world, we have previously-unanticipated innovation that radically changes both industry's cost structures, and the amount of known reserves - as your fracking example illustrates. 

I note that you've asked about inflation, but in your comments you've referred to the case of Zimbabwe, which wasn't just inflation, it was hyper-inflation. As the velocity of money tends to stay within quite a narrow range, then monetary expansion from faster circulation of currency isn't, in practice, going to lead to hyper-inflation: so hyper-inflation would - in reality - only come about from a rapid and sustained expansion of the monetary base by the Central Bank.
