Yes it does dry shoes much faster. When long distance hiking it is definitely a nice thing to be able to stop in town and dry your shoes overnight using newspapers. It will draw a lot of the dampness right out of your footwear. This is a known trick and many people will attest to its magic. 

You are likely talking about eye flies. They feed on lachrymal secretion which your eyes produce. When they get too intense, if hiking, I either walk faster and away from wet area or use a good head net. Peter Vacco have good information on flies and also happen to make really good head nets. 

Fixed length non-adjustable trekking poles have the advantages of being lighter, comprise of less failure points and sturdier (especially for cheap poles). On the other side of the medal, transporting them by airplane is more costly and they can be inconvenient when hitch hiking to/from a trailhead. I have used slightly longer fixed trekking poles in order to be able to use them with my shelter system. I personally did not mind adjusting my hand on the long handle depending on the inclination of the trail. In fact, if they would have been non-fixed I would seldom adjust them as it takes time. I prefered fixed length poles because of their weight and not having to adjust them every time I setup my shelter. I do not use loop handles so this wasn't a problem for me. If you prefer quick adjustment and fixed-length; an interesting compromise are the Black Diamond Z-Pole Series trekking poles. They are fixed and collapsible for the most part. The top-most section allows you to adjust it to your liking. 

Make sure you study the tide tables in advance. The closer you get to the sea, the more you will have to battle the tides, which in Germany are quite extreme. When the tide is coming in, you might not be able to make any forward progress for a couple of hours, even when you are still miles away from the baltic sea. Some of those rivers and canals are shared with huge container ships, which have the ability to displace quite a bit of water. If you pull over somewhere where there is no floating dock, make sure that your kayak is not anywhere near the water, or you might come back and it is gone! Get ready for some surprised looks, especially on the main thoroughfares! 

I have friends who say stuffing your rainfly prolongs the life of the tent, because folding waterproof material over and over is going to make it leak. I have other friends who say folding and rolling the rainfly prolongs the life of the tent, because stuffing waterproof material over and over is going to make it leak. I was wondering if there has been any testing that proofs either of the two camps (pun intended) correct, or that shows that there is not significant difference between the two approaches. 

In Canada, you will need a hunting license depending on the province (or territory) and type of game you wish to hunt. Typically, a safety course is also required. For example, moose requires applying for a draw which is valid for a certain zone as determined by the department of natural resources. 

If you are looking for a cooking system for backpacking the Caldera Sidewinder Ti-Tri have the option of using a titanium floor for this exact purpose. 

Katahdin is the highest summit in the area and camping is not permitted. Surrounding mountains are not very high and you should be able to camp at the bottom of them with some minimal planning if you're concerned about the temperature. A 30F bag is most likely what you will end up using and I would bring that with a few extra light layers that I can use during the day and at night if needed. e.g. a light puffy & windbreaker pants. If you use lean-to's, these can something feel colder because they are fully open on one side. I have used a 40F quilt in Baxter State Park, in early July, without any trouble. 

If all of the above is taken into consideration and the anchor is bomber, it is perfectly fine to give a climber several feet of slack, if and only if he/she is asking for it. My rule of thumb boils down to: Give the climber what she needs. Most of the time this means, if he wants to be kept tight, keep him tight, if she wants slack, giver her some slack. Sometimes giving the climber what he/she needs means ignoring what he/she sais, and doing what is safest: A cocky climber might want more slack just off of a ledge. An inexperienced climber might want to be kept tight after just having cleared a roof with a lot of rope out, which could result in injury when the feet don't have anything to push against but when the first body-part that does is the face when it hits the top of the roof (it might be best to altogether avoid situations like the latter with inexperienced climbers.) As a closing remark: Make sure there is at least one experienced climber at the craig setting up the top-rope and overseeing the belaying. That way, if the climber is asking for slack because he/she is getting pulled off the rock and the belayer is unsure if that is a safe thing to do there is someone to address the situation. Some situations might even warrant a spotter, if there is a lot of rope stretch and an uneven landing. 

The general guideline for tornado safety is to get as low to the ground as possible and assume the tornado safety crouch: 

I would say that most filters will do just fine with 20 liters of water without the recommended maintenance. If there was one I would consider it would be Sawyer Squeeze. The Squeeze is a hollow fiber filter which can be forced (squeezed). It is affordable, reliable and simple to use. The water is available immediately; you can even drink as you filter. I find it easier to use than a pump-style filter. You may also use it as part of a gravity system. The Squeeze requires back-flushing using a syringe. In my experience, this is rarely required if the water is relatively clean. You may choose to bring the syringe with you although I personally would not. Another option is to mail it to yourself for long hikes (i.e. bounce box). With clear water it repeatedly worked just fine for weeks-long stretches. When it requires back-flushing you will notice reduced flow rates. The filter is remarkably simple and does not have many moving parts. I did have problems with the O-Ring becoming misshapen, which resulted in leaks and un-usability. The problem corrected itself after a certain time. You should not tighten the bottle too hard as it may cause issues (now I know). I also owned a MSR HyperFlow but had it failed on me in the field. I would not recommend it as it is more error-prone and more costly than the Squeeze. Ceramic filters are also reliable and field maintainable. However, I personally had bad luck with those as the cartridge broke down on a trip. For non-filters, you could use a drops such as Aquamira. I would recommend transferring the contents of the bottles into a secondary container as the corners of the bottles tend to crack and leak. I've had it happen to me twice and I have met other hikers with the same problem. I believe Aquamira is aware of the problem but I do not know if they have corrected it. You could also keep them in the original plastic box which offers some extra protection for those sad cornered bottles. SteriPens are great but unreliable for multi-week trips and costly (battery usage). 

Bonus fact: There are climbing knots where directionality does matter. The clove hitch is the most common one; When tying a clove hitch, make sure the loaded strand is the one closest to the spine of the carabiner. 

TL;DNR: It depends if you are backpacking or car camping. I have owned several mesh tents with windowless rainflies. I have not owned any tents with a "window" (an opening to the tent not meant for ingress and egress), though I remember them from my youth. The tents I have owned would all qualify as backpacking tents, meaning they where constructed with a focus on saving weight and withstanding wind and rain. If you see me lugging a tent around, chances are that I brought it to facilitate an extended stay in nature and I try to spend the least amount of time as possible locked away in anything with walls. If I expect a lot of rain I often bring a tarp in addition to a tent. Under the tarp I can cook and hang out. If I want fresh air during the night, I leave the rainfly-zipper of my tent open but close the mesh. I normally don't leave the rainfly off. If I don't expect rain, there is little dew and I am somewhere in the wilderness I normally don't even set up the tent. I could imagine use-cases for tents where having a window could be nice. If you bring a tent to a picnic to provide shelter from the sun or from rain, a window might be nice to keep an eye on the little ones. If you are planning an extended road trip and want an experience more similar to traveling by RV, a tent with windows might be nicer than a backpacking tent with a windowless rainfly. Tents like the previous two are probably not very useful for backpacking though, since they are likely large and heavy. 

What type of cookware you choose depends on what type of cooking you do. Titanium is certainly the lightest, and it's great if all you do in your pot is boil water to add to dehydrated foods (Lipton noodles, Mountain House, homemade boil-in-bag meals, etc.) or to make beverages. I've never seen or heard of a titanium pot shattering at low temperatures. However, any super-thin, uncoated pan will have trouble distributing heat evenly which leads to hot spots and burned food. A titanium mug works great for me, but then, I prefer to keep my meals as simple and no-cook as possible when I'm backpacking. If you enjoy backcountry cooking, you may be disappointed in ti cookware, especially considering the price point. If you plan on doing anything more involved, such as eggs or pancakes or stirfry, take a look at hard anodized aluminum cookware, such as the MSR Aplinist or GSI Pinnacle series. Hard anodized aluminum weighs only a little more than titanium, is cheaper, and offers several advantages over other aluminum pots. It is durable, offers excellent heat distribution, and is easier to clean as it possesses some nonstick properties of its own even without a Teflon coating. Some hard anodized pans are sold with a Teflon finish, so if that's an issue for you, shop around or examine them in person before buying. If you do go with nonstick cookware, be sure to use bamboo or Lexan utensils to avoid scratching the finish. I use hard-anodized aluminum pans from Calphalon for home cooking and I love them. They heat very evenly and are virtually nonstick. The material is much less reactive than plain aluminum (e.g. it doesn't turn the sulphur in your cauliflower yellow!), and leeches virtually no aluminum into your food. For perspective: there are about 50 mg of aluminum in an antacid tablet; if you do all your cooking in uncoated aluminum pans, you'll consume about 3.5 mg of aluminum per day, and with a hard anodized pan that number is even lower. Bon appetit! 

I think the fact that you are finding worms in your garage and basement supports my hypothesis that the worms where trying to seek shelter in your building. You might not have seen this phenomenon before because the weather turnaround might have occurred unusually quickly. 

To answer your question as to the ideal break position when using the munter: It depends. It depends on your comfort and experience with the knot, its application and the situation. I have rappeled and belayed with munter-hitches on numeral occasions. 

Is there a good resource for quickly identifying peaks that are visible on the summit of a north-american peak? Currently I use a topographical map and painstakingly identify each individual peak. I was hoping someone knew about a resource where there is a panoramic picture taken from the summit with all named peaks identified. If this question is too broad, I especially care about the Sierra Nevada. 

Google Earth can give you an elevation profile of pretty much anything. There are 4 ways to go about: 

These three tents are very similar; freestanding, double-wall dome construction. The limelight is a bit heavier with more floor space. The trail light does not have a transversal pole. Any of them should do just fine. I used a similar tent, the MSR Hubba Hubba, for a while and was quite satisfied with the design. I now retired the Hubba Hubba in preference of a Stratospire 2 as it is more lightweight and spacious (also cheaper compared to the Hubba Hubba). However, it is not freestanding and require trekking poles instead of DAC poles. 

Most likely it is safe to consume, but I would avoid cooking with that water as it may change the taste of your dish. 

According to wildwoodsurvival, the sand helps remove suspended particles. Charcoal helps to remove chemical impurities. The charcoal plays the role of active carbon. The water filtration process use multiple materials, from coarse to fine, to prevent clogging. As a last stage, the charcoal can also help remove some bacterias. Note that the author of the video recommendeds this method solely for water filtration and not water purification. 

I am a staunch proponent of leave no trace. I don't carry dish detergent (sand and small rocks work much better on stainless steel anyways,) and I don't use soap or shampoo, not even of the biodegradable kind (being smelly I have heard might even help with repelling mosquitos...) I do however use toothpaste, and am feeling pretty bad about it, since I leave a chemical behind in the wilderness. When I spit out my toothpaste, I attempt to spray it over a large area, to avoid creating concentrations of the chemical, and I avoid leaving it behind on fragile vegetation, but I would like to find an alternative that adheres more to the leave no trace philosophy. What are my options without sacrificing the health of my teeth on those multi-week treks? 

Please make sure you know what you are doing before you attempt this feat. Just because you have successfully rappeled there before, does not automatically mean you were/are qualified to do so. Very overhanging cliffs can't be rappelled in the traditional sense. "Bouncing," like another answer here suggests, does not work on steep overhangs. You have to down-climb, and if that is too difficult, you have to down-aid. On multi-pitch rappel routes, it is not enough to know how to ascend the rope. You have to know how to actually climb back up! Aid climbing is a skill that takes years to develop, is very exhausting and takes a lot of time if you are a novice. Trust me, I have underestimated my aid-climbing skills before. For steep overhangs you will need to bring actual climbing gear (cams, nuts, aid-ladders, daisy chains, and possibly even hooks, pitons, copper heads or a bolt kit). If your route finding skills are lacking you can get yourself into serious trouble, even more so as if you had tried to climb the cliff. Make sure you know how to pendulum and tension traverse. I don't mean to sound insolent, but from your vague terminology it sounds like you are not a seasoned aid climber. My advice is: Don't do anything you can't "undo:" If you rappel for several overhanging pitches and realize that the rappel anchor is missing, or that you are off route, you will have to climb back up, since you have pulled your ropes. There are multiple accident reports about this kind of feat: 1) Stranded—Unable to Locate Rappel Anchor, California, Yosemite Valley, El Capitan Shows that even seasoned climbers with aid experience might get into trounble. 2) Rappellers Rescued off of El Capitan An example of how exhausting getting off route might become. 3) Rescue of Climber Injured in Rappelling Accident Stresses how important route finding is. These were all seasoned climbers! 

In the article "Is that newfangled cookware safe?" no special mention is made for titanium. Titanium is not commonly found in cookware other than backpacking because it is simply terrible for any cooking tasks other than perhaps boiling water and it is expensive. Many backpackers are willing to pay the extra money for extra weight saving. According to naturalnews titanium is the safest: 

There is a thread about the topic on backpacker. It doesn't quite resolve the dilemma. Personally I stuff the fly on the outside of my backpack because it is faster. It may also have a chance to breath/dry. Because packing and unpacking is faster when stuffing, there is a chance that I will get it out to dry for a few minutes in the afternoon if it is wet. I think the more important factor is storing the fly wet which sometimes the weather does not leave us with much options. If you fold it, I'd consider not folding it in a too systematic way as to not stress the material in singular areas of the frabric.
