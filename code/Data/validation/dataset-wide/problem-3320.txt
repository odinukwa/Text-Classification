That trait of elliptical answers is simply 'Focus'. Wh-questions have a Focus, and the answer to them must be an expression that denotes something in the category of entities that the asker has decided ask about, to focus his question on. Violating the syntactic Focus principle can also be considered a violation of principles like 'relevance' (in Grice's sense), since it entails offering information the question presupposes as known and that is, therefore, redundant if repeated, or even as a violation of 'Economy'in Chomsky's sense, and, depending on which theory of syntax you adopt, the unacceptability of examples like your (b-h) above will be explicable as a breach of all or of just some of those principles. 

the clitic pronominals are in the dative case and, in Spanish, where, contrary to Modern English, the dative/accusative contrast remains relevant, must be analysed as indirect objects (and, of course, cannot be converted into subjects of passive sentences, etc.). This fact does not show when the clitics are first or second person, as in that case the Spanish dative and accusative forms are, as in English, also homonymous and indistinguishable (i.e., me/nos, te/os), but it does show very clearly when the clitics are third person: LE/LES gustó el discurso del Rector (with dative clitics > indirect objects) are fine, but LO/LA/LOS/LAS gustó el discurso del Rector (with accusative clitics > direct objects) are terrible. 

Wow, the example is indeed probably offensive to some, and I apologize in advance to anyone who is offended by the fact that I am now going to risk an answer. I agree with the question's premise that one hell of a is frozen expression that functions syntactically like an adjective. Thus one hell of a is an adjective modifying dick. Interestingly, the expression suck...dick is also a fixed expression, that is, the two words suck and dick build one meaning together, namely 'fellatio'. The meaning is therefore non-compositional. We can see that one hell of a is functioning like an adjective because it can be replaced by a clear adjective: 

In a dependency grammar, complete subtrees are constituents. In both (1a) and (1b), the string much to learn is a constituent, i.e. a complete subtree. In (1b) it can be labeled the "topic". As a constituent, it has a concrete status in the dependency hierarchy. The following trees (taken from the article on topicalization in Wikipedia) illustrate this state of affairs in both a constituency and a dependency grammar: 

As is well known, the verbs need, require, lack and want, on the one hand, and deserve, justify, merit, warrant..., on the other, can exceptionally take -ING complement clauses with ‘concealed’ passive interpretations whenever the verb of the –ING clause allows passivisation. Such ‘concealed passive’ gerunds (Huddleston & Pullum's terminology) can, in fact, even be followed by agentive by-phrases and/or adverbs, as in Your hair needs cutting by a professional, or This draft needs checking carefully by the editor, all of which seems coherent enough with the claim that they are, indeed, a) passive in meaning (although ‘active’ in form) and b) real verbs (rather than de-verbal ING-nouns), as the presence of carefully in the latter example shows. Although such subordinate gerunds must allow passivisation and, therefore, be at least two-place, it is clear that they need not be ‘transitive’ in the strict sense of taking direct objects, because dyadic verbs taking prepositional, instead of direct object complements (e.g., look at x), can also receive passive interpretations after need, etc. (cf.The ignition needs looking at). The appropriate descriptive generalisation, then, seems to be that gerunds of ‘active’ (= non-stative) two-place verbs can receive passive interpretations when they complement verbs like need or deserve. What is rather less clear is whether (and, if so, why) such gerunds must be two-place predicates, as, obviously, many 'active' verbs that allow passivisation are not dyadic, but polyadic (e.g., 'ditransitive'), and others are ‘complex transitive’, but still take bona fide direct objects. Verbs like appoint, call, compare, distinguish, give, make, offer, persuade, send, to name but a few, are either ‘complex transitive’ (cf. appoint x + Predicative, make x + Predicative, make x + do y) or straightforward three-place predicates (cf. x compares y to z, x distinguishes y from z, x gives z y/x gives y to z, x offers z y/x offers y to z, x persuades y to do z, x sends y to z/x sends z y, etc.) I therefore recently asked in a very large English language forum whether the 'passive gerund' construction was possible with polyadic/multi-predicate gerunds like appointing, comparing, giving, making, offering, persuading, sending, etc. in cases like (1-10) or not and the unanimous answer of all the British and American speakers who replied was 'no', with the possible exception of example (7), which some - to their surprise - found more acceptable than the rest: (1) John deserves appointing __ Professor (=to be/being appointed ...) (2) Fauré deserves comparing __ to Prokofiev (= to be/being compared...) (3) This present deserves giving __ to somebody you really like (= to be/being given...) (4) Bill deserves giving __ this present (= to be/being given ...) (5) The children need making __ work harder (= to be/being made to ...) (6) Tom deserves offering __ tenure (= to be/being offered...) (7) I need persuading __ to marry again (= to be/being persuaded...) (8) I need persuading __ of the truth of such a claim (...to be/being persuaded...) (9) She deserves sending __ an invitation (= to be/being sent...) (10) She deserves sending __ to prison (= to be/being sent...) [Of course, the reason why some speakers found example (7) more acceptable than the others probably is that, in (7), the clause to marry again need not be interpreted as the third argument of persuade; it can also be understood as an adjunct of 'purpose', and, if so, persuade remains a dyadic predicate.] In sum, my guess is that dyadic active gerunds can be constructed as passive complements of need, deserve, etc., but higher-adicity ones cannot. My question to this community, then, is why? Can anybody here point me to a principled explanation of this restriction? Thank you in advance. 

We know that have to is not an auxiliary because it does not license subject-auxiliary inversion (??Have I to wash the car?), nor does it take not as a postdependent. What this means is that the modal adverb can easily immediately precede have to just like it can immediately precede other non-auxiliary verbs, e.g. 

This situation should be compared to possessive -s in a language that has a robust case system, such as German: 

The term part of speech is narrower than the term syntactic category. Every part of speech is a syntactic category, but many syntactic categories are not parts of speech. This holds particularly of the distinction between word and phrase. Words are parts of speech, but phrases are not. A noun is a part of speech and a syntactic category, whereas a noun phrase is a syntactic category but not a part of speech. An adjective is a part of speech and a syntactic category, whereas an adjective phrase is a syntactic category but not a part of speech. Thus the term part of speech denotes a subgroup inside the greater group denoted by syntactic category. 

In modern English, certain (but not, or not yet, all) 'time-interval-in-which-event-occurs' adjuncts can be constructed apparently (1) without temporal prepositions or case inflections (as in I received the money this morning/yesterday/last Friday/this week/last month/this summer/this year, etc.). The same construction occurs, although not exactly in all the same cases, in modern Spanish, several other western IE languages, and Mandarin. How common this construction is in Human Language, in general, I do not know, though. Could somebody here give me examples of languages - preferably IE ones, since I know virtually nothing about other language families - in which this 'bare NP adverbial' construction is also possible, and, especially, of languages, if any, in which it is not? (2) Thank you. (1) Please note my 'apparently': I am not saying that English or Spanish 'bare' NP time adjuncts are really 'bare' (i.e., lacking even 'covert' prepositions, phonetically null K(ase)-assigning functional heads,'inherent', lexically-conditioned Case-features, or whatever structural devices eventually account for their function and interpretation); all I meant to say is that at PF they seem to be mere uninflected NP's/DP's, rather than PP's, K(ase)P's, or Case-inflected NP's/DP's, and what I wanted to know is which other languages have this surface property and which, if any, do not. I know, though, that the question might be undecidable (for reasons briefly explained in note (2) below). (2) Needless to say, the construction will be trivially impossible, by definition, in any language in which all 'bare NP' time adjuncts must carry overt case inflections (accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental,...), as might well be the case in German, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Finnish,...Latin (but I am not sure whether, in such languages, literally all 'bare NP' adjuncts must be overtly inflected; maybe some needn't be). [Note that, at bottom, this uncertainty may turn into a theoretical issue, instead of a factual one, because the possibility cannot be discarded that even apparently uninflected NP's should after all covertly carry 'abstract' Case (e.g., whichever the 'default' Case may be in the corresponding language, say 'objective', in English). What's more, of course really 'bare' (here: prepositionless and caseless) NP's will be impossible on theoretical grounds if the 'Case Filter' is a correct principle of Human Language and applies to all NP's. However, even if it is, whether it must apply to all NP's, including (2nd. order) NP predicates, instead of just to argument NP's is unclear to me]. Such issues might make my question unanswerable, and I am ready to delete it if so considered, but my original intention was to leave them aside and just find out what other languages have 'bare NP' time adjuncts that seem caseless at 'surface structure/PF' and which, if any, prohibit them (possibly disregarding German, Polish, etc., if their 'bare NP' adverbials do, in fact, invariably require case-marked NP's, which, as I said, I do not know). 

This noun phrase might mean that the tray is made of Peruvian silver, or it could mean that they tray is Peruvian, whereby the silver may or may not be Peruvian. The ambiguity is again captured in the syntax in terms of whether Peruvian is a dependent of silver or of tray. Conventional grammar is going to fail to produce a plausible structural analysis of these cases if it does not have a means of disambiguating the meaning. The cues that are important for disambiguation are usually present in context, but if the grammar does not have a way to register these cues, the danger of producing the wrong syntactic analysis is great. In the case of a Peruvian silver tray, the disambiguation cue comes in the form of intonation. If the phrasal accent is on Peruvian, i.e. a PeRUvian silver tray, the tray is made of Peruvian silver, but if the accent is on silver, i.e. a Peruvian SILver tray, the tray is Peruvian. Concerning the first example, i.e. We like the baby in the crib, I am not aware of an intonational cue that disambiguates the utterance. I assume, rather, that the general meaning context would disambiguate the utterance, e.g. whether or not there is more than one baby in the discourse situation. So again, if the grammar being used does not have a means of acknowledging these cues, it will often produce an incorrect syntactic analysis. A similar situation obtains for lexical ambiguity, e.g. 

If what you are asking is 'What is the universal difference between English with and English and (or their Russian equivalents, for that matter), the question is wrongly formulated, and unanswerable, because other languages need not, and in fact do not, have lexical items with all the same syntactic and semantic properties English with and English and have. Your question should, therefore, as a minimum, be reworded in terms of a hypothetical (?unique!) difference between a would-be universal ?'conjunction function' & and a would-be universal 'comitative/groupal function' C (in the broadest possible sense of 'conjunction' and 'comitative'). The former, at least, is a relatively safe bet, since no human language can work without something (= obviously, not necessarily an and-like word!) that minimally licenses the expression of 'molecular facts/propositions' like [p & q] (where p, q are propositions that name events or states of affairs). Whether a 'group-forming/comitative' function C is also universally necessary is much less obvious, in my view. However, even that radically abstractive step would not be enough if what motivates your question is the need to understand the situation in Mandarin, where the '?coordinators' we need to render as English and do not really correspond, either in intrinsic meaning or in syntactic category, to English and at all, and where, viceversa, our English ands have to be rendered in Mandarin in terms of completely different things (?prepositions, sentence adverbs, particles, (correlative) verbs, [floating] quantifiers, or even 'zero', i.e.,'pragmatic' devices like sheer juxtaposition, with or without ellipsis for economy's sake, etc.). The obvious problem with English and (and its counterparts in other IE languages) - as opposed to our hypothetical function & - is that, even when it conjoins clauses, it is often far from being a 'pure' propositional conjunction function. A second, related, problem, of course, is that, at surface level at least, English and (like its nearest IE counterparts) can also 'conjoin' DPs/NPs, and, in general, XPs, X's and even Xs, and one of the consequences is that when it 'conjoins' DPs/NPs, it sometimes (but not in all cases!) is close in meaning to the preposition with (and to the would-be universal 'comitative/group-forming function' C). As to the former problem, we can approximate English and to a genuinely universal conjunction function & if we disregard the various 'adverbial' (e.g., temporal, causal, contrastive, etc.) implications that and may have and take into consideration only its truth-conditional contribution as a pure propositional function, which we can do by means of a careful choice of examples, cf. below. As to the second issue, of course, the only way to establish the real import of and as a '?coordinator' of NPs/DPs, etc. is to distinguish between 'surface' and 'deep' coordination, which in its turn entails calculating the 'Logical Forms' of the constructions involved in each case. Consider, for example, the following English cases of 'surface' [NP and NP] coordination and their possible interpretations: (1) John and Mary died. If we adhere to the abstractive strategy of counting only truth-conditional meaning, (1) has only one interpretation: it claims the existence of two death events with one participant each (= John died, Mary died = Mary died, John died). No particular time sequence or 'groupal/comitative' implication between the two deaths can be legitimately deduced from (1), so and is a pure & function here, in spite of the fact that, at surface level, it conjoins two NPs instead of two clauses. (2) John and Mary played the flute. Again, (2) has just one interpretation: it claims the existence of 2 flute-playing events (or sets of such events!) with one participant each (= John played the flute, Mary played the flute = Mary played the flute, John played the flute). Again, no time sequence, nor 'groupal/comitative' nuance, is entailed by (2), so and remains a pure & function here, as well, in spite of being a (surface) NP-coordinator. (3) John and Mary played the piano. In this case, on the contrary, two interpretations are possible. According to interpretation (3a), (3) says that there are two piano-playing events (or sets of such events) with one participant each (= John played the piano, Mary played the piano = Mary played the piano, John played the piano) but nothing follows from (3) as to the order in which each piano playing event occurred. According to interpretation (3b), on the contrary, (3) claims the existence of just one piano-playing event with two participants (John and Mary playing together, four hands). (4) John and Mary married. Again, (4) has two possible interpretations. According to interpretation (4a), (4) claims the existence of two separate wedding events (with four participants = John plus somebody else different from Mary, and Mary plus somebody else different from John), and, again, nothing can be legitimately inferred from (4) as to the order in which the two weddings occurred. According to interpretation (4b), on the contrary, (4) claims the existence of just one wedding, with John and Mary as the main participants (= John married Mary = Mary married John). (5) John and Mary argued, finally, has only one interpretation: there has been just one discussion event (or, possibly, a set of repeated discussion events of exactly the same type) with John and Mary as participants (= John argued with Mary = Mary argued with John), not two discussion events/sets of events with one participant each (John or Mary, respectively). In other words, the 'comitative' interpretation is the only one available here. Now, as far as I know, the Mandarin (?preposition) he2 (alternatively: yu3 or gen1, with some regional variation, apparently) can translate the (broadly) 'groupal/comitative' reading of English and in sentence (5) and in sentences (3) and, possibly, (4) when they have the interpretations (3b) and (4b), respectively, but, to my knowledge, none of them can translate and in sentences (1), (2), or even (3) when the latter has the interpretation (3a), that is, whenever two separate events are involved. To replicate such English (surface!) [NP and NP] coordination cases, Mandarin must resort to other devices which semantically approximate English and (to the extent it reduces to universal &), but clearly differ from English with - or from our hypothetical universal 'groupal/comitative' function C. In particular, Mandarin can use the 'sentence adverb' ye3 (= also, as well) - assuming ye3 cannot be analysed as an intra-sentential conjunction - or, possibly, you4….you4 (= 'both … and…/not only… but also…', provided the surface 'coordinates' are phrasal, not clausal). All other choices, as far as I know, have non-truth-functional (e.g., temporal, concessive, causal,...etc.) implications (e.g., ránhòu = 'and then', háishi = 'nevertheless', 'still', suo3yi3 = 'so', 'as a consequence', etc.), and, to that extent, they 'say' (and imply) more than English and in the examples above. Since my knowledge of Mandarin is only elementary, there may well be even gross factual inaccuracies in the discussion above, but they do not worry me too much, as I expect any factual errors of mine will be immediately corrected by the specialists in Mandarin in this forum. That quick, and necessarily selective, discussion was included here only as an example of the way you could yourself proceed to answer your own question in a systematic way: the real point I wished to make above is just that, provided you look not only at 'surface' syntax, but also to 'semantics'/'logical form', English and and with, as well as Mandarin hé, yu3, gen1 and ye3, yòu...yòu, etc., or even a universal & function and a (possibly) universal C function can, indeed, be easily distinguished. Typological distinctions between and-languages and with-languages in cases of [NP & NP] coordination, on the contrary, in spite of all the nice maps, etc., may not suffice for that purpose unless a 'deep' semantic/LF analysis of all the relevant examples has been carried out before positing such language types. I am no typologist, though, and I do not know whether that has been the case or not, so please do not interpret me as saying anything against typological studies; on the contrary, they are the only way to approach questions like yours, but they must include deep semantic (LF) analysis, not just inspection and comparison of 'surface' syntactic structures. 

Since these lexical items form their plural with -s, they are easily classified as nominals. The -s condition is sufficient. Another criterion that one might employ and view as sufficient is the ability to be introduced by the definite article the or the indefinite article a. If one takes this criterion as sufficient then laughing, and first above are definitely nominals. But there are of course numerous expressions that have the distribution of typical nouns (necessary condition), but that one has difficulty classifying as a nominal based upon morphological criteria (sufficient condition). As Adam points out, gerunds are a good example. Gerunds have the distribution of nominals and they can be introduced by an article, but they do not take plural -s, e.g. **the laughings*, **the discussings*, etc. Thus whether or not one classifies gerunds as nominals is going to depend on which criteria one takes to be more important. My stance takes gerunds to be a separate category that straddles two other categories. Gerunds are nominals with respect to their head but verbs with respect to their dependents. In the big picture, each grammarian will decide for him- or herself which criteria are most pertinent for classifying lexical items. I think there is therefore variability in how exactly the term nominal is employed. 

Human speech is noisy, and speech recognition must be able to find patterns in the noise. Phones have a series of articulatory attributes: places and manners of articulation, tongue shape, etc.; which cause voice resonance and distortion. All of those variables are continuous, and a continuous change in one of these parameters produces a continuous change in the produced phone. There's a spectrum of sounds between [a] and [i], for example. Different languages make different distinctions between sounds, and some attributes are more important than others. For example, the distinction between voiced stops and voiced fricatives is significant in English but not in Spanish; similarly, the distinction between plain and aspirated among voiceless stops is significant in Hindi but not in English. So yes, it's a subjective distinction. Also, not every English speaker pronounces yes and no the same way. There's a general pattern that makes a yes or no word recognizable, and a system could be trained to recognize these distinctions. On its most basic form, you only need to be able to recognize "yes" and "no" from everything else, including ambient noise and other words. In fact, this might be a much easier problem to solve than a general speech recognition system, since you don't need to tell "no" from "know" (a context-dependent distinction) or lone "yes" from "YESterday". You still need to be able to recognize the "yes" and "no" said speakers other than yourself, and that will require training your system with a decent amount of speech recordings. 

I suspect that the internal VP structure that Carnie presents in (28) corresponds to an early 1990's analysis of the 'event structure' of active VPs according to which such verbs contain an abstract ('do-like') 'active' component which is absent in the case of verbs describing non-agentive events (e.g., 'processes' like rain, bare 'change of state' verbs like die, or non-active 'accomplishment' verbs like reach in reach the summit, etc.). The basic idea is that the Agent of active verbs like eat is projected as a specifier of that [ACT] V head (i.e., under VP1) - instead of as a specifier of eat itself (under VP2) - or, more intuitively, that eat is the surface manifestation of a complex predicate meaning 'do eat' or 'perform an eating act'. Although that analysis immediately raises difficult theoretical questions like what, then, if anything, occupies the specifier of eat under VP2, or, if he is indeed first projected as the Spec of eat under VP2, what kind of thematic role it receives from eat and how can it subsequently raise into the specifier of the 'do-like' V under VP1 and receive a second? theta role (i.e., that of Agent) there, and why is that compatible with the Theta Criterion, etc., the fact is that there is some empirical evidence in support of that analysis. Pairs like * What you didn't was educate your son properly vs. What you did´t do was educate your son properly show that there is a do verb 'hidden' under active verbs that is different from the 'dummy' do auxiliary and shows up only in such contexts. The fact that non-agentive verbs like die, see, etc. cannot be used in that construction (cf. * What he didn´t do was die/see the accident) suggests that they do not 'contain' such a hidden 'active' do verb and therefore lends support to abstract analyses like Carnie's (initially due to Hale & Keyser, if I remember correctly, but very popular in the late 1990's; see e.g. Malka Rappaport Hovav & Beth Levin's influential 1998 paper 'Building Verb Meanings').
