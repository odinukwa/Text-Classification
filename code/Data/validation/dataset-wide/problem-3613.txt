I've been having a hard time increasing my protein intake. I live in a university dormitory where we are not allowed to cook. Cafeterias don't offer a lot of healthy options either (I'm from the Philippines, by the way, and Filipino food is usually loaded with grease). On the other hand, I am also lactose intolerant, has GERD and possibly IBS. I have tried various brands of whey protein before, including those with whey protein isolate as main ingredient but I tend to become bloated after taking them. One thing that doesn't upset my stomach are eggs. Then I learned that there is such a thing as egg white powder (the kind used in baking) and it's pretty cheap. A kilo (~2.2lbs) costs only PhP1000 (~US$22), more than half the price of most whey protein sold here. My questions are as follows: 

I have mild scoliosis and have been told by every doctor I've spoken with to avoid lifting anything heavy. On the other hand, I've met a number of people who have scoliosis and have succeeded in bodybuilding. If anything, they said, their condition made them extra careful, specially when it comes to exercises such as deadlifts and squats. What is really the scientific consensus when it comes to lifting for people with scoliosis (assuming that the advice I got for the three doctors I spoke with does not represent the general opinion of the medical field)? 

Now the 3rd session is what I am thinking about. Shall I make it a sprint training with spike shoes on? Will it work good? If yes what regime shall I follow? If not what should I do in that session? If required I can cut one swim session and make it a run session. Please comment if more info needed from my side. 

I have got access to a pair of kettlebells (12 & 16 kg). Can anyone please let me know what are the target muscles while swinging? I hope they workout the gluteus and the hamstring. 

I am currently training for marathons (half & full) coming up in quick successions. My best is 1 hr 44 min for a half marathon. I haven't attempted the full marathon yet. But I have got the endurance to do it because I have done up to 3/4 Ironman. Right now I am doing only one HIIT session in a week. I do up to 5 cardios (mainly running, sometimes cycling) in a week. I strengthen my muscles (calisthenics or using resistance ropes) before or after every cardio session. In the HIIT, I warm up (jog, 900 - 1000 m) for 5 minutes. Sprint 200 m in 35 s & jog 200 m in 70 - 80 s and I repeat them 4 or 5 times. Then again cool down jog (800 m - 1000 m) for another 5 min. Now my question is how many times can I do this in a week? If I use the HIIT (eg: Tabata Protocol) for strengthening, not the same day as HIIT run schedule, is that considered as a separate HIIT session? Keeping in mind the recovery run schedules(0 - 1 session after the HIIT) and the Long distance schedules (I do once a week), can anyone guide me? By the way my age is 25. My resting heart rate ranges between 55 and 60. 

I have seen very good results with this routine (I'm fairly certain it is quite a common plan) but lately I haven been reading a lot about doing chest and back on the same day. I'm considering changing my routine to: 

I have on several occasions taken an extended break from the gym for various reasons. When I return, I find it hard to continue my workouts (even at a lower weight) for about 2-3 weeks. Muscles take longer to recover for that period (e.g. they will be very sore for more days than usual) and starting to lift weights again for the first couple of days has on occasion even made me vomit afterwards. I also find it hard to complete the full workout that I would have done before and end up skipping a couple workouts because of muscle pain / inability to continue using them effectively. With limited time (let's say 20-30 minutes 3 times per week) and mostly my own body to use, is there a way I can retain my tolerance to weightlifting so that when I return to the gym, my muscles will recover as they were and I won't feel unwell after the first few sessions? Note: Obviously I will need to work back up to the weight I was using, I don't go back after 2 months and try to lift the same weight I was on. 

After breaking my resistance rope, I thought I will give my own version too. I bought this product some 5 months ago. Yesterday, while sitting on a 2 feet wall and performing a shoulder exercise, the red rope (level 3 rope) broke. Not much of an injury except for a little bruises on hand & feet. I would have stretched the rope to some 10 feet approx. After having regularly used the rope for some 5 months, it could have had some wear and tear. So, I recommend people to buy resistance ropes, only after knowing the stretch or elastic limit. If they aren't mentioned anywhere on the product, please don't buy. While exercising, it may lead to severe injury. You may even lose an eye. Beware! 

I am going to participate in a half marathon in the 1st week of July and 3/4 Ironman in the 2nd week of July. I am training 11 sessions a week. 8 sessions of swimming with lot of floor exercises before it. 3 sessions of running. Let us not bother about my cycling for now. Out of the 3 sessions of running, one is Interval training 

Sometimes when I'm at the gym, I am not motivated enough or I don't feel energetic enough to really push myself and force myself to really struggle with those last 2-3 reps in each set. Times like these I'll find myself sticking to what I can complete 3x10 in pretty comfortably, needing moderate effort in the last set but always being able to complete it. With the goal of putting on size - is there still going to be a benefit in weightlifting if I'm not pushing myself to my limits? I know for example with strength training that you really need to push yourself and be consistently increasing your lifting weight to make strength gains, but I'm not sure if the same applies to a goal of muscle mass gains. I am of course sticking pretty close to edge of struggling (I'm not just doing a low weight that requires no effort whatsoever), I just find often that I'm not adding that extra 3, 4 or 5 kgs to make it difficult for myself. It's probably important to note that I like to stay just under my lifting capacity to allow slower movements and perfected form as well. I feel like form and slower movements would be preferred over quick jerky movements with more weight, but I could be wrong considering I see a lot of big guys at the gym doing this. 

Recently I have been training hard for my marathons and I feel that it may not be enough to become a champion. So I came up with the idea of carrying weight while running. I have got 2 dumbbells each weighing just 4 lbs. Can I carry these on my hand and swing my arms normally, the way in which I do while jogging? Will this improve my strength and/or my speed? Also please tell me, what is the extent of weight that I can carry, if at all this idea is good? 

Previously I had asked about carrying hand weights while running. Can we pull weights while running? Tie a rope to our hip and the weight. I am planning to run on the beach sand nearby. My question is, is there any use in doing this? Will I improve my speed or my strength or both? 

Enjoy running Edit My understanding on heart rate and interval training: Resting heart rate is calculated by counting the pulse rate or heart rate after you lie down for half hour or so. Your maximum heart rate is approximately 220 - age. The difference between max and resting heart rate is taken as diff for further calculations. Generally long runs are run at a heart rate between 50 to 60% (resting heart rate + 50-60% of diff)comfortably. If the this percent is close to the max heart rate then the person will get tired soon. So the resting rate is to be reduced in order to reach greater speeds with ease, for long runs. For a normal man the resting heart rate is 72 bpm (beats per min). In order to reduce the resting heart rate, one does interval training, during which the heart rate is pushed close to the max heart rate (or held near the threshold limit for a long time) while sprinting (fast runs) and reduced to very low rate (as low as possible) during the resting period (or slow jog). This kind of subsequent peaking and reducing heart rate, results in lot of fat burning and over course of time reduces the resting heart rate. Thus the above method of intervals reduces resting heart rate and allows us to run fast for a long period of time (distance).
