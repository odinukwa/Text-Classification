No. The universe does not "follow" any laws of physics, there is no source code to be rewritten. No "decisions" are made as in a computer program. Humans have observed matter and deduced, for themselves, patterns of how matter behaves. Then humans captured a description of these patterns using mathematics to describe them. However, the universe does not care how it is described, it is not consulting a rule book, it is not executing code to decide what to do or how to behave, electromagnetic repulsion is what it is, everywhere it is, there is no master rule somewhere that "governs" it, no master variable to change. The universe is a thing. We can write a very detailed description of how it works, what you think are rules of the universe are all just predicting what will happen, under various circumstances, they are not determining what will happen. What determines what will happen, and what we are describing, is inherent in the energy, gravity and configuration of mass at every point in space. We don't have a good description about how all that works, modern physics is incomplete and riddled with a dozen major problems. But whatever they are, no matter how smart we are or an AI can possibly become, it cannot change every particle in the universe just by knowing something. It might develop a better understanding of the laws of physics, that it could then exploit to do something we humans did not think possible, but that would not be rewriting them. 

Yes, all of that is possible, given a mutation affecting the brain (in Planet of the Apes the mutation was induced by genetic engineering into an ape). The body forms do not make a difference, all that matters is a brain that can solve problems like people do. None of the common things people tell you are necessary are actually necessary: They don't need opposable thumbs, they don't need to walk upright, they don't need particular biological features of humans. Chimps and gorillas already make tools and have been known to use weapons like rocks and sticks. The only unique thing about humans is our mental life, the ability to plan more than a few hours in advance, to model physics and behavior, to think abstractly and recursively. Only the human brain, to our knowledge, can make a plan that will take years and thousands of people and will actually work (e.g. to make a pyramid, divert a river, build a city). The evidence we have thus far is scant, but this ability appears to have been due to a singular mutation that occurred perhaps 200,000 years ago, by chance. It would spread like wildfire, especially once passed along to a male: As the only smart ape in the world they would be able to mate more or less at will and defeat all rivals with very simple plans. The odds of a mutation like that occurring again, but in a modern ape, are slim but not impossible. However, genetically engineering an ape to have a human brain is entirely plausible, putting motivations for doing so aside. 4) Humans can live naked in the wild and in trees without a problem and easily. Some do already. To remain there instead of building villages, shelters, traps, boats, etc, you would have to make them brain damaged in some way. Otherwise their human intellect will work every day to make their life take less work, be less dangerous, to invent weapons, to store calories in some way to be less dependent on the vagaries of nature, etc. 

Many animals begin tool-making without free limbs. Dolphins use found objects (including sponges and shells) held in their mouth to scrape the ocean bottom (in relatively shallow waters) disturbing burrowing creatures that jump up; then they drop their tool and eat them. A mahout (elephant handler) working with his animal to clear out dead forest trees reports that after pushing down one tree, a branch fell on the elephant's back; almost striking him (the mahout) too. Without prompting, the elephant stopped, tore branches from another tree, and propped the log between its trunk and tusks; extending well above its head and across its back. The elephant carried the log with it to new trees, deflecting many dead branches during the day. Corvids (Crows, other large birds in the family) routinely construct many varied tools using only their beak and feet. They also seem to understand some of the tools of humans: One ice fisher (human) had a particular ice hole that he never caught any fish in, even when his other holes were producing a few fish every day. He set up a camera to film the hole; and sure enough, after some hours of film he saw the line moving. So, apparently, did a crow, because within minutes it landed near the hole; grabbed the line with its feet and began pulling away, flapping its wings; and eventually pulled a fish out. Not only that, but the crow spend several minutes after the fish expired extracting the hook from its mouth; and when it finally did that, put the hook and line back in the hole. Perhaps to catch another fish, or perhaps to conceal its presence (Corvids are known to engage in deceptive and cover-up behaviors with their own kind). One of my cats, as a kitten, would spend many minutes on its back, even falling asleep that way, batting at tassles on the kitchen curtains with its front paws. Your animals, if they need both hands to fashion something, could do the same: Don't get hung up on the human posture of crouching over something and working on it; that is just body-mechanics for us. If they do something, they will use their own body mechanics; I can easily see them doing something on their back, in the air, like braiding hair into rope, weaving, carving wood with flint, etc. For operations requiring a "gravity assist" so pieces fall away; just move the arms to the side. Or, they could obviously stand up like my dog or cat; so give them a table chest-high in the standing position so they can rest their elbows on it and manipulate something on it. The same goes for their sitting position; they can sit and prop their front elbows on a platform. Note they do not have to build a table to discover this is a comfortable position for, say, knapping flint: Just encounter a natural flat rock of the correct height; and then reproduce that idea with found rocks; or logs, or cut a section of tree trunk so the length is the right height, carved pretty flat on both ends; then turn it 90 degrees. You have a flat round table. Slightly higher tech in the next few hundred years and they will be building tables from lumber; using the Mortise and Tenon method with animal-derived glues, as humans have been doing for at least 7000 years, and 4000 years before the iron age. They can find body positions, slings, tables and chairs to free up their front legs and hands. Birds can stand on one foot and use the other to hold things they are constructing with their beak, like a termite spear. It is misguided foolishness to think opposable thumbs are needed (dolphins, octopi and elephants don't need them, crows build a few tools using only their beak), or to think that free limbs must be always free. What is needed is intelligence and self-awareness, once those exists the animal will find a way to use its body to turn objects into tools. added: Watching my cat; he sometimes lies on the floor and plays with a toy using both his front paws and his mouth; his furry elbows slide easily on the smooth wood floor with no trouble. Also, I note that I sit most of my work day in a chair that actually holds my body in a comfortable position I couldn't possibly hold for more than a few seconds without the chair; thus an unnatural position without a support mechanism. Trying to think similarly for a cat-like creature; all that is needed is to remove the need for the front arms to support the body: The "chair" for that would be something like a bench it could rest its chest upon, that supported its body. Perhaps most of it; like our chairs support all of our weight but leave our feet touching the ground (for most). A more sophisticated and comfortable version of that for your creature would be an angled bench-like padded cradle; supporting about from the armpit area back to the bottom of the rib-cage, high enough to support almost all the body weight and leave the back haunches in a natural crouch position; and leaving their belly and genitalia uncompressed. The support would allow them the free use of their arms, hands, and head: They could assemble things, write, look through microscopes, and do anything we do in chairs. Like our own furniture; the cat chair would be low enough so that if they just stood up they would clear it by a few inches so could back away from it; it would be as easy for them to get into and out of as our own chairs.
