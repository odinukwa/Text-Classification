During the Punic Wars, the Macedonians allied themselves with the Carthaginians with the expectation they would be the victors of the war and therefore be on good terms with them in the future. In order to cement this, the Macedonian–Carthaginian Treaty was signed in 215 BC as recorded by Livy. 

(image source) From what i have read, the Romans never conquered Hatra yet the monuments are disinctly Hellenistic in design. Was it built by the Seleucids? 

Gaius Gracchus's reforms in 123BC saw the introduction of the practice of Tax Farming were the burden of tax collection was reassigned by the Roman State to private individuals or groups known as Publicani. 

After the Great Turkish War of 1683 - 1699, the Ottomans built a small mosque in the ruined Parthenon using salvaged materials from Parthenon itself. This was after it was catastrophically damaged by a gunpowder explosion in 1687. Here are two depictions of the mosque inside the Parthenon and then one without it: Early 1830's 

Hieronymus Wolf was the earliest known historian to use the name of the Byzantine Empire's capital to refer to the empire itself. As far as we know, there where no other "ulterior motives" other than to simply distinguish between an empire in two different stages of history. In the eyes of historians, the Empire was always named after its capital city. So since the Roman Empire was without Rome for a great part of its history, the name of its later capital was used to replace it. Other terms for the Byzantine Empire, particularly "The Greek Empire" or "Empire of the Greeks" (Imperium Graecorum) was used by 19th century historians interchangeably with "Byzantine Empire" where appropriate. Mostly when highlighting the ethnic or linguistic differences between the Byzantine Empire and its western neighbours. One notable historian who used "The Greek Empire" was George Finlay. As for Gibbon, like other classicists he was not too fond of the Byzantine Empire. He saw it as a betrayal of everything that ancient Rome and Greece stood for. (see Norwich). Although still accepting Byzantium as a continuation of the Roman empire, he is well known for trying to distance his ideal Roman Empire from that of "barbaric" Byzantium by highlighting key differences. Differences which were the cause of the Empires downfall. He did not however promote "Byzantium" as an alternative to "Roman" as such practices by his time where already widespread in western Europe. In summary, the use of the term "Byzantine" came naturally and spread through Europe over time as a way for historians to conveniently distinguish the later history of the Roman Empire to its early history. The negative connotations associated with the term came much later. This book goes significant detail of the reception of Byzantium in western europe after its fall. I have not read it but it might be worth a shot. 

(source) It has been suggested that the Publicani used a primitive system of credits and debits to transfer tax revenues back to the Aerarium. Several ancient writers have recorded this practice and referred to it as Permutatio. Cicero for example, used a Permutatio while governing Cilicia to send funds to Athens. It is not clear, how widespread this practice was. Other systems of credit transfer or cash-less transfers such as Nomina, Syngraphae may have been used to send revenues back to Rome. (source) Such systems reduced drastically the requirement for the physical transfer of cash which could have been expensive and dangerous in itself. In such cases, cash was transferred in the form of bullion or in actual coin. It is also possible that tax money from a particular province was generated by selling goods aquired through tax farming. In such cases, the Publicani would ship their saleable goods to Italy where the profits of sale would be then physically transferred to Rome. 

The accounts of the destruction of the temple are a little confusing. Jordanes in the 6th century says 

It was a combination of both. Alexander the Great encouraged the spread of Greek culture as noted by Plutarch in his work On the Fortunes of Alexander: 

The Greek government had placed no restrictions on religious conversions via marriage or baptism in the same fashion that the Turkish government did. Last minute conversions to prevent deportation were allowed and this applied to both men and women. It is unclear if there were specific rules for women Here is an example of marriages occurring in Crete in order to prevent evacuation: 

I'll add a few extra details which may be of use to you since the scope of the question now seems to include events outside the Peloponnesian war of 431–404 BC Persian gold was said to have made its way into the hands of the prominent Athenian orator and statesmen Demosthenes, who led the opposition forces against Phillip of Macedon and other Pan-Hellenists of his time. It was said that this gold was the main motivator for his staunch opposition to the proponents of a united Hellenic faction. Aeschines accuses Demosthenes himself of accepting 70 talents from the Persian king after the state of Athens refused 300 in financing a revolt against the Macedonians: 

-The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the 6th century to the Late Twelfth century (p37) by John V. A. Fine, JR Bear in mind that Macedonia was not the only region in Europe in such a situation and the concept of ethnicity was not so well defined back then as it is now. People identifying with a distinct ethnic Macedonian identity separate from Bulgarians or Serbians first appeared in the 19th century. From wikipedia: 

The carrying out of a Macedonian-Carthaginian alliance was heavily promoted by the court councilor Demetrius of Pharos who had been the last ruler of Illyria before the Romans defeated him in 229BC. Demetrius according to Polybius had much influence on the Macedonian king and urged him to invade Illyria to re-establish him since the Carthaginians had been defeated. Demetrius has been recorded saying to Philip V: 

We know that the ancient Greeks worshiped the Olympian Gods and their descendants but what about the Titans? did the ancient Greeks ever worship the Titans such as Cronos, Okeanos, Rhea and Hyperion? If not, why? where there any legends of Greeks been punished for worshiping the Titans? If so, how did the Greeks worship them? did they build temples in their honour?
