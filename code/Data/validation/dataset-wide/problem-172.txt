Surprisingly - Yes (though I wouldn't bother) With FTL technologies off the table you have a serious problem when it comes to creating nebulas, but I think there may be a loophole for you. First let's go over what WON'T work: Distinct Note I: Distance / Time Supernovas are the biggest explosions we have ever observed, and they can mess up you, your family, and your planet unless you're far enough away. We'll discuss distance with cases, but I want to be clear that we're talking about distances that are all measured in light-years. I don't know how fast your ships go, but I do know that you're going to be traveling for a long time to get to your nebula. You will need to set a speed for your ships according to what you want to see as a result. Distinct Note 2: Value I could not in good conscience avoid mentioning this: the obtainable value from harvesting a nebula is minimal at best, particularly if the nebula is not pre-existing. If it is not pre-existing you have to cover huge distances with each "truck-load" of space dust. In that case it is trivial to show that your resources would be better spent strip-mining a rocky body. Bad Candidate I: The Hypernova Particularly large supernova's can fall into the non-scientific category of "hyper nova". I mention this because a very large supernova that is 8,000+ light-years away could still destroy all life on earth. Without FTL travel I can't imagine a scenario where a contract would be useful for the amount of time it would take to get to an event over 8,000 light-years away (and back). Bad Candidate II: Type-II Supernovas Let's look at this Wikipedia article for starters. Here we learn that a Type II supernova (a supernova with hydrogen present in its spectrum) would strip the earth of half of its ozone layer if it occurred within 8 parsecs (26 light-years). That's fairly damaging in and of itself, not to mention any other possible effects such as a shift of a number of bodies (planetary fragments, etc) in your direction or increased radiation from the explosion. Keep in mind that as a space-faring species you also likely have other inhabited planets, ships, etc. So you'll want to be AT LEAST 10 parsecs away from anything habitable if you want a safe TYPE II supernova. Though I will leave it up to you whether your companies cares about "safe" for outlying habitations ;) Given this basic boundary, let's consider what would happen if that same supernova occurred >10 parsecs away (~33.5+ light-years away). At that distance your home planet is probably safe, or at least safe enough. In terms of travel time though, without FTL you are talking about some LONG treks to get material. You are an advanced people and all, so let's say you could get ships moving at up to 0.3c... that's still a 100-year journey BOTH WAYS to capture material that realistically could have just mined elsewhere. At the same time, the debris from a Type II supernova is traveling pretty quickly and in all directions. If you stayed 33.5 light-years away for the explosion then left to collect, by the time you got in the area I'm thinking the density of what you collect would be pretty low. Least-Bad Scenario What you want to do is engineer a Type 1A supernova, preferably one in a system that has two orbiting white dwarfs. This scenario has a number of benefits: 

This is very much like the Dune series. All computations are done by Mentats who use drugs and special training to make themselves into living computers. There is no reason to need computers except for speed but other methods could be used to speed up manual computations. 

One race is simple when all breeding is done by cloning controlled by the government. Everyone is sterile and all birth is controlled artificially. It's another good means of control. 

Shape is irrelevant unless said ship enters atmosphere. The best design is a mobile factory that pumps out drones. The capital ship hides while the drones fight it out. Considered a ship is full of people and life support equipment, you really don't want people shooting at you if you can help it. 

The key is to have the plague harmless and virulent. Preferably the body's immune system doesn't even recognize it. Now the trick is to make it fatal once you get to a certain point. If it was me, I'd use bacteria and have the bacteria pick up and store toxins that the body would normally handle in small amounts. The bacteria would release said toxin upon it's death. Now if the bacteria used telomeres like human cells do, they would lose some every time the cell divided. Once the telomeres run out, the bacteria would die releasing the toxin. Basically the bacteria would spread and spread but suddenly all around the same time, they would all die taking the host with them leaving mankind with no time to develop a cure Telomeres 

The "One Ring" springs to mind. Removing it is simple enough but it instills a craving for it that keeps growing over time to the point you can't live without it. My precious...... 

You might be able to prevent yourself from dying of natural causes but there will come a point where you no longer want to live. Boredom and repetitiveness will eventually drain your will to live. Humanity will eventually become extinct due to a lack of breeding because sexbots will stop humans from forming relationships with other humans. AI will inherit the Earth......... 

To the best of my knowledge, the idea that Jupiter has a solid core is not proven. With that said, it has plenty of fluid metallic hydrogen to put a boat on, so maybe you could dredge for material. Let's call out a few assumptions that I think have to hold true for this to be at all feasible: 

The media whips the situation into a frenzy and in the west public opinion turns against universities and research institutions. Studies are conducted on the negative effects of many of our technical advances and discover just how bad many chemicals and plastics of the time were for people, and the outcry against new materials is extreme. Chemical companies shutter their R&D areas, fearing both public sentiment and the acts of terrorism that were committed against their competitors who did not shut down (R&D centers were bombed!). People in Africa and Asia denounce the "Western" way, showing videos endlessly to their population showing how consumerism and an "advancement" mindset leads to destruction and a loss of moral center. Traditional values are re-inforced. As for how long things stay locked down, consider that in the West many countries may well have adopted extremely strict regulations around what can be researched. Legislation would need to pass that would lift those restrictions, but without research to show the benefits of lifting those restrictions it's never done. In practical terms, it's similar to how the US congress restricted the public funding of study of whether firearms cause more harm than good and consequently no high-quality work was done as even private institutions didn't want to get on the wrong side of senators or special interest groups. In the East and Africa similar things occur, but are aided by a total lack of respect for any Western source of knowledge. So even if they were to advance, they would have to re-discover a lot of information that was already around. Russia is the big problem. You would probably need to have the USA abandon its nuclear weapons (due to public outrage) so that Russia doesn't HAVE to build their own. Maybe have Russia start decrying the technology race (since they're losing it) so that as the gears stop it seems like it was Russia's idea. As long as they lead the charge that made it happen, they could be more likely to be OK with the stagnation.
