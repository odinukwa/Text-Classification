Now lets consider a base'class' of fighters. Traditional 'space opera' fleets are heavily inspired by ww2 and older naval fleets. You had large command vessels with manned fighters for defence. You had 'hero' fighter pilots capable of taking on capital vessels with snub fighters... which is a bit silly. Lets start by considering point defence and ECM. Your average fighter from movies would be shredded to bits by a capital ship. You'd probably go for extreme maneuverability, maximum annoyance and the realisation that you're probably better off letting the big boys duke it out. Outside the cockpit, the starfury design from Christopher Schank's answer and B5 makes sense. it would also make a good base design for something that could work as a drone fighter as well. Have them work in teams of say 3-5 with one command fighter with a pilot (or none, depending on your ECM environment, and AI quality). You might also want something with a little more firepower. Part of me thinks a 'tug' pulling containers of self contained missile pods makes a lot of sense. Yes... an space train! There's an alternate school of thought there - having a central pod (say, our bath-tub of death) detachable trusses, and weapons pods off them. While it does make out hypothetical 'heavy' fighter have a high aspect ratio, trusses are expendable, and might draw fire. If you want to take on capital ships, you'd probably want bombers. Or suicide-drones based off the same basic design. Have some explode and fill the area with chaff or shrapnel, others just dumb mass designed to punch through or just knock off course, and some explosives. If your enemy dosen't know which ones are the command fighters, or which ones are the decoys, its even better. A smart hypothetical space fighter to me would be a small fireteam against other fighters, and the equivilent of a horde of rabid toddlers to a capital ship. 

While teleoperation would be ideal, considering the ranges in space, and that there's no air resistance, and gravity might be a bit more complicated, you're better off sticking them in an armoured bathtub (tm), forget the windows, and just control everything over goggles. Glass cockpits are only useful for knife flighting range. 

Most modern weapon systems are modular to some extent for ease of maintenance. Its not just about weapons though. A modular powerpack means a faulty unit could be swapped out with nothing more than a crane and put the weapon system back in order. With a hybrid/semi hybrid design for a power plant, you might swap out a powerplant with one more suitable for another role. Having a single, multirole platform also means spares commonality (Your tank killer's transmission broken? Grab spares from your AA platform that's got balky fire control). That said there's a certain lack of flexibility. Some platforms tend to do ok for purposes they were never designed for. The m113, while designed as your standard can of infantry is a good example of that. That said, it has barely any armour, and wouldn't do as well as say, a MBT. You could turn a MBT into a APC though which might be a decent idea. Have a standard base design - have the APC as the base model - have large, standard compartments for Motorised infantry, communications or ammunition. Have different turrets for tank, AT missile or SAM pods.Significant commonality in parts, better logistics. Problems? You can't 'simply' swap out turrets as needed. You will need to retrain your crews, or cross train them. Some roles may be swappable (drivers) others may not. You'd also not have vehicles perfect for every situation. Need a light tank that will fit into a airplane? Having a MBT wouldn't help. Need something tough? A light tank or a thin shelled APC base would not help. 

Depends where you're fighting. The original tank concept was designed during world war one as a way to counteract trenches. The modern tank to a large extent was designed around conventional warfare of the sort that was projected towards the end of the cold war. That said, most modern wars seem to be fought in urban or post urban areas. Rather than an electric Abrams, a different sort of armoured vehicle might make sense. Lets start with the issues of a electrical tank - You would have limited range, need to spend time recharging it (and that electricity needs fuel anyway) and the energy density of batteries is a bit naff. The tesla S has a range of say 500km. Assuming the same range, you're basically limited to staging areas roughly 250km or less. Modern Lithium Batteries are also gloriously inflammable. Its actually pretty hard to set diesel or even petrol alight. Tanks are also much bigger vehicles, with a less efficient drive system (even if treads have their own advantages), That said, we have modern fighting vehicles that run off electricity anyway - submarines. And many of them use a combination of fossil fuels and batteries. A hybrid tank might have the option of using batteries, topping them off with periodically run, smaller engines, and use electrical motors for a simplified drive train. That said, the modern MBT isn't really the best sort of vehicle for urban combat. They might make good command vehicles but many modern armed forces are moving off it. Now a swarm of technical type vehicles, completely noiseless until they start firing... that would be scary. 

Carefully bred leeches - They have anti coagulants in their saliva which would keep the blood fluid, and to a certain extend, fresh. They're well known in medival times, and often feature in literature of the era in use in medicine. Something like the common leeches used in medicine could either be processed, or bigger leeches used to draw and possibly even store blood. 

You need an event. Maybe your party gets hired by a goblin chief to protect them from slavers. If folks discover an 'animal' is suddenly sentient and can communicate in a way we humans can understand, that changes a lot. 

Nothing that would really work - as per bob's excellent comment, there's a list of reserved, example TLDs, none of which are suitable and the new gTLDs are pretty broad. There's nothing stopping a organisation with a justification and enough money from registring any new gTLD. Its worth considering the rich and varied tradition of making things up when talking about computers in media, from interfaces to websites. As such the 'clever' way would be to introduce some slight, subtle inconsistancy. 555 was picked so it wouldn't route to any phone number You could simply pick a branch of the multiverse where things went differently, colons instead of dots, or even having your network as one large set of directories. So the office of the imperitor general of the imperial sanitation department might be at spqr/sanitation/org/official/imperitor. This would break in any modern web browser and would be consistant. Or just gloss it over and tell, don't show. 

Just have a general purpose "carrier fluid" - acting as fuel for a fuel cell, lubrication, coolant/waste movement, and hydraulic fluid. You could even have it conductive for "liquid"/"microfluidic" circuits. This would greatly simplify logistics - since you would only need to stock a single type of fluid, and dump and change that periodically as needed. You can handwave any characteristics you need (like hardening in oxygen in the absence of some inhibitor to be self sealing) on top of that. 

You could do a reverse Potemkin Essentially build a giant, barren desert set around the gate. Bury everything in the area underground, cover the whole lot with sand of some boring, low value material. Probe comes out, sees nothing but a darned large amount of worthless dust, and leaves. Anything of value would be further out, or in extremely deep, underground monitoring stations. Spreading word of how damn inhospitable the planet was, and stories of expeditions dying of boredom, heat or going broke would further discourage travellers, as would any expedition going out claiming to be unsucessful expeditions going home after trying to find something there. 

As with anything in fiction there's a few decent modern examples of this. Brazillia, Chandigarth and Naypidaw would be good starting points for inspiration, quite interestingly, especially the last, and most recent of these, Naypidaw, since very little differentiates a modern military junta, from a feudal state There's a few things worth considering - while a modern planned city would have a grid layout, I'd suspect multiple hubs and spokes, centering around the city's temporal and spiritual centers of power makes sense. In a monothestic culture, you might have a seat of spiritual power (or a 'quarter' or at least a street of these in a multireligious culture.) You'd have a palace (for a king or local aristrocracy) probably surrounded by facilities for visiting nobility, or the court. You'd probably have areas for tradesmen (or maybe even streets dedicated to trade). You'd probably have lower density in the 'rich' district, with outlying, poorer districts being more packed. While it wouldn't be planned, you'd probably have a less reputable area - this might be an older quarter (or one planned for a less popular trade) - traditionally this would be the docks (and having a city straddle a river is picturesque, especially if the river is fed by a spring, and that's right smack in your local defensive fortress ). Try putting palaces and other important things on top of hills (the romans LOVED that), though plains wouldn't do too badly for large sprawling palaces. Don't forget, the joys of being a absolute ruler is urban renewal is easy. You can likely reconfigure a city however you wish, as long as you don't piss off too many people at once. If all else fails, fires happen. 

Metal is meh. Least as far as armour goes. Composites are probably far more useful, and yes, you could make decent composites with horse glue and cloth. There's a few possibilities for useful, exotic materials that would have been available to medieval folk, either in conjunction with or instead of regular materials. Layered fabrics with glue in between would likely have been useful against stabbing and slashing weapons. While the variant that came to mind was the greek linothorax. However while the greeks used linen, silk might be a useful fabric here - done correctly its bulletproof and the mongols used it as part of their armour. I'd suspect rather than a single material, a mix of materials and layered armour, would work well. If we wanted to go a little nuts, maybe domesticated spiders for super strong silk. As for weapons, once again, there's interesting options that are not metal. Obsidian made good sharp blades, and I suspect that whole glassworking wasn't quite to modern standards, even crappyish glass could be sharpened into something stabby or slashy, maybe used like the a Macuahuitl or Tepoztopilli 

Its the Hindustan motors ambassador. I'll carry 6 people through the worst roads India can offer. You would probably want to go for a dual fuel conversion, running off either CNG (so you can scrounge a standard gas cylinder) or petrol. As for armour? Rebar or rebar mesh sounds good, though if you could find yourself a decent workship and have the time. A cow catcher sounds good. I'd think cast iron "dosai kal" or tavas would make improvised bullet proof armour,
