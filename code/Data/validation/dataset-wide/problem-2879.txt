I'm not sure if this will satisfy you, but it's another (rather obvious) way to think about it -- a line is some function the derivative of which is a constant, or the second derivative of which is zero. When you look at the collection of infinitessimal line segments you described earlier, does each one have the same slope -- the same tangent -- as the ones before and after it? I guess the concepts of slope and tangent are also based in the concept of the line, but this still appeals to my intuitions. It's not altogether absurd to call a circle a "line" that is biased towards a center. In this case, every infinitessimal segment follows a pattern set by the one before it, where its "path" changes according to that pattern, that bias towards the center. A "straight" line is one with no such bias -- where every line segment is just a transposition of the last, with no transformation. My ideas are starting to bleed into one another, but I guess that's fine, because it doesn't seem like you're looking for an answer, so much as scratching of an itch. Hope I helped. 

Sorry for the stupid question. But could anyone organize all these names into a logical and concatenated thinking? 

I'm studying logic, but honestly I'm pretty confused. Each book gives a different name or addresses different logics. What are the types of logic? Types I've seen in books (and I can not make links between them): 

So if I clap (TRUE) and there is a clapping noise (TRUE), then I have a TRUE conditional. If I clap (TRUE) and I do not hear a clapping noise (FALSE), then the conditional is FALSE (there is no possibility, in normal conditions, that I clap and the noise does not come out) If I do not clap (FALSE) and hear clapping, the condition is TRUE (I may have just played an audio on my cell phone). If I do not clap (FALSE) and there is no clapping (FALSE), I have a TRUE condition. No cause, no effect. Summing up: 

You have to ask, given your understanding of sociology and given how well you've otherwise arranged society, what the likelihood is that the mass surveillance will be abused at the expense of those worst off. Then, you have to consider what the benefit will be to those worst off. Imagine this from such a perspective, and make the "selfish" choice. Personally, I feel that some version of effective encryption will, from this point forward, always be necessary, even in the most ideal society one can realistically imagine. Until we reach such an ideal society, I think the US Constitution provides pretty good approximations of the boundary line, and that the current extent of US surveillance is unconstitutional. I particularly feel that metadata is more sensitive than judges have yet understood. But, that's all me answering the question as a realist, and I think of Rawlsian philosophy as an idealistic one... I'm not sure how much more surveillance I would abide in a more ideal world, but I think it would be more. 

I am confused about the distinction in everyday language and in propositional logic. I even understand what is logical implication in a complete argument. But in a propositional logic, I do not understand. I developed a way of thinking, I'd like help to identify gaps and clarify the definitions. Conditional I usually apply a causal relationship. 

• One who is not so beginner, and is not afraid to go deeper, knowing how to explain pedagogically. • DO NOT be about the history of philosophy. I have a perfect collection in this style, written by giovanni reale. I would like a book like Reale's, but for topics such as epistemology, ethics, metaphysics and general problems of philosophy. • It is not MUST, but it would help to have a impartial style, but also opinative (Bertrand Russell and the History of Western Philosophy is an example of this: he is quite critical, but tries to pass on the idea of philosophers impartially). Reference books: • I do not know if Reale's books were translated into English, but he wrote a giant collection of History of Philosophy. For me is the best reference, I would like a book like his for themes of philosophy, not history. 

I personally define art as any attempt to be understood. The value of art -- I suppose, the quality -- may be some function of 

I personally define Art as any attempt to be understood. This reflects essentially all writing, rhetoric, painting, and the like. Some of those things involve sentiment, and some do not. An attempt to be understood which does not involve sentiment might include a passage in a math textbook, or a scientific paper (depending on what you consider sentiment to be, and what threshold level of it is relevant). Personally, I feel that expressing a mathematical truth in such a way that it can be understood is art, whether there is sentiment in it or not. Euler's Formula is a rather beautiful piece of art, I would say, and the derivations I have seen inspire me in much the same way as other art does. Your question hinges on how you define art. If you would like a cold mathematical textbook with no sentiment in it to qualify as art, as I do, the answer to your question is "no." If you would not like to consider that art, the answer seems to be "yes," but we still need a definition to see if we can falsify the premise. Try not to use the word "sentiment" in your definition. 

I'm having a hard time to distinguish "necessary and sufficient" in this case. I think it's necessary. For bread to exist, all the above elements are necessary. I also think that is sufficient. Just have these elements that bread comes up. Am I right? 

It is invalid. But it's still syllogism? (I know that may seem obvious, but I see many people just considering the valid syllogisms as syllogism) 

Create a causal relationship to the conditional (like I did), is it correct? How to create a way to understand the logical implication in everyday language? 

Is that correct? It is not only probable that Gabriel's tail is a wolf's tail? He may can have a cat's tail because of a transplant. This conclusion necessarily follows? 

The value of what is to be understood, whether it is a lesson, emotion, or bare fact. Its effectiveness in being understood by its intended audience. This is a tough one, in that I certainly appreciate a lot of music that I can't say I fully understand -- but perhaps the intent was for me to understand an emotion, or the effect of a certain sound or technique... Perhaps there were many intentions, and I have appreciated some but not others. I also know that much great art is written so that it will be misunderstood -- see "The Road Not Taken," or the passage with the "must haves" in "The Great Gatsby." I don't want to say that the quality of the art is a function of its impact, or how much its audience appreciates it. But I'm relatively satisfied with the way I've phrased this -- "its effectiveness in being understood by its intended audience." The uniqueness of that effort -- if I can have an audience understand a message that it could not otherwise easily understand, I may have accomplished something greater than if I had reiterated a thought that my audience already understood. Other factors. I really don't know. I think it's subjective at the end of the day, but if it's a function, it certainly isn't this simple.
