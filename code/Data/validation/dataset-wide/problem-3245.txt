While the size of India and the presence of multi cultural society makes it hard for an armed force to take control of the entire country I think the structure of the Indian army makes it even harder. 

The DoJ published this paper in December 2011 and released prison statistics for 2010. According to the article the number of people in prison at year-end'10 was 7.1 million of which 2,226,800 people were sentenced in 2010 itself [table 1, in that paper]. This wikipedia article also has a lot of detail on this subject. I think you can extrapolate the figures in the DoJ article with the 2011 rates mentioned in the wikipedia article and compute the number of people in Jail in 2011. 

The six articles were adopted by Henry much later (1539) and although the English acts passed hence bear an outward facade of other theological differences, it all started with Henry's Great Matter and therefore it can be said the English Reformation under Henry VIII was mainly motivated by an absolutist drive (even in the mid-late duration of his campaign). The protestant nature of the reformation actually took much shape under Elizabeth I's rule. 

But the sacrifice test had been in use since long before Decius. For more details see this document by de Ste. Croix. It must be kept in mind that in ancient Rome sacrifices were quite common for both personal and imperial purposes. Sacrifice contracts "negotiated" with the Gods were fairly elaborate and would run into pages (or rather scrolls/tablets). Some of these contracts required subjects/citizens to sacrifice regularly for the well being of the army (and later the Princeps --or Caesar). However, there is a link between sacrifices and prosecution of Christians. See Pliny's letter to Trajan for an example. As Pliny's letter indicates, prosecution does not seem to have been driven by the state but by the people --someone had had to be accused before being tried. In practise however one cannot rule out accusations coming from powerful state officials who wanted public approval. The letter also gives us some insight into the trial. The accused was asked to denounce Christ and confirm Roman religion by offering incense and food to the Emperor. As de Ste. Croix outlines --such trials frequently involved sacrificing to the gods (and not necessarily in the emperor's name). But it was not warranted by law and seems to have had been a legal argument to strengthen the accusation. Decius however made sacrifice mandatory with his edict of 250 A.D. 

We all know the immense contribution ancient Roman, medieval Roman (or Byzantine), and pre-modern HRE cannon law has made to the modern world. These empires relied on a written constitution (or code) and trained magistrates, lawyers, and notaries [cf. Judith Herrin, Byzantium: The Surprising Life of a Medieval Empire; Peter H. Wilson, Europe's Tragedy: A New History of the Thirty Years War]. Much of today's European civil law can trace its origin to those cannons and much of our current legal framework (courts, judges, constitution, senate, and lawyers) are a direct copy of their ideas. I know that India also has a long tradition of its own legal principles. For example, we know from John Keay: India --A History that during the Mughal period, the administration was uniform and structured and that there existed courts (known as kotwaalis) and magistrates (or kotwaals) [cf, ]. But how did this law function and how was it administered? Where did it originate --did the Mughals bring it with them or was it indigenous to India? Therefore, I have three three questions for the legal framework in India's ancient period and early middle kingdom period (i.e., 2nd century BCE - 7th century CE): 

The result were the Royal Acts of Supremacy and consequently Henry was free to do as he saw fit (even on religious matters). He annulled his marriage to Catherine and married Anne Boleyn (1533). The religious reformation continued. The King still remained Catholic but questioned many Catholic practices. Many Lutheran and Catholic practices were condemned and adherents of both streams were persecuted systematically (see this for sources) --causing great confusion and debate over the nature of the new English religious order. Although it all started with Henry's Great Matter, which can be characterized as a political issue, the debate soon got entangled in many theological issues as Henry's interests clashed with those of the papacy. The chief problems came from two main questions: Who holds the supreme religious authority? Before the English Reformation began, bishops held considerable authority and power and were more or less independent of the King (on religious matters). They themselves were governed under Roman Cannon Law (Papal law, not the law left by the Roman Empire, although Papal law itself came from several Byzantine decrees). Even their appointment was done by the Pope and not by the King. As such, Bishops could and did subdue the King's authority on religious and spiritual matters in their jurisdictions. To counter this, especially to remove challenges to his marriage question, Henry had his ministers pass The Ecclesiastical Appeals Act (1532) that forbade appeals to the Pope on religious matters and made the King chief authority on such appeals. To limit their authority further, an act was passed in 1535 to destroy the "corrupt" monasteries (see below). Who should receive the taxes from religious institutions? Abbeys and Monasteries in medieval England were fairly rich. These institutions paid a large portion of their taxes to Rome. And that was in turn because they were governed by Rome and not by England. Although Henry started off with a very prosperous economy, his extravagant spending on navy, infantry, and construction left the exchequer in debt. Monasteries and Abbeys were a lucrative source of revenue for this poor King and his administration. The Act in Conditional Restraint of Annates limited the amount of taxes such institutions could pay to the Pope. Two years later, they were completely forbidden. This wikipedia link claims (with sources): 

$URL$ shows that the city was called Delhi (or Dilli) at least since the 12/13th century. Therefore, when Akbar assumed throne in 1556, the city would have been called Delhi. There are however more concrete sources than this simple extrapolation. Humayun Nama refers to the city as Delhi. You can read it here. 

Yesterday's [23rd May 2013's] IHT had this interesting historical news clip in its 100, 75, 50 years ago section. It refers to a British colony in Berlin in 1913 of which Mr. J. W. Louth was apparently the dean. 

--China: A History, John Keay, pg. 91 (third paragraph), 2008-2009 print edition. Now, it seems that he has defined the "feet" in the literal sense of the word. But counting in double strides, it would then become "three strides" not "six feet". And he hasn't clarified what he means by "inches". Around that time, according to wikipedia, the Chinese measurements were 尺, 步, and 里 --none of whose six counts come close to acceptable widths of tally-sticks or carriages. The Question Because the author specifies no sources for this speculation I reach out to Chinese history experts on this SE to get their opinion on the correctness of his claim and perhaps even clarifications on what he may have meant by "inches" and "feet". 

It is hard to prove a negative but we do not have any sources that mention any public resistance or open rebellion against Queen Hatshepsut's rule. Marc Van de Mieroop in his Egypt textbook A History of Ancient Egypt writes that the New Kingdom period is probably the one of best documented period of Ancient Egypt. We have surviving accounts from not only the countless royal inscriptions, monuments, and public documents but also from a surprising number of auto-biographies and journals of citizens, the richly detailed official accounts of military actions, legal documents and letters written by private individuals (e.g., Deir el - Medina), and surviving diplomatic correspondence. In all this evidence that Egyptologists have available we do not have any mention of a mass public resistance against Hatshepsut's rule. If the absence of such an incident from official records makes sense the lack of even a hint from private accounts of individuals will not. That so even when she usurped Thutmose III's rule and established herself as the "King". Wikipedia: 

The Revolution N.B.:- I summarise Fisk’s observations he made while in Iran and a well cited Wikipedia article now. With enough powerful groups in opposition by 1970 the Shah could only hope for people’s support —the very [supposed] benefactors of his reforms. Let us now look at the Iranian demographics —an overwhelming Islamic majority and a predominately young educated but unemployed crowd^10. As with all revolutions, however we like to believe that it was all planned, much of it actually is shaped along the course. The Iranian revolution started with protests against the one-party system, unemployment, and corruption in the government 10 years before the actual revolution (the specific protests against the one party system obviously began after 1975 when the party was founded). By that time, Khomeini had had opposed the Shah for a long time and had been, as a result, exiled. He had hidden himself in France. He was a charismatic figure in Iran^1 and the clergy portrayed him as following the footsteps of Hussaeyn Ibn Ali, a Shia Imam, who had opposed a tyrant. Seeing his growing popularity, many sections of clergy back at home attempted to galavinze the crowds by presenting Islamic causes —some of these were not in league with Khomeini. Islamic plans for modernization (most notably by Ali Shariati and Abulhassan Bani-sadar) found acceptance in the general populace. There were Marxist sections too but they didn’t strike the resonance that the Islamic movement did as the Shah’s policies weren’t very different from what the Marxists proposed (one party system, political restrictions). But the Shah’s policies were very different from what the proponents of various Islamic movements proposed. The Shah’s “anti Islamic” reform moves were heavily advertised in pamphlets and speeches^1. His pro CIA stance, his previous collaboration in Operation Ajax, his pro Israel stance, and a general move towards Westernization were demonized.^1. The Islamic movement promised to protect Iran from foreigners (who were blamed for all the problems) and bring the Iranian law in line with the Sharia. Given the target approach, the crowd’s support followed. That is why the revolution became Islamic in nature. 

Yes. It was Decius. But I cannot say if it was because Christians were being too aggressive. It could have been an attempt to gain public acceptance. 

India's military is not independent of the democratic structure. The President of the Republic of India is the supreme commander of the armed forces and the three arms --land, air, and naval are independent of each other. While the former is true for many countries including Pakistan, the latter is not usually the case. Each service branch of the Indian armed forces has an independent Chief of Staff who only reports to the President of India. Although India has a chairman of the chief of staff committee, that post has no formal executive power of the committee. The President of India too has no formal executive power (except during times of emergency) and most of the power is exercised by the Ministry of Defence that is answerable to the Parliament and the People of India. In addition, India has a fourth branch of armed forces that reports directly to the Ministry of Home Affairs (not the ministry of Defence). This branch is commonly referred to as the paramilitary force. According to the Wikipedia article I cited above, it has some 65,000 active personnel. 

Do we know where the first Visa documents were issued? The history of passports is old with Wikipedia dating them back to 450 BC. But when did Visas come into the picture? The etymology suggests a Latin connection but that does not necessarily prove it. The Wikipedia page for Visa only alludes to their increased popularity and does not shed much light on where the concept evolved. 

That is actually the whole article and there is not much information on why it is called Ganges. And although I cannot prove a negative, Frank Welsh doesn't write about it in A History of Hong Kong either. My theory is that the river was named Ganges by early British/Indian settlers who either relocated from the Bengal province or compared it to the river in the Bengal province (perhaps to equalise themselves with that then more profitable province/trade route) that goes by the same name (River Ganga). Edit: I should probably mention this. I have been to see this river and it is a natural waterway. In the colonial times it was used as a trade route with posts set up on its banks. No one (who showed me around) seems to know why it is called Ganges. Also, River Ganges was used as the longest trade route in India since late antiquity. Of course, I mention this fact to support my theory but I want to confirm my theory with the experts on this site (who may have alternate theories/more [interesting] information) --hence the question. 

Was there a (more or less) uniform law? A uniform law would mean that different kingdoms and janpads would follow roughly similar laws. Non uniformity would mean widely different laws in different realms. Was this law (or these laws) documented? Were there lawyers and trained magistrates? 

Because this question has been edited many times I have to clarify that I am answering the version that asks: What caused the Iranian 1979 revolution to become Islamic? Short Answer (more suited for causal conversations in bars): It was easier to portray the Shah as anti Islamic ruler in league with the Western powers bent on destroying Islam in an Islamic majority country. Long Answer: This explains why it was easier to do so. 

Background N.B.:- I mainly quote from two type of sources --a book and online sources. Citations numbered 1 refer to the book "The Great War for Civilization" by Robert Fisk. The specific chapter I draw my conclusions from is Chapter 4, The Carpet Weavers. All other sources will be clearly mentioned. To understand the Islamic Revolution of 1979 we should put the Shah's rule into perspective. Back in 1953 Iran was under the rule of the Pahlavi dynasty and Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi was the king. In that year, Iran's only^1 democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, aided by a unanimous parliamentary vote, successfully nationalised the Iranian Petroleum Industry^4. As a result the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, later British Petroleum) lost all of its oil refineries in that country. The AIOC was at that time the chief source of revenue to Her Majesty's Government in the UK. Mossadeq also tended to lean towards the USSR^1. The former irked the British administration and the latter US administration. Together, these two countries, under the administration of Churchill and Eisenhower respectively, designed the Operation Ajax and successfully deposed Mossadeq in a coup d'état^4,^1. The two administrations jointly selected Fazlollah Zahedi^4,^1 to become the next Prime Minister of Iran. Following the deposition of Mossadeq, the Shah worked closely with the CIA^8 and introduced pro British/American policies in Iran. The Shah was also keen on pushing through what was called the White Revolution. The White Revolution was initiated by a popular referendum. It started with intense land reforms that abolished feudalism in Iran. Many government owned enterprises were privatised. Women got the right to vote. Free and compulsory (western) education was introduced. Workers got the right to own shares in their factories. There were several campaigns against “Unreasonable profiteering” and many wealthy businessmen were heavily fined or imprisoned. The Shah also established anti corruption bureaus. While many of these moves were supposed to close Iran’s wealth gap, give more civil rights to its citizens, and clean up the government they came under intense criticism from the [mainly Islamic] clergy who opposed the women’s rights movements, western education, induction of non Muslim members to the Parliaments, and minority voting. The reforms also attracted criticism from the landlords and business owners who opposed the land reforms, industrial reforms, price control measures, and workers’ rights movements. And last, as the Shah cemented his authority over the administration —limited it to a single political party (the Rastakhiz) and his core loyal group —new groups of opponents who desired political power were created. It is also important to bear in mind that the Shah and his dynasty associated themselves with the millennia old Persian monarchy and not the Islamic monarchy. For example, the Shah changed the calendar to start year 1 not with Prophet Mohammad’s pilgrimage to Medina but with the birth of Cyrus the Great. In 1971, as another example, he spent more than US $100 million^1 to celebrate the 2500 years of Iranian monarchy. The Shah also used to frequently call the White Revolution a process for “Westernization”. While the term White officially referred to the revolution being bloodless and not racial characteristics of the Western people and Westernization officially meant “development and liberalization”, these terms nonetheless associated him with the CIA and USA even more closely.
