We have another baby on the way and I was thinking about asking this previously, but wasn't sure how common it was as our first child predates this site by about 4 years. Now we have another on the way it has come up again and people keep telling us we shouldn't be announcing our pregnancy until the second trimester. Their suggestion is that it is more likely that there will be complications in the first semester and this will ultimately lead to our embarrassment. This is usually mentioned quite abruptly as if this a regular occurrence and we will suffer the consequence of going around telling everyone. Based on fact, in the developed world do more deaths happen during the first trimester or during the rest of the pregnancy including labor? This would be for a healthy female aged 18 - 35. I also don't know if this has any effect on the figures, but it should be assumed that during the first trimester a pregnancy is not identified until after 5 - 6 weeks has already passed. As nobody would go around announcing something that never happened if there was some sort of complication during that period. 

Is it true that most birds learn to fly by being pushed out of the nest? I've seen this most often in cartoons and quoted all over the net. Here is an example quote: 

Quite a common story that gets brought up around airports or business meetings when someone wants to provide a famous example of small change for massive savings is the olive story. Apparently there was an airline that managed to save tens of thousands of dollars per year by removing a single olive from the salads in their meals, because it was hardly noticed by customers it was a massive win, tens of thousands of dollars without anyone noticing. How true is this story? Did this actually get implemented or was it something that someone brought up at a meeting and it was never actioned although it became famous? 

I can't find any evidence of a study done on peanuts, however here are some other interesting articles that appear to have research to back them up: 

(Snopes article does not address peanuts, only mints, and peanuts are still available in many Australian bars and clubs I have been to) 

There also appears to be a related patent $URL$ Note: I know nothing about patents, this may not be a true patent, just something related I found. Both of these studies are limited and are not double blind studies. The studies do indicate that patients personally indicated there was significant relief associated with these soap patches. The wording in the studies is also a bit iffy, so I would take it more along the lines of strong anecdotal evidence than a conclusive study. It's a very interesting precursor for prompting a serious double blind study which appears to have not been done so far. The cause of the relief in both studies is put down to the scent having a relaxing effect. This leads to another skeptical question: how effective is aromatherapy outside of the placebo effect? 

I would assume you won't be telling friends and family until you have been to a GP and confirmed your pregnancy and will likely be around 6/7 weeks after being assured that you have missed your most recent period. It may be wise to hold off a couple of weeks, but by week 8 there is already quite a high chance that things will progress normally. This is still 4 weeks from the second trimester. I personally think at 6 weeks and 9.4% you can still be justified in announcing to your friends and family early even if things don't work out. Assuming you are healthy and have not had previous complications or miscarriages. 

The thread below is the only mention of the people first responsible for the traverse. This is credited as Tita Piaz and Hans DÃ¼lfer (although due to the lack of quantity of information there may have been others involved). Of note is this translation of the wikipedia article on Tita Piaz: 

The USDA also previously had a database which showed some typical analysis for foods to identify added sugars. On a page marked last updated 2012 it now says this regarding the previous mentioned database: 

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention page on US Cancer Statistics: An interactive atlas The rate of skin cancer deaths for CA is 1.5 and the US national rate is 1.7: 

So I think you are just misunderstanding the quote. What Nile is saying is that people are getting it wrong when they think that Parkes was aiming to eradicate religious studies from schools by separating secular education from religious studies. Rev. Nile is not claiming that Parkes wanted to make it Christian but non, denominational. 

Has there been any reliable independent studies into the efficacy of chiropractic treatment and claims that it can either cure or provide significant relief from mechanical disorders? Is there any reported data to suggest a greater number of people receive injury as a result of treatment by a chiropractor when compared to other medical professions? Is chiropractic treatment high risk? According to a statement in this wikipedia article: 

So around 1986 the value should be somewhere between $100 million and $1 billion which makes it still only a fraction of the $4.47 billion claimed above in 1986. FACT: Porn was available on Betamax FACT: There was a lot more porn produced on VHS than Betamax It also appears that the porn is only a fraction of the market of video sales and rentals and therefore couldn't have been the key influencer. 

If you believe the internet, there is no healthy way for you to sleep: front, back, side, fetal; they are all going to cause you problems like acid reflux, spinal problems, skin problems, problems with your breasts. Here is a sample of the claims and I have found a couple of sources for sleeping on your back being a problem unless you add a rolled up towel or pillows under your legs. Is there a sleep position which will give you less (or none at all) medical problems when compared to others? Unless there are medical concerns is it possible to sleep without assistance (extra pillows, towels, whatever) without risking or causing issues with your health? 

This document around labeling requirements for sugar is also worth reading as it also goes into great detail around the lack of solid requirements to label sugars on packaging in the US. Based on this information I would say if you are not going with whole foods then it is going to be difficult to tell. Your best option is to stick with fresh produce, nuts and meats. Anything packaged and you are heading into an area which is uncertain. 

What is also evident from the bits and pieces around there is no conclusive evidence to suggest a massive increase or decrease in productivity, however music does provide a level of personal comfort and enjoyment. So the benefit isn't weighable by the employer, but there is a perceived level of satisfaction by the employee. 

I have not been able to track down information specifically on adults learning a second language and the effect of passive listening. Note that passive listening is not putting a language tape in and repeating the words, its sitting in a room full of native speakers and just listening to what they are saying or having a foreign language television on in the background while you go about some other task. I could sit in a room full of nuclear physicists and listen to them talk all day, but even though I know rudimentary mathematics what I can learn from them is going to be very little if nothing. I think research would suggest as per the child study that having a live adult engaging with you versus passive listening provides significantly greater benefit. 

Although the above is not from a scientific article I think it is clear and logical that zinc poisoning is possible if you were to ingest a product that contains zinc. There is no indication of what levels of zinc poisoning or zinc ingestion needs to occur before there is damage to the kidneys, but zinc poisoning will damage your organs. There is nothing to indicate that topical use will lead to kidney failure. There is evidence to suggest that someone silly enough could correlate kidney failure with calamine lotion purely because it contains zinc oxide. 

This has its source as eMarketer who according to themselves is based on "Data from over 4,000 Worldwide Sources". Which in itself is not a reasonable source for this site. It seems this question came up around 2007 and there was some interest in it, but as most of it was tripe and unprovable people stopped paying attention. One reliable source would be a national census. I am a non-American, so can't say for the USA and unfortunately for Australia the last available data is from 2000 which is now over 10 years old. A further search revealed little information from American census data that was recent. Accoding to this report Office for National Statistics - Internet Access Quarterly Update, May 2011 from the UK Office for National statistics is says: 

First, it needs to be understood as per @Hendy's comment that disposable face masks can trap or allow airborne particles to pass through. There are several studies to back this up and indicates that up to 100% of the particles could pass through: 

Both of these seem contradictory to me, although this could be just my lack of understanding. I have not personally reviewed any figures, but the claims made in public seem to be clear. So is one group incorrect or is it just the media taking things out of context? 

I have just found an article from 2011 where this suggestion is reinforced by the same Mark Newton, who is now a Professor Mark Newton. So hopefully that will suffice. There was also a quilt that was sold in Australia a few years back (I can't source it now). Where the women's side was actually made from warmer material than the men's half of the quilt. 

Firstly, we know that the mechanism exists for this to be achieved: dogs can already do this and can distinguish which and where human scents have been left. In the case with Feynman he is claiming a similar mechanism, getting people to touch books that haven't been touched in a while so there is no residual scent and being able to find which book has been touched by comparing a person's scent to a scent left on a particular book. He has a slightly easier job to a dog that is picking up the scent of a stranger running through the bush. I also have other anecdotes on the net where people have claimed Richard continued to do this as a party trick to non-believers, so it appears it was not a one-off which he refused to do again. 

From the results (refer to the paper) 62.86% of the test group met the individual success criteria of 3 inches. It's a long enough paper, so I've deliberately tried to display the most relevant information to the question. Also of note is this passage here, and I'm not a doctor, but refer to the context yourself if you think I'm taking this out of context: 

I saw a mini-documentary today from a German show in English called In Focus, it was an expose on asbestos contained in Chinese produced thermoses. The documentary and as an example this website claim that asbestos is quite prevalent in Chinese produced thermoses and can easily get through undetected and onto the market. 

As also indicated in the paper, cats can become attached to the person that feeds them regularly and will happily follow the owner around if there is the promise of food. Here is a link to the video on youtube. 

I can't find a reference on the Guiness World Records web site, but this news article from 2010 says: 

It cracks me up every time I look at it, but the story seems like a fake. The thing that I think gives it away are the images of the two paintings side-by-side. So is there any truth in this story? There appears to be no evidence of the original painting aside from the image being circulated. 

Teeth whitening toothpaste is one of the latest marketing tools or alleged added functions of many brands. I have also read several blogs or journalists who have had teeth whitening laser treatment and claimed it wasn't "7 shades brighter" or whatever was claimed, essentially claiming they were fooled out of money. Is there reliable research to back up claims by toothpaste companies or by laser whitening services? Usually the measuring tool is a card with different shades of white and you measure yourself against one and then after a certain period of time you claim you are now x# of shades lighter. 

Do celebrities have a higher divorce rate than the general population. This is normally focused around Hollywood type celebrities, so for comparison sake: Is the divorce rate amongst U.S celebrities in the past decade higher than in the general U.S population? Example: 

Do cats and / or dogs have saliva that has antibacterial or antiseptic properties? Are these any more effective at preventing infection than the saliva of humans or any other animal (is cat or dog saliva more special than any other animals saliva)? The claim is that dog/cat saliva is an effective antibacterial / antiseptic agent: 

It lists references at the bottom of the article. So it looks like there are studies that support the claim which answers your question. However, the numbers are significantly low to make a solid claim. 

There is only one documented case of a dog who had to be euthanised after jumping from the bridge due to injuries sustained. There is no other documented evidence to suggest many or even a few dogs have leapt to their deaths from the bridge. So there is nothing to investigate. No dog deaths = no phenomenon. It's an interesting story, but not founded on fact. Brian Dunning from the Skeptoid Podcast actually made the effort to ask around, including the owners of Overtoun House and a local vet who has only treated four dogs after leaping from the bridge. 

So an actual event did happen, with a real person. Is there a known scientific explanation for this alleged miracle? The sister herself claims that she was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2001. There is currently no known cure for Parkinson's disease source 1, source 2. So there are only a few possibilities: 

It appears Malenium is just a trademarked name based on the information provided here by the Blublocker corporation. A search for "Malenium Polycarbonate" on Google only provides around 29 results, some are garbage the rest just relate to the Blublocker corporation so there aren't other brands of sunglasses that are made from "Malenium Polycarbonate". Polycarbonate is just a synthetic resin. According to this website: 

I've heard it mentioned regularly that India and China are going through diabetes epidemics. The reason I am given is because of the raised standard of living means people are now eating large quantities of white rice and because of its apparent sugar content it is causing an increase in the number of people with diabetes. Is there any thorough research to indicate that the regular consumption of white rice causes a high risk of diabetes? 

Although this doesn't answer your question directly, I think it does a good job of answering indirectly. Research shows a strong correlation between vocabulary and general intelligence. So does using big words make you appear smart, maybe, but having a high level of vocabulary (and being able to use it) would indicate that you actually are smarter. The key to the sentence above is actually being able to use the words correctly. Just going out and learning a bunch of words is not going to immediately make you smarter, but having a strong grasp of the language and a wide vocabulary indicates you are smarter. Your question has a large subjective part to it, because if I am really clever and use lots of clever words I may be smarter than someone with a low I.Q, but they may just think I'm a dick. This means that your question answered in that way can't be answered objectively. Now on to some examples: 

Most references I can find link it to AA, but there is nothing backing this up on either their website and its not referenced in the AA wikipedia article. Is there any definitive proof that can confirm this (like a newspaper from 1987 with the story or a company flyer etc. that has this information)? 

My question is, with a reasonable knowledge of statistics and enough money (say $10 million) is it possible to win the KENO jackpot? The version of KENO I am referring to is the on on this site: $URL$ and I cannot confirm how many numbers he matched to get the jackpot (so was did it match smaller numbers with a larger investment or visa-versa). As commented below, What I'm trying to get across is that this wasn't just some guy off the street, he is a highly seasoned gambler and maybe one of the best in the world. He played for a long period of time with large amounts of cash wagered. He seemed to expect that he was going to win. If you read his wiki article you will see he always tries to stack the odds in his favor. So why Keno, if it's just any old game? This is not just a question of maths or just saying if gambling you will always lose. He obviously didn't think so.
