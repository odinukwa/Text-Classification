What I miss in the other answers is water quality. Even is there is sufficient water available it is often of insufficient quality for the purpose you want it for: 

Brian Dunning already went into this extensively in episode 4170 of Skeptoid: It's Raining Frogs and Fish 

But as you get from the comments below your post, how useful that data is remains doubtful. As an example: The first hit for the austria monthly rainfall search says: 

The article is behind a paywall, so I cannot look at the actual study - the abstract does not mention anything about coral growth. As far as I know, sea level rise is going to be much faster than coral can grow, plus we have the complication factor of reduced grow (or actual coral death) because of rising sea water acidity and temperature. But it's still an intriguing question: Could there be a hint of truth in this, that coral growth could keep up with sea level rise? Maybe with a little help from us? Has this been investigated? * You may have trouble following this link directly. In that case go to the start page, Andrew Bolt's blog, and look up the article there. ** Australian dollars, I assume. That would be US$ 227 million 

No. There is a difference in daylight according to latitude, but it is not because of proximity to the sun, and nor is there a significant difference in the total number of daylight hours in a year. What is different is that at the equator, the length of the day is nearly equal all year round. The higher your latitude (the further from the equator and the nearer to the poles) the more difference there is in the length of the day between summer and winter - with the extreme at the poles of six months of light or darkness. 

Just to add some more weight to one point of casey's excellent answer: There is no single definition of what "high resolution" means. Different fields, and hence different types of modelling, will have different perceptions of this. Also, even within one field, the resolution that a model must have to be called "high" tends to increase over time as available computing power increases. For example, this paper from 1993 describes a regional tidal model as "high-resolution" with a grid size of approximately 1km. Eighteen years later, this paper uses "high resolution" to describe a 50m grid (it's a nested grid, and this resolution is only in the area of interest, but the point is that the meaning of the term has changed within the same type of modelling).

Search tourist websites for the countries you are interested in. They very often have average data on temperature and rainfall by month. Just Google countryname monthly rainfall. You may get general descriptions instead of hard (tabular) data, but since you only have to collect the data once, that's doable. 

There is another factor not yet mentioned contributing to the effect you notice: global warming is related to the total cumulative amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, not to what we are emitting in this instance. The atmospheric lifetime of CO2 is estimated to be of the order of 30–95 years, i.e. if we stop emitting now the warming will continue into the future before reaching a peak and declining. If you look at the Mauna Loa graph in Gordon's answer: the warming in year X is not related to the Y-value for X, but to the total area under the graph to year X. Quoting from e.g. the PDF Cumulative Carbon and Just Allocation of the Global Carbon Commons: 

and according to BOC contains 34 kg of gas, at a pressure of up to 50 bar. So that's 29.4 cylinders per tonne or, to contain 5 million tonnes of CO2, 147 million of these cylinders. 

There are two stages to what you want here. 1. Converting point data to gridded data First off, since you want to plot regular cells rather than the actual data that you have, you need to covert your point data to cells in some way. The best way to do this may depend on the data itself, but one way would be to interpolate, perhaps using something along the lines of, 

It would certainly be possible to construct a series of balloons that reached neutral buoyancy at different altitudes, so in that sense the answer is "yes". I'm not sure whether there's necessarily any correlation between balloon size and altitude, except in that a given balloon will expand as it rises. 

You're right. Water has a much higher specific heat capacity than air, so will change temperature much more slowly. This means that, 

As you have noted, this technology is new, and so far only small numbers of experimental tidal energy converters (TECs) have been deployed. For this reason, little has been possible in the way of measurement, and so as you note, all estimates are based on models or other means of prediction. To answer the second question first - how much the currents are affected depends how much of the energy you remove. Since the whole point of TECs is to remove energy from the flow, there must be some effect on currents. Garrett & Cummins (2005) built a simple analytic model of a channel between two large basins (which reflects many tidal energy scenarios) and showed that if all other considerations (e.g. navigation, engineering practicality) are ignored then the maximum power that may be extracted from the channel is obtained when its flow rate is reduced by approximately two thirds. However, this scenario is unlikely to ever be obtained, and the real limit on energy extraction at a given site (if not an economic limit) will probably be determined by what level of environmental effects are deemed to be acceptable. The relationship between power extracted and effect on the flow is not a simple one, and in most cases a significant proportion of the available power could be obtained with a relatively small change to the local currents. A number of modelling studies have been made of more realistic scenarios for early deployment (e.g. Admadien et al 2012). These typically predict local changes to current speeds of up to 30%, which fade after a few km. Typically there is a decrease in the flow speed in line with the TECs, and an increase to either side of the farm/array, as some of the flow diverts around the added impedence. Effects on residual velocity (i.e. that which is left in the long term when the tidal cycles are averaged out over a period of time), which is relevant to sediment transport processes, are predicted up to at least 15km away. Some baroclinic modelling (Yang & Wang 2013) has suggested increased mixing, and thus decreased stratification, as a result of the turbulence introduced by TECs. It is also conceivable that in other scenarios, stratification might be increased as a result of reduced flow speeds. Physical effects, then, are likely to include direct effects on current speed, sediment, and stratification. The obvious possible biological effect is from collisions. This is not my field, but as I understand it no effect is likely on small fish populations from collisions, although individuals may be affected. Collision risk for large animals (e.g. sharks and marine mammals) and for diving birds is a topic of active research, and is likely (especially for mammals) to depend on their behaviour around the devices. No large animal collisions have been reported on any of the prototypes undergoing testing so far. A good review of possible effects on benthic organisms is provided by Shields et al (2011). These may include,

This is probably not the specific video you are looking for, but here is one: The video Latent heat of fusion shows the effect that you mean in a real world situation where the water is not mixed well. The video Determination of Melting Point of Ice shows it under more controlled conditions. The video Heat in changes of state explains it with a graph. The video Energy required to melt ice and warm the water gives you an actual calculation example and shows the energy involved in melting ice vs. heating water. 

The list of recommendations towards the end of that article specifically mentions as contributing factors: sulphur content, moisture, age of the mined coal and the obvious availability of oxygen and ambient temperature. Don't forget to read the A Lesson Learned from the Titanic at the end, describing how in April 1912, their bunker coal was on fire 'from the day we put out of Southhampton until we hit the iceberg'. I think it is crucial to note that the tiniest amount of oxidation will lead to a rise in temperature, accelerating the process exponentially. 

It would be easy to test this by putting a black enclosure with a UV-admitting filter over the rocks and an observer's head... :-) (if anybody with actual specific knowledge would like to confirm or deny this, I'd be very grateful!) 

You have the right idea, but you have your units and orders of magnitude confused. You have started with knowing that Canada has 34 million people, and emits 0.55Gt - i.e. $0.55 \times 10^9$ tonnes - per year. Now rather than just using those figures, think about the units that you have, and the units that you've been asked to give the answer in. How many kilograms are in a gigatonne? Once you have a figure for kilograms per year, how will you convert this to kilograms per day? NB I haven't checked your actual figures - only your arithmetic! 

Starting from scratch and building a "toy model" is unlikely to be successful here, because while you could certainly model Newtonian tides, much of what happens on the continental shelves is tied very closely into the shapes of coastlines and bathymetry, the interaction between the inertia of the tidal wave and friction on the seabed, and so forth - a lot of non-linear effects, some of which are not fully understood. My suggestion would be to start with an existing, validated, global ocean model and tweak its input parameters. For example, to simulate a change in the gravitational pull of the moon you could change the amplitudes of the lunar tidal constituents that drive the model (and perhaps also their periods, if you wanted to work out the appropriate orbital mechanics!). Be aware that running models of this sort tends to be computationally expensive, obviously depending on the resolution - but it should be within the realms of what is feasible on a home computer, if you don't mind things taking a week or two to run (I assume, since this is a hobby project, that you don't have access to HPC resources for it). I'm not sure whether anybody makes a simple but validated model openly available - if anybody knows of one, perhaps they could comment. If not, you might have to build your own using an open source code, which would be substantially more work. 

Whether this was actually done with the 2010 one I could not find (yet). Even the Wikipedia entry on the 2010 sinkhole (which you are also refering to) says This section needs to be updated. It seems to be closed now, look at this video fragment compared with the bottom picture here. Note that 7000-8000 m3 sounds like a lot, but that is only 400-500 truck loads. 

BTW (I know, that is not answering the question, but it was too nice to not add):Instead of filling them up you can also make a garden in them:

Paul Kench's page at the University of Auckland lists several of his publications, and maybe the blog post refers to this one: Destruction or persistence of coral atoll islands in the face of 20th and 21st century sea-level rise? From the abstract: 

In those locations however, there is a stronger effect: The ice masses themselves exert a large gravitational pull on the surrounding water, resulting in a lowering of the sea level around those masses (Greenland, Antarctica) when the ice melts. This may seem counter-intuitive, and is best explained by looking at what happens when the ice masses grow: The gravitation of the growing mass pulls water towards it. The resulting sea level rise on the edges of the ice mass is therefore larger than the eustatic (global, uniform, across the world) sea level decrease that occurs because of the water moving into the ice. The effect is that near the ice mass, sea level actually rises, and far away it falls faster than 'expected'. When the ice melts the reverse happens: sea level close to the ice mass will drop, sea level far away will rise more than 'expected'. To give this some actual numbers: The eustatic sea level rise corresponding to the melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice caps is both approx. 6 meters. Here in Europe (I live in the Netherlands) however, the Greenland melt would 'only' result in approx. 3 meters rise, because that is relatively close, but the West Antarctic melt would result in something like 8-9 meters extra water. This picture shows the relative effect calculated for water running of West Antarctica. You should read the numbers as a multiplication factor to apply to amount of sea level rise in the case of a uniform distribution. 

Caveat: I'm answering this in a popular context. There may be more technical definitions, which I'd be interested in hearing about. It seems to be generally accepted that continents are not, themselves, islands. This is a common confusion in pub quiz questions, where people argue over whether the largest island in the world is Greenland, Australia, or (if somebody especially pedantic is around) the combined landmass of Europe, Asia and Africa. So the question comes down to "what is a continent"? It's more of a political / historical / geographical unit than a topological one. If continents were demarcated by coastlines, then Europe, Africa and Asia would all be one. Additionally, many small mid-ocean islands, which are not on continental shelves, would end up being continents. It's tempting to think of continents as relating to tectonic plates, but even if we disregard mid-continent faults and "complicated" areas, Europe and Asia are hard to separate.... and the 6 continents as currently thought of were pretty much set before plate tectonics was advanced as a theory. Wikipedia has an interesting article on historic boundaries between continents; the one between Europe and Asia is especially ambiguous. I'm not aware of any definition of "subcontinent", and have never heard this term used for anything other than the area around India, so I suspect this is also a political and historical term. So to answer the question: No, there is not a size-based distinction between islands and continents, although the smallest continent is indeed bigger than the largest island. The definition of an island would seem to be "a landmass surrounded by water that is not thought of as a continent". As for "islet", again, I'm not aware of any formal definition. However, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea does distinguish between islands and "rocks", where the latter are islets that are too small to be habitable. This is an important definition, because unlike islands, rocks are not considered when defining a nation's exclusive economic zone (the area in which they may control who fishes, drills for oil, and so forth).

There are many factors involved, so this is worth yet another answer. At the end of his/her answer aretxabaleta states: 

There are no circles, it is an image artifact. Here is another picture from Dingo Gap that shows nothing at the exact same position. Your mind is a well-trained pattern-matching machine that makes up patterns even when they are not actually there. In other words don't jump to conclusions. You are claiming that there are actual structures, which is one step too 'far'. (Credit: Emily Lakdawallah blog post) 

For frogs it seem to be coincidences of bad weather and frog migration.Well, not really coincidence: they probably migrate more (often) when it's wet. And for fish: 

On 11 sep 2016, the Australian Herald Sun placed an opinion piece by Andrew Bolt titled Drowning in cash: Pacific islands love this scare* about the $300 million** financial aid pledged by the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, at a Pacific leaders’ forum in Micronesia last week (I guess that's this meeting), to help the Pacific “manage climate change and improve disaster resilience". Bolt's critique is that these islands do not actually face much danger: 

As noted in comments, the earth rotates on its axis in about 23hrs 56 minutes. This is known as the sidereal day, that is, the day with respect to background stars. (that's not quite true, but it's good enough unless you're dealing with periods of thousands of years with high accuracy - see the linked wiki article if you care about the detail). At the same time, the Earth is also orbiting around the Sun in the same direction, and the combination of the Earth's spin and its orbit around the Sun gives us the 24-hour solar day that we are familiar with, and that you have already modelled in your game. Now consider how the Moon rises and sets, when seen from a position on Earth. The primary cause of this is, again, the Earth's rotation with it's just-less-than-24-hours period. In addition, this time, one must consider the motion of the Moon around the Earth, which is again in the same direction as the Earth's spin. This results in a period of about 24 hr 50 mins for the apparent motion of the Moon across the sky (Source). For your game that may be sufficient info, although if you want to be accurate it is complicated. Remember to also take account of the phases of the moon - because the whole earth-moon system is also in orbit around the sun, and because the moon is only visible via reflected light, the mere fact that the moon is above the horizon when seen from a given point on earth does not mean that it is visible.
