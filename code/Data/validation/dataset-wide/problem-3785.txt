I think this is more-or-less in Ren√©'s (deleted) post, but here it is. First suppose $B\rightarrow C$ is separable. A $\mathbb{F}_q$-point of $B$ or $B'$ must live above a $\mathbb{F}_q$-point $x$ of $C$. If $x$ is a branch point, then both $B$ and $B'$ has a $\mathbb{F}_q$-point above it. Otherwise, the two points of $B$ and $B'$ above $x$ must be defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. Suppose a point of $B$ above is defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$, then so is the other one because there is nowhere its Galois conjugate can go. Now for me quadratic twist means to twist the Galois action of $\text{Gal}(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}/\mathbb{F}_q)$ by the only $C$-automorphism of $B$. So the non-trivial element in $\text{Gal}(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}/\mathbb{F}_q)$ has to send a point on $B'$ above $x$ to the other, i.e. neither of them are defined over $\mathbb{F}_q)$. Similarly when the points in $B$ above $x$ are not defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$, the two in $B'$ must be defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$. So in any case we always have exactly two $\mathbb{F}_q$-points in $B$ and $B'$ above a $\mathbb{F}_q$-point of $C$. If $p=2$ and $B\rightarrow C$ is inseparable, I guess in this case one has to define $B'=B$. $B$ will be the Frobenius twist of $C$ and thus have the same number of $\mathbb{F}_q$-points as $C$. 

Let $F$ be, say, a non-archimedean local field. Let $G$ be a connected reductive (can be assumed simply connected) quasi-split group $G$ over $F$. Let $X\in\operatorname{Lie}G$ be semisimple and $G_X:=C_G(X)$. How can we give an explicit example in which $G_X$ is not quasi-split? Thanks and pardon for the probably pretty simple question. I don't really know if such $G_X$ exist, but will be surprised if they don't, as I learned that when Langlands and Shelstad did descent for transfer factors they had to deal with the possibility of non-quasi-split centralizer (though for the group). 

(Edited: I don't know if my first assertion is correct. My apology.) I hope I am not saying something stupid: suppose otherwise. Then the character is supported near some $g\in G(F)$ regular semisimple with $T=Z_G(g)$, with $\alpha:T\rightarrow\mathbb{G}_m$ such that $\alpha(g)\not\in\mathcal{O}_F^{\times}$. We have then a vector $v$ such that $g.v=cv$ for some $c\not=0$. Now $\alpha$ decides a parabolic $P=MN$. As a smooth vector $v$ is invariant under some open subgroup of $N(F)$. But then conjugation by $g$ will translate this open subgroup to the whole $N(F)$. The admissible representation we began with is thus not supercuspidal. 

[Editted: The assertion is wrong; see Jay's answer] My apology if this question is too simple. I am reading Deligne-Lusztig "Reductive groups over finite fields" and at the beginning of Chap. 4, there is a statement saying something about Green functions which seems to claim the following: Let $G$ be a adjoint semisimple group over a finite field $k$ and let $u\in G(k)$ be any unipotent element. Then $u$ is conjugate to $u^n$ in $G(k)$ for any $n$ prime to $p=\text{char}(k)$. I know how to prove this when $p$ is good for $G$. It will be great to know how to do it in general. Thanks! 

I am wondering if there is a theorem of Shalika germ (as below) for local function field, for both the group version or the Lie algebra version, probably under assumption on the characteristic to be very good. Thank you! Theorem (Shalika) Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over $F$. $u_1,...,u_n\in G(F)$ (resp. $\in\mathfrak{g}(F)$) be a list of the finite set of unipotent (resp. nilpotent) $G(F)$-conjugacy orbits. There exists locally constant functions $\Gamma_1,...,\Gamma_n$ on $G(F)^{rs}$ (resp. $\mathfrak{g}(F)^{rs}$), the regular semisimple locus, such that for any smooth compactly supported function $f\in C_c^{\infty}(G(F))$ (resp. $C_c^{\infty}(\mathfrak{g}(F))$, one has $\mu_{\gamma}(f)=\sum\Gamma_i(\gamma)\mu_{u_i}(f)$ for $\gamma$ close enough to $1\in G(F)$ (resp. $0\in\mathfrak{g}(F)$), where $\mu_{\gamma}$ denotes the orbital integral. 

Pardon if this is well known. Suppose I have a (say complex) connected reductive group $G^{\vee}$ with the $\tilde{\Delta}=\Delta\cup\{\alpha_0\}$ being the simple roots plus the negative highest root of $G^{\vee}$. Any proper subset of $\tilde{\Delta}$ defines a connected reductive subgroup $H^{\vee}\subset G^{\vee}$. Let $H$ and $G$ be the corresponding dual groups. For any special nilpotent orbit $u_H$ in $H$ we can define the Lusztig-Spaltenstein induction $u$ as a nilpotent orbit in $G$. (that is, $(u_H,triv)$ corresponds to some representation of $W_H$ by Springer correspondence, we do the $j$-induction on this to get a representation of $W$, which correspond to $(u,triv)$ for some $u$) 

I am interested in the detailed computation of the generalized Springer theory for spin groups (type B or D). The last sentense in Section 14 of Lusztig's Intersection cohomology complex on a reductive group he wrote "It is likely that, if $(C,\mathcal{E})\in\mathcal{N}_{\chi}^{(0)}$ and $g\in C$, then the sizes of the Jordan cells $\beta(g)\in SO(V)$ give the partition $N=1+5+9+13+...$ or $N=3+7+11+15+...$." In other words, the sizes of Jordan blocks of the unipotent orbits that support those new cuspidal local systems that live in $Spin_N$ but not $SO_N$ were predicted as above. Has this computation been completed somewhere? And if so what are the local systems attached to these orbits? Thanks! 

I know little about literature. But theortically, parabolically induced representations have their characters being parabolic induction of the character from the Levi (see e.g. Sec. 13 of Kottwitz' article in 2003 Clay summer school proceeding). This includes the case of the Steinberg one, since we then know the sum of the character of the trivial one and $St$ (in particular, the result that Paul discussed). On other other hand, when the residue field has charateristic $p$ odd, supercuspidal representations of $PGL_2(F)$ is given (in a bijective way) by a choice of an elliptic torus in $PGL(N)$ (which correspond to one of the three degree $2$ extension $E/F$) together with an suitably "generic" character on $E^{\times}/F^{\times}$. See Howe's tamely ramified supercuspidal representations of $GL_n(F)$, this is known fairly well for $n$ coprime to $p$. If the character on $E^{\times}/F^{\times}$ is tamely ramified, i.e. trivial on $1+p_E$, then the representation is of depth zero and the character can be expressed in terms of the character formula of Deligne-Lusztig for $PGL_2(k)$, $k$ residue field. Otherwise the character is mainly given by the Fourier transform of some elliptic element in the Lie algebra of $PGL_2(F)$, which the Kottwitz article (Sec. 5) also provide an algorithm to compute. I mainly learn the character computation from the character formula article of Adler and Spice, but that is for general groups and I don't think that is a good place to look up if one only want $GL(2)$ or $GL(n)$. 

So I feel like asking the following likely open-ended question: What good generalizations of the notion of Cartan subspace do we have? To be precise, let $G\curvearrowright V$ be an algebraic representation over a field $k$ satisfying some conditions you like (e.g. $\mathrm{char}(k)=0$, $G$ is connected reductive). When can we call a subspace $S\subset V$ a Cartan subspace with a good reason? (hopefully generalizing the notion of Vinberg as duplicated below, at least that of Cartan subalgebras for adjoint representations for sure) My motivation is that I am trying to generalize some work of myself about affine Springer fibers and possibly a bit Springer theory. I end up deciding that the notion of Cartan subspace is essential. - When $\mathrm{char}(k)=0$, $H$ is a reductive group, $\theta$ is an automorphism on $H$ of finite order $m$, $\zeta_m\in k$ is a primitive $m$-th root of unity, $G:=(H^{\theta})^o$, $V:=\mathfrak{h}^{\theta=\zeta_m}$ and $G\curvearrowright V$ comes from the original adjoint representation $H\curvearrowright\mathfrak{h}$, Vinberg defined a Cartan subspace to be a maximal subspace consisting of commuting semisimple elements in $V$. Here commuting means commuting in $\mathfrak{h}$, and semisimple means its $G$-orbit is closed, or equivalently it is semisimple in $\mathfrak{h}$. Vinberg proved that all Cartan subspaces are conjugate, generalizing previous results for symmetric spaces when $m=2$. 

The motivation is for the following question, which in terms is for the interest of orbital integrals: Can we cover the ``compact'' part of a $G(\mathcal{O})$-double cosets by a bounded estimable number of conjugates of $G(\mathcal{O})$? Thanks!
