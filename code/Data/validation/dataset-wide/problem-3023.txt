So, to argue with a person who states, in principle, that all arguments are useless, is to argue with a person that acts in bad faith. If they really believe that all arguments are useless, then they should not argue. If they argue, it means that they don't really believe all arguments are useless. Their practice contradicts their "theory"; they are dissemblers. Anyone who has philosophical convinctions should make at least some effort to live by them. If someone is a Tomist, then they should try to live as a Tomist should live. Conversational solipsists do not do that. They do not try to live by their philosophical "convictions", which they use as a mere tool to discredit everybody else. But they know that our world knowledge, provisional as it is, is working knowledge. They know they shouldn't drink the hemlock, jump from a window at the seventh floor, or cross the street without looking both sides, and they abide by this knowledge. So they, themselves, refute their own points: while those may be "correct" in a completely abstract way, concretely they know better and behave as if they don't believe in them. It is a lazy "philosophy", designed to extricate their proponents from the problems posed by good faith people. So, I would propose a counter-question: even if it is possible to argue against someone as described in the Question, what is the use of it? 

(Edit) On a different note, perhaps there is a confusion between different meanings of the word "individualism". In the most common usage, in which the collectivism x individualism disjunction makes sense, Marx's position isn't either individualist or collectivist; he rejects the disjunctive altogether. For him individuality is only possible in and through society. The isolated individual is an impossibility; s/he would not be able to use tools, speak (and therefore think logically), or even to walk on two feet; s/he wouldn't be human indeed, except in the most basic biological sense. Because these things are learned, and learning is only possible in society. He never argues that society is an entity opposed to, and more important than, individuals. He thinks of "the collective" and "the individual" (to the extent that he would use this flawed terminology) as complementary, not as opposed to each other. But this brings into discussion a different meaning of "individualism", in which it is not the opposite of "collectivism". For 18th century philosophers, it was usual to think of society as an aggregation of individuals, as if grown up men and women, who previously lived in isolation, met together with the conscious intention of founding a society (the famous "social contract"). Thence their reasoning about society was dependent upon what we would call "methodological individualism": individuals predate society, which is an ad hoc agreement between otherwise free individuals. (Note that the above is not the opposite of some "methodological collectivism", which doesn't exist to my knowledge.) In that sense of the word, Marx is decidedly "anti-individualist"; he utterly rejects the hypothesis that society is an ad hoc pact among previously existent human (but a-social) individuals, which he ridicules under the label of "robinsonades". And with good reason; all evidence shows that humans evolved from already social proto-human animals, and that such evolution was only possible because our pre-human ancestors were already social before being human. Methodological individualism, in fact, requires a creationist view of the origin of humans (God created isolated human individuals, which in turn gathered together voluntarily). Maybe wannabe critics of Marx and Marxism confuse those two very different usages of the word "individualism", in order to conclude that Marx had in mind something like the Borg - and perhaps this is the more direct answer to your question, "why is [Marx] interpreted as being anti-individualist": it is a quid pro quo, either naïve or malicious. But anyway, it is sheer ideology, if not merely crude mythology altogether. 

This would be the case of positivism, either in its Comtian semi-religious approach or in its more common sense in the writings of Mill, Spencer, etc. Conversely, to Marx, knowledge is an active (thence "dialectical") process. One view is irreducible to the other, even if there are superficial similarities. 

That would be Augustine's reasoning (or rather, remembrance) that Wittgenstein criticises. But it is hard to agree with Augustine; children definitely do not learn their first language by the method you suggest, which would give them a lexic, but no grammar. I have seen little children babbling, imitating adults in conversation. Their sounds make no sense at all, but what is important is that they have grasped that talking is important, because adults talk. Meaning comes afterward, and it is only secondarily linked to a list of substantive nouns that children learn by heart. Instead, children must first learn to do basic operations such as demand, refuse, accept, call, react to calls, etc. They do not learn to call their mothers "mummy" by someone pointing to their mother and calling her "mummy", they learn it by realising that their mother reacts immediately and joyfully if they emit sounds like "ma", "mo", "mem", "muma", etc. 

All burumbles are wentiful. This garpic is a burumble. (from 1. and 2.) Ergo, this garpic is wentiful. 

Since alienation is at the very kernel of capitalist relations, I don't think it is possible to approach the issue from a pro-capitalist point of view except by denying its existence, or fundamentally misunderstanding it as something different. A critique like you hint at, "socialism and communism would only exasperate alienation if one considers them to be anti-individualistic ideologies" would be an anarchist criticism, or perhaps a primitivist/anti-civilisation one. But this doesn't mean that a right-wing critique of alienation is necessarily impossible - as long as such right-wing is based upon what Marx & Engels call "reactionary socialism", ie, a critique of capitalism based upon nostalgia of older social relations, feudalism, or simple commodity production. This is indeed not a rare thing, the criticism of commodification of social relations as a defence of the "good old times" when capitalist relations of production hadn't yet penetrated and destroyed older, "idyllic" relations - especially family ties, proper respect for the elders, and a sense of "natural" hierarchies. 

From the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (the link provided by @Conifold in his comment to his answer): 

If "genders" are, like it is usually accepted, social constructs built around the biological differences between sexes, then "gender" itself is sexist. If "gender" is just a convoluted synonym for "sex", then no, not all interactions between people of different sexes are of logical necessity sexist - at least in the abstract. But we do not live in an abstract world; we live in a world where the accepted roles and rules for people of each sex are different, unequal, and very strongly enforced - ie, we live in a "gendered" world. So it is like a football field that is higher at one end: nevermind how much "equal" the rules seem, the team that plays from the higher side are at an "automatic" advantage. But this is neither "technical" nor determined by the English language - or any other language, for what is worth. 

The Jabberwocky has a meaning? If so, do the words of the poem necessarily have meaning too, or is it the case that it is a meaningful poem made of meaningless words? The Jabberwocky in the Portuguese translation of Alice in my copy of the book was translated... from English into Portuguese. If it wasn't translated, Brazilian children would be unable to "understand" the Jabberwocky. Oh, of course, they do not "understand" it in the Portuguese version either, but it is obvious that "not understanding" it in Portuguese, because it is a non-sensical poem, is different from "not understanding" it because it is in a foreing language (case in which you would not know that it is a non-sensical poem, for starters). So, in some sense at least, The Jabberwocky is a poem in English, not in Portuguese, Farsi, or Esperanto. And if it is a poem in English, then in some sense the words that make it up must be English or English-like, or perhaps "Englishable". If it is translated into Japanese, then the words of such translation need be related to Japanese in some sense, or it would not be a translation from English to Japanese. So, I am sorry, but 

This doesn't eliminate the "slavery" aspect of the issue, because the decisions about the management of companies would still belong to the capitalists. The worker might in this case decide to not join a given company; but he will have no say on what the company produces, how it organises its production, etc. To really make an effect, the UBI would have to be quite close to the share of each worker in the overall production. That would squeeze profits, and make the continuing of capitalist production impossible; most likely, capitalists would politically react and compel the State to repeal the legislation; if not, the system would crumble, either to be replaced by a socialist system, or into economic disorder. 

seems to be a completely false sentence (at least under the perhaps uncharitable and decontextualised assumption that "only if" means "if and only if"), and not only in the trivial sense that tortilla, guaraná, or Weltanschauung all have meanings but are not English words. The "meaning" of a word is not some essence within it, but is given by context, which is what allows us to create neologisms, and to borrow foreign words. In the context of this answer, I could say that The Jabberwocky is an Alicenation. "Alicenation" is not an English word, and it has no meaning. Or it wasn't and hadn't, up to the moment I coined it in this context. When coined in this context, its "meaning" (and I suppose its "Englishness") is created together with it, and is clear and unmistakable. So the kind of statement such as "a thing is an English word only if it has meaning" seems to fail to grasp the meaning of the word "meaning". 

Yes, it is a contradiction, and it arises from the fact that the statement is self-referent (in saying that nothing is absolute, the statement is also asserting that itself is not absolute). Self-reference will commonly lead to such kind of contradiction. 

incurs in the problems you point. But then this is a meta-statement level 2, ie, a meta-statement about a meta-statement, and any attempt at asserting a level for a meta-statement results in a higher level meta-statement; "this level 546 meta-statement is false" is a level 547 meta-statement. 

What would be a "positive" view of religion? An atheist, at the very least, believes that religions are factually wrong about the existence of God(s), and that would be a "negative" view of religion. An atheist can think that religion, albeit factually wrong is necessary for social control, or for coping with the atrocities of life. But then an atheist who thinks like that would quite certainly be an elitist - someone who believes that some, or most, human beings are not "prepared for the truth". And this isn't likely to make someone prominent. Anyway, a "positive view" can be very limited in scope. Karl Marx, who isn't noted as excessively lenient on religions and religious people, famously wrote that
