We know the both GDP deflator and consumer price index are often used for measuring inflation. Now my question is how a case in which there is a significant difference between them be justified? My another question is that which one of them is more impacted by money supply? 

Can the amount of loans and deposits in entire banking system differ significantly? When regarding the entire banking system, what factors impact the loans to deposits ratio? Is it roughly constant or can change dramatically? Dose the amount of nonperforming loans play a rule in its determination? Can a straightforward equation be drawn for difference between the amount of loans and deposits in entire banking sector by variable like money supply, base money etc.? Based on my understanding of money multiplier concept, there must be a one-to-one relationship between amount of loans and deposits in entire banking system and so the loan to deposit ratio must be roughly constant. Is it true? 

First, the overview: With the fractional reserve system, money/credit is primarily created through loans on deposits but the bank is required to maintain their deposits up to a certain amount (roughly 10% I think). The other primary avenue of money creation is by the Federal Reserve printing money, but there is severe reservations on printing money given past episodes of hyper inflation, though recent events with quantitative easing and large scale asset purchases, the Fed's balance sheet has reached over 4 trillion dollars. The Fed has stated that any profits accumulated from these assets will be reinvested into new securities when they mature and any additional profit will be deposited into the treasury. 

What is the composition of official reserve account? Is it just composed of mere foreign currencies which don’t earn any interest or it is made up of foreign bonds, securities and gold as well? If the latter is the case, does official reserve account overlap with capital account? Another question I have is that can any marked change in this account be regarded as good signal of nation’s currency overvaluation or undervaluation stemming from central bank intervention? 

When discussing panel data, many econometric books, usually, focus just on fixed or random effect model as means of estimating regression for panel data. Despite this tendency I have seen many papers use Fama and MacBeth regression for this purpose, an approach I previously thought its application is constrained to asset pricing models like CAPM. Now my question is: in panel data application, when using Fama and MacBeth regression is preferable over the fixed or random effect model? Is there a statistical test shedding light on this issue? Another question is: in Fama and MacBeth regression can individuals under study be different in different time periods? It would be very kind of you, if you guide me through a link or book dealing whit this subject? 

Here is my question: If the federal reserve were to regulate the banking industry so that fractional requirements were raised to something like 50% on all future deposits, that would have an appreciating effect on the dollar since the rate of increase in the supply of dollars needs to keep up with the growth of the economy every year. If the Fed offsets this appreciation with additional asset purchases by printing money, the Fed's revenue/balance sheet would increase... and over time that excess profit could start to make up the overwhelming portion of the fiscal budget (which could take decades or centuries)... Historical issues with the central bank funding the budget have always resulted in hyper inflation, but with this work around, where the funding of the budget was not coming from the direct printing of money but from the profits from security purchases as they matured, hyper inflation would be avoided, right? 

Greece had a relative large (and inefficent) public sector. At the time of the financial crisis greece wasn´t able to finance it and it reduced the expansion for the public sector. Thus the demand of the public sector was decreasing. And therefore the gdp decreased. The relative small private sector wasn´t able to compensate the decrease of the public sector. Additionally the private sector wasn´t, and still isn´t, very competitive. This cannot be changed very quickly, if a country cannot depreciate it´s currency. That´s why some people say, that a Grexit is the only way, that greece could manage the crisis. In the past years Greece is trying to get competitive in the euro zone. But this is a difficult way. Greece has to produce more high quality goods. To achieve this, greece has to make the "right" reforms education sector, taxation, public services, etc. But it is taking a long time that these reforms make the greece economy competitive. Ireland had a relative large financial sector. Therefore Ireland has hit hard by the financial crisis. Because of the recovering of the worldwide financial industry in the past years ireland was able to grow. 

This is in essence what the Japanese have been doing with paying off Government debt in order to prevent their currency from appreciating naturally (instead of raising reserve requirements), right? Response (wasn't allowed to respond at length so I'm making an edit to my original post): Lending would have "some" reductions, but it wouldn't be as severely impacted as it would if it weren't offset by more asset purchases, purchases that are then deposited into banks, expanding the monetary base which then expands the amount to be lent out... There's also the argument that, by replacing tax's with the profits from maturing assets, there would be a stimulating effect on GDP, which would cause the dollar to appreciate, which would then require more printing or lending to maintain stable prices... though of course it would take a significant amount of time for profits on maturing assets to become a sizable portion of the fiscal budget, but of course the FED isn't purchasing securities with the idea of maximizing revenue so I'd imagine their rate of return could get a little better if they really tried and this where to become a primary mandate... I'm definitely not saying raising the supply of dollars increases their value, the opposite actually... My argument says raising reserve requirements would reduce the supply of dollars, but printing would offset this reduction, maintaining the equilibrium. I suppose an implicit assumption I didn't spell out was that the amount of dollars printed would not equal the number of dollars no longer being lent out since fractional banking has the multiplier effect, i.e. today one dollar created by the FED is equivalent to 9~10 dollars lent out in the banking system. 

In economic textbooks, it is argued that in fractional reserve banking, the reserve requirement put a brake on the money banking system can create such that it can at most be the product of base money and 1/(reserve requirement ratio). Now my question is that can the possibility of securitization by allowing banks to make more loans and putting them out of their balance sheets, give them the ability to create more money than traditional approach implies? In the other words, in this case, can the maximum of money multiplier be greater than 1/(reserve requirement ratio)? 

Can anyone give me an intuitive explanation why it is often argued that market cannot clear (i.e. supply and demand of something does not match and there is no equilibrium, so the market gets mired in state of rationing) if assumption of perfect and costless information does not hold (see, for example, New Paradigm in Macroeconomics written by Werner)? In these situations, how we can realize is it the supply or demand which has been rationed?) 

The total ordering cost are $TC(Q)=P\cdot a+\frac{a\cdot K}{Q}+\frac{h\cdot Q}{2}$ If K=0 TC becomes $TC(Q)=P\cdot a+\frac{h\cdot Q}{2}$ P\cdot a is a constant. Let denote it as c. $TC(Q)=c+\frac{h}{2}Q$ You can see that TC is a straight line with a slope of $\frac{h}{2}$ and a domain of $Q \in \mathbb R^+$. The marginal cost is $\frac{dTC}{dQ}=\frac{h}{2}$ It is a constant. Therefore there is no single optimum order quantity. The store has a capacity. This is the upper limit of the order. If you have still some goods in the store the maximum order is the capacity (c) minus the goods in the store (x). Therfore you can order bewtween $0$ (exclusive) and $c-x$ (inclusive) goods. The total cost of inventory will be always the same for a given demand in a period.
