Just a quick question when summer came. I usually play 5 to 6 matches on beach volleyball tournaments and there is 35 Celsius degrees in the shadow but of course there is no shadow on the field. Sometimes you can even burn your feets by hot sand if you are not using neoprene socks. For example last 2 matches I usually experience cramps in my calfs. So many full-power jumps during last 4 matches cruelly decided. How to alleviate these? Do you use any special drinks during such an excessive performance (instead of hypotonic iont drinks and a lot of water)? Salt? Magnesium? I know harder training can help here but what can I do in terms of supplementation? 

Question is quite simple. I'm looking for gym-specific bunch of exercises which can help me to build up swimming performance/endurance/speed. So, when I'm not in the water I can still be continuously improving my swimming. Of course I know that I need to go into water because of technique training, feel of water etc. Edit: focused on crawl performance. Not interested in strength improvement in other styles at this moment. 

Basically started with the low bar squat (following StrongLift 5*5) but being very skinny (179 cm, 58 KG) the bar doesn't rest at the shelf created in scapula as described by Mark Rippetoe in this video. If I try going that low, the bone hurts there. This led me to squat with the bar a little up, somewhere on the traps, which qualifies for the high bar squat. Things went smoothly till now, when for the last couple of workouts I noticed a mild knee pain afterwards, its just some sensation that I know goes away with rest. Secondly as the weight has got a bit heavier the current bar placement also feels on the bone, which I guess causes the thumb to go numb after the workout. Here is the video I shot today to check my form. Please advice me for these two issues and point out things that I can do to improve my squats and bear more weight. 

I've been swimming for 1,5 year and 4 times per week in average. I had a period of 6-7 trainings during a week and with spring coming I switched 2-3 trainings to running finally because this is simply more fun and unfortunately I've found myself to be sick of swimming at the end of winter. I'm amateur not professional swimmer. That's why my goal is to be fit and have fun. But I want to improve my performance too, of course. I was asked to participate in 500 m free style amateur swimming race. The problem is that I'm sprinter. I really VERY enjoy fast speed and my favourite distance is 50 and 100 m. And I would say this is the reason why I like swimming. Experience that beautiful feeling of literally cutting water in a high speed. I use short fins or/and swimming paddles very often during my workout. I simply internally LOVE 50-100 m of burst then some time of rest and doing these intervals again and again. I know what to do, I know how to train. My question is more likely psychological. How to force my mind not sprinting the first 100 m of 500 m race and not totally exhaust myself so I'm not able to finish a race in a good time? Of course I'm able to swim 500 m but I find it very boring, very slow and I can't enjoy it now with current mind set. How you are dealing with is? Is it possible to switch my mind and body set from sprinter to long race swimmer? 

22/M/55kg/176cms My last StrongLift 5*5 workout was on 28th Nov 2014, and I weighed 58.2 Kgs then. Since then I haven't worked out one bit and my diet is getting less by day (at least thats what I am feeling like) evident from my current weight. Why I left- To concentrate on my job which involves- sitting for long hours at one place for 10 hours, 5 days a week. (Software Engineer) Now I feel it was a bad decision, for a month or so I pulled alright without working out, but now I feel kind of unmotivated and lethargic and strangely a bit weaker. Just as I was weighing in today, I decided to screw job and focus on my body, I want to get back at lifting, same StrongLift 5*5 program from the start, but I want to change my nutrition part. This is where I need help, I want to build a diet regime, I want to eat those proper carbs and proteins 7 days a week. Please help me build that and recommend me sources from where I can even get ideas on what to cook. Please help me get back with a bang. Thanks :) 

For me it looks quite simple: All calisthenics (= exercise using only one's body weight for resistance) will lead to toning your body as opposed to for example bench press with heavy weights which should result in the distinctly bigger chest muscles. Keep going with your push ups, no worries. 

I've met physical education teacher in the swimming pool and he told me that swimming will NOT have significant effect for developing my vertical jump. If we omit weight loss caused by swimming and better core muscles stability, can swimming help in developing leg (vertical jump) specific muscle groups? Or swimming (crawl) is focused on developing exactly contra non-water-sports muscle groups? 

You are talking about a nap for a whole 1 hour. Actually, this is not a true nap. Nap is about 20 minutes long, depends on personal preferences but the rule is that you (better say your brain) should stay in REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleeping phase. From my personal point of view, the best solution for your situation is to have a 20 minutes nap and then 40 minutes hard workout. This worked for me every time. During afternoon hours one hour of sleeping can be total waste of your time. You will probably get up more "damaged" than you were before lying into the bed. Some tips: You should know how long you need to fall asleep. For me (afternoon, after work etc.) is about 5 minutes. So I go to the bed and set my timer to 25 minutes to make sure I will be sleeping no longer than 20 minutes and will not miss the end of my very first REM phase. My 2 cents :) 

My current body weight is 57 KG (125.6 pounds) and am 179 cms tall. I am on stronglift 5*5 and my squat weight has reached 110 pounds and deadlift at 155 pounds, while the weights for other exercises are comparatively lower than my body weight, I'd like to know what would be the correct weight to start wearing a belt while squatting and deadlifting or even consider wearing a belt at all? The idea of wearing a belt came to my mind because I noticed some lower back soreness today, which has never happened before. Also I am wondering if the belt provides some support to the back, all I know is that it gives your abs something to push to. 

My workout routine is as follows: Chest/Biceps Legs Back/Triceps Shoulders and Legs again. I want to include some good core/ab exercises, please recommend some and tell me on which routines should I add them. I am a skinny person, looking to build mass. I weigh 57 Kgs and am 180 cm tall. In the past I have been doing planks, crunches, decline board sit up, leg raises. Also is it possible for me have those engraved ab muscles? 

This is maybe the most important question on this site! (For runners, volleyball players, basketball players, jumpers etc. etc.) Thank you for this. I was fighting with my Jumper's knee for 2 years. Why I experienced this? 5 volleyball amateur trainings per week (too young and too eager!) + no special supplementation + no coach + no compensation exercise. I was even thinking about giving up this beautiful sport. What's now? I'm jumping without any support and playing again at full blast! How to get rid of it in initial phase or prevent it? The key is your quadriceps femoris muscle. You need to exercise and strengthen it EVERY SINGLE DAY! See this video from 1:45 the first exercise -- slightly rotated leg lifting. $URL$ You can do it while waiting on the bus stop (while standing), you can do it in your work while sitting, you can do it whenever and anywhere you want to and anyone don't tell me that you can't! Only this one worked for me. I wish you good luck. I hope you will catch it in the initial phase and cure it totally. 

For several weeks now, I have noticed a mild pain on my right knee after squats, I am on strong lifts 5*5, 57Kg/179cm/M. My squats weight reached 115 lbs but for the last two sessions have brought it down to 95 lbs to see if the pain is still there. Although its nothing like a pain that stops me from daily activities, but its more kind of a sensation that occurs during the day. Upon searching about the form, I did the following things, I squat like I am about to sit on a chair, I discarded tennis shoes and used flat shoes, I keep my feet at 30 degrees and shoulder width apart. Please advice me what can I do to avoid this pain and keep increasing weight seamlessly, thanks! 

I have heard various powerlifters on youtube to use the leg drive(1) and keep your shoulder blades tucked in or together throughout the rep(2) (just as we do on the low bar squats) while doing the bench press. I am on stronglift 5*5, 22/M/58Kg/179CM, and as the weight is increasing gradually I want to learn how to use the legs as stabilizers on the bench press, even though I have them in correct position I am not able to generate any force with them. Secondly, a common recommendation is to keep your hips glued to the bench, back arched and shoulder blades as tucked as possible to prevent unnecessary shoulder use, I have been trying this but it seems I loose this tension mid way. But today I noticed this all the more because I felt some abnormal sensation in my right shoulder (maybe the rotator cuff). Please help me achieve 1 and 2 effectively. 

My girlfriend has long hair as well. She is using just regular swimming cap and she usually do something like a bun with her hair. $URL$ If you are not a male lion, you should be ok with a regular swimming cap. You just need to use something to tight your hair to be able to put it under your cap comfortably. 

Thank you for edit which provides important information. I'd say that your weight is ok for 187 cm sport man. If you are afraid of injuries you can try to use your forefoot while running. Your arch will automatically and NATURALLY absorb shocks. This type of running will lead to stronger calf muscles too. Or you can run on the beach where sand is absorbing shocks pretty well. Proper warm up is a must of course. You are in a very good situation when even thinking about, let's say, 3 days running + 3 days swimming and 1 day rest. That's the ideal training ever. I'm very eager swimmer and as time goes by I experience more fun and more performance when I go "out of water" for some days. Combining swimming, running and gym for compensation exercise is the best way for long term sustainability. That's all about providing necessary rest for particular muscle groups. Your legs (after hard run) will relax inside of water and vice versa. During running our arms, back and shoulders will taking a good rest and will be ready for tomorrow swimming again. You can combine these 2 in one day but I'd suggest you to run first and then go to the water so your muscles, again, can take a rest and relax. Water pressure provides something like continuous massage. Plus, there is another big advantage here too. This will be FUN for a long time. When you are swimming 6-7 times per week you are tired and you can find this boring. Maybe you can be even sick of it and experience very unpleasant burn out. (Ok, depends on motivation, competition etc. etc...) When doing 2 activities (maybe 3 actually: including push ups, pull ups after run) your workout will never be boring routine. So good luck, keep moving and keep your very healthy life style! EDIT: when to do what: just rotate your activities every day to avoid repeating one workout in 2 days. I'd plan my week like this: run+body, swim, run+body, swim, run+body, relax swim, rest. 

I am on stronglift 5*5 and as the weight is increasing with each workout, squats are getting challenging, while the program is really good, I want to keep doing it and avoid any injuries. The other day after squatting I felt some pain in my left shoulder, it got me worried about my form. After watching a few videos, I think my bar position might be causing this pain. The Mark Ripetoe Video says that the elbows should come back to create that shelf with the posterior deltoid, while this video by OmarIsuf very clearly demonstrates that elbows should be inline with the body. My question is how do I figure out what is the correct bar position for me? And how does it feel when the bar is correctly positioned. Another complication is that guys in these videos have fully developed deltoids so they can create that shelf very easily, I am very skinny with almost no deltoids, so it hurts my bones with the weight gets heavy and is wrongly placed. As it had happened while doing high bar on local trainers advice. So please tell me how to perfect the low bar squat. Thanks!
