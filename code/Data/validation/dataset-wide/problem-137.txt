Use extremely caustic materials like $ LiOH $ or $ H_2SO_4 $ that work well on organic chemicals. I figured out the quantity once but don't feel up to doing that today. Just remember the acid/base is consumed in the reaction and some of the weight of the acid/base is the water in which it is in solution. So estimate the weight of chemicals required at 150% of the body weight. Bad Stuff The problem is this will not dissolve all the bits of the human body. I assume someone looking for this method of "disposing of evidence" would know what to look for if they found several empty drums of caustic chemicals. You could do the same thing with metals and other materials. However, the best caustic chemicals for a given task change depending upon the composition of the object to be destroyed and the container in which you plan to do the destruction. Also, as stated above, this will take days to complete and it will stink to high heaven. You'll probably need a gas mask to enter the room during the destruction.

I'm not a gunsmith nor am I a precision machinist, so my opinion may be worth what you paid for :P Although the concept was around long before they became widely used, breech loaders didn't become popular until some manufacturing problems were solved. 

Probably not I'm going with the contrarian view on this one. I'm not arguing that there's no plausible reason for a nomadic space civilization to develop, I'm arguing that it wouldn't be physically practical to do this. Industrial Base Think about the industrial base that the United States requires to keep its space infrastructure going. With 150 million workers in the largest economy of the world, the US can barely (with the help of Japan, EU, & Russia) keep a single modest space station going. Still some of the population complains about the effort of keeping that outpost running. Consider the economy as a pyramid of workers. Each level provides a necessary level of infrastructure to keep the higher levels running. The base level might be providing basic goods and services for survival (e.g. food & water). In such an economy, space infrastructure and its components will always be at or near the top. So how do you maintain such a huge industrial pyramid when your entire labor forces lives on the infrastructure it is maintaining? Additional Layers In addition to the problem mentioned above, remember that your nomadic civilization also has to contend with the necessity of providing much more for its work force just to keep it alive. Now providing power, air, water, radiation, etc. (all of these things provided "free" on a planet) requires additional layers of labor to provide to your citizens. After providing for all of these things, how much of your labor force is left to create microchips, 6-axis NC machines, medicine, doctors, septic tank pumpers, etc.? 

A Universal Translator requires computers capable of Natural Language Parsing (Processing). A natural language parser attempts to deconstruct/parse a natural human language into an abstract language neutral form and then process that for meaning. Once it knows what has been communicated, it searches its database for a translation into the target language. To an extent something like this is already done for documentation that must be produced for multiple languages. A special XML language (usually SGML or something like it) is used. Different tags are used to denote the same section but in a different language. When "loading" the document, you specify the tags to use (e.g. Spanish) and the document's Spanish version of the sections are rendered so the user only sees those. But current SGML document construction is not done automatically - instead it is done by people, but processed by machines. Writing code to deconstruct a language so that a computer can understand it and then match that with an expression construct from another language has been a sort of Holy Grail of language processing for decades - and it is a very tough problem. 

Modern technological humans discovered a need for concentrated nutrient foods for people with ill health, have problems with digestion, or who are malnourished. You can find this food in your grocery store under the brand name $ Ensure^{TM} $ (among others). What I see in this 237 g bottle is: 

Top Speeds Top speeds for current era (CE) ships using water jets as their propulsion is typically in the 30-60 knot range (far short of the desired 300 km/hour). 

Safety! In the book The Killing Star, the authors point out that any species capable of making a sublight interstellar ship is easily capable of killing its neighbors. So as soon as Humans demonstrate the requisite technologies, the neighbors show up to force Humans to act responsibly. 

As the previous answers have indicated, cadet is usually a rank reserved for personnel still in training, typically with no out of classroom experience. The description you give though is one of advanced training given to personnel have already proven they've mastered the basics (e.g. special forces training). Basic Skills Your "troopers" should have mastered all the basic skills. The should be familiar with and able to use all equipment they would normally encounter in their job. If the equipment is the right type (e.g. survival equipment), they should be able to use the equipment without thinking about it. Advanced Skills In the training you describe, your troopers will learn advanced skills to make them more valuable team members to the CO's team. This might be hacking, sniper, demolitions, close combat fighting, communications/cryptographic, etc. Which skills they would learn would depend upon the role of the unit and its likely needs as well as where that particular trooper fits in the unit. You can expect each team member to be in the top 5+% of the population in these skills. In most cases, all unit members will be at a minimum competent fighters in a wide range of skills. Survival/Environmental Skills Your "troopers" will learn to survive and accomplish their mission in a wide range of environments which include all of those they're likely to encounter during their mission plus many they aren't likely to encounter. If this means running around on an icy Moon of Jupiter, suitable training for that mission will be provided. EE training Escape and evasion training. If your troopers will receive training about what to do if they become separated from the unit, how to operate to decrease their chances of getting capture and what to do if they are captured by enemy forces. Interrogation Resistance Troopers entrusted with very valuable information may receive training on how to resist torture. The goal isn't to prevent them from revealing the information but in delaying it. Hopefully it's delayed enough that your team isn't harmed by the release of information.
