This may not seem like very many, but these were just fleets. Not every raid would have been recorded. Many were small raids, a warlord with a few ships, but others involved 200+ ships. Viking ships of the time are estimated to have carried between 30 and 40 men (though some ships may have been larger) so we can arrive at some tentative estimates for the sizes of raiding parties and armies when we know how many ships were involved. RELIABILITY OF THE SOURCES Terrifying and brutal though these raids must have been, Asa Briggs writes in ‘A Social History of England’ that

In short, pottery played a huge role in most societies, in economic terms as well as in culture and society. Telling us about the Past Nava Panitz-Cohen of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem sums this up neatly: 

Another source (M & H. Whittock) says that, in Ireland between 795 and 820, only 26 of 113 attacks were carried by Vikings. The authors then add 

Pottery as evidence of daily life in Ancient Greece (circa 520-500 BC). This shows women getting water at a 'fountain house'. In summary, I think it would be fair to say that the critical importance of pottery in archaeology, rather than leading historians to overestimate its importance, has enabled them to understand the importance of other items of past peoples’ lives which have not survived.

In the case of the Greeks, there are a number of sources citing this. Anne Margaret Wright in City States, while noting that we don’t exactly know what Greek music sounded like, says,

(my highlighting) It seems that Hoeter is referring to the same judges as the other sources (but I could be wrong). Later in the article he mentions "revenue from fines" but it's not clear from the context if that money went to the judges or to the crown. If to the former, this would surely be open to serious abuse. 

At the Furlo Pass in the Apennines, the Via Flaminia passes through a tunnel built in 76 - 77 AD during the time of Emperor Vespasian, replacing an earlier tunnel. 

According to $URL$ the first Latin translation was commissioned by Pope Nicholas V and completed in 1452 by Lorenzo Valla. The image below is from the first page of the first book. My Latin is below basic, but the first line seems interesting, a specific reference to 'Peloponnesian War'. 

Source: Garcia According to Ribbentrop, Franco also feared reprisals (e.g. losing the Canaries) from Britain if Spain helped Germany. Thus, it is not hard to see why Hitler found Franco so stubborn about not letting German troops into Spain. Franco wanted an Axis victory, but not to the extent that it might compromise Spanish interests. Without Spanish cooperation, Operation Felix was pretty much a non-starter as the military costs for Germany would have been too high. Likewise, Operation Felix-Heinrich never happened due to reversals on the Eastern front. 

It is true that the British passed legislation which limited the number of slaves a ship could carry but this was not until 1788 (The Dolben Act), by which time British ships had already transported more than 2.5 million of the estimated final total of 3.26 million slaves. These rates seem very much at variance with the proportions quoted in the question. Either the museum presented ships with higher than average mortality rates, and / or they included deaths for a certain period either before and / or after embarkation and disembarkation. I think the most likely reason for the apparent discrepancy is that the museum focused on earlier ships when mortality rates were much higher. The vast majority of slaves were shipped during the period 1700 to 1850, by which time death rates had been as much as halved compared to the pre-1700 period (for both slaves and crew). If we look at mortality rates for earlier periods of French slave trading, we can find numbers which approach a 25% mortality rate. According to James Pritchard, David Eltis, and David Richardson in 'The Significance of the French Slave Trade' 

In August 1939 (just before the outbreak of war), Hitler told Neville Henderson, the British Ambassador, 

Several hundred years later, the amount of furniture of at least a reasonable quality was still quite limited judging by this passage relating to the time of Henry III (1216 - 1272): 

After trawling through hundreds of coin images, I am reasonably sure that the emperor depicted in the coin in the question is Antoninus Pius (138 - 161 AD). In the compilation below, the top left coin is the one in the question. The other coins are all confirmed as Antoninus Pius (perhaps to hide the rather prominent chin?). 

THE PHILIPPINES On the island of Palawan, the Puerto Princesa Underground River (provisionally one of the New7Wonders of Nature) was known about but not used. 

This made putting the unit of currency on coins unnecessary, though that is not to say that none of these had a face value indicated. If this page on Roman coins is anything to go by, it seems the Romans never indicated a currency or face value on their coins, and it seems that British coins from, for example, the reign of Henry VIII also did not. Despite extensive googling (including several Wikipedia pages and also this timeline), I've been unable to find out when coins first showed currency or face value. The above cited article mentions 'the end of the last century' but there is a Louis XVI coin from 1791 which shows a face value of 30 sols. This British coin from 1798 (George III - farthing) also suggests otherwise: 

Thus, there was a significant difference as to how the Greeks viewed the Persians before and after Plataea, although it is also true that the Spartans (typically) had little time for Persian luxury and perceived softness even before Marathon. As to the view of most modern historians, the view is not that the Persians were poor soldiers but that the Persian infantry was at a huge disadvantage when facing up to the heavily armoured Greeks under certain conditions (and the lack of Persian armour described here would hardly have caused their Greek opponents to be fearful):

A year later, in the wake of the failed Munich Beer Hall putsch in November 1923, Mussolini reportedly referred to Hitler and his associates as 'buffoons.'

INCOME The sources of the funds of these three financial ‘bodies’ is either not entirely clear and / or varied at different times. Funds for the Aerarium Saturni came from taxes, tributes, customs and various other sources.
