In a nutshell, I think you're right. The crux of your professor's argument is that, according to the classical dichotomy, the real interest rate will remain unchanged. However, that is only true in the long run, and we shouldn't be looking at the long run for this question. We should be looking at the short run. In the long run, the nominal interest rate as well as the inflation rate will remain unchanged, so the real interest rate will remain unchanged. In the short run, the nominal interest rate will decrease, which increases output (according to the Investment-Saving relation) and causes inflation (according to the Aggregate Supply relation). In the medium run, with output above its natural level, wages will rise due to a shortage of labour and thus prices will increase further. This happens until output is back at its natural level. This increase in price reduces the real stock of money as well, so that the nominal interest rate returns back to its original level according to the Investment-Saving relation (a leftwards shift of money supply in the money market). In the long run, with prices stable at a higher level, there are no further increases in prices, so inflation becomes 0. (This is a static model, whereas in the real world the economy is dynamic and constantly experiences price increases.) Thus, real interest increases back to its original level. 

Is there non-partisan (academically accepted) theory of intrinsic value of labour? Everyday observations say that market prices do not reflect the true value of labour for some professions. E.g. scientists who work in fundamental science contributes greatly to the development of society and industries (e.g. Google Page Rank algorithm works due to Frobenius-Perron theorem), nevertheless they receive very modest pay even in developed countries. Great artists can be neglected during their lifetime but their art can be worth millions some years later. And even more - scientists sometimes make discoveries that can be acknowledged only centuries later. E.g. art scientists and musicologs are among the lowest paid professions (their pay can sometimes be equal to shop assitants' pay) but their theories about aesthetics can be of crucial importance now that development of artificial (general) intelligence and computational creativity requires philosophical and aesthetical answers on the questions "what is art?", "what is valuable art?", "what is semantics of art?". And even more. Theologians are other very poorly paid profession but advent of artificial intelligence requires first-principle theories about norms governing robots and artificially intelligent agents. And computational theology and applied philosophy can provide the basic answers, e.g. what self-driving cars should do in morally conflicting situations. So - how can we estimate the true value of labour and should we acknowledge that market price not always capture the true value of labour? Wiki has some entries about Marx theory of labour value, but I am seeking some non-partisan and widely accepted theory. 

The straight-line supply and demand curves can be thought of as a magnification of this graph, where the two intersect. Thus, the units on the axes would give you a clue as to how high up the graph is being drawn, or how far to the right (if the units start at a number other than 0 or skip an interval). This shows you why they are indeed called 'curves', even when they are sometimes straight lines. Supply and demand curves are drawn using straight lines for simplicity. For example, two straight-line equations may be given, from which it is relatively simple to calculate the point of intersection. In the real world Supply and demand curves are an approximation of what happens in real life. The curves are a simplified model which show the general trend in the two functions. In reality, supply and demand curves are approximated using data that is collected over many years, with many short-term variables affecting the results, if the curves are even drawn up at all (the curves are more a theoretical model than a calculative method). Economic factors which affect supply and demand 

Are there research (and stories more broadly) about professional open source companies? To what types of products their are appropriate, what licensing schemes to choose? How to managed patents and IP? How to motivate and build HR and how to attract volunteer community? How to involve academia in the project? How to organise ownership and how to achieve profitability? What is the past performance of the professional open source companies - what success stories and what failures, what are lessons learned? This question seems to be quite broad, but the subject is nascent and therefore narrow. That is why this question is focused and narrow as well. 

There is trend to arrive at "single customer view" - combine all the available quantitative and qualitative data about single customer. How to organize those data for using in prediction and anylsis? My guess is that all the data should be used for calibration of parameters of some model. But what models are available for representing single customer preferences and behavior? Does agent models from computer science (e.g. BDI - Beliefs-Desires-Intentions) can be used? Maybe neuroecnomics can be of help for building up such models (using choice, cost un intemporal discount functions)? 

Reading my development economics textbook, I was informed that the opportunity cost of a private investment is the market value of the wages, goods and services used for the investment. Here's a hypothetical situation: suppose that the firm could invest in an alternative project with the same amount of resources but a higher return. Would it not be myopic to overlook this alternative investment when asserting that the opportunity cost is the market value of inputs? It leads me to wonder why the inputs weren't valued higher. It could be because others in the market don't have access to capital, knowledge of the opportunity or the expertise required to make the investment. Still, why would the opportunity cost not be the income that could potentially be created from the alternative investment? Is a 'market value' approach just a simplification? 

If the demand for loanable funds decreases, investment increases because the real interest rate decreases. Isn't that a contradiction, because loanable funds are used for investment, and a decrease in demand for loanable funds must come from a decrease in investment? 

There are folklore stories that investments in human capital have saturation level beyond which the marginal return decreases to zero. My questions are - are there measurements how closely the saturation level has been achieved in developed and almost developed countries and have the developed and almost developed countries exhausted all the necessities to make investments in human capital. I.e. my question is - why there are so few investments in human capital in developed and nearly developed countries, do the decision makers believe that the saturation level has been achieved and there is no expected return possible for the further investments? My feeling is that the current decision makers are not fair and that there can be really great return from the additional investment in the human capital but such investments are not being made due to some factors (e.g. due to lobbying efforts by primitive businesses which need primitive and cheap labor). Therefore I am seeking scientifically sound view on this problem. 

Re-order the equation. $U=x-\frac 1 y\\ x-U=\frac 1 y\\ y=\frac 1{x-U}$ I'm sure you know how to draw that graph: 

Elasticities tell economists how responsive changes in price are to changes in quantity, and this is useful because it tells you whether revenue will increase or decrease. Suppose you are the owner if a firm that is interested in expanding. It will be more informative for you to know that if you expand your production by 20%, the prices of your products will decrease by only 10% than to know that if you produce two more units per week, the price will drop by $1.00. The first description is informative because it tells you whether your revenue will increase or not (in this case it will, because demand is price elastic), whereas the second is an absolute reference which requires further calculation in order to understand what it means for your business. 

In our country we have 25% personal income tax on labour, 15% corporate tax on corporations and 10% personal income tax on income from capital (e.g. dividends). Pundits in our country are saying that we have flat tax rate across all types of income, because - they are saying - 15% corporate tax and 10% capital income tax amounts to the 25% tax on the income from the capital. Are their analysis correct? This question leads to the following question - does return in capital (after taxes) depneds on the corporate tax rate? What empirical analysis and models are saying about this? From the one hand - it seems that corporate tax have impact on the gains after corporate tax from the other hand - maybe free market reprices the capital in such manner that the return on capital (after corporate tax) does not depend on the corporate tax rate? Does the tax system of our country is just, normal, appropriate and similar to for the developed Western democracy country? I feel that to speak about flat (equal) taxation we should have 25% tax on all the types of income and we should not take into account the corporate tax when considering personal income tax. How this analysis proceeds in Western democracies? Or should we speak about price/earning share ratio as the most sensible measure of return on capital - does this ratio depend on the corporate tax? 

I recommend Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel, for this topic. I don't know what you mean by "the society." Diamond makes it clear that there are many different societies around the world, progressing at different rates. To answer your question about why we have what we have today and why individual societies developed in the direction they did: some technologies are inevitable, such as farming, writing and mettalurgy. What differs is that a few societies developed these technologies much earlier than others. Diamond lays out the reasons why; differences in intelligence across races is not a reason but the geology and biogeography of people's habitats are ultimate causual factors. These ultimate factors lead to more proximate factors such as animal and plant domestication, leading to denser and more sedentary populations with more complex political organization. Technological development led to further economic development, with most technology arising from it being spread from other societies—and that transmission depends again on geography. Eurasia had the advantage of an east-west axis that made transfer of domestic food and animal species easier (along the same lines of latitude and hence similar climes), and thus the technology which accompanies more sedentary societies. More isolated societies such as Australia did not benefit from the spread of technology, and hence remained a hunting-gathering society until European conquest. His book is entertaining and interesting to read. I've learnt facts and a perspective of the differences amongst races that I couldn't do without. 

So - my question is - how economics and policy planning is responding to these trend. Are there research trends, topics, journals, important monographs with such perspective? I feel that the current developments put the developed nations in the situation that is somehow similar to developing countries - in need to increase competitiveness and in need to correct social issues raised by unequal social development. So - these topics should be researched. I know that I have raised many different topics in my question, but my aim is not to receive separate answer on any of those topics. My aim is to get the name and references to the research trend which answers those questions. 

Contrary to the common view, the physics is all about models, there are no such thing as law of nature, because every physical law has its applicability range and therefore all of laws as models. But any physical law derives from one principle - $URL$ - any particle theroy (there are hundreds of them) is written as the model Lagrangian and then variational principle is applied to arrive at dynamical equations and observable quantities that can be corroborated in experiments. My question is - is there similar approaches, theories, most general models in economics from which every other model or economic law can be applied. If there are such models, then the automation of economics can be achieved (assuming that the automation of mathematics will be completed, e.g. with project $URL$ I have heard definition - the economics is a tuple <...> but I can not remember the book or article or the content of this tuple. Usually such tuples contain t]general mathematical objects: sets of agents with preference functions, set of interaction mechanisms (market system, competition patterns (monopoly etc.)), sets of external shocks (endogeneous factors) and so on... I am seeking more for literature references, trends, keywords, not exhaustive answer. I can further research question by my own, but I should be informed from where to start my efforts. Macroeconomics can (and should) be derived from the microeconomics, therefore I am seeking the model that states first principles - general microeconomic model (from which the general macro models could also be derived in the best case).
