"Sorry I cannot join you, I don't have the budget for it right now." I would be honest and straightforward with my coworkers. Since you say you're quite careful with money, I'm going to assume you have a budget. If the amount you have in your budget for food (or entertainment or whatever you want to classify these outing as) is too small to regularly go on these outings with coworkers, then you can simply and honestly say "It's not in my budget." It doesn't matter whether your salary means that you could have the budget for it - your other financial goals/priorities make it such that there is not room in your budget for the kind of outings your coworkers prefer. I'd be honest about it being a money issue for a few reasons. First, by being clear it's about your budget, you can reassure your coworkers that it isn't a matter of you not wanting to socialize with them. Second, it provides you with the opportunity to participate in some of the social events as you feel comfortable. Third, it is possible that your coworkers are willing to compromise with you, and choose more affordable places to go for their outings. Due to the nature of the situation it's possible that your coworkers will take this response (or any response) poorly. At its core this is an issue of differing values/priorities. Your financial values appear to be in conflict with those of your coworkers. I think being aware of that and trying to present your reasoning in a manner that doesn't make judgments about their financial values can help prevent hard feelings. 

I see suslik answered about the Bose QC-15 headphones, and I would like to improve on that answer a bit. I actually am using the QC-15 at work every day. And they are simply amazing. It is true that while turned on, without any music, they do not cancel out conversations going on right next to you. But they do lower the volume of those quite a bit. And by playing music in the earphones, even at a very low volume, you will hear nothing of the conversations going on right next to you, at all. I very easily get distracted by conversations among my peers, even if I am not addressed. And some tasks I cannot perform well with music, I really need silence. But I found that the solution with very low music and noise-cancelling earphones works really well for me. 

First of all this is behavior you should stop doing. You might be ashamed of your grades, but worst case is they turn you down. By not replying you are forcing them to turn you down. Stop caring about their decision, just send the grades when they ask. You have already explained why you grades are not as good as they might have been, and that explanation seems to have been acknowledged. Second to answer your question, I don't think you can gain anything from offering an explanation. Simply reply with: "My grades are attached, sorry for the delay." If you start saying that you are ashamed and that is why you didn't respond timely, they will think this is behavior that will be reflected in the job. I.e. that you will stick you head in the ground when faced with situations that you are not proud of (and there will probably be several of those), instead of handling the situation to the best of your abilities. This is not a good trait. 

I would not include the fact that you started programming at age 8 on your resume. Every item you list on your resume should be something that demonstrates your value as an employee. You list your previous jobs because it demonstrates that you are experienced, you list your certifications because it demonstrates that you are knowledgeable, you list your work organizing a charity drive at your previous job because it demonstrates that you can take initiative and be a leader, etc. With that in mind, you need to consider what you are trying to demonstrate by mentioning that you were 8 when you first learned to code, and also what prospective employers might perceive that as demonstrating. Presumably you see that fact as demonstrating that you have a lot of experience around programming and are good at learning things on your own. However, as Vietnhi Phuvan's answer shows, prospective employers might interpret that fact differently. Given the potential for potential employers to draw negative conclusions from that fact, I would not include the fact that you first learned to code at age 8, but rather find a different way to communicate the values you wish to demonstrate. 

As is the case with requesting anything from an employer, you need to show your employer how it is to their benefit to give you what you are asking for. In this case that means that you need to demonstrate to your employer that getting two more weeks of work from you will benefit them less than letting you go immediately. The main benefit that the employer gets is not paying you for two weeks worth of work, but the fact that you have this job means that in general the employer views the work that you do as more valuable to the company than the money they pay you. So in order to convince them otherwise, it seems to me that you need to make it clear that the work you will be doing in your final two weeks will be of lower quality than usual, and thus is not worth the company's money. In other words, I don't think there is a way that you can get your employer to let you go immediately without burning bridges. 

Your contract makes it clear: no other "occupation or business". Having a garage sale is not a business; even the IRS says so. Selling regularly on Amazon is likely to be a business; selling one used item is not. The IRS says, at $URL$ 

Another way to look at it is to consider whether that activity might be something you'd want treated as a business if it's profitable. You can't deduct your hobbycrafts costs if it's just a hobby, despite being required to report the income; if you want to deduct the costs from the income, then you have to define it as a business. The same applies for those selling on Amazon: to deduct the costs of doing business from the income produced, you must file the very form that acknowledges it's a business. When working for others (such as a non-profit) as a volunteer, it becomes an "occupation" if you have identified responsibilities, a consistent role, or any of many other aspects that show that you function as regular employee (even if unpaid and part-time.) But when in doubt: Ask the other party. They might even give you permission to do something outside of the contract terms. 

Many companies in the US do not freeze hiring. 1. Well -of course- hiring varies by industry and arena: You don't really think that construction is busy hiring in December, or retail sales in March, do you? Take a look here for historical numbers by month: $URL$ The differences are easy to spot when you look at, say, Jan 2012 vs Sept 2012, even though the general patterns are similar. There's a nice analysis on monster: $URL$ 

For diversity, let me provide an answer that is not US centric, but Denmark centric (and possibly also applies to much of the EU.) It is customary, when you quit your job, to ask for a written recommendation from your nearest boss. And unless you were fired for not doing your job, your boss will most probably provide one. It is normally a single full page with: 

Formal: Dates of employment and your responsibilities. Professional: How is your personal approach to the tasks/challenges you were presented during your employment. How do you usually contribute to team effort, and how can your next employer best utilise your skills. Etc. Personal: A bit about your personal relation with your previous boss. How did you contribute to the atmosphere at the workplace, what is your general mood, etc. In DK it is common to have a friendship-like relationship with your boss, you are pretty much seen as equal but with different responsibilities. Your boss decides what you do, and you do what your boss decides (unless you have a better idea), but that does not mean you are not (almost) equals. Contact information, such that the next employer can call and validate the information and get more details. 

But that is only 7 hours of sleep a night. I know it is common in this modern cooperate world to only sleep 7 or 6 hours a night, but most people need around 8. I myself am around 8.5. And as others have stated, exercise, it really improves the quality of your sleep. 

So to answer your question directly (DK centric): References are not a thing of the past. Usually you will provide one full page per previous employment with very specific details on your performance in that position.
