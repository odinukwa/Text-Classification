It's been a few years since I read the book but clearly Manchester is talking about names from the perspective of the peasants who lived in them and not anyone else. They had little to no reason to refer to their village by anything other than "our village" anymore than they needed last names to identify individuals. Manchester didn't mean that the villages literally had never been named by anyone ever. He meant that the peasent prespective on the world was so small that they individually did not require or know names that identified individuals or their village to peoples distant from the village itself. We forget that: 1) culture and language were stratified by class in the medieval age, the nation state in which every social class in a polity was of the save ethnic group had not yet evolved. That meant that nobles spoke one language, the urban middle class another and the peasants yet another. Lack of direct communication made local variation of the same language very extreme. So, no doubt the local tax farmer from the city had a name for each little village, and perhaps the clerks for the nobles had another but that doesn't mean that the peasants in the village knew what either name was or spoke the language the name was in. People name things for labels. The same thing can in have as many names as there are reasons to label it. There is no such thing as true canonical name. 2) There were no quantitative spacial maps. Look at the Doomsday book. It's not a map, it's a list of properties and surviving population with vague spatial inferences of relative direction and distance. If all you had was the Doomsday book, you could not recreate a map of England nor likely navigate to any small place mentioned in the book with any reliability. All navigation, even at sea, was done by sequential landmarks. Miss one and you were lost. To navigate to a particular village you would have to know and follow precisely, a specific series landmarks making the correct turn at each one. 3) People who actually had knowledge of the wider world most likely wouldn't bother to go through the hassle of helping out a lost peasant. He would have to find someone of his own social class, from at least his general area, identify that individual as such, and then try and solicit help. So, you're a peasant that calls your hometown "our village" day-to-day. Maybe you've heard someone else call it something or the other in a language and dialect you don't understand. Then an army comes through, binds you, blind folds you, beats you and keeps you hungry and dehydrated while they march in what to you is a random direction. Lose track of your local landmarks for just one branch and your lost. When they let you go, which way do you run? Whom do you ask for help? The nobles who impressed you in the first place or their servants? Ask to see their copy of the local version of Doomsday book because...oh wait your illiterate. Doesn't matter anyway because they can't understand you and can't be bothered to try. You likely would have to find an actual chain of fellow peasants, one captured local who knew someone captured a little further away who knew another and so on until you could follow the chain back to someone who lived within spitting distance of your home. How likely was that? The village could have dozen names and be every public record and famous throughout the land for reasons unknown to the peasant but if the peasant can't map what he knows about the village with what distant outsiders know, he can't find his way home. 

Candles where a fairly major fire hazard as it was difficult to shield them yet still get air. The flames were not large, people used to snuff them with their fingers. Also, as Matt Riddly has pointed out, an hour of light in IIRC 1792 took three hours of labor during the day for the average person. Not until the later 1800s, was it common for the middle class and lower to keep lights after sundown. This was all before hard data collection so nobody really knows. I do know that it is agreed that the major source of burns, at least in the past northen climes over the last few centuries has come from women's dresses being ignited by kitchen fires. Lanterns, both whale oil and later kerosene were not not much of risk, even the glass ones. The active flames were contained and the vapor pressure of the oils was so low they were difficult to ignite and if the lamp broke, the fuel was almost certain to smoother the flame than ignite. The whole glass lamp being a Molotov cocktail is pure Hollywood. Town gas lighting in urban areas appeared circa 1810, much earlier than most people imagine. So not in populated areas, niether candles nor laterns would likely be in use. 

Firstly, the Code/Wind talkers were used almost exclusively in front line tactical units. This meant they communicated via very short range walkie-talkies or land lines. The walkie-talkies had short range e.g. <3 miles in optimal conditions. Given the mountains and jungles of the pacific war, the walkie-talkies could usually reach the company HQ and not much else. Front men at the front could reach their first level of command, maybe. The whole one guy with a walki-talkie calling out to battleship miles off the coast for air support is pure Hollywood. Land-lines, telephones, were far more common and reliable but easily tapped. In some versions, which the German made heavy use off, the return circuit was actually the ground itself, making tapping just a matter of getting withen a few yards/meters with a probe. In tactical situations, minutes count, so encryption devices or code books were so slow to be useless. Besides, code books and gadgets were easily captured as each side raided the other constantly expressly for prisoners and intelligence. The Japanese learned a lot of Navajo very quickly by the simply expedient of capturing Wind-talkers and torturing them or, as was more common, other prisoners. Stoic Navajo Marines could stand a lot of pain themselves but broke watching the Japanese set their fellow marines or local civilian children on fire. (The pacific island war was "War to the Knife" as the Japanese broke almost every conceivable law, rule or custom of civilized warfare and the allied forces of Americans, Aussies and Kiwi soon learned to give as good as the got (which the Geneva convention allows.) Which is why thidea that U.S, soldier cracked in Vietnam is so silly. Their father's had fought through much more worse for much longer... but I digress.) What made their verbal communications the most opaque was their use of metaphors and illusions rooted in the culture and environmental experiences of Navajo people themselves. The used the behavior of animals, weather, terrain, culture and religion, often hastily converted into an ever evolving code,e.g. one week using rabbits to mean speed but using them to mean slow the next. That made their dialog unintelligible not only to the enemy but even to captured Navajo tortured into attempting decrypt the intercepted dialog. The controlling factor though was the pace of tactical combat. Given weeks or months, any verbal code could be cracked but the Japanese only had hours or days at most to make use of the intelligence because it because useless as the tactical situation changed. They Code/Wind talkers were only the most famous of those who founds means for secure ad hoc communications. America had a vast "toolkit" of many subcultures many whose speech proved almost unintelligible to anyone one else. The Navy used back-hills Southerns, both white and black to communicate in their drawling, metaphor chocked dialect. In one case, two Italians appeared to sing drunkingly across a land line assumed to be trapped, and no one, not even other Italians could understand them. In my favorite trick, they had Japanese-Americans simply babble across compromised lines in slang ridden Japanese, causing the Imperial Japanese to waste a lot time trying to make sense out non-sense. 

No State of the Confederacy could ever choose forbid slavery. So, much for state's rights. This would mutate into the "Myth of the Lost Cause" shortly after the war. The other myth is that the North fought primarily for abolition. In fact, abolitions were in the main a small radical group of Northern European Protestant cultural supremacist. They were violently anti-Catholic and ferociously in favor of Manifest Destiny and forced relocation of the First American Peoples. Many people at the time, including Lincoln, pointed out that they seemed driven by hatred and envy of the southern class, than out of concern of those enslaved. Abolition seemed almost a side effect. They arguably triggered the war early and certainly made it more protracted by out and out lying about John Brown and his intentions to foster a mass slave revolt at Harper's Ferry, instead turning into a "Raid." This made it easy for the radical southerners to convince many that the north intended to destroy the south in a race war that would result in the deaths of millions. It triggered the arming of the South, without which the war would have at least been briefer. They were mistrust prior to the war and as the war advanced, they became actively hated, especially by the soldiery (there were notable exceptions Lawrence Chamberlain for example.) They constantly interfered with military operations being responsible for the loss of the First Battle of Bull Run/Manassas as well as disaster at Battle of Fredericksburg. Many working class Northern's feared economic competition from freed slaves and the vast majority of Northern whites including Lincoln were dubious that whites and blacks could live together as equals. In truth, what the North fought for was to preserve the Union of the States. One of the consequences of the Civil War was so seal the Union in blood that later generations forgot that the fear of disunion was a major and ongoing concern right up to the Civil War. The first attempt at secession was in Connecticut during war of 1812 and South Caroline threatened to do so in 1836. Without an inviolate Union, Democracy was impossible if everyone just stalked off when they didn't get their way. It's telling that the Gettysburg address, considered by most the greatest American political speech, does not mention slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation set off wide spread dissension in the Union ranks and increased desertions. But in hindsight, they were right to prioritize maintaining American Democracy even if as Lincoln once said it meant keeping slavery. American in 1860 was the last true Democracy left standing. The counter-reaction to the French Revolution had locked Europe into Aristocracy. Even England was facing a rollback of franchise in its plutocracy. Many in the North viewed the primary threat in the South before the war as a rising hereditary aristocracy instead of slavery. If the South had won, its possible that succession in America would have been the norm, the country would have flown apart North and South and popular Democracy would have died world wide for half a century or more. Certainly, many elites in Europe were routing for just that outcome. It was only a good 20-30 years later, that idea that North fought primarily for Abolition took hold. Most likely it did so because at a time of American's rise to the Greatest Nation status, the idea of the entire United States flying apart and popular Democracy dying by then seemed almost silly, so they needed another mythos. As to why the slaves did not rebel either before or during the war: The Southern whites were terrified of slave revolts as the majority of them in history simply became slaughters of the slave owners. The history of Haiti and the extermination of the white population there after Napoleon's treachery, haunted them in particular. The South was essentially a police state keeping slaves isolated and unable to coordinate. During the war, some slaves feared an overkill reaction if they rose up behind the lines. In the past, just the men had been executed after trials. This time they feared extermination. But such fears were very rare. As well, as part of Lincoln's attempt at reconciliation, Union Armies were under orders to prevent uprising. But perhaps more importantly, the Civil War had an odd sense of propriety running through it. (Although we shouldn't romanticize it.) But, for example, when Sherman marched through Georgia and South Carolina, the southern white males that remained would flee to the hills with their slaves and other chattel while leaving their women folk at home to deal with the Union Army. It's odd war in which one side feels confident enough in the other sides morality that the first side leaves their women unprotected against the other. That same sense of propriety lead slaves who wished to fight for their freedom to runaway to the Union lines and become uniformed soldiers, instead of murdering their masters or fighting as guerrillas (something still frowned on.) Telling, in the last two years of the war nearly entire counties lost their military age white male population which was defined very broadly. In many cases, farms and plantations were being run by a handful of white women and dozens and sometimes hundreds of slaves. Yet, virtually none of the women came to harm and in at least one case, a group of slaves lynched another that had tried to sexually assault his white mistress. Ironically, the same sense of propriety prevented the male slaves from revolting when their only targets were women and girls. In sum, 

1) The guilds had their roots in a particular institution of Northern Europe, the Free city. Northern Europe was largely unique in that in the beginning it's cities were not seats of political power nor even particularly military hard points. This contrasted sharply with the experience of southern Europe and most of the rest of the world in general. Instead, a group of traders and craftsmen would either build a settlement on some unwanted piece of ground e.g. the entirety of Holland, or they would petition the local nobel who militarily controlled the region for a spot of land. In the early and middle medieval periods trade and crafts, while necessary where only low single digit contributors, at best, to the overall economy, so the nobles didn't care. Neither did the nobles understand or care to understand business or trade. Instead, for a fixed fee in taxes, the inhabitants where granted "liberties" more akin to the modern concept of "privileges", and allowed to build a city and govern themselves. This independence was symbolized by the "Keys to the City" which the inhabitants could use to lock the noble out if they so choose. Giving someone the keys to the city was a ritual of deep trust and respect. An entire network of trading and crafts cities sprang up all governed internally by the founding inhabitants and their descendants and settling mutual disputes by the lex merchator, or "merchants law" probably histories only non-violence based legal system. Price-fixing seems to be a hardwired into human economic behavior because it shows up in all cultures and in all times. The idea that there is a "fair" price for every exchange that can be determined by reason long before an exchange takes place, crops up eternally. Inevitably, all those doing the same work in the same city, which were small towns by our standards, would collude to set a "fair" price and exclude any competition. These price fixing systems on the part of craftsmen evolved into the Guilds. Within a few generations, such price fixing became seen as a positive right of those in the Guilds and those who undercut the fixed price tantamount to thieves. They weren't all bad. They provide training, trademark protection, social welfare support, legal protection and political representation for their members. Although, their customers paid for those guild beneifts by the fixed price premium on work only the guild could provide. Guilds, merchant cartels and commercial organization in the medieval era in general is very interesting because the nobility jealously garded their own monopoly on legal violence, so the guilds and other similar organizations in the beginning enforced their dictates largely non-violently by shunning and boycotts (although in a time when even the upper middle class spent most of their income on food, such non-violent acts could be lethal if they went on long enough.) It wasn't until the end of the lex mechator when the nobles noticed how much money was rolling around and decided cut themselves in on the action, do you see guild price-fixing enforced by judicial or ad hoc violence. Commercial law and criminal/political law, once entirely separate, the first private the latter of the state, got folded into a single, violence enforced system. At that point, challenging the guild meant challenging the State. That's when things really got ugly for century or so circa 1450-1600 2) Guild rank was complex affair and depended on the craft. As with all things pre-corporation, lineage played a large role. If you dad was high up in the Guild, you probably would be as well. Politics played a role as well and as noted by Sammuel Russel, you often effectively had to have a minimum level of capitalization to set up a formal shop in many cities. But compared to the rest of society of the time, Guilds were powerfully merit driven especially in highly technical, high stakes fields like shipwrighting, masonry or international trade. Lineage, capitalization and political skill could only get you so far if your boats sank, your buildings collapsed or you couldn't close the deal hundreds of miles away form all your political pull. Further, the power of guilds was sharply limited by the boundaries of their "liberties" usually the extent of the city walls. By the 14th century it became common for those who couldn't get or stay in a city guild to just take the risk to set up shop just right outside the walls. The cities were "burbs" so the ad hoc settlements became "sub-burbs" (Yep, "urban sprawl" is over 600 years old and is still driven by the same basic political and economic dynamic.) This limit on the guilds authorities meant that the driven and talented could escape guild control and rise on merit. It was not uncommon for a poor but talented orphans to rise on merit in many fields. Since success and money heal all wounds yesterday's scofflaw guild buster could be tomorrow's Master. Further driving merit, those already high up in the field always needed skilled fresh talent coming in at the bottom because that talent was eventually their own wealth. Especially in the highly physical trades like blacksmithing, Master craftsmen desperately needed skilled underlings because under the harsh use of their trade, their bodies simply broke down. Most men of that era where broken with repetitive motion injuries by 50 (a problem faced by third world craftsmen still.) In the finer trades like gold smithing, inevitable far-sightedness around the same time could in a career. (In the Wealth and Poverty of Nations, David S. Landes argued that spectacles gave Europe and overall economic boost by extending the working lives of key craftsmen by up to 20 years.) The goal of every craftsmen was acquire skills, then apprentices, then journeymen and build up capital and a sustainable shop so that in the last 10-15 years of his life, he could put down his tools when his body gave and largely train and manage until he died. It was all well and good to prefer family over strangers, those of the right ethnic group, region, religion etc but if you needed someone skills to keep a roof over your, those concerns faded into the background. That allowed a relative weakening of the barriers to merit advancement within and certainly without the guilds. It's kinda of easy to see why those within guilds so jealously guarded their price fixing privileges. With the threat of age or accident always looming as threat to the entire family, the thought of giving up fixed prices and their largely guaranteed income must have been terrifying. Conversely, one can see how those outside the guilds, bitterly resented the privilege and the poverty it often forced on outsiders despite their merit.
