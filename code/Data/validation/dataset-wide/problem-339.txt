And here's a size comparison between a magmatter nanotube (the tiny blue line on the lower left) and a classical carbon nanotube. 

Simply put, this creature is engineered to be an interstellar steed, with enough reason to use insane amounts of power to sustain equally insane metabolic pathways. 

Organized Synesthesia is the biological version of multimedia arts. Within the brain, synesthesia occurs as an interpretation of sensory data from a sense organ that is somehow associated with a type of sensory data from a different sense organ. The idea of hearing smells and tasting emotions probably leads to disorganized thoughts, but enhances the synesthete's pattern recognition abilities. But by making the recognizable patterns available for correlation to consequently develop entirely new "meta-senses" arising from those correlations, maybe we can re-organize thoughts even better. The simplest example I could give would be a sensory ability made for sentient photosynthetic organisms, designed to find the optimal light settings to have enjoyable meals with maximum nutritional value. Simply put, a creature can taste the rainbow and the sunlight by having: 

Radiation. Look at the contaminated zone around the remains of the Chernobyl power station. It's teaming with wildlife which appears largely unaffected, but humans either don't live there or must be very careful where they go and how long they spend in contaminated areas. So why is this? Are the animals immune to radiation? No, not particularly, although natural selection will push them towards higher radiation tolerance, not enough time has passed yet for an effect to be apparent. The animals die of cancer and radiation sickness just as much as humans would, the difference is that the health of an individual animal isn't so important as long as the breeding population survives. The cause doesn't have to be radiation, anything which increases the chances of an early death but doesn't generally kill you outright will keep intelligent species away without making much difference to animals. 

Most of the Royal Navy gets destroyed by a massive storm. This famously happened to not one but two Mongol invasion fleets sent to invade Japan. The Romans also managed to lose their fleets to storms several times. It was less likely to happen to the Royal Navy due to the fact that they had radios and weather forecasts, but they didn't have satellites or computers so it is still plausible that they could be blindsided by a storm. A storm could also hit the UK itself and destroy planes and infrastructure, gifting an easy victory to Hitler, should he be ready to seize the opportunity. Of course Hitler would still need a lot of ships, but he might be able to scrounge together civilian vessels and Japanese/Italian vessels to make it happen. 

For the locomotor skills you required, I'd say the human body plan is enough, albeit with slightly longer arms and three-jointed legs for quadrupedal motion, a prehensile tail for high-speed maneuvers, an opposable toe for each foot, and a highly flexible membrane connecting the forearms, hips, and forelegs for gliding and rolling. The creature would like a cross between a monkey, a flying squirrel, and a cat. Momo from Avatar:TLA would be the closest creature, minus the oversized ears. 

Others have contributed good thoughts about the efficiency benefits of a small number of large reactors. Those points are valid and I think you should take heed of them. I'd just like to contribute a point which heads the other way, as much as anything because I think it might make for some interesting plot devices for your story. I have no direct knowledge of fusion reactors, but I did work for a while with the largest (by physical dimensions, not power output) nuclear Fission reactors ever made. An interesting property of physically large reactors is that controlling the reaction becomes harder compared to smaller units. Neutron propagation time across the core becomes significant, so they don't respond to control inputs as quickly as small reactors do. Now I'm not even sure if this transfers to fusion reactors as they are quite different beasts, but if we suppose for a moment that it does, it seems to me that the following might be true 

Organized synesthesia could be achieved by conscious correlations of sensory data, enhancing both pattern recognition and interpretation 

Empathic Telepathy Everybody knows telepathy is simply a remote transmission and reception of thoughts. Adding empathy to the mix however, allows the broadcast of emotions, feelings, sensations, experiences, among similar abstract concepts, that all seem to be very differently interpreted by each individual as based from their own experiences and memories. 

Apart from that, magmatter can also collapse into a blackhole if magatoms are oriented too close together, making strings, sheets, and hollow objects of magmatter the most practical structures. 

your big reactors take time to change power level, so you have a delay before your ship can, say, fully charge it's weapons or employ full acceleration, or jump to light speed if your universe includes ftl travel Maybe you need a mix of large and small units to mitigate 1 Large units might be more susceptible to control system damage or breakdown making them unstable and either causing a catastrophic explosion or requiring a shutdown for repairs. 

Source Based on the image, I can deduce that strong lasers are concentrated into the target chamber, generating enough power to "rip spacetime". This results to the energy being dissipated as a stream of radiation and virtual particles transferring their momenta into the ship. That stream is magnetically directed towards the back part of the ship to create thrust. 

With these in mind, together with the assumption that the magnetic charge of a monopole is directly propotional to its mass, then theoretically, magnetic equivalents of nucleons and electrons (called magnuclei and magtrons respectively) can stably exist as magatoms. Magatoms, having large charges, will typically have larger masses and also greater internal attraction-repulsion forces, therefore making them extremely dense, but also extremely strong materials. A magatom may be imagined as a big north pole orbited by small south poles. 

There are reserved IP addresses For example, 127.0.0.1 routes back to your own computer, while 192.168.XXX.XXX addresses are reserved for internal use in private networks, as are the 10.XXX.XXX.XXX and 172.16.XXX.XXX blocks. You can safely use them as fictional addresses knowing that no-one on the internet has these addresses. There are also some IP blocks reserved for documentation, namely 192.0.2.XXX, 198.51.100.XXX and 203.0.133.XXX. IPv6 has the block 2001.bd8.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX reserved for documentation, while fcXX.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX is for use in private networks. Unfortunately they're not quite as punchy as domain names, although you can actually connect to IP addresses through your browser. $URL$ $URL$ 

The four topics I discussed are more tightly related than I may have discussed them, but the simple premise is that language, thought, and perception will merge into a single concept. If the answer is yes and a convention for mixed sensations will indeed provide people with the privilege to broadcast the entirety of themselves, what would become of such a society? But if no, and allowing ourselves to consciously develop mixed sensations and be able to communicate them more efficiently still cannot allow us to completely and truly understand one another, then what can? 

lots of good answers already, but there's one no one seems to have mentioned which, coming from the UK, was the first one I thought of. Say you overcome all the problems everyone has mentioned and build your mega-dome surrounding your city. It's great, your city is now completely immune to all natural disasters and adverse weather from a light dusting of snow to a mega-tsunami. As a result, everyone wants to live in your city. Your population increases, you look to build more houses, flats, etc and......oh. Your dome is full, your city can't expand without doing the whole mega-project over again. For examples of something like this which has happened, look at every European city dating back to medieval times. They all had walls once, to defend against barbarian hoards. Look where the walls are now, they certainly aren't outside the city anymore. Come to think of it, since this is WB, that might make a good basis for a story in your world. What happens when the city expands/wants to expand too far?
