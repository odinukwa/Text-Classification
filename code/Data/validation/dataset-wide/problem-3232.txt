I assume Delille here is Jacques Delille, who lived about this time and was at one time an abbot. Anyone able to dig up reference to this egg-eating encounter and scandal? 

This passage does not include some elements of the proces mentioned by Madden, such as the interesting presentation and voting on the nominations for doge by the final 41, the automatic exclusion of relations from remaining draws once someone is chosen by the lot, or the use of small wax balls with parchment inside for the lot drawing process. There is also more detail in a paper cited in the Wikipedia posting found here: Electing the Doge of Venice: analysis of a 13th Century protocol (PDF) My question is whether the Venetian system inspired similar systems in other states or political bodies (let us say, before the 19th century) or were there other similar multi-stage selection processes for positions in other contemporary or early cases? Here by cases, let us be flexible, as there are not a lot of republics etc. around. It might include voting process for council positions, guild leadership, etc. I especially welcome well-sourced answers. 

All of these transcriptions of the speeches at the congresses are in German, but the 1897 congress, alone among all them, contains the protocol in both Hebrew and German: 

In (1) this is discussed primarily on p90-91. The overall emphasis seems to be that during this early period, was that the Bolsheviks did not put much active emphasis on the issue. It notes that Anarchists and Cadets "officially proposed" revoking legislation against homosexuals while the Bolsheviks took no position. However, its absence from the Russian Criminal Code in 1922 and 1926 effectively decriminalized it, as you pointed out. In terms of practice (1) merely mentions that a group of homosexuals that referred to themselves as the "blues" included (according to one source) prominent figures such as Foreign Affairs Commissar Georgi Chicherin (also mentioned in the short article in @Emanuele's answer and probably the source of the official in government you quoted), poets like Mikhail Kuzmin, Nikolai Klyuev, Sofie Parnak, and director Sergei Eisenstein. While not illegal, towards the key early 1930s turning point it was increasingly pathologized, rather than seen as a crime. In (2), Carleton points to the surprising defense of freedom in sexuality in a 1927 work called Sexual Crimes arguing that it did not violate anyone's rights (p60). Later, however, it emphasizes the diversity of opinions in the writings of early Soviets with some seeing as "outside the proletarian norm" (p78) or "were no longer authentic members of the proletariat" (p142) while others, such as Israel Gelman, who studied the sexual behavior of postrevolutionary youth, called it as a "sickness" and "perverse" but not to be condemned or persecuted. (3) by Healey, is perhaps the most cited book discussing this issue during the period you are interested it. As also true with (1) I had limited access to it through Google Books. Chapter 4 and 5 are of interest to your question. Healy argues as others have, that "the silence in the penal code...offered new opportunities for medicine in an area formerly dominated by police approaches" (p148) There is a lot more here but I am not able to get access to it. A review of the book in The Journal of Sex Research Vol. 39, No. 3, Aug., 2002 by Stephen O. Murray (limited access: $URL$ p247 which argues that Healey goes beyond what his sources can show him. He questions Healey's effort to locate "clear intention" to remove sodomy from the criminal code or an "explicit decision". Murray points out that 1922-1933 there was "no single official position on homosexuality" in the "Slavic heartlands" but "treated with suspicion as being 'unproletarian'...decadent bourgeois behavior," and he also quotes German sex-reformer Magnus Hirschfeld visiting in 1926 as not seeing "any open organized group of homosexuals in the new Russia and that Soviet journalism and literature were silent about the question" - which he contrasts with liberal late Czarist Russia. These three works give some hints, but I didn't find much mention about the lived experiences and practical impact of the [lack of] policy on homosexuals on the ground. Some of this may be covered in Healey sections I was not able to view. Beyond laws, of course, the discriminations faced on a daily level or the need felt by individuals to conceal their sexuality is another matter that may be difficult to find through available primary sources. There may be extensive literature in Russian on this, and hopefully someone can contribute with more on this. 

This is an excellent question and this answer is only the "easy" answer based on easily available sources, and should be used primarily as a jumping off point for more research on what is in fact more likely a more complicated reality. The full PDFs of the stenographic protocols of the Zionist congresses from 1897-1935 are available here: 

You might want to have a look over this short summary on About.com about this as well: About.com: The Effects of the American Revolutionary War on Britain Note: The short-term calculations of economic benefit would be a trickier thing to work out, especially because fundamental transformations are in the works that are not directly tied to the course of events in the US and would be difficult to filter out. This comes through in the opening chapter "England 1783–1846: a preview" in A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People?: England, 1783-1846 which lays out the foundations for the "Great Transformation" that is about to take place. At any rate, the historians in various sources I scanned over not cited here all focus on the broader long-term picture of renewed trade with the US and a shift in empire, which I think is appropriate when looking at the impact of a world-historical event like this.

Many works, including the wikipedia entry note that there was food offered from the east but, "they do so chiefly to emphasize that the great majority of Western sector residents turned it down.” [1:571] Speaking to your suggestion that the Soviets could have just continued indefinitely, Stivers suggests even more strongly: 

I'm actually deeply suspicious about the data used used on TimeAndDate for historical times, and I suspect things were a lot more messy on the ground in China in late 19th to mid-20th century, even with growth of telegraph etc. I did, however, poke around some postings in Chinese about Jon Skeet's Stack Overflow posting. One of the commenters here, wubotao, pointed to this passage on the Chinese wikipedia entry for the Chinese Time Zone (中國時區) 

This kind of "is X rare" is clearly difficult, since it is usually hard to quantify things like this across space and time. @Histophile's own memories from the period and the fact that Göring's habit was singled out in a contemporary American account are suggestive that at least in US of time, this might have stood out. It doesn't tell us much about elites elsewhere, for example. The following is left not as an answer so much as notes for anyone who wants to take this up. Now nail polish for women has become so associated with a marker of sexuality, transvestitism, or Goth culture, but I posed the question to see if anyone knew if it may not have necessarily invoked this connection in the not so distant past. The very few number of references in books 1900-1950 on google books in variations of "he/his" "nail polish" "lacquered nails" "nail enamel" etc. suggest, as @Histophile argues, that it wasn't too common or remarked upon in English language at least. Just two examples of only a dozen or two that describe a man with colored nails:
