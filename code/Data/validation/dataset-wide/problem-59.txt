I think some of your charges are a bit off for what you're trying to do. The idea (as I understand it) is that the stuff on the electric planet is attracted to the planet itself in the same way normal stuff is attracted to a normal planet. Effects on Alice The effects on Alice will depend on a few things. First, how is the charge distributed through her? Is every molecule in her body somehow slightly charged? If so, that's probably going to have a lot of biological effects I'm not qualified to answer. If not, the force won't be distributed perfectly across her body, so it could cause the force to be perceived differently than gravity would. The big thing here is her inner ear. If the fluid that helps us sense acceleration has enough charge difference that it behaves properly, it would probably keep her normal sense of balance intact. But you'd also need to account for different ways we move muscles. If all the charge is in her head, her neck muscles will get a lot stronger, while her arm muscles will be barely used. So the charge would ideally be distributed fairly evenly through her body. Still, you could probably get away with, say, a thousand pockets of charge implanted inside insulators (so the charge doesn't all flow into her body), with the pockets attached to various parts of her skeleton. Obviously, there are some medical issues at play, but I don't think it's wholly implausible. Setting up an Electric Planet Warning: Lots of Math! I probably screwed something up, so don't take it as gospel truth. Coulomb's law of electrostatic interaction works the same as Newton's law of universal gravitation. Subscript p is for planet, s is for stuff on the planet, g is for gravity, e is for electric. $F_g={Gm_pm_s\over r^2}$ vs $F_e={kq_pq_s\over r^2}$ Now, one major difference is when we apply it to acceleration. For both cases, $F=MA$$\leftrightarrow A={F\over M}$ For gravity, the inertial mass is identical to the gravity-causing mass, so we can reduce the equation, $A_g={{Gm_pm_s\over r^2}\over m_s}$$={Gm_p\over r^2}$ However, for electric charges, inertial mass has nothing to do with electric charge, so no such reduction is inherently possible, $A_e={{kq_pq_s\over r^2}\over m_s}$$={kq_pq_s\over m_sr^2}$ This is a good thing though, or it would be impossible to have lots of charge without lots of gravity. For the next part, we want the electric force to be the same as the gravitational force on Earth. To make it feel right, this means we need to assign a value of electric charge that's relatively proportional to its mass (so small things have small charge, big things have big charge). So, $F_g=F_e$ ${Gm_pm_s\over r^2}={kq_pq_s\over r^2}$ $Gm_pm_s=kq_pq_s$ From here, we can pick some target mass, say 100 kg, then plug it in. We can look up the following constants and values: $G$$=6.674\cdot 10^{−11} {N\cdot m^2\over kg^2}$ $k$$=8.987552\cdot 10^9 {N\cdot m^2\over C^2}$ $m_p=$$m_{earth}$$=5.9721986\cdot 10^{24} kg$ $m_s=m_{target}=100 kg$ We can plug them into the equality above to get, $6.674\cdot 10^{−11} {N\cdot m^2\over kg^2}\cdot 5.9721986\cdot 10^{24} kg\cdot 100 kg$$=8.987552\cdot 10^9 {N\cdot m^2\over C^2}\cdot q_pq_s$ $3.986\cdot 10^{16} N\cdot m^2$$=8.987552\cdot 10^9 {N\cdot m^2\over C^2}\cdot q_pq_s$ ${3.986\cdot 10^{16}\over 8.987552\cdot 10^9}C^2=q_pq_s$ $q_pq_s=4.435\cdot 10^6 C^2$ At this point, we can see that there are infinitely many solutions. Our planet can have very little charge while the stuff on it has a lot of charge, but this will cause the stuff to repel each other very much. Or the planet can have a lot of charge while the stuff on it has very little. The second idea seems better to me. The most natural way in my mind is to make the proportions of charges the same as the proportions of mass. So, $m_p\over m_s$$={q_p\over q_s}$. For our 100 kg test case, this means we have: $5.9721986\cdot 10^{24} kg \over 100 kg$$={q_p\over q_s}$$=5.9721986\cdot 10^{22}$ We can manipulate an earlier answer to get, $q_pq_s=4.435\cdot 10^6 C^2$ ${q_pq_s\over q_s^2}$$={4.435\cdot 10^6 C^2\over q_s^2}$ ${q_p\over q_s}$$={4.435\cdot 10^6 C^2\over q_s^2}$$=5.9721986\cdot 10^{22}$ $q_s^2$$={4.435\cdot 10^6 C^2\over 5.9721986\cdot 10^{22}}$ $q_s^2=7.426\cdot 10^{-17} C^2$ $q_s=8.617\cdot 10^{-9} C$ $q_p\cdot 8.617\cdot 10^{-9} C=4.435\cdot 10^6 C^2$ $q_p={4.435\cdot 10^6 C^2\over 8.617\cdot 10^{-9} C}$ $q_p=5.1468\cdot 10^{14} C$ To set this up, we need a relatively massive object (so Alice can't noticeably move the planet every time she jumps) that is light enough to have negligible gravity still. Something like 1 megaton$=10^9 kg$ ought to do. The planet will barely accelerate when she moves since it's 10 million times her mass, and only exerts about $0.07 N$ of force which equates to about $0.0006 {m\over s^2}$ of acceleration even if the center of mass is just 10 meters under her feet. Note that this makes the planet much more dense than Earth, $238732 {kg\over m^3}$ vs. $5495 {kg\over m^3}$, and making it less dense will just decrease the gravitational effect even further. Next, we need a highly-charged something sitting about 6400 km from Alice. Charge per proton/electron is $\pm 1.6021766\cdot 10^{-19} C$, and our total charge was $5.1468\cdot 10^{14} C$. This gives us, ${5.1468\cdot 10^{14} C \over 1.6021766\cdot 10^{-19} {C\over e^-}}$$=3.212\cdot 10^{33} e^-$ Obviously, we can't just have $10^{33}$ electrons hanging out somewhere, or they'll blow apart. What we really need is $10^{33}$ extra electrons in a relatively balanced system. For example, we could have $10^{38}$ protons and $10^{38}+10^{33}$ electrons. From Alice's perspective, there's no difference (well, except the part where she might actually survive), but there's a huge difference from the charged object's perspective. One proton mass $=1.6726\cdot 10^{-27} kg$, so $10^{38}$ protons has a mass of $1.6726\cdot 10^{11} kg$. The total electron mass is only about $10^8 kg$, which is pretty negligible in comparison. Because all this mass is 6400 km from Alice, it will have negligible gravitational influence on her. Of note, we could also do this by having a much lower charge that's much closer to Alice, but the closer we get the charge to Alice, the more important tidal effects will be. If we put the charge 10 meters under her feet, her head would feel noticeably less pull than her feet (probably -- I didn't actually do the math). So let's solve all the above for a distance of 10 km. This lets us put Alice on a small asteroid 10 km in radius, then tunnel down to make the charge at the core. It's a lot more feasible than the construction I made at first. We'll leave the charges for the stuff the same, which gives us, ${Gm_pm_s\over r_{Earth}^2}$$={kq_pq_s\over r_{10 km}^2}$ $q_p=Gm_pm_sq_s{r_{10 km}^2\over r_{Earth}^2}$ Noting that our previous value of $q_p$$=Gm_pm_sq_s$, we can just multiply by the ratio of squared distances, $q_{p2}=q_{p1}{r_{10 km}^2\over r_{Earth}^2}$ $q_{p2}=5.1468\cdot 10^{14} C\cdot {(10 km)^2\over (6367 km)^2}$ $q_{p2}=1.2696\cdot 10^9 C$ This equates to $7.9\cdot 10^{27}$ electrons. Using the same $10^5:1$ ratio as before, the protons would mass about $13.3 kg$. Again, 13 kg at 10 km is going to have a negligible gravitational effect on Alice. Note: My gut tells me that if 13 kg of charged particles can accelerate Alice at 1g from 10 km away, I screwed the math up somewhere, or this system isn't physically stable (like, the amount of charge inside Alice would boil her while it escaped into space or something). Still, the concept is valid, and I think it's plausible something like this could be done, especially for non-biological Alice-s. It seems plausible that a few hundred tons of charged stuff in the core should be physically capable of reasonably Earth-like acceleration from 10 km away. 

How far would Mars need to be to orbit the Earth without destroying each other under their own gravities? The Roche limit says Mars and Earth need to be about 2.5 Earth radii from each other before they tear each other apart. That said, tidal forces can still cause a lot of damage from earthquakes, etc. Realistically, tidal locking of Earth would be much stronger because Mars has a higher tidal force than our current moon. If Earth is almost tidally locked with Mars, there'd be very little tidal effect on the Earth. I'm not sure whether extra tidal forces or extra tidal locking would be a greater effect after 4-ish billion years. Speaking of Roche limits, you put Jupiter very close to the stars. $1\over 3$ AU is about 49 million km. The Roche limit for Jupiter orbiting our Sun is about 1.7 million km, which means it would be safe. However, your two stars will orbit at some finite distance from each other, which could put your Jupiter inside the effective Roche limit for your system. I'm not sure how that math works. How far would Earth need to be to make sure that the two stars pose no difference to radiation or temperature changes? This is greatly dependent on the stars in question. You could hypothetically have two well-behaved stars, each with half the power output of our Sun, and if Earth were orbiting them at 1 AU, the power would be the same. If the binary stars have a lower power output, Earth needs to be closer to compensate. Likewise, Earth needs to be farther to compensate for a higher power output. Total power is a function of the power per unit area (intensity) times the total area. $P=I\cdot A$ For a star, the total area is a function of its radius. $A_{sphere}=4\pi r^2$ $P_{sun}=I_{sun}\cdot A_{sun}=I_{sun}\cdot 4\pi r_{sun}^2$ If all that power is radiating in all directions equally, the intensity at a given orbital distance is the power divided by the area of a sphere, centered on the star, whose radius is the planet's orbit. $I_{orbit}$ $={P_{sun}\over A_{orbit}}$ $={P_{sun}\over 4\pi r_{orbit}^2}$ We can solve for the orbital distance. $I_{orbit}$ $={P_{sun}\over 4\pi r_{orbit}^2}$ $r_{orbit}^2={P_{sun}\over 4\pi I_{orbit}}$ $r_{orbit}=\sqrt{P_{sun}\over 4\pi I_{orbit}}$ $r_{orbit}=\sqrt{P_{sun}}\sqrt{1\over 4\pi I_{orbit}}$ Let $C=\sqrt{1\over 4\pi I_{orbit}}$ $r_{orbit}=C\sqrt{P_{sun}}$ Now, you probably don't want to calculate power directly. Instead, you'll likely want the relative power of the new stars to our Sun. Let $P_{stars}=kP_{sun}$, where $k$ is the relative power factor. If $k=2$, the stars have twice the power output at any given distance. Then we can calculate the new orbital distance. $r_{orbit2}=C\sqrt{P_{stars}}$ $r_{orbit2}=C\sqrt{kP_{sun}}$ $r_{orbit2}=C\sqrt{k}\sqrt{P_{sun}}$ $r_{orbit2}=\sqrt{k}C\sqrt{P_{sun}}$ $r_{orbit2}=\sqrt{k}\cdot r_{orbit}=1AU\sqrt{k}$ How would Earth's orbit be affected, if likely? If you have to change the orbital distance, it will affect the orbital period, T. Likewise, if the total mass of the binary stars is different from the mass of our Sun, the period will change for a given distance. Note that $r$ needs to be replaced with $a$, the semi-major axis, if you're using elliptical orbits. $T_{Earth}=1yr=2\pi\sqrt{r_{orbit}^3\over GM_{sun}}$ $T_{Earth2}=2\pi\sqrt{r_{orbit2}^3\over GM_{stars}}$ If we let $M_{stars}=KM_{sun}$, so $K$ is the relative mass factor, then we get $T_{Earth2}=2\pi\sqrt{(\sqrt{k}\cdot r_{orbit})^3\over G(KM_{sun})}$ $T_{Earth2}=2\pi\sqrt{{r_{orbit}^3\over GM_{sun}}{\sqrt{k}^3\over K}}$ $T_{Earth2}=2\pi\sqrt{{r_{orbit}^3\over GM_{sun}}}\sqrt{{\sqrt{k}^3\over K}}$ $T_{Earth2}=1yr{\sqrt[4]{k^3}\over\sqrt{K}}$ $=1yr\cdot k^¾K^{-½}$ $=1yr\cdot k^{0.75}K^{-0.5}$ Ultimately, what would the sky, day and night, look like with a binary star, a hot Jupiter and Mars orbiting our planet? That depends on a lot of the above. We moved the planet so the total radiation is the same, so the brightness in the day will be comparable. The color will change if the temperature of the stars changed. You can look this up in blackbody radiation texts, but it's a bit complicated. Jupiter would get a lot brighter. Currently, it has a maximum brightness of magnitude −2.94. Its orbital distance goes from 5.2 AU to 0.33 AU, and incident light is inversely proportional to distance squared. So it gets $({5.2\over {1\over 3}})^2$ $=15.6^2$ $=243.36$ times brighter at any given distance. Additionally, it goes from 4.2 AU away from Earth to 0.67 AU away (minimum distances, maximum brightness), which makes it another $(4.2\cdot{3\over 2})^2$ $=39.69$ brighter. This is multiplicative with the surface intensity above, so total difference is $243.36\cdot 39.69$ $=9659$ times brighter. A difference of 1 magnitude is a 2.512 times change in brightness, so we can can solve for the difference. $M_{diff}=-\log_{2.512}{9659}=-9.96$ $M_{new}=M_{old}+M_{diff}$ $=-2.94-9.96=-12.9$. At it's brightest, it will be about $2.512^{12.9-12.74}=1.16$ times brighter than our Moon (magnitude -12.74). Mostly though, it won't be that bright, since we'll only see it partially illuminated, and when it is fully illuminated it will be almost directly behind the stars and barely visible (the sun is magnitude -26.74, which is $2.512^{26.74-12.9}=343,773$ times brighter than new Jupiter). Also, all of those apparent magnitudes will change if the stars are brighter than our Sun, or if the new Earth's orbital distance changes, but it should give you a ballpark figure. Lastly, the new Mars moon will be a prominent figure in the night sky. Mars' albedo is 0.250, while our Moon's albedo is 0.11. So a square km of Mars is 2.273 times brighter than a square km of the Moon with equal illumination. Additionally, Mars' radius is 3390 km, compared to the Moon's 1737 km. Visible surface area goes up with the square of radius, so Mars has $({3390\over 1737})^2=3.81$ times more visible area, making it $3.81\cdot 2.273=8.66$ times brighter at a given orbital distance. Brightness is proportional to $1\over r^2$, so Mars' apparent brightness will be $8.66{r_{Moon}^2\over r_{Mars}^2}$ if you change the orbital distance. If you let $r_{Mars}=R\cdot r_{Moon}$, so R is the orbital radius factor, the apparent brightness will be $8.66\over R^2$ times brighter. The orbital period of the Mars moon will also change. Using the same equations above, we get $T_{Mars}=1mth\cdot R^{0.75}\mu^{-0.5}$ Except now, k is replaced by R, and K is replaced by $\mu$ which is a bit complex: $\mu={M_{Earth}+M_{Mars}\over M_{Earth}+M_{Moon}}$ Fortunately, these masses are constant, so we get $\mu$ $=1.094$ $T_{Mars}={1mth\over\sqrt{1.094}}\cdot R^{0.75}$ $={27.322 days\over 1.04594}\cdot R^{0.75}=$ $26.12 days$$\cdot R^{0.75}$ 

It's hard to say, but my gut feeling is that, for any given population, one of the sexes would end up being less preferred by the other two sexes, and would therefore eventually go extinct. This would take quite a bit of time, but I think it would eventually happen. Note that a different sex might go extinct in a different population group, and there's no particular way to determine in advance which sexes would dominate in any particular group. The only way to keep a sex from going extinct is if all three sexes are required to reproduce. For example, maybe A and B need to mate to produce one half of an embryo, then B and C mate to finalize the embryo. In this case, either selection will find a way to bypass one of the sexes (who will then go extinct), or all three sexes will remain part of a stable population. As for the proportions, I don't know. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me that there are so many males. One male can easily keep dozens of females pregnant, but somehow nature decided a 50:50 ratio was better. The answer seems to be that males have a selection bias**, so couples with more male children produce more grandchildren, so despite the lack of "need", more males are produced anyways. Obviously the answer is somewhat complex, but if that rationale holds for three sexes, the ratio would likely be even as long as all three sexes are required. *My best guess, which Google says is some other people's best guess, is that either: having homosexuals around helps the rest of the population's sexual fitness somehow and therefore populations with gay genes thrive better than populations without, or: something that makes people more sexually fit happens to occasionally make gay people, and the added fitness to other people outweighs the reduced fitness of gay people. Or some combination of both. Source -- warning, scantily-clad men, possibly NSFW. **Source -- warning, naked baby covered in ick, possibly weird and/or NSFW.) 

There is a bit of confusion about my answer. I'm updating the answer with clarifications and additional information. The quotes are my original answer. TL;DR 

A commenter suggests 10 mi² is a circle of radius 2 miles. However, it doesn't really work that way. First, the wildlife isn't going to happen to congregate in a perfectly-symmetrical circle around the stargate so you can slaughter them. They're more likely to be concentrated near lakes, rivers, and valleys in a more linear arrangement. Second, the nearest concentration of wildlife might be many miles from the stargate. Third, animals tend to migrate with the seasons, and random events, and the fact that you're murdering them, so you'll have to keep up, which could lead you hundreds of miles away. The same comment also suggests you could always run 2 miles in 30 minutes. There's no guarantee the gate will be open 5 minutes, let alone 30, so you don't want to rely on that. But there's also no guarantee you happen to be in an area with relatively flat ground between you and the gate. If there are a few cliffs in the way, it could take hours to go 2 miles. And there's always the possibility of a major strain or break. Also, there's the issue of season. It might be great near the stargate when you arrive, but the middle of the worst winter ever when the gate reopens. You'd really want some kind of greenhouse going near the stargate for this, although it could be nearly impossible to pull off. 

The only way to realistically blanket the moon with air would be to cover the entire thing with some kind of biodome, unless you invent artificial gravity and/or manually increase the mass of the moon (which has substantial effects on Earth). You don't need a magnetic field, since it would take a very long time for the solar wind to strip the moon again (although it might make it a safer place to live). But without more gravity, the air on the surface will just evaporate into space. Further, even if you dumped a ridiculous amount of air on the planet, the lack of gravity means it won't be dense enough to breathe, even before it evaporates away. Then you have to deal with temperature. That's relatively easy. You need to get enough $CO_2$ or something to store the heat from the light side of the moon while you're in lunar day. Except the lunar day is around 28 Earth days, leaving extreme temperature differentials. So you'd have to either build giant fans to constantly circulate the air and keep convection going, or make the moon start spinning a lot faster. Now, before you start all that, typhoons couldn't start, because those are caused by different linear speeds at different latitudes, and the moon doesn't have nearly the differentials Earth has. But if you have enough airspeed to keep convection going, the winds would be hundreds to thousands of miles an hour, making anything on Earth look like a dust devil. So the only option would be to spin the moon itself faster. According to this page, the moon's $C\over MR^2$ is 3.929. We can multiply by its mass and radius squared to get $C=3.929\cdot 10^{24} kg\cdot (1738.1 km\cdot {1000 m\over 1 km})^2$$=1.2*10^{16} kg\cdot m^2$. Multiply by it's angular velocity squared, $\omega^2=({2\pi\over 27.3217}{rad\over day}{1 day\over 86400 s})^2$$=(2.662\cdot10^{-6}{rad\over s})^2$, and you get a rotational kinetic energy of $KE=8.41\cdot10^{25}J$. Do the same math for the new angular velocity and the energy is $KE=6.277×10^{28}J$. That's a difference of $\Delta KE=6.269\cdot 10^{28}J$. The sun's energy output is around $6.3\cdot 10^7{W\over m^2}$. Multiply by it's surface area, you get $3.797\cdot10^{26}W$$=3.797\cdot10^{26}{J\over s}$. If you could build a Dyson sphere, you could accelerate the moon in about 2 minutes. On the other hand, let's say we can "only" cover the entire surface of the moon in solar panels, and say they're 50% efficient at converting radiant energy into rotational kinetic energy. Now we have a total of $6.40 \cdot 10^{15} {J\over s}$. At that rate, it takes $9.80\cdot 10^{12} s$$=310,607$ years to get the moon going. So basically, every way we look at it, people on the moon will be living in small-scale biodomes for the foreseeable future.
