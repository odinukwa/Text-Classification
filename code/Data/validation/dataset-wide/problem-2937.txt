Yes, it is possible and reason for it depends on the temporal nature of existence and "why". To empirically find that something exist would require a less temporal scale as compared to find why that something exist. The question of why can go on way too far in the past or way too far in the future. So basically you can find the existence in very small time scale whereas "why" would require much larger time scale to get answered. For example: You could come to know the existence of something on your table as soon as you look but to reason why it exist would require you to spend more time as compared to "just looking at it". For some moments you will know the existence of the object on the table without knowing why. 

Check out Appeal to emotion. This seems to best describe the conversation, where the use of word friendship is to focus on emotion than facts. 

We can carry on this process until there is no further substitutions to make. Well, that condition won't ever come in this case as this is plain old infinite recursion due to self reference. If you can't reach a condition where no further substitutions can't be made you simply cannot reach a conclusion. In this particular case you cannot say S is true or false. Similarly if you email a person about some information and he never replied (in terms of whether he knows about it or not) for whatever reason, would you say that the person knows the information or he doesn't. 

Since I am more familiar with the philosophy of anarcho-capitalism, I will answer with respect to that philosophy; others can elaborate on the theory of anarcho-communism. 

The Proudhon objection ("property is theft"): The objection you make to anarcho-capitalism is that "all currently owned land is stolen" and you allege that this would invalidate all ownership claims, and require us to "start over". (I will call this the Proudhon objection after its most famous expositor.) This is not a correct exposition of what happens when there is land-theft in a chain of property transfers under anarcho-capitalism. As with the theft of the pencil above, if there is a case of land-theft then the owner of the land has a right against the thief, but if the thief later transfers that land to a bona fide purchaser without notice, the ownership right in rem may be lost. As stated above, this will depend on the applied principle of transfer, but most anarcho-capitalists have considerable sympathy for the principle that an innocent buyer takes valid title of stolen property. Hence, under this view, it is not correct to conclude that all land titles are invalid, merely because they may have involved past theft. It is certainly true that many land titles trace through a series of transfers where there has been past theft (murder, etc.) in history. This is the point Proudhon makes in his objection to property in land. Under anarcho-capitalist philosophy, this is resolved by the doctrine of allowing the innocent buyer to take legitimate title, with the initial owner retaining a right in personum against the thief. Application of this principle to land-ownership claims based on historical acts of theft means that most land ownership claims would remain valid. 

Something can exist but never be created, until we know what lead to its creation. We humans have this notion that if there exist something than someone or some phenomena must have created that thing. When you see something you will always wonder what created this thing? In that case you can choose any of the below path: 

For me, the term free is not some absolute on/off value, it is not either you have it or you don't. Freedom is about the number of choices you have at a point in time, you may have few choices so less freedom or more choices hence more freedom comparatively. Now let's say you have 3 choices at a point in time and you have choose one of them to move forward, then what should be procedure to determine what choice to make? There could be many ways to do that, for example: A lazy person may choose the one which would need less effort to carry out, a greedy person may choose the one which has most benefits in terms monitory gains and so on. Once you have made a choice and move forward you are presented again with a set of choices depending on what you choose at earlier point. This new set of choices may be large or small as compared to the previous one. The equation in the question says that the procedure that so called intelligent agent will use to decide the choice will be based on which choice right now will allow me with larger number of choices in future set of choices. Obviously the future should be some sensible threshold otherwise the agent will never be able to make the current choice. So, yes, you can be free and intelligent at the same time. 

For axiomatic concepts, any denial of the concept implicitly assumes it to be real, and so it is self-refuting. By the same token, any affirmation of the concept, or attempted justification or "proof" of the concept is "circular" or "question-begging". This circularity of reasoning does not invalidate the axiom, since circularity is a legitimate property of axiomatic concepts. Since axiomatic concepts form the base of reasoning, any discussion of these concepts (including any purported denial of the concept or proof of the concept) implicitly accepts the concept in the first place. 

It is clear from Rand's writing and recorded talks (as well as bibliographic works about her) that she was influenced by Nietzsche in her youth, and had a detailed knowledge of his philosophy and works. However, it is incorrect to regard her philosophy as a blending of his work with individualist philosophy. Though Rand was clearly influenced by Nietzsche in certain respects, her philosophy is contrary to his on all major points in metaphysics, epistemology and ethics. Rand addressed the differences between her own philosophy of Objectivism, and the philosophy of Nietzsche, in detail in a recorded talk in 1967 at Columbia University. She speaks in detail on Nietzsche's views in these fields, and the divergence of his views from her own. Like Nietzsche (and perhaps partly due to his influence), Rand rejected the moral philosophy of altruism as evil. She uses similar terminology to Nietzsche here, referring to it as the "philosophy of death" and explaining her rejection of altruism in a way that is reminiscent of the way Nietzsche wrote about it. (In her talk in the link she makes the point that Nietzsche has some very wise quotes on these matters, and so it appears that she has been influenced by him at least stylistically, in the manner in which she portrays altruism as evil.) Although Rand agrees with Nietzsche that this is a false and evil moral philosophy, and she adopts certain stylistic similarities to him, they disagree profoundly on what the correct moral philosophy is. Nietzsche regards it as good for man to evolve into the "overman" by pursuing the will to power, whereas Rand argues that man should pursue rational egoism, under which man does not sacrifice himself to others or others to himself (for a more details comparison, see e.g., Hicks 2000). 

When something (in this case maths) becomes part of our daily lives in terms of how easy it is to use in our day to day lives and how "obvious" it seems, along with the fact that we are able to describe many phenomena around us using maths (Example: physics), we tend to start believing that "whatever" created this world must be based on the same math that we are used to. IMHO this is just a cognitive bias of humans. The universe is not based on math, instead we developed a tool/language called math which fits our cognitive abilities and its limitations and allow us to understand and explore the world around us. 

You may or you may not reach to the eventual point. We just don't know yet. We are severely limited in our abilities to figure this out. Science says if you observe something, try to find what caused it and what caused that cause and so on. If at the first cause itself you start to believe that there is no cause of it then you have basically blocked yourself at that point for further exploration and experimentation. Look at the history and you will find people whole believed that they know the "starting point" (i.e some form of the word God) were the one who were against the scientific approach. Science never says that there is or there is no "eventual starting point". It only says "We don't know, so lets just keep exploring, keep theorizing and keep proving" 

The quotation about Tristram Shandy appeals to the fact that every page will eventually be finished. This condition is not sufficient to ensure that the task of writing the biography will ever be complete. In an infinite series like this, there is no inconsistency between saying that Shandy will never finish his biography, and saying that any given part of the biography will eventually be written. Intuitively this occurs because the written component increases without bound, but the unwritten component also increases without bound. This is explained in greater detail on mathematics.SE. 

The argument you are referring to is Argument 13 of Hajek (2009) (pp. 229-230). It shows that it is possible to form a sequence of outcomes where the limiting relative frequency of each possible outcome is zero. Hajek argues that strikes against the frequentist interpretation of probability, because it means that the probabilities of all possible outcomes must be zero, which means that one cannot satisfy both the norming axiom and countable additivity axiom simultaneously. This argument is certainly correct, insofar as it goes, but a frequentist might object that the outcome that is used is "improbable" (in some as yet undefined sense) in a hypothetically repeated process. This is a challenge for the frequentist though, and it is potentially fatal. Personally, I think that the best resolution to understanding the relationship between "probability" and "limiting relative frequency" comes from the Bayesian modelling approach, based on an IID model formed from an exchangeable sequence (see e.g., O'Neill 2009 for discussion). If you have an exchangeable sequence of values and you take a subjective interpretation of probability, then it can be shown that ---with probability one--- the limiting relative frequency of any outcome will correspond to the marginal probability of that outcome. (This is encapculated in the famous "representation theorem" of de Finetti, extended by others.) So one way to view this problem is to say that probability should have a "subjectivist" interpretation a-la Bayesian statistics, but in the case of an exchangeable sequence (which represents a repeatable trial where order is non-informative), this "probability" coincides with the "limiting relative frequency" (with probability one) and thus, the frequentist interpretation is also correct in this context (with probability one). This latter interpretation resolves Hajek's objection because under the condition of exchangeability, the objectionable series he is referring to has (subjective) probability zero. Thus, in the above model, we know that the frequentist equivalence holds with (subjective) probability one, and the objectionable examples (e.g., Hajek's Argument 13 example) have total (subjective) probability zero. 

It has taken so many years for humans to develop math and it is still going on and will keep going on. It may feel very easy now to use math in our daily lives but we have reached that stage of easiness over a very long period of time due to some very deep thoughts of many people over this long period of time. So to answer your question, you should interpret the easiness as a result of enormous amount of effort over a long period of time. This reminds me of a quote - "Standing on the shoulders of giants". 

The explanation of something should have one important property - inference i.e given some facts what other facts I can infer about the thing using the explanation. That's the sole reason for the explanation/theory to exist. The thing itself that we are trying to explain is a bunch of facts that we can observe or observed but facts themselves are doesn't have inference ability until used along with some explanation. Now, what if the explanation is complex? What can we say about the inference ability of a complex explanation? The complexity will lead to the increase in the number of inferences the explanation could potentially produce BUT what if the explanation is more complex then the thing (or the collections of facts) themselves? In this case the explanation will infer facts that you can't even observe in the thing itself and that obviously is very weird. 

Part of the issue here is that the people heavily quoting Marx and Engels, and building statues to them, presumably are supporters of their views and hence they do not interpret their ideology as a failure. It is fair to say that Marx and Engels represent two of the primary theorists of socialist ideas and so they are still popular among socialists. (You will find that only a relatively small number socialists have a sound knowledge of his views; the rest merely take for granted that he was an important theorist.) Personally, I agree with the view that socialism is a failure, and the ideas behind it are wrong, but people like me are not heavily citing Marx or building statues to him. Even from a critical perspective (regarding his ideas as incorrect, which I do), Marx (and to a lesser extent Engels) has a justifiably legacy as a thinker for some of the economic and social theories he put forward. A few of his main contributions that stand out are: 

It is important not to conflate metaphysics with epistemology. Your question asks for the "criteria of existence" and seeks a set of criteria for determining when something exists. However, you then posit a set of operational criteria not for existence itself, but for obtaining knowledge of an existent. That is an epistemological ---not a metaphysical--- issue. As a metaphysical issue, there can be no "criteria" for existence since it is not up to us to decide what rules reality must conform to in order to exist. Existence merely exists, and is whatever it is --- it obeys whatever principles are in its nature to obey and it is for us to discover its nature. (One might cleverly argue that the fundamental nature of existence forms the "criteria" of existence, but that would be putting the matter backwards.) In regard to what particular schools of philosophy say about the nature of existence, that is virtually the entire subject of metaphysics (or at least the main starting issue in this field). There are many ideas that have been put forward by different philosophers (and schools of philosophy) throughout history, and it would be difficult to summarise this discussion in a short post, since that would mean recounting the history of the subject of metaphysics. While I won't attempt to do that, perhaps I can nonetheless give you a taste of it by considering a couple of common issues and positions. Is existence a property? To start with, there has been historical debate within metaphysics as to whether "existence" is a property of a thing or a precondition of a thing. Plato believed that the "forms" for various things existed apart from actual objects. Similarly, some of the medieval philosophers (e.g., Aquinas) held that there was a distinction between existence of a thing and its "essence", and they held that a thing could have essence but not existence. Hence, they regarded "existence" as a property of a thing (e.g., a horse has this property but a dragon does not). Other philosophers (e.g., Hume and Kant) regarded this as an illusory distinction, and regarded existence as not being a property, but a precondition for having properties. The noumenal and phenomenal worlds: Once you transition from metaphysics to epistemology, you will encounter Kant's famous arguments about the relation of existence to perception. Kant believed that existence was split ---epistemologically speaking--- between what we perceive with the senses (the phenoumenal world) and things as they are "in-themselves" (the noumenal world, unmediated by the senses). He regarded the noumenal world as the "real world", and denied that we can have knowledge of this through the senses. ("I have therefore found it necessary to deny knowledge, in order to make room for faith.") Is existence all in the mind (idealism)? Berkeley made a similar argument to Kant, but used it as the basis for the idealist claim that existence is merely a mental construct. Berkeley argued that the mind "cannot conceive of bodies existing unthought of", and therefore its only apprehension was of a special kind of existent that exists only in the mind. (The philosopher David Stove famously called this form of argument "the worst argument in the world".) As you can see, there are some arguments about existence which use the duality of what can and can't be perceived to ground a theory of the limits of human knowledge of reality (e.g., Kant's phenomenal world). Arguably the idealist position attempts to elevate this to a claim about the criteria for existence itself, but even here it is usually frames as existence "to the mind". 

I wouldn't call infinite recursion an error, it is more about practical purpose and infinite recursion is of no practical use to us mortals as we cannot use it to reach any conclusion. But in terms of computation an infinite recursion/loop is a bug :) 

A lot of people in science talks about science as a discipline to find the fundamental laws or rules of the nature. They consider these laws to be the underlying mechanism that is making the nature as it is. Usually they will use mathematics equations to describe these so called fundamental laws. Now if you say that a particular mathematical equation describe the trajectory of a ball and this law is the underlying mechanism then who in the nature is actually computing the equation? Is it the ball, the particles, the earth, the air? Well the answer is nobody and that's what makes the whole argument of "underlying laws" or "how nature works" wrong. I guess the proper way to address all the scientific knowledge (or any knowledge for that matter) about nature would be that it is about coming up with "generalized representations" of the observations i.e it just "describe" the observations and it doesn't mean to find how nature actually works.
