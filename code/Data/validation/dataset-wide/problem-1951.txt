It sounds like you got a significant raise recently - a 45% raise in the first year is pretty unusual these days. And you were already told that there would be no pay raise for this move. Yes you can request more pay. But if it were me I would not ask for yet another raise right now, work hard, and consider asking for a raise when my next performance review took place. Many times I have been put in new positions and given a raise later. Perhaps this is what is happening in your situation, particularly when you indicate that this is a "lateral move". Work with your new boss to decide how to handle the increased workload, adjust deadlines as needed, meet new schedules, etc. If you do decide to ask for a raise, you may not want to complain about "working harder" than you did in your "easy" role. That's a good way to ensure you never get a promotion. 

You could try. And you could plead your lack of tax knowledge as the reason. But unless you are willing to walk away from the job over the amount of taxes due on the relocation bonus, you have no leverage. In my experience, companies don't like to renegotiate after an offer has been accepted. For me as a hiring manager, it's a terrible way to start a job - it signals that you either don't think things through completely, or you are high-maintenance. I'd be surprised if the company went back on their offer, so I don't think either way would be fatal. I wouldn't take this route, but it's certainly your call. For me, it seems like it would be a very small amount of money to walk away from a good job, and not worth doing. In the future, try to make sure you understand all aspects of an offer before you accept, so you won't run into a similar uncomfortable situation. 

In general, No. Resumes/CVs should highlight your professional skills, and the attributes which make you a great fit for the job. Unless you are applying for a position where "caring, playing and being with" children are part of the day to day role or preferably part of the job description (nanny? daycare provider?) then these add little value to your CV. Think of it this way, doesn't virtually everyone have "care for their family" in their background? 

Find a more private co-working space. Your current place might offer cubicles or private offices. It might be worth a few extra bucks to move to that. Or they may permit you to bring in portable privacy screens. If not, find a new co-working space with more private arrangements. If privacy is important to you, expect to pay more for the space. Many simply aren't set up for individuals to be private. Some even tout the "collaborative nature" of their workspaces. 

No. As a new graduate with experience, you'll be competing against other new graduates - some with no experience at all. While having development experience might be ideal, all experience has value. You know how to work, take directions, produce output, etc. Hopefully, you'll have a good recommendation from your boss. Those are all positives. 

It's not clear why you would want to work for a company about which you were so critical that you fear you might be caught. At least in my part of the world, you are free to express your dislike for any company. But that company is also free to never hire you. If you are planning to continue to criticize the company once you are hired, that may be rather difficult to accomplish in some parts of the world. 

My wife has worked in dental offices for quite a while, so I have a fair amount of exposure to dental practices. What you describe is certainly more responsibility than most receptionists. And it's more than many front desk positions as well. Handling payroll, in particular, isn't that typical of receptionist/front desk duties, in my experience. 

No. There is no requirement to include all of your schooling on your resume. Since your Ohio State years don't add to your appeal as an employee (and may actually be viewed negatively), you should omit them. The fact that you attained degrees after your other education is all that a potential employer will care about. If somehow you are asked about completing your Associates in only 1.5 years, you may need to open up about your prior courses, since you don't want to lie about it. But I doubt that will happen. 

Find a new job first. During your interviews, make sure to ask enough questions so that you'll know it has everything you want (code reviews, CI server, static code analysis, consistent style guidelines, whatever). Apparently you did a poor job at digging in this time - you don't want to repeat that mistake. Then, once you get a new job offer and acceptance, give an appropriate notice and leave on a good note. Probation periods are for both sides to see if there is a good fit or not. You've already decided the "not" part. Since you haven't felt it necessary to discuss the issues you are seeing with your current manager, and since you appear to already have mentally checked-out of this job, it's probably not worth talking to your manager. 

This time around, learn from your mistake. Do whatever you have to do to stay on your current company's payroll, so you aren't rushed this time. And do your homework during the interview process to make sure this job is a much better fit for your needs and desires. 

If I had been notified about being late twice in a month, and if I cared about the job, I'd get in early enough so that I had very little risk of being late again. If that means I needed to target 8:45 to ensure I always punched in before 9:00, then that's what I would do. You have learned that timeliness is very important to your boss. And you have learned that your boss will be watching you going forward, and checking when you clock in. How you react to what you have learned is now up to you. You can take positive action and try as hard as possible never to be late again (or perhaps even be early to show your boss you care about your job), or you can continue to do what you have done so far (and perhaps demonstrate to your boss that you don't care). You know which your boss would prefer, now you need to decide if this is a boss you want to continue working for. 

Maybe, maybe not - it depends on the specifics of the Agreement. And remember, no matter what your interpretation, people can spend a lot of time and money defending a lawsuit - even if they end up winning. 

Of course it's okay. First, they might be very happy to have a bit more of your time, particularly if you have been very helpful and professional during your notice period. Second, even if they say "No", you have lost nothing. It's unfortunate that your estimate was off by so much ("a month or two"), but it shouldn't hurt to ask. 

In general, if you are getting a bad feeling about your potential future manager (or any aspect of the company culture) and that feeling is strong enough, you should consider if you really want to work for this company or not. You may have a lot of interactions with your manager, and in many ways your manager controls your career within the company. It's very common for people who choose to leave to cite their relationship with their boss as the top reason. You can search for "top reasons people quit", for example: $URL$ On the other hand, you may have very little interaction with the HR rep after you are hired. Their behavior probably shouldn't concern you much, but you should always listen to your own feelings. 

If tech companies are stupid enough to ask the same technical questions repeatedly for which an enterprising candidate could easily get prepared, then they will presumably "suffer" accordingly. It's not all that hard to come up with many questions for virtually any job. If they can't distinguish between candidates who have memorized the answers from those who really understand what they are talking about, then perhaps they deserve whatever they will get. When I interviewed candidates, I never asked questions that were so simple to answer. I always asked questions that demonstrate some thought and some understanding of the process. I never asked "puzzle" questions. And I seldom repeated the same question. In my experience, hiring tech workers isn't like handing out an SAT test or entrance exam (or at least it shouldn't be). 

In my experience most either reply with a standard (and often automated) response like "Thanks for applying. If we are interested, we'll get back to you." Or, they don't reply at all. Do you follow up personally and individually to everyone who adds a cover letter to your online form? If so, why do you exclude applicants who don't include a cover letter. You ask "if it's rude?" That's hard to say, particularly when you are posting a job online and inviting online response. It's basically all set up to be impersonal. In my company, HR posts all job openings and screens all responses. We get hundreds of responses for every job posting - the vast majority of which are clearly not a fit. They have an automated "thank you" for submissions, but I believe they only respond personally when I need more information or want to conduct a phone interview with a promising applicant. I don't think HR is being rude - just following typical "big company" protocol. 

It's not extremely unusual to be fired in the middle of a pay period. And since you indicate that you were "expecting this to happen", then something must have triggered the immediate dismissal. In the US, you are entitled to be paid for all of the hours you actually worked, no matter when in the pay cycle you are dismissed. If you haven't yet received payment for the hours you actually worked, and the day has passed when you would normally receive your pay check, you should talk with your boss. Ask why you haven't been paid yet, and when you should expect to receive your check. If you feel that your employer isn't going to pay you what you are owed, you may need to contact your state's Attorney General, or the local Department of Labor. 

It would have been perfectly reasonable to say something like "Well, until I learn the details of the job and in particular if it will be part-time or full-time I can't tell if that's going to work for me or not." Then you would probably have to discuss what you would do if it were part-time. I assume you would find yourself a second part-time job so that you could support yourself. That's a reasonable follow-up answer. 

If you are asked questions that you don't want to answer for any reason, simply decline politely. Something like "I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable answering that question." would suffice. Of course, declining to answer an interview question isn't usually perceived as a good thing by the interviewer. And it could cause a rejection. Still, if you feel strongly that you don't want to answer any question - don't. 

Call, talk to the appropriate person (HR or hiring manager), and ask if there has been a hangup. A full week is a reasonable amount of time to wait, unless you were told it would take longer. 

You need to ask your boss what you should be doing if you don't have enough work to fill the hours. Since your boss gave you the books, maybe this is a hint that reading them during work hours is acceptable. It's also possible that there are tasks that need doing which you haven't heard about yet. But the only one who can tell you for sure (and the only one who could praise you or penalize you) is your boss. Ask. 

It depends on your friend's employer. If caught lying on a job application, your friend could be fired immediately, or the application could be tossed if discovered before he is hired. And your friend's professional reputation could take a severe hit. Or not. The employer could just laugh. Or the employer could just shrug but your friend could lose a level of trust. Here are more reports of consequences: $URL$ As a manager, it's very important to me that I am able to trust folks on my team. Lying puts a big dent in that trust. Whenever I'm interviewing a candidate, any lie usually means he/she is crossed off the list immediately. If you search here at workplace (perhaps for "lying on resume" or such) you'll see that this topic has surfaced many times in the past. Personally, I think you gave your friend very poor advice. Not only are you making your friend into a liar, you are making everyone at your company liars as well. Your mileage may vary. 

I'm not sure how to characterize "normal", but it's certainly not that unusual. It's a pretty standard tactic for some companies. 

Present it as temp work or volunteer work, depending on the nature of the tasks and compensation themselves. The term "microwork" is not a typical term (at least in the US) and would need to be explained to overcome any confusion or negative misconceptions. You don't want to start a conversation with a future employer about what you actually mean by an obscure term for a rare work situation. 

Laughing and declining was exactly the right thing to do in this situation. While it may have felt awkward, you were wise to choose that path. Your response was graceful enough and I'd be shocked if there were any damages to relationships. Don't worry about it so much! If it happens again (and if you want to drink when you are 21), you might choose to add "Save that beer for when I'm 21, Ok?" but say it with a smile and laugh again. If it happens again (and if you don't want to drink when you are 21), you might choose to add "Give that beer to one of these folks who enjoys drinking - I'm sure it won't be hard to find one!" but again say it with a smile and a laugh. 

Three years sounds rather long to me. I have typically only seen 1-year non-compete clauses in my locale. The duration of the non-compete usually has nothing at all to do with the duration of the contract. 

In my (US) company, and every (US) company I have ever worked for over the past 35 years, this is exactly what would happen under the same circumstances. Raises are not automatic, and not given out to people who won't be around. 

It's unlikely you can have any success reporting them to any authority. You initially decided to interview with them, so it's not unreasonable for them to think that they might be able to convince you if they try hard enough. Instead, keep blocking all calls from this company, and block their emails as well. Once they stop getting responses from you, they'll move on to other more likely candidates (recruiters don't like to waste their time). In the future, you might wish to refrain from cooperating with a recruiter when you don't actually want to be recruited. 

Your intuition is correct. Stick with the "form letter" approach. Letters of resignation are just a formality, and not even required in many companies (in my part of the world at least). The intent of such a letter is simply to start the ball rolling on closing out your current job, with your boss, with HR, etc. Keep it short, quick, and to the point. Leave out personal issues and feelings. If you really want to convey your personal reasons for leaving, have a private conversation with your manager, and potentially with your HR rep. Perhaps even wait until your exit interview. (You should probably search through the Workplace and look for questions/answers concerning whether or not you should talk about your dislikes at all, before you decide to broach that subject. That question comes up occasionally here. I've pretty much consistently recommended keeping those feelings to yourself in the past.) 

I'm guessing that this sort of employee-participation game (or at least the Dumb Charades game) is something new in your office? Office workers may be reluctant to participate in something new like this for fear that they will look unprofessional, or that they will feel awkward. I have always found that getting the top person to participate wholeheartedly is the key to success. That signals to others that this is "fun", "safe" and "something you should participate in". One way to show everyone how much fun this will be is to create a short video of the CEO/General Manager/top person participating. Email it around and let others know that if they attend they will get to see the CEO acting "Dumb". Take still pictures from the video and make them a prominent part of your posters. 

It would be a red flag for me. Passing on this offer makes sense to me. If this is the way they treat people who they presumably want to sign on, then you can imagine how they treat people in other circumstances. You might want to try and get some sort of reason out of them, if possible. And you should tell all your friends and associates to avoid this company.
