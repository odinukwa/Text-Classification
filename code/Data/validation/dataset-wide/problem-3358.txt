The place to look is Herodotus. The only unaugmented, contracted imperfects forms I see there are ἑσσοῦντο, ἑσσοῦτο 'defeat'; Herodotus did not contract normally. 

As @user6726 points out, IPA can be used for phonemes, and in fact is. The IPA guidelines (at least the 1948 version) suggests that if you're using IPA for a broad transcription (and a phonemic analysis is broad), you should prefer the more familiar-looking, Roman glyph over the less familiar. So if you have a choice of <e> or <ɛ> for a phoneme, use <e>. 

Ancient Greek nouns could be definite or indefinite in the absence of an explicit definite article: the definite article develops only gradually in ancient Greek, and even in Koine there are contexts where Greek does not use a definite article and English would. But without a definite article, the default assumption would be indefinite. 

If those verbs had a long (or doubled) vowel in Latin as their theme vowel then they were most likely going to be pronounced with a wide e - or a wide o - in conjugations where they retain the tonic stress. In the following examples I'll use first person singular i.e. Eventually those wide mid vowels became and in Spanish, because Spanish phonology does not contain wide mid vowels. Some simplifications are going to be made here, but here are some etymological timelines: 

The second vowel alternation rule is a general lowering of theme vowels for mid height root vowels, where the first rule does not apply. 

In the First, Second and Fourth declensions, Nominitive Plural is the same as Genitive Singular. The other two don't follow the same pattern, but don't deviate very far from it. Even in English, we say: 

The answer from @hippietrail's correspondent is pretty much on point, but the specifics have not quite been dealt with fully. So: Sabbat-ismos "sabbathism, sabbathisation, sabbathising" is indeed a deverbal noun, arising from the verb sabbatizo "to act in a way associated with the/a Sabbath", i.e. "to observe the Sabbath". 

Pontic Greek, historically spoken in Northern Turkey, has acquired an animacy distinction on top of its inherited gender system; see e.g. $URL$ : 

This is properly the domain of $URL$ , but at least one actor in Discovery (the one who played T'Kuvma) made a point of saying that he wanted his Klingon to sound African ($URL$ citing $URL$ ). Different prosthetics are likely in play as well. 

See Why "agoraphobia" not "agorophobia"? myia is a first declension noun, so originally in Greek the correct answer was myiaphagia, just as agoraphobia is actually the correct form, historically. But the -o- of the second declension extended to first declension nouns in compounds very very early—so early that -a- compounds are the archaic exception in Classical Greek, rather than the rule. The normally expected connective is indeed -o-, and that's what fdb's answer ($URL$ reports. 

As the other poster indicated, accent is the application of native phonology to another language. However, if someone grows up speaking two languages, they would necessarily have less of an accent than someone who speaks just one language. Two languages necessarily have a larger phoneme inventory than just one, which means the speaker has more native phonemes to choose from. The perfect example is from Portuguese. In my experience monolingual Spanish speakers have a really hard time pronouncing European Portuguese sounds, particularly the reduced vowels and opened variations of E and O. Whereas English speakers have trouble pronouncing rolled R and reduced consonants such as the approximates of B, V and D. In my experience, students who grew up speaking Spanish and English do wonderfully learning the Lisbon variant of Portuguese. In the case of Mandarin, from what I've heard the Chinese usually classify foreigners differently. Since that language is so unrelated to Spanish and English, typically they just say someone had a Western accent, which it is usually not easy to determine the origin. 

Yes. The "ideology" meaning is already around in ancient Greek (because the underlying verb suffix means "act in a matter associated with", and can mean "be a partisan of"). But the point of the noun suffix is to make the verb into an action noun. 

Proto-Indo-European has gone through different stages of development historically, which represent higher levels of abstraction. In particular, the $URL$ which dates from 1879 but which gained widespread acceptance only after it was used to make sense of Hittite in the 1930s, did away the reconstruction of long vowels and /a/ in Indo-European, by explaining them via laryngeals (h1, h2, h3). While the reconstruction of long vowels and /a/ is legitimate, they are held to represent a later stage in the development of Indo-European. (So /h₂e, eh₂/ > /a/.) And even after the laryngeal theory gained general acceptance, references were slow to adopt it; Pokorny's influential dictionary dates from 1959, but still uses the older vowels. Etymonline reflects the older, pre-laryngeal understanding of PIE (which corresponds to a later stage of PIE). Wiktionary reflects the more recent, laryngeal understanding. In addition, Etymonline seems to be randomly dropping diacritics, reflecting bad transcription online; the differentiation between velar g and palatal ǵ has been in the reconstructions of PIE since the start. Nothwithstanding the usual cautions about Wiki sources, Wiktionary is by and large reliable for PIE. 

However the following verbs are not subject to the rule because the theme verbs are short, marked with a caret. poner (ponĕre), cocer (coquĕre), beber (bibĕre), meter (mittĕre), romper (rumpĕre) 

I've looked in the Real Academia Española dictionary and I can't find any information regarding why Spanish uses the preposition for cooking styles, and I've noticed French and Italian do it too. I know that the languages use the word, but I don't understand how in a broad sense outside of cuisine. 

The word that interests me the most is the last one podes which is pronounced in rapid speech something like "pɔdʃ". Could the last sound cluster "dʃ" be considered an affricate, or is there a requirement that the affricate be entirely voiced or devoiced? 

The fact that the perfective simplex δω is not discussed separately from the perfective past είδα and the perfective imperative δες is... regrettable. But yes, Triantafyllides does give principal parts. 

The Good Morning/Good Day formula is pervasive in European languages, but is presumably not universal, and presumably it has not always been around. Do we have any evidence of when and where it first originated? 

It's a value judgement, clearly. To be litos is to be plain as a positive value judgement; cf. English "plain-spoken". Plainness of speech was extended to avoiding superlatives in speech, as excessively emotive: Ancient Greek culture valued "moderation", which includes understatement. Saying something is "not uncommon" or "not ungraceful" increases processing time, but the praiseworthy plainness from an Ancient Greek perspective is not about processing simplicity (and reading isn't really the point here—these were conventions of oratory). The praiseworthy plainness is about making a show of being reluctant to go overboard in one's positive descriptions. That's speculation based on what I know of Greek and Ancient Greeks. While $URL$ reports that the rhetorical figure is already in place in Homer, LSJ reports that the earliest use of litotes to describe it is in late Roman grammarians: $URL$ commentary on Virgil, $URL$ commentary on Terence (4th to 5th centuries AD.) 

Given that these two are the only accepted vowel alternation conventions in Portuguese, what is causing some speakers to alternate the in to a fronted or even ? This convention is especially prevalent in the first person form . I'll put a URL to a song here if anybody is interested in hearing it - $URL$ 

I am currently trying to learn Tamil. My friend who is teaching me seems to be making a clicking sound with one word in particular, and she can't seem to tell she's making it. The word is குளம் pronounced as [kʊ˞ɭʼʌm] - meaning pool or pond. Every time she says it my mind is blown when she transitions from the retroflex ɭ to the ʌ. The distance between these two sounds seems to be the maximum possible distance it can travel between two sounds. It's as if the tongue is slammed into the floor of the mouth causing a click-type sound. About 50% of the time she says the word I can hear a distinct click. I'm wondering if any phonologists out there have noticed these kinds of unintentional click sounds in any languages. Also, at what point would a click serve some sort of contrastive phoneme? Is it even possible for a language as old as Tamil to develop clicks? 

Yes. The Value Added Tax is /fipia/ (foros prostiθemenis aksias). The Communist Party of Greece is /kukue/ (komunistiko koma elaðas). Notably, initialisms in Greek often use the "informal" alphabet used in early schooling for spelling out words, where vowel letters are pronounced as phonemes, and letters as the letter followed by /u/ or /i/, rather than the official letter names: /fipia/, not /fi pi alfa/, /kukue/ alongside /kapa kapa epsilon/. Greek does not pronounce initialisms for proper names (that I know of), although initials do show up; ΓΑΠ for George (son of) Andreas Papandreou. 

The earliest such proposal was Ioannis Vilaras' in 1814, proposing eta (not iota) for all /i/ sounds, and omicron for /o/: $URL$ The most successful such proposal was in the Soviet Union in the 30s, when all Greek (including Demotic, Pontic, and Mariupolitan) was written phonetically in the Greek alphabet (with upsilon for /u/ and universal final sigma)—the latter two variants with new digraphs like ςς for /ʃ/. Those digraphs have been revived in the Pontic Wikipedia's orthography. The digraphs for voiced/(optionally) prenasalised stops are arguably awkward, and transcription of dialect can dodge them; I'm not aware of orthographic reform proposals taking issue with them, though. 

In Portuguese there are two accepted reasons vowels in verbs alternate in height. The vowel harmonizing rule states that where the theme vowel (a from -ar, e from -er, and i from -ir) is deleted from the conjugation and retains tonic stress, the root vowel is changed to match the height of the theme vowel.. 

In English, there is no change in meaning due to the change in palatalization, like there is in Russian. We have no contrastive words or minimal pairs due to palatalization. Дан [dan] and дань [danʲ] are different, meaning "Dane" and "tribute" but this differentiation doesn't occur in English. That doesn't mean that palatalization isn't an interesting concept in English though. For example: Western American speakers render "education" as [e.d͡ʒɪ̈.ˈkej.ʃɪ̈n], resulting from the palatalization of the 'd' followed by the /ju/. Some British accents pronounce "tune" as [t͡ʃun] for the same reason, and despite these siginficant changes in pronunciation due to palatalization, they do not change meaning. Our /ɹ/ sound has an interesting effect on palatalization as well in some dialects: "try" -> [t͡ʃɹaj] "dragon" -> [ˈd͡ʒɹæ.gɪ̈n] In conclusion we have quite the opposite phenomenon occurring in English, words can be significantly palatalized but do not change meaning.
