It's guaranteed to be one you like. Some dip belts are just poorly designed. It most likely will be in better condition than the one at the gym. Dip belts tend to be very robust anyway, but the chain links and clips can wear out over time. Gyms can go weeks without replacing or fixing it. You'll have one if you ever go to another gym that doesn't have a dip belt. It's only got your germs on it and not hundreds of other people who use it. 

This would mean that the faster you run, the faster you breath, and the slower you run the slower you breath. If you focus on this for enough time, you should eventually just start doing it automatically. You can drink water any time. Although drinking a lot of water before a jog may cause minor stomach pain. I've personally never had a problem with it, but I know people who have. I would say it's an absolute requirement to drink water before and during a jog on hot days. 

Beyond that there are people who are just physically better built for a certain sport which gives them a competitive advantage. For example, Michael Phelps is regarded by some as having the "perfect body" for swimming. Beyond that you start getting in to even more theoretical limitations on what the human body is physically capable of. So far, to my knowledge, we have not found these limitations, but one must assume that they exist. The human spine can only hold so much weight, the legs can only move so fast, etc. Beyond that you start getting in to what's physically possible. For example, if Superman existed, he wouldn't be able to pick up a plane because his hands would punch straight through it. 

On top of this, there is a very lengthy stackexchange question that already covers this topic in far more detail. Oddly the top answer points to a lot of the same studies that are in the Examine article, but it comes to a overall different conclusion. What's missing is just how much all this effects performance. There are no studies as far as I know that show a performance comparison between sexually active and abstinent men. We know that more testosterone typically means better recovery and performance (that's why steroids work). Overall though I do not think it would have that much of an effect on the average person. For #2: No. People do HIIT and still make massive gains. In fact, people do HIIT because it's better for keeping gains. #3 & #4: Please... Even the most intense session isn't going to put a dent in glycogen. And if there really is an energy problem, them maybe you could spare to do some cardio. #5: You could say this about literally everything that's not exercising. You'll make progress as long as you stay committed and consistent with training. 

Deloading should, ideally, be planned and deliberate part of a training cycle. It typically happens every 4-8 weeks depending on fitness level and training intensity. The idea is to give the body an extended period of recovery and be completely fresh to start a new training cycle. You can typically tell when it's coming time because you'll start feeling constantly exhausted and weak. You may even start failing to complete workouts and seeing numbers go down. When the deload finally hits, you do the same things at a reduced volume and weight. In severe cases, you may just take a full week off. Your issue sounds a bit different. You have DOMs that are so severe that is borders on injury (if it isn't a straight up injury). That typically happens when going way too hard and way too fast without giving your body enough time to adapt to increased training loads. So here's a couple rules that are good to follow. If the DOMs are so severe that it impedes your ability to complete a workout, then you treat it as an injury. You sit back, heal, then try again and a lower intensity and build up. You'll just have to live with the fact that you're not at that level yet. If the DOMs are more of a nuisance and you're not impeded, then continue on. EDIT: In regards to #1 and #2. The main difference is how to deload. People prepping for a competition should probably use a deload to practice and get better in technique. You do the same movements, but in a 10-20% drop in weight. It also helps in that it ensures you never have any downtime (which can lead to severe DOMs when they get back to full volume as mentioned earlier). People not prepping for a competition have more leeway in how they deload. They just have to do how they feel best suits them. 

Whey is a byproduct of milk after it's been curdled and strained to form cheese. So taking whey is not much different than drinking milk. If you can digest milk (I.E. not lactose intolerant), then you can digest whey. If you are lactose intolerant, then you probably would need to take a Lactaid or something to digest it. Though, a better alternative would be to just not take it. There are plant and egg based supplements that can be bought instead of whey. Or fulfill your protein needs through regular diet over supplementation. 

Limited physical ability. For example, people unfortunate enough to be born with skeletal deformities would not be as capable as someone without such impairments. Limited ability to grow muscle. Limited ability to recover. 

A person's overall height is determined by their genetics. You can stunt a person's growth by malnutrition, but a person can not grow taller than what he or she is destined to be. The reason people may think sports make people taller is because professional athletes tend to be taller than average. That is because height gives a slight advantage in some sports. It has nothing to do with any kind of extended growth. 

I'm not aware of any studies where exercise effects circadian rhythms. Although if it did, I imagine would be because you started working out in times you normally prepare for sleep. So if you went to bed at 10 pm on rest days and midnight on workout days, your body may have a difficult time adjusting to that. Whether exercise effects your sleep generally depends on how intense the workout (there's intense and there's intense), how much you're overreaching, and just yourself. Everyone acts to stimuli differently. Exercising in evening could: Significantly raise your adrenaline and cortisol levels. In which case you'd be tossing in turning for hours trying to bring it down. Or Raise your adrenaline, but then you come crashing down hard shortly after. In which case you'll actually sleep quite well. Or Do absolutely nothing. You'll get home and just go to sleep as if nothing happened. The first case is usually a sign that you simply went too hard at the gym. It is also a good indicator that you're overreaching and it may be time to slow down for a week. Oddly, not sleeping can cause you to get in to this state much sooner. Sleep is very important. It is a vital tool for both weight management and recovery, as well as just overall health and cognizance. So if you must workout at night, here are some tips: 

Running up hill is almost always better for cardio and fat loss as one would expect. Not so much for muscle gaining, though it would contribute more to legs than running on a flat road. Running downhill on the other hand is almost worse in every way because as you stated, it's easier. Given the same amount of effort, running on the flat loop vs the hilly loop will yield roughly the same results. You'd run slightly slower on the uphill parts and slightly faster on the downhill. You don't mention how steep the hill is, but you mentioned that you actively try to slow down so I'm going to assume it's fairly steep. One big downside to steep downhill running is the impact it has on your legs and feet. Because you're fighting gravity, you're actively trying to slow yourself down. In order to do that, you have to basically lean backwards which causes you to run at a very weird angle. Your feet will strike hard at the heels, and the impact travels up the entire leg. All of which can cause ankle, knee, and hip problems eventually. A more advanced way to run downhill is to actually use gravity to your advantage and run faster so that you maintain the proper form down the hill. The steeper and longer the hill, the harder it is to do without tripping as you will be going much, much faster than you're used to. Although for a beginner, I would suggest a simpler approach. Run up the hill version and then walk back down it. You would be pushing yourself harder on the uphill movements and then using the downhill as a rest period. Some routes with many crests and valleys can be used as a form of interval training where you sprint on the uphill and then walk on the downhill parts. You can use the flat loop as well in which you run consistently around at a more moderate pace. 

As you can see there's lots of protein, lots of carbohydrates, a little fat, and lots of calories for one serving. What you can do instead is replace the weight gainer with foods that are far cheaper. I don't know what kinds of foods are easily available in India, so it is hard to make suggestions. You would want to look for things that are high in carbs and protein. You can mix and match foods. You don't have to have it in one serving, so it can be spread out through the whole day. 

The most basic definition of the Anaerobic Threshold is where the body generates more lactic acid than it can flush out. So if you were to make a line graph in which one line represents the rate lactic acid increase and the other line represents the rate of lactic acid decrease, the point at which the lines cross would technically be the "anaerobic threshold". Lactic acid builds up faster as the intensity of a workout increases. The rate at which it's disposed of is relatively constant. Sprinters can train above this point without much issue because their running is in very short bursts. Endurance athletes though need to stay below this point in order to continue on without having to stop for rest. You can, however, improve your ability to remove lactic acid through consistent training. As such, the speeds, distances, and times would increase. I think the "metabolic shift" part comes from where people are told that at a certain intensity, your body starts generating energy through anaerobic (no oxygen) means rather than aerobic (oxygen). When you're aerobic, you generate energy by using fat whereas you would use glucose if you're in the anaerobic phase. The idea being that you would burn more fat if you stayed within this aerobic center. You'll often see charts on cardio machines that say "aerobic between 60% to 70% of VO2max" or something. This is a general over-simplification of how the body generates energy. What the body chooses as a source of energy is far, far more complex than that. It is based off a large number of factors. Also, the body is using both systems for energy pretty much all the time. You are in fact using both energy systems right now reading this while at rest (I assume you're at rest). The body will start using more of its anaerobic energy system as a workout increases in intensity because it needs that extra energy to perform its duties. It will, however, never stop using the aerobic system. 

Having had flat feet for as long as I can remember, I've done quite a bit of research and tried a lot of things regarding collapsed arches. You'll find no shortage of people claiming they can fix flat feet if you buy their program or you can reverse it by using various exercises. Plenty of barefoot running websites that claim running barefoot will fix flat feet. First you have to look at the cause of flat feet. There's nothing that can be done if you are genetically predisposed to have flat feet (without something drastic like surgery). Saying you can fix genetics is like saying hanging upside down will make you taller by elongating your spine, ribs, and core muscles. The bones and tendons are set in their ways. You'll just have to live with that. It's also possible to get flat feet from weak tendons or being morbidly obese. This is where you'll start getting a lot of mixed answers on whether or not this is reversible. Most of the more medically orientated sites and podiatrists that I've talked to seem to think that collapsed arches are not reversible once they occur, so I'm going to go with that answer. Now, that isn't to say that stretching exercises are useless. They won't fix flat feet or increase the arch, but they will most certainly strengthen the tendons and muscles around the foot and ankle. Stronger feet leads to less pain and injury. Anecdotal side note, I would refrain from trying barefoot running for strengthening feet. It's included in the answer because there are claims everywhere that it's the cure-all for collapsed arches. There is just absolutely no shock absorption with flat feet, so the full force of the impact of each stroke goes straight up your leg. Barefoot, or minimal-support walking though may have some benefit since the impact is considerably less. 

Weight gainers are not special. They are just really calorically dense supplements with a very specific macro distribution. So if you look at say, the Optimum Nutrition Pro Gainer nutrients you can see this: 

The kind of cardio that the Knuckols article recommends is steady state cardio on a bike for up to two hours a week. Where-as the Juggernaut article recommends more explosive, polymetrics style cardio three to four times a week for about 20 minutes. The point is, cardio is not a "gains killer" that some people seem to think it is. If you want more real-world examples, look at Rugby players and American Football players. Two types of athletes that tend to be incredibly strong and well conditioned. 

In specific to the Jeff Galloway Run/Walk method. The point of the method is to ease the stress that running has during training and races. It splits the race up in to running segments and walking segments with the idea that the walking segments facilitate recovery which allow the running segments to be faster and easier than if you just ran the entire course. Each walking segment is deliberate and planned. The runner doesn't run up to the point of exhaustion and is forced to slow down. Instead, the runner slows down to a walk well before that. How fast should the walking be? A leisurely pace. Walking segments typically are not that long to begin with. The point is to give some rest period for recovery. Though, it won't necessarily hurt to speed walk if you can spare it. How fast should the running be? During training, you should be running at a "conversational pace". Meaning, you should be able to hold a conversation with somebody while running. A common test (if you're in the U.S.) is the "Pledge of Allegiance" test where you recite the Pledge of Allegiance. If you can't finish a sentence without gasping for air, then you're going too fast. Faster, more fit people, can do this at a faster pace, but it's always relatively easy. During a race, you don't necessarily have to change the tactic. Especially if you're only competing against your own time. A training schedule should have a period of rest for you body to overcompensate. Plus all the adrenaline and people around you. It all combined generally would push you to have a faster "conversational" pace. (As a side note, it's never a good idea to do something dramatically different on race day.) Does it change for half-marathon or full-marathon? The running and walking paces do not change for these. The lengths of the segments may change depending on the training requirements.
