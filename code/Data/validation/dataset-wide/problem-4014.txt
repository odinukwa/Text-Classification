What are the examples of interesting combinatorial identities (e.g. bijection between two sets of combinatorial objects) that can be proved using representation theory, or has some representation theoretic interpretation. Please also mention whether a purely combinatorial proof is known in each case. 

Consider the $n$-element subsets $\{a_1<a_2<\cdots <a_n\}$ of $\{1,\ldots ,2n\}$ satisfying $a_i\geq 2i$ for all $i=1,\ldots ,n$. The number of such subsets is given by $${2n\choose n}-{2n\choose n-1}=\frac{1}{n+1}{2n\choose n},$$ which is the $n$th Catalan Number. I want to know if the $q$-Catalan number $$\frac{q^{n}}{[n+1]_q}{2n\choose n}_q={2n\choose n}_q-{2n\choose n-1}_q$$ counts some kind of special $n$-dimensional subspaces inside $\mathbb{F}_q^{2n}$? Note that ${2n \choose n}_q$ is the total number of $n$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_q^{2n}$ ($\mathbb{F}_q$ denotes finite field of order $q$). 

I will describe two ways to associate irreducible representations of $S_n$ with polynomials inside the ring of symmetric polynomials and I want to know if there is any connection between the two. $\textit{via Specht polynomials}:$ For a partition $\lambda\vdash n$, let $\{T\}$ be a $\lambda $-tabloid. Define the following polynomial $$E_{\{T\}}:=\prod\limits_{i=1}^{d}x_i^{\left(\text{number of the row in which }i\text{ lies in the tableau }T\right)-1}.$$ Then $\{E_{\pi\{T\}} : \pi\in S_n/S_{\lambda_1}\times\cdots\times S_{\lambda_k}\} $ is a $\mathbb{C}$-basis for $U_\lambda:=\text{Ind}^{S_n}_{S_{\lambda_1}\times\cdots\times S_{\lambda_k}} (1)$. And the following polynomials $$F_T=\prod\limits_{i < j;\ i\text{ and }j\text{ lie in the same column of }T}\left(x_i-x_j\right)$$ spans the irreducible representation $V_\lambda$ of $S_n$. Now, we can, for example, take the sum of $E_{\pi\{T\}}$'s and get the symmetric polynomial associated to $U_\lambda$ and similarly get symmetric polynomial associated to $V_\lambda$. $\textit{via Schur polynomials}:$ For a partition $\lambda\vdash n$, let $h_\lambda$ be the complete symmetric polynomial and $s_\lambda$ be the Schur polynomial. Define the map $\phi$ from the set of all symmetric polynomials to the Grothendieck group of representations of $S_n$ by $\phi (h_\lambda )=U_\lambda $. Then $\phi$ is an isomorphism and $\phi (s_\lambda )=V_\lambda$. $\textbf{Questions}$: Is there any relationship between $h_\lambda$ and $E_{\pi\{T\}}$'s and between $s_\lambda$ and $F_T$'s ? Can we construct a basis of the ring of symmetric polynomials using $E_{\pi\{T\}}$'s ? 

Consider the alternating subgroup $A_n$ of the symmetric group $S_n$ (or in general any Coxeter Group). Is there a simplicial complex whose $h$-vector $h_i$ equals the number of elements of $A_n$ with $i$ descents? Note that the $h$-vector of the Coxeter Complex of $S_n$ counts descent in $S_n$. I found this paper where "Coxeter-like complexes" for the alternating subgroup was defined (but these complexes depend on the choice of a distinguished generator). I am not sure if one can compute $h$-vectors of these complexes or show that they count descents. Any help regarding this will be appreciated. 

What information does the automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ of a graph $G$ give us about the number of it's spanning trees? If not in general, can anything be said about some special cases, for example, when $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ is the symmetric group $S_r$ for some $r\leq |V(G)|$? What if $G$ is regular/strongly regular? 

The generalized Rogers-Ramanujan identity has the following form $$\sum_{k_1\geq\cdots\geq k_r\geq 0}\frac{x^{k_1^2+\cdots +k_r^2+k_i+\cdots +k_r}}{(x)_{k_1-k_2}\cdots (x)_{k_{r-1}-k_r}(x)_{k_r}}=\prod_{j>0,\, j\not\equiv 0,\pm i\pmod{2r+1}}\frac{1}{1-x^j},$$ where $r\geq 1, 1\leq i\leq r+1$ and $(x)_n:= (1-x)(1-x^2)\cdots (1-x^n)$ . I am looking for a Rogers-Ramanujan type identity, where in the RHS, the product is over all $j\geq u+1$ (for a given $u\in\mathbb{N}$), if we let $r\to\infty$. For example, the RHS could be $$\prod_{j>0,\, j\not\equiv 0,\pm 1,\ldots ,\pm u\pmod{2r+1}}\frac{1}{1-x^j},$$ what could be the LHS in this case? Are such identities there in the literature? Clearly, for $u=1$, the the above mentioned Rogers-Ramanujan identity with $i=1$ is the answer. 

I'm looking for a reference for the following so-called Volume Function $V_n$, which is intended to be a Banach/normed vector space generalization of the determinant. Let $X$ be a Banach space with norm $|\cdot|$. When $x \in X$ and $W \subset X$ is a closed vector space not containing $x$, write $\text{dist}(x, W) = \inf\{|x - w| : w \in W \}$. Write $\langle x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k \rangle$ for the finite dimensional subspace of $X$ spanned by $x_1, \cdots x_k \in X$. For $n \geq 1$ and any $n$-tuple of vectors $x_1, \cdots, x_n \in X$, define $$ V_n(x_1, \cdots, x_n) = |x_n| \cdot \text{dist}(x_{n-1}, \langle x_n \rangle) \cdot \text{dist}(x_{n-2}, \langle x_{n-1}, x_n \rangle ) \cdots \text{dist}(x_1, \langle x_2, \cdots, x_n \rangle ) $$ Notice that when $X$ is a Hilbert space, $V_n(x_1, \cdots, x_n) = |x_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge x_n|$ is precisely the (unsigned) volume of the parallelopiped spanned by $x_1, \cdots, x_n$. I found this definition in the monograph of Z. Lian and K. Lu, where they use it to prove their version of the (Oseledets) Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem for asymptotically compact cocycles on Banach spaces. There they prove some properties for $V_n$, but they don't give any independent references. I think there ought to be, as this seems to me a natural way to define volume on normed vector spaces in general. 

This is a standard argument in Pesin Theory, which I'll sketch below leaving details to the reader. Let's pretend $M = \mathbb T^d, d \geq 2$, so that I don't have to bother with charts (the proof is local anyway and so can be transcribed verbatim onto a single chart). Let $x, x_n \in \Lambda_{\chi, l}, n \geq 0$ and assume (i) $x_n \to x$ and (ii) $\dim E^u(x_n) \equiv \dim E^u(x)$. Without loss we can pass to a subsequence $x_{n}$ along which $\{E^u(x_{n})\}$ converges to a subspace $E \subset T_x M$. It suffices to show that $E = E^u(x)$. If not, then there is a unit vector $e \in E$ for which $e = e^u + e^s$ with $e^s \neq 0$ (here we split according to $E^u \oplus E^s$ at $x$). Now, $e$ is the limit of some sequence of unit vectors $e_n \in E^u(x_n)$. Below, $k$ is fixed and $n \geq 1$: $$ \| df^{-k}_x e\| \leq \| df^{-k}_x - df^{-k}_{x_n} \| + \| df^{-k}_{x_n}(e - e_n)\| + \| df^{-k}_{x_n} e_n\| $$ Taking $n$ to infinity, the first and second terms vanish, while the third term is $\leq l e^{- k \chi}$ for all $n$. On the other hand, $$ \| df^{-k}_x e \| \geq \| df^{-k}_x e^s\| - \| df^{-k}_x e^u\| \geq l^{-1} e^{\chi k} \| e^s\| - l e^{- \chi k} \| e^u\| , $$ which is clearly incompatible with the earlier estimate when $k$ is sufficiently large. We conclude $\|e^s\| = 0$, i.e., $E = E^u(x)$. 

No. With $n = r = 2$, set $$X = \bigg(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \bigg) \, , \quad V = \bigg( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \bigg) \, .$$ In particular, $X^T V = V^T X = 0$, the zero matrix. If you restrict to invertible square matrices, the statement is still false. Set $$X = \bigg(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \epsilon \end{array} \bigg) \, , \quad V = \bigg( \begin{array}{cc} \epsilon & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \bigg) \, .$$ Then $X^T V = V^T X = \epsilon \operatorname{Id}$ and $\operatorname{Tr}(X^T V) = 2 \epsilon$. So, your LHS is $$ 2 \| \epsilon \operatorname{Id}\|_F^2 + (\operatorname{Tr}(\epsilon \operatorname{Id}))^2 = 8 \epsilon^2 \, , $$ which can be made arbitrarily small, while your RHS is $$ c \| X \|_F^2 \| V \|_F^2 = c (1 + \epsilon^2)^2 \geq c $$ The moral of the story is that the matrix norm is submultiplicative (not the Frobenius norm as above, but bear with me) in the sense that $\| X V \|$ can be arbitrarily smaller than $\| X \| \| V \|$. In the end, your constant $c$ depends either on how $X, V$ map each others singular value spaces to each other, or on some lower bound on the lowest singular value for either $X$ or $V$. 

The answer is Yes, provided that for every $\alpha$ and every $x\in G$, $f_\alpha(x^{-1})=f_\alpha(x)$. Since we already completed the construction of the Haar measure we can actually use it in our proof. I suppose that one can show this also elementarily, but why bother? Choose a left Haar measure on $G$. Let me assume, as the expression in consideration is homogeneous, that the $L^1(G)$ norm of all $f_\alpha,\phi$ is 1. The answer will follow from the claims $\lim[\phi,f_\alpha]=1$ and $\lim(\phi,f_\alpha)= 1$. I will prove the first claim, the second being similar. Let me first note that for every $\alpha$, $\phi(x)\leq \sum c_jf_\alpha(s_jx)$ implies by taking integrals that $1\leq \sum c_j$. Therefore $[\phi,f_\alpha]\geq 1$. We are left to show that for every $m>1$ there exists $\alpha_0$ such that for every $\alpha\geq \alpha_0$, $[\phi,f_\alpha] \leq m$. Fix $m>1$. Choose a compactly supported $[0,1]$-valued continuous function $\psi$ which is 1 on the support of $\phi$. Denote $\epsilon=(m-1)/\|\psi\|_1$. Set $\phi'=\phi+\epsilon \psi$ and note that $\|\phi'\|_1=m$. Note that the net $(f_\alpha)$ forms an approximate identity and therefore $\phi'*f_\alpha \to \phi'$ in the sup norm. See e.g: Folland, "A course in Abstract Harmonic Analysis" (2.42) - this is why I needed the assumption $f_\alpha(x^{-1})=f_\alpha(x)$. Find $\alpha_0$ such that for every $\alpha\geq \alpha_0$, $\|\phi'*f_\alpha- \phi'\|_\infty <\epsilon/2$. We now fix $\alpha\geq\alpha_0$ and denote for convenience $f=f_\alpha$. We are left to show that $[\phi,f]\leq m$. Let $K$ be the support of $\phi'$ and $K'$ be the support of $\phi'*f$. Let $Q$ be the convex set of positive measures on $G$ with total mass $m$ and support contained in $K$ and let $Q'$ be the set of finitely supported measures in $Q$. Identify $Q$ with a subset of $C(K)^*$ and note that $Q'$ is weak* dense in $Q$. Observe that $Q*f$ is a subset of $C(K')$. I claim that $Q'*f$ is weakly dense in $Q'*f$ within $C(K')$. Assume not. Then there exists $\nu\in Q$ such that $\nu*f$ is not in the weak closure of $Q'*f$. Find a (signed) measure $\lambda$ which separates $\nu* f$ from $Q'*f$ in $C(K')$ and observe that the continuous function $\lambda*\check{f}|_K$ separates $\nu$ from $Q'$ in $C(K)^*$. But this is absurd, as $Q'$ is weak*-dense in $Q$. This proves the claim. Recall that for convex sets the weak closure is the same as the norm closure. We deduce that $Q'*f$ is dense in $Q*f$ wrt the sup norm of $C(K')$. Observe that $\phi'\in Q$. Thus $\phi'*f\in Q*f$ and there exists a finitely supported measure $\mu\in Q'$ such that $\|\mu*f-\phi'*f\|_\infty<\epsilon/2$. It follows that $\|\mu*f-\phi'\|_\infty<\epsilon$. Since $\phi'-\phi=\epsilon\psi$ equals $\epsilon$ on the support of $\phi'$ and $\mu*f\geq 0$ everywhere we get that $\mu*f\geq \phi$ everywhere. Writing $\mu=\sum_{j=1}^n c_j\delta_{s_j}$ we get that for every $x\in G$, $\sum c_jf_\alpha(s_jx) \geq \phi(x)$. Thus $[\phi,f]\leq \sum c_j=m$. 

Let me try to put some things in order here. For a topological space $X$ we denote here by $2^X$ the set of all continuous functions $X\to \{0,1\}$. Fixing a set $S$ we consider the set $2^{\beta S}$ where $\beta S$ denotes the Stone–Čech compactification of $S$. For $A,B\subset \beta S$ let me write $$U(A,B)=\{f : f|_A=0,~f|_B=1\} \subset 2^{\beta S}.$$ We consider here three topologies on the same space $2^{\beta S}$. These given as follows: 1) The compact-open topology, which basis is given by the sets $U(A,B)$ where $A,B\subset \beta S$ are compact. 2) The product topology, which basis is given by the sets $U(A,B)$ where $A,B\subset \beta S$ are finite. 3) The $2^S$ topology, which basis is given by the sets $U(A,B)$ where $A,B\subset S\subset \beta S$ are finite. Let me note that (1) is a natural topology on a space of continuous functions, (2) is a natural topology on a subspace of the set of all maps $\beta S\to\{0,1\}$ and (3) is the pull back of the natural topology on $2^S$ under the (bijective) restriction map $2^{\beta S}\to 2^S$. So these are all reasonable. The question seems to be about the comparison of these topologies. It is clear from the above description that $(3) \leq (2) \leq (1)$. If $S$ is finite than they are all the same. Let me assume from now on that $S$ is infinite. I claim that $(3)\lneq (2) \lneq (1)$. To see the inequalities, note that for $x\in \beta S-S$ the function $f\mapsto f(x)$ is (2)-continuous but not (3) continuous and that the set of functions which are supported on $S$ is (1) open but not (2) open. Note that (3) is Hausdorff and compact by Tychonoff, so it also follows that (2) and (1) are not compact, otherwise the corresponding identity map would be a homeomorphism. 

The classical Besicovitch covering lemma (BCL) asserts that for any $d \geq 1$, there is a constant $N(d)$ with the following property. If $A \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is any subset and $r : A \to (0,R]$ is a (bounded) function ($R < \infty$ is fixed), then there are (at most) countably many points $\{a_j\}_j$ such that $\{B(a_j, r(a_j))\}_j$ is a cover of $A$ with multiplicity at most $N(d)$ (i.e. for any $j$, $B(a_j, r_j)$ has nonempty intersection with at most $N(d) - 1$ balls $B(a_k, r_k)$, $k \neq j$). I should underscore the fact that the the multiplicity $N(d)$ depends only on $d$ and on none of: the 'ball size function' $r$, the bound $R$, or the set $A$. I am interested in a generalization of this fact to manifolds, replacing $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a (finite dimensional, smooth, Riemannian) manifold $M$ and Euclidean balls with geodesic balls. Unfortunately, it seems that the BCL is generally false in this setting, due to a result of Chi: indeed, according to that paper, if the BCL holds on a Hadamard manifold (i.e. everywhere nonpositive sectional curvature), then that manifold is $\mathbb{R}^d$ for some $d$. So, one must compromise to obtain a positive result. I think that it suffices to constrain the maximum ball size $R$: given a manifold $M$, the BCL holds for ball size functions $r \leq R$, where $R$ depends on $M$. For e.g., one can apply the Nash embedding theorem and the classical BCL, and this implies the following: for any compact $M$, there is are numbers $N = N(M)$ and $R = R(M) > 0$ such that for any $A \subset M$ and any $r : A \to (0,R]$, there is an at-most countable cover $B(a_j, r(a_j)$ of $A$ by geodesic balls with multiplicity $\leq N$. Question: Is there any way to tell what $R$ should be by looking at only local features of the manifold? The constraint $R$ comes from how 'folded up' the Nash/Whitney embedding is in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and I have no clue how to control it. So, this result is highly unsatisfying: for small enough $R$, the BCL is a local result (isn't it?), and so the multiplicity shouldn't have anything at all to do with the global 'folding up' of an embedding in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Instead, I suspect that one ought to be able to cook up a constraint on $R$ that depends only on some local feature, like the sectional or Ricci curvatures. Has anyone done this or know of prior work in this direction? 

As you can see, the proof heavily depends on the uniformity of the hyperbolicity estimates across $\Lambda_{\chi, l}$, which are often called uniformity sets or Pesin sets in the literature. One expects continuity of $E^{u/s}$ to hold only along Pesin sets, and not along the whole set of Lyapunov regular points. Generally, only Holder continuity holds-- my favorite proof is given in Brin & Stuck (Chapter 5, I think). Uniform continuity across Pesin sets can be recovered by modifying the above proof.
