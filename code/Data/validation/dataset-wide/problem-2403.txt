The intuitive or quick learner (ugghatitañña) The intellectual (vipañcitañña) The one who needs guidance (neyya) The rote learner (pada,parama) 

Looking at the references below this does not look like enlightenment but some other experience induced by a different kind of practice which is neither Samatha or Vipassana in the Theravada Buddhist sense. 

You start with self restraint. Initially this would be having a list of rules or code of conduct you try to adhere to. When your old habitual or reflexive responses try to manifest himself try to take a step back, compose yourself, see if the actions are in the list of acts you want to avoid if so avoid it. Also have a list of action you want to do as try to do it when you get the opportunity. As you go on see if the actions are for the good of oneself or that of others, or one's action are the way you want to treat others, then follow through accordingly and if not abstain from such action. [Velu,dvāreyya Sutta, Sedaka Sutta] Finally as your wisdom increases see if the metal states and content (Refer to Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma by Bhikkhu Bodhi and Kīta,giri Sutta section on feelings) are favorable and then follow through if the actions are conducive. 

You should start by being mindful on when you perceive something as a threat, friendly and neither. Look at the associated sensation that arise with such perceiving. Best is to do a course on meditation. You can try: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

To get into Samadhi you need to develop the Jhana factors. Suppressing the 5 Hindrances does provide conducive ground for Jhanas factors also to develop. Jhana is result of developing the Jhana factor and suppression of the respective hindrance. So the fastest way for this is the most suitable Kammaṭṭhāna to develop the Jhana factors. Since the Buddha is not there finding this is a trial and error process. Also there are some subjects which are more suitable for certain type of people. Jhana factors displace the Hindrances also, but displacing Hindrances alone does not lead to Jhana unless Jhana factor arises. As iterated before suppressing the hindrances give fertile ground for the Jhana factors to arise. Also might be of interest: Mettā Bhāvanā Sutta, (Aṭṭha) Mettânisansa Sutta 

I do not understand this part hence will leave it for someone else to fill in for this. See: Mind, the three words by Piya Tan, 2 paragraphs from the end of page 1 onwards. What is discussed here to attachment to politics, religion etc. but this can be interpreted to attachment to my reasoning, my idea, my view, etc. 

For mental lethargy you can try the techniques to abandon sloth and torpor. To overcome physical lethargy you can do walking meditation with a quicker pace. 

There is no rebirth / reincarnation (in the sense that the soul takes on a new body after the death of the previous body. ) Our existence is changing process in which there are events like birth and death. In the absence of a unchanging everlasting core the person who is born is not the same as the person who died nor is he a deferent person but but just the continuation of the process of existence. In Buddhism what is there is Jati / birth and death as events in the process keeping us in the cycle of Samsara. There is no continuity of the person (or some core identity / entity) but there is a continuation of the process. 

The Buddha mentioned that there were 8 past Karma which were effective even after becoming Buddha. See: Why the Buddha Suffered - Apadāna 39.10 

All this involve conceptualisation which can lead to delusional thoughts as with any mind constructed concept it is easy to lose sight of its true nature. This is called Vipallasa as discussed in Vipallasa Sutta. Sometimes you cannot avoid doing intellectual work like a puzzle or mathematical work. This is not ideal, but any kind of mental activity or when you cognize you experience some sensation. (Titth’ayatana Sutta, Dhātu Vibhaṅga Sutta, etc.) So if you are sensitive enough then perhaps you can try to look at the arising and passing of these sensations with equanimity. 

Any perception of notion of self will not match reality 100% hence will be unsatisfactory. Through meditation you should get rid of this perception of self as this is the source of misery. If you keep pondering of self or non self at an intellectual or philosophical level you still dealing with concepts and perceptions, so this is not something you should ponder on as it feeds into a particular perception or notion which results in misery. If you react with craving and attachment towards any sensation volitional formation will follow (Saṅkhāra). E.g. you have a perception of self and you hear a sound. You can perceive that some one is scolding me. To this you can react with anger and create volitional formation / Karma. If your perception of self is completely removed then you do not need to react through you know that some one is verbally abusing you but you do not take it personally. Any perception will give you a yard stick to measure the disparity from reality since the 3 universal characteristics means any perception will never be right 100%. In you mind's eye there should be no or notion of self as this will not enable you to look at the world in a detached way without taking things personally. Just my brief 2C to complement couple of already very good answers. 

Certain beliefs arise thought logical or imaginative thinking or attractiveness of a teaching or what has been imagined. Many wrong beliefs stem from imagination. But finally what you should believe is what you can verify at the experiential level. 

There are 37 factors (Bodhipakkhiyādhammā) you have to cultivate in balance to get to Nirvana. Out of which one (you can say the most important of them all) is Awareness. If you loose this you cannot cultivate the rest as it is the controller as well as the measuring instrument as to how much each factor has developed. Measurer - awareness will tell you which factors are imbalanced Controller - realising some factor is imbalanced you can start working on making it balanced 

This is discussed in Sal-āyatana Vibhanga Sutta, Indriya Bhāvanā Sutta. When you experience any of these sensations you should remain equanimous and aware of the arising and passing nature to eliminate the roots. See: Pahāna Sutta 

Nirvana is the fuel burning out which keeps the recreation of the 5 aggregates, more particularly the elimination of the cause or roots (greed, hatred, delusion, non greed, non hatred, non delusion). So this description of Nirvana as a place is wrong. Scientific theories are not eternal but in a flux of change unlike the Dhamma is a constant in any time period. So these theories of dimensionality cannot be related to Dhamma but can be perhaps treated as an approximation or an aid to understand at the conceptual level. 

Zen Sickness, by Zen Master Hakuin mentions one cause of it was access striving. In Buddhism you should pratice in a balanced manner. 

Depression is also a form of fabrication / conditioning. This manifests itself as sensations. (as an irresistible tingling sensation or some painful sensation around the head or forehead) But objectively looking at the sensation without reaction this will pass away. The source of the depression is clinging and aversion combined with the lack of knowledge of the 3 marks of existence. 

Yes and no. Concies does not on its own does nothing to dictate who we are. We are formed due to past conditioning. This is decided by whether we react to the feelings arising from contact with craving, aversion and ignorance. E.g. you touch a soft fabric and think I want this. This creates fabrications and becoming. 

Absolute realities fall into citta, cetasika, rupa, nibbana out of which the Rupa is elements or materiality. [See: The Abhidhamma in Practice by N.K.G. Mendis] Nibbana is also sometimes considered an element. Everything which is conditioned is constructed by materiality or elements which are: 

In the simplest form illusion/delusion/ignorance is the misidentification off what is felt. You experience something and you think this is permanent. Another experience as self etc. Illusion/delusion/ignorance reinforced due to thought proliferation (papanca 1) which automatically give arise to ideas, view, etc. which automatically created more illusion/delusion/ignorance. (Main sutta discussing papanca is Madhu,piṇḍika Sutta) Superstition is in the form of attachment to views which is a result of thought proliferation. For an in depth treatment refer to: Mindfulness in Early Buddhism, by Tse-fu Kuan specially chapter 1, 2, 3 + conclusion. 1 Alternative essay PAPAÑCA by Leigh Brasington 

For monks it is permissible to have Chathu Madura after noon. I am not sure if the chocolate counts. The correct way to prepare it is in the attachment in the discussion. May be what you saw as Chocolate would have been Jaggery. Depending on the type it might have a chocolate like appearance. Any way if you meditate intensively looking at the hunger sensation or food craving it will pass away without the need to eat later. 

No worldly activity is entirely satisfying or entirely pleasurable. You seam to be realising that and directing your energy and prioritizing what matters like earnings your livelihood. I.e. you are loosing the will to chase after pleasure and thrills as you have realized that this is not entirely satisfactory. This is very normal I would think. 

In addition to @Sankha Kulathantille's answer. The Devaputra Mara is a being living in the Paranimmita Wasawarti realm. His appearance and actions are analogous to that of Cupid in Western literature. Since he lives in a sensual sphere he tries to get the others to be like him. It is some one who parties a lot tires to drag his friend in as well. (See: The Buddha's Encounters with Mara the Tempter) Moggallāna was one time a Mara Dusi (see: Māra Tajjaniya Sutta), but later liberated hin self as a monk and also becoming a chief disciple of the Buddha, in a later life. 

Sensation are the mind conditioner. Buy using sensation to eliminate fabrication creation you calm your metal fabrication. Also this sensation can be used to calm your metal chattering. Generally your mind wonders away then there is an overwhelming sensation coming from a sense door. If the sensation are generally pleasant or neutral your mind does not stray from your meditation object. 

As per some masters in the Theravada tradition it is good to do 2 sessions a day. One in the morning and another in the evening. Ideally a minimum of 1 hour per session. 

I am looking for a proper translation of the Tikapatthana into English which might be available online as a PDF. Is it possible to point me to such reference. I am looking for the complete set. 

According to Buddhism there 31 planes of existance out of one which is the animal kingdom. Your next birth is decided by the last thought moment where you remeber a recent or grave act of Karma which you have performed. So what decides or separates us from animals the Karma which decided our birth. 

may help you develop more focus. Also your meditation is not entirely in your control, i.e. it is non self, hence having expectation will be counter productive. Also getting attached to these expectation can be more counterproductive and it will cause unsatisfactoriness with the meditation. So practice the meditation techniques to the best of your ability without expectation or attachment to the expectation. 

earth-element (solidity), appearing as hardness or softness fire-element (temperature), appearing as heat or cold wind-element, appearing as motion or pressure 

lean the Vinaya so you do not walk in blindly tame your senses in lay life so you can make your ordained life more productive and live according to the Vinaya 

Best is to take a course in meditation or seek guidance of a teacher. Following site has many centers arround the world where you can take a course: $URL$ There are other centers also. The way to keep your mind on any object is sustained application to start with until a point where you mind stays without this effort. E.g. when doing Anapana for each breath be mindful of the whole (start, middle and end) in and out breath and a small pause in between. At each phase make sure your mind is with the breath. At the end evaluate it if you mind wonders off at any point and also the nature of the breath. Do this until you do not need to make an effort to keep your mind on the object. There are other type of meditations you can do for concentration. They also follow the same method of sustained attention to start with and when you mind stays with the object drop the extra effort. There are centers which teach this also but you might have to go to a country which has a this type of center as there are only lesser number. 

If you are attached you do not make the right decision. You might make a decision out of fear or without taking all into account. The best if to use Bhavana / Vipassanā to reduce this attachments. 

Also you can look into magazine like: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ to get material. Also have a look at: $URL$ This is a blog which posts something new on Buddhism nearly every day. Also following are other sites like $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

The Buddha says this Dhamma is for the Intelligent (in your words high capacity people). This is people are balanced and developed in Bodhipakkhiyādhammā. 

What is the Buddhist perspective on how we store and recall memories of this life and beyond? Since there is not solid core (Atman) as in the Hindu perspective which all such memories are stored and all cognitive phenomena pass away and arise again, how does the transmission, persistence and recollection of memory work. How does this compare with modern perspectives of it? This question inspired by: The complexity of memory hence would like to see some comparison of some of the ideas in these talks being also discussed in the answer with regard to comparison with the modern perspectives. 

Anapana in the context of the one hour sessions should be practiced if your mind not not calm, i.e., : 

Having a child is a long term commitment, responsibility and attachment which comes part and parcel. Also raising a child can be a opportunity to do good as well in raising children the right way. (Putta darasa sangaho. “cherishing of wife and children”- Mangala Sutta) This attachment can perhaps in the long run result in generation negative karma, while the positive aspects can lead to positive karma. It is up to you to balance the two, hence this aspect of Karma you accumulate more. 

Anger result due to ignorance. Ignorance of when we make sense input our perception and views makes us react to our sense input. We see, hear or feel something which we do not like or something turns out to not what we expect, we react with anger. Hence when you get some sense input jest look at it as feeling. Bee mindful of the feeling it cause and just leave it at that without any reaction knowing that the feeling also will pass away. If the above does not work you could try doing some loving kindness meditation. 

I would hold the view that all Theravada Suttas were recorded in the 1st council. There was a split that happened in the 2nd council which resulted in schism which lead to Theravada and Mahayana. The Mahayana school did develop new Suttas but also preserved the old in the Agamas. Many scholars referring to figure out if a Sutta is early or later compares these Theravada and Agama source this are very similar but having disimilarities also. If they tally they rationalize this is an early source. If there is any addition they consider this perhaps a later composition. I would personally believe if something is missing in the Agamas this would have been transmission error as the Mahayana school was not as metriculers as to preserving wording as the Theravada tradition. (Since there are many later additions in the Mahayana school.) Also Mahayana texts were translations whereas Pali language was close to or same as Magahi which was spoken by the Buddha himself. So here also discrepancies could have arose. After the 3rd council the likelihood of changes to the Theravada Tripitaka would have been very small as Buddhism spread to to multiple location which survived in countries like Burma. If there would have been discrepancies then the version in the countries would diverge. In the 4th council the Tripitaka was put in writing. This would have eliminated any room to discrepancies as this was also not confined to one country. Any changes would lead to discrepancies. The Theravada councils were more heard to collect compare all the sources and redistribute the aggregate source than new compositions. Also in the case of the Bahudhātuka-sutta certain parts were missing in the chinese version which prompted to ascertain than this is a later composition by the Theravada school which would resonate well with modern through with equal rights to women. I feel this seams like biases in the research there the research was bent to fit modern thought and outlook. Sometimes it might be personal perceptions backed by evidence and logic to rationalize. Also taking the intersection than the union may not be the way to go in my opinion as Satipatthana Mula by Piya Tan this would leave out some aspects of the Sutta which does make practical sense. Also note certain areas in this analysis does have common areas from more than one independent school which indicate certain parts may have been lost than composed. At least in the Theravada school miss attributing anything to the Buddha or changing the words would have been very much feared hence would have been preserved well. Among the current editions the discrepancies are very rare, but there are some discrepancies. One example is Pacalā Sutta. Ultimately what is the Dhamma and what is not should be settled not at intellectual speculation but at experiential level and practice wherever possible, though some insights may not arise in every one. Any discrepancies regarding the practice should be verified by the practice.
