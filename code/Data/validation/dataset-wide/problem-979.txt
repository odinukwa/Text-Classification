The electromagnetic field is modeled as a dipole, but in actuality has ~10% component that is off the dipole. The wandering of this dipole (and by consequence, off dipole) magnetic field causes a shear in opposite directions at the inner and outer core. This inner and outer core shear scales similarly at the edges (at the inner core outer boundary and at the core mantle boundary) but in opposite directions (so they are of the same magnitude). This torque, causes the flow of the inner core and the outer core to spin in opposite directions, as shown by the last figure. 

This is a good question, but it really has a simple answer. How can you determine the depth of an object when you are not even calculating it? Triangulation uses circles, 2-D shapes, so when finding the solution to the equations of circles that solve all 3 circles, you only find X and Y. Z isn't even being solved for. Triangulation is not precise. In practice, we end up using much more than 3 stations and statistical methods to find the precise epicenter (and other methods to find the focus). 

I've seen models in astronomy that show how the Earth-Moon system must have come together after a collision. However, I have not heard whether there is any actual physical evidence on Earth that points to a prior collision. Is there geological (or other physical) evidence here on Earth that confirms the moon originated from a collision on Earth? If so what is that evidence? 

All the material that eventually formed our solar system is essentially recycled star dust. All iron on Earth was produced by large stars that existed before our Sun formed: the iron was created during nuclear fusion and later released when the parent star(s) exploded, presumably supernova. After our solar nebula had formed and material had been gravitationally compacted, dense elements like iron did not get far from the center of the nebula before "precipitating" out into planets and meteors. Thus the inner solar system has a high abundance of iron. This is in contrast to low-density elements/molecules that were in general able to escape the center of the nebula and make it pretty far before being pulled into a large mass. So we have high iron planets and meteors close to the sun (relatively speaking), and very little iron in the "gas giants" part of the solar system. I would consider this to be material that is "already there" but certainly some iron has been added by meteors. 

This is a very good question. There a few main heat sources: Heat(and work) left over from the formation of the earth, work (potential energy) generated by dense iron sinking into the center of the earth and forming a core, and radioactive energy. Since the Thermal diffusivity of the materials that make up the earth is low, heat transport is very slow and thus the planet retains a significant amount of its heat. Another reason why the earth is so hot, is that mantle convection is a very inefficient way to transport said heat, and thus the earth loses energy very slowly. We know how hot the interior of the earth might be because of laboratory experiments, and also volcanic eruptions. How much energy(temperature) does it take to melt gabbro (mantle rock)? Interestingly enough, the earth is cooling. And the inner core / outer core boundary is a freezing front (meaning turning from a liquid outer core to a solid inner core). Though, it is a very hot freezing front. 

The short answer is that people do talk about it. It is commonly referred to as "land use change". In general, the carbon dioxide equivalent of the effects of land-use change is on the order of 10% of the total anthropogenic contribution to CO2 emissions. This may seem small, but it is important to realize that land-based plants are only a portion of the carbon dioxide sinks. You can see below an image from globalcarbonproject.org that shows the relationship. See here for full presentation. 

There is no evidence that Earth had a much greater axial tilt so long ago. To my knowledge, the evidence for changes in the axial tilt of the Earth is based on ocean sediment cores (see $URL$ ) and ice cores ( see $URL$ ). However, these only go back 100s of thousands of years. There is no record that I know of that could be used to assess the axial tilt of Earth 100s of millions of years ago. However, you could speculate that after the collision that Earth had that led to our moon, the axial tilt could have been much greater as a result. However, all records that I have seen show that the axial tilt fluctuates from 22.1 to 24.5 degrees. 

Yes. Earthquakes are Dangerous No. Because big earthquakes happen so infrequently (~300 years in Seattle's case) that one shouldn't really worry about it. Engineers design buildings to withstand large earthquakes. Of course there is the possibility of failure, but generally the US is very good about their infrastructure. Seattle is not like Oklahoma, where they are completely unprepared for earthquakes. I lived in Los Angeles in 18 years, and while my time there was during the Northridge 1994 earthquake, most of the damage was to the buildings (which were insured) and not to the people. Still there is some risk, but I think the risk of driving in Seattle is probably riskier than living in Seattle for 50 years of earthquakes. 

This is a complex article, let me know if there is anything I could explain better. I think I've got this right. 

NASA's Earth Observing System produces many maps of air quality and land-surface variables, from instruments like MODIS, AIRS, OMI, VIIRS, etc. Both NASA and the scientific community produce maps of the retrieved data on a daily basis, but there are often gaps (e.g. no data) for many locations because of clouds, satellite coverage, or other limitations. Daily retrievals are often averaged by month or season so that a complete global map (or sub-region) can be made and then presented to the public and put into publications. Some locations have very few retrievals available for a monthly average (e.g. if there is a predominant cloud mass that sticks around for a long time). So, researchers must choose some threshold where no data is reported. As a graduate student, I would report the average if I had at least 4 days in the month, which seemed reasonable to me at the time for some reason. However, the number of available data points for a monthly average fluctuates so much, that the minimum number of members in the monthly average that I chose affected my temporal trendlines. What's the minimum number of days needed for satellite-derived maps of monthly averages? I can't call 3 days of data a "monthly average" in good faith, but is 4 days enough? For the purposes of this question, assume there is only one possible data retrieval per day per geo-location. 

This is a good question, and the basic answer is earthquake seismology. To answer this question, lets accept a fact: Waves propagate through the least time pathway, and not the least distance path. This property of physics is known as Fermat's principle. When an Earthquake occurs, energy propagates similar to a ripple of water, and spreads. Each point on this ripple can be modeled as a ray, each following its least time path through the Earth. As these rays propagate, they reflect and refract off heterogeneities inside the earth. These reflections are important: we can detect these reflections using surface seismometers. Using multiple seismometers, and the location of the source (earthquake), we can calculate the "lag" between when the closest seismometer detects the earthquake and the others(further from the source). This lag time can be used as a proxy for the depth of the reflected wave's heterogeneity. Using how deep this reflection originates, we can then figure out the least time path of the wave in terms of actual distance. Velocity is just distance over time, even for seismic waves. So since we have the distance traveled by the wave, and the time the wave took to get to the receiver, we can complete the equation (distance/time). In actual practice, this process is far more complex, as you have to look for many different waveforms: The picture above illustrates an earthquake sending waveforms through the earth. The SKS wave is a shear wave that refracts into the liquid outer core, turns into a compressional wave (since shear waves cannot propagate through liquid), and then is converted again to a shear wave as it enters the mantle and goes to the surface. A trained seismologist looks at the readings from seismometers to tease out specific waves, which we know the properties of, to determine properties of the planet's interior. The speeds of these waves are highly dependent on the assumed densities and other rock properties of the crust, mantle, and core. 

How much total garbage is going into the Pacific Ocean every year? and what fraction of the garbage is "biodegradable". In this other article, they point out that the size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is much larger than previously thought. They go on to say that they are developing a technology that will clean up some of the garbage: 

The influence type of atmosphere could refer to a variety of things that affect soil properties such as: 

It's amazing how much water traveled down the slopes of California during the first two months of rain/flooding of 2017. Since the amount of water was far greater than anything in recent history, there were many landslides and widening of rivers. As part of that process, there was a lot of sediment that traveled downstream. Is there anyway to estimate how much sediment there was? If so, how can we calculate it? 

from $URL$ You see, these changes in the internal portions in the Earth's magnetic field cause a shear. The Earth's magnetic poles are not stationary, they wander. There is clear evidence of this from the paleomagnetic record. This is caused by the viscous convection of the iron nickel outer core. Their numerical models showed that the electromagnetic torque : from P.W. Livermore et al. 2013 On the outer core has a westward direction, while the inner core's torque scales accordingly in the opposite direction. 

will give you a scatter plot with Lat being the x, Lon being the y, and rain being the z. Also note that because your vectors are different legnths, you cannot plot them. You must have vectors of the same lenght to plot (each point must correspond to another point on the axis). Other types of plots will require you to interpolate between the data points. If you want to plot it like in the comment below: pcolor is your best choice. Say your Lat/Lon vectors have n points. Then to make an nxn grid, you can use the command 

An important aspect of this is location. Sea-level rise will not be exactly uniform across the globe and tides/storms will cause a lot of regional variability in terms of coastal change. Local governments should not necessarily be planning for an average global sea-level rise but instead develop a regional understanding of the coastal effects they will likely experience. For instance, see California's recent CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION SEA LEVEL RISE POLICY GUIDANCE here: $URL$ which says 

A rare meteorological event occurred that day. I offer a semi-empirical frame of reference that takes into account that the most extreme rainfall rates occur for a short duration (e.g. a few minutes). In "A methodology to classify extreme rainfall events in the western mediterranean area" by Casas et al., (2004): $URL$ they show rain rates of up to 0.5 cm/min sustained for several minutes (based on a large network of rain monitors in Barcelona). IF that could somehow be sustained for an hour, that would give a rate of 30 cm/hr (which is what Holt saw). For comparison, the most extreme rainfall rate measured in one minute in the USA is 3.1 cm (1.2 in; see $URL$ ). Actual rain doesn't continue at such an extreme rate for much longer, but would equate to 186 cm per hour (6 times what Holt, Missouri saw in 1946). The link that kwinkunks provides $URL$ shows a world rate record of 3.8 cm/min which, if sustained, would equate to 228 cm per hour. 

You ask what we should change to better predict earthquakes, and I'd think almost everything. As geophysicists we might know the what of earthquake detonation, but are relatively blind at the how. There is a strong group of scientists who feel that single event prediction is NOT a realistic goal, and may perhaps be impossible. Some good guesses as to why this is still a problem: 

To add to a already complete answer by kwinkunks, perhaps one of the most surprising things about plate tectonics to geophysicists was the fact that in some cases extension in the lithosphere (rifting) is a direct cause of subduction zones. When the idea of subduction zones was finally formalized (~1969) most geophysicists expected all subduction zones to be accompanied by an area of compression, but what is later found is that rifting centers opened up nearby. What studies further found is that the motion of the upper plate and the viscous coupling of the subducting plate caused the trench to roll backwards in the opposite direction of subudciton! This trench rollback opens ups an oceanic ridge, what we call back-arc spreading centers! So the whole point of this small digression is that plate tectonics is a very complex issue, and not all the forces are well understood. Models show that the mantle is convecting near plate margins at orders of magnitude greater than plate motion. Inside the mantle wedge of subduction zones we see rapid and complex mantle flows that react to plate geometry in unpredictable ways. Melting (lava/magama) certainly plays a apart in our plate motions, but we really have no idea how much it does. To be honest, if we did, a lot of geophysicists would be looking to do something else.
