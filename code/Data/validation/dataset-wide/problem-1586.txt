Other articles provide information on the transmission route for a variety of viruses. For instance, an article about the Norovirus says: 

What that article boils down to is this: You can be perfectly happy when you're poor as long as you aren't bombarded by expectations to have more material wealth. In a richer society, especially where material wealth is fluid, there is a greater risk of polarization between the rich and poor. Jean-Benoit G. Rouseau has written an excellent dissertation comparing income and well-being (pdf). That paper points out that it is possible to experience a net gain in income that results in a net loss of well-being. The following is an excerpt from the paper's conclusion: 

Dog Saliva: At least one study on sciencedirect.com suggests that canine saliva is "bactericidal against Escherichia coli and Streptococcus canis but only slightly". An article on ABC's 20/20 reports that a dog's mouth is not cleaner than a human's mouth and the rapid healing of wounds observed in dogs is due to the constant licking removing dead tissue and stimulating circulation. The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) lists a variety of infections that can be passed from dogs to humans, including: Campylobacter, Dipylidium, Giardia, Leptospira, Rabies, and Ringworm. Finally, a project submitted to the 2010 California State Science Fair comparing the antibacterial properties of dog saliva with Neosporin concludes that: 

I attended private schools from kindergarten through secondary school and was often told by the faculty that students who attended private schools got a better education, one that made them more prepared for college, than a public school education could provide. There are many issues that complicate a fair comparison between the two, including: 

Emil Maurice Maurice was a long-time friend of Hitler and was a member of the Nazi party before that party gained control of the German government. After being named the first supreme commander of the SA and after signing on as SS member number 2 (Hitler was member number 1) he was accused by Himmler of having Jewish ancestry. A law within the SS stated that all officers had to be able to prove racial purity back to 1750 and Maurice's great-grandfather, Charles Maurice Schwartzenberger (1805â€“1896), was Jewish. Himmler recommended that Maurice and all his brothers be expelled from the SS, but Hitler compelled Himmler to make an exception and allow them to stay as "Honorary Aryans." 

Not quoted, but presented in the paper, is a discussion on the physical differences in male and female brains. Language ability in male brains appears to be restricted mostly to the left hemisphere but is more developed in the right hemisphere in female brains. The author seems to imply that this allows males to use more of the right hemisphere for the visual-spatial skills that are required for hunting. Bottom-line: Yes, men tend to have better visual-spatial skills than women. 

Did Albert Einstein learn to drive, or obtain a driver's license, considering he stayed in the USA for a significant proportion of his career? 

While it is nearly impossible to carry out an experiment on whether hand sanitiser usage will cause the immune system to misfire/fail, there have indeed been peer-reviewed experiments carried out on the fact that significant reduction in exposure to infections/antigens (a likely result of overuse of hand sanitisers) may result in a hampered immune system, which may lead to autoimmune diseases. This is known as the hygiene hypothesis. Epidemiological data suggests that immigrants to relatively "clean" countries, such as Australia and the UK suffer from additional risk of autoimmune diseases. It has been suggested that living in a "clean" country increases the risk of developing autoimmune diseases, presumably due to the reduced exposure to microbes. 

The article hypothesises that the reason for the rice turning out the way it did was due to improperly controlled experiments carried out by Emoto. 

This WND news piece goes even further and claims that Mein Kampf is a standard Arab textbook. Are there any bestseller lists in Muslim countries that show that the book has become a bestseller in Muslim countries in the past 20 years? 

A number of recent articles (Daily Mail, Fox News, Hindustan Times) describe ice cream cones being sold in India which are labelled as "Hitler" distinctly on their boxes. 

Yes, DNA sequencing labs monitor sequences ordered for certain "sequences of concern". At least two gene synthesis companies claim to follow the U.S. governmental Screening Framework Guidance for Synthetic Double-stranded DNA Providers, which recommends that providers screen both customers and sequences, and that they ask additional questions if a potentially dangerous DNA sequence is ordered: 

There has been discussion on the Snopes forums regarding the second image. In the link, they discussed the case of Peanut the tortoise, which appears to be the same tortoise depicted in the first link. Therefore, at least the first image is authentic, and tortoises can certainly be deformed by plastic rings. According to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources quoting the Missouri Department of Conservation, the first photo is an authentic image. 

I recently saw this Reddit comment claiming that roosters are seen as gallant because they let their hens eat first: 

The story that Edison scammed Tesla out of his payment for services he was hired for is widely spread on the Internet. The story was featured on this The Oatmeal webcomic, which is excerpted below: 

However, this claim is unsourced, and this The Straight Dope article claims that there is no proof that this theory is correct. 

I have heard that it is possible to unlock a car using the remote key-fob over a cell phone network. Scenario: Adam locks his keys in his car. He uses his cell phone to call his wife, Betty, who is at home with a cell phone. Adam holds his cell phone close to the car while Betty holds the spare remote close to her cell phone and pushes the UNLOCK button. Will this unlock the car door? 

Finally, an article titled "Osteomyelitis Associated With Cat-Scratch Disease" from PediatricsConsultantLive.com concludes with this helpful tip: 

Edit (per Matthew Read's comment, here are some links): The Wikipedia entry for Influenza describes the method of transmission for that disease. It confirms that a person with influenza is contagious before they are symptomatic. The Wikipedia entry for Transmission (medicine) lists multiple routes of transmission for a variety of maladies, from HIV to athlete's foot. 

There is at least one proposal that Vikings sailed around the northern coast of Canada and made it as far south along the west to reach Vancouver Island. 

Have any scientific inquiries determined the real cause of these lights? Are there any credible photos or videos of the phenomenon? 

Edit II (per Borror0's comment): The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) offers a number of notices and other articles aimed at the general public and health care professionals. In an article on preventing the spread of the flu virus in child care settings, a brief explanation is given as to when an infected person can be considered contagious: 

Cat Saliva: FamilyDoctor.org explains that "Cat-scratch disease is an infection caused by a type of bacteria [...] called Bartonella henselae and can be passed from a cat to a human" through scratches, bites, or even by rubbing your eyes after petting a cat that has the bacteria on its fur. A research paper available from The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (jac.oxfordjournals.org) finds that... 

Conclusion: While dog saliva has been shown to be bactericidal against Escherichia coli and Streptococcus canis, it is only slightly so again two specific bacteria. No research was found supporting the hypothesis that cat saliva has any similar qualities. There is much more evidence that suggests that dog and cat saliva applied to an open wound can transmit more bacteria than it will kill. My advice: wash your hands thoroughly with soap after playing with your pets. 

Is there any research that shows that one type of education is better than another, while accounting for the various demographic differences between private and public schools? 

(Image comes from $URL$ and may have nothing to do with the 'real' moon illusion.) Donald E. Simanek has a very good article about the phenomenon on his website. The opinion presented in his article is that the true nature of the illusion is not completely understood. He presents a number of theories, debunking those that are wrong, and offering suggestions about the more plausible ones. For the time being, the whole true reason behind the phenomenon remains unresolved. 

Which sounds like the practice was banned. Does that mean Hitler wasn't participating? Who knows for sure - the guy who committed suicide before the Allies got to him in 1945. There is certainly evidence that occult practices were investigated for propagandic purposes. 

That same chart indicates that a pin drop from a height of 1cm at a distance of 1m is 15dB. However, that chart also has a gross misstatement about Krakatoa exploding in 1883 that it "CREATED A 3000 FOOT TIDAL WAVE" - at no point was the tsunami measured (above mean sea level) at higher than a couple hundred feet. They also reference an absurdly high ejection maximal distance (34 miles), when it was more along the lines of 17-20 (ref and here) (not that this is an indicator of other misinformation, but it's a warning). Also, to quote Wikipedia's Decibel article: 

Hitler had a personal astrologer by some claims (Karl Ernst Krafft - though that claim is disputed elsewhere). Also, he had an interest in Numerology - which may or may not be occultic. The source referenced by the previous link: 

According to LEGO, in 2003 they had hit the 4,000,000,000 minifigures-produced mark. They were introduced in 1978, and they've added thousands of variations over the years. Given that LEGO has produced >560,000,000,000 total items (or about 80 LEGO bricks/objects per human currently living), it seems highly reasonable to believe that they may hit ~8,000,000,000 minifigures by 2017-2019 (the XKCD reference calculates 2019). Of course, whether they will or not is another story. Also, counting those minifigures still in existence vs the total population of produced minifigs is more-or-less impossible to verify. 

Observationally, ADHD is generally diagnosed prior to any standardized tests being issued (at least in the educational world (again, from personal observation, those diagnoses are frequently made between 4 and 7 years old)). In most locales, standardized tests are not issued until grade 4, or approximately age 10. 

See also example of pressure. The bottom end of the range is in the neighborhood of 2x10-5 Pa, or about 2.9x10-9 psi. Based on the size of the ear drum alone, less than 1 cm in diameter, it must be extremely sensitive - there's not much place for it to move to start with. 

That is a velocity of nominally 1 km/s (3600 seconds in an hour), or about 3280 feet per second. There are several ammunition loads (available for both military and non-military purposes) which achieve velocities greater than this - as high as 5700 m/s (or 5.7 km/s). Achieving velocities higher than that which the SR-71 is confirmed to have achieved in flight is, therefore, possible. For larger objects, even excluding orbital vehicles, Wikipedia has a list of airspeed records, including a substantially higher speed attained by the X-15 (5500-6200 kmh). For non-US vehicles, you could look at the history of the Buran, too.
