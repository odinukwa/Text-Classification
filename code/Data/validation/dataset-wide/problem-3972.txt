UPDATE: the question has been changed to say that both $R$ and $G$ are finite, so I have modified my answer accordingly. Any maximal ideal in $R[G]$ contains the ideal $\text{Nil}(R)$ of nilpotent elements in $R$, and it is standard in this context that $R/\text{Nil}(R)$ is a finite product of finite fields, so we can assume that $R$ itself is a finite field, and of course these are well-understood. Given a maximal ideal $M<R[G]$, put $H_M=\ker(G\to(R[G]/M)^\times)$. Recall that any finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic, so the quotient $C_M=G/H_M$ is cyclic, of order $d$ say. Now $M$ corresponds to a maximal ideal in $$ R[C_M]\simeq R[u]/(u^d-1) = R[u]/\prod_{e|d}\varphi_e(u). $$ However, by construction $C_M$ embeds in $R[G]/M$, so $u^e-1$ cannot go to zero for any $e<d$, so we really have a maximal ideal in $R[u]/\varphi_d(u)$. As $\varphi_d(x)$ and $\varphi'_d(x)$ are coprime, the ring $R[u]/\varphi_d(u)$ is reduced, and so is a finite product of finite field extensions of $R$. 

Firstly, using the universal property of localisation we see that $[L_nS,L_nS]_*=\pi_*(L_nS)$ and similarly for $L_{K(n)}$, so we can just talk about the homotopy rings. Next, $\pi_*(L_1S)$ is closely related to the image of $J$ and is described completely in papers by Bousfield and Ravenel. There is a copy of $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}=\mathbb{Z}/p^\infty$ in degree $-2$, so the annihilators of powers of $p$ give a strictly increasing chain of ideals, proving that $\pi_*(L_1S)$ is not Noetherian. In $\pi_*(L_{K(1)}S)$ there is no $\mathbb{Z}/p^\infty$ but there are copies of $\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ for all finite $k$ so again the ring is not Noetherian. At height $2$ there are voluminous calculations by Shimomura and coauthors, and Behrens has recently explained an easier way to organise the answers, although they are still very complicated. The same line of argument shows that they are very far from being Noetherian. At larger heights I do not think that anything very significant is known. 

It might be useful here to think about the Morava $K$-theory rings $K(n)^*(BG)$ (for finite groups $G$). For the trivial group you get the graded ring $k=\mathbb{Z}/p[v_n,v_n^{-1}]$, where $|v_n|=2p^n-2$; for general groups you get a finitely generated graded module over $k$ (and all such modules are free). There is a ring structure, induction and restriction maps, an inner product and so on, making $K(n)^*(BG)$ closely analogous to $R(G)$. However, one can find examples where $K(n)^*(BG)$ has no basis that is permuted by $Aut(G)$, which means that we have nothing analogous to irreducible characters. One way to make your question more precise would be to restrict attention to methods that also work in this context. If you don't like the fact that $k$ has characteristic $p>0$, there are naturally occurring lifted versions where the trivial group gives you the ring of $p$-adic integers, or a formal power series ring over the $p$-adics or something a bit larger than that. If we let $E$ denote one of these variants, it works out that there is a kind of character theory due to Hopkins, Kuhn and Ravenel. Instead of conjugacy classes of elements of $G$, you need to consider the set $C_n$ of conjugacy classes of $n$-tuples of mutually commuting elements of $p$-power order. There is then a certain ring $L$ that is an algebraic extension of $\mathbb{Q}\otimes E^*(\text{point})$, and a natural isomorphism $L\otimes E^*(BG)\to Map(C_n,L)$, analogous to the description of $\mathbb{C}\otimes R(G)$ by class functions. 

I am teaching a course on knots for the first time, and this led me to play with an approach which I have not seen in the literature. I would be surprised if no one had used it before, so I am asking whether this approach has a name, and if there are any relevant references. The basic idea is like this. Let $\Lambda$ be the group freely generated by $\chi$ and $\rho$ subject to $\chi^2=\rho^4=1$. We will formulate everything in terms of finite sets with $\Lambda$-action. Let $U\subset\mathbb{R}^2\subset S^2$ be a link universe, i.e. a planar projection of a link, without any information about undercrossings or overcrossings (for the moment). Suppose for simplicity that there are no isolated circles. Let $A$ be the collection of pairs consisting of an arc in the diagram, together with a choice of direction for that arc. Define $\chi(a)$ to be the same arc with the opposite direction. Define $\rho(a)$ to be the arc obtained by "rotating $a$ through a quarter turn anticlockwise around the starting point", in an evident sense. This gives a $\Lambda$-action on $A$, and many of the standard things can be formulated in terms of this. The following three facts are enough to show that the combinatorial structure arises from a diagram in $S^2$: 

It seems experimentally that \begin{align*} f_{ss} &= 1 & \text{ for } s \geq 0 \\ f_{s,s+1} &= s-1 & \text{ for } s \geq 1 \\ f_{s,s+2} &= \left(\begin{array}{c}s-1\\2\end{array}\right) & \text{ for } s \geq 1 \\ f_{s,s+3} &= \left(\begin{array}{c}s-2\\1\end{array}\right) + \left(\begin{array}{c}s-2\\2\end{array}\right) + \left(\begin{array}{c}s-2\\3\end{array}\right) & \text{ for } s \geq 2. \end{align*} There does not seem to be a similarly tidy expression for $f_{s,s+4}$. 

Put $a=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 0&-1\\\\1&0\end{array}\right]$ and $b=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 0&-1\\\\1&-1\end{array}\right]$. I think it is known that the group $PSL_2(\mathbb{Z})=SL_2(\mathbb{Z})/\{I,-I\}$ is freely generated by $a$ and $b$ subject only to $a^2=b^3=1$. Probably most very long words in $a$ and $b$ will also need a long list of elementary matrices to represent them. 

In any category, we can say that a biretraction between objects $X$ and $Y$ is a system of maps $(f,g,f',g')$ with $gf=1_X$ and $f'g'=1_Y$, and we can say that two objects are biretractible if there is a biretraction between them. Biretractions can be composed and reversed in an obvious way, so biretractibility is an equivalence relation. We say that a biretraction "is an isomorphism" if $f$, $g$, $f'$ and $g'$ are isomorphisms, or equivalently $fg=1_Y$ and $g'f'=1_X$. In any category with good finiteness properties, it will work out that every biretraction is an isomorphism. For example, in the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field this follows easily from consideration of dimensions, and a slightly harder argument gives the same conclusion for finitely generated modules over a Noetherian ring. (A standard lemma shows that any surjective endomorphism of such a module is an isomorphism.) Now consider the homotopy category of those simply connected CW complexes $X$ for which all homology groups $H_k(X)$ are finitely generated. Any biretraction in this category will give a biretraction of homology groups, which will necessarily be an isomorphism, so the original biretraction is an isomorphism by Whitehead's theorem. Thus, biretractibility is the same as homotopy equivalence in this context, and many similar contexts. Of course, Karol's example has no good finiteness properties and so is not covered by this analysis. For a slightly different example, in the category of (possibly infinite) sets, a biretraction need not be an isomorphism, but nonetheless biretractible objects are isomorphic, by the Schröder–Bernstein theorem. 

I don't think that this is really true. There are very few cases where one can actually describe the full Postnikov system explicitly, so it is not widely used, except for certain very restricted classes of spaces. Next, in thinking about what is theoretically possible, you should remember the Kan-Thurston theorem. That says that for any connected space $X$ there is a group $G$ and a map $K(G,1)\to X$ that induces an isomorphism in homology. Here the space $K(G,1)$ has the simplest possible Postnikov tower, with only one layer and no $k$-invariants, but the homology can be anything you want, and does not depend in any very obvious way on $G$. 

There is some interesting stuff about this in Johnstone's book on Stone Spaces. In particular, he discusses what he calls "cartesian theories". Such a theory has a list of axioms, and if axiom $n$ says that there exists $x$ with property $P$, then axioms $1$ to $n-1$ imply that that $x$ is unique. He has some examples where natural non-cartesian theories are equivalent to less obvious cartesian theories, and other examples where this is not possible. It is familiar that purely equational theories can be interpreted in any category with finite products. I think it works out that cartesian theories can be interpreted in any category with finite limits. It is also interesting to look at software systems like Isabelle, Coq and Agda that can check suitably formalised proofs. I am most familiar with Agda, which has strongly constructive foundations. In Agda it is difficult and unnatural to formulate a bare existence statement; you could say that existential quantifiers are skolemized by default. 

Here are some things that one can say for more general ring spectra. I choose to work with even periodic spectra, where $\pi_1(E)=0$ and $\pi_2(E)$ contains an invertible element, so that one can generally concentrate on $E_0(X)$ and $E^0(X)$. Key examples are $E=KU$ and $E=HP=\bigvee_{i\in\mathbb{Z}}\Sigma^{2i}H$ and $$ E=MP=\bigvee_{i\in\mathbb{Z}}\Sigma^{2i}MU=\text{ the Thom spectrum for } \mathbb{Z}\times BU. $$ (Here $H$ will be the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum for mod $p$ (co)homology, for some fixed prime $p$.) Stable operations $F^0(X)\to E^0(X)$ are controlled by $E^0F$, which in good cases is the $E_0$-linear dual of $E_0F$. This is most naturally described in terms of the scheme $\text{spec}(E_0F)$. Associated to $E$ we have a base scheme $S_E=\text{spec}(E_0)$ and a formal scheme $G_E=\text{spf}(E^0BS^1)$ which should be thought of as a bundle of groups over $S_E$. We have similar data for $F$, using which we construct the scheme $\text{Iso}(G_E,G_F)$ consisting of triples $(a,b,u)$ with $a\in S_E$ and $b\in S_F$ and $u$ an isomorphism between the corresponding fibres of $G_E$ and $G_F$. There is a natural map $\text{spec}(E_0F)\to\text{Iso}(G_E,G_F)$ which is an isomorphism when one of $E$ and $F$ is Landweber exact. In the case $E=F=HP$ we find that $\text{Iso}(G_E,G_F)$ is the polynomial part of the dual Steenrod algebra, but this picture loses the exterior part. Unstable operation $F^0(X)\to E^0(X)$ (for spaces $X$) are controlled by $E^0(\Omega^\infty F)$. This has a natural Hopf algebra structure, and the additive unstable operations are the primitive elements. In good cases $E^0(\Omega^\infty F)$ is dual to $E_0(\Omega^\infty F)$, and the primitive elements are dual to the indecomposables in $E_0(\Omega^\infty F)$. Here $\Omega^\infty F$ is a ring up to homotopy, and the two ring operations give rise to two different products on $E_0(\Omega^\infty F)$. We take indecomposables with respect to the addition product, and the multiplication product passes to the quotient to give a ring structure on $\text{Ind}(E_0(\Omega^\infty F))$. This is again best described in terms of schemes. We can define $\text{Hom}(G_E,G_F)$ in the same style as $\text{Iso}(G_E,G_F)$ and we get a map $$\text{spec}(\text{Ind}(E_0(\Omega^\infty F))) \to \text{Hom}(G_E,G_F) $$ which is an isomorphism when $F$ is Landweber exact. The stabilization map $\Sigma^\infty\Omega^\infty F\to F$ gives rise to a map $\text{spec}(E_0F)\to\text{spec}(\text{Ind}(E_0\Omega^\infty F))$ which is compatible with the inclusion $\text{Iso}(G_E,G_F)\to\text{Hom}(G_E,G_F)$. In the case $E=F=HP$ this picture again sees the polynomial part of the cohomology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, but not the exterior part. Now let $\text{Sub}(G_E)$ denote the scheme of pairs $(a,A)$ where $a\in S_E$ and $A$ is a finite flat subgroup scheme of $(G_E)_a$. Put $DS^0=\bigvee_nB\Sigma_n$. The group $E^0DS^0$ can be made into a ring using the transfer maps associated to the inclusions $\Sigma_i\times\Sigma_j\to\Sigma_{i+j}$. There is a natural map $\text{spf}(\text{Ind}(E^0DS^0))\to\text{Sub}(G)$, which is an isomorphism in good cases. In the case $E=HP/p$ this encodes the standard relationship between $H^*(B\Sigma_{p^d})$ and the Dickson invariant subalgebra of $H^*(BC_p^d)$, again ignoring the exterior parts. (The indecomposables are zero in $H^*(B\Sigma_m)$ if $m$ is not a power of $p$.) If $E$ is an $H_\infty$ ring spectrum, we have the following picture. For each point $(a,A)\in\text{Sub}(G_E)$ there is a naturally associated point $b\in S_E$ and an isogeny $q_A\colon(G_E)_a\to(G_E)_b$ with kernel $A$. This creates a relationship between power operations and a particular subclass of isogenies. Stable operations give an action of all isomorphisms, and one can combine this with the action of special isogenies to get an action of all isogenies, but this is slightly artificial. Going back to the case of $HP$, the stories with stable operations, unstable operations and power operations for $\Sigma_{p^d}$ give coaction maps \begin{align*} HP^0(X) &\to HP^0(X)[\zeta_0,\zeta_1,\zeta_2,\dotsc][\zeta_0^{-1}] \\ HP^0(X) &\to HP^0(X)[\zeta_0,\zeta_1,\zeta_2,\dotsc] \\ HP^0(X) &\to HP^0(X)[\zeta_0,\zeta_1,\zeta_2,\dotsc,\zeta_d]/(1-\zeta_d) \end{align*} These are all compatible in an obvious way. Indeed, because $G_E=\text{spf}(E^0BS^1)$ the claim is true by construction when $X=BS^1$. The class $\mathcal{X}$ of spaces where it is true is closed under products and coproducts. Moreover, if $f:X\to Y$ induces a surjection in cohomology, and $Y\in\mathcal{X}$, then $X\in\mathcal{X}$. In the case $E=HP$ we can now use the relationship between $BS^1$, $BC_p=K(\mathbb{Z}/p,1)$ and $K(\mathbb{Z}/p,n)$ to deduce that all spaces lie in $\mathcal{X}$. If $E$ is Landweber exact then one can make a similar argument using the spaces in the $MU$ spectrum instead of $K(\mathbb{Z},n)$. 

If we consider $y^p$ as an element of $RB$, then it is equal to $x^{p+1}$ and so lies in $RA\cap IA^{p+1}$. However, the corresponding element of $RB$ does not lie in $IB^{p+1}$, so $\tilde{f}(RB\cap IB^{p+1})\neq RA\cap IA^{p+1}$. 

Here are some comments about how this calculation can be organised. First, let $T(n)$ be the standard maximal torus in $U(n)$, and let $N(n)$ be its normaliser, so $W(n)=N(n)/T(n)$ is the symmetric group. Put $F(n)=U(n)/T(n)$ and $E(n)=F(n)/W(n)=U(n)/N(n)$, so we are interested in the (co)homology of $E(n)$. We know that $H^*(E(n);\mathbb{Q})=\mathbb{Q}$. I think it will be best to study $H_*(E(n);\mathbb{Z}/p)$ (where $p$ is prime) and recover information about $H^*(E(n);\mathbb{Z})$ at the end, using the universal coefficient theorems. From now on I'll write $H_*(X)$ for $H_*(X;\mathbb{Z}/p)$. It will also be best to study all the groups $H_*(E(n))$ together as a bigraded object $H_*(E(*))$. Note that there are sum and tensor product operations $\oplus\colon U(n)\times U(m)\to U(n+m)$ and $\otimes\colon U(n)\times U(m)\to U(nm)$. These are group homomorphisms, so they induce maps $BU(n)\times BU(m)\to BU(n+m)$ and $BU(n)\times BU(m)\to BU(nm)$. They preserve monomial matrices, so they give maps $BN(n)\times BN(m)\to BN(n+m)$ and $BN(n)\times BN(m)\to BN(nm)$. We can regard $E(n)$ as the fibre of the map $BN(n)\to BU(n)$, so we also get maps $E(n)\times E(m)\to E(n+m)$ and $E(n)\times E(m)\to E(nm)$. This will give two different products on the object $H_*(E(*))$, which will make it into a Hopf ring. Also, using block matrices we get a standard inclusion $\Sigma_n\wr U(m)^n\to U(nm)$. This gives an action of an $E_\infty$ operad on $BU(*)$ and $BN(*)$ and $E(*)$, and so gives Dyer-Lashof operations on the corresponding homology groups. Now $BN(*)$ is essentially the free $E_\infty$ space generated by $BN(1)=\mathbb{C}P^\infty$, which implies that $H_*(BN(*))$ is the free commutative algebra with Dyer-Lashof operations generated by $H_*(\mathbb{C}P^\infty)$. On the other hand, $H_*(BU(*))$ is just the free commutative algebra generated by $H_*(\mathbb{C}P^\infty)$. This implies that the map $H_*(BN(*))\to H_*(BU(*))$ is surjective (which can also be seen using the Becker-Gottlieb transfer map). Note also that the Dyer-Lashof operations in $H_*(BU(*))$ were worked out by Priddy. It seems likely that $H_*(E(*))$ is just the kernel (in the Hopf algebra sense) of the map $H_*(BN(*))\to H_*(BU(*))$. Some care is needed here because the relevant Hopf algebras do not have antipodes; they correspond to commutative monoids (rather than groups) in the category of coalgebras. Anyway, the message is that we expect that $H_*(E(*))$ will have structure closely related to that of the Dyer-Lashof algebra, and of similar size and complexity. So far we have not used the tensor product maps $U(n)\times U(m)\to U(nm)$, or equivalently, the second product in the Hopf ring structure. It is a theorem of Paul Turner that when $p=2$, the object $H_*(BW(*))$ has a simple presentation as a Hopf ring, which is in some ways more tractable than the presentation using Dyer-Lashof operations. I expect that there is a similar story for $H_*(BN(*))$, although I do not know whether that has ever been written down. It is also straightforward to write down the Hopf ring structure on $H_*(BU(*))$, and this may well give a nice description of $H_*(E(*))$. I am not sure whether a similar approach would work for $p>2$. 

Put $$U(n,k)=\{(x_1,\dotsc,x_k)\in F(\mathbb{R}^{n+1},k): \sum_ix_i=0 \text{ and } \max(\|x_1\|,\dotsc,\|x_k\|)=1\},$$ and $V(n,k)=U(n,k)/\Sigma_k\subset B(\mathbb{R}^{n+1},k)$. Then $V(n,k)$ is a strong deformation retract of $B(\mathbb{R}^{n+1},k)$, and there is an obvious inclusion $i\:B(S^n,k)\to V(n,k)$ which is a homeomorphism for $k=2$ but not for $k>2$. I don't think that you can say much more than that. Already there is a big difference when $n=1$ and $k>2$.
