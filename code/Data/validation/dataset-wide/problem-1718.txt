The hypervisors have 5 VMs in the cluster basically running as a RDS setup. The setup is pretty new. There are 4 1GB network cards in each hypervisor using nic teaming to make one 4GB connection for the VM usage / iscsi hosting of the VMS. In the past week both servers at one time or another have dropped out of the cluster and gone offline, the cluster resumes on the other server but I would really like to know why it's going offline. What happens is it just doesn't seem to be able to connect to the network in any way, the network settings are there but it cant' ping anything (internal or external), it can't tracert, can't see any other device on the network. I've tried disabling and re-enabling the nic team and the virtual Ethernet device but it doesn't come back online, the only way I can get the network restarted is to reboot the server. But i can't for the life of me work out why it's happening 

We have two dedicated servers across two different sites. They host hyper v virtual machines for email hosting etc. I'd like to have hyper v do replication between them and so I have a copy elsewhere, if something goes wrong re-route traffic to the other server (that side of it, i.e. the ip re route is all setup) However, the problem is how do I get the active directories talking to each other. Site to site vpn is out of the question I belive as I cannot add hardware either side to do the connection. I'm not sure software VPN will suffice here? The setup: Hypervisor 01 - Windows server datacentre 2012 

Not sure if I understand the question but you wont be able to have high availabilty of your virtual machines running on a host system. If you're already running an OS, then you need to add on a virtual machine service to windows. this would include: - virtualbox (free) - vmware server (free but being discontinued) - vmware player (free) - vmware workstation (paid) You can run VMs on each desktop, however you WILL notice a slowdown of the host system even if the VM isnt doing anything. CPU is only one concern - HD activity, network activity, ram, and most endusers will notice if you "sneak" a vm onto their workstation. If you're looking for high availability - to move vm around from machine to machine seamlessly - you're looking at commercial software from vmare/xen/microsoft. Using existing workstations is a bad idea as it will be slow and hassle to admin. What you're asking about isnt done in the real world. If you're wanting to play sure go for it, but if this is for a business/school/nonpersonal network it's bad idea to try to harness the "spare" cpu power, cannot stress that enough. It doesnt scale. 

In general, all stable gem releases should be there even if the project is hosted on Github or elsewhere. If you need to grab a different fork of it or a pre-release version, you may have to specify a different source, but in your case 0.1.0 looks like the current release version. Somehow your gem source is set to fetch from 

The broadest is on the far right (.com) and the left (www3.) most likely specifies a single host - very specific. IP addresses are opposite 

4 is the most specific part, indicating a single host. To fix this, the reverse lookup is done by checking 

The examples above, at least at the the time of this writing, are showing contradictory results. I assume you are changing host names and IP addresses to protect your identity? That is all fine, but makes it muy difficult to diagnose the problem. So, here is what I propose. Start by making sure your DNS records are set correctly. Verify your domain name is registered properly with the root servers and the .es domain root servers. This is shown in your first dig +trace result above. According to this, your dns servers are 

error. I'm using $URL$ url, which works fine and the authentication settings I'm trying (username / password) work fine in owa. Close to the point of pulling my hair out on this issue, is there a way to find out what it's failing on? Have I missed something very simple? Tom 

Got an odd situation I can't work out. HP Hypervisor running windows 2012r2 recently has started freezing the VMS. There are 4VMs on the hypervisor (all windows 2012r2). About once a week it seems the VMS all become unresponsive. They show as online in hyperv and the hypervisor stays responsive, however you can't get on the VMs using remote desktop OR connecting through hyperv manager. I can't see anything in the system/application event viewer that could point me in the right direction and i'm a bit stumped. Latest windows updates and drivers installed as far as I can tell. I need a bit of input on how to debug this 

Hypervisor 02 - Windows server datacentre 2012 Nothing running yet (I wish to add this to the hypervisor 01 active directory to use hyper v's built in replication options. i believe it requires the use of AD to keep everything in sync nicely. What do you guys recommend? Tom 

As AndrewB noticed and I missed, this looks like your problem. If you have an A record on tsohost name server pointing to your digital ocean server, you are telling it the final answer for its A record query is the digital ocean name server. DNS will not further query the digital ocean server - it has already gotten its answer. Instead, remove that A record from tsohost and tell it to delegate requests for the subdomain to your other name server. Do this by adding another origin and NS records delegating to your subdomain: 

Note that your dns server must also be registered as a DNS server specifically with GO DADDY or whoever your registrar is. How to for subdomain delegation 

Or the reversed, dotted quad notation plus in-addr.arpa whacked on to the end. Something critical to note here, is that with a reverse DNS lookup for 1.2.3.4 is completely independent of the forward lookup for that host name. That is why the reverse lookup is important for mail servers, ssl servers etc. For a mail server, when an SMTP transaction is negotiated, the sender gives a HELO (or EHLO) command with the host name. Since this is all done over a TCP connection, you also get the sending mail servers IP address. If everything is on the up-and-up, the reverse DNS of the IP address should resolve to whatever the HELO specified. Of course as stated above by @Zordeache, the only header you can trust at all is the one issued by your server. Within this header, the sending hostname from the HELO (forgeable) is usually shown in the mail header along with the IP address from the TCP connection (not easily forgeable). For email, all a spammer has to do is make sure their reverse and forward lookups for their scummy spam spewing barf box match, which is not hard. Fortunately though, many spammers are careless with their setups, and being strict about this check stops a lot of it. 

Unfortunately that's a bit vague to start with. Define "performance drops a lot". This is one of those situation wheres there's about 20 different things to check, both hardware and software. Hardware: - do you have a good decent nic on both ends? (intel/broadcom), not realtek - do you have a managed switch? - Is the managed switch maybe unavailable to do all the process switching if small packets? - have you tried swapping network cables - confirmed it's gigabit? - perhaps your harddisks can't keep up with the data streams? generic basic harddrives can be maxed out on gigabit. - do have a network card that does TOE? Software: - are you using mtu 9000 aka jumbo buffers in card? - have you looked at tuning receive windows or buffers? - What OS? - If windows, do you have av/firewall software running? Applicationlevel/Data: - is it being encrypted? (tunneled over ssh?) - What protocol? ftp/cifs/rsync/http/nfs - what are the size of files? thousands of small files or one really large one? There's so many places to start, but those are some questions you need to answer to yourself. Once you get to the software level, I would recommend using iperf between the 2 machines and seeing what the maximum of raw data you get. That will tell you the highest possible speeds. Then you can compare it to what your application is giving you. 

The server does not seem to be sending a reply here. I would try cranking the debug up to 11 on the server side and see what it is whining about. How much time elapses after the publickey packet is sent waiting for the reply when it fails? If it i 

to add a new one. I don't know if you should leave the $URL$ source there or not - it depends on if you have some nonstandard version of a gem installed from there or not. If you do, I would suggest adding that source in your Gemfile, NOT as your gem source. This can be done with something like this: 

If these are incorrect, then your domain registration likely has the wrong name servers, so you must fix this. If these are correct, then are they returning the correct answer when you query them? In your dig +trace above they are returning 

The whole enchilada, huh? OK, first reverse DNS (for ipV4) goes something like this. Ya start with an ip address, say 1.2.3.4. You want to find out what A records (hosts) are associated with this ip address. The DNS guys are totally Clever Dudes, so they made the the lookups for IP addresses work pretty much the same as for regular domains. In order to do this, they have to make them go from more specific on the left, to more specific on the right. With a forward host name: 

We've got a bit of a situation where an Exchange 2000 system was migrated to 2010 and all was fine. That was a few months ago and the 2000 server was retired. Some bright sparks just realised the public folders were never transfered across. So I've booted up the 2000 server and I can't access any of the public folder (although the folders are displayed) 

I'm setting up a new citrix box and trying to set a 20gb area to hold ISOs for the VMS. I'm trying to setup a new lvm area to hold it, but i'm getting an 

I'm upgrading our network from Exchange 2003 to Exchange 2010 and it's going swimmingly. Well it was, I've moved some users to the 2010 box with blackberries (iphones working fine) and I can't get it working with BIS (blackberry internet services) Whatever settings I try I get a 

When I try to RDP directly to the IP of one of the RDS servers it's redirecting me to the other RDP server and I can't work out. Doesnt seem to be load balancing etc Here is a video of it in action: $URL$ 

Unfortunately this is a vague issue and it needs to be narrowed down. One of the first things that needs to be done is to make a chart clarifying what the problem is, and for whom. Chances are fixing the wireless network will improve your network greatly, but that might not be the real problem. One of the main questions would be , are the people who are physically wired in experiencing problems? If so, then that shifts the focus from the wireless issue to a server/application level issue, perhaps upgrade from older switches to gigabit etc. Wireless is not as good as a physical cable. Especially with consumer wireless routers/access points. They're designed for a few people to surf the internet, not a business network. Chances are the wireless network isn't operating as well as it should be. Few options: 

Well, we eventually couldnt figure it out and ended up to making someone drive 9 hours to get last known backup tapes :p Not fun at all. Moral of story: 1.) have more than 1 DC at all times 2.) back the systemstate up constantly and verify! 

as the default apache domain and example.com if that is the only one that you want to use ssl for. I would also turn on debugging for your rewrite rules so you can see if they are actually firing. If the issue is the ssl issue mentioned above, I suspect you are not even getting that far. Hope this helps. 

etc. When you encrypt it with SSL, everything after the GET line is encrypted, so Apache has no way of even knowing what host you are asking for. Without knowing the host, it has no way of knowing which certificate to use to decrypt the request. It also has no idea which directory to redirect to, which .htaccess file to use or anything else determined by the host. For this reason, AFAIK you can only use a single ssl host per IP address. I would try setting 

I don't know what host you are running them from (i.e is run on the nameserver or another host?) so I can't be of much help. When you do run dig though, please use the +trace option so you can tell exactly where things go off the rails.
