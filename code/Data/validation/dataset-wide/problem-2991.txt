The "ideal agent" interpretation of Bayesian reasoning in science. I thought I would add this answer, which is a more direct response to the title of the question: 

This makes the language quite tricky, generally "nothing that is P" refers "there is no X such that X is P", nothing is not a thing. Yet, if we are talking about the observable universe, the nothingness outside the universe might actually refer to something. Leading to a very strange usage of the word 'nothing' as "things which we don't know about". This is a source of confusion. If there is actual nothingness (1) then you are asking about the impossible. If there is "epistemological nothingness" (2) then the best we can say is "who knows!" (though the cosmological principle would suggest that it would be very much the same as here) 

Ethics is concerned with what is right and what is wrong, for whatever reason that might be: it might be something to do with society, it might not. Ethics can be interpreted using social contracts, but they need not be. Kant's ethics are the counter-example that comes to mind. 

If the first case, there is nothing that exists outside the universe and there would be nothing you could do about it. You could never get "outside" of it, because it always contains you, no matter where you are in (or not in, for that matter) space-time. It sounds more like you are talking about the observable universe, which may or may not have nothing outside of it. It's not generally considered practical to get outside of the observable universe, and scientist often use "universe" instead of "observable universe" because they are trained to avoid speculating on things that are thought to be unknowable. This is important, because there are now two meanings of nothing, so that when I say "there is nothing beyond the universe" it can mean 

This clearly causes problems for anyone thinking God is unlikely. Of course it possible to reject the (probabilistic version of the) law of excluded middle (XM), but you'd need a good reason to do so. As either: 

Proper time is coordinate invariant, so simultaneity according to it will not depend on the observer (their reference frame). Two observes may not agree on whether events are simultaneous if they judge it according to the time coordinate (equivalent to 1). In proper time, photons are emitted and arrive at their destination simultaneously. You can see this in the equation I gave for proper time by setting . 

But the definition of atheism is far from unrecoverable. For example, one option would be to take atheism to correspond with a probability anywhere less than or equal to 50%: where people are undecided through to rejecting Gods absolutely. In this case it would be wrong to say "it's not a belief" but, as you include the 50%, value you could get away with saying "it's not necessarily a belief" Edit: a slightly less, but still rather, simple probabilistic model Now lets consider statements of the kind, "there is a God and his it is the Christian God", which I will assume for the sake of argument is the same as "the Christian God exists". These would extend the result above in the following way: 

It's rather short, but I wouldn't call it abrupt. He gives examples of people lives depending on the answer to the question "what is the meaning of life". These examples are ones we are all familiar with and understand. As the answer to the question is something that determines how people live and die, he concludes that it is an important (i.e. "urgent") question. 

I would consider most of advertising a form of rhetoric, with advertising being rhetoric employed to a particular kind of end. An example where I would say rhetoric is not advertising is advocacy. In advertising the end is usually to get people to buy stuff, or to get people to act in a certain way. In legal advocacy the ultimate goal is not to persuade: persuasion is simply a means to a just outcome. Although the more immediate aim undertaken by an advocate is to win, there are specific rules governing how they attempt this. In arguing for their side they are serving the higher purpose of justice. Some advertising isn't rhetoric. This is a very small class of advertising techniques where there is no attempt at persuasion, just manipulation. This would include attempts at subliminal advertising and any other attempt at directly changing peoples behaviour without their conscious awareness. This, however, depends on a distinction between persuasion and manipulation that some people may disagree with. 

As for the term "suturing", as opposed to "suspension", it seems to imply some kind of bidirectional, close, almost-knotted, relationship between philosophy and music, rather than one being simply derived - hanging from - from the other. Some kind of feedback, where philosophy takes music as its focus and music then expresses the philosophy it has had a hand in making. Where all the suggestions above are a component. So, perhaps a good example would be hip-hop with it's conspicuous self-reference and criticism (though it's by no means unique in doing this). But as I said, I have no idea really. 

Generally speaking, no (in either school), especially when the God is question is some kind of being. As a Westerner its very difficult to not see the Tao through a Western lens especially when translators translate it as God in an attempt to make it more accessible. Generally speaking, it is translated as "way" not because the translators are being overly literal, but because "way" is a really good word for what it describes. I think it's probably easiest if we go with the English word "way" as a guide to the meaning of Tao. Not because it is exactly correct, but because it's close enough for our purposes. Is God a "way" in any reasonable sense. Not really. The Christian religion might be called this (in fact it is: the way of Christ). But the Christian God Himself is not usually thought of in this manner (Let's assume John 14:6 means something more like "I can show you the way"). SEP says no also, I've highlighted the most important bit - the quote is from a long article which is probably worth reading if you are interested in the topic: 

Within Bayesian reasoning you certainly can combine beliefs in arguments together and get a single probability. If you accept Bayesian reasoning as a model of scientific induction then you accept that you can combine arguments to yield a single probability. However, not everyone accepts the premise that Bayesian reasoning is a good model, in fact, the discussion has been rather heated over the years. Many people think of Bayesian reasoning in science to be a model of ideal inference. As long as you give it the reasonable prior probabilities, or evidence that overwhelms the prior, you get the correct answer. If the Bayesian model does not share ones priors and there is little evidence, then you should not listen to it: GIGO. I'll skip over the difficulty concerning giving probabilities to mathematical statements. The practical reality preventing combining probabilities of lots arguments... I think the main reason people don't try the approach you mention is that assigning probability to a bunch of arguments and then concluding from those probabilities (a) doesn't convince anyone and (b) is quite hard. I'll explain this further, but first I should say that the argument from the 2014 article is a very simple one 

The difficulty in testing these things lies in it being an historical hypothesis and with the ethics of human experimentation. First of all, I should respond to alanf's answer: it contains a view of the nature/nurture debate that I consider a red herring... Genes affect behaviour, and it is testable... It might be an uncomfortable fact, but behaviour is causally affected by genes. How could it be otherwise? Genes determine our physical make up, and our physical make up is a huge factor in our behaviour (for example, congenital blindness will effect whether someone drives a car). Of course there are social factors and they matter, but just because a behaviour is influenced by culture it does not mean that it isn't influenced by genetics. When alanf says "you can't tell whether the behaviour is a result of genetic of cultural evolution" he is introducing a false dichotomy. Things can have more than one cause, and moreover it is also possible to investigate things with multiple complex causes scientifically. The fact that we can answer some questions about genetics and behaviour doesn't mean that we can answer all of them. Likewise, not being able to answer some of them does not mean we cannot answer any: "not testable" is a wild generalisation. Historical difficulties and ethical challenges With all evolutionary explanations there is always the difficulty that we cannot turn the clock back and do experiments. We cannot actually do experiments to directly determine what would happen if X was different. We can only make inferences about it based on our current situation. We simply don't have experimental access to our ancestors, and we have to work around. This severely restricts what can be answered, as we often have to make inferences about dead ancestors based on their living descendants (this is true of all evolutionary theory). With the study of non-human species there are fewer ethical barriers, one can intervene at the genetic level, or put animals in situations that would threaten autonomy were they human. With humans, ethics puts huge constraints on what experiments can be performed. One often finds situations where a hypothesis is falsifiable or verifiable in theory, but not in practice. What this means The consequence of this is that we must test hypotheses incredibly indirectly, making them rather weak and contingent. Still, one can add weight to them by testing lots of different associated components and use each of them as evidence in the larger argument. It's probably worth pointing out that medical science is quite atypical, here people do directly test: "does this treatment cause my patients to recover?" - elsewhere theories get support from being connected and consistent with lots of other theories and data. In summary. Human evolutionary disciplines are particularly difficult as the experiments and theories used as evidence are quite "distant" from what is to be shown. There are significant constraints which stem from the historical nature of evolutionary theory and the ethics of human experimentation. These difficulties are probably why no experiment was expected of them. So, to answer your final question, probably not, at least not if one wishes to behave ethically.
