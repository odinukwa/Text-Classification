A point missed in other answers is the saddle, which may be leather. If it is leather, then avoid washing it with water. Instead treat with an appropriate leather conditioner and preserver product 

* Impact driver - the least destructive. Do be super careful that you're undoing the nut, not tightening it (BTDT) If that doesn't work, take the bike to a local workshop and ask nicely if they can use an air rattle gun. 

Does this frame have mounting points down on the rear dropouts? The sort sometimes used for mudguards/fenders, which can be repurposed for the downshafts of a rack. Since they hold most of the weight, a front mount is relatively lightly loaded. I made a couple of clamps out of thin sheet metal for my rack, which wrap around the seat stays and bolt through the rack. View from above Looking backwards 

replace the rear wheel - this is the most expensive, but gives you peace of mind and a warranty. I couldn't afford this. replace the damaged spokes. Spokes are between $1 and $3 unless you have weird ones. You will need a "spoke nipple tool" and whatever tool is needed to remove your cassette/freewheel from the hub of the wheel. Simply replace the most-damaged spokes one at a time, duplicating the under/over pattern. Once they're replaced, use the nipple tool to true the wheel. do nothing and wait for the spokes to break. Depending on the level of damage you might be able to ride fine for a long time as-is. 

The quickest fix is to flood the cassette with solvent to free up the pawls that are stuck. Often they wedge up in the grease that has been exposed to water and turns into a thicker and harder gum. Solvent (be it citrus, diesel, petrol, turps, etc) will dissolve the existing gunk and allow the pawls to be pushed out by their springs. Once the solvent has done its job you want to let it all evaporate, then relubricate with something new. Don't be tempted to ride around without, cos it will rust up real quick. Another very temp fix is to simply tap the cassette to try and make a pawl drop. if this works at all, its not a long term solution. Personally I'd look at replacing the part, but you specified an easy solution. 

The only way to do this would be lights that are integrated into your frame so they can't be removed. Not a cheap option. Instead, leave your lights and tools, etc in a bag that can be removed from the bike with one motion, or in a backpack, so you have them but only fit the lights to the bike when you need them. I don't generally leave the helmet at the bike either... I've had one stomped to pieces while I was elsewhere 

Schwalbe's website would say no. Your maximum tyre size on a 15mm clincher rim is 32. To carry a 47mm tyre properly you want a 15mm rim to 27mm rim I've run big tyres on rims too small, and after a while the tyre sidewall failed at the edge of the rim. 

In your case, the bike might be "over the recommended load" but you're working on that BY riding. If you find that the bike is not performing to your needs then an additional/replacement bike might help. This is different from you not performing as expected! What would a fatbike do for you that your current bike doesn't? It would likely go slower, weigh more, be harder to climb grades, and tubes/tyres are expensive. On the plus side it would "float" over sand snow and loose dirt better, but it is not necessarily going to be any stronger or tougher than your existing bike. You're only 20 kilos heavier than me, and you've already uprated the rear wheel. I'd suggest riding it while you work on your fitness, and plan on a replacement bike in a couple years. 

To answer the other part of your question, No you can upgrade the groupset later. Assuming you buy a wheel with an 11 speed hub, then your existing 9 speed cassette should fit it, and an 11 speed cassette is the same width but with thinner chain. You'll need a new chain of course, and a right-hand shifter that has 11 positions not 9. You should be able to use the front chainring as-is, subject to wear. I can't say whether you will need a new rear derailleur or not - you should get away with the current one, but its not guaranteed. New shift cable and housing too because why not? 

Looking at the spec, your bike has a double front chainring. Are you shifting into the smallest front ring when climbing? If not, then do so. You can possibly buy a smaller front chainring too, that will leave the higher gears alone for faster/road usage, like downhills. 

Another repair plan would be to buy a new wedge - this probably means a new/replacement quill stem. If there's a bike coop near you they might be able to help. 

Zoom in and there's a loop of black inner cable that drops out just in front of the bottom bracket and loops underneath. Look to be a medium sized square/rectangular plate that may undo. Please have a close look there and see if the plate comes off easily. Do take some clear photos and post them in your own answer, showing how you found it. 

Maximum down position is odd - that's when the power stroke is over so its not the pressure causing your noise. Did you assemble it yourself? Could be a loose pedal, or a pedal bearing needing lube. Try popping the chain off the chainwheel and pretend to pedal. See if the noise still exists. If yes then its not your chain. Finally - since your bike is new, have you taken it back to the shop for a tune up? Almost all bike shops offer a tune after 6-12 weeks to fix up cable stretch issues etc. A minor creak like this should be covered by that, or by warrranty. 

The slot in the back can be a focus for water to enter the seat tube and weep its way down into the bottom bracket. Especially if you don't have a rear mudguard/fender. One common solution is to fit a short section of old tube so it covers the whole clamp and slot area. If you fasten this tube to the seatpost with a ~1.5 inch hose clamp, that can provide enough resistance that the proper seat post clamp does its job. Downside, its a dirty hack bodge fix, and makes your nice bike look strange. Having a small amount of anti-seize inside your frame seatpost mount is a good idea, because it stops them seizing in place. Could be yours has grease, where something like copper antiseize paste would be better. 

Although if your bike had water in it and that froze, you would have a different problem. To deal with this, dry your bike, and hang your bike so it drains - often there are two breather/drainholes at the aft end of the chainstays... but do eyeball them first. 

Wheelbase the distance between front and rear wheel contact points. A 20" folder has a wheelbase of about 102 cm, and a 16" is about 97 cm. Compared to a MTB at 110 cm to 120 cm. Short wheelbases are inherently twitchier, and long wheelbases are more stable at speed while cutting a longer curve. 

I think you're on the wrong track looking at batteries because they're heavy, stealable, fragile, and bad ecologically. Firstly, you already have an airhorn installed in the middle of your face. Its steerable so it always sounds in the direction you're looking. Plus it needs no batteries, and best of all it plays a customised noise, from "OI!" to "LOOK OUT!" to "STOP!" That was a serious suggestion, but if you want a horn consider an airhorn something like $URL$ It refills from a bike pump and is lighter than a battery, plus no drag from a generator/alternator. My own experience - I put a small 1.2AH 12V battery inside a disposable 600 ml bottle, and used a small car battery charger to charge it. I also put a car 12V-->USB adapter in the mouth of the bottle to run my camera and cellphone. This worked well, but loses a drink cage. My electric bike has 3x 7AH SLA batteries. They are in a frame built from light angle aluminium and rivets. This replaces the main drink bottle cage and works fine, but probably overkill for your requirements. 

If you're feeling unsure, wimp out and buy/borrow an adjustable stem. They're heavy and complex, but you can pick an angle and a length, tighten the bolts, and try it for a ride or two. 

I suggest you change your cassette now, before you get accelerated wear on your chain. At 1% chain stretch, the cassette was as worn as the chain. Have a very close look at the cassette with your chain in the gear that skips the most. I suspect that if you add tension by pressing lightly on the pedal by hand, that only one link is making good contact with cassette teeth, and there may even be light visible "under" the chain. Of course this is based on rule of thumb. 

In reality, your bike needs some maintenance. If you're competent with tools then you can do this yourself, otherwise you're up for shop labour costs. I would strongly suggest replacing both brake levers, even though only one is broken. Its probable they are the same brand and the other one could suffer the same breakage. 

Getting the alignment perfect might be hard and require tweaking, but this temp solution allows you to undo it and make adjustments. Consider welding it in place. - this would have to be perfect, and it does make replacement of the cog difficult. But it won't move or slip on you! 

I have no idea what brand it might have been. And really the brand means little. From your two photos I see 90s hybrid bike brazed with lugged steel (not welded like I originally said) - you can see the bronze around the bottom bracket. Dunno if the flat bars are original... the single rear derailleur looks a bit odd mounted on the quill stem. Normally they'd have thumb shifters. And that orange shift cable outer looks decidedly weird looping up at the back chainstay. The wheels may not be original either. There appears to be a relatively large tyre on both wheels, at a guess 32mm or 35mm ? The mud/colour makes it hard. Schrader valves imply larger tyre widths too. Quick Release skewers also implies no older than the 90s. There's a bulbous bump in the seatpost - does the bike have seatpost suspension? There's an odd plastic thing on the seat pole just below where the stays are attached. Not sure of its function. What is it? The crankset looks relatively modern - I suspect this has been converted to a single chainring at some point. 

I think its totally fixable. I know of metalworkers who would relish the two-part challenge of this. 

I have some generic cantilever brake levers on my MTB. The brake reach adjustment screws are normally fully wound out, so are not limiting the brake's reach at all. Can I remove them permanently ? I can't see any downside? 

When I have a dead tube where a patch doesn't work, I check the valve and save the core if its removable. Your quick fix is to replace the valve core, cos the tube is probably fine. Of course with the valve like this you can't inflate it, and you can't ride it, so swapping the tube for a spare, and fix/test it at your leisure. (actually I save the complete valve most of the time... Schrader valves make for great water bottle rockets, a fun kid project for summer. ) 

Ask the Seller/Owner A simple thing if you're receiving a bike is to ask the person selling it. Take their info with a grain of salt though - some sellers may lie to increase the perceived value of a bike. However if someone gives you a bike, they might say "I remember my dad riding this to work in the 80s while I was at school" So this information may be authoritative, or it may be an indicator to be combined with other factors. 

You mean the shoulder that is inboard from the square taper? If the crank manages to snug onto the square taper far enough that it hits the shoulder but remains loose, then the crank arm is worn and needs replacing. The tolerances will not allow a good crank to press hard against the shoulder, so don't worry. 

I'd suggest selling on the campy shifters on ebay and use the proceeds to fund some boring but common shimano ones. Or go the other way and look for a campag rear wheel and derailleurs, but these will likely be more rare and therefore cost more. Reference link: $URL$ 

Flipping it about - how much do you need to keep? So 24% of your car is "structure" which will cover chassis. The external panels add 5%. Wheels and tyres are needed to roll, brakes to stop, that's 10%+3% Suspension can probably be lightened because of the weight drop but you'll still need half of it at 5.5%. Interior of 10% could be reduced by half to 5%. For a total of just over 50% Lets assume you can HALVE the weight of your lightweight car by removing non-essentials. That leaves 375 kilos of dead weight that you still have to move around. And that's simply ignoring the weight of your pedal propulsion system still to add. 

In complete opposition to the above statements, we also have the retro beach cruiser or coffee cruiser bikes. These are a little above a cheap BSO, and have a sit-up-and-beg posture combined with sweeping handlebars and relatively few gears. The pricing is about double what a cheap BSO costs, but the appeal here is the nostalgia and a "this is what older people ride" mentality. 

Brand new bike? The silvery-inner cable for the gears has settled and effectively stretched. This is normal - all decent bike shops will offer a tune-up after a month or 6 weeks. If you bought it on-line then you'll have to fix it yourself or pay a LBS to do it. If your bike was used, then it could still be stretched cable, or the cable may have slipped in the clamping mechanism at the rear. Fix is the same. 

If you had hydraulics then there are all manner of pressure switches, used in automotive brake systems. However they would affect the speed at which your hydraulic brakes activate and would void any warranty. 

I have an old steel frame road bike, dating from 1980. Its not rare or special, but its very like the one I rode to high school in the late 80s. Problem: There are no bottle cage mounts, so my solution is to drill 4 holes and fit rivnuts to suit the standard bottle mounts. Rivnuts are also known as nutserts, and look like this: 

For others who don't own a power meter (and lets face it, they're not cheap) Its a poor data point, but a chap at work has a power meter and he can compare this number with strava's estimated power. We've compared ~three races and strava's number was high or low by up to 30% So your 230W could be as low as 160W or as high as 300W. Repeated tests will help narrow the range. Another analogue solution is to ride hard for ~20 minutes to the point you can say words but not a whole sentence. Then use Strava's estimator on that segment. Repeat. If you have a Heart Rate Monitor, try and hold your heart rate at around ~90-95% of your rated maximum, which is about 220-(your age in years) 

90% chance its a generic BSO. If you have a distinct feature, post a photo and someone might recognise it, but... Why do you want to bother identifying the maker? You already have a frame that will have certain dimensions or bearing sizes. There's little if anything to be gained from buying parts from the manufacturer. Your best tools are likely to be a vernier caliper and a thread gauge, to find specs for parts you might need to make frame into a whole bike. 

Fenders/frames If you want to fix the rust, you could simply paint over it, but that fix will last months at best. Remove the rust physically by sanding or foil and then painting, and it will come back after a year or more. The best fix is to chemically treat the rust with a rust killer like Phosphoric Acid, which converts the brown/red rust into a stable white or black iron oxide. Then you sand it and paint over. This should last the longest. Rims Much harder to deal with - because anything put on the braking surface will wear off quickly under braking. Best technique here is to scratch the rust off using a brass brush, and then apply the phosphoric acid to treat the bits you missed. Ideally do this with the tube and tyre off. And mind your skin - this stuff is nasty.
