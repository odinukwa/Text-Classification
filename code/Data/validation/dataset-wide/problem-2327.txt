This isn't really a clear yes/no sort of question, I'm also pretty reticent to tell someone what would be best for their child. Aside from that hopefully someone will provide some information that will make your decision or others thinking of doing the same easier. My first suggestion would be to work out which huts you are thinking of staying at or around and ring the guardians who are usually very helpful/knowledgeable! I don't know how much you know about huts in the alps but some things to consider; 

I think the best thing you could do would be to borrow a smaller pair from a friend next time you go climbing (or rent a pair) and see what works best for you. some general guidelines; 

Of course this also necessitates the implementation of the whole Sprit rig, but it might be just what you need. 

Here's a decent video detailing just how to do it: Basically filet it like any other fish. Remove the "dark meat" that is pungent and distasteful. Then remove the row of spines. Taste tests described in the video show that virtually everyone preferred asian carp (poached or fried) over the other varieties such as tilapia. Here's another one narrated with a great accent. 

This type of dry fly floatant powder is quite effective at drying off smaller flies. I believe it's the same silica gel that is used to keep packaged electronics dry. But I typically just press flies between folds of a cotton t-shirt briefly. This will draw most of the water out and restore "floatability" to the fly. It should also leave it dry enough to put back into storage. 

Just face the pointy bits towards each other and wrap the webbing around the bundle to keep them together. I then just chuck them in the bottom of my bag if I know I don't need them or in the top if I know I will. You could pad them with a hat, spare socks or what ever if you were worried about other more delicate items. Also even if they start out sharp once they've encountered a small amount of scrambling or walking up some moraine they're unlikely to be sharp enough to damage something unless you're being very forceful in your packing / unpacking. 

If you have been unable to retrieve the cam using the other methods described another climber will almost certainly abseil in or climb up to it and claim it as Crag Swag. 

Not, it is not. Poison sumac would not be found in a managed bed of pachysandra. It is found in wet areas where pachysandra wouldn't grow as well as it is right there. Here is some more info 

Take it to a knife smith. They have specialized equipment, experience, and knowledge. They'll be able to put an appropriate grind back on it and address any other issues. 

From what I understand, the floatation characteristics should be relatively similar since both types of hair contain "chambers" that keep in air and provide floatation. An important difference is how they behave when tied. Deer hair will flare more when wrapped, while the elk hair will tend to remain straighter under the same wrapping conditions. I found this article from MidCurrent to be pretty informative. 

So far I've far avoided needing to make such a repair but most of the repairs I've seen in the wild have either been gaffer tape or a patch of fabric stuck on with seam sealant. Sometimes if its a small hole just pinching it together and covering with seam sealant. Six Moon Designs has a useful guide for which sealants are best for which materials and a recipe to make your own. I'll summarize below encase the link becomes dead. silnylon use McNett's SilNet Polyester Fabric use McNett's Seam Grip or McNett's Seam Sure Cuben Fiber use McNett's SilNet or McNett's Seam Grip DIY seam sealant 

Why should you care so much about your aerobic fitness? because the body can only store about 2500 calories in glycogen, the fuel used to generate power anaerobically as apposed to around about 100,000 calories in fat, which will be used to generate power aerobically. As alpine climbing is an endurance activity lasting sometimes several days you can see that dipping into your glycogen supply is a luxury that should be reserved for difficult crux moves or unexpected emergencies, not to compensate for a lack of aerobic fitness on the approach. The most effective training will likely be quite boring unless you have access to some really nice country side. Walking with a weighted pack up something, local steep hill, stair master, staircase of multi-story building. Put something like water or rocks in your bag that you can dump out at the top to save your knees on the descent. I'd avoid running with weight for the same reason. Improving aerobic fitness is quite a large topic but the consensus is low intensity high volume. Adequate recovery is as important as the workout. 

If by braided line you mean something like spider-wire or power-pro, they wouldn't have the backbone to turn over a fly - especially something you are likely to throw for bass. Most bass plugs are fairly large and they float - so the leader/tippet doesn't really have to float. It could even be argued that you're better off with it NOT sitting on the surface where it will cast a shadow and be more visible from below. Mono/fluorocarbon virtually disappears below the surface. IF you are using a sinking bass fly - say like a leech, you don't want the leader to float anyway. HOWEVER if you are dead set on your leader floating you could always apply something like Gink fly floatant to the leader - OR fall back on the old standby - nose oil. 

This will a bit of a more general answer because I don't run 10k but... Peak fitness is something you aim to hit at a certain point in time and is not something that can be maintained for a great period of time. Expecting to perform your best every time will likely lead you to be disappointed. That's not to say you're not capable of running 10k faster than your current best every day, just not yet. 

This sounds like a great idea. Wild camping is permited under the Land Reform Act. Outdooraccess-scotland have put together a useful summary of how it relates to your access rights. Key points from which are; Does it mean I can camp anywhere? 

Avoid anything that has a strong odor. (Deos, soaps et al). Avoid bright coloured clothes. (It was told to me that bright coloured clothes can attract unwanted attention and possible aggression from elephants who are very protective of their young). Avoid watering holes. (These are frequented by elephants and it is best to not camp near to one) Look for signs of broken branches/trees, elephant dung(trust me you wont miss this!) and stay away from those paths which are frequented by elephants. Never get too close to one in case you do find an elephant. Climbing up a tree or running up a mountain won't help either. For elephants can tear down a tree and use their trunk as a fifth limb. Bamboo is a delicacy. You might want to stay away from heavily bambooed forest areas. Last but not the least, keep a fire up all night at your camp and never intrude the personal space of an elephant. 

To gather nesting material - small twigs or fluffy seeds As a nesting location - good cover or protected location To eat insects that are attracted to the plants - flowering plants will be covered in insects which myriad birds eat - even when they are commonly known as seed eaters birds will look for the protein in insects. Heck, insects are a huge part of even a hummingbird's diet. To eat the seeds. This might feel like little more like putting out a feeder (which is undesirable), but in this case there won't be the massive quantities being dumped out at once. The plants will ripen their seeds over time and they may be of no interest to many rodents anyway. 

While exercising you are not actually getting stronger you are damaging your body, but your body will adapt to the stress of training by getting stronger during the recovery phase. As the diagram above shows your fitness will peak for a period of time after the initial stress, provided the intensity was not too high or low. What you need to do is find out what the correct amount of stress is for your body and by which point your recovery has peaked. 

I'm not sure that anyone can give you a specific number that will suit your needs. Its worth bearing in mind that the temperature ratings on sleeping bags are created using a somewhat arbitrary test involving a dummy with sensors read more. The good thing about this test is that it creates an objective position from which to judge a sleeping bags insulation value. The down side is that human experience of warmth is massively variable. Are you the type of person who puts a jumper on while your friends are still happy in shorts and t-shirts or visa-versa? I would start by borrowing a couple of sleeping bags and trying to sleep in them at a range of temperatures you expect to face. Failing that simply using them and seeing if you find the ratings to be conservative or generous. This would then give you a suitable reference point when deciding what you need for a sleeping bag for your trip. Many other factors apart from the sleeping bag will affect your temperature, fitness, body fat, calorie intake, fatigue, exposure to wind or rain, insulation from the ground, adding additional insulation while sleeping e.g. cloths. 

I would hesitate to do so. The keen wading sandals I've worn let in a fair amount of gravel. This gravel, when caught between the sandal and the neoprene bootie, will make mincemeat of the bootie - causing it to leak. Gravel is a concern even when using full-on wading boots. To combat this many waders have gaiters built in. Mine do not, but I purchased neoprene gaiters to help keep gravel out. That said, I have use an old pair of high-tops over my neoprene booties - with the gaiter. Works just fine as long as the traction is up to the job. 

That is cause by clearcut timber harvesting. Timber harvesters will remove branches from trees that they fell and leave them on site. They will also sometimes leave specimen trees to help repopulate the area - or leave undesirable individual trees or species. The standing trees might also be the result of a weak implementation of a clearcut with reserve.
