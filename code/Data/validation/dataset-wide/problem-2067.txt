You have minimal to no applicable work history/experience in this field Your teammates consist of experienced software developers A recent lead developer quit & a recent developer quit too You were hired under a contract and rapidly got a "promotion" and raise 

While I indeed think Lilienthal's answer is quite good and exactly what the OP should do, I want to give a different perspective on the issue and highlight a few points: 

Try these strategies and the problem should improve and wasted time and effort should be dramatically reduced. 

I would say consolidate it and just elaborate on it briefly in an interview or phone screen; if they want more detail then fine, but most will know it is just a formatting decision. 

Should you [The OP] say anything in your letter declining the offer concerning diversity? No. As already pointed out, this can only hurt you (your reputation, networking potential, career, etc.). How much information did you [The OP] have to make the assessments of the company? There is a Greek word "Scotoma" (psychology definition) which perhaps explains this. You saw what you wanted to see and made conclusions based off that information, but did you ask all of the employees in that particular office about their backgrounds (school, education, family, religion, friends, politics, nationality, heritage, experiences, interests, career choices, culture, values, etc.)? You might be surprised by the answers to these questions. Did you [The OP] see the full picture? A large part of who works in a office is determined by geography and demographics. Most companies have many offices in different cities, states/provinces, countries, etc. and depending on where the office's geography is the type of people working their will come from that geography's surrounding demographic types. Some examples include Chinatown in New York, USA, as it has a prominent Asian demographic so businesses around there will have an increased likeliness to have hired Asians. Harlem in New York as well has a strong African American population thus the same result. Detroit in Michigan, USA has the same result as well. Utah in the USA has the strongest concentration of Mormans in the whole US thus most businesses and their employees are likely to be practicing Mormans. Little Italy in New York has a strong Italian demographic. And so on and so forth. 

You are misunderstanding the word "confidential". When government sources, lawyers, judges, etc. say "confidential" (in context to HR and companies) they are referring to 2 key principals: 

UPDATE With the additional information provided, there are some more points to consider: 1) Your boss is the founder of the company Ok, so this is very important. While yes, being the founder does give him certain privileges that are otherwise unobtainable, it does not completely exempt him from responsibility or repercussions because of his actions. Without going into legal reasonings, there are factors such as employee moral, workload, efficiency, and costs associated with replacing/firing/laying off (or equivalent in Germany) employees. Do not think he is "untouchable" or "has no superior" ... that would be the public or internal employees / managers that would note such actions. 2) You do not want to do something illegal or get fired for insubordination Sadly, you must make a choice about the issue. You cannot hold it in limbo forever, or much longer for that matter. Yes, the possibility of being let go is real, but depending on your relationship with the boss, work ethic, history at the company, etc., it is probably not likely if you are a good employee. If you feel that the request makes you uneasy then simply do not do it. Integrity is more important than money to many employers in many instances. Employers respect integrity and the willingness to stand-up and voicing concerns about an issue versus being a silent submitting "yes" man. If you have a family, then you might need to consider the financial idea of not having employment for sometime (however, you did not provide this information). You can easily reframe the firing into a positive in an interview by stating that "I was asked to do something potentially illegal and hurtful to the company as a whole and decided on the most ethical and legal action that was best for the company as a whole: voice my concern about the request and its legality". Again, I wish you the best of luck and hope for the best. 

Given these circumstances, you have a dysfunctional team and work environment. There are 2 ways to fix this issue: 

The obvious answer is to communicate with him and talk to him. The issue I face is I do not know how to approach my manager and stating (ie implying) that he is not doing his job correctly (which he is not). I know it's not my place to tell my boss he is not doing his job right, but his not doing it right causes me to waste my time. How do I communicate with a boss that does not take criticism or ideas at all? What are some conversation strategies or starters for this issue? Do I do it in person or over e-mail? etc Side Note: Another option I thought to avoid the communication issue would be to just reply to the e-mails and CC him saying "Handled". I am unsure if this will make me look naive or stupid because we get swamped with these e-mails so doubling up on them seems bad. We got so swamped and I had other tasks to handle that I fell a few days behind on these notifications that I had to lie about the dates I left voice mails for the individuals in question just to keep up. Is this idea of replying to the e-mails a good idea or no? 

I would approach the problem from a simple perspective. He made some changes on the code but did not let anyone know, right? If he likes authority and power, simply feed it to him. When you have a casual moment (lunch, around the water cooler, etc.) ask him in a polite and yet admiring way (sucking up is a tool to use wisely with seniority employees) 

Double Work: I don't know who he has handled and who he has not (or why) Negligent Retention: Any of his notes or counseling info is not logged in the system for audits later or previous history checks, putting everyone (and the company) at risk for lawsuits. 

Overall, try to communicate with her and work on plan moving forward. I would suggest keeping HR involvement on the down low (they look out for the company, not the employees); if you want a witness maybe ask another trusted and related manager to sit it on the conversations. If that fails then reevaluate your goals and strategy with this company and if it is worth it to stay. For the record, you are lucky to have survived not just 1 PIP but multiple which seems strange, perhaps they are not handled the same way in this company as they are normally. Feel out other employees if they have gotten PIPS, how that worked, etc. Seriously, I would start looking for another job as it seems like the company is going downhill. You're coming up to the end of one of the best hiring periods in a year. 

I recently got a new job (a little over 1 month ago) and in my letter of offer there was no mention of travel nor was there any mention of it in the job description. As of recently, I have been doing more and more "errands" for the department and they have all been local (i.e. less than 5 miles from the workplace; dropping off packages, picking up packages, etc.), but in the last week's time I have gotten some more requests to start doing more long distance errands (approx. 30-45 minute long errands (not including time to and from) which are important to my department: meeting customers, quality control visits, going to the state department's offices, going to other offices, etc.). My main issues are as following: 

I know that the managers (which I use loosely) in the company all have personal company cars which only THEY use. However, I cannot seem to get a personal company car (I did not ask, but I strongly doubt it). What is the "optimal" strategy to not perturb any manager/department and to not have to use my personal vehicle to run company errands nor the god awful Operation vehicles? What argument should I present to my "boss" for that strategy? P.S. The company's VP will be at my office tomorrow to go over some items and work with me on some tasks. He really likes me and I do not want to ask and seem like I am going behind anyone's back, but it might be worth it. Also, I am salary non-exempt...if that matters. Edit: I work in the US. 

I am not getting any mileage or reimbursement compensation for these trips I have done. I am using my personal vehicle for running these errands. My personal vehicle is not intended for long distance drives (it is over 20 years old, has almost 110,000 miles on it, and there are a few items I have yet to fix). 

With these in consideration, did you ask the other teammates why they don't want the position? Have you considered the strange fact that your minimal experience does not warrant such a promotion? Why did those other developers leave? Is there a future with the position/company? These are the questions I would ask myself. Depending on the position/requirements, being a lead role over people who are older than you (by a significant number of years) might cause some strain. Consider the various new challenges that would arise and if you think you can honestly handle them and have the experience to know how to lead/manage. It's highly unorthodox to give a recent graduate a lead (supervisory or managerial) based role without a few years of experience in the field and a year (or two) of seniority sensitive roles (ie roles that are not lead, but require similar demands and skills without the authority behind them). From my experiences with managers, most have about 5 years experience (or more) in their field and some experience/track record in management positions in those fields. Most managers I have worked with have been in their mid 30's to late 30's or older. Senior managers are usually late 40's or older. There is a reason for this age bracket: Experience & Wisdom are gained through time. As for your point about future employers, you are suggesting you are not interested in staying with this company then? Most people do not look at a promotion at a company in terms of future employers' perspective. I would only pursue positions that I intend to stay in for the long haul. Don't waste a company's time if you don't intend to stay. Nevertheless, a future employer might see the following points from the promotion (depending on your answers to the interviewer's questions):
