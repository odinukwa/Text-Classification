That seems quite strong. If you fire a rifle into the air, what are the chances that the bullet is going to hit the enemy commander? If you aim a sniper rifle with a scope, you should be able to do much better than 1 in 100,000,000,000. Battles would be very hard on leaders and wizards. The abilities to summon and banish monsters would seem to cancel out. That shouldn't be worse than an artillery exchange. Presumably both sides could control the weather, so they would tend to cancel out as well. If one side is dominant though, that could determine a battle. You might think that ability to change the probability of outcomes would cancel as well. The problem is that sniping is something that you do with surprise and which takes effect immediately. If you summon a monster or storm, it does damage over time. If you banish it, it stops doing damage. An accurate shot may be instantly fatal. There are other outcome related things that can be done. For example, what are the odds that a spark will flare up in the ammunition tent and trigger an explosion? What are the odds that a bomb will fall in the perfect location? This seems strong and without a counter in the system. You'd need to know the right time and location in which to counter. How would you? 

At a certain point, small stores become obsolete. You can already see this happening a little. Wal-Mart is replacing separate gardening, grocery, etc. stores. It's easier for people to go to one big store than many small stores. Or look at the way Amazon renders a physical store unnecessary. Not even Wal-Mart can match their inventory in a physical store. The real problem though comes with the advent of easy 3D printing. Why do you need a store at all then? Just put a 3D printer in your house. You can see this in Star Trek with replicators. You don't go to a tea store or even a grocery store--you just say, "Tea, Earl Grey, hot" and poof, it's there. Perhaps all "stores" will be virtual. They might even work more like Github, Wikipedia, or Stack Exchange. Shared content that people can update. No money changing hands, so not a "store" in the sense that we use it at all. 

Initially In the beginning, the colony will be a dictatorship or oligarchy. There will be one ruling body that will have been established on Earth. People who trust that ruling body will join the colony. People who don't won't. Note that some decisions may be made democratically from the beginning. But there will be a limited number of people responsible for colony safety in the early days. Otherwise they'll never get the mission off the ground. Over time When the initial dictator or a member of the oligarchy dies, the colony will have to make more decisions. Does Earth get to pick a replacement? Or does the colony? An oligarchy might even choose its own new member. Eventually If the ruler or rulers are picked autocratically, there will be increasing friction with the other colonists. Eventually there'll be rebellion. The rebellion may install a new autocratic government. In which case the same thing will eventually happen. Eventually they'll establish a democracy as the cheapest way to handle the rebellion. Don't like your current government? You can change it -- without shooting all the current members. Eventually some prospective leader will decide that being voted out of office is more gentle than being deposed. Personally, I think the time to introduce democracy is at the first change of government. I.e. when the first ruler leaves. If you're going to end up as a democracy eventually anyway, why fight it? But some people like doing things the hard way. 

Locks How do you protect yourself while you sleep now? Most people lock their doors and windows. At the advanced end, you might have a security system that calls the police in case of break-in. Hide You may be able to locate your sleeping place where no one can find it. Guards If dreamers are protecting normal people while dreaming, won't normal people be willing to protect the dreamers? Share Perhaps one dreamer can't afford guards, great locks, or even a secret hideaway. So group together. One or two dreamers might animate golems or their own physical bodies and hang back to protect the underground lair in the volcano. The others can be out fighting the nightmares. 

Public transport We haven't even finished automating our existing public transport on dedicated travel ways yet. There are automated subway trains, so they're further along than Google is. But they haven't finished converting. Many trains still have human personnel. New public transportation is expensive. For example, the California high speed rail system is currently projected to cost \$68.4 billion: $URL$ And that's a replacement for just one road. Note that the federal government only spends \$80 billion on transportation. So if it bought one high speed rail segment a year, it would have hardly any money left for maintenance of the existing roads, already underfunded. If we include local and state government spending on roads and water as well, we can get up to \$416 billion. That's still only enough for six segments even if we drop all spending on water, which is rather important. And that's only 3120 miles of travel way (six 520 mile segments). Note that the US currently has 2.6 million miles of paved roads. Even assuming that a million miles of that are redundant, we'd still need five hundred years to replace the existing road system. Unless you are willing to increase spending on transportation construction by a lot, this seems totally infeasible. Who wants to wait five hundred years for automated transportation? It's possible that high speed rail is more expensive to build than slower rail systems. Ohio's proposed more modest speed rail system was only expected to cost \$3.5 million per mile, not the \$140 million per mile of the California system. That's better. If we only double spending for twelve and a half years, we could replace the system. Of course, that system would also be more complex. Rail lines would cross each other. People would have to switch trains relatively frequently, almost as frequently as we switch roads. That complexity would bump up the cost again. Also remember that we have to maintain the existing roads while we build the new system and maintain the new system going forward. And what do we do with the obsolescent roads? It will cost money to block them off or tear them up as well. And note that this requires everyone to double the money spent on transportation. Sort of feasible for the federal government but difficult for local governments. A more reasonable alternative would have local governments maintain existing spending while the federal and state governments each put up enough for a new segment a year. That extends the process out another twenty-five years. That assumes that the Ohio projections were correct. Note that the California numbers increased by a lot from initial projections. If we quintuple the Ohio projections (which is the kind of cost increases that were in the California project), we get amounts more like what California is showing. And that assumes that the current California projections aren't still underestimating the costs. Even only doubling the costs, that takes us out seventy-five years. Automated roads Automated roads that manage traffic are better at avoiding car to car accidents, but they are worse at everything else. For example, what if a child decides to run across the highway? The road's automation can't control the child. So cars running on that road need to have just as many sensors and ability for independent reactions as the Google car. Otherwise, they are less safe. I think that automated roads are likely to occur at the end of the process rather than at the beginning. When many cars are automated, they'll start getting their own lanes like high-occupancy vehicles do now. They'll join in linked convoys so that most can shut off their motors and coast. But this requires cars to be automated first. Another issue is that the automated roads would only work with automated cars. If you put regular cars on them then the automated cars have to handle non-automated traffic. So they require automated cars to function. And how do you get to the automated road? You'd have to take legacy roads to get there. So the automated cars could not require the automated road, which just gets us back to the Google car. Google cars The Google approach is the only one that works in the near term, that allows automated and non-automated cars to share the road. That allows automated cars to make it all the way from the initial location to the destination without switching vehicles. And most people won't buy if their car won't go everywhere they need to go. The Google approach is clearly the most difficult to program, but tests show it to be feasible. If it's feasible, then it's easier in every other way. There is no evidence that people are interested in increased public transport. It's inflexible, inconvenient, and expensive. Most people would prefer to take their cars with them rather than switch to public transport that runs on its schedule, not theirs. Also, public transport only works if you're going to a place covered by public transport. Many people aren't. You can drive to public transport, but you can't drive your car after you leave it. The Google car approach is the most likely because it doesn't rely on other changes. It scales anywhere from one to a billion cars. The other approaches require a certain level of usage to function. It can also be implemented on an individual basis. A single individual can choose which car to drive. A single individual cannot choose to implement public transportation (unless really rich). Without the Google car, we'll never get to the point of being able to use automated roadways. We also won't be able to make taxis cheap enough to make public transport practical in general, not just when traveling from and to urban locations. For most people, the Google car is the only method that they could use. 

Tracking Cash has value because the government gives it value. So what if the government recalls all the cash? Instead of pieces of paper or metal, the government only gives value to online versions of money, like credit cards. From the government perspective, credit cards are far superior to cash. They are fully trackable. The issuers have to keep track of who paid whom to process the transactions. So the government can go back and see the transactions to collect taxes or to prosecute someone. So, no true cash. Taxes Since there is no cash, formal transactions require taxes. But due to the way that the tax system works, low wages are actually worse than no wages. People lose their welfare benefits without getting enough money in return. So they work under the table rather than accepting money. Since there's no cash, working under the table has to get other kinds of benefits than money. Minimum wage The minimum wage is actually greater than the value of a slum person's labor. So no company will pay it for slum labor. The only way that people can get jobs is under the table. But then the company can't pay with online money. Instead, they pay with goods. That way the government can't see the transactions. Companies are incredibly vertically integrated as a result. A company that produces banana yogurt has to grow its own bananas and manage its own dairy farms. Because of course if it bought from other companies, it could be tracked. Counterfeiting It is easy to adulterate or counterfeit notcocaine and dangerous to use it that way. Not necessarily fatal, but enough to make you miserably sick. So it's really important to trust your dealer. You can't trade notcocaine with someone you don't fully trust. One of the reasons why notcocaine could be easy to counterfeit is that it might be made to duplicate something common so the police can't be sure without lab testing. It could be like cinnamon or powdered sugar or talcum powder. But since the police can't tell, neither can the potential users.
