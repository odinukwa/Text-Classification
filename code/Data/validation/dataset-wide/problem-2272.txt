At the very most you should be able to cover your general requirements with 1 pack in each class. Though for many people, a single pack with a lightweight frame should cover all their needs. Finally, there is no standard for measuring pack volume so advertised capacity can vary widely between manufacturers. Again, the answer is to err on the large side. Something I've done in the past is to take my equipment into the store and see how it fits in the pack - a good specialised retailer should be happy accommodate you, particularly if you call ahead and ask. 

Late to the party, but the current answers don't really highlight a vital safety point for solo hikers. The risks of solo hiking have been transformed by the advent of PLBs (Personal Location Beacons). These are handheld units that transmit your rescue request and precise location via satellite to an international Rescue Control Center which will quickly alert your local Search and Rescue service. 

Why the A-Frame fell out of fashion Until around 25 years ago, A-Frames dominated the 1-2 person market, both for car camping and in the mountains. Then we saw the emergence of lightweight flexible fibreglass and aluminium poles, which opened up all kinds of possibilities for tunnel, geo and semi-geo designs. In a very short period the A-Frame designs virtually disappeared from the catalogues. Some contributing factors: 

Yes - it's true. The source is a 1984 study by the U.S. Army Research Institute, which found that it takes up to 6.4 times as much energy to move at a given pace when weight is carried in the footwear as against the torso. When I was a kid we all walked in monsters like this, at almost 4 lbs a pair (and that's before they get wet!): 

What are you options? As someone who makes their own shelters I've given a great deal of thought to the pros and cons of different architectures. But like most things involving gear choice, the real answer is that "it depends". Given that you are camping in exposed places, I wouldn't waste much time on the more exotic geodesic architectures - at the consumer end they are mostly designed for below the treeline, and at the mountaineering end they are designed for snow loading and are heavier than you really need for 3-season use. So your main choices boil down to the tunnel, the dome and the pyramid/tepee. You can't go far wrong with a good Scandinavian dome or tunnel You're not going to find any dramatic differences in the space to weight ratio between domes and tunnels - it really boils down to your subjective preferences in terms of features. They both use space effectively, and they both pitch easily and take the weather. The downside is that a robust design is likely to work out at around a kilo per person. But if you want to save weight, your best option is to consider a pyramid Your best option for significant weight savings would be pyramid or tepee. This is especially true if you or your party use walking poles, as in contrast to domes and tunnels you won't need to carry additional tent-poles. Even when made of ultralight materials, mids can be bomber when well executed. For Scandinavian conditions I would have no qualms about using a mid from vendors such as Mountain Laurel or SeekOutside. MLD DuoMid in stormy conditions... The downside of mids is their use of space - the walls slope and you have a pole in the middle. But the upside is that this architecture is more efficient in terms of poles and fabric. So in return for some mild inconveniences you can save significant weight. A spacious double-wall setup from Mountain Laurel starts at under 300g per person if your budget stretches to Cuben - a very significant saving over your typical Scandinavian tunnel or dome. More budget-friendly silnylon models will still work out significantly lighter. Some people don't get on with mids, while others swear by them and wouldn't use anything else. It's really a question of your own usage, preferences and dislikes. But if weight is a priority, I would suggest that mids are certainly an option worth exploring. 

Most frontpacks on the market don't do a great job with this. Here's the Zpacks offering, for example: 

Casual letterboxing with kids Much more commonly, people just look for the boxes ad-hoc as they walk. There are thousands of them out there (no-one knows how many) so in most areas they're not hard to find. You soon get a feel for the kind of places they are cached. Like most locals I only letterbox when I'm with kids, and they love to poke around the nooks and crannies till they find them. 

There is a route known as the East Atlantic Flyway used for migration between Eastern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Siberia, Northern Europe, Western Europe, and on to Africa. 

A lot depends on the climate, on your budget, and on how much you sweat on the move. Pros and cons of merino Merino is the king if you want to prevent odour and most people find that it's the most pleasant against the skin. It wicks quite well but holds around 25% more water than synthetics and takes around 50% longer to dry. Another issue is abrasion - if you wear a high wool content shirt directly under a pack you will quickly get holes in the shoulders and upper back. Finally, good wool garments can be expensive - keep an eye out for sales. Because of the advantages of wool, researchers have been working hard to offset the disadvantages through blending with synthetics and through structural innovations such as grid weaves. Two of the more interesting developments are Power Wool from Maldon Mills, and Rab's MeCo fabric from the oddly named 37.5. Pros and cons of synthetics Synthetics are cheaper and more durable, and wick even better - though if you sweat up in the cold (always a bad idea), there's a danger of flash chilling as moisture is drawn off your skin. Warmth for weight it is lighter than wool, and it dries a bit more quickly. But even with modern treatments most people find that it builds up a formidable whiff after a few days of wear, and it can be difficult to wash out the smell in the field. In my experience, the best of the synthetics is a good polyamide, which out-performs the more common polyester and polypropylene on odour, durability and weight. If you don't sweat too much you should be able to wear it for quite a few days without becoming too antisocial. A little known alternative - and my personal favourite A little known option is to wear a technical mesh such as Brynje next to the skin capped by a lightweight wool or synthetic layer. This is essentially a sophisticated string vest and gives the best of all worlds. Although it's polypropylene it doesn't build up odour, at least in my experience, presumably because it's so well vented. In the cold, it traps a layer of warm air against your skin. When it's wet or sweaty it keeps the damp capping layer off your skin. And when it's hot, you can unzip the capping layer and dump heat instantly. It's widely used in Scandinavia, but has only recently been spreading to the UK and the US. 

For cooking at cold and altitude, the pressurised liquid fuel stove is your friend. They're expensive and need some skill and care in use (practise before you take them into challenging situations), but they will perform much better than alcohol or canister stoves when the going gets tough. Here's a video that gives a good overview of how they are used. As you can see, it's quite a fiddly process. They require priming before use, and regular cleaning afterwards. The fuels are dangerous, so it's very important to read the instructions and apply good disciplines in use. If you get casual, bad things can happen! If you are using the stove in a first world country, you would want something like the MSR Whisperlite which is optimised for clean fuel:
