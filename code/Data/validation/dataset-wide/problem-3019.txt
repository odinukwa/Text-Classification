The Socratic Method is the best way to teach any person because it requires that the pupil make attempts to solve the problems before being comprehensively shown how to do so. Philosophy is a prime example, but it applies to everything, even mathematics or computer programming. In philosophy, mathematics, computer programming, lecturers often say something like: 

Foucault has clearly moved away from a phenomenological perspective if he now concerns himself with the meaning of a sign or a fact such as madness, and how that sign is defined by cultural and political agendas, rather than possessing an objective definition. Concurrently Foucault addresses the impossibility of an objective definition for such a term that is not intrinsically biased. 

The difference is essentially the same as that which Gottlob Frege discusses in his seminal work On Sense and Reference. Putnam essentially uses the word meaning in place of Frege's sense, presumably because it seemed more intuitive for Putnam to splinter reference from meaning rather than make meaning a redundant term in our language. The distinction between meaning and reference is simple: meaning/sense is the intension or the word, name or symbolic representation of an object; the reference is the thing to which the intension corresponds in the world—the reference is the object to which you are referring, if you will. For instance, if you think of a battery, you have the word battery and you have symbols for batteries, such as: 

Derrida generally resisted labels, and in particular he resisted the label of post-structuralism because his ideas were derived from structuralism—différance arising from Ferdinand de Saussure's linguistics—and, in point of fact, deconstruction only makes sense as long as it forms an extension of the structuralist approach, i.e. is within the bounds of a structuralist conceptual framework. For Derrida, structuralism was not completely wrong, it just had limitations like every other school of thought. Without structuralism, Derrida's work does not make a great deal of sense. By saying that deconstruction is antistructuralist he is essentially creating a binary opposition between structuralism and deconstruction, and so it would never be post-structuralist, because it depends on its opponent; even if it does dismantle and criticise structuralism, without structuralism it is nothing. Appending would imply that structuralism was dead and buried, but this would be the last thing Derrida would say. Indeed, I imagine he would have rejected the use of for any school of thought in philosophy, because it would imply that what came before was irrelevant or inferior, which would stand in opposition to his idea that philosophy is essentially a genealogy, a taxonomy of ideas in which every idea or school of thought is significant and serves to define its precedents and antecedents. 

Whatever else Nietzsche was, he was aware of Christian texts. Jesus once prominently said that "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." (Matthew 18:3 $URL$ ) Nietzsche was making an amplification or re-working of a somewhat mystical Bible doctrine which Jesus does go on to explain. 

The writer of this sentence has not defined meaningless to mean objectively meaningless, and he has done nothing to define bad or goodness, so it is like comparing apples-and-oranges when we ask whether something may have objective good quality even though it "is" meaningless. Suppose the writer of the sentence actually believes that meaning in life is derived from productivity. Thus a sad, self-hating factory worker who is a full-time internet troll has lots of productivity goodness as long as he doesn't fail to tighten those two bolts whenever they pass his station on the assembly line. (A reference to Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times) Maybe this goodness is enough for him to have objective quality! But if the writer of the sentence is an internet moderator whose purpose is to sell advertising to companies that don't like to see vitriol next to their detergent ads, then that same sad factory worker doesn't have goodness no matter how productive he is at work. This doesn't sound good enough for him to have objective quality after all. I can impose any such value on "goodness", since the author did not define it. Of the three things quality, goodness, and meaning, meaning is getting fully defined here. Quality is also getting a strong treatment. But the author is starving the definition of goodness such that his argument fails to hit the mark with me. I just end up skeptical. It is my own synthesis that people get meaning from an authority in their lives. If you give that authority to a skillful book author, then he can assign you meaning. Great! But does the author have your best interests? Maybe he's using ambiguous words and suggestion to manipulate you into selling your stocks when the market is low, so he can buy 'em. Or maybe he's trying to get you to buy shares in Florida swampland ETFs, which he is selling. How could you know? 

I can imagine that it may often be difficult for responses on philosophy.stackexchange to be correctly called 'answers' since there must always be room for interpretation and evaluation in philosophical matters, but allow me to give you my views on your question and from it perhaps you will be able to discover an answer for yourself if not for everyone. Continental philosophy has profoundly—albeit misguidedly—influenced art, literature and film throughout the world. Analytic philosophy has inspired developments in mathematics and computer science, shaped the scientific method, and informed quantitative approaches to psychology and sociology. Both branches have elicited developments in linguistics. What continental philosophy has not done is continue developing in its original spirit; even since Sartre, continental philosophy has rather begun to regress or become blended with analytic flavours, with such notions as embodiment blending ideas from Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and others. Conversely, analytic philosophy has continued developing in the same way but in increasingly insignificant increments as it gradually cedes much of its original lines of inquiry to the sciences. This is the primary distinction between the two branches of philosophy: analytic philosophy walks hand in hand with science and scientism; continental philosophy focuses on the poetic and metaphysical understanding of the world. Analytic philosophy divides the world into subject and object; continental philosophy seeks to unite observer and observed to reach a fundamental and unbounded picture of both. Analytic philosophy seeks to simplify philosophy through demarcation, whilst continental philosophy is concerned with questions that are intuitively more fundamental even than science or logic. Analytic philosophy might be said to have had the more profound influence in contemporary academic circles, but what does that actually mean? Analytic philosophy has no purpose, because its goals are either impossible or fall to scientific endeavours to complete. Continental philosophy has arguably seen less academic attention (or at least less academic understanding/improvement) but the ideas of phenomenology, existentialism and deconstruction have disseminated globally and inspired vast amounts of creative work—though often the ideas are distorted or misinterpreted in such works, as is usually the case when an academic concept reaches the populace. Judging which branch of contemporary philosophy has had the more profound influence will depend on what you personally think is more profound: the sciences or the humanities. Or perhaps not, if you think as I think: that analytic philosophy is not philosophy at all, but rather an auditing process for scientific enterprise. Continental philosophy represents, to me, a truer philosophy, especially through Heidegger and the break with the Cartesian tradition of subject/object opposition and through Derrida's subsequent refinement of destruktion as deconstruction. Within the academic discipline of philosophy itself, it is difficult to judge which branch had the more profound impact. Philosophy finds itself in troubled water these days, unsure of whether it is a science or an art; you will find academics undertaking scientific studies of a psychological/neurological character calling it philosophy, and likewise you will find people still agonising over Aristotle, Chrysippus, Kant, Hegel, Husserl, and so on—and as Derrida certainly demonstrated, no philosophers will truly lose their significance, because their ideas were defined and remain defined by their opposition to each other and to the times, and that these definitions are traces of a genealogy of meaning that will not end. We might say that Continental philosophy affirms philosophy as a subject and gives it life, paves the way for future study and creation. In contrast, analytic philosophy might be said to be less constructive, narrowing philosophy down according to scientific standards over which philosophy ought to preside. I do not mean to say that analytic philosophy is only logical positivism, but analytic philosophers do not do what philosophers must by definition do: question themselves and their methods. 

According to Wikipedia, it would be helpful to frame the conflict between nominalism and realism according to the problem of universals, which might be stated thusly: 

I came up with a list of things that good music communicates. I'll repeat it here: Beauty Emotion (or drama) Imitation (of nature) Bigness (or awe) Virtuosity (of the performer) Practical social functions (like dance or work songs) Unifying social functions (like anthems) Memory (or recognition) 

1: Information can't come out of a black hole. (Relativity) 2: Information can't be lost. (Quantum mechanics) 3: Black holes eventually disappear. (Hawking radiation) ABSURD: Where's the information? 

You might be pleased to learn that this was the subject of the most popular allegory by Socrates recorded by Plato: the allegory of the cave. Socrates describes people imprisoned in a cave, separated from the opening by a big rock which nevertheless admits some light inside. The light shows shadows on the inside of the cave, like a camera obscura. The people can't leave, and they can't turn around. Everything they see is shadows. According to Plato, this is what real life is like: everything we see gives us in impression of real things (or what he calls "forms"), but we really don't see forms. 

I'll try! Free will is when you, the YOU that isn't anything else and isn't any property or sum of your parts... free will is when you are the cause of your actions. We believe that you cause your actions because of moral praise and blame. If you did it, and it was great, then you should get some praise for that. If you did it and it was bad, then you should be blamed for that. But if you didn't do it, that is, if your doing it was not caused by YOU, then why would anybody blame you for what happened, or praise you either? Just for fun, here are some people who had/have free will: Abraham Lincoln, Charles Darwin, Chris Hitchens, Jane Goodall, Martin Luther King Jr., Barack Obama, Copernicus, Leonardo da Vinci, Winston Churchill, Steve Jobs, Pol Pot, Ghengis Khan, Benito Mussolini, Josef Stalin, and Harvey Weinstein. 

Preamble Your fears are regrettably well-founded. Unlike mathematical logic, the philosophy of language is not so clear cut and remains to this day a deeply controversial topic. There are a dozen schools of thought on the philosophy of language, both classical and contemporary. It is a fundamental and unquestionably significant field of philosophical inquiry, but unfortunately what appears as a stream of simple concepts that should be amenable to science soon reveals itself as an inconsistent web of increasingly intricate questions and facts rapidly give way to opinions. The philosophy of language divided, and continues to divide, the analytic philosophers—who are known for their predilection for rigour, valid method and proof. While I would love to hand you a shiny Cambridge or Springer text in the philosophy of language, I am afraid there is no definitive work. There are commentaries and historical discussions but these will not suffice at all. What I recommend instead is this: if you are sufficiently intrigued and if you have the time to spare, read through the texts I have listed below, which come straight from the field's most significant philosophers themselves. For if it is not possible to find an objective and rigorous account of something, one must build an internal consensus for themselves, generating an objective account from a rigorous treatment of the intersubjective account.

This indicates already that to be any of these things, you need to think for yourself and you need to think in a certain way. Your thinking needs to become structured, not to preclude novel, out of the box approaches to problems but to enable you to understand what you are learning in your own terms, rather than simply memorising somebody else's terms. The Socratic Method is ideal because, as I said, as an instructor you will appeal to your students to think about how to solve a problem and the only way they will arrive at the correct answer is to think like a philosopher, computer scientist or mathematician. The further advantage with the Socratic Method is that you will require your students to justify their answer, so even if they happen on the correct answer or a strong thesis, they have to understand why it is correct or strong in order to be right. Thus when a student gives an incorrect answer, you reply with an explanation of the flaws in their logic and they will have a blueprint for how to improve; when a student answers correctly, they are made aware of the fact that their thinking was correct and that they should refine and apply their way of thinking to future questions. In epistemological terms, you can view the Socratic Method as a way of embedding procedural knowledge in your students, rather than making them memorise propositional knowledge. In computer science terms, you are giving students imperative knowledge rather than declarative knowledge. You are not just feeding them definitions and rules from which they would be lucky to intuit the abstract nature of the subject at hand; you are not even just giving them a recipe or an instruction set leading to the correct answer for them to analyse. You are making the students think about how to formulate such a recipe and inviting them to challenge rules, to play Devil's advocate, all for the purpose of being wrong. Obviously some people possess natural talents, truly intuitive grasps of subjects like mathematics, but the Socratic Method appeals to all students. It refines the students who are already adept and it brings the uninitiated up to speed by forcing them to make mistakes. If we do not grasp something intuitively, we learn by trial and error, and what better way to force trial and error than to ask your students to give answers before being comprehensively shown how to answer? They will make mistakes and they will learn from them. Once you have students thinking for themselves, you can expect for your students to eventually challenge you—the definition of a great teacher according to Aristotle: 

History may help us understand better... One reason is that the most powerful empire in recent memory, the British Empire, was explicitly Christian. When anti-imperial forces (think Ghandi) became more popular in the mid-20th Century, they reasonably associated being Christian with unjust authority. Also, since the 1850s or so, Western Europe and parts of the US have been intellectually led by folks like Freud and Darwin who sought to contradict the claims of the Bible, such as purposeful creation and historical miracles. Lastly, since the 1960s youth movements (May '68 in Paris, Free Speech Movement in Berkeley, and elsewhere) there has been much more public acceptance of highly-desirable media and items which Christian teaching prohibits for Christians, such as pornography. 

When person A says to person B, "You're being irrational," is it fair for person A to mean the following? 

My favorite source of philosophical and Christian quotes, William Lane Craig, has this to say about J.P. Moreland: 

Unfortunately, if there were such a right as the right to dignified death by assisted suicide, it would inevitably come into conflict with the right of doctors to practice medicine according to their personal ethic. In the US, many doctors make a ceremonial oath when they begin to practice which is called the "Hippocratic Oath". It has changed from time to time since it was written in the days of Plato and Socrates, but its core is the same: "First do no harm." Every doctor either does or does not call it "doing no harm" to assist a person who wishes to kill him- or herself. In your example, if no doctors were available who see it this way, who has the authority to force some doctor to "do harm"?
