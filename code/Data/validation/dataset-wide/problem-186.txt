The soil is bad, it won't sustain the sorts of crops your settlers grow. The soil is too rocky/sandy/salty/clayey/marshy/whatever. The details will depend on what crops are popular. Alternately, grasslands don't have to be 100% flat. Maybe there's lots of broken terrain, sinkholes, gulleys, etc. Alternately, your settlers don't value farming. They make their living from the sea, aren't very good at growing crops, don't keep cattle. They would consider grasslands to be uninteresting. 

Objects in mirror are closer than they appear. Disclaimer: This post consists predominantly of statements that sound cool, but have only the thinnest relationship with reality. This will not work in real life. Gravitational lensing is a phenomonon by which a huge mass bends light, thereby distorting the apparent location of an object. Astronomers in real life have used this effect as a space magnifying glass to see distant galaxies. If your aliens could create micro black holes, or maybe they actually ARE micro black holes, they could theoretically use this light bending trick as a side view mirror. By bending light towards themselves, and calculating the amount of distortion in the image, they could plausibly have some degree of vision. Note there would still be some lag time - They could see where an object WAS and then make an educated guess as where it IS, but I don't think you could pull off real-time sight with this trick. You would have to accelerate/bend the light to go faster than the speed of light, which would be tough. Although...this post is describing FTL aliens using portable dark matter as a sensor array. So if you want to make the effect real-time, I don't think that's much more of a stretch. They also wouldn't be able to see directly behind themselves. Their blind spot cone would widen in relation to how much beyone lightspeed they were traveling. At least, that sounds right to me...I am not a scientist. Bibliography: I used the Gravity's Lens article from One Minute Astronomer as research for this post. $URL$ I also used a lifetime of listening to quasi-scientific Star Trek tech explanations to make it sound good. 

If your goal is to explain the cities were build by men like you and him, not gods, you could mention the graveyards and funeral houses in a city. You need to explain the limits of those who build the cities so you can show the builders were not gods. If your goal is to show off the technology, build something that the tribe cannot deny the usefulness of and explain something they have no explanation for. If your character does this and the tribe is concerned about this, what then? Using more technology would be like opening a Pandora's box for them. They could say, "Embracing this would lead to same destruction of the gods." You will need to build trust with them to convince your path is the right one. 

If there is a shortage of nitrogen or the agricultural needs for nitrogen overwhelms the needs for guns, then you cannot product enough bullets so bows and arrows make more sense. You could change the chemistry of your world so nitrogen do not lead to explosions. 

The rate of fire for siege weapons is not high enough for attacking mass troops. A fast cavalry charge could overrun a bank of ballistas. English longbows could shoot down charging horses because a large group of English bowmen could send up a cloud of arrows fast enough and far enough to stop a charge. $URL$ 

I have some questions about this system. When you go into a new body how much are you yourself? After every transfer, you could have the same memories but will you feel different about them? The same action in one body may feel wrong in another body. A piece of music you love as human can evoke displeasure as an elf. Is the experience between different races the same? Can the races interbreed? Will one spouse hope to be an elf so they can have half-elf children with their other human spouse? What are the rules for establishing identify after the change? Must there be witnesses to the change to verify identify? Will the government accept that? Will your family and friends? When you become a member of the new race, will the members of new race accept you? Although getting traits are random, what is possibility that after the change the person in question looks like someone else? You wrote the system generates some attributes randomly. Who controls that system? Can that system be hacked to commit fraud or force certain attributes? Can you change back up if you try it and do not like it? 

Are you familiar with the history of the Ford Pinto? It was a car sold in the 70s. If the vehicle was rear-ended, the gas tank tended to explode. Getting to your question - Space travel is a complicated engineering challenge. Engineers struggled for millenia on how to get an economically efficient engine able to power a spaceship at a reasonable rate of speed. It was eventually accomplished, but are still some design problems that haven’t been worked out yet. Those spaceship engines don’t like to be jostled. And when they are jostled, as they would be if someone was foolish enough to shoot at them, the results are...bad. When those engines go, it isn’t just bad news for that ship’s crew. Other nearby ships tend to suffer as well. It’s rumored that, hypothetically, a bad enough reaction could create a new black hole. So DON’T SHOOT THE SHIPS!!! addendum to address some of the excellent points raised below: I think a catastrophic failure could affect ships even if they were a million miles away. Ships won’t be sitting still while they’re being shot. They will be moving around. So all that mass is moving in one direction. The power core has enough juice to move all that mass at faster-than-light speeds. Perhaps, if an enemy laser knocks out the regulators on the power core BEFORE doing enough damage to the engines to render them inoperable, all that energy spikes through the engines. The ship (already damaged) suddenly gets pushed into an uncontrolled FTL speed. Catastrophic structure failure is likely. Then you have less of a ship and more of an FTL shotgun. That could plausibly have negative consequences to an enemy ship no matter how far away they were. Also, regarding the comments on the Ford Pinto being more of a hysteria problem, that’s a good point. Humans can get fixated on dramatic, spectacular negative outcomes even if they are extremely unlikely. Which adds to my point. It doesn’t matter if it is LIKELY that a catastrophic engine failure can wipe out another ship a million miles away. All that matters is it’s POSSIBLE. It will be on every crew’s mind every single time someone gives the order to fire. Which, in turn, makes boarding actions much more attractive. 

For one thing, action has units, so you can't add $1$ to it as you do in the denominator. But that's easily worked around by replacing the $1$ with a constant $h_M$. From there, let me simplify your expression by writing the modified action as $$S = S^{(L)} + \frac{S^{(M)}}{h_M + \lvert S^{(L)}\rvert}$$ According to the stationary action principle, you need the variation $\delta S = 0$ for physical paths. Variation basically follows the same rules as derivatives, so $$\delta S = \delta S^{(L)} + \frac{\delta S^{(M)}}{h_M + \lvert S^{(L)}\rvert} \pm \frac{S^{(M)}}{(h_M + \lvert S^{(L)}\rvert)^2}\delta S^{(L)}$$ The $\pm$ sign, resulting from your use of the absolute value, is already a clue that this is going to get fairly complicated. I won't bother to explain the sign choice in detail, but it does bring up the related issue of a sort of "gauge dependence" of your action: the fact that adding a constant to the action changes the equations of motion. In standard Lagrangian mechanics, you can add any value representable as $f(t_2) - f(t_1)$, for some differentiable function $f$, to the action with no effect on the underlying physics. This property is essential in deriving the Euler-Lagrange equations. In your case, however, significant changes could result from adding that kind of term. That sign choice, for instance, depends on whether $S^{(L)}$ is positive or negative. So let's do the following: 

There are fewer particles to hit in intergalactic space This would require the energy released from the formation of an entire galaxy to somehow be concentrated in a single particle 

Traveling at $0.7c$, it will take the Problem $\frac{48.6\ \mathrm{ly}}{0.7c} = 69.4\ \text{years}$ after the encounter to reach ship B, of which 50 years have already passed, so they have $19.4\ \text{years}$ left to prepare when ship A returns. And at that time, the Problem will be $0.7c\times 19.4\ \text{years} = 13.6\ \mathrm{ly}$ away. 

1There do exist chemical reactions that release energy but don't occur spontaneously, usually because they require a small input of energy or a catalyst to get started. But you're not going to get these from building materials. They occur in combustible or explosive substances.
