What, exactly, are the papers that the judge had signed, and why did her ex-husband have them? Is this referring to divorce papers, or some other papers that the ex-husband had acquired? Also, does the line that "He shot me once, but I shot him twice" imply that this was also self-defense, or was the main character the instigator here? If the main character really was acting in self-defense and/or defense of her like he claimed, why did he think that he would go to prison over the incident? 

We don't actually hear all that much about Mr. Weatherby after this, so the text doesn't directly answer this. There are only a few references to him later in the book: Jim Taggart referred to him in passing during his meeting with Lillian Rearden, and he appeared at a dinner meeting about the state of the railroad industry. Interestingly, the book notes of the party that Clem Weatherby was the least influential person at the dinner in spite of (or, perhaps, because of) being the technical expert on railroads. (Dagny was, of course, only there so that they could pretend that she agreed with their decisions). Also, it was Jim Taggart (not Clem Weatherby) that convinced her to attend the meeting in the first place. While the text doesn't specify either way, this at least hints at the possibility that Mr. Weatherby either wasn't successful in trading Dagny (which would make sense given her prediction that trying to trade her probably wouldn't do him any good) or that he didn't try in the first place. 

The Tales of Goldstone Wood series is notorious for non-chronological writing, and the publication order doesn't at all reflect "in-universe" time. What is the proper chronological order of the books in the series? Is there any reason to read them in publication order (rather than chronological order)? 

Is this song comparable to "Hotel California" in a way - you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave ("No chance of escape")? Or am I missing the point? 

When Dagney Taggart spent time in the Valley, she asked to be allowed to attend John Galt's lectures on physics. He refused on the grounds that he didn't want to give her information or ideas that could be used to help people on the outside, and that all of his students had a practical need for it (implication: she didn't). Some of his students included (among others) Dwight Sanders (formerly an aircraft manufacturer), Ted Nielsen (formerly a motor manufacturer), Quentin Daniels (professional physicist), and Owen Kellogg (formerly a manager for Taggert Transcontinental). Most of those make perfect sense - physics has obvious applications to manufacturing aircraft and motors. I don't understand what Owen Kellogg would do with the information, though; also, it seems like if it was useful for Owen Kellogg, it would be equally useful for Dagney (which John Galt strongly implies that it's not). Not wanting to give her information that could be helpful to outsiders before she had joined them makes perfect sense, but why the practicality objection? Why was Owen Kellogg on the list of people who had a practical use for the information but she wasn't? 

In Catch-22, Dunbar would routinely cultivate boredom in an effort to extend his life. Why did he consider that worthwhile? Why did he want a long but boring life? 

At least some of the plot emphasis probably reflects the underlying text: really, the text only mentions the coat twice: first, when Jacob gave it to him (Genesis 37:3), secondly, when Joseph visits his brothers while wearing it (v. 23), and third when Joseph's brothers sell him into slavery, dye the tunic with goat's blood, and bring it to their father as "evidence" that he was killed by wild animals (v. 31 - 33). The primary reason that the text even mentions it in the first place is as an illustration of Jacob's blatant favoritism (which was a major factor in his brothers' jealousy), and so that the brothers could use it later to fake Joseph's death: 

What, exactly, is "it"? What does Jack do again? Is it the thing named in the previous verse - i.e. the guy kills again after he gets off for the first murder, continues to be in relationships with women he knows are bad for him, and continues to gamble after swearing it off? 

Once the characters in No Exit realized that they were placed there to torment each other, why didn't they refuse to do so? When Joseph says "eh bien, continuons" ("very well, let's get on with it") at the end, is he implicitly consenting to participate in this? What's the significance of his agreement (or at least lack of refusal) in Sartre's overall philosophy? In the context of the story (and Sartre's philosophy), could the characters possibly have refused and what might have happened if they had? 

Why did she react that way to seeing the Mills? Why did intensifying it "seem to make her helpless and silent"? Admittedly, she never could've matched his genius (a fact that she was well aware of), but then again, neither could Eddie Willers. Eddie Willers openly admitted that he couldn't match Dagney or Hank Reardon's talent, and yet he's a thoroughly moral character. Why is it that Eddie's respect for talent make him moral, and yet Lillian's (apparent) admiration of the Mills made her seem "helpless and silent"? Why did she react that way to the Mills in the first place, and why didn't she continue to express admiration for the Mills later in the book? 

Highway 61 is an actual highway that goes north from New Orleans and ends up in Minnesota. Why did Dylan choose this particular highway, and how does it affect how we understand the song lyrics? 

It depends on what you mean by "all along." Snape was actually working for Voldemort, and then after he realized that Voldemort intended to kill the Potters he became loyal to Dumbledore and (apparently) remained so for the rest of his life. (His actions in the sixth book were entirely taken in an effort to re-establish his cover with the Death Eaters, not out of disloyalty to Dumbledore). After Snape accidentally referred to Lily as a mudblood and attempted to apologize, Lily said 

First, as a disclaimer, I actually don't agree with objectivism, but I'll try to summarize her position/arguments here. I think that this represents at least some of the arguments and claims that she may have advanced in responding to this question. With that said, I don't think that she's ignoring "ideal" altruism. I think that the books probably would've been more balanced if not all of the altruists were so unambiguously evil, but I think that that's not exactly the same thing as saying that she's ignoring "ideal" altruism. For what it's worth, there are actually some altruistic characters in her books who aren't entirely evil, just mistaken. (Consider, for example, Dan Conway in Atlas Shrugged, who is presented in a largely positive light even though he agrees with at least some of the altruists' basic moral premises). From the perspective of objectivism, though, altruism is evil, regardless of the character or motivations of the individuals who are practicing it. In other words, she's not ignoring "ideal" altruism - she's saying that it doesn't exist. Every case that people point to to justify altruism either isn't actually altruism (addressed below) or isn't actually good. Sacrifice, including self-sacrifice, are specifically not noble pursuits from her perspective. To quote from The Objectivist Ethic: 

Shortly after he was expelled from the Stanton Institute of Technology, Hoard Roark has the following encounter with Mrs. Keating: 

What exactly was he gaining from his racket (other than getting power by having a stranglehold on the Unification Board)? 

(It cites Ayn Rand's journals as a source for these claims, which I unfortunately do not have access to at this time). In what way was Stadler based on Oppenheimer? Since Stadler's defining characteristic was being the man that knew better, did Ayn Rand view Oppenheimer in the same way? What did Oppenheimer know better than to do - work on nuclear weapons? (Wikipedia seems to imply as much). If so, why did she oppose his involvement with that? I can see how Project X was analogous to nuclear weapons in one sense, but Dr. Stadler was only loosely aware of the project (although he was admittedly ignorant largely by his own choice) whereas Oppenheimer personally supervised the research into the nuclear bomb, so does this analogy "break down" at some point? What's the exact nature of the analogy between Stadler and Oppenheimer? Is Wikipedia's assessment of the analogy accurate? 

Since Dagny wouldn't ask it, I will - why did they make all their crucial decisions at parties? Elsewhere in the book (I think it's at Jim Taggart's wedding), it's mentioned that parties were at least partially a way to tell who was able to manipulate whom. Is there a connection? 

While the Cocteau Twins are known for their mumbled lyrics (to the point that there's sometimes debate about exactly what's being sung), the song Heaven or Las Vegas (from the album of the same name) clearly and repeatedly contrasts Las Vegas with heaven ("But is it Heaven or Las Vegas?" --- "Is it Heaven or Las Vegas?" --- etc.). Why are these seen as somehow contrasting? Is there any significance to picking Las Vegas in particular for this contrast (or is it just the fact that the name happened to fit, like Winslow, AZ was in Take it Easy by The Eagles)? 

Unfortunately for the author of the article, the quote is from Voldemort, the arch-villain of the book. That being the case, it's safe to assume that the author completely disagrees with the sentiment; you could quote this as an example of something that the author does not believe. There are numerous other examples of quotes from characters that the author would almost certainly disagree with. Point being that just because a character in a book said something doesn't mean that the author agrees with the sentiment; there are just too many counterexamples for that to even be a serious idea. (I don't think that that's what you were suggesting in your question, just wanted to throw that out there). With regards to the specific quote you mention, a lot of times Albus Dumbledore is, in fact, a "mouthpiece" for the author. Just as there are cases where a character (like Voldemort) delivers stuff that the author clearly disagrees with, there are also cases where characters are clearly serving as "mouthpieces" of the author in a sense. For example, it's pretty clear that C. S. Lewis would agree with anything that Aslan says in the Chronicles of Narnia. He's an "unrestricted"/unqualified "mouthpiece" for the author in the sense that anything Aslan says C. S. Lewis also says. A character can also serve as a "mouthpiece" in specific circumstances or on particular topics. For example, in Harry Potter, Hermoine Granger is often a "mouthpiece" for the author in terms of factual information about the in-series universe (e.g. the properties of the Sword of Gryffindor), so we can assume that she's speaking for the author on factual questions. We can't necessarily assume that she's speaking for the author on other topics, though. Albus Dumbledore may be such a character. When he's speaking on topics like, for example, morality or philosophy, he generally says stuff that the author seems likely to agree with. I'm sure you can find counterexamples, but it seems relatively safe to assume that the character's generally speaking for the author on those topics (obviously subject to the context). So, the extent to which the author is likely to agree with a character is determined by the context as well as the author's statements on the topic. 

Is there any evidence that Mr. Weatherby tried to "cash in" on this connection? It doesn't seem like there's all that much contact between them later in the book (apart from a dinner that they were both at, and Dagny was mostly there so that they could pretend that she agreed with their decision). 

When Dagny crashes in Galt's Gulch, we learn that Ellis Wyatt has been experimenting with new ways of producing oil. However, there's no textual evidence that he was researching new applications of oil (unlike Hank Rearden, who actively researches new applications for his metal). Here's the problem: the main applications of oil are engines of various kind (diesel engines, airplane engines, car motors). John Galt's motor obsoleted oil-burning engines; there's absolutely no reason that you'd ever develop anything but an electric motor. The fact that John developed the prototypes of the motor while he was at the 20th Century Motor Company, it seems likely that it was likely originally intended for use as part of car engines. Dagny pointed out that it could be used to replace a lot of other existing motors, too, such as engines for trains. Also, the existence of Rearden Metal would drastically reduced energy consumption anyway because it was so much lighter than steel. For example, Hank Rearden told Dagny that he wanted to eventually make planes out of his metal. I suppose that oil is also used in plastic manufacturing, it's currently not the primary source of raw material for plastic making in the U.S.. According to the linked article, 

Hugh Akston stated that, when he first met John Galt, John asked a question on Plato's metaphysics that he would've been proud to get from someone who had studied philosophy for six years, a question that Plato didn't have the sense to ask himself. What was the question (or what might it have been)? 

Philip Rearden later demanded that Hank give him a job. During the course of their discussion, he stated: 

Closely related: Accuracy of a translation: how to forge an opinion? Several authors, such as Samuel Beckett, periodically translated their own works. Are their translations generally regarded as accurate? Do people tend to find them more - or less - trustworthy than translations done by professional translators? Have there been any examples of authors who did translations that included major changes to the work?
