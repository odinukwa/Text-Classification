I remember which way to go by turning the pedal wrench toward the back of the bike because to undo the pedal, you have to go backward. To tighten the pedals, turn it toward the front because once you have the pedals on, you can go forward. 

My grandpa gave me his old 1974 Raleigh International (all original Campy) as a graduation present. Since the stock wheels are for tubular tires, and I do want to ride it around town, I want to get wheels for clincher tires so I can change the inner tube when I flat rather than having to mess with glue jobs. A new rear wheel means that I can have an option of getting a rear wheel with shimano hyperglide so I can choose modern cassettes. Because the shifters are friction shifters rather than indexed shifters, does it matter how many cogs are in the cassette? Do I have to stick with 5 or could I even go to 10? I stand corrected that the frame is steel and not alumninum. I was mistaken because the bike is significantly lighter than other steel-framed bikes I have dealt with. I apologize for this error. 

Therefore, if WD-40 isn't doing the trick, get some ammonia, apply it in a similar fashion, and let it sit. It may just be all you need! 

Dérailleurs exist not only to change gears, but to add tension to the chain as well. If you are noticing chain slack, and nothing else has changed or been replaced, the reason for chain slack is that the dérailleur has lost this ability. This could be for a few reasons: 

This seems like an example of 'if it's broke, don't fix it'... I understand how it might be bothersome or annoying, but modern shifters such as these are relatively complex and can be easily 'messed-up'. That said, the best solution I could find is the manufacturer's maintenance manuals, which is somewhat lacking. Unfortunately I don't think there are many people who've worked on this specific shifter that can answer your question. 

In investment casting, the steel is allowed to settle into its final shape while it's hot and allowed to slowly cool. This means that in it's final form, the metal is under absolutely zero stress trying to maintain it's shape. Furthermore, it ensures very even distribution (for example, rolled steel may be thin on the convex side and thick on the concave side). 

Communication is key. I have a cowbell I attach to my bike when riding on trails so people know that a bike is coming. Or that a cow is speeding toward them. Either way, the trails I go on are vacant, save for the occasional hiker, and they're often courteous enough to move off the trail in order to let me go by. I thank them as I pass by because hikers do have the right of way. When hikers hold their ground, I have to clip out, go to the side of the singletrack path, and then lean my bike as far as I can toward the brush so the hikers can get by my handlebar. Is it bothersome to yield to hikers? Absolutely. But I think crashing into someone is worse. Especially with all the lawyers here in California. 

Remove the tire, innertube, and rim tape from the wheel. Using a spoke wrench, loosen and remove the nipples. If you are using the same spokes, remove the spokes from the old hub. Lace the wheel, making ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that the valve will be in the right place. Check out Sheldon Brown's step-by-step wheelbuilding page for the procedure of lacing a 3x (three-cross) wheel. You will want to use a little bit of vaseline on the threads of each spoke so you can tighten the nipples more easily. Go to a nearby bicycle cooperative (you can google bicycle co-op near nameofyourtown) to use a truing stand, and use the truing stand to adjust the wheel. Make sure the wheel is dished properly and that you have proper tension on the spokes. 

Rubber rim strip is pretty stretchy stuff--and you want it to fit snugly! Therefore, if buying rubber the diameter of your rim strip is not nearly as important as the width. It should cover all the spoke nipples and/or the large holes drilled for the spokes, and fit well along the rim. That said, your local shop should have some in a size that fits 26" rims best. Alternatively, there are brands of rim strip which are not one continuous piece and are not rubber, but instead are similar to thick tape. It's important to note the thickness--electrical tape may work in a pinch (and after a couple layers) but it's not nearly as resilient. This type of rim strip is basically one-size-fits all and is generally considered higher quality that the rubber type. 

This is pretty unconventional and not necessarily available to you, but here's some food for thought. Friends of mine had had a custom 'rack' built for their Kona Ute by a local rack & frame-builder to transport their two daughters (although they are much older). It came out exceptionally well (plus the girls love it): 

There is one other aspect that has not yet been addressed: shifters. Shimano and SRAM use different technologies for the rear derailleur. Most SRAM has a 1:1 actuation ratio, which means that the length of cable moved by the shifters is identical to the horizontal movement of the derailleur. However, all Shimano uses a 2:1 actuation ratio, which means that twice as much cable has to be moved as horizontal movement of the derailleur. If you have Shimano shifters, you must get a Shimano rear derailleur. But if you have SRAM shifters that are X-series (X-4, X-5, X-7, X-9, X-0), you must get a SRAM rear derailleur. This is a concern only for the rear derailleur and not for the front derailleur. 

From my experience racing USAC Collegiate xc and short track, disc brakes are the way to go, and I prefer hydraulic to mechanical, as long as they're the right model. You can find a lot of reviews on the mtbr.com forum about disc brakes to find one that would work for you. The Avid Elixir R SLs I use on my full-suspension mtb have never let me down and are easy to adjust. From general riding experience, disc brakes are much more responsive in dusty and wet situations than v-brakes are. Disc brakes provide another advantage during race situations: If you flat during a race, you just have to flip your bike over, open the quick-release and pull the wheel off. Since disc brakes don't go around the tire like rim brakes do, you don't have to disengage or reengage the brakes when you pull the wheel off or put it back on. Also if you're running rim brakes and you hit a rock during a race that makes your wheel go out of true, your rim will be hitting the brake pads while you ride, which can end your hopes of placing. With disc brakes, your braking power is not affected by the trueness of the wheel. You'll probably want to true the wheel when you get back to your tent, but your race isn't over if you're running discs. 

The easiest way to see why investment casting is preferable is to compare it to the alternative ways the same items can be made: (modified from here) 

They are formed into a different shape from a cold, pre-formed piece of metal (Stamped, Bulge, Machined/CNC'd), thereby reducing strength, or They have some weak spot (Rolled, Welding/Brazing), thereby reducing strength. 

You're absolutely right--children's bicycles with training wheels are good for exercise and entertainment, but they do little to nothing for balance. In my experience, the best way to teach anyone--children included--to ride a bicycle is to take the pedals off, lower the seat, and let them scoot & coast around until they develop the proper balance. Then, add the pedals, and let them coast, pedal, etc. For children, there are several popular brand that makes 'run bikes', which are usually made out of wood, and have neither training wheels nor pedals. They are low enough that the child can sit in the saddle and place both feet on the ground, but high enough that they can still propel themselves & lift their feet to coast. These bikes allow the child to quickly and safely develop good bicycle balance. (See $URL$ $URL$ and $URL$ 

Always be careful about carbon fiber and collisions. Carbon fiber is light and strong, but it's very fragile and can break unexpectedly because you can't always see the cracks. In one of my collegiate mtb short track races, a guy snapped his carbon fiber handlebar at the stem after a 1' drop because the handlebar took abuse over time. When it lost all strength, the effect on the equipment was catastrophic. So in your case, if the crash was strong enough to throw you over the hood of the car to the other side, it probably messed up the carbon fork, even if you can't see it. When riding bikes, I've found the fork to be particularly useful, so certainly have the fork checked out, but be prepared to junk it for your own safety. 

I have found grip shifts to have more problems over time than trigger shifters. If you plan on riding this particular bike for several years, I recommend swapping out the revoshift in favor of comparably priced shimano trigger shifters. Since you are even considering taking apart the shifter, I believe you will be able to install new shifters, cables and housing. Remember that new cables will stretch quickly, so if you choose to change shifters, be prepared to adjust the cable lengths after the first couple rides. If you would like to fix the shifter you have, make sure to take a picture of the shifter mechanism when you open it up before starting to work on it. Then make an outline of what you see on a piece of paper and tape to it the screws you remove in their respective locations. Make new such outlines for each level of shifter as you remove more pieces. This way you can avoid losing tiny screws and springs and other pieces and you will know what goes where when you try to reassemble the shifter. 

I think the investment casting of the entire headtube is something particular to BMX bikes. It makes sense, for reasons outlined below. Typical parts of a bicycle which can be investment-cast are: 

I have this problem myself. Take it as a compliment from your bike--it means you're capable of putting a lot of torque/power through the rear wheel! For me, the solution was to do what you've been doing--clamp down and take your wheel off sparingly. A better solution would be to purchase a quick release skewer with a rougher interface with the dropout. It might chew up the surface and your paint a little bit, but it will help prevent slippage. 

Since Shimano square-taper cranks are J.I.S. (not low-profile), this means that all Phil Wood bottom brackets with JIS spindles are compatible, as well as Outboard Bottom Brackets. 

When riding long distances, either solo or with groups of people, it is obviously necessary to carry a first-aid kit in case of a crash or other injury. What are the most important items to pack, while still considering weight or space? What items can be included in 'travel-size', and which items should be 'full-size'? What items should definitely be left at home? 

I think if you are willing to spend a few hours, it's worth doing yourself. Depending on the flange size of the new hub, though, you may need to buy new spokes. You can determine the length of the spokes you will need using a spoke length calculator. You will need a spoke wrench, a flat-head screwdriver, some vaseline, and the use of a truing stand. Here's what you'll have to do: 

The 2000 miles is an estimate of when the chain will stretch. Your chain may last longer than that. As far as replacing it goes, I think it depends on your financial situation. If you can easily afford a new chain, I recommend buying one. A replaced chain means that you don't have to worry about your current chain stretching beyond the limit and damaging your bike. If your budget makes buying a new chain difficult, you'll be all right to keep riding. Just check the chain stretch every so often to determine when it's getting near absolutely necessary to buy a chain. 

I have had SPDs and eggbeaters, and I love the Crank Bros eggbeater pedals. I've found them to be way better than SPDs. You can clip in on four sides rather than two, and in my experience, they're easier to clip out of in emergency situations than SPDs are. Also, unlike SPDs, eggbeaters don't have flat surfaces, so you're less likely to slip off if you're trying to get back on after hike-a-bike sections of muddy trails. 

The best method for handling exterior frame rust depends on how much time you'd like to invest. The difference comes down to what you use to complete the two basic steps: 

In the past, when I commuted to a job without showers (I've managed to luck out recently) I made sure to: 

New pads. After a bit of wear (or sandpapering), the squealing will stop. Misalignment. As some others have mentioned, misalignment may cause squealing (although it would be reduced with some wear). Check out Sheldon Brown's tips for alignment suggestions. Oil or water on the rim. Either of these substances, even in small portions, combined with dirt or debris on the rim can create squealing. Wipe the rims thoroughly on the braking surface, as well as the pads, with a dry cloth. Incompatible rims/pads. No one else has mentioned this, but this is often the most common cause. Rims are generally made from one of two materials: steel or alloy. (You can tell the difference by seeing if a magnet will attract (steel) or not (alloy)). Incidentally, brake pads are made of specific compounds to work on one or the other. Often, using pads designed for alloy rims (like most Kool-Stops) will squeal if used on steel (which I'm guessing you have). 

External bottom brackets have been appearing on higher-end bikes in the last few years. Can older bikes with bottom bracket shells that come stock with square taper internal ISO 68mm or oversized ISO 73mm bottom brackets be retrofitted with external cups when it comes time to replace the bottom bracket? I am well aware that the cranks will have have to be replaced, too. 

I strongly recommend socks that can breathe easily and that absorb and wick away sweat. That means probably not cotton athletic socks you'd get in bulk at a warehouse store. Personal preference determines the coloration and logos, and if you're worried about style, get socks that match your kit and your shoes. Also if your alma mater has a cycling team, contact them and see if you can buy team socks. You'll be able to show school pride wherever you're riding, and they'll be quality. 

Because spokes stretch a little and settle in after you start riding, be prepared to true the wheel after the first couple rides. If you are not interested in making your own wheel, I recommend just buying a new wheel with the hub you want. It may be cheaper than getting your lbs to rebuild your wheel with your new hub.
