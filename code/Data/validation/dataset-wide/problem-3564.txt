Useful is a very relative term in relation to working out. Varying your grip between sets will change the order in which muscles are activated in order to complete the exercise. For an example, see the article on BodyBuilding.com about the various chin-up grips and their varying strengths and weaknesses. Changing the pathway you follow to achieve a full repetition will also change the activation order of the muscles, and also activate muscles that you might not normally activate much, if at all. You won't be diluting the value of doing multiple sets as long as you are still achieving a full range of motion during the exercise, as all the muscles will still be activated, just in varying order and intensity. 

Yes, the workouts should be incredibly similar. What will work to build muscle in general for one person will work for another. Remember that there are many different types of exercises and routines that work better or worse for different individuals, but those routines are shared by skinny people, muscly people, and fat people alike when sharing a common goal. You will each be using unique weights and exercises based on where you are in your physical fitness, but you can share the same exercise routines as long as they're working for you individually. 

"Feeling hungry" is a chemical and physiological response to lack of nutrients in the bloodstream. When the bloodstream is sufficiently filled with nutrients for the body's use, the brain slows the digestive process in the stomach. When the nutrients in the blood are absorbed or used (turned to fat or burned), then the brain resumes the digestive process. When the digestive tract is activated without sufficient nutrients for it to absorb, we "feel hungry" and our stomach starts growling. (Source) Drinking a glass of water will often relieve the hungry feeling that we get. Additionally, protein and fiber take longer to process than fats and carbohydrates, and will thus "stick with us" longer. So having more protein and fiber in your diet and less carbohydrates and fats will decrease the amount of time you spend feeling hungry. See this document on preventing hunger pangs and food cravings. It is my understanding that taking HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) injections will eliminate food craving and hunger pangs from a physical standpoint, although I've known people on it to experience extreme food boredom. I don't advise anyone to take hormone injections unless specifically instructed to by their physician. If you do start HCG, it is absolutely imperative that you follow every step of the diet including the retraining phase for 3 weeks after the HCG regimen is ended. I have known people that have successfully lost significant amounts of weight while taking HCG; however, the Journal of the American Medical Association and the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition both claim that it is ineffective and unsafe as a weight-loss aid. 

Regardless of the amount of calories in your diet, your "necessary" protein will fall into that range of amounts. Anything over that amount will be flushed from the body. If you eat more food, you won't need to also add more protein. The amounts listed above are sufficient. If you eat less food, you won't need to drop protein. Just stay within that range. If you're cutting pounds, but not doing any serious weight training, you're going to fall somewhere between 0.4g and 0.6g of protein per pound. If you want to take more than that, as long as you're taking in enough fiber, you won't see much in digestive problems, taking in enough calcium will prevent bone density problems, and taking in enough water will prevent kidney problems. 

In order to truly "compensate" for it, you either have to cut as many calories as are contained in the item, or you must burn that amount of calories. If "every now and then" means somewhere around or less than once a month, and the rest of the time you eat healthy and maintain a healthy and active lifestyle, I wouldn't worry about compensating for it. If instead it means once or twice a week, you need to compensate for it in some manner. One of the things you should remember is that you don't need to compensate for it all at once. If you eat an excess of 3500 calories one day, but have a 610 calorie deficit every other day of the week, your weight will be the same at the end of the week as it was in the beginning. Our weight fluctuates constantly within some margin due to this effect and the effect of hydration on the body, and small fluctuations shouldn't be perceived as a bad thing. If you do want to compensate, you can mix and match cutting or burning in any way you want to to make a full compensation. For example, you could just cut the calories. If you didn't want to cut any calories, you could just work out. If you wanted to though, you could do half the workout and cut half the calories. With the exception of hormonal imbalances, weight gain, maintenance, and loss is all about calories taken in versus calories expended. 

The most common thing I've ever been told by a doctor for treating such conditions is to alternate heat and cold. Cold reduces swelling and inflammation, heat induces blood flow. If your knee is hurting you should not be exercising. Pain is the body's way of letting us know something is wrong. If you want to do some moderate exercise, that's ok unless it makes the knee hurt. The best thing you could do is not run, but maybe do some light walking if it doesn't hurt you (at all). Like Greg said, for the purpose of exercise, use heat before and cold after. For every three minutes of heat applied, you should have one minute of cold applied. For proper healing though, rest is your best friend. If it doesn't get better soon, I would definitely talk to your doctor. 

I'm running every other day, and I run pretty hard. I'm looking for the best way to build endurance so that I can run for longer without wearing out, but I'm also liking the amount of calories that I'm burning during my runs as well. Would it be more beneficial to slow down my pace to lower my heart rate, or should I continue to run hard? According to my miCoach Pacer, almost all of my running intervals are in the "yellow" zone. 

I've been running for 11 weeks doing the Couch to 10K program, with 8-9 weeks of that being in Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS. As I've steadily increased the amount of running in my workout, I've started experiencing toward the end of my workout (last 10 minutes or so) a semi-painful almost numbing sensation from slightly behind the base of my toes to the ends of the two toes nearest my big toe on my left foot only. Bottom of Foot Diagram $URL$ Bottom of Foot Diagram from Bottom of Foot Pain The toes hurt in the area right around where the above image is marked "Toe cramps" and feel more numb and less painful toward the ends of the toes. Changing the distribution of weight on my foot as I run doesn't seem to help any with the pain once it starts. The pain goes away just a few minutes after my workout is completed and I've taken a short break. Is this a result of the minimalist running shoes, am I possibly landing wrong on my foot, or is it something that will work itself out with enough time? 

I can tell you from experience that if you've been lifting weights from a young age and have done heavy weight lifting that you could have seriously damaged your tendons and joints. If that sort of pain persists, you may need to decrease load. Taking joint and tendon supplements such as glucosamine chondroitin can help a lot. I started taking them at the advice of my pharmacist after complaining of knee pain during running (joint and tendon pain) and it helped immensely. My knees were injured due to excessive weight lifting with heavy load at too young an age. I was doing 500-600lb leg presses at ~12, and blew both knees out just falling down at ~14 years old. 

You need to do enough exercise to burn more calories than you consume in a day. For every 3500 calorie deficit, you'll lose approximately a pound. The more strenuous your exercise is, the more calories you'll burn and the longer your excess post oxygen consumption phase will last. Anywhere from 30 minutes to about an hour and a half is considered healthy, as long as you aren't overworking yourself by doing this routine more than every other day. Just remember, fat loss has very little to do with exercise, it's simple mathematics of calories in/calories out. If you eat more calories than you burn, they get stored as fat for later. If you consume 5000 calories a day and burn 3000 with lots of exercise, you'll still put on a 2 pounds every 3.5 days. If you are eating a proper healthy diet, you should be able to healthily lose 2-4 pounds each week. Considering that with exercise, one will doubtfully burn more than 3000 calories in a day, so on a 2000 calorie diet, burning 3000 calories, you'll lose 2 pounds a week. 

(For a simpler description of inversion and eversion, see WikiHow's notes on "Ankle Turns") Body-weight exercises: 

Squats are probably the most common and are a very effective leg exercise. There are a lot more options that are available to you depending on your weight set and any available equipment. For a good increase in raw leg strength, you can also do Chair Jumps. Get a (solid, stable) chair, and standing 6" away from it, jump up onto it and back down. This doesn't require any weights at all and is incredibly effective at working nearly every muscle in your legs. 

Any exercises that work your lats and biceps should be about equally as effective if you do them correctly and in sufficient quantity/sets. After about a month or so of steady training you should be able to start doing regular pull-ups without assistance, if only a few. Just keep working at it. One of my personal favorites is just getting on a chair or jumping to get up to the bar, then lowering yourself as slowly as possible back down (Negatives). This way you are using the actual weight you'll be working with later with exactly the same grip and position. Check out this article courtesy of @Barbie: StrongLifts It has some great pointers to help you build the strength and endurance to be able to do more pull-ups or chin-ups, and it also supports that within four weeks you should be able to do at least a few if you train steadily. StrongLifts' advice is to: 

Being over recommended weight is not equivalent with being obese. It is important that you maintain some body fat (the U.S. military requires 3% to the best of my knowledge) in order to be healthy. 

Eating carbohydrates (sugars and complex carbs, not fibers) will prevent you from getting light-headed, weak, or tired during exercise. Often a single piece of candy or a cookie is enough to restore and maintain energy. Play around and determine the amount that works best for you, but don't take more than you need or you'll lose the weight-loss/maintenance benefits of the exercise. 

Anything you do to increase your circulation will help with varicosis. According to varicose-help.com, exercises such as walking, bicycling, and swimming will not only help to prevent varicosis, but also deep-vein thrombosis and spider veins. Getridofthings.com also suggests exercise as the number one way to get rid of varicose and spider veins, followed immediately by maintaining a healthy body weight. Excess fat is known to reduce circulation, which in turn adds to the problem of varicosis. For worse cases that a healthy lifestyle alone won't recover, they also suggest sclerotherapy, laser surgery, or traditional surgery. Additionally, you shouldn't wear any restrictive clothing (unless recommended by a doctor) such as tight pants or socks with a tight band, as these will also reduce your circulation. In the articles I've cited, they also suggest sitting with your legs uncrossed, or elevating your legs above your heart when resting. 

This formula will figure for 70% of your maximum based on the Karvonen Method. Your Resting Heart Rate (RHR) should be averaged over a few days (3-5). You should take it upon waking, before getting out of bed, and count total beats for one minute. 

Reach across your body and let your hand go as far as it can over your shoulder. Using your opposite hand, pull your elbow toward your body as far as you can. 

A typical Granny Smith apple has 80 calories in it, with 17g of sugars, and 5g of fiber[2]. Approximately 10% of that should be burned off by the digestive process, leaving about 70 calories[1]. Eating one of these will give you a fairly satisfying "full" feeling, but doesn't contribute much to your daily caloric intake. The sugar contained in the apple is all raw fructose and glucose[3], and is combined with enough fiber to take car of the negative effects of eating the carbohydrates as far as a nutritional/dietary standpoint is concerned.
