Thus Wittgenstein grounds truth in correspondance, in relations between the picture I have of the worlds and it's states of affairs, and the world itself, as he affirms in TLP2.233 

It's possible to imagine something, for example a table, we see one everyday and can bring it in front of our minds eye (although it's a moot point whether we can see it - I certainly don't). But of course this is a real object so we have a referent. But we need not have a referent: to imagine a unicorn means we are hybridising our referents. But to imagine nothing in its proper sense (ie not the lack of something or just space) seems impossible to me, we cannot avoid our sense of ourselves. 

For rearranging this in axiomatic form (giving it the Spinozoan treatment): axiom-a: anything of value must be intrinsically rational axiom-b: nothing is intrinsically rational Now, the argument goes; 

Capital & Labour are technical terms in Marxist theory, and refer, to a first approximation, to ownership of the means of production; conventionally of course an owner of a factory is 'labouring' as much as the workers in the factory - the owner works; but the workers do not own the factory - the means of production. It is also a historically conditioned term, one doesn't think of the economy of the Roman Empire or the classical Islamic Empire as capitalist; it is also conditioned by what is produced - the commodity; and one expects that a large part of the growth of the economy is produced by commodification of new or larger areas of the natural economy. For example, the commodification of mortgage and other consumer debt, aka securitisation in the last business cycle. 

We could say, they are in time; but whilst in time, they do not change; they have constancy; this I think, is the usual explanation. But consider, would we get the same theory, if we supposed these atoms were not subject to time? For if they aren't subject to time; then they can't come into being, and nor can they pass away, and nor can they increase or decrease. 

Is naive set theory, simply set theory that has been left unformalised as the entry in Wikipedia suggests? However, the SEP, in its entry on inconsistent mathematics, suggests that: 

The measurement problem is a problem in Quantum Mechanics. Although its decribed as a philosophical problem in Physics - it is in fact a problem of physics. This is how Bohr, Einstein & Heisenberg when discussing this would have seen it. It is dscribed as such now as the mathematics of QM is very well understood now - so it has become a seperate question on the interpretation of QM. Its worth bearing in mind, though, an older question in the philosophy of physics, to see the physical relevance of so-called philosophical questions. One of the criticisms faced by Newtons very successful theory of Universal Gravitation, universal because it tied together the separate domain of terrestial & celestial motion (in Aristotles theory of Physics) under the rubric of one force, is the question of force acting at a distance. How does force that originate at the Sum affect the motion of the planet Earth here? It took three centuries before that particular question was solved when Einstein realised it was the very fabric of space-time that transmitted the force. One might say a problem of physics becomes philosophical when it is a question too diffcult to answer with the mathematical & physical technology then at hand. Now, Quantum Mechanics describes a physical system by a probability wave which evolves in two distinct ways. It evolves in a deterministic manner until a physical property of the system is measured and then it evolves in a non-determinstic manner and collapses into a value that is measured by the observer. Everyone agrees on what QM says, the problem comes with interpreting the situation described so precisely by the mathematics/physics of QM. Bohr, in what is known as the Copenhagen interpretation, stated that the measurement of the physical system was dependent in a crucial way on the experimental situation including that of the observer. One could say that it is observer dependent. From a philosophical point of view this has a certain family resemblence with Kantian Metaphysics. Heisenberg took a different slant on the same problem - he said that the physical system had no physical properties as such until it was measured. That is his metaphysics was positivist or Instrumentalist. Einstein himself took a realist position on the measurement problem - he insisted that the physical system had physical properties at all times. This is in fact the classical point of view, as one would be familiar with from Newtonian Mechanics. So here we have three philosophical interpretations - Neo-Kantian, Positivist & Realist. The realist position being traditional in Classical physics. Positivist since the development of 'positive' science in Vienna at the turn of the 20C, when one could say the very basis of science turns itself into a philosophy - nothing is unless it can be measured by some instrument. Neo-Kantian takes off from the Kantian position where the observer conditions how experience is to be made intelligible. Notably several questions are left unclarified by the usual treatments - why the separation between a macroscopic realm where observations are done by observers that are classical, and the observed Quantum Mechanical realm. Secondly must observers be concious? Third - why is there a deterministic phase followed by a non-determinstic collapse? There are certain results of QM (Bells Inequalities, Kockhen-Specker Theorem) that show that a realist local theory is not possible. That is any realist interpretation of QM must have non-local (faster than light propagation) correlations (as in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Gedanken Experiment). In fact such a theory has been constructed by Bohm - de Broglies pilot wave theory - otherwise known as Bohmian Mechanics. Of course it was only with the advent of Einsteins theory of relativity that the speed of light was understood as a fundamental limit, a violation of it would indicate a violation of causality. Two modern solutions of the interpretational problem of QM is Relational Quantum Mechanics as put forward by Rovelli, and Consistent Histories by Isham and others. In Relational QM, one democratises the idea of an observer. First, if I observe a system then that system is observing me. Secondly, an observer may as well be an electron as well as some human being. Conciousness is not the marker of an observer rather it is the ability to be affected by what is observed. So in a manner of speaking, a planet observes the gravitational field of the sun. An electron observes the electro-magnetic field, and conversely the electromagnetic field observes the electron. Here, 'observe' is a synonym for to affect or be affected by. In this view, there are no special interactions that we choose to call measurements - all interactions are measurements. Consistent Histories is used with Quantum Decoherence to establish which sequence of propositions can be meaningfully asked of a system. The decoherence of the quantum mechanical system in its environment is used to statistically 'magick' away the wave-packet collapse. One argument against decoherence is that one should include decoherence with the physical system under observation, but given the fluctuations one expects at the planck-scale shows that conceptually that this is not practicable. There is of course Everetts 'multiverse' of parallel universes, which offers the benefit of a realist interpretation at the enormous expense of an enormous multiplication of universes, but I find this enormous 'bristley' multiplication of universes somehow unflattering to QM, and requires a shave by Occams Razor... 

Fallacies are a good idea, but they should be also be subject to critical inquiry otherwise they may become sacred cows in the minds of the student. Exercises with full solutions are great for motivated students. Even better if there are hints. Venn diagrams are good because they are visual. You don't want your textbook to be a wall of text, or do you? Bios are nice to give some backfrop to the discussion. But I think it might be even nicer to have a discussion of the tradition of logic and its many modalities to give a greater depth and coherence to the subject. 

This on the face of it is astonishing. Can, I by thinking, make a chair into a kettle? Or turn a man into a moon? But this isn't what Kant is saying. He is supposing that our understanding of space & time is already inherent in our own minds - it is that part of our cognition that he calls the intuition (and not to be confused what we ordinarily call intuition), and we impose them onto the world. One can see from this that he rescues causality - and thus rescues empiricism. He also shows that though we sense only fleeting sensations, and at bottom we are only a bundle of sensations, that bundle, the self also has a reality. He calls this the unity of consciousness. Finally, he founds morality - at least theoretically on a rational principle. 

We need to consider what this means in practise and not just as words: Extension is a specific property of matter: I can pick up a piece of bamboo that has a certain length (or extension); and then I can break it into two pieces, one piece which I let drop to the ground and the other i take with me. And what I can do with bamboo, I can do with rocks, with houses, planets and galaxies. Or I can do it to the body of a dead man - a cadaver or corpse; or to a Barbary duck hunted in the long grass on some autumnal day creased with clouds. Or to a molecule, and then the atom, and then a proton and then till we reach a true simple atom, and in itself nothing composite being pure and simple extension. But then time - is time extension? In one way, yes: each day is divided from from another by the night, and every hour into minutes; and in another way, no: for I cannot break a day in half, except by metaphor - I cannot even hold it; what I see by outer sense is motion, is change - energia - and time is measured by motion, and by motion that moves in regular cycles - the pendulum. And also space; for space surely has extension but unlike a piece of bamboo cannot be broken; though one can and does mark off one part of space from another - and thus the invention of territory and territorialisation - except of course this is not space itself; but what is in space: ground, earth and air; like time it seems too, we cannot grasp it; but that it is but a stage, in the sense of ground. And in this sense, too - time; but notably Descarte took time to be an inner sense (and then Kant took space too to be an inner sense). Now we note, that marking is prior to breaking; for to break a piece of bamboo I must break it at a specific place, though I may care not at which place I break it. And this is true for atoms - in their true sense; for an atom as a pure extensionless point is arguably nothing; and merely marks a position and a point in space; whereas as a string - it has parts; so that it can curve, twist or close up into a loop; but merely to have extension in one direction and not another is to replay this first error; and therefore and thus branes. 

The cogito when understood to be in descent from Avicenna is not novel; for Avicenna too, was arguing for what constitutes certain knowledge; but is novel in how it is later theorised (see above). 

In the propositional theory of language, developed through Frege to Wittgenstein; is it correct to say that a certain fixed meaning is given to a proposition; and that through the Correspondance Theory of Truth? Granted the truth of Kants observation in (iii) how can such a theory take that into account - or has it been already? 

All of these are very general topics, on things of a physical nature; they're really about turning over and probing the physical ideas of his time; and because of this, is of lasting value - though people just tend to see the word 'Aristotelian', some image of Aristotle, bequeathed to them by tradition; but not the actual words of A. 

This is in fact a mirror image of the theists argument - why should prove the existence of something that I and many others also clearly and distinctly perceive. In this sense, atheism is a religion; but also it is not as there is not any core rituals, or doctrine as such for it to cohere with; one could suppose, given sufficient time and development that this will or could become a distinct possibility; that until now there has been no significant atheism 'church' - if one discounts, as one should, Comtes Religion of Humanity, and the Brights. But then again, there has never been a significant fraction of humanity without some form of theistic belief; that there is now, prominently in Western Europe; might suggest that in the future that a coherence into a religious type movement with a positive doctrine might be a distinct possibility. Finally, one really ought to examine what one means by 'clear and distinct perception'; by what 'light'; and how is this not a 'revealing' and therefore, in a minor way, part of a ladder of 'revelation'. 

It's a book written in haste after Machiavelli had been dismissed from the Florentine government and whilst he was trying to reinstate himself. It's generally seen as describing early statecraft - in which the Prince maintains his estate - as realpolitik, ie a kind of political realism; power based on coercion the only right; (whereas for Hobbes this was only one of the powers of a Sovereign). The word he uses to present though the ethic of the Prince, as characteristic of him is virtu which would normally be translated as moral goodness - but he's obviously using it here in a different way; in one sense he's describing the nature of virtue for a Prince, which would be very different from a commoner. Still it presents a one-sided view, which he later corrected in a book written in leisure, his Discourses on Livy, and which according to the SEP 

It isn't the predicate nature of these qualifiers or adjectives that are important here; we are not working in a logical context but in an affective one; or one can say phenomenalogical one; we are concerned here with the qualia of viscosity or of heaviness; as it appears or felt in the consciousness. 

This is a loaded question which is directing people towards an expected answer, by weighting motivations that are cynical. 

It's the third example that most closely matches the principle as you put it; though I can't say exactly how Lewis uses the actuality of these possible worlds to solve or make intelligible the philosophical problems he sets himself. 

He isn't terribly useful on early Greek philosophy, for example the Pre-Socratics or the Sophists. The IEP is much better.
