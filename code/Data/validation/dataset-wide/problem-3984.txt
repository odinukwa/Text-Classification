The existence of such an adjunction implies that $B \otimes -$ preserves limits, which doesn't seem very likely. Here is a counterexample, though probably not the simplest one. Set $B = k[y]$ and consider the inverse limit of $k[x]/(x^{n+1})$. If we take the tensor products first, then we get $k[y][[x]]$ while if we take the limit first we obtain $k[[x]][y]$. These are distinct, since the first contains for example $(1-yx)^{-1} = \sum_{k \geq 0} y^k x^k$ and the second does not. 

Newton polytopes and the polynomials they support We will use the standard notion $\mathbf{x}^{\mathbf{a}} := \prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{a_i}$ to represent monomials in a multivariate (Laurent) polynomial ring. The Newton polytope of a polynomial is the convex hull of its exponent vectors. We say that a polytope $P$ supports a polynomial $p$ if $P$ is the Newton polytope of $p$. Example 1: The polytope $\mathrm{conv} \{[0,0]^\top\}$ supports all constant polynomials over any bivariate polynomial ring. More generally, a lattice point $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ supports every polynomial of the form $c_\mathbf{a}\mathbf{x}^\mathbf{a}$ where $c_\mathbf{a}$ is an element of an arbitrary ring. Example 2: The Newton polytopes of the polynomials \begin{align} p &= 2 + 3x^2 - 2y + \frac{1}{2}xy \in \mathbb{Q}[x,y,z] \text{ and }\\ q &= -1 + 8x - x^2 + 5y + xy \in \mathbb{Z}_9[x,y,z] \end{align} both have vertices $V = \{[0,0,0]^\top, [2,0,0]^\top, [0,1,0]^\top, [1,1,0]^\top\}$ and hence coincide. In general we have the following: Fix a (convex) lattice polytope $P \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Then $P$ is the Newton polytope of a polynomial $p$ if and only if $p$ is of the form $\sum_{\mathbf{a} \in P \cap \mathbb{Z}^d} c_\mathbf{a}\mathbf{x}^\mathbf{a}$ such that $c_\mathbf{a} \neq 0$ whenever $\mathbf{a}$ is a vertex of $P$. A note on standard simplices There are two geometric objects typically associated with the term standard $(d-1)$-dimensional simplex: one is the full-dimensional polytope in $\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$ whose vertices consist of the origin together with the $d-1$ standard unit vectors; the other is a codimension one polytope in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose vertices are the $d$ standard unit vectors. Since there is a natural map between these two polytopes that preserves typically relevant polyhedral data, the choice of which definition to use is usually motivated by the problem at hand. In the OP the probability vectors are naturally associated to points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose coordinates sum to $1$, so taking the second view of the standard simplex (as suggested in the OP) seems more natural. The dimension of the product of simplices First we collect some basic facts. The dimension of a polytope is the dimension of its affine span. In particular, the dimension of (the convex hull of) a point is zero. The dimension of a product of polytopes is just the sum of dimensions of the factors. Now, in the computation of the dimension of $\Delta^{(i)}$ in the OP the dimension of $\{0\}$ is $0$ and not $1$. So the dimension of $\Delta^{(i)}$ is $\delta -d_i + 1$, as expected. 

There is a stronger result: Every r.e. set is primitive r.e. in your sense. Short proof: Kleene's Normal Form Theorem. Longer proof: Let S be an r.e. set, assumed WLOG nonempty; fix a ∈ S, and fix an algorithm e where S is precisely the range of the function computed by e. Consider the following algorithm: Given the input pair (n, M), run e on input n for M steps. If it gives an output by then, output whatever e outputs; otherwise output a. The functions which set up the initial state of computation, advance a state by one step, and extract the output from a final state, are all p.r. Thus the above algorithm defines a p.r. function, and it is easy to check that its range is S. Edit: Cutland's Computability is a decent resource for these questions. 

I don't think this is actually an injection on isomorphism classes. We can see this by restricting to extremely nice spaces, say finite simply-connected CW complexes with free homology. In this situation cohomology and homology are dual and we have a Whitehead theorem for cohomology--it makes things easy to think about, though I'm sure you can concoct counterexamples with weaker hypotheses. First consider two such spaces whose cohomology is the same but whose ring structure is different, for example $\mathbb{C}P^n$ and a wedge of even spheres. The singular complexes are certainly isomorphic, but this could not be induced by a map of spaces. So your functor does not induce an injection on isomorphism classes. Similarly, one sees that the functor is not full, there are maps that fail to respect the ring structure and so could not be induced by any map of spaces, one example is the map that identifies the homologies of the two spaces above. To see that the functor is not faithful, consider the Hopf map, $S^3 \to S^2$, which surely induces the zero map in homology. 

This question may be better answered by going to the intuition. Let X be a set with some sort of "local structure"; a metric space will do, but any reasonable sort of "closeness" is fine. We want to say a set U ⊆ X is open if, whenever U contains a point p, it also contains all those points q ∈ X which are "near p". Given this, U = X is clearly open. If p ∈ U, we want all the points of X "near p" to be in U; but every point of X is in U, so this is trivially true. ∅ is also clearly open. For this to be false, ∅ would have to contain a point p but not all the points near p; but as ∅ contains no points, this is impossible. Also consider the following: Let f : X → {0,1} be the constant function sending every p ∈ X to 0. We want constant functions to be continuous, no matter how fine the topology on {0,1}. So f -1[{0}] = X and f -1[{1}] = ∅ both must be open (and both must be closed). 

Deligne's article, 'Categories Tannakiennes,' section 5 would be a good place to look. It was published in the Grothendieck Festschrift, vol. 2. 

Let $\zeta_k$ be a countable dense sequence of points in the boundary and consider $f(z) = \sum \frac{1}{2^k} \frac{1}{z-\zeta_k}$. The sum is plainly uniformly convergent on any subset of finite distance from the boundary, in particular on any compact subset of the interior. 

No. Consider the case where your sets happen to be abelian groups with an action of G. Pushing out the zero morphism over any map gives the cokernel, so a special case of your question is whether taking G-invariants is right exact, and it isn't. This should give an idea of where counterexamples might come from. Concretely, lets say your group is $\mathbb{Z}/2$ and you push out $\mathbb{Z}/2 \to \ast$ over itself. The ordinary pushout is a point (with the trivial action). But if you take invariants first you find you are pushing two points out over the empty set, which results in two points. 

Let $z$ be a word, and let $M=FM(a,b)/z^{-1}$. If we wish $a$ and $b$ to be invertible in $M$, then $z$ must contain both $a$ and $b$ at least once. (For example, $FM_2[a^{-n}]=FM_2[a^{-1}]\cong F(a)\ast FM(b)$ by the canonical maps.) Suppose $z = a^nwa^m$ with $n, m>0$. If $z^{-1}$ exists, then $a$ has a right inverse $r = a^{n-1}wa^mz^{-1}$ and a left inverse $l = z^{-1}a^nwa^{m-1}$, and in fact these two are equal by the standard argument ($l = lar = r$); so just say $l=r=a^{-1}$. Then $z^{-1}a^nwa^m = e$ implies $z^{-1}a^nw = a^{-m}$ implies $a^mz^{-1}a^nw = e$ ($w$ has a left inverse), and similarly $w$ has a right inverse which is the same. If $z$ contains any occurrences of $b$, then we choose $w$ to begin and end with $b$; by the earlier argument applied to $w$, $b$ is invertible. Symmetrically, if $z$ begins and ends with $b$ but contains an occurrence of $a$, then $z^{-1}$ exists implies $a^{-1}$, $b^{-1}$ exists. I suspect these are the only cases which work (i.e., inverting a word of the form $awb$ or $bwa$ would not invert $a$ or $b$) but cannot yet prove it. (EDIT: This is false, see Mark's comment below.) EDIT: Partial result! Consider the structure $M$ whose underlying set is $\{(m,e) \in \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{Z} : m\ge e\}$ with binary operation $(m,e)\ast(m',e') = (\max(m,e+m'), e+e')$. It is routine to check that this is a monoid. Let $z=awb$ contain $i$ copies of $a$ and $j$ copies of $b$, and consider the morphism $f\colon FM(a,b)\to M$ with $f(a) = (0,-j)$ and $f(b) = (i,i)$. From counting it is clear that $f(z) = (m,0)$ for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$. If $m=0$ (as it will be for any word of the form $a^ib^j$, and many other words besides), then $f$ extends to a morphism $FM(a,b)[z^{-1}]\to M$. But $f(a)$ has no left inverse; if $(m,e)\ast (0,-j) = (0,0)$, then $e=j$ and $\max(m,j)=0$, which is impossible ($j>0$ by assumption). Thus $a^{-1}$ cannot be a member of $FM(a,b)[z^{-1}]$, i.e., inverting $z$ does not invert $a$. (Intuition: For each word in $FM(a,b)$, start at zero and read the word from left to right. For each $a$, descend $j$ steps; for each $b$, ascend $i$ steps; and track both your peak and your current position. If reading $z$ never gets you to the positive numbers, then adjoining $z^{-1}$ does not get you $a^{-1}$ (or similarly $b^{-1}$).) 

In his unpublished article, Combinatorial properties of triangulations of oriented matroids, Julian Webster proves that every triangulation of an oriented matroid is partitionable. Does this result appear somewhere in the published literature? If so, where? Edits: 

Metric dimension is well-defined The usual definition of metric dimension (and the one initially given in the OP) is the smallest cardinality of any metric basis. This generalizes the notion for metric dimension in graphs and is well-defined for any metric space (finite or not). To see this let $(M,d)$ be a metric space and $\mathcal{G}$ be the collection of metric generating sets. There are two natural posets one can define on $\mathcal{G}$: let $P_1 = (\mathcal{G}, |\cdot|)$ be defined by $G \prec G'$ if $|G| < |G'|$ and let $P_2 = (\mathcal{G}, \subset)$ be defined by $G \prec G'$ if $G \subset G'$. Note that the minimal elements of $P_1$ are the metric bases $\mathcal{B}(M,d)$. Also notice that the metric bases are contained in the minimal elements of $P_2$ and that this containment is generally strict. Metric Bases and Matroids Fix a metric space $(M,d)$ where $M$ is a finite set. Let $r$ be the metric dimension of $(M,d)$. Since the metric bases $\mathcal{B}(M,d)$ of $(M,d)$ all have the same cardinality one can ask if and when $\mathcal{B}$ is the set of bases of a matroid. Recall that a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of (finite) sets is the set of bases of a matroid if it satisfies the following exchange axiom: for every $B,B' \in \mathcal{B}$ and every $e \in B$ there is some $f \in B'$ such that the set $B \setminus \{e\} \cup \{f\}$ is also in $B$. First let's see that there are some finite metric spaces whose metric bases are the bases of a matroid. Let $G = (V,E)$ be an undirected connected graph and let $d: V \times V \to \mathbb{N}$ be the map that takes a pair of vertices to the length of the shortest path between them. Then $M(G) := (V,d)$ is a metric space. A simple computation shows the following fact. Fact: Let $G = (V,E)$ be a simple connected graph with $|V| \le 4$. Then the metric bases of $M(G)$ are the bases of a matroid. This fact does not extend to all graphs with $|V|=5$. To see this consider the graph $G = ([5], \{13,14,15,24,25,35\})$. Then $M(G)$ has 22 metric generating sets and six metric bases $$\mathcal{B}(M(G)) = \{12, 15, 23, 24, 25, 34\}.$$ Notice that for $B = 12$, $e = 2$, and $B'= 34$ there is no element $f \in B'$ such that $B \setminus 2 \cup f$ is also a metric basis. So the metric bases of $M(G)$ are not the bases of any matroid. This graph is unique among simple connected graphs on five vertices in that it is the only one whose metric bases are not matroidal. Let $f(n)$ be the number of the simple connected graphs on $n$ vertices and let $g(n)$ be the number of such graphs whose metric bases are not matroidal. We used these Macaulay2 scripts to compute $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ for $n \le 7$. 

Very famous one is the Feit-Thompson theorem: if n is odd, then G is solvable. Though I suppose this is stated (but not proved) in most modern algebra texts. 

There's a subtle point at the bottom of the first page and top of the second, to wit: "For every sentence σ, $M\vDash\sigma$ iff $N\vDash(m\vDash\sigma)$. In particular, $N\vDash$ (m is a model)." If "model" means "model of ZF", then one cannot conclude this. It is possible that N knows, for each particular σ ∈ ZF, that $m\vDash\sigma$, without knowing that m models ZF as a whole. This is because N 's grasp of what exactly is in ZF can be incorrect; if there are nonstandard integers, then there are also nonstandard (codes for) sentences, some of which will be in the "local copy" of ZF. However, if "model" means "model of Σ" where Σ is an explicit finite list of axioms, all of which are in ZF (and with other nice properties as in the paper), then one can make the necessary leap. To model Σ is to model each σ in the explicit list; thus, if M does this, then N must know that m does this. 

More on when the metric bases of a graph are matroidal can be found in these two papers: BC2011 and B2013. Another example Finally let's return to Example 1 of this answer to the previous question. In that example we have $M = \{0,1,2,3\}$ and $d$ given by $$d(x,y) = \begin{cases} 2 \text{ if } x,y \neq 0 \\ 2 + \frac{1}{y} \text{ if } x = 0. \end{cases}$$ The metric generating sets of $(M,d)$ consist of all subsets of $\{0,1,2,3\}$ other than the singletons $\{i\}$, where $i \in \{1,2,3\}$. In particular, $\{0\}$ is a metric generating set of cardinality one. So the metric dimension of $(M,d)$ is one and $\{0\}$ is the only metric basis. It follows that the set of metric bases $\mathcal{B}(M,d)$ is matroidal with the corresponding matroid on four elements being isomorphic to the uniform matroid $U_{1,1}$ together with three loops. 

No, the proof is correct, and it's taking $\mathrm{coker}\ T = H_2/\mathrm{im}\ T$. The essence of the argument is that $V\oplus\mathbb{C}^n$ contains $V$ as a closed subspace, regardless of the norm on $V$, and that $H_2$ is "close enough" to $(\mathrm{im}\ T)\oplus\mathbb{C}^n$. The full argument goes like this: Let $T: H_1\to H_2$ be Fredholm (the $H_i$ are Hilbert spaces). WLOG $T$ is injective, otherwise replace $H_1$ with $(\mathrm{ker}\ T)^\perp$. Choose $v_1,\dots, v_n\in H_2$ which represent a basis of $\mathrm{coker}\ T$, and use them to define a linear function $\mathbb{C}^n\to H_2$. Combine this with $T$ to get a linear map $\overline{T}: H_1\oplus\mathbb{C}^n\to H_2$. Now $\overline{T}$ is a linear isomorphism, so its inverse $\widetilde{T}$ is also a linear isomorphism. $\overline{T}$ is also continuous, so the graph of $\overline T$ is a closed subset of $H_1\oplus\mathbb{C}^n\oplus H_2$, so the graph of $\widetilde T$ is a closed subset of $H_2\oplus H_1\oplus\mathbb{C}^n$, which makes $\widetilde T$ continuous by the Closed Graph Theorem. (This last is not an obvious statement; it's a consequence of the Baire Category Theorem). Finally, $\mathrm{im}\ T$ is precisely the pullback of $H_1$ through $\widetilde T$, making it closed. As to why most sources don't present it this way… I think in most cases where somebody wants to prove that a given operator $T$ is Fredholm, it's just easier to establish that $\mathrm{coker}\ T$ is finite-dimensional after proving that $\mathrm{im}\ T$ is closed.
