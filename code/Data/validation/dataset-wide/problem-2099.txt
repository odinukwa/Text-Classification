I work as IT Security professional. This is very shady behavior by your employer. At all the companies I worked at, all require that individual accounts be used to preserve non - repudiation, such that the user cannot later deny that he / she is non accountable for an action due to his / her login having being used. If your company is of a decent size and well run, there should be a detailed IT incident response plan that should outline what the user is to do when a breach is suspected, as in this instance. Follow what is outlined in that document, which most likely involves reporting to IT Security, if that functions exists at your company. Your IT security team may not even be aware of this potentially malicious activity occurring. Even if this your employer legitimately monitoring your activity, which I doubt, there should be procedures outlining which employees are authorized by company management to monitor employee network activity. So if even if done by an internal employee, if he or she is not authorized to monitor traffic, the IT Security function should know, as its unauthorized activity. 

For example, if the auditor discovers deficiency in system access, if such access required another prerequisite condition to be true, tell the auditor such. 

Do not be accusatory and try to avoid the use of the word you as well as words such as failed. These make objective findings (assuming valid ones backed by testing work papers) sound personal. People often react strongly and defensively to what they perceive to be personal failures. It has been my experience that deficiencies are often not the result of what one person did or failed to do, but of faulty process design, lack of resources, technological limitations, or ignorance. 

No, such a response oversteps professional boundaries and would be inappropriate. The company wants to know why you want the job for you, and not so you can use the job to help you fulfill your personal desires 

You just need to communicate with him and let him know it's a distraction. It may take telling him more than once. I had a co-worker that would wear headphones and hum or sing. I just had to say "You're doing it again" (I said it in a friendly tone and we both laughed about it). She would apologize and stop. For a while. We're all human. 

Resumes and background checks are not the same thing. Your resume is a marketing tool, and as such, you choose what best represents the skills you are selling. Information provided for a background check is expected to be more thorough and is not about your skills. I have never known of anyone losing a job because they left something off a resume. I have known of people losing a job due to failure to disclose information for a background check. It was not for a failing to list a job, it was failure to list a minor ticket. But the issue was never about the thing that was left off, the issue was about the fact that the candidate was not honest. 

You might consider declining the job (and the test). I would not want to have a positive drug test in my history. I know that confidentiality rules should prevent any one from learning the results (other than those in the specific chain that are expected to learn the results). But information has a way of spreading. Could someone at this company talk to someone at another company and jeopardize your chances there (not legal, but if they aren't caught, how would you know)? If I thought there was a possibility that I would legitimately fail a test, I would not take it. There will of course be consequences for this job, but it would end there. You don't have to disclose your reason for withdrawing from consideration, so rumors of drug use would not follow you beyond this point. 

Require that you leave and submit your resume and application online. Ask you to submit an application through an in-store kiosk. Ask you to take a test at an in-store kiosk. Based on your score, the store manager may talk to you. 

The reason for what I did is partly due to ensuring technical accuracy, but also partially due to past experience with management, management style, and workplace culture. Getting an accurate read on management style, company culture, and a likely management response (given security is not always popular) is challenging and can often only be done through several years of experience. I do not want to brush off his questions as I had these same questions in the past when I was a junior. I also do not want to appear rude / arrogant by suggesting I know better. 

If your work in a regulated field such as health care, certain regulations apply such as HIPPA. Penalties for incidents can be severe. Even if your industry is not regulated, consequences can still be severe in the form of lost current business as well as prospective future business if the password incident exposes customer data. To summarize my point: 

You should reply honestly with who told you to implement such changes. However depending upon your standing in the company, you may also want to suggest changes to the owner / your manager as to best practices. Ultimately, this experience is a good lesson to improve upon the deficient processes that led to this situation in the first place. I assume your manager / company owner is rational and reasonable such that they realize that streamlining processes is in their best interests. 

Given I work in IT, in a profession that tries to deter fraud, let me give you what I think happened in your case. It appears that your email address was spoofed, for the purpose of sending malicious emails. Email spoofing is actually not hard to do given you have the technical knowledge of how emails are sent and interpreted at the receiving email server. Using the old method of validation, SPF,(Sender permitted form), your email server as the receiver compares the IP address of its domain host (ex: @XXX)with the origination IP of the email. Only if these match would the email be allowed through, and blocked else wise as spam / malicious email. This old method is flawed though as it relies heavily on user administration and is not standardarized in how failures are handled. Sometimes, one may not want to block legitimate email, which eases network administration but phishing / spam / become a problem. A more modern method that is being used in conjunction with SPF is DMARC. DMARC policy is embedded within the DNS information in the email server and tells the email how a message failing SPF validation (Sending origination IP <> receiving domain host IP) via its -p flag. This would definitely help you avoid a similar situation in the future, but I doubt a small employer would have the resources to properly implement this technique. How you should proceed Your SysAdmin is suspect in this case. Its highly unusual for him to need to update your machine locally, as updates can almost always be pushed centrally from a server to each initial client authenticated against it. There should be logs, if they have not been tampered with showing an user trail of actions taken. If there a another person with admin privileges who you trust and you reasonably believe is not involved, explain what you saw, and only stick to facts, such as the IT admin frequently logging on your machine for "updates". Work with this person to gather some evidence such as logs from your email server. Depending on what you find, present to higher management or HR your facts. 

If I were you, I would sit down and talk with him. It sounds like the expectations around your working relationship weren't defined. He appears to be under the impression that you work for him and are to "follow his orders" and your impression is that you're working together. You could also talk with your COO and ask him what his expectations were of you two working together. That might be good information to have in your back pocket with when you do talk with the PM. More often than not these types of misunderstandings are due to a lack of clear expectations and communication. Sometimes it is someone being an asshole but more often than not it's just as simple as a misunderstanding. 

You could joke back with, "you must not have enough work to do if you're keeping tabs on me" or something like that. You can try that approach and see if he backs off. I would feel okay responding that way in front of others. If his comments are that blatant then other people won't think less of you for responding in a lighthearted way. This person is clearly being a bully. It's possible that your manager won't let him work from home because he's not productive and is jealous of the trust that your manager has in you. Regardless - I would mention this to your manager. If you don't have regularly scheduled one on ones meetings with him then I'd set one up. If you don't get any traction with your manager then I would talk with HR. If you do reach out to HR then definitely let your manager know so he's not surprised when he hears from them. There's absolutely no reason for anyone to work in a hostile work environment. This includes you as well. 

You could talk with your boss and ask what him what the expectations are going to be around future business trips as far as after work activities. You could also let him know that you thought the karaoke bar was a bit unexpected and guage his reaction. For some businesses, it's common practice to take visiting guests out for some kind of entertainment. A friend of mine would be taken to strip clubs and the like because it was the 'cat's away' mentality. "You're away from your boring wife and now you can look at naked young women without her knowing." In the best case your boss says you can skip those activities, in the worst case you only have to travel there infrequently. But as a woman, I appreciate your question regarding this. 

I have an accountancy background and currently works in InfoSec as an IT auditor. Auditing and accountancy are not considered "exciting" or "creative" jobs, but rather a profession that provides a service to the public. Although the job can be monotonous, job stability, good earnings potential, and satisfaction when the public benefits from your work can be considered rewards in and of its own. Some typical duties of CPAs and chartered accountants such as attestation and assurance, protects the public who relies on such services, from potential harm such as fraud. Often the most prized assets of an accountant are their sense of duty to the public, ethics, and integrity. For those who don't do their job well (think Arthur Andersen and Enron), its not only them accountants themselves who are hurt but the public as well. In short, if you are looking for a "popular" or "creative" job then you are working in the wrong field. Being apathetic about your job hurts not often only yourself, but others who rely on your work as well. If you are not intrinsically motivated, then not much can be done. 

I won't mince words with you: You tell her that her resume is poor and will most likely be rejected. Be firm and advise her what she needs to do to fix her resume such as choosing a more professional font, and ensuring her work experience fully captures her value as a prospective employee of your company. You do her no favors by being soft with her. It is to her best interest that she be a little hurt now than to be near unemployable with her current resume. Sometimes been friends with someone, means revealing plainly, and unemotionally, an unpleasant truth. 

If you ever were to interact with an auditor, the fact you were one previously should enable you to somewhat foresee what an auditor would be looking for and reduce any unease you / your company may have. In this case , I would not be surprised if your management chooses you as lead point of contact with the external auditors due to your domain knowledge. Finally, there is often a stereotype that communication (especially to management) is an weak point for developers. As a former auditor, I would expect you to have superior communications skills as it was your job to make sure management understood the risks as they stem from IT, facing the company
