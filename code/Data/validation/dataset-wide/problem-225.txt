Cybernetic brain implants of language libraries, or voice-recognition software architecture. The programmer would need to scan a lot of libraries and research efficiently. The libraries would be instantly assessable, so the cause, effect, methods, of all libraries could be efficiently assessed very fast. All programming languages would have a common interface, and could be nested together effortlessly, and their cause and effect could be conceptually described in human terms and arranged into mechanisms with a human-spoken, computer written, cooperation. 

Recreational sound is essential for any animal with a large auditory intelligence and an imagination and the ability to control sound production. 1/ would aliens sing? animals and humans sing, depending on their species, lizards don't for example, and the first step towards alien music would be aliens singing. if they are social animals it is likely that they would sing together, and we would find alien song fascinating. 2/ What would humans think of recreational sound from aliens playing with acoustic or digital equipment?!? It is conjecture wether you would find a particular alien's different musics agreeable or not, but there would be parallel and diverged evolutions of recreational sound styles everywhere in the universe. Aliens would certainly have invented piano type polyphonic tonal machines, acoustic instruments, drums, strings, metal instruments, and there would be technology aliens with digital sound studios adapted form telecoms equipment. The Alien could prefer ultrasounds like echolocation, different frequency spreads, atonal, microtonal, animal call music, techno, neo-classical, melodic. It depends on the Alien, on the whole, some of his music could be awesome, some could be interesting, and some could be boring. 

the compression of the atmosphere would be similar to many millions of atomic bombs going off, so actually the entire planet would be enveloped in something similar to an atomic shockwave, where the cars move 100ds of meters sideways in the wind, without even thinking about the ground movement happening at the same time. The ground movement would occur prior to the wind effects, moving very fast and very far compared to an ordinary earthquake. The air itself would become alot less clear because of all the thermal and compression effects happening within it, water would vaporise be compressed while the wind would be going at 1000kph, so you wouldnt see very much. There is a documentary on nova with scientists discussing the effect of a neutron star invading the solar system, it's totally false because the iron of the earth would compress against the crust like a huge hypervolcano, and pop out of the breach in the crust and fly into space, long before stones would start to fly around. It depends on the velocity of impact, typically at meteoric velocities. The effect would be similar to an large earthquake of which the main shockwave would be transported directly through the mantle rather than around the crust. The effect would be different depending on the angle from the percussion. The power of the shockwaves would be enough to create waves of force lifting the crust in heights in between 10 meters and 1000 kilometer, depending on what rebound of the wave you first catch, cars would literally be flung very far into the air a few seconds after the initial schockwave occured, and the intensity of the earthquake would increase until the entire surface of the earth was wabbling and cracking by in waves at least 100 kilometers tall. The precise model of the surface and the earth's crust's interaction with the viscous and compressed inner materials of the earth would be a function of the earth crust's thickness and the size of the shock waves traversing the mantle, disassembling the crust in the first moments while the observer was alive. 

I am trying to write a world economy system for a utopia. Can a worldwide stock exchange with only 6 price changes every day work? i.e. people can only sell or buy n-stocks every 6 hours, compared to price changes every 10ms as happens in our world? You could queue a transaction to happen at the next exchange, and on the tock of the hour all the trades would go through. The number 6 is so that it's on equal playing fields for people around the planet with different day and night times. Because a market works better if apples, oranges and iron and everything changes less than 10,000 times per day, in a humanly recognizable time. 

Intellect is qualitative and not quantitative. People with a high IQ can be autistic spectrum, and can read 100ds of books about social science and psychology, and yet be much less performant socially than people with normal IQ, i.e. aloof/rash. Instead of IQ people can be rated by hours worked that decade, charitable contribution, driving offences. in politics the most important thing is to stop career politics and mix politicians with ordinary workers, and to stop secrecy in all fields, secrecy in commerce, war, money, banks, lawmaking, secrets are the big challenge of governments, especially secret lobbying, influence, and secret influenced lawmaking. Also, politicians should be tested with current affairs questions like oral exam students on TV on a veranda for selection, for their knowledge, and not made to argue publicly for assesment as the only exam, and not hyped up by superparties that select the richest with pacts and syndicates. 

When the dinosaurs died, many forests could have perished for 15 - 20 years in a row, so there would have been many tons of forests which had lots of mushrooms, millions of flies and beetles feeding of the giant dead animals for 10 years, lots of squirrels and other animals feeding from funghi and beetles. If you had a forest that had a dark period every 2-3 years when one of the moons eclipses the sun or a super volcano erupted regularly, there could be forests that have major diebacks every few years and that become mushroom worlds for 1-2 years at a time, until the warmth and sun re-appears. any kind of cool cataclismic event that darkens the skies and provides lots of biomass would make mushroom forests. any carbon rich source for example tar and oil volcanoes could cause giant mushrooms to have an advantage over trees. perhaps tsunamis wash away the forests every N years and make a mountain of wood someplace. mushrooms don't generate cellulose that's why they are not big. 

It would be cool if this entire planet could use zeppelin roadways instead of tarmac roads. Especially for countryside transport away from cities. A zeppelin for one person is about the size of a lorry, and with future materials, we can have fold-up, safe zepellins, with safety sensors, weather prediction, solar conversion. Negative buoyancy air transport will always use noisy big engines and fall down too fast, too noisy to replace cars and would disturb the forests. Can zeppelins replace cars one day? 

Avian predators are not that fascinating and can be killed easily by humans, it requires humans to be always in groups of 3 while moving, with spears, tomahawks, and so on. predators that put evolutionary pressure on humans from hunting havn't been seen, except for the fastest pack animals, wolves, lions, who use mostly scent, in fact all mammals have scent disadvantage. Animals that hunt in packs, (which would be fascinating) would be a cross between a locusts and bees, and swarming crows. Note that there are no flocks of eagles, because there could be, except that they could empty the entire ecosystem and flocking eagles would be so effective that they would starve themselves. A equally scientifically likely cause of a color change mutation would be sexual attractiveness, communication, and active hunting ability... There are different types of metachrosis, spiders even have it sometimes from to adapt to plant colors. The most cool is the chameleon. It has crystals similar to your nails and hair, contained in soft tissue, which can expand and contract and change density, probably platelets or grains of some kind, and depending on the squeeze, they can reflect light like an LCD crystal or petrol, in fact it's the same as a blue/green/red insect, which all have platelets in their shell which gives a metal reflection. Chameleons and insects can only do bright colors with protein horn material which is arranged in platelets similar in size to light wavelengths, check TEMicro pics for it... they have expanding melanin organules/cells, black to change them black. images here - $URL$ human eye color changes help humans to indicate the direction of prey and to communicate pathways or dangers without talking, and makes it easier for humans to communicate in groups as it avoids danger within a group. communication seems like a more likey cause for a color change. Humans with color change would be very communicative about mood and for hunting indications and dangers. long distance communication without waving hands about. So a human with color change would learn to talk, left right, now, later, etc with colors. The microbiology is difficult. if humans could do like squids they would have seaslug mucus skin because it would be so flexible and spongey. squids have muscle pores containing red,yellow, black white colors. you could say that they at first developed hair which had iridescent colors, like birds, or even feathers, and learnt to communicate by making color patterns with feathers or by turning their hair like petrol reflections or lcd cells and opals... that's oddly enough one of hte few physical pathways for that trait. So you haev to figure out a way for humans to show and hide freckles with hair or with other freckles that slide over the first freckles. the most likely way is for humans to develop chameleon skin, so essentially their freckles would become highly developed platelets and humans would have actual muscle or electricl signals going to their skin to make colors by changing platelets or freckles density/postion/rotation. mammals don't have bright colors, birds do, which is an illustration of the unlikelihood of it happening in mammals, even 60mn years of mouse generations didnt make red/blue/green mice. Evolutionary pressure by improved communication rather than simple camouglage amd mimickery, and mutation of human pigments to be similar to chameleons, is the mostly likely cause for humans. because human color blue green red is mostly in the eye, you can say that humans developed colors in their mucus membranes first, eyes, lips, like blue baboons even, and then they developed rgb hairs or even?
