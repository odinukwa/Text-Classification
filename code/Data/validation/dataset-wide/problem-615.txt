I have Shimano M785 hydraulic disc brakes. It is easy to remove the pads and put them back in again even with the disc in place. However, resetting the brake pistons is tricky. I currently use a butter knife and two hands, which mostly works but is very awkward. All the directions I've seen for resetting pistons (for example) call for removing the wheel. I'd would like to avoid this step if it's not essential; it transforms pad replacement or access to the pistons from a quick 5-minute job to one that requires a workstand and may be dirty due to chain contact. For example, this is relevant when diagnosing issues that require resetting the pads more than once, or perhaps in a shop where time is money. Is there a tool or technique that will let me do it easily without removing the wheel? 

My question is: where can I find something that will screw into the threads in the base of the pump and somehow lead to a modern Presta pump head? 

I have a 2004 Jamis Aurora with a 52/42/30 triple and an 11-32 cassette in the back. 30x32 (25.3 gear inches) being the lowest gear is frustrating for the hilly terrain where I live (e.g., 7% grade average over several miles, with higher local steepness), and so I'd like to lower my gearing. I'd like advice on how to most simply do this. The basic problem is that replacing any given part appears to have cascading compatibility issues which may or may not be solvable, and I'm becoming confused. I do use the full range up to 52x11 (127.6 gear inches), but only on descents that are fast anyway, so I am happy to lose the higher gears and coast instead. There is essentially no level terrain where I live. Relevant specs (all parts stock in 2004): 

The first uses a brake handle-mounted switch. The others use accelerometers to detect slowing. None of the major bike light manufacturers seem to offer a brake light. My question is, what's the disconnect? Am I misjudging the value of brake lights? Is there some challenge that makes them hard to offer for bicycles? 

In my neck of the woods there are some mountain descents that are pretty substantial: say 600 meters vertically averaging 7% grade, with lots of curves and other obstacles like potholes. Typically the surface is reasonable-quality asphalt; I have a touring bike. I’m curious if there are techniques or gadgets to moderate my speed, in order to lessen the need for braking (e.g., in a car one can downshift). As a back-of-the-envelope, computation, consider a 110kg rider/bicycle system coasting down a 7% grade at 50km/hour, or about 13 meters/second. Due to the grade, for every horizontal 13m, s/he descends 0.91m vertically; hence, every second, the potential energy of a 110kg mass dropping 0.91m is added to the bike & rider system and must be removed in order to not accelerate. That potential energy (U=mgh) is roughly 980 joules; i.e., the cyclist must dissipate about 1kW in order to not accelerate. This surprises me; it seems like a lot of energy to be dumping into the environment. But it's on par with what can be produced by racers to reach similar speeds on the flat. What I don't know how to compute is how much energy is consumed by air drag, mechanical friction in the bicycle, rolling resistance, etc., to know really what extra a slowing device would need to consume. One thing I thought of was a dynamo hub; but those seem to consume less than 5 watts, which would make no real difference. (I should add that I know I shouldn't brake continuously all the way down. My question is about whether there are additional things I can do or add to the bike to bleed off speed.) 

In general, a recently regreased hub tends to show more friction than it had before the regreasing. In normal circumstances, I would recommend giving it a spin during a ten-twenty kilometers ride and then would recheck if the friction is still bad. However… It is not clear how "enormous" the friction at that position is. If all the balls are new and the races did not look to be beaten to death or at least looked evenly worn, the only explanation I can imagine is that you've put more balls to one or both sides of the hub than necessary. Did you count amount of old balls per side? It is safer to set one ball less than optimal than to cram in one ball more. 

These rims should be compatible with the original 26" × 1.75" tires. Note that you asked about frame vs wheel rims compatibility. You also mention hubs that you want to use; frame/hub, fork/hub and hub/rim compatibility issues are different question. In particular, the chosen rim should have the same number of spoke holes as the hub has, and that hub comes with hole counts varying from 28 to 36. 

I assume it does. At least I do it all the time with an exception that I press both switches simultaneously, or at least without mentally dividing it into "first left, then right". And yes, it typically has the "two on the rear, one on the front" pattern to have a smooth transition. Sheldon Brown calls the technique "Double shifting". The goal is to achieve a half-step gearing. The huge teeth count difference on modern front chainring doubles explains why it requires a double rear-shift, otherwise the gearing jump is too big and unpleasant. 

What you need for drivetrain parts is called "a new groupset" — a name that encompasses all the parts I've mentioned. Converting the rear wheel to a new hub would require a complete wheel rebuild. Oftentimes it means that buying a new complete inexpensive rear wheel would be cheaper. 

You can remove two cogs 17, 19 and replace them with one new 18, and then add 26 to the end of the cassette. That would allow you to keep more evenly distributed gear steps in the middle. That is how certain modern 11-speed MTB cassette extenders are sold: along with the biggest 46 teeth cog they also pack something around 18 teeth. So this way two cogs go out and two go in. 

I have a full rigid (fat) bicycle and I am playing with an idea to use a suspension fork sometimes. I want to keep the possibility to swap the old fork back when I do not need suspension but want to drop weight instead. The swapping process does not have to be super-swift but it should be doable without special tools (i.e., only with a set of Allen keys). Almost like a wheel change, only with more steps. Now, a fork also carries certain hardware, besides the wheel. For example, I would either need two front disk brake calipers or move a single caliper between forks. Ditto for stem and top cap, mudguard, possibly fork's remote lockout or maybe something else. All of them can be moved with hexkeys. The headset's lower race is what I am worried about. It sits on top of a fork's crown and can be (re)mounted only using special tools, sometimes impact tools. I assume moving the race between two forks would not be easy and most likely reduce its lifespan. What are the best practices in this situation? Possible solutions that come to my mind. 

I find it easier to park my bike if I can remove one of its degrees of freedom, for example, prevent the wheels from rotating. An easy way to do this would be to strap one of the brake levers down. This would be for around 8–12 hours, 5–6 times per week. I have hydraulic disc brakes. The bike would be upright. I have a feeling that this is a bad idea. Is it? And if so, why? 

Add a larger cog in back, such as the new Shimano 12-36 cassette. As far as I can tell, this will require a new rear derailleur and a new chain, but that's it. This makes the lowest gear 30x36 (22.5 gear inches), 12.5% lower, and the highest 52x12 (117 gear inches). A downside is the excessive size of the rear cassette. Replace the crankset, for example with a 48-36-24. This makes the lowest gear 24x32 (20.3 gear inches), 25% lower, and the highest 48x11 (118 gear inches). At first glance, this one is the most appealing, but it seems to also raise the thorniest compatibility questions; the ones I'm aware of so far are (a) finding a front derailleur which is compatible with both my road shifters and the smaller large chainring (one possibility), and (b) differing chainline offsets of road and MTB cranksets. Swap in a lower granny chainring, say 24 teeth, resulting in a 52/42/24 crankset. My concerns here are (a) whether my derailleur can handle the 18-tooth jump between low and middle and/or the lowness of the granny gear, (b) the awkwardly wide jump between low and middle (75%, or about 5 sprockets), and (c) retaining very high gears that are feasible only for making a fast descent faster. Swap in 3 new chainrings. This seems to raise similar concerns to item 2. 

I’ve discovered in my parts box some rim brake pads that have been there for several years. Aside from age, they are in fine shape (some are new). Can I put these on my bike, or is there hidden damage? In other words, how long do stored rim brake pads remain safe? 

I have a square taper bottom bracket. How can I tell whether it is a J.I.S. or ISO taper with a minimum amount of disassembly? FWIW, it's a Ritchey from 2004. However, it would be nice to get answers that apply to other brands as well. 

My understanding is that it’s important to regularly test one’s brakes, by grabbing the lever and squeezing it hard, perhaps all the way down to the bars. The theory is that if they’re going to fail, it’s far better that they do so on the workstand than during a panic stop. My question: does this testing itself cause wear or damage? And if so, how can I mitigate or compensate for it? To clarify: This test is designed to see if anything is broken, not tightened sufficiently, etc., rather than “do the brakes stop the bike”. For example, this weekend I discovered that the cable had worn down over a corner [aside: I have an appointment to re-route the cable] by breaking it during this test. 

The difference between handlebars, or in general body postures on bicycle, starts to show itself at distances of 50 km. For 5 kilometers a day, which I assume consist of two intervals of 2.5 km each (to work and back), it really does not matter. I would say gearing would play more difference than type of bike. 

It happened to me once that a V-brake pad that sat too low relative to the rim's braking surface literally wedged itself down into the rim at braking. To alleviate this, reposition both pad's position and angle. Always make sure that it clears the tire, because otherwise braking friction will destroy the sidewall in no time. 

If the AC/DC convert is a simple rectifying bridge plus filter and voltage stabilizer, it should work with a direct current source as well. The only question is how many batteries connected serially you will need to reach the minimum acceptable voltage. Given that specifications for your lamp say to use 6 V A/C you can go with four AA batteries or two 18650 accumulators. 

Have you considered cable pull adapter that would allow you use both MTB shifter and present road front derailleur? Jtek Shiftmate 7 seems to do what you need. I have not used any such adapters myself yet but I thought you should need about such possibility. 

It would require changing the complete drivetrain and the rear wheel. However, the good news are that a freewheel coming with 7-speed Shimano cassettes is compatible with 10-speed systems, so you won't need changing the rear hub/wheel. The reason why the complete drivetrain has to be changed is that the front chainrings may not be working well with a narrower 10-speed chain. 

Bicycle mechanical cables has not changed much since 1990's. The main difference between brake cables and shifting cables is in diameters. Shifters use 1.2 mm wire and brakes use 1.5 mm wire. Both types should also have matching housing. Brake cables have different "heads" types — barrel (for MTB) or a drop (for road). Make sure you use the same type of cable end as your shifter accepts. Some brake cables have both types of heads on different sides of the cable so you just need to cut it properly. Any decent cable sets will do. You can find complete sets of cables and housings sold together, along with small ferrules and other minor stuff that may or may not be useful for mounting them on a particular bike. Note that if you want to change parts of a drivetrain, it is better to be all its parts. It is well known that e.g. older chain and newer cassette work noticeably worse (read: noisy as hell) than an old chain and old cassette. The drivetrain parts are: front chainrings, rear cassette and chain. One can buy a complete groupset that may even include shifters, but it will definitely be more expensive than a 100$. Do not forget that number of front and rear gears may differ greatly on bikes, and so the shifters must match. Unless visibly damaged, your shifters may be alright, if a little rusty. It is the friction in the old cables that makes shifting hard. You should definitely look at the brake pads and change them. These things are cheap, and there are not very many types used with rim brakes, so you should easily find a substitute. That is, provided your bike has rim brakes. Overhauling the brakes is recommended in any case. The same goes with tires — if they look bulgy or cause a lot of punctures, they should be replaced.
