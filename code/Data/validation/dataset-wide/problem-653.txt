I take it you are talking about the process of loading the bike, not when the bike is up there and the car is in movement (since most bike racks have a kind of trough that keeps the front wheel aligned). What I have done on occasion is to loosen the handlebar and turn it backwards about 75 degrees relative to the fork. The handlebar is then more or less aligned with the front wheel. Re-tighten the handlebar in this position. Then a bungee or other elastic material can be used to fix the handlebar to the horizontal frame bar. This does mean using an Allen key in most cases, but I figure it is worth getting the key out. 

I would start by considering avoiding the use of a trailer hitch for any other purpose than that for which it has been designed: hitching a trailer. Hitches are constructed to support lateral, longitudinal and vertical forces applied at low heights, the latter up to about 50kg - think a maximum of two bikes and the rack itself. However, they are not built to withstand torque applied either side-to-side or front-to-back. The other vehicle attachment points will have to stand that - but these points are usually on the tailgate which is also not built for that particular purpose. The safest way I know of transporting bikes on a (perhaps long) trip is inside a rather non-descript van, with no windows potential thiefs can see through and doors that lock. Perhaps you could consider renting such a vehicle? I am sure you can get quite good prices by shopping around and choosing a time frame in which businesses typically do not need to rent many vehicles, e.g. in summer. HTH. 

As has been pointed out, closed brakes are not ideal from the standpoint of disipating the energy built up through friction. This has also been experienced in the automotive world, where drum brakes were standard during many decades. Some would say they still are, e.g. on rear axels of light commercial vehicles such as pick-up trucks. However, although there have been accidents (even truck accidents) at times, they seem to have occurred mostly in mountain regions and with drivers at the wheel who were not used to driving in such conditions. Mountain drivers are/were used to "listening" to the feel of their brakes, and knowing when to back off, slow down -or even stop completely, and take a break- before the brakes became completely non-responsive. This is less of a problem with disk brakes, as they have larger areas in contact with ambient air, air circulates more rapidly around them, and the areas that actually generate heat (where the pads rest) are completely exposed to the air. Bicycle caliper brakes are a bit of the same, but even better in the sense that the metal getting heated has even more area (the whole wheel rim). However, caliper brakes are applied to the outside of the wheel, and not near to the axis such as with disk brakes. This has its drawbacks (more tendency to go over the front wheel), which is probably why dirt track descent riders all go with disk brakes. I would tend to think all types of brakes could serve your purpose well, but that hub brakes will need more attention from you, specially when going down long descents. You will need to stop more often, to let them cool off. On the other hand, you seem to be familiar with them already, and you will be on holiday, so... Have a nice trip! 

I have a new steel frame which I am building up. I intend to rust proof this first by using Waxoyl made by Hammerite which I will use on the inside of the frame and forks. Should I use this on the outside of the steerer column ie under the stem etc? I am worried about the stem slipping with this substance being oil based. If not is there any way that I can rust proof the outside of the steerer column? Thanks in advance. 

I have a set of Avid Shorty 4 cantilever brakes, well two sets (front and back) and wish to upgrade the pads. These are centre pull, linear pull brakes and have brake pads which are mounted from the centre, ie the post (which is threaded) is centred in the pad. Looking for new pads I see that there is a much wider variety of v-brake pads than cantilever pads. As v-brakes are a subset of cantilever brakes can I use v-brake blocks with my cantilever brakes? I note these tend to have more brake pad at the back of the mounting post than at the front of the pad. I would also like if possible cartridge mounted pads any recommendations would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance. 

I personally think that the wear issue is not as simple as one size chain being better than the other. Whilst this may be the case, it will all depend on the quality of the products involved ie cog, chainring and chain. 

I don't have an electric bike either. I do a commute of just under this distance each way every day and when used to it this distance is no issue. The problem I see with electric bikes is when resorting to pedalling only whether through desire or necessity you are "carrying" a hell of a lot of extra weight on top of the weight of the bike. I totally agree with the suggestions made by Kibbee. 

Ghost shifting is generally caused by the frame flexing, not by friction in the cables. Other causes can be a poorly fitting or too short cable housing. Something is causing the length of the cable between the stops to change. Cleaning the cable run and using a teflon coated shift cable won't hurt and might alleviate the problem if it's a combo of bottom bracket flex and sticky guide. When this is the cause the problem tends to be very intermittent and only occurs when standing on the pedals to climb. However, as Daniel R Hicks suggests, check the frame carefully for cracks. An aluminum alloy frame of that age that has seen a lot of miles is at the end of it's usable life. If you can't find any cracks, examine the cable housing runs carefully. The cable housing ends should not move at all in the stops when shifting or turning the handlebars. Check the derailleur hanger to make sure it's not loose. The part you are looking at is called a Bottom Bracket Cable Guide, but your's looks just fine. They rarely wear out, shift cables aren't under much tension, so a plastic slider is plenty slippery enough. On an old enough bike, they are made of metal. 

There is a very handy gizmo that you can use with road derailleurs to increase the size of cog you can use in the back. Wolf Components Road Link I use it on one of my bikes to have a 11-32 rear cassette. The cassette spacing on Shimano 10spd is the same between road and mtb, so you should be able to just replace your current cassette with an MTB one. You will still be within the safe range of the capability of your rear derailleur. Long cage Road derailleurs generally have 39t capacity, so 16+ 21 = 37. So you could even go to an 11/34 MTB cassette. You can safely go beyond the capacity of the derailleur if you avoid small/small gear usage, However, that's hard to do with a compact double up front. Another solution that I think you might prefer is to switch to a smaller crankset up front. For most people 46/30 and 11/28 in the back makes a really good setup. Unfortunately, 46/30 cranks are not the easiest thing to obtain, but that is changing with the popularity of "Gravel" bicycle components. FSA makes a nice 46/30 "adventure" crankset and you can get those chainrings with MTB cranksets like the Shimano 10spd XT double. 

I agree with Snikrs and also ride a steel fixed gear frame in often wet UK. I recently purchased my current frame (upgrade the old one didn't rust through) and before using it sprayed the inside of the frame with Waxoyl but if I had been able to find it in the UK would probably have used J.P. Weigle's Frame Saver which many people swear by. What I don't like about Waxoyl is it remains quite slimy, I'm not sure if it would be good in a hot climate but it would be better than nothing. You have to be careful in the seat post area and clean it out to allow the frame to grip the seat post. But if done with care its not an issue. I usually just wipe the seat post with an old greasy rag to prevent it sticking in the frame. It is also important to move the seat post every now and again (3 months maybe) as a stuck seat post can be really hard to remove. The other precautions I took before riding the frame were: 

The one step I didn't follow in the Bike Radar article was drilling a hole in the bottom bracket shell. I couldn't bring myself to put a hole in my nice new frame even though its not a flash one. I suspect plugging all holes before ever ridding may negate the need for this but I will inspect the bottom bracket shell after a few very wet rides. If you do drill a hole remember this will open the frame up to rust so paint it or varnish it. Finally keep on to of scratches. I usually apply clear nail varnish as you can never get a perfect colour matched paint. I hope this helps. 

Stuck a large rubber bung in the base of the steerer column to prevent water entering here (even though I have mudguards). I had to shorten the bung slightly to prevent it showing. My saddle clamp encloses the top of the seat post if this wasn't the case I would fill this in a similar manner. This is something I have done on all my frames for the last 20 or more years. Filled every bolt hole with a bolt ensuring ample waterproof grease was applied to the threads. Teflon grease is not great at this I find it gets washed out easily. Marine grease is much better, I use Unipart Marine but there are loads available; they are all considerably cheaper than any proprietary bike grease and I use mine for most applications (hubs, headsets etc) and it last much longer between applications (I commute every day in all weathers). Filled all drain holes as described in step 3 of the Bike Radar winter proofing article. For my frame match sticks were way too small. I used chopsticks, I found snipping approx 3-5 mm off the end and then cutting 5 mm of chopstick was a perfect fit and pretty flush to the frame. Before pushing into the hole I coated in the wood in clear nail varnish (not mine) and then again over the top and overlapping slightly onto the frame once inserted. This varnish prevents water absorption and helps create a seal without using glue. Finally before fitting the bottom bracket I coated the threads of the shell and its interior with the waterproof grease even though already sprayed with Waxoyl. 

Yes, it's perfectly safe to use the next larger size tube in a smaller tire. It's a common trick used by bike messengers to reduce the chance of flats. The only downside is a slightly heavier wheel since you're using more tube that you really need. 

4 chainrings seems to be the feasible limit: $URL$ However if you add an internal planetary gear setup, A 100 speed might be possible if not practical. Here's a 63 speed bike. $URL$ There are internally geared 2speed front axles. $URL$ So in theory 8x is possible on the front, 12 on the back gets you close to 100. You could go 14 in the back with a Rolhoff hub and get over 100. I suspect such a bike would self-destruct in a very few miles though. Internal gear systems aren't engineered for the kind of forces that gearing could generate. 

The primary difference between a road bike and a CX bike is the size of the tires. You can ride your road bike anywhere your skills will allow. There are some gotcha's though. Skinny tires only have so much traction. Gravel flats won't be an issue for all but the lightest of race tires, but pinch flats from hitting larger rocks at high speed are a problem. Dirt and high end road components don't mix well. But seeing exactly how far you can take a road bike has a long history and many local clubs have "grasshopper" rides that link up old gravel roads. Your bike is capable of much more than you might think. Look up the races Paris-Roubaix and Strada Bianca. 

We need to see what is under the cable stops. My guess is that is is probably a standard squared off shifter boss, but you never know. If it looks like this
