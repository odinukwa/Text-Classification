Yes, the Cretaceous was the last time atmospheric carbon dioxide was significantly higher than it is today, (and this, of course, depends to a degree on what you interpret by significantly higher) It's very hard to be definite, because the error-bars on the estimates become large, as we look back in time. However, as the first graph below, which aggregates the results of several studies, shows, the last time it was significantly higher what it is today, was around the Cretaceous period, denoted by K. As far as we can tell, current levels are higher than they've been for 15 million years. Now "significantly higher" isn't very specific. Current levels are around 390ppm, up from around 280ppm before the industrial age started. So what's significantly higher? Let's say 800-1000ppm would be significantly higher (2-2.5 times current levels), and as far as we can tell, the last time atmospheric CO2 concentrations were that high, was indeed the Cretaceous period (which ended 65 million years ago). (note that the present day is on the left in this graph). 

This is a story of cannibalism in a snowed-in mountain pass, from the American western pioneer days. There are a number of websites and much historical lore in California advocating the theory that the ill-fated Donner party resorted to cannibalism. However, there is also an article on Discovery News Donner Party Ate Family Dog, Maybe Not People: Did ethnic prejudice spur the now infamous legend of the Donner Party's cannibalism? So which is it? Did they eat the forbidden flesh or not? Here is a large amount of background and accounts of cannibalism that I have picked through from the fairly long wikipedia article on the Donner Party. From wikipedia:Donner Party 

Probably not. The idea, if not the exact phrase, goes back at least to the Roman empire. According to $URL$ and $URL$ Quintus Horatius Flaccus, the Roman poet, wrote: 

Yes. But it is out of circulation and no longer used. According to "How this school's old anti-rape poster sparked new controversy" in the The Daily Dot, an internet community newspaper with an ethics policy emphasizing accuracy: 

From: "Indirect health effects of relative humidity in indoor environments." by Arundel et al, 1986: 

Let's look at those two, within the context of the EU ETS, the cap & trade scheme under discussion. From Edie Energy, reporting on the UK Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee: 

10,000 km2 x 0.24 GW/km2 x 21% = 500 GW Which is more than current US electricity consumption of 425 GW. So yes, the area shown is reasonable, as a visualisation of the surface area of panels required to generate electricity equal to total US electricity consumption, on a multi-year average. 

Skeptical Science analysis of the paper Initial thoughts on the Watts et al draft A cooling bias due to MMTs? Menne et al 2009 Quayle et al 1991 "When I had done my own initial assessment of this a few years ago, I had used TOBS versions and am annoyed with myself for not properly considering this factor. I should have noticed it immediately. That will teach me to keep to my practices of not rushing. Anyway, now that I’m drawn into this, I’ll have carry out the TOBS analysis, which I’ll do in the next few days " from McIntyre's blog McIntyre claimed to have reproduced a hockey stick from red noise. However, what he did was generate 10,000 sets of red noise, and then filter down to just the 100 of these that most resembled a hockey-stick, for his paper. 7a 7b 7c 7d 

[ my descriptions, as titles are uncited in source article ] Have these murals been on public display to travelers at the Denver International Airport? In $URL$ which seems to contain conspiracy theory material, a large section is devoted to Denver International Airport. Some claims, though repeated, about Denver's airport are so bizarre they seem like hoax material that no one would seriously believe: 

The first paragraph contains the weasel word "could". Of course they could. In a way it would not be terribly surprising, one might expect such an opportunity to be seized when monitoring serious criminal or terrorist activity if due process permits. The second paragraph says that this is "among the NSA's most productive operations". To me, that implies that they do this a lot, and/or that it has obtained notable results. However, from Fox this is now 3rd hand information (Document --> Der Spiegel --> Fox) and I wondered about credibility of such a document that the news article itself does not identify. Also, another portion of the article claims that US products contain known exploits that secret agencies are well aware of -- indicating to me that physically intercepting a new computer order would perhaps be unnecessary. Can a hidden source reasonably support a claim of hardware interception? Are there any other credible reports that support this claim? 

What: The first is which emissions one includes: just CO2, or the Kyoto basket, or all significant greenhouse gases. And how thorough one is in measuring emissions from land use, land use-changes and forestry (LULUCF), and of fugitive emissions from extraction, transmission and distribution systems, and flaring Where: Whether one attributes fossil fuels emissions at the point of extraction (rare, but not unprecedented), or the point of combustion. When: What time horizon one selects: and that's because the ratio of greenhouse gases, and in particular the ratio of methane to CO2, varies between countries; and the global warming potential of methane, relative to CO2, varies significantly, depending on whether one uses a 20-year horizon (56:1), 100 years (20:1), 500 years (6.5:1), or whatever. 

Here are the findings from a study from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC pdf) They used a twin-house setup: two identical houses with different settings for the heating. The findings: 

Wikipedia cites additional details, treating this tragedy as a conventional blast caused by recklessness in loading munitions. The nuclear theory is mentioned but not advocated. see: Wikipedia Port Chicago Disaster. 

Summary: The electric shocks given to "victims" in the experiment were fake. A "scientist" ordered "assistant" participants to apply higher and higher voltages; measuring these participants' willingness to obey authority was the true objective. Some of these participants suffered psychological effects such as emotional discomfort, uncontrolled laughter, and anxiety including anxiety over future life choices such as participating in the military. There are no credible, widely-reported incidents of anyone being institutionalized or committing suicide as a result of the experiment. Nevertheless, the experiment is infamous and helped others advocate for stronger ethical standards in human subject research. Wikipedia uses the term "inflicted insight" (notice also the mention of deception): 

Makes trying to improve the state of affairs sound rather hopeless, doesn't it? Others think that mitigating or reversing the effects of global warming might be possible: At the US Department Of Energy's Ask a Scientist website (which I realize pales on peer review compared to PNAS...), some creative solutions are offered by a visitor and the scientists who reply: 

the binding upper bound is always reached - that within such a scheme we never undershoot; and therefore that the binding limit for the following period does not take any account of undershoot of any previous caps. 

No, it should not be convincing to anyone who cares about using data meaningfully and scientifically. Raw ambient temperature data is seldom useful in and of itself. Particularly when: 

In "Radiocarbon evidence indicates that migrants introduced farming to Britain", cited in the above paper, Collard et al found that (from the abstract): 

By ignoring all of those changes, by stripping out the data corrections as Watts et al do, information is stripped from the data. So whatever is claimed to be shown by the uncorrected data, is no longer meaningful. No conclusions can be taken from Watts et al. Not about underlying trends, nor about urban heat islands, nor about differing trends at high-quality and low-quality stations. The only thing the paper shows is that its authors have failed to do rigorous scientific analysis. Sources 

Of course, if the blast were nuclear, one might reasonably wonder: Where was the fallout? Where were the radiation casualties? This appears to be a weak point of these claims. The Martin article claims that Contra Costa county, where the blast occurred, has "one of the highest rates of cancer in the United States". A hobbyist and self-proclaimed skeptic went looking for residual radiation, and found a little, in 2004-2005. Background Radiation Measurements near Port Chicago Were the detonation of 4100 metric tons of explosives, possibly with 800,000 liters+ of fuel oil sufficient to cause the explosion described, or should the nuclear option be given serious consideration? If nuclear, this raises other questions such as "accidental event" or "intentional test" -- but the only claim being questioned here is whether the blast was nuclear. 

I have no idea what the graphic in the original post depicts (are those armed men? is that a weapon being fired? a flashlight amplified by night vision? or just a white line?). Dropping it into google image search yielded some news articles, including this one about a clash between police and protestors that could be translated to English with Google Translate. The picture and text does not suggest itself to be an official source of knowledge on the Armenian Constitution but rather a commentary or protest of some sort. 

tl;dr: No, it is not cheaper. The unit cost of the Hyperloop is higher. And to understand why, we need to take a step back, and think about what the proposed infrastructure is for. It is for moving people about. So the costs can only make sense, if we bear in mind how many people will be moved. According to the 2012 Business Plan, the high-speed train capacity would be 12,000 people per hour in each direction (p6). They derate this for a 70% occupancy to 8,400 people per hour in each direction. Conversely, the Hyperloop would, according to Ars Technica, move 28 passengers at 2-minute intervals, which would be 840 people per hour in each direction. If we derate by the same 70% occupancy factor, that's 588 people per hour in each direction. So although the capital costs are about one-tenth of the costs of high-speed rail, the ridership would be much less than one-tenth of the high-speed train. So the unit costs of the Hyperloop are higher. Essentially, the nub of it comes down to the Hyperloop being super-fast low-capacity infrastructure; the train is fast higher-capacity infrastructure. Now, there's a lot of assumptions in those calculations: the high-speed train works on the basis of trains every 5 minutes, but they could be more frequent. The hyperloop claims to be able to work at 30-second intervals at peak, but given the speeds and stopping times, that looks completely unrealistic. But one could tweak the numbers to make the Hyperloop look better, at a cost per passenger basis. However, the world has quite a lot of experience of building and operating high-speed trains. It has very little experience of bulding and runnning anything like the Hyperloop. Therefore, cost overruns are much more probable, and more likely to be much higher, for the Hyperloop than for the train.
