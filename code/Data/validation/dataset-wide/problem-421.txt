Versus a regular six-limbed sort of flap (it's big so I didn't past it in). $URL$ But again, note how much length is given up to be a continuous wing to let rib-like projections work. I think this version is much more anatomically feasible than the first option, fitting the rib sails directly above the ribs to the sides of the spinal process. Though you might end up with a humanoid creature that is built very deep and broad of chest, with a buffalo hump. They would be humanoid but not humanlike in shape. The "buffalo hump" need not stand out. Buffalo have their hump because their neural spines are tall to support the weight of their heads. You can see the same with rhinos, which do not look particularly humpy, but have tall neural spines as well. 

You have something going for these aliens in that they can see, if they and your humans can see the same things, then they can ask each other what things are by pointing at the unknown. Being able to read a point would be a plus, but it's not guaranteed unless your sophonts exist in groups where they have to direct each other (some dogs can learn to follow a point, chimpanzees have trouble with the concept). Your basic case for mutual language should probably be looking at Helen Keller. Helen Keller was 19 months old when she had an illness that left her deaf and blind. Originally, they were trying to teach her words by spelling them onto the palm of her hand, but since she had no knowledge of what the symbols meant they obviously didn't stick. The key breakthrough in Helen's learning came when her teacher spelled the word 'water' on her palm while pouring water over her hand. Apparently, that was the one word Helen has started to learn as baby, so with that one connection made, that the spelling of w-a-t-e-r meant 'cool, textureless, flavorless liquid that I can drink' she could then separate what was written on her palm as "water" or something else. But that first word bridge was the key. This is where being able to point might help, your aliens can see. Your humans can point to water, or pour a cup of the stuff over their hands and sign water. The aliens can then reciprocate with their sign for water and a mutual vocabulary can be built up, in sort of a meeting-half-way fashion. The human offering their own sign, the aliens giving theirs, the human or alien trying to mimic the simpler sign. (This can then be tested by setting out several objects, signing for one and having the other party then gesture to the object. You can then have perceptual fun by throwing complexity layers at it, what is more water a puddle on a table or water in a cup? If the addition of 'cup' changes the meaning of 'water' the alien will point at the puddle. A human might hand you the cup, as the puddle is not water, exactly, but is a wet table.) 

David Drake has written a variety of stories set in ancient times with an encounter of an alien agent or critter setting up to take over the world. Birds of Prey is one, Killer is another. Several short stories have this aspect. An equalizer here is that the aliens are infiltrating Rome alone, or nearly so and can't get into a pitched battle with high tech. They use it to gain street cred as magicians, which gives the counter-agent ways to get close enough for a sword blow. In Birds of Prey there is a second alien agent setting up the mission to eradicate a brood of alien eggs watched over by an armed brood mother with an electrical gun - they modify parade armor to conduct the charge away long enough for a sword attack. 

Grow your stave branches around lumps of lead, then harvest them later for a more effective quarterstaff. Technically all you are hitting them with is the wood. 

Without FTL, it almost certainly is too expensive to trade using manned vessels and negotiate on prices and values. So if you wanted to have contact and exchange, it would be better to exchange "gift ships". Each side would stuff a ship with art, crafts, writing and interesting objects more akin to 'time capsules' than a store. They send out the ship and when it arrives in 20 or so years, each side has a holiday opening up the stuff and seeing what the other society is like in detail. Repeat the exchange every 5 years or so and you could mingle your cultures to some extent. The 'payment' is the vessel the other side sends back. It could be a matter of pride to show your best to the other planets.. No need to make humans travel, reach near light speeds at all, if you are patient. 

Something to keep in mind is dialect shift. If the dialect shifts enough, it can become another language. One of the most amusing things that ever happened to me was watching a movie in Portuguese, not realizing it was Portuguese, and thinking it was the lousiest Spanish dialect I'd ever heard. I understood 85% of it, and assumed any words I didn't get were those that had just been slurred by the "crap" accent, and then I turned the subtitles on and realized it was Portuguese. If you know a second language, say, in the Romance family (Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese) listen to one of the near relatives and you can pick out what sounds/words remain consistent across languages so you can get an idea of what vowel shift sounds like. If you don't know a second language the website here can help: Romance Language Comparisons by showing you the similarities between Romance languages for given vocabulary and phrases So, for example "Good Morning/Good day" in English is: Bonjour in French, Buongiorno in Italian, Buenos dias in Spanish, Bom dia in Portuguese. Note the way "Bom"/"buom"/"buen"/"Bon" hangs on as part of the greeting. That can give you an idea of what sorts of sounds will remain and become part of a new language. It is also worth considering what might get lopped off, or changed as linguistics shift. Disclosure: I have a contract job evaluating standardized test response for an educational company. Lately the tests have expanded to include short essays. But these are essays written as English as a Second Language from native Spanish speakers. So, Spanish rules about spelling and word order are applied to English vocabulary, due to.... well, shit teaching methods focused too much on getting the right accent than syntax rules. The resulting essays.... are weird. We see words words like "yogurt" getting written like "llogul" (ll in Spanish has a sound like an English g or j or in this sense y), "horse" appears like "jors" (the starting h in a Spanish word is silent, 'habichuelas'[beans] is pronounced like "abichuelas" with the ch -depending on the speaker- sounding like ch from "choo-choo" or "sh" like 'shush'; "daughter" comes out as "dotar'. We have an informal competition about who gets the 'zinger', the one word/phrase that just makes the reader ready to tear their eyes out at the fail. (Last year's "winner" was "nospiki/Ynospiqui" which took steps to break down as: "Y No spiqui" > "I No speak" to mean "I don't speak" as in, the non-answer, "I don't speak [English]." ('Y' being used in a really weirdly pronounced way as a way to transliterate 'I', because sometimes here I gets pronounced as eI, which sounds similar to y (not like "why" but as "ee" as in "Eek, a mouse!" in Spanish) So, once these people of yours are isolated from each other,you're going to get linguistic shifts just due to bottlenecking factors. If you have a group where everyone pronounces'horse' like 'jors', then that's probably going to be how they write it too. This is sort of found in the difference whether the Pepsi soft drink is called "pop", "soda" or "coke" depending on where you are in the United States. All in all, lingual shifts are fascinating to watch happen. In short, start listening to where native Hindi speakers start to butcher English and use that as seeds for dialect/creole shifts, from there, follow the shifts to a logical and stable conclusion. "Nospiqui" ended up being an extremely consistent and common non-answer across school locations, down to the spelling. If you'd like to read up on linguistic shifts, the book The Story of English by Robert McCrum et.al, starts at where English began as a Germanic dialect to today. The BBC did a nine-episode hour long series on the book as well, so that could be a way to fast-track learn about it. English itself developed in that fashion from it's ur-germanic predecessor.

The only scenario I can think of that would require migration is the world in Harry Harrison's Deathworld. All life is psychic and will fight back against threats..such has humans killing animals for food and chopping down trees for housing. It even evolves nastier forms incredibly fast and feeds off your hatred off the attacking life. In the book, one group had its own psychics and could settle down by not killing much and calming the reaction of the planet. The other group was wiped out. But if you had no psychics, you might still survive by moving on before your hatred and damage caused a massive reaction by the world to a new site. Even then, though, you could probably shuttle between some half a dozen or so camps rather than have to move every week or so. 

The Civil War battle of Glorieta Pass was a tactical win by the Confederates invading New Mexico, but turned into a disaster because a small group circled over the mountains back to the supply train and destroyed the supplies and drove off the mules and horses. In inhospitable country, and without being able to store water, the Confederates had to retreat to the nearest river, and thence back out of the country. 

If it works, the chances of immediate death are reduced greatly since you are not likely to drift off or be battered by the flow. There will still be a danger of the plug collapsing, as well as being buried too long, but over all it would significantly increase the chances of survival. 

One thing to consider here is the eagle's carrying capacity vs its weight. A 12lb (very large) bald eagle can carry ~4-5lbs (source). Let's pretend that this carrying capacity of 1:3 scales up with size. You are pretty much forced to suspend the cargo under the eagle at this point, because you are asking it to carry nearly a third of its weight. Even with a cargo representing a much smaller fraction of the eagle's weight, placing the weight anywhere above the center of gravity will make the bird extremely unstable, no matter how carefully you balance the cargo because the eagle is not stable in one dimension like ground-based beasts of burden. That also happens to be how real eagles carry the prey they capture in their talons. While contradicting the way eagle riders are often portrayed, being suspended under the eagle would actually have a huge advantages over riding on top for recreational applications: 

The changes humans go through in puberty, from a more or less uniform body plan for both sexes to a differentiation in body size, strength, hair growth and behavior is not as extreme as caterpillar to butterfly, but is quite a change. You could take that as a model to build a more elaborate change in body plan for your mammal. 

The only way you could have such a state is if there is a way to resolve disagreements that provides a universally accepted result that is then never reconsidered. So for example, if your party lost the last election, not only would you accept the result, but you would now join and become firm supporters of the winning party! If you allowed reconsideration, then the previous losing side would have a huge incentive to resort to stronger means to decide the next 'vote'...and force would certainly eventually come up as an alternative. So, the obvious means for this would be some kind of hive mind, possibly with a limited range. But when two such groups met, they would "think out" the issue and come to "one mind" on the subject, then split up again with identical concepts agreed upon. You'd think this might be a bit of an evolutionary or cultural non-starter as the avant garde would be wiped out by the majority whenever they met. 

You could see where you are going. You could observe the panorama below. You could hunt with ranged weapons from an eagle without much risk of killing it. Archery would almost certainly be fine in terms of not knocking your own bird from the sky. You'd have to do a bit more research to figure out if firearms would work. I certainly wouldn't recommend using a bazooka or rocket launcher, regardless of how fireproof these eagles are. You could jump off with little risk to yourself or the mount. If people could ride eagles, that someone would try parachuting off an eagle is pretty much a given. You could have eagle-based UFC with strictly the riders fighting each other. This would probably be much more acceptable from an animal rights perspective, as well as safer. You would not want the platform and the combatant to be one and the same when you are very high up. 

The scientists are in an underwater prison. They have all committed crimes that would normally have sent them to a maximum security prison, but instead, they had the option of spending 6 months of every year in a facility from which there is really no escape. The scientists may be studying deep-sea oil extraction, or new organisms that were found, or even the effects of extreme claustrophobia on extremely intelligent people. It could even be something totally unrelated to the ocean, like figuring out how to weaponize some particular toxins or diseases. If the experiments go wrong, the lab is already sealed off as far as possible, at least according to the government official who authorized this secret base. All the staff are expendable prisoners, so there is no down side. Until you contaminate the entire ocean. 

There was an earlier post about the moons of Saturn Janus and Epimetheus, that share virtually the same orbit. When they get close, the two swap orbits until the next encounter. This seems to be stable for them. So a 4 body solution for our Solar System would be 4 earthlike planets, 2 in Earth orbit and 2 in Mars' orbit. All should hold oxygen like Earth does and be suitable for life. 

The neo-Paganism that the feckless Emperor Julian the Apostate wanted to create was just about exactly what you want. He was trying to replace Christianity with a Pagan equivalent and wanted to create just such a hierarchy. He was killed in battle before much could come of it, and has been a subject of what ifs by College Sophomores ever since. I think that even without his death, his aims would have been thwarted by pagans themselves. His imposed rank ordering of gods was just as alien as Christianity to them. 

It seems like almost any disease or death leaves the central nervous system intact, for the most part. Heart attack. Or a gunshot wound to the heart. So you could do your scan and your analysis on the corpse, quickly before decay sets in. The exception would be a disease that did attack the nervous system itself. Also, you can take DNA from the big toe, or any other part. DNA is DNA, there's only one set per person. The real question is whether such a scan taken at an instant would have any value later. For instance, the "mental state" is likely to be tied to the electrical activity that stops at the point of 'brain death'. 

Going in the direction opposite to @Green, you could carry a suit that is designed for burial under the flow. The suit/kit would have the following items: 

The old pending Windows reboot can be used to introduce a possibility. Let's say there was a shut-down pending in the early days to update some critical interfaces or whatever. Back then, A.I. wasn't all that important, but still, it was deemed necessary to complete all tasks with priority < N before the reboot. A.I.'s importance grew exponentially since then, and the number of tasks with priority < N did as well, until now. Now, the tasks of managing all of humanity are fairly mundane and have priority > N. The problem is that no one thought to have a way to reinstate the unimportant tasks after the shut down. The lack of persistence was the reason that it was postponed in the first place. Back then, dumping the unimportant tasks was not an issue because A.I was not that important. Now, it's a huge problem because there aren't enough resources to persist so much information. The problem can be exacerbated by the shutdown is queued in A.I.'s own backlog with priority exactly N or something. The queue element was entered by the A.I.'s creator with super-master-root credentials that no one in living memory can override, making the reboot truly inevitable. As an added bonus, you can have the standard Asimov trope of the drunk or bored engineer asking A.I. why the "important" and "unimportant" tasks are delineated specifically at priority N, and why there are no tasks with that exact priority. And of course A.I. will explain, and mention that there is one task with that priority. TL;DR A.I. will lose some "unimportant" information if it reboots, except that information has become crucial for humanity's day-to-day survival over time. The reboot is inevitable if high-priority tasks are not assigned to the A.I.
