This could vary a lot, like depending on whether they were holding their breath. However, generally it's believed that a person could recover from this with little to no permanent damage. Probably the biggest risks are lung damage due to pressure differences, the bends and other related complications, and brain damage due to oxygen deprivation. 

19390101 is the date (1939-01-01). The first zero (Marked as SC) is the station code, the second the recorded hour, and the third the recorded minute (H/M). Most of this is 0 due to being interpolated data. After this information, there are 72 remaining columns (numbered 1-72 above), which represents collected data consolidated in groups of 5 degrees, presumably starting at 0. Given the amount of interpolation of old data the value may be questionable, but newer data appear to be more complete. The data format might be a little overwhelming to work with, but you can organize it in excel quite easily - paste it in and each line break will form a row, then use the text-to-column function to break each data into its own column. 

It is possible but unlikely. Here is a really good 'Science 2.0' article about the possibility ($URL$ Essentially, you likely wouldn't see the light on Moon settlements because there would need to have many thousands of bright lights and windows- both of these would be impractical on a moon base (windows let in radiation and are expensive, and bright lights waste valuable power). Furthermore, in order to reach a magnitude of brightness to constitute as visible, there would have to be a very large amount settlements concentrated together. 

I can't really rely on any specific source for this, but presumably exposure of an extremity would be perfectly survivable. I'm not quite sure how this would work as it would be very difficult to partially expose someone to a vacuum. The human body isn't exactly leak proof. In theory, you would begin to exhibit symptoms in the exposed body part, but you would remain conscious (assuming your respiratory system isn't exposed) and generally be in control of what's going on. Eventually other complications would likely set in and need to be managed carefully. 

Recently I have been trying to get a good look at Jupiter through my 6" Orion reflector, but the image seems to always come out as an oblong white streak. I've tried changing the lenses I'm using, but that only changes the size of the oblong streak. I looked at the moon with the same lenses to see if it was a general problem with the reflector, but the image of the moon came out clear as usual. What sort of problems could be causing this? 

Making a major edit to this answer, as it would seem that there is a rather significant misunderstanding in the formula. Initially describing r as the radius may have been a mistake. While we may normally describe r as the radius of Earth when describing Earth, this is because we are describing the escape velocity of Earth from the surface, which means that the difference between our location and the center of gravity of the Earth is roughly equal to the radius of Earth. When determining escape velocity from an arbitrary distance, r should be the distance between the escaping body and the center of gravity of the body being escaped. For objects at a normal distance, changing the volume, and thus the density of the object, will not affect nearby objects, as the mass stays the same. However, this changes when you get close, when you compress the object this allows you to get closer to the center of gravity of the object. As you know, gravity is a weak force which deteriorates quickly with distance. As such, when you decrease the volume of the body, a body can then become closer to its center of gravity, increasing the potential maximum escape velocity. The body becomes a black hole when the physical volume of the body becomes small enough that the Schwarzschild Radius extends beyond it. Because we take the same mass, and decrease the volume, the result is a much denser area of spacetime, but this isn't generally the result of only a tiny volume, but also a large amount of mass. 

The nemesis theory proposes that a low mass star or brown dwarf in highly elliptical orbit is a companion to our sun as a solution to the cyclical mass extinction problem ($URL$ and ($URL$ Scientists noticed that some mass extinctions follow a seemingly cyclical pattern, so researchers proposed that the orbit of a small companion star (or a brown dwarf) was disturbing comets or asteroids as it approached aphelion and flinging them towards the earth. As interesting as this would be, WISE's infrared scans of the sky have revealed nothing and there is currently no evidence supporting the theory. Furthermore the orbit of any companion would have to be very large and would therefore be very unstable and would likely be detectable. The Astrobiologist David Morrison stated of the theory: "(T)he Sun is not part of a binary star system. There has never been any evidence to suggest a companion. The idea has been disproved by several infrared sky surveys, most recently the WISE mission. If there were a brown dwarf companion, these sensitive infrared telescopes would have detected it." 

One would not, under normal conditions, die within seconds. This is a common trope in science fiction, but there has been quite a bit of real research into the subject. Let's speak on each point. 

As you've said, the definition of binary star systems would mean that the cases you are describing would not be considered binary star systems. That said, there are other arrangements which exceed binary, but are often thought of as including binary relationships. This is due to star systems which reach beyond binary often resulting in hierarchical arrangements. For instance, many triple star systems involve what is largely a close binary star system with a third star that orbits the pair at a much greater distance. For an extreme example of this, consider Castor, which is a sextuple star system containing three binary star pairs. These systems wouldn't technically be said to be binary star systems, but rather to contain binary pairs, but given the question I can't think of a better way of having a binary star system that isn't a binary star system. Note that the hierarchical nature of super-binary systems is a matter of system evolution. Systems which would not be considered hierarchical are believed to be unstable, which would eventually result in the ejection of a star from the system. 

As awesome as space rain would be, the sun does not deposit any water molecules on earth. Solar wind consists of ionized particles propelled into space from the sun, and while some of these particles are hydrogen, and some are oxygen ($URL$ these are ionized particles therefore incapable of bonding with each other in the manner necessary to create water. Furthermore, even if these particles did lose enough kinetic energy to reach the energy level low enough to bond to one another, it is unlikely that they would be able to do so because their high velocity, coupled with the incredibly high chance of them missing the earth and the deflective prowess of the magnetosphere would preclude such processes. If somehow enough hydrogen and oxygen atoms were low energy enough and did arrive at the poles, I doubt that they would bond, because the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water requires activation energy. 

In this video there is blue diffused sunlight present in the atmosphere. At any point where you might expect blue light to be diffused from the Moon, there is also blue light diffused from the Sun being added back into what you see. To know for sure, you would need to have a recording from night. The density of air could also be a consideration. The perspective in the video shows the moon from above cloud clover passing below cloud cover. The further the light passes from the Earth's surface doesn't only result in less distance spent in the atmosphere, but also the density of air throughout the entire passage.
