One of the main questions I would have thought is about water distribution. The water has to be shallow enough that it doesn't cover the entire planet, but on a totally flat planet, how can this happen? Shouldn't it be entirely covered or entirely dry? The answer is in the spin of the planet. The centripetal force attracts the water to be deepest at the equator, meaning it could be deeper there than at the poles, in fact, all other things being equal, the poles are deserts and you'd have to have the habitable zone between the poles and the equator. Second are the tides. This all depends on satellites (e.g. the Moon) and the local star (the Sun). With these you could cause complete chaos with the water if you wanted, dragging it all over the planet, so that at some stage or another there is nowhere that's left untouched. If life on the planet is reasonably amphibious (or learned to float a long time ago) then tides could be used to fertilise the land. Then you have problem of the "water cycle". That is Ocean => Evapouration => Clouds => Rain => River => Ocean. Our rain usually happens when warm air evapourates some water, then comes in contact with cold air which condenses it again. The problem now is what happens with the fallen rain without hills and slopes to carry it away? I imagine a lot of stagnant pools in the slightly lower areas not currently occupied by oceans, just waiting to be evapourated again or to seep underground. Tidal & centripetal forces would not necessarily be able to drag it back with any great force, and probably not with a consistent enough direction for it to carve out rivers. In fact I think you'd need the planet to have a very precise amount of water - enough that some of it is above surface level and it doesn't all just seep into the ground, but not enough that it entirely covers the surface. 

Computers follow the rules as dictated in the programming. They "care" for us in the sense that they will do things that benefit us and and ensure we come to no harm because this is the job they are programmed to do. So imagine a computer capable of a certain range of actions, e.g. one that can cook and serve dinner. It will cook a dinner that will get the optimal combination of nutrition and taste using the available ingredients and equipment, while trying to maintain a variety from previous days, thanks to calculations, logical flows and various parameters in its programming too complex to go into here. It is therefore caring for us. But you are be asking does it really care whether we get a nutritious meal or is it just doing it because it's programmed to? It's like a chef in a health food restaurant whose job it is to cook a healthy and tasty meal but you want it to be more like a mother with an emotional need to ensure the health and happiness of her children. The answer is it doesn't have to. Humans and animals have emotions and are protective of children (especially their own children) because they don't have programming or strict rules forcing them and informing them exactly how to do everything to care for them. Instead, since they are created by nature, all they have is a relatively rough guide - i.e. emotions - to whether things are good or bad. Feeling bad about things going bad and good about things being good is what encourages you to do what you can to make things good. Having this instinctive drive to care for our children may be, as you say, natural (unlike a computer) but it's really just a replacement for the procedural behaviour of a computer which suits the non-procedural / dynamic (or woolly) thinking human / animal a lot more. To do as you say would be a lot of work for little benefit - you want to program the computer to do its job, but then add in a parameter that states how good the computer feels about itself, try to measure how well it thinks it did its job and tie this "good-feeling" parameter to that... But for what purpose? 

Another possibility if the time scale allows. Start to spread rumours that the area is haunted by evil ghosts, ghouls and goblins. The commoners will be afraid to go in, but the witches, who actually know about real magic will know the rumours are all a load of rubbish ("that's not how magic works! Those idiot commoners!") and go into the area anyway. 

Years of television pictures and reports of weeping parents and children and friends of dead soldiers have made it unpalatable to ask or force natural born people to fight in wars. Every time the subject of the military or fighting is brought up, there is huge political pressure against it from the families of people who have lost, or are worried about losing loved ones to battle. There is no one to cry for the clones though. Previously difficult decisions are easier when it's "Someone Else's Problem" for everyone. Yes everyone agrees it's a terrible, unethical thing they're doing, and there are probably protests against it organised by people regarded as hippies, lefties and unemployed intellectuals with too much time on their hands, and they have the right to be heard. But there is no outrage, no inferno of emotion. Scenes of parents shouting at, abusing and attacking recruiters while refusing to allow their sons & daughters to be taken away do not occur. No local representatives / councillors / members of parliament who have heard the real life stories and are willing to stand up in the government, not for the clones. 

All great answers, and I would just like to add that just because there is a possibility that dwarves might find themselves in a battle where having cavalry would be an advantage, doesn't mean they would use them. By then, they would not have a tradition of using cavalry. Unlike (say) humans, they wouldn't have a large pool of decent horses to draw from, built up from years of breeding and conditioning by a long-running culture of experienced horse... carers/breeders(?). Neither would they have a tradition of riders who have inspired young soldiers to be the best horsemen they could be. For example, you'd probably never see a joust at a dwarven fair. All of these would mean that if they did field a unit of cavalry, it would be one of inexperienced troops on poor to mediocre horses... So what would be the point? 

There is a bit of a paradox here. Let's say the precogs see something that is normally avoidable with foreknowledge. e.g. They see you will die in a car-crash on the 15th of July 2016. So all you have to do is stay away from cars on the 15th. A movie will often try to get around this with some story-telling trick, like either the prediction was misinterpreted and a mistake was made - e.g. you were hit at midnight on the night of the 14th which is technically the 15th but you thought of as the 14th, or the prediction was incomplete - e.g. a freak accident and a car went flying off the road, through your sitting room window and killed you on the couch - leaving the viewer wondering why the prediction didn't include the bizarre incident of a car crashing into a house. Reality would be different. Logically, a prediction can only occur of something that will happen, because if you avoid the prediction, then it wasn't a prediction, it was a guess - how did they foresee the thing if it doesn't end up happening? We can't assume that there is some unknown agent trying to enforce the prediction of the precogs by any means necessary no matter what's done to avoid it. The result? The precogs can only see what will definitely happen even with fore-knowledge, whether that be unavoidable things like Earthquakes & Weather, or just things that someone wouldn't bother avoiding even if they know it's going to happen (e.g. you will go to work tomorrow). This is still useful though. They will predict an Earthquake, for example, but they won't see how many people are going to die in it, so the area can be evacuated in time. But it couldn't be used to predict crime. 

Maybe your futuristic city has a futuristic rubbish collection system that, instead of having trucks come around and empty the bins, rubbish is "flushed away" and transported to the dump through underground tunnels and channels just like sewerage. For convenience of building and maintenance, sewerage and rubbish channels run together (like telegraph poles with roads or railways in modern times). Therefore your scavengers have a good reason to hang out in the sewers. 

Assuming the authorities can't use magic themselves... They could have a nobleman buy (or pretend to buy) all the land that contains the perimeter - spread it over a much wider area to prevent suspicion. Designate this area as private property, and make it clear and well known that no unauthorised people are allowed to enter. Try and have the land contain as little valuable land as possible, so as not to give anyone any other reason to go in (you don't want angry farmers crossing the perimeter because they wanted their cows to graze there) Now don't make it particularly heavily guarded - just enough so that people without good reason will keep away (strongly worded signs, maybe just a few watchmen), but the witches who are desperate to get to this unicorn zone (and maybe a few poachers) will try to get in anyway. 

Just reading up on what an Alcubierre drive is, and it seems to work by shrinking space in front of an object to allow the object to travel through the space faster than light. Could you use the same principle for sending data? i.e. instead of a "warp bubble", have a warp tunnel? An almost infinitely thin (to minimise the size of it and therefore the energy required) line of shrunken space between the transmitter and the receiver through which data can be sent. 

Infinite Worlds If there are an infinite number of worlds, and more than one of them have speaking inhabitants (therefore an infinite number of them do), it means there are an infinite number of permutations of word-sounds. This means that there is a world (more than one, in fact) out there where the inhabitants just happen to use the same word sounds as that of our hero, and therefore the speak the exact same language. Now all you have to handwave is the ridiculously amazing coincidence of our hero landing on this world as opposed to one of the zillions of others. But it could simply be that whatever god, machine, mechanism sent him there did it deliberately for this reason. 

Going to space is extremely difficult. Even to say the human race has been to space is pushing the truth a bit considering how very few of us have actually been there. The chances of any of us who would like to go there getting there is minuscule. (So in a way we're all prevented from going to space) To answer your question, look at why "we" went to space and take away that factor. It wasn't simply the next logical progression from firearms, you don't just point your gun at the sky and expect to launch a bullet into orbit. For the human race, there was huge political pressure to do it, between the end of World War 2, where German rocket technology in some form was discovered by both the Soviet Union and the United States, allies in the war who were afraid of each other. Even then, there was no reason for space travel - it was a ridiculously costly endeavour for no return. But the heads of rocket research on both sides happened to push for it and managed to convince their respective governments that if they didn't, the other would and be able to drop missiles from orbit onto their respective countries. So take away World War 2 or the German research or the Cold War or even the fact that both Superpowers managed to get access to the technology, and no space travel. 

For the one that encompasses the surface and atmosphere, you don't mention whether the anti-gravity goes with the atmosphere as it leaves Earth, but let's assume it doesn't. The first thing that's going to happen is that anything not stuck to the ground will get flung into space by centripetal force. However, as soon as it hits a 100km altitude (the traditional "beginning" of space and outer limit of the atmosphere), it's going to be captured by gravity again, albeit slightly less of it. This means that all the survivors will live at 100 km on a sort of invisible bubble - almost as if they were in a low orbit (though not the same thing). They'll have to be able learn to swim, though, as all the water will go with them, and form a giant floating ocean around the earth. Things will tend towards the equator but this movement will be limited by the masses of water. Saltwater and fresh water will mix so there'll be nothing to drink up there, and I imagine food production will be impossible too. For people who stayed indoors, and are still on Earth's ceilings, their water is now all gone except what was left in their attic tanks, and they will most probably not be able to breathe because if there's any air left it's only courtesy of the pressure of the air from 100 km above them, which is likely to be tiny (since most of the atmosphere is above the new ocean, and anyway, the Earth's spin is trying to push it away) Besides it's going to get very cold because of the shield of water blocking the sun. 

You say late medieval but then also reference not using metals - metals were well in use by the late medieval time... So I'll assume you mean stone-age. (or at least pre Bronze age?) First of all, the robots have been built by an advanced but unknown (and possibly even extinct by the time of the story) society who have no interaction with this society. Many of the robots have a sort of smaller, secondary / auxiliary or even third or fourth life which becomes activated once their main body has been destroyed. Sort of like the Terminator in Terminator 2. Or perhaps they have an auto-repair function. This has given rise to the (possibly religious) belief that robots are haunted and even after they are defeated they may spring back to life at any moment. This explains why, once they have defeated a robot, the people don't try and scavenge the scrap metal. (They want to get rid of it ASAP, so they probably throw it in the sea or something) However, they also have no knowledge of the idea of extracting metal ore from the ground and smelting/putting through whatever processes are required to create usable metal. Whoever built the robots have long since stripped the easily accessible ore from the ground and it doesn't occur to our stone-age people that one could tunnel deep into the ground to mine for more. Edit If you really do mean late medieval and they have metals, but why don't they advance further, it could be a similar answer, but a defeated robot could not really reveal much information: It doesn't use easily visible "slightly" advanced technologies like steam or gunpowder or clockwork components. It uses electronics, advanced electromagnetic servos and quantum picoprocessors. The rare engineer of the time who was brave to get close wouldn't be able to make head nor tail of what was going on with all these long metal strings and black boxes so it wouldn't offer any use in advancing their own technology.
