I agree with your statement that "he openly admits that he's going along with Directive 10-289 because he's a racketeer". In discussions with the looters, Kinnan is aloof and jaded, and seems to despise them. He plays along with them as long as they'll keep his racket going. He knows they know it's a racket, but they're terribly afraid of unions because of their collective power and because it would be politically unpopular to cut them off or throw them under the bus. Kinnan is a crook, an exploiter, and a realist. But he is not a killer like Floyd Ferris or James Taggart. Consider the following from each: Floyd Ferris: 

Also, like honor among thieves, it seems that Kinnan cares about the truth. He has no interest in lying to himself or others, and refuses to be drawn in when the looters start propagandizing each other and trying hard to believe it. In short, he won't tolerate BS and occasionally puts a stop to it when he hears it. In summary: Kinnan accepts none of the looters' philosophy because he knows it's all BS. But he embraces the power structure the looters have set up because he gets power and money from it, and he is unashamed to game the system to his benefit. 

John Galt was a genius. He invented "the motor" and executed the greatest strike in world history. And it's clear that he understood the danger he was always in (out in the world) and how the looters operate. So it has always been puzzling to me why, at the end of Atlas Shrugged, Galt thought it was a good idea to go back to the world so quickly after the final crash and bring all the strikers with him. Granted, the lights had gone out in NYC, the Taggart bridge had collapsed, and the nation was near starvation. But the political leaders such as Mr. Thompson and all his cronies were still--at least to some degree--in power. If the strikers had come back and started fixing everything, why would anyone believe that Thompson's gang wouldn't have immediately started exploiting them, regulating them, taxing them to death, and controlling them? I would have thought that the strikers needed to wait long enough for the current government leaders to be swept from power and run out of town, clearing the way for the strikers' return. Rand makes it clear that the strikers cared little for political power, so we cannot assume that upon their return they would have tried to step into the shoes of political power in order to achieve their goals. They simply would have gone back to work, and once again been exploited by the looting politicians. Admittedly, we don't know how much time passed between the rescue flight back from the State Science Institute and the moon-lit walk in the valley in which Galt declares to Dagney that "we're going back", but it certainly seems as though very little time had elapsed. Weeks? Days? 

Somewhere or other, many years ago, I read that there was a name for the type of book written by the likes of L.M. Alcott. That they were a backlash against the novels of the time and meant to teach moral lessons. Is this true, and is there a name for the genre? 

I read this poem in a collection and now I can't find it. It starts with the poet talking about how they were approached by someone who had loved one of their poems. But the reader could not remember the name of the poem. This delighted the poet because, not only had the poem moved the reader, but someday they would rediscover it and be moved all over again as if they were reading it for the first time. Does anybody know the name of this poem, and the name of the poet? (P.S. Yes, I am aware of the irony here) 

I read the synopsis of this book a number of years and have since been unable to remember the title or author. Searching of likely options have been unsuccessful. I remember the following details: 

I've been trying to figure this out recently, but I can't. My logic it this: 1) A lot of people think that poetry must rhyme. But the list of poets who broke with that tradition when it suited them is too long to write here. So... 2) Perhaps it is the length. Poems tend, these days, to be shorter than prose writing. But the very earliest known poem was The Epic of Gilgamesh. Which is very long and tells a story. These Epic poems were quite common in the old oral tradition. So perhaps it is the existence of rhythm. Such as the famous use of Iambic pentameter by Shakespeare (although he did screw with that when it suited his purposes). But... 3) Then you get free verse, which follows the rhythm of human speech. Rather than any sort of strict meter. So if none of this is a defining characteristic of all poetry in the modern incarnation: How can one define poetry? 

I am quite far removed from my studies of early American History, so I am sure there are many nuances to the politics that I am forgetting, but one of the major reasons that Washington was considered a good candidate for president was his prior experience leading the Continental Army (see here). Because this experience was so important to his contemporaries, it makes sense that they would continue to use his military rank when referring to him. And as a previous answer explained, it is clear that in Melville's time, the use of General Washington is more common than President Washington. However, all this aside, if we try to understand why Melville chooses this for Moby Dick, I think there may be some value in thinking about the different connotations behind someone who leads as a general vs a president. A general is the ultimate decision-maker. Although s/he might (should) consider input from others in the military, in some ways the military really is a dictatorship; if a general gives an order, his troops are to carry it out, no questions asked. Conversely, a President is a politician, and is Constitutionally designed to be the opposite of a dictator, instead listening to input coming from a variety of constituents before making a final decision. It could be that Melville's choice of the word General instead of President was a deliberate indication that dictators are the only type of leaders respected within Ahab's world. 

I have never read any of the 50 Shades books, and this answer is solely based on the many times I have read reviews and commentaries that denigrate the writing quality. So take that into consideration when reading this answer. As I understand it, the series was written as a piece of fan fic originally. There really are no prerequisites for an author of fan fic beyond having an idea, and taking the time and energy to write it out. So, it is completely possible that the author of the 50 Shades series does not have any formal training in how to construct a narrative. By no means am I suggesting that authors of fan fic don't know how to write, just that they may be less likely to have been educated about structural issues that create effective narrative. And i don't know anything specific about the background of the author, who may or may not have any formal training in writing fiction. But I bring this up because it may be that you are looking to analyze elements within the novel that simply aren't there. There may be no pinch point, because she didn't know that creating one would be useful to drive a plot. As I understand it, the appeal of these books is the sexual relationship/content between he two main characters, and it is very possible that they were able to appeal to a great number of readers on the basis of that content alone, even without the formal elements that usually form the framework of a successful story. It's very like the cliche of a pizza delivery guy coming to the door in a porn movie and then being drawn in to have sex with his customers. That has got to be one of the silliest plot elements ever, but most people don't watch porn movies because they have good plots. TL;DR-- you may not be able to identify all of these structural elements in this novel, because the author, untrained in formal writing practice, may not have included them in the first place.
