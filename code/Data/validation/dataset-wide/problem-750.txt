The arrows indicate the direction on of the stress under load. Then as the link and pin wear, there must appear a gap opposite to the where the load presses the parts together: 

Some derailleurs, particularly "old style" drop-out-mounted ones have a pivot whose upper end is a kind of combination joint: it has a bushing that allows the pivot to rotate, under spring action, and that joint also has attachments for the pivot's parallelogram members. Newer style direct-mount derailleurs (but even new drop-out-mount ones like the Shimano RD-TX55) elongate this upper joint of the pivot into a small member. The rotating bushing is on the upper end of this member (rotating around the mounting bolt on the DM units), and the parallelogram members attach at the lower end of this member. Does this member have a special name? Is it considered part of the pivot, or are only the parallelogram arms "the pivot"? For that matter, does the original "combination joint" have a name, and is it considered separate from the pivot? 

As far as the numbers on the box go, you can be slightly out of the tube's range. There is no such thing as a 23 mm tube. There are tubes which include 23 mm in their range. Your existing tubes in your 25 mm tires could already extend over the 23 mm range. Suppose your existing tubes are "22-25". Then, the 23 mm tires are in the middle of that range. Or suppose your tubes are 25-28. Then the 23 mm size is a bit out of range: it's okay to re-use the tubes if they pass the above avoid guidelines. 

Stay away from gasoline for now. Many bicycle parts contain some internal grease/lubricant, and gasoline can get inside and dissolve the grease, so that they are no longer lubricated and protected against rust. You see advice on the internet to use gasoline, alcohol, WD40 or other stuff. People have different opinions about that, so I don't want to dismiss it, but you should know what you're doing and which parts can be damaged. For beginners, best stick to water, then dry and put some lubricant on the chain and other moving parts. 

Do not use a bright helmet light on paths with oncoming other cyclists or pedestrians, as you will easily dazzle them. As we naturally tend to look at other peoples' faces, you will very often shine your light right into their eyes. This can actually be more dangerous (I once almost collided with a cyclist who blinded me so that I lost control). On the other hand, a helmet light is useful when you are on a lonely dark path because you may want to look to the side when you e.g. hear something. So please switch a helmet light off or reduce the brightness when there is a chance you can blind others. On a road with motor traffic, the main issue is to be seen (not so much the light helps you see). I would have at least one light fixed on the bike, as the moving light on the helmet can make it difficult for drivers to judge your speed, directions and intentions. 

Shimano HG-XX cassettes are definitely not discontinued; just the numbers have changed. HG-30 became HG-40, and now HG-50. You can find an 8 speed HG50 cassette in the gearing ranges from 11-28T to 11-34T ("Mega Range"). You can also replace with a non-Shimano cassette, which is compatible with the HUB. For instance SRAM PG-850 and others. The cheap KMC 6-8 speed chains are everywhere. Maybe not exactly the "Z7", but some other number like "Z51". 

The main problem is that the gear ratios of a transmission multiply or divide torque. A 100:1 transmission means that the torque you are generating is being divided by 100. If the resulting torque is less than what is needed to move the bike, then you won't be able to turn the pedals. If you are on a smooth, level road, with well inflated tires, and no headwind, then the torque required to begin moving is close to zero, and so having your torque cut by 100 might not be an impediment against beginning to move. However, as soon as you start moving, impedance builds due to air drag and rolling resistance. As soon as this impedance adds up to your torque / 100, you cannot go any faster. High gears allow our muscles to work slowly, similar to doing a slow bench press. You probably know from weight lifting that your maximum force is developed during a slow lift. If you can press a 200 pound bar off your chest quickly, that means you can handle quite a bit more weight. Using a high gear is somewhat like doing a slow lift; you're developing a greater force. High gears also allow us to reduce wasteful motion of the legs, improving our efficiency. However, the gear must not be so high that the output torque is less than the force that is required to maintain the desired speed (a force opposite and equal to the total drag). The increase in gear ratio allows you to develop more torque against the pedal crank, but at the same time, the output torque diminishes. The output torque must not diminish to the point that you cannot maintain speed. So there is a trade-off happening which means there is some optimal point. This point depends on you, of course: your body geometry, strength and weight, and on the conditions: slope, wind, surface, bicycle (tires, etc). Also, the intended riding distance! You might be able to sprint a mile in a high gear that would be inappropriate for you to use for a 100 mile road trip. You probably know from experience that a gear that feels ideal on level ground may be overpowered as soon as you encounter an incline: you make an extra effort, yet the bike slows down. This is because the output torque is too low to push the bicycle up the hill. Switching to a lower gear allows you to then maintain a speed that would be impossible in the high gear. 

Do you live in a region with efficient and non-corrupt police? Then it might be useful to get advice from them, and report the incidents to them. The police can sometimes act even if there has not been an actual collision. From your description, it seems that you think that driver behaviour is the problem, not your own skills. You should of course check if you can do anything yourself to be safer (the other replies give advice on that), but driver behaviour is definitely often an issue. Dangerous behaviour can be due to several factors, and without knowing the specifics of each incident it is not really possible to judge. It could be anything from inexperience, honest mistakes, misjudging a complicated situation, inattention, not knowing how much space cyclists need, all the way to people who have a grudge against cyclists for whatever reason and deliberately try to "teach you a lesson", for example a "punishment pass" that doesn't quite hit you but scares you to death. When you feel threatened or in danger, then you should contact to the police. If they are competent, they will be able to judge if drivers threaten you deliberately, but in most countries there are also laws that cover dangerous or careless driving. It might be difficult to have enough evidence, but often the police can at least speak to the driver or even issue a warning, which may already help to make them aware and change their behaviour. If it happens frequently, then you should think about getting a camera to collect evidence. But note that recording others is not legal in all countries. You should definitely be careful before you upload clips on the internet - besides being possibly illegal, it can also reduce the chances of getting a conviction, because a widely shared youtube video can mean (in some jurisdictions) that the accused can't get a fair trial, so the case will not even be tried. Therefore, do show the video to the police first, get advice if they can do anything, but don't put it on youtube. Besides driver behaviour, there are also cases where the road design leads to conflict, e.g. cycle lanes dumping you into fast traffic where drivers don't expect you, or bad sightlines at junctions. Again, it is helpful to report such incidents, as many police forces need this information to know about "hotspots" to focus their work on. 

Because of the tilt of the seat tube, this setup does not make for efficient pedaling. The seat is sitting over the center of the rear wheel, which moves your entire center of gravity too far to the back. You want the center of gravity to be a bit ahead of the bottom bracket, where the downward force is applied to the pedals. That's one of the two main reasons for the aggressive position: that forward center of gravity. The other reason is aerodynamics, of course. I suggest creating a zig-zagged seat tube: 

Another way is to use some kind of shim between one of the pads and the rim when squeezing the brake. Clamp the cable and remove the shim. *V-brakes are strong when you have correctly positioned pads in good condition, with about 1/8" clearance from the rim of a wheel that is clean and true, everything is tight, and the cable and brake lever hardware are in good condition. * If your wheel has significant runout, you can still have decent braking power, because the V-brake arms will move from side to side to track the runout. However, the brake pads may rub on the wheel when you are not using the brake, which robs you of energy and wears the pads. Learn how to true a wheel, or have it done. (If you have it done, you might as well have the shop tune up your brakes for a package deal tune up price.) 

You are going at constant speed when the driving force from gravity Fg is equal to the drag (air resistance) Fd plus friction (rolling resistance) Ff: Fg = Fd + Ff When coasting down a hill, the driving force is the component of the gravitational force parallel to the road: Fg = m g sin(a) Here, a is the slope (angle with the horizontal), m is the mass of bike and rider, and g is the gravitational constant. Slopes on roads are often measured in percent, and for small angles sin(a) is equal to the slope in percent. e.g. for a slope of 10% (100m descent on 1km of road) sin(a) = 0.1. Drag is proportional to the square of the velocity v, the projected frontal area A and a drag coefficient cd, and the density of air rho: Fd = 1/2 rho v^2 cd A The drag coefficient cd depends on the shape of the object - streamlined bodies have a low cd, but for a bicycle with rider I find approximately cd = 1 in Wikipedia. I'd estimate the frontal area of a cyclist to about 0.4m^2. Friction (rolling resistance) is proportional to a coefficient cr and the normal force (the weight component perpendicular to the road) Fn = m g cos(a): Ff = cr m g cos(a) The coefficient of rolling resistance cr will depend on the bike (lubrication, tire pressure, surface roughness etc.). For car tires on concrete, Wikipedia gives cr=0.01, so the Ff would be about 10N. That's about a tenth of the driving force on a 10% slope (see above), but on a rough road surface it might well be much more. So we end up with m g sin(a) = Fg = Fd + Ff = 1/2 rho v^2 cd A + cr m g cos(a) Solving this for v gives: v^2 = 2 m g (sin(a) - cr cos(a) ) / (rho cd A) Putting in g=10m/s^2, rho=1.2kg/m^3, cd=1, A=0.4m^2, and m=100kg (nice round number for rider and bike), I get v = sqrt( sin(a)-cr cos(a) ) * 64 m/s The rolling resistance cr essentially is like reducing the slope somewhat, so a slope of 10%=0.1 with cr=0.01 is the same as a slope of 9% on a perfectly rolling bike. So, for a slope of 10%, the sqrt becomes 0.3, and I get a speed of 19m/s = 70km/h It's not unrealistic, but perhaps a bit faster than I would have expected. However, there are simplified assumptions, friction and rolling resistance is probably higher and cd and A have a big effect, they all depend on the bike and the rider. From the drag equation you can see why the racing position is with the head down. This position decreases the frontal area A considerable, compared to an upright position, and it makes the body somewhat more streamlined (reduces cd). As the drag goes with the square of the velocity, this gets more important at higher speed. 

150 miles isn't all that far, but if I had five people, I'd bring a chain whip, spanner and cassette removal tool, some spoke wrenches (in the right sizes for everyone's spoke nipples) and spokes in various sizes (again, matching the mixture of bikes). If someone who has rim brakes pops a spoke, the rest of the trip won't be as much fun for them. Spokes tend to break on the cassette side of the rear hub, requiring cassette removal to insert the new one. Also a chain pin press for opening/closing. The extra quick links are of little use by themselves; you're unlikely to lose the ones that are on your chain now for a straight replacement. If a chain breaks or a link gets bent, you will likely need the chain tool to remove a bad link before you can put it together with the quick links. There is probably no need to get carried away: keep the bottom bracket removal tools and such at home. You probably won't be rebuilding suspension forks, or taking apart derailleurs and such. Speaking of getting dirty: bring a decent quantity of the pumice-type mechanic's hand cleaner. You fixed that broken chain and spoke, and want to get on your way, but your hands are filthy, leaving black grime on everything you touch. Related to this: consider bringing a pair of work gloves. 

I'm not sure weight is the main issue. There are several questions on this site from people weighing more than you, and the general advice seems to be that it should be fine. Sure, more weight puts bike under more stress, but bikes are generally fairly sturdy. But make sure that there are no missing spokes, and check regularly if there are cracks in the rim or the wheel buckles; if so, perhaps replace it with a sturdier mountain bike wheel. I don't quite understand your liner and that might well be the main issue. I would just get a good, puncture-proof tire, and a new tube, and not use anything else. My experience: I used a proper kevlar tire liner for a while, but had many punctures too. It is very difficult to align the liner properly inside the tire, and it can move and pinch the tire. After several punctures I just took it out, got good new tires, and that's it. I don't understand the way you make your own liner out of old tires, but this is really difficult to do properly and you may well create sharp edges or pinch points that damage the tube. With a good tyre, you don't need another liner between tire and tube at all. It seems that you already checked for damages in the rim or spokes that stick out, and make sure the rim tape (the plastic that goes around the rim over the spoke nipples) is in good condition. Keep the tire well inflated near the maximum (the number is printed on the sidewall). If it's underinflated, the tube can move or get pinched when you go over a kerb for example, and that will also lead to damage. Finally, observe carefully where and how you ride. Perhaps there are locations where you go over a kerb or road damage, and if you take that too fast, it can damage your wheels. 

You don't need to eat anything over 3 to 4 hours of cycling. It's possible not to eat for 4 hours while being active, even intensely active, and be all right. People complete marathons in this timeframe, without taking in anything other than liquids. 

Changing a bottom bracket cartridge is very easy. I would say that it's easier and less fiddly than, say, attaching a derailleur (including the cabling, and fine tuning it). You need some strength, but not as much as for the removal of a stubborn cassette lock-ring, or thread-on freewheel. You need two specialized tools. Since the cranks have to come off, you need a "crank puller" (actually a pin press) which is a bit that attaches into a threaded receptacle in a pedal crank, and is used to create the pressure against the spindle to detach the crank. You also need a bottom bracket tool to loosen the old bottom bracket cartridge and install the new one. In addition to that you need the right wrench to remove the crank bolts first (removing these bolts is not sufficient to get the cranks off, hence the need for the crank puller to pry the cranks off). You also need a big wrench to turn the bottom bracket tool and crank puller. Some variants of these tools come with integrated wrenches.
