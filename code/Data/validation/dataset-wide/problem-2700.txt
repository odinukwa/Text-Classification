"Proper" meaning "that which supports the life of a rational being" or "that which promotes the life of a rational being" etc... 

The principle an Objectivist would emphasize for you is private property (and more fundamentally self-ownership). An Objectivist would argue that there are perfectly ethical occasions where force is the only rational course of action, such as in defending against attackers. So, the characterization of the Objectivist position you've put forward isn't quite accurate. If property is damaged then the victim has every right to prosecute and seek compensation. So, the Objectivist wouldn’t be morally concerned so much with damage to “the environment.” Objectivism holds that the earth is a resource that must be exploited in order for human life to flourish. It could (and has been) argued that consumption of resources “degrades the general quality” of the environment, and this overreach has been Objectivism’s main disagreement with the environmental movements. What the Objectivist would be concerned with morally is damage to property. If perhaps someone set fire to a patch of land that was owned and operated by a private individual or company, such as a park, then damages would be provable and they would seek prosecution of the arsonist in the pursuit of just compensation for that particular case. “Environmental degradation”, the Objectivist would argue, is a fact of sustaining human life… unless your property rights are violated you have no recourse to action because no injustice has been done. It would be morally irrelevant if you merely have strong feelings against other people burning fossil fuels, or cutting down trees on their own land, or performing controlled burns, etc... Also, I would be slower to assert the "obvious" when it comes to how individual actions impact the "general population." The cost benefit calculation is a complex problem, and there is a lot of politically motivated junk science that one could source to agree with just about any position. Take for example fossil fuels and climate change. The "consensus" is that burning fossil fuels "generally degrades the quality of the environment" and you would argue therefor harms the "general population." Great catastrophes await us! The end is nigh! Take for example one counter argument put forth by Alex Epstein in his book "The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels." In this book he points out that even though our population has boomed tremendously over the last 200 years globally, the number of climate related deaths is significantly down. Since everything requires energy, our ability to harness this energy to prolong our lives and raise our quality of life clashes with the doomsday prophecies of apocalyptic climate catastrophes. The argument contradicts the idea that fossil fuels harm the "general population" by pointing out all the ways in which they significantly improve and prolong human life. Lastly, as a note about my own personal position on this. I'm both a conservationist and strongly sympathic toward Objectivism and Austrian economics. I fall in roughly the same camp as Patrick Moore, one of the founding members of Greenpeace, in that I think "sustainable development" is the most reasonable solution, but not one to be forced on others. He did a podcast late 2015 with Columbia PhD Historian Tom Woods where he explained his falling out with Greenpeace and the current environmental movement, and spoke at length about sustainable development. This doesn't add anything to the ethical question of self-ownership, but does illustrate how the two sides of the argument are not necessarily polar opposites... and how a harmonious and justifiable position can be found between both. 

If everything has a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be anything without a cause, it may just be the universe as God. You can not give a imaginary definition of attributes of God or a flying pink unicorn, as timeless or out space being or uncaused being, as proof of existence. Some have argued that because the universe is like a clock, there must be a clock maker. This is a slippery argument, because there is nothing that is really perfectly analogous to the universe as a whole, if your question is about the whole, because everything is just a part of universe. The question of the creation of the universe, the whole, itself makes no sense. Time didn't exist before the universe, so there is no time for a cause to make the universe in. The concept of "before" becomes meaningless when considering a situation without time. It’s like asking directions to the edge of the earth; The earth is a sphere; it doesn't have an edge; so looking for it is a futile exercise. Why is there something, the universe or God, rather than nothing? This is an illogical question because impose an impossible explanatory demand, to deduce the existence of something without using any existential premises. Of all the approaches to God’s existence, the deduction is the strategy that we would expect to be successful were there a necessary God. But there are not a valid deduction, then we can conclude that there is no such necessary God. 

To answer your question, "How fatal" I would answer "Not at all." If human beings are understood as living organisms with specific requirements for survival (obvious), and that a code of values (morality) is a requirement and necessarily must be based on the ultimate value of ones own life (including achieving happiness throughout that life)... then the very concepts of what ought a person do can be easily answered and defended based on individual codes of value, within the context of the ultimate value of ones own life. Lets better understand another piece of this quote now. My emphasis in bold, and commentary in ellipses. 

I'm not really sure what more there is to explain other than to point out that it has nothing to do with the shallow immediate economic gain for the masses and everything to do with the principle of self-ownership. Any shallow immediate economic gain can't have any substance if "you" are nothing but a piece of property owned by the state. 

If we have to choose only one word to represent the view of analytic philosophers to continental philosophy I think is "unintelligible" or "obscure". One frequent criticism of analytic philosophy is that it is a highly technical mode of thought, restricting itself to criticism of minute details of language, and has abandoned the great narrative of a worldview. A perennial criticism of analytic philosophy is that it fails to engage with our deepest and most basic human concerns, and has thereby rendered itself irrelevant to the larger culture. 

Why Karl Popper wanted to say that the criteria of falsifiability is better than induction? Popper wanted to say that induction is not justifiable. That a theory has been corroborated in the past "says nothing whatever about future performance." Popper wanted to say that it is possible to avoid assuming that the future will, or probably will, be like the past, and this is why he has claimed to have solved the problem of induction. We do not have to make the assumption, he tells us, if we proceed by formulating conjectures and attempting to falsify them. He says that, as a basis for action, we should prefer "the best-tested theory." This can only mean the theory that has survived refutation in the past; but why, since Popper says that past corroboration has nothing to do with future performance, is it rational to prefer this? Without the inductive assumption, the fact that a theory was refuted yesterday is quite irrelevant to its truth-status today. So demising the inductive assumption makes nonsense of Popper's own theory of the growth of scientific knowledge. The more often a conjecture passes efforts to falsify it, Popper maintained, the greater becomes its "corroboration", although corroboration is also uncertain and can never be quantified by degree of probability. "Corroboration" is a form of induction, and Popper has simply sneaked induction in through a back door by giving it a new name. Every falsification of a conjecture is simultaneously a confirmation of an opposite conjecture, and every conforming instance of a conjecture is a falsification of an opposite conjecture. If Popper bet on a certain horse to win a race, and the horse won, you would not expect him to shout, "Great! My horse failed to lose!" Astronomers look for signs of water on Mars. They do not think they are making efforts to falsify the conjecture that Mars never had water. For Popper, what Carnap called a "degree of confirmation", a logical relation between a conjecture and all relevant evidence, is a useless concept. Instead, the more tests for falsification a theory passes, the more it gains in "corroboration”. It's not so much that Popper disagreed with inductivists as that he restated their views in a bizarre and cumbersome terminology. Why scratch your left ear with your right hand? 

The term "Randian" is very much a slur in comparison to the term "Objectivist." Think of it like referring to the "Tea Party" people (or really anyone from the right) as "Teabaggers." The perception is that Ayn Rand had the type of personality that did not accept disagreement among the people she associated herself with, and this was true to an extent. One application of the term "Randian" is essentially viewed as students of Objectivism who follow a person, as opposed to ascribing to a philosophy. Some people did (and do) treat Ayn Rand as if she's one of the romanticized perfect characters in her books. The term "cult" is thrown around a lot, and maybe its applicable to some groups of Objectivists. There are a lot of different types of Objectivists you can meet. One particular strain most associated as a "Randian" are the hyper-judgmental, very insecure, socially awkward types. This is obviously a stereotype but some of them do exist in the same severity as the Westboro crowd. The difference between the two isn't in philosophy. In fact I don't think there have been any major schisms on thought. It's not like when the Protestants split off from the Catholics. This is an unofficial label applied subjectively for a number of reasons (ignorance possibly being one of them) to Objectivists. Where most schisms occur is when one Objectivist comes to believe that the actions of another Objectivist are inconsistent with the principles of Objectivism. 

Rejection of free will isn't useless, determinism isn't nihilism, and we all need justification. Free will is a illusion. 

The challenge is to explain what is meant by a "inalienable natural right". Suppose we try to define inalienable natural rights for example in terms a God's revelation, or in terms of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. Then the fact that it will nevertheless make perfect sense to describe a something inalienable natural right but against or outside a God's will or the Declaration, will immediately show that the definition of inalienable natural right in terms of a God's revelation or The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has failed. Several major, predominantly Muslim countries criticized the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provisions for democratic principles, protection for religious freedom, freedom of association and freedom of the press, as well as equality in rights and equal protection under the law. Rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are to be subject to the Islamic sharia. On Asian values of Asian states perspective, the Bangkok Declaration of 1993 offers an extended critique of human rights universalism. They view the principles of sovereignty and noninterference, calling for greater emphasis on economic, social, and cultural rights, particularly the right to economic development, as inalienable natural rights too, over civil and political rights. War Resisters International has stated that the right to conscientious objection to military service, and the right to refuse to kill, are inalienable natural rights too. God’s counsel to parents: whenever children get out of line, we should beat them with a rod (Proverbs 13:24, 20:30, and 23:13-14). If they are shameless enough to talk back to us, we should kill them (Leviticus 20:9, Deuteronomy 21:18-21, Mark 7:9-13, and Matthew 15:4-7). The Bible even tells us we are free to sell our daughters into slavery (Exodus 21:26-27). If a man discovers on his wedding night that his bride is not a virgin, he must stone her to death on her father’s doorstep (Deuteronomy 22:13-21). Over time we read the Bible selectively and often metaphorically. But that is just the point: we must be consulting our standards of morality that do not come from God in order to judge which aspects of God's word to take literally and which aspects to ignore. Before we worship a God or Jesus we must judge him good, so our inalienable natural rights are not derived and are independent from a God or Jesus. A derivation from descriptive statements with “is” to prescriptive statements with “ought” is impossible. Without an objective, "inalienable natural goal", a "inalienable natural right" is difficult to establish. Without an objective "self-evident" truth is possible to think the opposite without a contradiction. Persuading someone would necessarily mean appealing to values he already possesses.

There are three key concepts involved in Objectivism when tackling the is-ought problem. They are "Man" (referring to mankind, but in terms of the individual person), "Value", and "Morality." Understanding these concepts, in addition to every concept upon which they depend as Objectivists define them, will help you understand how Objectivism dispenses with the is-ought. Objectivism maintains that concept formation is heirarchical, so these three concepts depend upon a great deal of more fundamental foundational concepts. Defining what every concept that these key concepts depends upon would require hundreds of pages to type out so I'll have to refer you to Leonard Peikoff's work "Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand." Specifically look at the first five chapters which cover Reality, Sense Perception, Volition, Concept Formation, Objectivity, and Reason. Chapters 6-9 really would be required reading as well because these lay the foundation for understanding Man, The Good, Virtue, and Happiness. It's not a very good answer to simply reply "read this book" but because the scope is so broad in this question I've limited the response for the sake of brevity (believe it or not) to the essential interplay between these key concepts at the highest level of abstraction. The important thing to understand is that it is quite impossible to grasp these concepts fully without the prerequisite framework in place upon which Objectivism depends (see Dr. Peikoff's book). Pertaining to the discussion in the comments section of the main question, this is also why Sam Harris falls short of presenting a fully validated framework for an objective ethical system. The concept of morality Rand describes, 

Before we worship a God or Jesus we must judge him good, so our moral is not derived and is independent from a God or Jesus. 

I am not sure what you want to mean. But I invite to think at first about truth in the real world, about “indubitable” self-evident truth. Why think that a priori justification implies that this sort of justification is entitled to ignore empirical information ? Why couldn't a priori justification be defeated by empirical, not just a priori, considerations? Something like this has actually happened, Kant was a priori justified in believing that every event has a cause but, because of developments in sub-atomic physics, we are not. The principle of sufficient reason is a synthetic a priori and can be "defeated" by another model. The principle is only justified in the framework of a deterministic conception of nature, and contemporary physics does not any more support. In a radioactive particle decay, it is indeterminate if decay or not becomes at time t. The behavior of radioactive particles constitutes a counterexample to the version, as Hume uses, of the principle of sufficient reason: No event, of whatever type, can happen at time t without something determining its occurrence at that instant. The principle of sufficient reason is example of a fake “indubitable“ self-evident truth. The Greeks were a priori justified in accepting Euclidean geometry but we are not because of developments in cosmology. The net effect of Einstein’s use of non-Euclidean geometry in a physical theory was to disestablish the view that mathematics is a source of a priori knowledge about the empirical world. Euclidean geometry then is another example of a fake “indubitable” self-evident cosmological truth. A priori justification allows that experience might defeat a priori justification. One primary dispute is over the source of the a priori knowledge. On one standard interpretation non-inferential, a priori justification is solely justification based on understanding the proposition at issue.The problem in linking a priori warrant to self-evidence is that a priori warrant is compatible with inferential warrant, wherein a proposition owes its warrant to inferential relations with other propositions, as might a theorem in a mathematical system but theorems in mathematics are not always self-evident. It is not obvious that a priori warrant for a proposition requires epistemic indubitability of this proposition. A priori justification for a proposition apparently can be subject to epistemic defeat. Truth's ascription conduciveness is a necessary condition for epistemic justification. The claim that a source of beliefs is truth's ascription conducive is a contingent empirical claim that need be supported by empirical investigation. Outside the real world, in the abstract world of pure mathematics, what can mean truth without provability? What is the sound of one hand clapping? 

This is also elegant and flexible enough (I believe) that it can't be interpreted to mean "every human life must turn out the exact same and we must all have the same set of values." The real beauty of Objectivism, in my opinion, is that it's presentation of an objective moral framework accounts for and explains the illusion of moral relativism within the context of individualism (within the context of an individuals conditional and hierarchical code of values based on that individuals own life). While the "ultimate value" is always the same (that being ones own "life"), and the basic biological questions of what sustains survival are the same, farther removal from these more basic questions doesn't diminish Objectivism's ability to underscore an ought among alternatives... generally in the form of "If you value X over Y then you Ought to Z." 

Ayn Rand is alluding to an even more fundamental realization when understanding the concept of value above and questions, "of value to whom and for what." Essentially what she means by "where no alternative exists, no goals and no values are possible" is explained below... 

What is truth? Characterizing a sentence as true adds nothing new to its content, for ‘It is true that 5 is a prime number’ says exactly the same as just ‘5 is a prime number’. The adjective ‘true’ is redundant and is not a real predicate expressing a real property such as the predicates ‘white’ or ‘prime’ which cannot be eliminated from a sentence without an essential loss for its content (Frege).This idea gave an impetus to the deflationary theory of truth. There is no such property as truth and thus there is no need for, or sense to, a theory of truth distinct from a theory of truth ascriptions. Truth is not taken to be explicitly defined, but rather the truth conditions of sentences are taken to be described. 

If they are wealthy then they don't worry about money they don't worry about money Then they are wealthy. This is "affirming the consequent" fallacy. 1) If P, then Q. 2) Q. 3) Therefore, P. An argument of this form is invalid, the conclusion can be false even when statements 1 and 2 are true. Since P was never asserted as the only sufficient condition for Q, other factors could account for Q. To put it differently, if P implies Q, the only inference that can be made is non-Q implies non-P.
