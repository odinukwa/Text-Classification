The Chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star. Beyond this, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf will typically explode in a type 1a supernova, due to the nuclear reactions at those temperatures. I've heard that oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs, on the other hand, will not ignite. Rather, electron capture becomes energetically favorable and they become neutron stars. If I understand correctly, this also happens for carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in binaries, if the white dwarf has most of the mass in the system. Why is this? Can anyone walk me through, step by step, what happens if a white dwarf (of both compositions) exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, and how each differs? 

This is a basic question, but it's been bugging me. In the Wikipedia article for lithium burning, it states that: 

Generally, as metallicity decreases and mass increases, black holes become more likely to form. At a specific mass and metallicity range, however, there are no remnants left behind. From that point, increasing mass and decreasing metallicity allows for black holes again. How does this work? Why would there ever be an area in which no remnants are left behind? In fact, it seems almost random, since the range lies right between direct black hole ranges. 

Herein lies the problem: your units and exponents are messed up. The mass of your iron isotope is $55.934936 \mathrm{\ u}$, and there are $7.938⋅10^{31}$ atoms. Do the math, and you'd get a total mass of $4.4400513610370694 \times 10^{33}\mathrm{\ u}$. That converts to approximately $7372878 \mathrm{\ kg}$. Nowhere near the mass of the Sun!

(1993) states that at the Sun's zero-age main sequence, it was $0.9R_\odot$ in radius, and at its terminal age main sequence it will be $1.6R_\odot$. That means that, over the course of about 10.9 billion years, the Sun's radius will have increased by $0.7R_\odot$ — about 70% its current radius. If we do the math $\left (0.7R_\odot \over 10.9 \ \text{Gyr} \right )$, we could find that the Sun's average increase in radius (from beginning to end of main sequence) is about 4.5 centimeters each year (1.77 inches). This calculation shouldn't be taken too seriously, since the growth rate is not linear, but it demonstrates how slowly the Sun has been growing. The Sun will continue to grow at a very slow rate until it leaves its main sequence stage. Once it enters the red giant branch, it will grow many times its current size, to approximately 1 AU. Mass The Sun is losing mass for two reasons: the nuclear fusion in its core converts some mass into energy, and high energy protons and electrons are constantly ejected from the Sun's corona as solar winds. Wood et al. (2002) shows that the Sun's mass-loss rate $\dot{M}$ is (approximately) inversely proportional to the square of its age $t$: $$\dot{M} \propto t^{-2.00 \pm 0.52}$$ As of now, $\dot{M} = 10^{-14}\frac{M_\odot}{\mathrm{yr}}$. After the Sun leaves the main sequence, it will lose its mass at a much faster rate. As stated in Sackermann et al., the rate at which it a post-main sequence star loses mass can be generalized with Reimers' law: $$\dot{M} = -\eta (4 \times 10^{-13}) \frac{LR}{M}$$ where $\eta$ is a value depending on the star (derived to be ~0.6 for the Sun), $M$, $L$ and $R$ are in solar units, and $\dot{M}$ is in solar masses per year. This is simplified, but gives us an idea of how the Sun's phase affects its mass-loss rate. By the time the Sun enters the red giant branch, it will have only 72.5% its current mass, and its luminosity and radius will reach $2300L_\odot$ and $170R_\odot$, respectively. Plugging those values in, we find that the rate of mass loss will be $1.3 \times 10^{-7} \frac{M_\odot}{\mathrm{yr}}$. It will lose mass even faster in the asymptotic giant branch, when its mass will become ~54.1% of what it is now, meaning $\dot{M}$ will be $2.5 \times 10^{-7} \frac{M_\odot}{\mathrm{yr}}$. 

So if all the sunlight is blocked, how can we see the Moon? Well, the main reason is that sunlight is often dispersed in the atmosphere, and so it can reach the Moon. In addition, there's airglow, which is when sunlight hits Earth's upper atmosphere and causes multiple chemical reactions, scattering light throughout the night sky. Thus, all this light from Earth, called earthshine, reflects off the Moon and illuminates it. In addition, Earth removes and blocks parts of the sunlight's spectrum, leaving only the longer wavelengths. This causes the Moon to appear red. Lastly, because the Earth blocks off all the direct sunlight from the Sun (only diffracted sunlight and airglow reach the Moon), we can actually see Earth's shadow on the Moon. 

Not sure if these kinds of questions are allowed here, but I may as well answer it. Universe Sandbox 2 is mostly realistic. Its accuracy degrades as you increase the flow of time. The slower the time, the more accurate the calculations. This means that if you want to simulate the Solar System over a long period of time, it won't be very accurate. If you want to simulate day-long events, like planets crashing, it might be better. However, Universe Sandbox 2 uses 300-year old Newtonian physics, rather than general relativity. Newtonian physics just requires n-body mechanics, so it is much easier to implement. General relativity requires simulating the spacetime itself. That is, taking your simulation space, discretizing it to a hi-res 3-D grid and checking the effect that each and every point in that grid has on all neighboring points at every timestep. Instead of simulating N number of bodies, they would be simulating a huge number of points. They would start with some initial data of the shape of spacetime and then see how it evolves according to the Einstein equations, which are 10 highly non-linear partial differential equations. Accurate general relativity simulations require supercomputers. Still, Newtonian physics can get the job done for the most part. The developers seem interested in incorporating some GR concepts, like gravity propagating at the speed of light, spinning black holes and ways to better approximate GR. 

Thus, even though much of the Universe will not be observable by that time, we will ironically have more answers about cosmology than we do today, simply by observing the few extragalactic objects that will be visible. This is the general explanation of how we can find the time since the Big Bang. Remember that even now, we really have no idea about the origins of the Universe — it's a major unsolved problem in physics. All we know is something happened 13.8 billion years ago. Using hypervelocity stars, future humans would be able to determine the time since the Big Bang as well. Don't get your hopes up on humans surviving for 1 trillion years, though. 

The Sun is gradually getting larger and brighter. In fact, as called2voyage pointed out, its brightness is increasing by 1% every 100 million years. You can see how the Sun will change in the future from this graph: (Source) 

The onset of hydrogen fusion for a star (i.e. when it enters the main sequence) is called the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). Conversely, the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS) refers to the point a star stops fusing hydrogen (and by definition leaves the main sequence); the time between the ZAMS and TAMS is called the main sequence lifetime. On the Hurtzsprung-Russell diagram, several stars at their ZAMS are grouped into a line: 

Gravity makes objects compress to their centers of mass, since gravity extends in all directions. For planets, gravity continues compressing the object until the rocks cannot be compressed anymore, since the pressure will fight against gravity. At this point (called hydrostatic equilibrium), the object has become a spheroid. One of the requirements for an object to be called a "planet" is that it has reached hydrostatic equilibrium. For black holes, the shape of their event horizons really depend on whether the black hole is spinning or not. For non-spinning black holes, gravity extends in all directions, so the event horizon will become spherical in shape. For spinning black holes, it will likely be an oblate spheroid. Most galaxies are only spherical when they are forming. Their angular momentum usually causes them to flatten out over time. However, one part of galaxies, called the "halo", is spherical. Wormholes are purely hypothetical, so I won't really entertain that. 

The core of the Earth is hot because of its own density and radioactive materials. Basically, the more you compress an object, the hotter it gets. It does not undergo fusion, since only massive (stellar) objects do so. A significant amount of radioactive decay happens in the core, which is mainly the source of its heat, but no fusion. Similarly, stars are hot because of their own densities, but at a much larger scale, and sans the nuclear decay. This is especially evident when stars are born as non-fusing protostars; they are prevented from getting smaller because as they do so, their core will get hotter. Hotter objects actually expand, so protostars are in a state of equilibrium; if they get any smaller, the temperatures will increase and they will become larger again. However, protostars slowly get smaller and smaller over time. This is because they lose energy as they emit light. Light emission is, in fact, a source of energy loss. So the star will continue to collapse slowly, and once the core reaches a certain density, it will begin fusing hydrogen. This produces radiation pressure, which counters the force of gravity. Again, let me clear up something: nucleosynthesis in stars does not cause heat, but rather it prevents the star's gravitational collapse. It's the star's density that causes such high temperatures. If a star runs out of "fuel", that spells out the last phases of its life — as far as I know, the end result reaches extremely high temperatures (supernovae, white dwarfs, etc.) 

For the past (and next) few billion years, I see the luminosity continuously rising, the temperature remaining about the same, and the radius also rising. This seems bizarre to me. I would imagine that, for luminosity to increase, the temperature would have to increase. And for temperature to increase, the radius would have to decrease (as the core becomes denser, temperatures rise). So why does it work this way? PS: I would also appreciate a concrete explanation for why all three decreased at the beginning of the Sun's life, but suddenly began increasing. 

Not all planets are exoplanets, but all exoplanets are planets. When we differentiate the two, we use "planets" to refer to the eight planets revolving around our Sun. The Greek prefix "exo" (outside) should indicate that exoplanets orbit other stars. In reality, you can call exoplanets "planets", and you'll often hear "Astronomers have found x planets around star y". The word "exoplanet" is used interchangeably with planets from other planetary systems. 

Mass and metallicity are the two main determinants for a star's fate. This is simple enough. What's more complicated is how exactly these determine the star's fate. For example, you can see in this image I got from Wikipedia's supernova article: 

I know all about how black holes form and why their gravity is so strong. However, is the gravity equally powerful in all directions? Will the event horizon appear as a perfect sphere? 

If we take a look at stars more massive than the Sun, their densities vary a lot. UY Scuti is an extremely low-density star that's only 8.5x more massive than the Sun, but is 1000-2000x its size. r136a1, on the other hand, is 256x more massive than the Sun, but is only 30x its size. Neither of them are main-sequence. The Sun has a lower mass than both of them, yet it's also smaller than both of them. It doesn't seem like mass makes a big difference. Both reach hydrostatic equilibrium at completely different sizes. r136a1 has a much stronger gravitational pull than UY Scuti, but it should also have much more radiation pressure, right? So how can we determine the density of a star? Is there a formula?
