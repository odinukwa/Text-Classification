Well, I suppose you can write any Latin-based script in mirror writing, as Leonardo da Vinci famously did, but otherwise I think the answer to your question is "no". 

In linguistics, “why” is usually a bad question. Actually, in several Indo-European languages the old present tense has died out completely and been replaced by the present participle plus copula. This has happened in Hindi and other North Indian languages. There are similar things in other language families, e.g. in Aramaic. English seems to have gone halfway in this direction: the inherited present tense and the participle+copula exist side by side, but they have been differentiated semantically. 

Zipf’s law, as I understand it, is not really about languages, but about statistics and probability. It is just one of several formulations of the fact that many non-arbitrary sequences of numbers (frequency of words in a given corpus; population size of cites in relation to their rank; annual turnover of ranked companies; etc., etc.) are not evenly distributed along a decimal scale, but are more or less evenly distributed along a logarithmic scale. As such, it ought to work with all language corpora, including texts that avoid the use of certain letters. 

I agree with Thomas that the situation in English and in German is not the same. I do not, however, agree that “einer” (nom. sing. m.) is an article. The indefinite article in the nom. sing. m. is “ein”. “Einer” is primarily a cardinal number. “Einer der besten Fußballspieler” is parallel to “Zwei der besten Fußballspieler”. In both languages “einer/one” functions in certain contexts as a pronoun (“einer ist gekommen” in the sense “someone came”), but English has gone further than German in this direction. Thus in English you say “the big ones and the little ones”, but in German you cannot say this; you need to say “die großen und die kleinen”. 

The cited Wikipedia article is extremely weak. “Elsewhere it is a very light sound, and is frequently silent, as in hutan ~ utan ('forest'), sahut ~ saut ('answer'), like Romance languages.” First of all, this is ungrammatical (it should be “as in Romance languages”). More significantly, it appears that the anonymous author does not understand the difference between phonology, phonetics, and spelling. The "h" in (for example) French “homme” is not a “very light sound” but merely a historic spelling for /zero/. Malay /h/ is a phoneme, which can be realised phonetically in different ways, though to call it “a very light sound” is not exactly the pinnacle of phonetic sophistication. Insofar as it is a phoneme, it is legitimate to represent it with a single symbol /h/ in phonological transcription. 

Akkadian šēdu is probably cognate with Arabic saʽd “happiness”. Aramaic šēδā and Hebrew šēδ are most probably borrowings from Akkadian, with reversal of the meaning (“good spirit” > “pagan god” > “evil spirit”).The proto-Semitic form would then be *s1aʽd. $URL$ 

English and other Latin-script writing systems have upper case, lower case, italic, bold etc. Arabic has as many as four different forms for each letter (initial, medial, final, isolated). It is all a question of how you define "case". 

First of all I would like to say that these words are not cognates; they are loanwords. The coffee plant is indigenous in the highlands of Ethiopia. It was transplanted to the Yemen in the 14th century (which is fairly recent), where the drink coffee became popular among Sufi circles, and was soon after exported to Istanbul, and hence to Europe. For a long time coffee was produced only in the Yemen and the Horn of Africa. The “coffee” word comes from Arabic qahwa, originally the name for a sort of wine, but which the Yemeni coffee-drinkers transferred to their favourite tipple. It has been claimed, but never proved, that it has antecedents in one or the other of the languages of Ethiopia, but until proven otherwise, it is more likely that the Ethiopian names are borrowed from Arabic. Arabic qahwa was borrowed into Turkish as kahve, and from Turkish to Dutch koffie, French café etc. The native Ethiopian word for “coffee” (the plant and the drink) is būn. In most Arabic dialects bunn is the berry and qahwa is the drink, but in the Yemen bunn is used both for the berry and the drink. The Dutch traders identified, by folk-etymology, Arabic bunn with Dutch boon “bean”, and it is for this reason that in English too we wrongly refer to “coffee beans”. Coffee is not made from beans but from the dried seeds of coffee berries. There are languages that have invented new words for "coffee", but in virtually all languages in the world the principal word for coffee derives from one or the other of the mentioned Arabic words. Here is an excellent scholarly discussion of the whole complex: $URL$ 

If I may answer the second of your two interesting questions. As a rule, Aeolic, Doric and some other Greek dialects retain original /ā/ where Ionic and Attic have shifted it to η. This is a famous characteristic of Ionic/Attic. But I cannot think of any examples where Attic ω stands for η in other dialects. There might be examples, but it is certainly not a regular correspondence. I am not aware that the name (P)sappho has an accepted Greek etymology. In the absence of an etymology this all remains rather speculative. 

This question is in fact hotly debated. Some reputable scholars maintain that English “frame” is a borrowing from Old French, which had it from a Germanic form like *hraman, with hr > fr. In this case “frame” and “Rahmen” are cognates. See the “Etymologie” section here: $URL$ 

The seven-day week is first attested in about the first century BC, in two different forms: the planetary week (where each day is associated with one of the seven visible planets) and the numbered week (where most of the days have the names of numbers, beginning with 1 = Sunday). The planetary week is first attested in Rome, while the numbered week appears to be a Jewish invention, later adopted by Christians. Some modern languages (like English) use a form of the planetary names, others a form of the numbered week (e.g. Portuguese, Modern Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Persian etc.). The Chinese names for the days of the week are a modern innovation. On the other hand, the numbering of the twelve months of the lunar calendar is an ancient Chinese tradition, continued by the present-day use of numbers for the Gregorian months. 

It is from the preverb ad and the stem of the verb venio, namely ven-, Indo-European *gʷm-. Actually, adventus is two different words: the perfect passive participle adventus (genitive adventi), from *gʷm-to-, like Sanskrit gata-, and the noun adventus (genitive adventūs), from *gʷem-tu-, like Skt gantu-. The two forms coalesce in Latin in the nominative singular. 

Nişanyan’s Turkish etymological dictionary is available on line: $URL$ It is an excellent resource which clearly identifies the Arabic, Persian and other loanwords in modern Turkish. If you want to pursue the borrowings in the opposite direction (Turkish to Persian) there is “Türkische und mongolische Elemente im Neupersischen : unter besonderer Berücksichtigung älterer neupersischer Geschichtsquellen, vor allem der Mongolen- und Timuridenzeit“, in four thick volumes, by Gerhard Dörfer. 

The linked Wikipedia article (for what little it may be worth) does not claim that the Arabic word is borrowed directly form proto-Slavic. It says that it is “from Ottoman Turkish نمسه (nemse) or نمچه (nemçe), from Serbo-Croatian Nemac, from Proto-Slavic *němьcь” that is: from Turkish, which has it from Serbo-Croat, which derives ultimately from Proto-Slavic. The Arabic < Turkish < Slavic part of this is probably correct. Whether it goes all the way back to proto-Slavic can be debated. Of course, Arabic speakers never had contact with proto-Slavs. 

Good up-to-date dictionaries are under copyright and not on line. I suggest you get a reader's ticket at a well stocked university library. 

Until fairly recently, pupils in elite schools in European countries began learning Latin and Greek at a very early age, and gained a high level of fluency before going on to university; this included the ability to translate into Latin and Greek (“composition”). At university a large portion of students enrolled for Classics, and a small number of these went on to become professors of Greek and Latin. By this stage they were very fluent indeed. Nowadays this is fairly rare, though I think that the current professors of Classics in places like Cambridge and Oxford still have this kind of background. 

The transcription /ˈdɪkʃ(ə)n(ə)ɹɪ/ is not very good either. In British “received pronunciation” you can say either /ˈdɪkʃənɹɪ/ or /ˈdɪkʃənəɹɪ/, but you cannot say */ˈdɪkʃnɹɪ/ or */ˈdɪkʃnəɹɪ/. The twice bracketed /(ə)/ is misleading. 

I join Alennano in hoping that you realise that French, Spanish and Italian are Romance languages, while English and German are Germanic languages. There is some disagreement about the sub-grouping of Romance: many (though perhaps not all) scholars posit a division into Eastern Romance (Italian, Romanian and the other Balkan Romance languages) and Western Romance (Gallo-Romance and Ibero-Romance). Any such division has to be based on shared innovations within each sub-group. There is no doubt that Spanish and Italian sound rather similar to each other, and sound rather different from French or Portuguese, but this is because Spanish and Italian are both phonologically quite conservative (that is: their sound system has changed less than other Romance languages in comparison with Latin). This is a shared retention and is not relevant for sub-grouping, which needs to be based on shared innovations only. 

Greek initial /h/ develops regularly from IE *s and non-syllabic *i. But (as you mention) initial υ always has rough breathing, even where it was not preceded by etymological /s/ or /j/. One explanation that has been considered is that Greek initial /u/ developed a /j/ on-glide, very much as has happened in English (unit, use, united…), which then partook in the development of inherited /j/ to /h/. 

A Vietnamese word like khiếu contains a core vowel [i] followed by two off-glides [ɜ] and [w]. The first is definitely not an on-glide. Words of this type are very common in Vietnamese and in other South-East-Asian languages.
