The set of maps $S^n \to S^m$ is better known as $\pi_n(S^m)$. The one other (than n=m) relatively easy case is when we tensor by the rational numbers (and thus answer the question "when is f homotopic to g after adding each to itself some number of times?). The answer in this case is they are always homotopic if m is odd or if m is even and $n \neq 2m - 1$. If $m$ is even and $n = 2m-1$ then $f$ and $g$ are homotopic in this weak sense if and only if they both have non-trivial (or both have trivial) classical Hopf invariant. 

The most basic example is of course ordinary homology and cohomology, which are quite familiar, but worth revisiting since there are actually a few different models of this philosophy. The standard geometric model for homology is chains, and then cohomology can be obtained as a "formal linear dual." But in an oriented manifold, one can show that differential forms provide functionals on chains and go on to establish the de Rham theorem. Or one can take proper submanifolds as partially-defined cochains and get an intersection-theoretic interpretation of cohomology. Or one can decide that de Rham theory is so wonderful that it should be the basic theory, and then passing to linear duals from there leads to the theory of currents to represent homology. Another example which works very easily but is not as well known is bordism and cobordism. By definition bordism groups are defined by maps from manifolds. Cobordism is typically defined by maps to Thom spectra, but standard transversality shows that such maps are represented by proper submanifolds. The linear/Poincare/Lefshetz duality between bordism and cobordism is given by intersection theory. The Index Theorem manifests this philosophy for K-theory. K-theory cohomology classes are of course represented by formal sums (or complexes) of vector bundles. K-homology, as developed in Higson and Roe's book, is represented by Fredholm operators. The pairing between them is roughly "counting the dimensions of spaces of solutions of an operator on a vector bundle." (On some planet with very advanced topologists but relatively weak other flavors of math, one could envision the topologists "inventing" this kind of analysis just so they could have more fun with K-theory.) While the analysis (pseudodifferential operators and the like) which shows that Fredholm operators "pair" with vector bundles is standard enough, showing that there is such a homology theory is of course involved, and takes up much of the Higson-Roe book. Thus, the Index Theorem follows immediately from the stronger statement that one can define K-homology theory using differential operators and that the pairing between that and K-theory is given by the Index. In order to get the cohomology statement, as Paul Siegel mentions above, one uses the Chern character to translate from K-theory to cohomology but then must multiply by the Todd genus because the Chern character does not preserve Thom classes. I realize that this stronger statement while perhaps feeling plausible is more of a formal answer than the geometric answer (like for Gauss-Bonnet) that you sought. But when I studied the Index Theorem, mostly on the topological side, years ago I found that this formalism did help me develop some "pictures" for some of the arguments (for example the Fredholm theoretic proof Bott periodicity etc). By the way, while we're mentioning this philosophy, there is one case which is very much a hot/interesting topic, namely for elliptic cohomology where objects like conformal nets, higher categories and "stringy" topology of manifolds all need to be further developed to tell the story. 

Those who reply that being able to compute homotopy groups is akin to being able to compute values of L-functions are perhaps unwittingly referring to a great parallel: stable homotopy groups of spheres are the "algebraic K-theory of finite sets" while, while the algebraic K-theory of number fields is conjecturally related to special values of L-functions (the Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture). What Muller is almost certainly referring to is that homotopy is a powerful functor. For example, Freyd's generating hypothesis conjecture implies that the stable homotopy classes of maps between two finite CW complexes can be faithfully viewed through the module maps, over stable homotopy of spheres, of their stable homotopy. Thus, if we were really good at understanding homotopy groups, then presumably we'd be that much closer to understanding various questions which can be reduced to or require significant input from homotopy theory. Classically, such applications included classifying manifolds up to diffeomorphism - Kervaire and Milnor reduced this question for spheres to one in homotopy. Because rational homotopy groups - really, rational homtopy theory - are more approachable (for example, one gets an upper bound on the homotopy groups of a simply-connected X through the Harrison homology of its cohomology ring), they have been widely-applied in geometry. See for example the book "Algebraic Models in Geometry" by Felix-Oprea-Tanre, which discusses topics ranging from group actions to symplectic manifolds to geodesics to toric topology to configuration spaces. One could presumably get much sharper results in all of these areas with homotopy over the integers. But homotopy theorests are generally more excited these days by potential application to algebra itself. The sphere spectrum, whose coefficients are the stable homotopy groups of spheres, plays the same role in the world of $E_\infty$-algebra ("derived" commutative algebra) as the integers do in algebra - this is one philosophical starting point of Lurie's opus. 

[I tried to make this a comment, but ran out of space...] I'm not 100% clear on your question, but do see some possible answer(s). The homotopical generalization of a manifold is a Poincare duality space. Instead of tangent bundles those spaces have "Spivak normal fibrations." This fibration itself or corresponding lifts of the classifying map for this fibration to other structure groups gives rise to characteristic classes for the manifold akin to the stable embedding description you gave. To elaborate on this structure group idea, a fiber bundle (for simplicity) F -> E -> X can in many cases be classified by a map from X to the classifying space BAut(F), of the space of automorphisms of F (could be homeomorphisms but could also be linear maps if F is a vector space, holomorphic maps if F is complex, symplectic homeos... you get the picture). If G -> Aut(F) is any homomorphism (usually an injection), one can ask if the classifying map X -> BAut(F) lifts to a map from X -> BG. Informally, this lift exists if "G has enough data to make this bundle." (For example, if G is the trivial group, then one is asking if the bundle is trivial.) If it does, then the cohomology of G would give rise to a collection of characteristic classes for X. Here G can not only be other groups of Lie type but in principle could be any kind of group. The rub is finding something "useful" as you allude. Sure, the Monster could be a structure group for the tangent bundle of my manifold. But outside of the classical linear groups and maybe some cases in which say G is elementary abelian, both concrete applications and general theory are hard to come by. In the end, I don't think there is a clean answer for what is the right categorical setting, as abelian categories are to chain complexes. For basic characteristic classes you just need (functorial) classifying spaces and (generalized) cohomology. There are certainly settings other than the usual category of topological spaces where those exist and I could imagine some sensible axioms one could develop. But again one would be pretty far from having say all of the structure of Chern classes at hand. For characteristic classes of manifolds, you would need generalizations of the notion of Poincare duality space with its Spivak normal fibration. I don't know of any other categories where those exist (though I wouldn't be surprised if there were). 

Recall Thom's result that cobordism groups are homotopy groups of Thom spaces/ spectra. The characteristic numbers of $[M]$ are encoding the image of the corresponding element of $\pi_* MO$ under the Hurewicz(/Boardman) map to $H_* (MO)$ (which you may recall is isomorphic to $H_*(BO)$). So your question is essentially "what is the image of this Hurewicz map?" The complex analogue of this question was answered by Adams in his "Stable Homotopy" book, using the framework of formal group laws; the $MO$ question has a similar answer. 

Some of the best results known along these lines are in the paper "Algebraic models of Poincare embeddings" (which used to be called "Algebraic models of complements...") by Lambrechts and Stanley. See: $URL$ Briefly, it seems that even if the complement is simply connected, there are examples of what you seek when the codimension is too small, and when the codimension is large enough the rational homotopy type of a complement is determined. 

Through the Pontrjagin-Thom construction, a framed $n-k$ manifold in $S^n$ determines a map from $S^n$ to $S^{n-k}$. $\eta$ is represented by $S^1$ in $S^3$ with framing which "twists around once". The suspension of $\eta$ is represented by $S^1$ in $S^4$ lying in the equatorial $S^3$ with framing which is the product of this "twist once" framing within $S^3$ and the trivial framing in the normal direction, etc. The composite is represented by an $S^1 \times S^1$ with a framing which is "twist around once" on each factor. 

Let me offer another definition not far from obstruction theory (as Ilya gave), but without referring to obstruction theory and thus more elementary. Suppose for simplicity that $X$ is a simplicial complex, and the bundle $E$ is piecewise-linear (trivialized over each simplex, with transition maps over common faces which are linear) and of dimension $n$. First consider a piecewise-linear section on the $n$-skeleton of $X$ with isolated zeros (such sections are dense in the space of all sections). Then the Euler class, which is the $n$th SW class $w_n(E)$, is represented by the cochain whose value on an $n$-simplex $\sigma$ is the (mod-two) count of the zeros of that section on $\sigma$. Fun exercises: show this is a cocycle, and that different choices of sections give rise to cohomologous cocycles. More generally, consider $i$ different sections over the $n-i+1$ skeleton which are linearly dependent at only a finite collection of points. The SW class $w_{n-i}$ evaluates on some $n-i$ simplex $\sigma$ as the count of the points of dependence of these sections. I like to teach SW classes from this perspective first because it is an explicit, cochain-level definition and thus illustrates that there are good geometric reasons to consider cochains. But then I do like to go ahead and develop the classifying space perspective as well, using Milnor's axioms and uniqueness theorem to connect them. I conjecture (but cannot be sure) that at Milnor's time this kind of "dependence of sections" approach was widely known, so he could assume some of that familiarity as he stressed axiomatics. 

One topological significance of these iterated integrals is that they can be used to model the bar complex on the de Rham cochains of a manifold, and thus in some sense the "de Rham complex" of the manifold's loop space since $H_*(Bar(\Lambda^* X)) \cong H^*(\Omega X)$ [Here I am using $\Lambda$ for the de Rham complex and $\Omega X$ to denote loops]. For a simply-connected space, this bar complex gives a reasonable way to encode the rational homotopy type, though Sullivan models have been more popular. So in particular, one can understand a complete set of homotopy functionals (that is, the linear dual of homotopy groups) using iterated integrals: Milnor and Moore showed that $\pi_*(X) \otimes {\mathbb Q}$ is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of indecomposibles of $H_*(\Omega X; {\mathbb Q})$; thus the linear dual of homotopy is the "Lie coalgebra of coindecomposibles" of the rational loopspace cohomology of $X$ (again given by Chen integrals if you wish). Chen showed early on that these integrals give information about $\pi_1$ as well (through its nilpotent completion). My coauthor Ben Walter and I have developed a model for rational homotopy types which is close to both the Chen and Quillen models (and compatible with the Sullivan model as well), and clarified the story of functionals on homotopy groups as well. Because of Chen's work, we know that we will have plenty of information to mine in the non-simply connected setting. 

These operations in the singular setting were fully and explicitly developed and generalized beautifully by McClure and Smith (who also credit Benson and Milgram) in their paper "Multivariable cochain operations and little $n$-cubes": $URL$ 

If you want to give the audience some sense for what mathematical argument is about, I like the topic of divisibility rules (by 2, 3, 4, 9, etc). Most people have seen these but take them completely for granted - indeed, some people take "ends in an even digit" as a suitable definition for even number. One main characteristic which separates mathematicians from the rest of the world is seeing such a rule and asking "does that always work, and if so why?" So perhaps one could first put some plausible false rules out there to create some doubt and the arguments that these rules work - both with algebra and if possible avoiding algebra. I found that emphasizing this material worked well in a class I taught for future elementary school teachers. I told them that even most/ all of their science major friends who passed AP calculus didn't really know why these rules work, so they had learned something special.
