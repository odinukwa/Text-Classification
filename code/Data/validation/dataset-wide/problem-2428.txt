Everyone, every place, every nation, every atom & molecule have to play their part in the universe which has been labeled as both: 

India, or I will refer to a more accurate word for the region currently labeled by the British as India; Bharat by its name & history has been the center of spiritual evolution & wisdom; flavors of knowledge & wisdom have emanated from that region. Each person & place has to play a role, something special to play its karma in the universe. So, while Americans always fight off alien invasions courtesy of their Hollywood machinery and brilliant influence on world pop culture, silently the spiritual flavors of ancient wisdom have been reaching the corners of the world over centuries or more. 

Given my time with the reading & practice of Zen, Buddhism & Sanatan dharma with a lot of spiritual people, I'll answer this from a different Point of View. Jayarava's answer is perfectly accurate to say why people in various places and cultures portray the enlightened Master the look up to in different ways. 

Which is the reason why people traveled to spread the word. Its also the reason why the missing years of Jesus, it is said he was in Bharat, in an area called Kashmir where his name has been found mentioned as 'Isa' or 'Issa' {pronounced: Eee- Saa - h} 

That which is formless & beyond all attributes cannot be 'sensed' or perceive using a Sense of the Body (or even an Xray or Infra red vision). That which has no form, is infinite & all pervasive cannot be measured like an physical object with 'defined' dimensions. It 'comes' as an experience. :) It's not something you can switch on, on demand; Unless you are enlightened - Then you already know that everything is infinite. At that point your senses & your body and everything else is just a virtual construct. 

Adding a note since someone hit negative on my answer :) just because they disagree - opposite of what Buddha or any enlightened master teaches us. So, Masters did not belong to Nations. If anything, every time a Master has come to the planet, they have come to help whoever they can reach, directly or indirectly. Masters do not associate with Nations, Cultures or People, It is the Nations, Cultures and People who identify with associate with a Master. Hence, people take on rituals & rites, methods & flavors; and later even fight with other groups over those details. Masters do not create factions, they join everyone, or should I say they are here to "remind" and "make us realize" that we are already ONE. So, when they teach LOVE thy neighbor or Compassion, those are not for the other, but to for US, to realize the Oneness and practice it as something you are not doing for other, but for yourself :) Hence the term "self realization", reminding and realizing that we are the all-pervasive universe - everything & nothing. :) 

oh holy beans. I'm about to go radical here and diverge from the dalai lama's take, but I can't speak from someone else's perceptions, so here goes. a system based on ever-increasing gains from a finite thing is inherently unsustainable. and lookie! does it kinda seem I'm right? I'm fine with making a living (and more fine just living) but not with profit. because I would prefer to continue rather than dwindle from lack of food, water, and liveable weather, and prefer doing so among healthy people whose basic needs are met. the bible doesn't like profit either. it calls profit "usury." nutshell: profit is taking more than you give. profit is the essence of capitalism. you are looking to "capitalize" on what you encounter, to take from it to make yourself "bigger" if you will. my experience in Buddhism and related things is that there's no need to fret over abstract things that are basically the water you, little fishie, swim in right now. if you keep meditation, continue to refine your clear seeing of yourself and others, notice what happens when things are/aren't done, and how differences in doing/not doing get different results, notice how you feel after doing/skipping the things you do .... your views and habits will change to naturally reflect where you are at any given time. just as they change when you don't meditate, but in ways that are more random and that you may not even like. the only universe, the only sentient being, you can directly and fully perfect is you. and you are the system. whatever it is "you" are, that is what touches and changes every single part of our world, aka "the world," reality, life. as my teacher says, "just do your practice." people are all sorts of things. balance for living beings is a state change that suits conditions at the time (homeostasis). with clarity comes being more of what you are, be it student, statesman, horse trainer, layabout, kite maker, baby maker, musician, pizza guy. the title, like the name of a system, is just the moving form that contains a slice of life. as a living being you will naturally be happiest with things that support life rather than suck it dry. if capitalism furthers living, how is it against Buddhism? if it does not, how will it continue to exist? beings are expressions of life. with clarity life flourishes. systems support life or fail to. our awareness is what decides. 

What matters is what you do when you are single. If being single means using prostitutes to satisfy one's sensual desires, it could lead one further away from the path as compared to a person who restrains himself to one woman and practices loyalty, kindness, doing good deeds together etc. But if being single means being celibate and using one's free time for meditation etc., one would generally have a higher chance of progressing in the path as compared to the average family man. In the time of the Buddha, there were monks who went to forest for seclusion and ended up having sex with monkeys. So what really matters is what you do when you are single. 

This doesn't mean that the lord Buddha always appeared with a halo. It would seem that he appeared that way whenever it would cause Sadda in a person and bring them towards the Dhamma. 

The problem with this question is that you assume that the present body is the only matter available for the mind to hold on to. The whole universe is full of matter that is conducive to the continuation of the mental stream. There are 4 ways for the mental stream to find a new body. Namely, egg-born beings (andaja), womb-born beings (jalabuja), moisture-born beings (samsedaja), and beings having spontaneous births (opapatika). 

The action(good or bad) with the highest Karma points above a certain lower limit. The most recent action(good or bad) done with Karma points above a certain lower limit. But this limit should be much less than in the case of #1 The most frequently done action(good or bad) above a certain lower limit for the number of times it was done. A randomly picked action from all the past levels that wasn't previously used for determining the next level. 

Post-mortem rebirth? Isn't post-mortem implied in the common understanding of the word rebirth? Sounds like you are trying so hard to be in conformity with someone's custom usage of words. :) 

Also, bear in mind that suffering in the first noble truth doesn't just mean pain. A pleasurable experience is also an instance of suffering as it is subjected to change and death. 

One plays or listens to music because of the wanting to please the ears. That is indeed unwholesome. But this does not break any of the five precepts or go against the right livelihood. So playing music for entertainment/money is allowed for a layman.
