If you're not measuring and tracking what your body fat percentage is doing, you probably should be. A scale that can provide some kind of measurement for body fat would be a good investment, and you can find them for around $40 USD. It doesn't even have to be 100% accurate, as long as you can get some kind of measurement to track changes. My bathroom scale reads 3-4% different than when I had my fat percentage checked by a doctor. Doesn't matter because I'm only interested in the trend: decreasing, maintaining, or (heaven forbid) gaining. If this is your first effort to build fitness and lose weight, you can spend several months replacing fat with muscle throughout your body, and your weight may not change much at all. Tracking your body fat would verify this. Lastly, don't get discouraged. There are many people in this world who struggle to lose a couple pounds in a year. You've shown yourself that you are capable of sticking with it to lose your 10 pounds in the last 8 months. So keep going. You'll get there. 

Anecdotally, I've seen great benefits from breathing only through my nose as often as possible, not just when running. Living in a dry climate, I often ended up with a semi-permanent sore throat when running or cycling a lot. Switching to nose-only breathing initially slowed me down significantly, but in a couple of months I was right back where I started, but feeling much more relaxed when I run. Disclosure: My fitness has degraded significantly in the last 6 months, as I quit my job to go back to being a full-time student to finish my degree, then moved to a different state and started another job. Before that, I was able to run several miles (~10) at a comfortable 9:30 minute per mile pace while only breathing through my nose. There is a summary of some of the research done by Dr. Lieberman at Harvard here. 

You may want to check out the Hacker's Diet. It includes some online monitoring tools that help quantify your progress in a meaningful way, and the exercises it uses are good, general-purpose ways to improve total fitness levels. It was created by an engineer, and takes an algorithmic, logical approach to the weight-loss program. Ultimately, exercise alone is a very difficult way to lose weight, but exercise combined with quantifiable data on how your exercise and what you eat affects your goals is working so far for me. 

Last week I started noticing some pain building in my right hip after my morning runs, culminating on last Wednesday when I could barely walk without severe pain in the afternoon. I took a few days of rest and went to the doctor yesterday, where he told me the most likely cause was trochanteric bursitis. I'm still ok to run, although I'm supposed to take it easy, and he gave me a list of hip stretches and exercises to help with my hip strength and flexibility. I'm trying to run the Ragnar Relay Wasatch Back in June, and I'd like to still be able to do that. Is there anything else I can do to keep the pain down (or get rid of it) so as to be able to train effectively for the race? 

It doesn't sound like you're necessarily injured per se, but that you've definitely overdone your training. As stated in answers and comments to your other question, back off the distance, speed, or both for a bit. Your body needs time to adapt. 

Hence, the suggestion of intervals is a good one. This allows you to burn and recover (somewhat) in turns and increase your workout duration beyond what you could do if you're close to your maximal heart rate all the time. Alternatively, there is the notion of base building, where you just slow down until you're exercising in a mid-range heart rate and go longer. Many athletes perform this type of exercise in the "off season". The idea being that you're performing at a level where your body can still acquire some of its energy by converting and burning fat, but high enough that you're training your body to work a bit harder. The goal of this type of exercise, then, is to increase the duration for which you can perform at a given heart rate (say 60-75 percent of max) and also increase the speed at which you can perform at that same heart rate. Then, once you've built up a larger aerobic base capability, you can add intervals, hills, speed work, etc. to add power and speed to your ability to "go long". A good estimate for the sort of base building heart rate you may want (give or take a bit) is 180 - your age. Staying within 5 or 10 bpm of this will provide a bit of flexibility, especially when starting out as it's hard to measure effort. Another thing to note is that this requires a lot of patience. If you're just starting out and running for 8-10 minutes ramps you immediately into 190-200 bpm, you may find that to keep your heart rate in base building range you have to go at not much more than a slow shuffle, or walk 100 yards and run 50, or some such. This can be pretty frustrating, but in my experience has been well worth it. 

There are widely varying stances on optimal exercise heart rate, but there is some common ground that most people agree on. 

The main indicator of "fat burning" in different exercises boils down to your rate of calorie burn, and how long you maintain that rate. Cycling is not a bad way to lose fat by that metric, since as you get trained up you can maintain a reasonable rate of burn for quite a long duration. Cycling burns (depending on the speed/amount of effort) several hundred calories per hour. When I'm out on a long ride I refuel at the rate of 150 or so calories per hour. Assuming that I don't completely erase that by overeating after a ride I get to keep that deficit for that day. All this being said, cycling 20-30 minutes per day is likely to make you stronger, but not trim you down super fast. Edit: Should have been more clear on this, but cycling doesn't burn more calories per hour than running (or some other exercises). Cycling is, however, lower impact and for some people more enjoyable than running, allowing a greater amount of time in the calorie burning zone. 

Some kids' motor skills develop at rates different than the other kids their age. This is a somewhat tricky area since in order to develop them, she needs to engage in some repetitious activity, and young children are often not fond of repetitious activity that isn't their idea. The earlier answer that mentioned kicking a soccer ball against a wall and making a game out of it is a pretty good idea. Other things that will help are (oddly enough) things like playing hop-skotch, skipping, and jumping rope. Anything that requires balance shifts, direction changes, and exact foot/hand placement will work, as long as it's fun for her. Keep in mind that if it's not fun she won't want to do it enough for it to help her motor skills. And keep in mind that some children simply develop those skills slower than others. I was unable to jump rope until I was like 10. But I went on to play JV basketball, take 5th in the State Wrestling Tournament, 8th in the 100m dash, and 5th in the 400m dash in high school.
