We have never had a tent with windows, only 2-person backpacking tents. I agree with DudeOnRock's answer, and will add only one point. The door, when unzipped, on a small backpacking tent is equivalent to a very large open window. The door can be zipped partially closed to any degree. Even in the worst weather, the door can be periodically partially unzipped to fend off claustrophobia or increase ventilation. As for the OP's question about hot and stuffy: We do all our backpacking in the Sierra or the Rockies, most of it above timberline. The only time the tent can get hot there is in midday in full sun. As for stuffy, we find the vents plus fiddling with the door gives us as much or as little ventilation as we want. We regard a tent as emergency equipment only, and if it is not actually raining or snowing, prefer to sleep outside, where we can see the stars. A ground squirrel running over the sleeping bag is something to enjoy, not avoid. 

Impetus for the Question: Some years ago, a young and colorful colleague of mine described a paragliding adventure in Colorado in which he went too high, passed out, and inadvertently landed in a tall tree. He was stuck in the tree for 18 hours before he extricated himself, unscathed. Why 18 hours, and exactly how he got down, I don't remember. It is also possible that he enhanced his story a bit. The Question: What skills should one learn and practice on the ground or close to the ground before taking off? Tree down-climbing? Navigation? Recognizing when one has exceeded safe altitude? Other? What does one do to prepare the right muscles for the physical exertion peculiar to this sport? Are there courses which teach all this, and, if so, how long does this preparation take? And, PS, does the story of my colleague sound plausible? 

We have never hiked in temperatures that went up to 95 F, but we have taken oranges on much longer trips than 2-3 days, with no problem, with day-time temperatures in the low 80s, and very sunny skies. As others have said, put the fruit in a plastic bag in the middle of your pack; it will be protected from being squashed, and insulated to some degree from the heat. On a long trip, the last can of concentrated OJ that we opened had fermented. OJ wine is pretty bad. 

Today's Washington Post reported that the state of Massachusetts plans to establish a sanctuary for timber rattlesnakes on an off-limits 1,400 acre island in the Quabbin Resevoir, 65 miles west of Boston. The reservoir is the largest body of water in Massachusetts. There are only 200 timber rattlesnakes left in Massachusetts "in five scattered pockets from Greater Boston to the Berkshires". The fear is that they could disappear from the state because of loss of habitat and being killed by humans. How well do these snakes swim? 

The plane carried extensive arctic survival gear, but much of it was lost in the crash and subsequent fire. 

Ken Graham has a great deal of useful information in his answer, which I will not repeat. But the OP has specifically asked how to deal with a rabid animal's carcass when he is out hunting. However, the OP has not specified how populated the area is, or whether the hunter is alone or with companions. The most important instructions are do nots: do not touch the carcass and do not let your dog(s) get at it. The next most important: report it. I am going to try to simplify and shorten my answer. The bottom line is that you, yourself, may not be able to do anything with the corpse. You probably don't have the heavy plastic bags you need to double bag it and carry it out safely even a short distance, nor a shovel to bury it the recommended four feet deep, nor anything to safely manipulate it into a bag (e.g., a shovel). You may not even have heavy duty work gloves with you. As for burning it -- no. The policy quoted in Ken Graham's answer is overkill for a single carcass, but it should give you pause. You help nobody by exposing yourself to rabies. Your responsibility is to report it and, to the best of your ability, guard against others stumbling upon the carcass, for example domestic animals or children. Thus, after making sure your dogs will not get at it, report it. Your first choice is Animal Control. Other possibilities are the local game warden, the owner of the land or the agency managing the land or the police. I am now going to assume that you are not in the middle of nowhere, but in a rural area and not far from your car or from other people (e.g., a farmhouse). If you can get through to none of the responsible agencies, and if you have a companion, one of you walks out to report in person, and the other stays to make sure no one stumbles upon the carcass. If you are alone, and have gotten only recorded messages telling you to leave a message, then, after waiting a reasonable time for a call-back, as a last resort call 911. (The recorded message might well happen with Animal Control, owners and wardens, but I'd be unhappy if it happened with the police.) It's better not to leave the carcass unattended if there is a significant chance that a domestic animal or a child will happen by. If you are in the middle of nowhere, report the carcass when you get out. Whatever burying you can do is likely to be ineffective. If the vultures are gathering, let them have it. They can eat rabid carcasses with no ill effect. It's tempting to think of hauling it out. Think. Can you securely double bag the carcass without touching it? Can you haul it out without touching it? If the answer is "maybe not", don't try. You also have to worry about fleas. Footnote: In a carcass, the virus can persist for days. Science Direct. The isolated virus degrades more quickly. 

There isn't much difference in the two "acclimatization" options. In neither option do you get more than a start on acclimatization. In both options, you serve notice on your body to get ready. Option 2 might be "safer" in that your chances for a good night's sleep and a good dinner are better at the hotel than the hut. Thus, you might start the climb more rested. But Option 1 might be "safer" in that whatever problems you might have, might manifest themselves at the level of the hut, or soon thereafter. So, my answer is go with what you want to get out of the total experience. Is the camaraderie at the hut important? Is spending a night at 11,800 feet, far from the tourist crowd at the base of the mountain important? (Is sleeping outside the hut under the stars possible?) Assuming you are in good shape, and knowing that you have had no trouble at 10,800, and knowing that you will be with a (presumably) reputable guide, and assuming that if you feel awful you will be sensible, then flip a coin or go with your gut. Nothing is certain; you could get run over tomorrow. We had a similar experience 10 years ago in Chile. We were staying at San Pedro de Atacama (about 8,500 feet) and went to the Tatio geysers (about 13,000 feet) in the morning. Then we walked up Cerro Tocco (about 18,400 feet) in the afternoon and had no problems, not even mild headaches. (But what was OK for us might not be OK for someone else, and vice versa.) 

How long does it take for trash to become an historical artifact in the United States? There appears to be a legal answer, which is "50 years". It is not clear whether this legal answer applies only to Federal land. The clean-up link takes the reader to a site under the aegis of the National Park Service and which refers to a cache of cans at Big Bend National Park. Let's assume we are talking only about Federal land. I don't want imply that I take breaking the law lightly, but let's bear in mind that the saying below, made famous by Charles Dickens and dating back to at least 1654, is sometimes true. 

I used a three quarter length foam pad -- just the basic $20 (or so) Ensolite pad -- for decades until, growing older and more effete, I thought an inflatable pad, aka air mattress, would be more comfortable. Wrong! The inflatable air mattress -- more than $100 -- was no more comfortable, but was a PIA to deflate and inflate every time we moved camp. And, as @StrongBad mentioned in his comment, it was slippery: (a) I slipped on it, and (b) it slipped on the ground cloth. (Weather good -- no tent.) As a result of (b) it was punctured before the end of a 10-day trip. Moreover, even when we didn't move camp, we had to deflate the #$@& thing, because it could not be simply rolled up and tied to the pack as could a foam pad. Although this would not have been a nuisance if we had erected the tent, we didn't and it was. In summary, although the inflatable air mattress might have been a bit lighter than the foam pad (I really don't know), it was an object that had to be pampered, and offered no extra comfort. The point about comfort is highly subjective. If you are uncomfortable with the basic foam pad, an air mattress may be worth the hassle and expense. 

As a speculation, you may have a ceiling of about 16,500 feet. This speculation is reinforced by your starting to feel stronger as you passed 16,500 on the way down. Was this the first time you climbed above 16,500? My husband had an office mate -- very tough, fit guy -- who puked regularly at 13,000 feet, and felt awful. Finally he accepted his ceiling. You had AMS; you were very wise to go down when you did. (Better had you gone down earlier.) Whether you have a ceiling or whether you will be able to exceed the apparent ceiling of 16,500, no one can say, at this point -- unless you have a past history of climbing successfully above 16.5 that you did not include in your Q. If you choose to try again (in your position, I would not push it again) don't get overtired beforehand (a day off can't hurt), sleep well the night before, warn your companions, be hyper-vigilant and be prepared to turn around when your body tells you to. If the symptoms of this trip recur, don't push it; get down. Get down before you feel "extremely exhausted". You could pass the point of collapse quickly if you continue. if you collapse, you are putting other people at risk. Don't wait until your brain does not work before making a decision to go down. It is telling that you felt exhausted going down and that you "never felt like this before". If you ever feel like that again, go down! It's OK to feel exhausted moving up, but you should feel OK when you stop and rest, and you should feel much better as soon as you are on a downslope -- unless you have AMS. The absence of a headache, considering your other symptoms, means nothing. Different people react differently. A headache is not obligatory to have AMS. The more I think about this, the more I think you had a close call. 

The answer is yes, but it may require equipment, which is not just the human ear. The publication quoted below is from Montana State University Disentangling canid howls across multiple species and subspecies: Structure in a complex communication channel. (It is not clear whether this work is part of the Canid Howl Project which welcomes contributions of howls and analysis from non-scientists.) This work identified 21 howl types and 

Floss. If you brush with water only and then floss, your teeth and gums will be OK for even a multi-week trip. The dentist of @Henning advises flossing first, then brushing because "the dirt that you floss out from between the teeth is highly aggressive stuff that shouldn't remain on them." Thus I suggest a vigorous brushing, then flossing, then a light brushing. Pack out your floss! Maybe add a pack of peppermints for a cleaner feel. 

The bear, collared, and well known in the neighborhood because of a characteristic limp, was tracked and killed. 

The accepted answer gives good advice, which I will not repeat here. But although reading about what to do is much better than not knowing anything about what to do, reading is no substitute for hands-on training. I thus add this answer for the record: if you are travelling in an area where avalanches are a known danger, take an avalanche training course! Here is one place to start looking for a course: American Institute for Avalanche Rescue and Education. One-day courses may be available, and an investment of one day (or even two) is a good investment in avalanche country. At a bare minimum, get and learn how to use, the equipment listed in the accepted answer. 

This is not an opinion-based question. For example, if someone were shown doing a quintuple axel on figure skates, anyone who knew anything about skating would point out that a "mere" quadruple axel has never been done, at least not in competition. (The "quad" is a quadruple toe loop.) The link provided by Zack L in his comment, below, has a lot of pertinent information. But I still want to know: could an archer shoot down a low-flying jet plane, even with an arrow with an advanced high-explosive tip? Or is this an HE question? 

A gravel road is not bad. We have a driveway that is gravel for half of its length, and I estimate we drove at least 275 miles on gravel during the last 5 years of our Volvo's life, when it was 12 to 17 years old. Our neighbors, who share the driveway, drove a similar distance in five years in an old, long, low Cadillac, and continue to do so 

If I were a couple of decades younger, I would seriously consider trying climbing in a climbing gym, but I doubt I have enough flexibility, and I would feel horribly out of place. The thing that attracts me is the total concentration required; there are things I want to put right out of my mind at least temporarily. But I am curious: is there a measurable criterion for what level of upper body strength a person should have before even beginning? Are there any other measures of strength or flexibility that are pre-requisites for starting this sport? 

The source for this answer is an article Found a Baby Crow ? on the website of an organization called Pacific Wildlife. I'm not a bird expert by any means, and certainly not a crow expert. Everything I say is from this article; the only experience I have with crows is observing them in our neighborhood for years. So I can say from my observations that they are intelligent and cooperative. To summarize the article: Crows are social and accept adult and baby crows from outside their extended family. Baby crows need to learn foraging and predator avoidance from adult crows, and need to learn how to behave among other crows. Thus, my suggestion that you might adopt the crow as a pet would deny the crow his natural social life with other crows. Would you want to be adopted by a group of giant corvids, however well they fed you? It is, of course, better than starving or being killed by a predator, but is not ideal. The article states: 

Weak hummingbirds may not survive torpor. The site has a link to Hummmingbird First Aid, and the message is that it is extremely difficult for anyone but an experienced rehabilitator to render effective first aid. But there are some things you can do, according to the link. My advice is for one person to undertake the first aid that is safe for a neophyte to do, and another person try to get experienced help. In my area, I would call my vet and the Wildlife Rescue League of Northern Virginia and the Hummingbird Rescue Center in San Diego. I found the HRC quickly by googling hummingbird rehabilitation, and also found a few promising rehabber links in my area, but nothing that focused on hummingbirds. the San Diego Center should be able to direct you to rehabbers in your area, (if there are any.) As to why you are finding dead hummers for the first time after years of no dead hummers, I suggest you call your vet, whatever is the equivalent of the Rescue League in your area, your state's Fish and Wildlife agency and the San Diego Center. My feeling is that they will want to rule out torpor first, but the Fish and Wildlife agency should be interested in the possible use of poisons.
