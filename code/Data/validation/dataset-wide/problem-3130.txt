An Allied tank would fire white phosphorus into the corners to suppress, obscure, or drive off the German machine gun crews and then keep up suppressing fire without exposing the sides of the tank. Mortars and grenades would suppress the surrounding fields to keep the Germans from taking up flanking positions. Finally, engineers would blow a hole in the hedgerow (using pipes shoved in by the tank) to allow the tank to advance for close support. Source "Busting the Bocage: American Combined Arms Operations in France 6 June--31 July 1944" by Captain Michael D. Doubler German tactics had to adapt to Allied air dominance and lavish Allied artillery. To be visible from the air meant death by "Jabos" or "Jagerbombers", the German word for hunting fighter-bombers. To remain static in a known position meant getting shelled. Even a solid German defensive position eventually had to move under the weight of Allied bombardment. 

As mentioned by many here, kill ratios are only really significant if you're talking attrition warfare or at a basic tactical level. Otherwise they're an effect of losing the war, not a cause. The underlying question of why those kill ratios turned against Germany is a very complicated one, but one important aspect is that the Germans had invented a new kind of mobile warfare and the Allies had to play catch up. People often fail to appreciate just how much tactics and technology changed from 1939 to 1945. In the air, all-metal, monoplane military aircraft had only just replaced the biplane in front-line service (and in some cases, such as the Fairey Swordfish, it hadn't). On the ground, radios were bulky and expensive, and communication was still a laborious process often done by runners or cable. Tactically, many units and vehicles still lacked radios limiting the sophistication of their maneuvers and tactics; you can only get so fancy with flags and flares. At sea, the aircraft carrier was still untried, and the submarine still unconquered. The Germans exploited this technological change by increasing the pace of warfare dramatically. They introduced radios at the tactical level, in individual tanks and aircraft. They trained their air, infantry, artillery, and armor to work in concert. They imbued local commanders with the know-how and ability to adapt to the local situation and make local decisions without waiting for orders form higher command. They added paratroopers to overcome strategic obstacles, and tactical air strikes to support deep penetrations. The situation was now liable to change in hours rather than days. This is a pace the Allies were not prepared for. It's a pace that allowed the German army to find gaps and exploit them before the Allies could react. At this pace, the Allies could never be quite sure of where the Germans were. Superior Allied forces were surrounded and cut off as they raced to defend positions that had already been overrun. Faced with this chaotic situation, the Allies often retreated if they were unsure of their flanks. The Germans ran rampant with this new style of warfare from 1939 to 1941, but the remaining undefeated Allies were learning. The Soviets and British learned through facing the Germans, being defeated, and having to rebuild their armies. The Americans were also building an army, but they had the luxury of doing it in peacetime, observing what was going on in Europe, and learning from it. The North African campaign let the US Army learn some hard lessons at a relatively small cost through defeats like Kasserine. 

I don't know about most significant consequences, but I'll note the idea has been around for at least a century. United States v Clark (1933) references the limits of attorney-client privilege while dealing with the limits of juror privilege. Long story short, a juror (Clark) was found to have lied about things that would have disqualified her. Her behavior during deliberation of the jury was used as evidence. Clark tried to have this evidence thrown out claiming juror deliberations are privileged. The judges disagreed writing... 

The Soviets focused on producing and improving three hulls for their armored vehicles, the light T-70, the medium T-34 and the heavy KV/IS line. Their tanks and tank destroyers were all iterative improvements of these three hulls allowing a continuity of production and design. This avoided the long teething problems and retooling of brand new designs so high production could be preserved. In contrast in 1944 the Germans were producing seven hulls and still introducing new ones (the Tiger II) when they should have been focusing on producing known designs. The British also had a dizzying array of production and experimental hulls. The Americans came closest to the Soviet achievement by focusing on the M3/4 medium and M3/5 light, but they also built the specialist M22, M24 and M18 in large numbers and never managed a heavy tank in numbers like the Soviets. The legacy of this focus on just a few tank models lead directly to the idea of the main battle tank. 

By "fair weapon" I take to understand one that both sides have access to in adequate numbers to make it a "fair" fight. Not just one side roflstomping the other with air power or armor so thick nobody could hope to pierce it. But there's more than just availability, there's training. Some weapons require more training to use effectively than others. You can train an effective unit of pikemen or musketeers, for example, relatively quickly. Longbows and swords, on the other hand, require years of training and physical fitness. They require that you have not just the money to buy the weapons, but also the leisure time to train. This is a rather subjective measure, what is a "fair weapon" is specific to the situation. Take muskets for example. Are they a "fair weapon"? If you're an American colonist in 1776, sure! You probably own at least one and have been using it your whole life. But what about an American native in 1776? Or native under the British Raj? In medieval warfare the equivalent of the "totalitarian weapons" might be heavy cavalry, and heavy infantry: professional soldiers (or nobility with a lot of leisure time) with expensive equipment using formations that require a lot of training together. In modern warfare it's things like modern main battle tanks, modern combat aircraft, satellites, complex command and control systems... things that require large support structures and supply chains and a lot of money paid up front to get the best protection and the best gun. In modern warfare the "fair weapons" would be cheap, effective counters to all that. The AK assault rifle; any number of man-portable anti-tank and anti-air weapons; the improvised explosive device (basically booby traps); cell phones with Internet and encryption. If you can use a $30 cell phone and some left over 155mm artillery shells to fashion a trap which damages a $9 million tank and wounds its highly trained crew, that's a fine trade off. But even tanks and aircraft aren't exclusive to the "totalitarian" side. Arms from previous generations, particularly Soviet arms, are so ubiquitous and relatively cheap that a civilian army can get its hands on, for example, a few T-54s. 

Yes. (Note: I started writing a broad answer of various methods to make strong encryption ineffective, rather than banning it outright, and their consequences... but it quickly got off topic. Then I realized that Tor talk basically covers the whole topic and has plenty of examples of encryption bans. Watch the Tor talk at the end.) There are few examples of "banning cryptography" outright, and it doesn't last very long in this modern age because it basically shuts down business on the Internet. The ones I know of are usually done by totalitarian regimes in the middle of civil unrest. In times a civil unrest, a government may assert their control over the Internet by partially or totally blocking encrypted traffic. That means SSL, ssh... anything using strong encryption. This cuts off a means of people communicating without fear of spying. For example, in Feburary 2012, Tor reported that Iran was selectively blocking SSL traffic which also had the effect of cutting off Tor, a privacy network. Plus any number of attempts to shut down or filter the Internet as part of the Arab Spring. This is often done through deep packet inspection, basically peeking at all the traffic going by and if you spot anything that looks encrypted you block it. This doesn't just happen. It requires a great amount of planning and design work to allow centralized control of packet routing and filtering. Even if it starts innocently enough, like stopping child pornography or terrorists, that very same system can be used to censor and track dissidents. Tor is a privacy network within a network that not only encrypts your traffic, but it prevents listeners from knowing where it came from. This can mean life or death in a totalitarian regime who might come after you just for connecting to a web site they don't like. Even using Tor can mark you as a suspect. Tor is in a cat and mouse game to look more and more like normal HTTPS traffic. This forces government filters who want to stop Tor to also hinter legitimate encrypted traffic. This causes businesses to be unhappy which exerts pressure on the government to stop fucking with the Internet. It's cutting off your nose to spite your face. For more examples, watch How Governments Have Tried To Block Tor. It's fascinating and very informative overview from about 2006 to 2012.
