According to this site: $URL$ PEAR should already be installed, just shy. A few vhosts config changes and you're off. Unless PHP has been compiled without PEAR, then no, its probably never going to work unless you reinstall it, or get your hosting provider to do so. 

POP3 is a protocol, Exchange is an MTA, which can deliver mail using many protocols, it defaults to MAPI for user mail retrieval, but you can enable IMAP and POP3 (and even X.400) And it includes a webmail interface. (Which allows mobiles/iphones & remote users to access email). The webmail interface (when configured) allows users with broken Outlook to stay productive anywhere in the world.. ;-) 

Checked, if you are running Ubuntu, then that should work. Debian uses additional values in /etc/default/sysstat 

...then say yes to the confirmation request - switch will reboot with no config information....no username/password/IPaddress etc etc. According to this thread on the dell forums, you will need: an RS-232 crossover cable 

Just because M$ annexed him.. doesn't sniff make him a sell-out.. Download: $URL$ Detail by Mark: $URL$ Matter of fact, anyone who has to use a MS system should have a copy of the Sysinternals Suite on hand: $URL$ 

Spot on!, $URL$ You just need to specify if you want to audit the Successful deletion, or the failure to delete, or both. Both shows lots of event logs, but is useful tracking down malicious users, or buggy utilities. Please note: Before setting up auditing for files and folders, you must enable object access auditing by defining auditing policy settings for the object access event category. If you do not enable object access auditing, you will receive an error message when you set up auditing for files and folders, and no files or folders will be audited. 

In Ubuntu, I have two ethernet interfaces eth1 and eth3 that I want to call "foo0" and "foo1", respectively. Basically, I want something like "ip link alias DEVICE SECONDNAME". Is there a way to do this without mucking in the kernel? 

II am working on a project where I need to create a virtual machine that acts like a home gateway, so I am looking for the firewall/NAT that is most flexible. My hope would be that I could give some configurations that would make the VM act like some of the gateways typically installed in homes and small offices. Has anyone tried this before? Which software might be best for this? I can use any OS, so it could be pf, pfSense, iptables, ipfw, ipfilter, or even something more obscure. Any clues are appreciated. 

I have a small Python-based server program that runs fine, but I want launched each time the server is rebooted. What is the least that I need to put into an /etc/init.d script to work? I only care about "stop" and "start" (and thus probably the trivial "restart"). 

If you want to expand beyond the Linux distro world yet still stay small-footprint, check out installing FreeBSD. It comes with Sendmail (general ugh, but good enough out of the box) as part of the base install. You didn't say how little your old computer has, but FreeBSD should run just fine on something as little as 64M. 

I host my FreeBSD image at Opus One ($URL$ They are a long-lived small ISP with a pretty impressive setup in their own facility. I had been on a pizza box with them for years, but have just transitioned to their VMware cloud. If you read Network World reviews, you'll know Joel Snyder's name. Highly recommended. 

Yeah, that is a very confusing question. I guess, if you had to do it, you could enable "audit logging" using the NTFS tools on your windows server for those XML files.. assuming the aspx script loads them directly.. if they are loaded remotely.. dunno. If they are loaded from the page, then the requests should appear in your IIS service logs. 

We had a problem like this on our PowerVault server, solution: monitor the interface for 24 hrs till we found what was causing it.. it turns out it was a remote backup job in Backup Exec, flooding the interface.. added a second NIC, set that for BEX, problem solved! Your problem is probably something else, you might just have to stop and start the netlogon service.. I don't know. Any information you can give on the actual problem would help us to help you though. btw, yes, you can login through a command line, however, it uses the same kerberos/ntlm auth as windows, so you won't be able to achieve what you may think you can. If there is a problem with the server, this still won't work. (and you need to drop ALL the connections to the server first, not just a single shared drive like below) eg: 

Profit? Can't figure out how to write the rules that would do this.. maybe you'll would have more luck. 

If you have ILO or similar, you should be able to attach a CD/DVD ROM remotely (works great btw) What OS was on the drive? This page: $URL$ Suggests formatting will help, else, there is a registry change that may help. (for vista, but they haven't changed much) 

I would like to automate the installation of FreeBSD 8.2 for a project I'm working on. I know the answer to every question in the standard installation, so even a script that just pushes keystrokes would be acceptable. All clues appreciated. FWIW, I tried this question on the FreeBSD fora ($URL$ but only got one response that didn't solve the problem. Maybe ServerFaulters will have more ideas. 

I have started a local Docker registry with and it works fine for pushing and pulling. In a script that is going to pull from this local registry, I want to first test whether the registry is up. Is there any good way to do this short of trying a pull and catching the "Error while pulling image..." error? 

On Ubuntu 10.04, I have a long Python program that prints a bunch of output; I run this under "nohup". However, it waits until the end to put all the text in nohup.out. When I run similar programs under FreeBSD, each line gets sent to nohup.out. Is there a Ubuntu setting I can set to get the output faster? 

I have a couple of VMs that cannot have guest additions installed, and I pause and resume them with days between. I normally forget to nudge NTP when I start up the VM. Is there a good way to tell ntp to be very aggressive in how often it should check for changes? 

In a lab setup, I want eth0 on a Ubuntu server box to get a DHCP address for talking to the outside world, and I also want to assign it a static 10.x.y.z address for talking to other boxes on the local network that have 10.x.y.z addresses. I want to do this by editing /etc/network/interfaces. The man page for /etc/network/interfaces is modeled after "here's a bunch of examples, I hope you can figure out the actual rules on your own". I don't see a way to give one interface two addresses using two different methods (static and dhcp), and initial fumbling didn't produce useful results. 

Note, multiple RewriteCond directives are implicitly AND'd, you need to specify if they should be OR'd instead. If you want the browser to remember the redirection, specifying a permanent redirection might save some future processing. Depending on your config, it might be easier to specify the Known Good ranges and redirect for everyone else. From the rewrite manual on redirecting foreigners: Apache Manual 

We have an offsite hosted email server, which works (but is slow), and all our users connect to it to receive email. Internal users connect to my postfix server to send email, I want to leave that there and create a new email server that can act as a inbound relay (Not sure if that is the correct term) so that internal users can connect to it instead of the remote one: 

Which "previous question" would that be? I assume when you connect your 3G device, it automatically overrides your default gateway, which you can check by using the command line and typing: 

Then configure the server to determine whether to modify the header or not based on destination domain: 

Depends, do you want an externally hosted certificate? (Free from here: $URL$ How to use: $URL$ Or an internally created one? Free: $URL$ Once you have OWA using HTTPS, you can start using RPC over HTTPS. (If you have turned it on in Exchange of course, your question seemed to be about the certificate) 

If complicated "Hairpin_NAT" isn't your scene, solution for the lazy: simply add a static DNS entry in the MT device that points to the local server.. sorted. All local requests get correctly resolved, bypassing the router, all external stuff ignores your DNS entry so goes the dstnat route. 

When booting into Linux, there are sometimes one or two lines that get quickly cleared. I think that some of them don't even appear in dmesg. If nothing else, I want to suppress the clear before the "login:" prompt. Is there a kernel command or sysctl that I can set to prevent this so I can read them on the console screen after booting? 

I need to set up an ESXi 5.1 box to run some pre-made VMs that will not run well under VMware Workstation. I have started testing this, but cannot figure out where the @#$% the control comes from other than vSphere Client, which runs only on Windows. I get strong hints that, at least under earlier versions of ESXi, you could do most of the necessary things (start and stop VMs, add files to the datastore, configure new VMs, and so on) from a command line. However, VMware's site is now so littered with related products, it is impossible to find whether this low-end scenario is supported. I would imagine that a lot of serverfaulters would rather not have some of their critical infrastucture running on Windows. Let us set up a hypervisor box, and we'll control it from SSH. If there is a guide for how to do this for ESXi 5.1, I'm not finding it. Clues appreciated. 

First-hand recommendation: Rootbsd.net. They are part of a larger Linux hosting house, but their FreeBSD expertise is quite high. I have had a few in-depth conversations with tech support, and always come away impressed. 

It was a faulty drive, check the physical box for failure lights, replace, wait for rebuild, should be good. 

Its called a "Mandatory Profile": $URL$ Apply whatever settings you want to the profile, rename the .dat to .man, then, when creating accounts in future (or modify existing), set the "Profile" field in the accounts properties to that profile's directory. (The link above shows how to set this path) 

Is on by default, and is designed to prevent dynamic pages from being cached. You can create an acl like the following: 

If you read the /etc/tripwire/twcfg.txt file, you might be forgiven for thinking you can just add your emailserver's details there.. however that doesn't work. One quick final step, might want to add your email address as an alias for root, so you get roots email! 

If you have configured it for IMAP, you will have to specify which folders get synchronised, so its possible you have folders that are not visible.. HTTPS is the best for Outlook. If you are comfortable (have the bandwidth) to download your entire mailbox again, simply delete your profile (control panel -> mail -> profiles) and start outlook again, it will revert to virgin outlook, and you will have to configure it, however, when you get to the "Exchange Server Settings" part, type in the ACTUAL internal dns name of the server, select the cached mode again, enter your username and then press More Settings. 

This has a helpful example: $URL$ Uses php to parse the fifo and shunts it to browser... then ajax to refresh 

This is a feature/bug of putty, not FreeBSD. putty always tells the other OS what its width and height are. You can show this easily by doing one of your truncating commands, then widen the putty screen. You can see that the lines were truncated. Now give the comand again: you will see more columns. In essence, what you are asking putty to do is to lie about the width of your window (giving a number larger than what it really is showing) and to wrap the longer lines intelligently. That will work fine for and and so on, and fail miserably for or any other full-screen editor. Such lying can also cause display of information that can be misinterpreted because of the wrapping. There may be a mode of putty that does this, but I could not find it. 

Is there a way to get all of BIND's startup messages to go into the log named in the config file? For example, in named.conf, I have: 

I am creating a test system that will be run by others. It will have some kernel mods, and some of the default software in /usr/bin will be replaced. Because of this, I want to prevent the users from doing "sudo apt-get update" or "sudo apt-get install". These systems will not have any valuable data, and will mostly be behind corporate firewalls, and thus it is safe to completely punt on security-based releases. FWIW, moving apt-* and dpkg* to /usr/dontusethese does not work because some other processes like (gag) MOTD updating relies on them being in /usr/bin and whine if they are not there.
