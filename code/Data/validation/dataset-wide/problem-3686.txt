No, you can't predict 5k race time from 400 meters timing, unless you decide to run at the same speed and are able to maintain it over the distance of 5k. You can sprint the whole of 400 meters, but for 5k you need strategy over pure speed. It requires stamina and periodic speeding and slowing down to have an edge over other participants when done at competitive level. They are 2 different categories. To judge your 5k run's timing, you need to run 5k. Even if you run 1-2 k and record the timing, it may not give the accurate estimate for 5k either. 

The idea of fitness and building muscles is to get strong and enhance every aspect of your life. Working out is a part of your day, not the only part of your day. That being said, it's absolutely fine to do other stuffs after your workout, but make sure your body gets enough energy and nutrients to recover and good rest afterwards. So, it's not counterproductive or a bad habit, but just something that's dependent on an individual's capability and necessity. 

First of all, welcome to fitness stackexchange.From your graph and explanation, it seems like your lifestyle and interests/motivation only permits you to do short training for specific period, and then go back to ground zero. Yes, initially, it may seem like it's all the same . You build up fitness up to a certain level after a certain period of time. This may be more or less same for you, but how it may apply to others, we can only tell after considering a few factors. 

The idea of weightlifting is to have balanced range of motion, and have equal distribution of the load. When you alter the balance, your body has to do extra work on any particular side to work through the imbalance. It's unsafe and could lead to injury. If you feel like any side of your body is weak, you need to work on both sides to get stronger. If left arm is weaker, do isolation exercises and you may add more reps, but curling with a barbel with more load on the left is not going to help. 

As you said you want to reduce fat, you need to focus on what you are eating first. Your energy expenditure should be more than your calorie intake. There's no specific guideline on what to do first. Also, there's no exercise to reduce belly fat. You need to have a overall reduction of your body fat. Regarding workout, you need to mix cardio and weight training in right proportion, to build mass and reduce fat. As you said you workout at home, I'd suggest going out for a run would be a good cardio, or skipping the rope. Carry on with your usual workout, but divide it into parts, and do one part per day, like arms on a day, chest on the other, legs on another day and accordingly, to give your muscles some recovery time to grow. 

It can, but I can't tell for sure it's causing the problem in your case, or the other part of your diet is. The fact is, different diet plans work differently on different people. You may be allergic or intolerant to certain components of your diet, or the supplement you are taking. You get yourself checked by a doctor if the issue persists. Why not to go off it for a few weeks, and see how it works? If you just want to look good, you don't need those, but that's just my opinion. 

Not always it means something. While your body is quite responsive and flushes out waste quite frequently, it also loses water and electrolytes. Make sure you hydrate yourself properly and regularly. If you have every seen Brock Lesnar workout, that guy loses around half a gallon to a gallon of workout during one session, but have we ever seen a fighter like him? Whether in the octagon, or in the ring, I have never seen a man close to 300lbs in weight move so swiftly. So, don't worry, you just need to keep yourself hydrated and the salt levels in your body maintained. 

.First of all, there's no specific formula. Running involved various factors when it comes to calorie consumption. Like, at what speed you are running, what's your weight and what's the wind resistance also the slope . There are other details, but if we keep in mind the above, you can get a rough estimate. Remember, those treadmills that give the results of your calorie expense after running, just do an estimate, it's not accurate. Your calorie expenditure could be anywhere between +/- 20% of what the results show. Having said that, you need to start from the amount of force your legs generate during impact on the ground. That multipled by distance you run, is the work done of calories burned. It's not that easy as the distance has to be liner. Physics says work = force X displacement, which means if you are running in a circle and end up at the same point, your displacement is 0 so work done is 0, correct? Doesn't make sense when you are so beat after running 20 rounds of the soccer ground. So for the sake of your ease, just keep it limited to the distance you cover. If you are running up the slope, your work done will be against gravity. Instead of distance, you need to consider the height you have reached above the point where you started and multiply it with your weight. That's the potential energy gained by your body, or calories lost. So, it will all give you a rough estimate, not anything absolute. Also, there are several factors like breathing, chemical reactions in your body that's not taken into account, because body burns calories when when you are at rest. So, I'd say it's complex and differes for every human. If you go by physics that I explained above, remember, that the margin of error would be around 20% or even higher. Note: Dont fall for scams that claim they can get the exact count of your body's calorie expenses. Those products are just to make money, and to trap people with limited knowledge about how the stuffs work. Wish you the best. 

First of all, you need to have break days. You are working out all 7 days a week, and that way your body doesn't get enough rest to recover. It's not any specific recovery, but the recovery of your system to prepare for the next workout. I know some people who workout all 7 days a week and are doing fine, but in your case, it's not the same are you feel drained out. Your sleeping hours seems okay, but what about sleeping pattern? Do you usually go to bed at a particular time? That also determines how you'd feel the next day. From your diet plan it seems like you are heavily focused on protein, to gain mass, but remember, muscles need fuel or calories. If you feel like you have gained enough of muscles, you need to feed them with sufficient amount of calories. So, you need to make sure you are including the right amount of cards in your diet. 

To answer your question regarding motivation, I'd say there isn't a definite way of getting motivated. Different people get motivated by different things. The fact is, motivation doesn't get you to your goal. Grounded efforts and habits do. Just like you brush your teeth everyday, while no one tells you to do so. You don't look for motivation for that or to take a shower. That's because they have become a part of your daily routine, they have turned into habits. Likewise, you need to transform the workout task into a habit. After that, you wouldn't look for motivation. I'm not saying there's something wrong in being motivated by something, but in most cases, motivation is temporary. Habits are permanent and they die hard. Do it till the point you feel like doing it. Regarding feeling exhausted and fatigued, there may be several reasons for that. First thing is your diet. You need to eat enough in order to sustain energy all day long and to get fully nourished. Keep drinking water regularly, to keep yourself hydrated. This is very important as we are made up of 70% water. You also need to get adequate sleep. When you sleep, your muscles undergo the repair work, so it's very important to have a good sleeping pattern. I'm no expert on protein drinks and energy drinks, so I can't advise on those. Now taking your workout pattern into consideration, 5 sets of bench press? The things to be considered are the rep/set, the weight you lift per set. Also, if you are doing it right with correct form, or just getting it done. If you ask me, 5 sets of press with an average of 10 reps for set, gives you 50 reps. That's good enough for a day. I usually lift heavy, so I never go beyond 3 sets of any exercise.
