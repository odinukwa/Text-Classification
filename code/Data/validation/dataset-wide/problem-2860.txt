EDIT : When one considers the class of all ordinals, compactification seems wholly inappropriate. Re-reading this post, I think that most of what I've said, after the initial mathematical statements, is waffle. Probably just a shameless excuse to squeeze in a pretty picture. The whole idea of closure is contrary to Cantor's formulation, as suggested by @Conifold 's comment below, even if it is well-defined from a topological point of view. 

This is McTaggart's contradiction - ( P(h) ∧ F(h) ) ∧ ¬( P(h) ∧ F(h) ). As McTaggart notes, this argument is not very convincing since an event cannot occur in both the past and future at the same time. It started off as future; became present; and then was past. But what are we saying here? We are compounding tenses. We are saying P(F(h)) - i.e., it was the case that the event will be a future event - and, F(P(h)) - i.e., it will be the case that the event was a past event. McTaggart then argues that this gives rise to the same contradiction that is outlined above. Again, we must attempt to eliminate this contradiction by compounding our tenses, but this attempt gives rise to the same contradiction. This is McTaggart's infinite regress - there is no escaping the contradiction. 

Jobermark's answer is very well considered. If I might add a few points : Historically, philosophers have often admired rational, logical thought over emotion. This may be an error. It is very difficult to disentangle the emotional and rational aspects of decision making. With respect to the general functioning of mind, it may be impossible to have one (rational thinking) without the other (emotion). The neuroscientist Antonia Damasio refers to this as "Descartes' error" and provides evidence that emotion is intrinsic to thinking and decision making. For example, people who have suffered frontal lobe damage become emotionally flat. However, they do not become super-rational decision makers; rather, they become unable to make up their mind at all. On a lighter note - another problem is that what may appear to be an illogical decision to one observer, may appear to be perfectly logical to the decision maker (or to another observer) - or vice-versa. [aside : We probably all have a family member who fits this bill.] 

The problem is that independence (and consistency) results are results from mathematical logic about ZF rather than results in ZF. Therefore, if the ZFer is going to only accept results proven in ZF then how can she even think in meta-theoretic terms of independence and consistency. Thus, the ZFer is forced to either accept the realist argument that the independence of GC implies its truth, or she must accept that God's divine declaration is meaningless. 

I believe that your argument is perfectly correct as formal (classical) logic. You wish to prove a disjunction A V B. You do it by assuming not(A) and concluding B. Your confusion is arising because you are assigning meaning to the statements A ( = r-> s ) and B ( = s -> r ). From a logical point of view, it does not matter if rain implies snow or snow implies rain. Indeed, both of those statements are obviously false in their common usage. 

There is a compelling argument that says, if the universe is infinite, then anything that can exist will both exist and occur infinitely often. What is meant by can exist is "has a non-zero probability" according the some probability measure. That fact that you and I exist necessarily means that we exist infinitely often in a infinite universe. The fact that I am typing this text in response to your question means that we would have this exchange infinitely often. Etc. This is obviously very unsettling. The principle is best explained using a coin-flipping analogy. When flipping a fair coin, the probability of flipping one-million heads in a row is very small, but it is non-zero. Given enough time, this event will occur. Once it has occured it must occur again since an infinite amount of time remains. In the context of your question, any finite volume of space can contain at most finitely many fundamental particles in various configurations. The fact that our galaxy exists means that it must exist infinitely many times in an infinite universe. Etc. Whether or not a planet exists where it rains jelly beans is not clear. 

One might argue naively as follows : An event is marked by change and therefore an event occurs in time. The interval of time an event occupies must be non-zero, for if no time passes then no change can occur. Therefore, events do not occur instantaneously. Similarly, events that depend on one another cannot occur simultaneously. It may also be worth mentioning that there is not commonly accepted philosophical definition of event. 

Where this text seems to have problems is the statement “we can claim that the axiomatic presentation of inconsistent multiplicity…”, since it is precisely the axiomatic formulation of set theory that eliminates the inconsistent multiplicities. While I am not an expert on set theory, it appears clear to me that the author, and by implication Badiou, have some fundamental misconceptions on the status of contemporary set theory. Brassier, on the other hand, seems to be a credible guy. One assumes that the “actuality” you refer to is the completed “totality” of an infinite collection. Anyway, this all has little to do with your original question concerning probabilities. I am guessing that the “possible worlds” referred to are those of the universe of set theory, in which case it is the transfinite arithmetic I have referenced my original answer would be the key (or so I believe). The only reference to probability in the linked paper (above) is in relation to Chaitin’s constant Ω, which “measures” the probability of an arbitrary (or random) program halting. This doesn’t have anything to do with set theory, at least not directly. I’m not sure if any of this will be of any help to you, but hopefully it will help clarify some of the terms. 

The method you are describing is not "proof by contradiction", it is called "proving the contrapositive" - expressed symbolically as ¬q ⇒ ¬p. This statement is logically equivalent to p ⇒ q. It is important to understand that both of these methods are concerned with proving the material implication p ⇒ q, not (repeat not) the truth of p or q, as you assume in your comments. How does this work? The statement p ⇒ q is true unless p can be true while q is false. [1] In the method of proving the contrapositive which you describe one proceeds by assuming q is false and show that this implies that p must be false. This means that we can never have p be true and q false, so one can conclude that p ⇒ q as per [1]. In the method of proof by contradiction one assumes that p ⇒ q is false, i.e. p true and q false (contrary to [1]) and show that this assumption leads to a contradiction, enabling us to conclude that we can never have p true and q false. This is equivalent to saying p ⇒ q since the only time a material implication is false is when it is possible to p true and q false. Your comments concerning these strategies assumes that we know that p ⇒ q is true and we then derive the truth values of p and q. This is not correct in either of the proof methods - by contradiction or by contraposition. The point of these methods is to prove the truth of p ⇒ q.
