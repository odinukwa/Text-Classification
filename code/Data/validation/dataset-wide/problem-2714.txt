An idea that Rand freely admits she didn't understand can hardly be regarded as central to Objectivism. Your write: 

Ayn Rand would say that the right thing to do is what is in your rational self interest: $URL$ Why would it not be in your rational self interest to steal or cheat or commit murder or waste your time by taking drugs or whatever if you can get away with it? First, you might imagine that you won't get caught but in reality there is no way you can make sure you won't be caught. You might be seen in the wrong place at the wrong time. You might inadvertently leave a record of something bad you did. To think that you can be sure you won't be caught is to imagine that you know everything about all technology or techniques that could be applied to catching you in any way. This is not a tenable position. Second, even if you don't get caught doing bad stuff makes you worse off. If you murder somebody you deprive yourself of an unknown stream of benefits that the person you killed might have produced. Also, that person presumably had some problem with what you were doing. The rational response to this objection would be to find a way to solve that problem. For example, if your victim was banging your wife and you got angry about this, there are ways to deal with that other than killing him. You might have decided that if you wife prefers him you would prefer not to deal with her and divorce her. You might decide that the institution of marriage is not much good and that you shouldn't hold your wife to her marital vows but you still want to associate with her in some way. You might have decided to ask you wife why she's having sex with somebody else and address her problem. There are many other possible options. In each case you would learn something and make your life better. If you kill him, even if you get away with it, you have deprived yourself of an opportunity to improve your life. 

Contrary to some of the comments given above, quantum theory does involve a theory of time. Time is often used as a parameter labeling the set of states of a quantum system, but this is problematic because time is measured using clocks which are physical systems. So quantum theory is incomplete without a theory of time and clocks. A quantum theory of clocks was proposed by Don Page and William Wootters in 1983 and has been improved since then: $URL$ The short version is that quantum mechanics implies the existence of other universes and any given time is a special cases in the set of universes universes that contains records of previous times but not future times. See the paper above and chapter 11 of "The Fabric of Reality" by David Deutsch. As such, all times exist. They don't go in and out of existence. This sounds somewhat like the b theory of time. 

The laws of physics seem to be set up in such a way that any finite physical system can be simulated by a universal quantum computer operating on a finite number of qubits. See for more details and references $URL$ The laws of physics would then consist of restrictions on the set of operations on those qubits that are instantiated by the real laws of physics. We don't know exactly what those restrictions are and it seems unlikely that all of them can be captured in restrictions on operations that just take place between the simplest kinds of particles. For example, the second law of thermodynamics is often said to apply to macroscopic systems where it is left unclear what macroscopic actually means. You can entangle two particles and increase their entropy and then disentangle them again, which would lead to a decrease in entropy. So there must be some explanation of what kinds of processes the second law restricts and why and it is not going to refer to the simplest possible kinds of interactions. For the same reason I doubt that the laws are directly encoded in the qubits, see section 2.10 of $URL$ 

Rand didn't say much about induction except that she didn't know how it works from the appendix to "Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology": 

The relevant question is not why people do follow police officers' instructions out of this or that motive, but why they should or should not do so. Since a police officer is supposed to enforce the law, let's assume that he actually wants to do that. The question then is what kinds of laws or constitutional regime should people be willing to follow? The answer is that provided laws are not set up in such a way as to prevent correction of errors in our institutions, you should follow them: $URL$ For example, if freedom of speech was revoked you would have the right to break that law since it would prevent people from criticising institutions. If the police are trying to enforce such a bad law then the only reason to go along with them is prudence, i.e. - because they might beat the shit out of you. Parenting is a different situation. In a country with millions of people you can't reasonably expect to be able to get unanimous consent to every law. It is possible for a parent and child to reach agreement when they have a dispute. This is a dispute between two people, both of whom want the child to acquire the knowledge necessary for the child to survive and thrive without the parent. The standard excuse for not resolving parenting disputes in that way is that children are irremediably ignorant. The same parents then go on to send their children to school, which is odd behaviour if the children really are irremediably ignorant. For more discussion of this issue see $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

You say you're totally inclined toward logical reasoning. I am sceptical of this claim. Any argument uses assumptions and rules by which those assumptions are used to get conclusions. The conclusion of an argument if the assumptions and the rules used to get that conclusion are correct. So the truth of the conclusion depends on the correctness of the rules and assumptions. At this point you have two options. (1) Try to prove the rules and assumptions, which leads to another similar problem, and so to infinite regress. (2) Give up on proving the rules and assumptions in which case your argument is a guess. Option (2) is the only one that can be implemented in reality, so all knowledge, including mathematical knowledge, consists of guesses controlled by criticism. There is a further problem. You use physical objects to model maths, like your fingers, your brain, computers etc. So your knowledge is exactly as secure as your knowledge of physics: it is all guessing controlled by criticism. Scientists who acknowledge that their ideas are guesses controlled by criticism, and who look for flaws in their ideas, are not cheating, they are acknowledging reality. Unless you start taking the same attitude to all of your knowledge, you are cheating and lying to yourself. For further explanation of the problems with trying to prove knowledge see "Realism and the aim of science" by Karl Popper, Chapter I, "On the sources of knowledge and of ignorance" by Popper in "Conjectures and Refutations" and "The Fabric of Reality" and "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch. 

Good moral ideas are universal. But I don't know what moral values you hold or whether they are any good so I can't say much about the applicability of your moral ideas. 

This kind of explanation doesn't make sense for a variety of reasons: I will give one example. Suppose that the conspirators say they hold idea X but are actually trying to implement idea Y. The conspiracy claims that the conspirators will always act on X in public, so all of their public actions can be explained by X. So the alleged conspiracy plays no role in explaining anything they do. It is important to be careful when applying this criticism. Some of the examples you give are conspiracy theories in the above sense, such as Nazis claiming that Jews rule the world in secret. Other examples may have variants that are not conspiracy theories. For example, some people described as global warming deniers think that people advocating cutting fossil fuels do so because they have a political bias in favour of tighter government control of the economy. Such a bias can arise by purely non-conspiratorial processes. For example, a person who does not think the government is good at solving problems may be less inclined to go into government funded scientific research organisations. So then many of the people at such organisations may be in favour of government intervention in the economy for any reason they can come up with. And they may be more inclined to positively review research that claims there is a problem that requires government intervention, such as the alleged necessity for governments to do stuff about global warming. For an example of such an argument see Judith Curry's blog post: $URL$ 

This is a bit of a misstatement. In quantum mechanics, an object exists in multiple versions, and different versions of the same object may be in different places. Those different versions of an object may sometimes interfere with one another in single particle interference experiments, see "The Fabric of Reality" by David Deutsch, Chapter 2. And there are other experiments that rule out explanations in which only a single version of a system exists.
