I am going to participate in a half marathon in the 1st week of July and 3/4 Ironman in the 2nd week of July. I am training 11 sessions a week. 8 sessions of swimming with lot of floor exercises before it. 3 sessions of running. Let us not bother about my cycling for now. Out of the 3 sessions of running, one is Interval training 

I have a very hard hamstring. I can stretch my hamstring to a good extent, i.e., touch the floor without bending the knees with my knuckles but not beyond that. At that stretch point, I feel a stone-hard hamstring. Is it normal? Should I stretch further to obtain a loose and flexible hamstring? Or is there something other than stretching, which I should do? I jog some 1.5 km per day and do floor exercise (stretching and strengthening all different muscles) before hitting the pool. I some 2.5 km per day after the jog session. Will this help loose hamstring? Please help... 

My coach tells me that I shouldn't eat before going for a swim session. But I feel hungry during the session. The routine I follow in the session is: 1 to 2 hours of Jogging and Floor exercises(own body weight or weight training). It mostly lies in the range of 90 mins. After which, we get down into the pool and swim for 90 mins to 120 mins. What shall I eat just before the session starts? How heavy shall I eat? I am expecting answers related to swimming as it is involved and that is the main workout in the session. 

Enjoy running Edit My understanding on heart rate and interval training: Resting heart rate is calculated by counting the pulse rate or heart rate after you lie down for half hour or so. Your maximum heart rate is approximately 220 - age. The difference between max and resting heart rate is taken as diff for further calculations. Generally long runs are run at a heart rate between 50 to 60% (resting heart rate + 50-60% of diff)comfortably. If the this percent is close to the max heart rate then the person will get tired soon. So the resting rate is to be reduced in order to reach greater speeds with ease, for long runs. For a normal man the resting heart rate is 72 bpm (beats per min). In order to reduce the resting heart rate, one does interval training, during which the heart rate is pushed close to the max heart rate (or held near the threshold limit for a long time) while sprinting (fast runs) and reduced to very low rate (as low as possible) during the resting period (or slow jog). This kind of subsequent peaking and reducing heart rate, results in lot of fat burning and over course of time reduces the resting heart rate. Thus the above method of intervals reduces resting heart rate and allows us to run fast for a long period of time (distance). 

I am practicing myself on the Total Immersion style of swimming, as I am practicing for long distance triathlon. After a lot of practice I am doing the 2 beat kicks with little difficulty. Can someone tell me the optimum angle the body (core) should turn during the raise of an arm? Sometimes I feel that I turn my core less and sometimes more. Please let me know if more detail is required on this question. 

Is there a correct way to breathe? No. If you are doing heavy compound movements such as the squats and deadlifts, the valsalva maneuver is used to ensure a tight core so that you protect your lower back and able to power through when doing the movements. With that said, even the valsalva maneuver has its pros and cons. As for running/jogging, I would go by a tempo of inhale for 2 seconds and and exhale for 3 seconds. Basically, its to control my breathing so that I don't land on my heels and so that I can keep an upright posture. With all this said, if you are doing any sort of movement, be it lifting weights or doing your cardio, there is no right or wrong method to breathing. 

Does weight gaining workout stunt growth? No. Improper form causes stunt growth. You are only 16, you are still growing, so stop worrying about your height. I agree with rrirower statement, that is your height is determined by your genetics. Now, as for a home workout, there are probably a lot of routines on the net. Here are a few to help. Buff Dudes Home Workout Routine Barstarzz Home Workout Routine Nerd Fitness Home Workout Routine With that said, I highly recommend doing some sort of strength training routine to build up your strength. Once you are satisfied with the weights you can lift, either continue doing the same strength training routine or your own split or doing a different strength / hypertrophy routine. 

You cannot spot reduce fat. Meaning no matter how much you train your legs, you will not burn off the fats in that region. Stick to eating less(caloric deficit), and continue training. 

Here are some methods on how to reduce them (if you are too concern about it) :- Reducing stretch mark With that said, I have a stretch mark on both of my biceps, where the right side is almost gone whereas the left side has slowly started to fade. And some on my left shoulder. 

To gain weight you need to eat more than you usually do (caloric surplus). Hence, first off, you need to calculate your TDEE. Add your TDEE + 500 calories and you will be in a caloric surplus. For your protein intake, 1g per pound of bodyweight should suffice, as for your fat intake, 0.5g ~ 0.6g per pound of bodyweight and fill up the rest with carbs, vitamins and minerals. Next pick either strength training :- Stronglift 5x5 ICF 5x5 SS (The Original Starting Strength Novice Program) Or some calisthenics :- Baristi Beginners Workout Buff Dude's Punisher Prison BW Workout ---> Can't do one arm push ups? Just do close grip / normal push ups ---> Can't do handstand press? Do pike push ups ---> Can't do L-Sits? Do planks or hanging leg raises, follow the set and seconds provided Fortress Beginners Routine ---> Can't do pull ups? Do a negative pull ups or incline pull ups ---> Can't do a pistol squat? Do your normal squats ---> Can't do handstand hold? Do pike push ups Lastly, you may want to play around with your calorie intake since most calculator provide a rough estimation. You should use a weighing scale and a mirror (taking pictures also helps) to gauge your progress. Don't expect a huge difference in just a few months. If you don't intend to track your macros, that is also fine so long you are eating more than usual. 

I have a new set of Resistance cord that I bought. Assuming that all brand resistance tubes are quite similar, what is the length of extension that I can give to it? Each cord is of 4 feet length. While doing a few exercise, I am required to pull it overhead(while standing), placing the cord under my feet and using both hands to pull. I am 5 feet 8 inches tall. I am afraid I will break the cord and injure myself while exercising. Hope this is not off-topic. 

Previously I had asked about carrying hand weights while running. Can we pull weights while running? Tie a rope to our hip and the weight. I am planning to run on the beach sand nearby. My question is, is there any use in doing this? Will I improve my speed or my strength or both? 

Recently I have been training hard for my marathons and I feel that it may not be enough to become a champion. So I came up with the idea of carrying weight while running. I have got 2 dumbbells each weighing just 4 lbs. Can I carry these on my hand and swing my arms normally, the way in which I do while jogging? Will this improve my strength and/or my speed? Also please tell me, what is the extent of weight that I can carry, if at all this idea is good? 

Now the 3rd session is what I am thinking about. Shall I make it a sprint training with spike shoes on? Will it work good? If yes what regime shall I follow? If not what should I do in that session? If required I can cut one swim session and make it a run session. Please comment if more info needed from my side. 

I want to swim 3000 m non-stop for an event coming up next month. I have got three different plans for training to that event, them coming from a great coach. Those plans are concentrating on the 20*100 m and 10*200 m Now my question is, for swimming that long distance (3 km), should I add a long distance in plan in my schedule. Like 2*1500 m or so? Ironmen and great swimmers out there, Please suggest. 

I have had this doubt for quiet some time now. The place where I live is quite hot & humid. So, I wear cotton briefs always, including while running. While I run the half marathons or while I go for long distance cyclings, my briefs really get wet. I have got used to this. But then I am going to run my first full marathon next month and then the subsequent month, my first full Ironman. I definitely can't use the cotton briefs for the long events. Now my questions is, is there any special briefs for these purpose or is it not required to wear briefs at all? 

A marathon is altogether different league when compared to a 10 km run. There are many things to consider... 

Please refer image for the cartilage I am talking about. On the outer side of my left leg I experience pain after running very long distance (marathon). My doctor said that this pain is common for endurance athletes. A year back I got this pain after I finished my first half marathon. After some good running practice, I didn't get this pain at all for half marathons. But then I am getting this pain for full marathons now. Is there any specific strengthening exercise that will address this issue? I think there will be many of you having or had the same issue, so can anyone -who overcame this- help me? Or will I just get used to this? 

Tips to improve frailty and an easily injured body? I presume going to the gym is out of the option after that accident involving the dumbbells. So lets start by doing some calisthenics. Here are some :- Baristi Workout Beginners Program Nerd Fitness Beginners Plan There is more out there then the ones I listed. However, once you are happy with your progress, you can choose to continue / change said routines or start doing strength training. If you intend on starting with strength training either from the start or after you are satisfied with the strength and muscle gain from the bodyweight workout, here are some of them : - Stronglift 5x5 Starting Strength (Original) Ice Cream Fitness 5x5 Do note that working out should not be a chore and takes time to progress. Also please eat more that usually do (caloric surplus). 

How do I go about it and what all compound exercises do I incorporate for each body part ? That is simple. Choose a full body strength routine, SL 5x5, ICF 5x5, SS, PPL and etc. With that said, please continue doing your squats, lunges, leg extension and etc. Keep training your legs. Don't worry, your legs will not get as huge as those Mr Olympia. 

With that said, if you really want to know more, you could try doing it to see if your body is capable of doing so. 

Fitness schedule to get in good shape? First off, I would like to say that is tons of information over the internet and this site itself when it comes to losing weights. Let start off with your free body routines. Here are some routine that can be found over the internet or decent enough for overweights/newbies to begin with:- Baristi Beginners Workout ---> Can't do pull ups? Do a negative pull ups or incline pull ups/inverted rows. ---> Can't do dips? Do bench dips (either with foot on the floor or on another bench) or more close grip / normal push ups. Buff Dude's Punisher Prison BW Workout ---> Can't do one arm push ups? Just do close grip / normal push ups ---> Can't do handstand press? Do pike push ups ---> Can't do L-Sits? Do planks or hanging leg raises, follow the set and seconds provided Fortress Beginners Routine ---> Can't do pull ups? Do a negative pull ups or incline pull ups ---> Can't do a pistol squat? Do your normal squats ---> Can't do handstand hold? Do pike push ups P.S Can't do regular push ups? Do knee push ups or wall push ups. Next, your diet:- First off, calculate your TDEE and subtract 200~500 calories(this is known caloric deficit). Next your protein intake should be 1g per lbs of bodyweight, where as your fat intake should be around 0.5 ~ 0.6g per lbs of bodyweight and the remaining can be used to fill up your carb intake, and your micronutrients(aka vitamins and minerals). However, this is also highly debatable since there is no right or wrong answers. By that, what I mean is that you need to adjust your calorie(if necessary) to ensure you are losing weight. What about resting times? Generally, I would aim for 30 seconds to a minutes rest depending on how I'm feeling. I don't advocate following a routines' resting time as some may need more rest time than others. Lastly, do note that it takes time to either build muscle or lose fat. Do not get disheartened when don't see any result in the next few days, weeks, months. Also, do you have any mobility issues? If so, do include in your original post.
