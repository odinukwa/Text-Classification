Mandatory Happiness. This non-metabolic equine has been thoroughly spanked. See TVTropes for a good discussion at Stepford Smiler and Getting Smilies Painted on Your Soul 

In short: 3D, immersive version of a mouse needed. How does it work? Call it whatever you want, Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, Augmented Reality. They're all slightly different, and yet they share the same immersive quality and the 3D feel (and perhaps make use of things such as redirected walking (where a 90 degree turn appears to turn you 80 degrees) and redirected touching (look it up, it's pretty cool). Now, what this nice immersive place is missing is a good mouse. Yes, the clicking, annoying thing that we use everyday, and what I inevitably go back to after trying and failing to do any sort of precise design work on a tablet with my short and stubby Trump-like fingers. It's what graduated us from consoles to using a 2D GUI. Now, all of my futureworld stories (past 2020 or so) just HAVE to feature AR (my favorite flavor of mixed-virtual world). Currently, I think most 3D design is done in CAD programs, with folks staring at 2d screens and clicking and typing away. Seems like we're missing something, doesn't it? Specifically, I want to have a 12 year old girl, let's call her Alice, summoning into existence from scratch (and a few libraries) an entire (populated) palace, with the environment half-listening to her (mouse-like-object)-given directions, half using deep neural nets to conjure up the rest based on these clues and Alice's past history in the environment. To review, I want my story to feature this 3D-virtuality-optimized-mouse-like-object(?) - I put object with a question mark because I am open to the idea of there being no physically interactive artifact, but something else altogether. It has to meet a few requirements: 

You could blow up (turn super?-nova) a nearby star you don't like. I hear that take a bit of energy. Likely beyond a Type II. Find a nearby inactive black hole, feed it some hapless dwarf and point the jet at the cloud. Iffy. Build giant megastructures to generate huge magnetic fields and direct the gas in a large area. Get overthrown in a rebellion by the overtaxed populace asking why you're spending their hard-earned Joules on acts of cosmic vandalism like setting molecular clouds on fire. They will banish you to the center of a molecular cloud. As a dense massive object, your (soon to be inanimate) body will slowly attract nearby gas molecules. Over time, your body will become the accretion center for a new star. 

Now, am I old-fashioned? In some ways, perhaps. I hold many views that are out of place, not all due to my nature. But you'll never notice them, unless I want you to do so. Why on Earth would I wear 18th century clothing? I may speak with a slight accent, but I am foreign, just like so many others. I may sometimes seem young for my age, but I do move from city to city every decade or two for a change of scenery, so not many people notice. As to my ability to drop my old ways and embrace the new, once you've done it twenty times or so, it gets easier. In fact, you get struck with a certain impatience and wanderlust once in place for too long... You'll see, if we come for you. 

Once life is confirmed to exist on other worlds, it could be considered a religious duty to spread the light of wonder to the alien heathens, or even if life is not found, colonization could be considered a religious imperative. 

True, but irrelevant because... Actually, before I start with the answer proper, the thing to understand is that consciousness as we are currently using the term is a naturally evolved process, i.e. generated haphazardly, on top of a Rube-Goldbergian chemical stratum ("life") where it is an ancillary process mostly concerned with boosting the evolutionary fitness of a set of DNA replicants. To rephrase this in English, the barely functional kludge that is our brain evolved to help propel human genes into the next generation. The fact that there is a self-aware stratum in there harboring illusions of control over the body is a mere accident brought about by the moderate improvement in evolutionary fitness and bounded in complexity by metabolic cost of running all those neurons. More to the point, if a super-human Artificial Intelligence would go about designing consciousness, they would never create something as inefficient as humans. So yes, from the perspective of human, flesh-based consciousness, at some point in the impossibly distant future (trillions or quadrillions of years down the line) the universe will literally become unable to sustain human life. But that doesn't much matter, see, because... The 23rd century will never arrive And no, by that I don't mean that we'll wipe ourselves out with nukes or some silly thing like that. No, I mean that by the end of this century most sentient processes will have been digitized, i.e. moved to a virtual world, running millions of times more efficiently than before, and subject to further exponential refinements in computing power. The more computing power (aka thinking) the more we can understand and make use of the subtleties of natural law, and the better we can make our processes, the faster we can run them and the more efficiently we can host them. Subjective time will accelerate for those uploaded. A minute might pass for them in a second of primary-world-time, then with refinements, a whole year, then a millenia, then perhaps whole eons can be lived in the space of a second. The 23rd century will never arrive. We'll probably run out of the universe before we run out of universe. 

After a major impact, there would be a vaporized silicate atmosphere that would persist for about 1000 years, and the crust would cool sufficiently for a water ocean to condense again within 1 million years. The Hadean age lasted for a longer time than that (hundreds of millions of years), but that's partially due to repeated impacts remelting the crust again and again, and also due to the high content of radioactive materials in the early Earth. These materials have decayed so would not be an issue in your case. 

I will generalize my answer to the game-theoretic problem we're trying to solve. The answer, unsurprisingly, is "it depends." The fundamental problem is one of comparing: 

You can definitely have continent-spanning empires with millions of subjects without writing. The most famous historical example are the Incas: 

Big giant ice ring around the world would do just fine. Real orbital rings decay over cosmic time, but it could be a crushed captured comet that recently disintegrated. 

Transhumanism is an emergent philosophical movement which says that humans can and should become more than human through technological enhancements. Contemporary transhumanism has mostly grown out of a white, male, affluent, American Internet culture, and its political perspective has generally been a militant version of the libertarianism typical of that culture. Nonetheless, as I'm cowriting this story with a friend, I see a transhumanist theocracy, still white, male, affluent, but also dogmatic, unwilling to share power with anyone, relentlessly and ruthlessly pursuing the goal of Transcendence (a version of Singularity) in its well-funded research Temples. Given the Libertarian bent of transhumanism today, is it possible/plausible to have a transhumanist Theocracy in the future? 

Most likely this is one of the hundreds of mission contingencies examined by the Planetary Space Agency before the ship was even designed, never mind sent out. Such a mission would likely cost hundreds of trillions of dollars by our current standards, so every possible outcome will have been carefully considered in advance given the expense. The core dump would have followed established protocol, and separation bolts would have had to be installed in advance. This makes it likely that an interceptor ship capable of matching the top cruising speed of the main mission is probably already in the docks, waiting for the contingency to be triggered. 

It depends on how far from the current production possibilities frontier this technology is. There are several possibilities, depending on the technology gap: 

Now, let us consider a few facts. Technology has enabled faster flow of peoples, but populations are correspondingly larger. Human lives are longer, but also more fast paced. Technological levels are unprecedentedly high, but that might make modern societies more fragile to disruption. The US has nuclear weapons, but also humanitarian drives that, say, the Romans lacked towards what they considered 'barbarians'. The United States is the strongest political entity in the world economically and has been in this position for what is over a century. The United States is the strongest political entity in the world militarily and has been in this position for almost 3/4 of a century now. The United States has a centuries long tradition of incorporating immigrants into its body politic and gaining their loyalty. The United States has been in existence for 2.4 centuries already. Given all that, how long can we expect the United States to last? If you think providing date-like timelines is too hard, I will also consider a discussion of the possible factors that will eventually bring down the Union as an acceptable answer. The question of how one defines the end of an empire/political entity might be relevant, so I'd hazard a soft definition including external conquest, civil war resulting in dissolution, loss of the imperial heartland or of the vast majority of its territory to other entities, or a combination of persistent and irreversible demographic, economic and military setbacks that render the entity irrelevant on the world stage. For instance, a Byzantine 'empire' restricted to an area of a city state was centuries past being effectively an empire. EDIT: After extended discussions in chat, for the purpose of this question, we'll restrict the definition of the end of the USA as failing to keep all of the following: 66% of its present territory AND (66% of its population OR at least 2.5% of the world's population), AND 66% of its current constitution, excepting future growth through the amendment process. Edit 2: I use the term "empire" to mean geographically large and well-populated political entities. This is hard to pin down exactly, but say at least 1% of the world's area and at least 1% of the world's population. 

Quick answer: No, even though the conditions you asked about were actually in place briefly. There was a time, when the universe (as we know it) was about 13-16 million years old, when it was far, far denser than it is now, when the CMB was in the temperature range of liquid water. The Universe was also mostly hydrogen and helium, with a sprinkling of lithium. Perhaps some really precocious stars formed, and blew up, enriching the local environment. This is possible: 

The Wold (Forest) is one vast, interconnected, possibly digital mind. The mind is primarily built of one cloned individual of a single plant species, but there are over a dozen 'helper' sub-minds and hundreds of symbiotic plants, fungi and insects that play a vital role it its optimal functioning. Now I'm undecided whether this vast network arose naturally, was built by 23rd century eco-fanatical AIs or by a human xenobiologist called Deidre Skye. I'm undecided whether it's a dark swamp or a bright and sprightly forest. I'm also undecided on the thinking speed: it could ponder things with Ent-like slowness or its thoughts could reverberate across the network in a millisecond. Regardless, I've hit a limitation that I need Worldbuilder support to overcome. Since the Forest will always be threatened by various plants and animals, it requires mobile minions to enforce its will. Ideally, these would range in size from insects to massive beasts, but I'm open to more restrictive solutions too. Now how would a sentient forest control and direct such a host of animals? Good answers would have: 

Strategic dilemmas The sad thing is that the cunning robots don't have to do anything. We'll do it ourselves, out of the fear that the other guy is going to do it first. Eurasia is afraid of Estasia, and Estasia is afraid of Eurasia. Both are afraid of Oceania, and Oceania is afraid of them both. There are three main reasons why they will do it: 

Space exploration is great and amazing, and I want my fictional US government to fund it to the tune of $1 trillion per year, instead of the (comparatively) meager \$17.5 billion it is getting now. But why? (Or why not, if you're feeling contrarian) What reason would there be for of all these resources to be spent on space when they can perhaps better help the poor and dispossessed (or, more likely, the rich and well-connected) here on Earth? Answers will be judged based on plausibility. What could persuade a large section of the US population that space exploration and/or colonization is important enough to spend twice as much on it as the US is currently spending on its formidable military? Alternatively, is there any way that annual trillion dollars could come from private, (for-profit?) sources? PS: I'm thinking present-day technology at the start of the super-spending spree. 

This requires some explanation. Think of (the heritable component of) IQ as a result of the interaction of a few thousand genes (or un-methylated genes manifested in protein cascade complexes) mostly recessive, or dependent on many parts that effectively act as if recessive if any step is missing. If the parents don't have enough pieces in common to maintain the cascades (F depends on E, E depends on D and C, D depends on B, C depends on A), the child loses IQ points. Mean reversion is a statistical truth, not a universal one: very rarely, very smart (160 IQ) parents will have even smarter children (new or highly effective IQ-boosting gene cascades activated) but that's a far-off tail-end distribution (maybe 1 in 50 children of very high IQ parents will exceed their parents). This can be in part alleviated by, from most to least effective
