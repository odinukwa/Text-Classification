Well here's the thing: You assume "universe" is both the physical universe and a simulation thereof at the same time. You have to pick one. For example, if you are in a simulation you really need to apply computer science, which is all finite with the exception of a Turing Machine. If you are in the "physical" universe, you have to solve the metaphysical question of why physical law is universal, which on it's face appears to imply a finite space. There isn't even the slightest reason to make physical law universal inside an engineered simulation, in fact this is what you imply. So basically you are discussing "physical law", which (from Contemporary Debates in the Philosophy of Science, 2004, Christopher Hitchcock, editor) section 0.2.3, where "law" implies regularity, which, again, is what you seek to undermine. There is no accepted evidence for non-regularity. 

Two comments on this are (1) that it does not identify any least advantaged individual but only a social group or class : ‘the least favoured members of society’ are the reference point. And (2) that it is that it is purely economic in its focus, centred on the least advantaged in respect of income and wealth. ▻ WHY ACCEPT THE DIFFERENCE PRINCIPLE ? The difference principle would be little worthy of discussion if it were merely an ad hoc principle jutting out of Rawls’ theory of justice. It needs defence if only on Rawls’ behalf. JEJ Altham explains the principle’s rationale neatly : 

Conifold's comment stimulates this idea, which in fairness he might not share. There are two issues here. Suppose you see a zebra. It is a phenomenon, something perceived or sensed. Now, you cannot perceive or sense anything without applying some concept or set of concepts to it. You might think you have seen a striped horse, a striped animal, a quadruped, a creature with hooves, something that canters or gallops. You cannot perceive (or think you perceive) anything without bringing it under some description : and descriptions are conceptual. If you see the zebra as a horse, you have used the concept, horse. This, I should say, is a human universal : no perception of phenomena without concepts. But the concepts we apply are usually and almost certainly, and possibly universally, culturally specific. A particular culture may not have the concept, hoof : it may regard what I call a hoof as a horn-like decoration or the zebra as a unicorn mysteriously missing its horn. These examples are light-weight but they illustrate the important point that different cultures or language groups can 'see the same thing' - what a photograph might represent - but apply quite different concepts to it and in this sense 'not see the same thing'. There is no paradox here. We just need to draw distinctions. Interesting question, btw. 

The answer,unfortunately is yes because although the "Scientific Method"is not anything religious, the crossover is the similarity between Scolasticism (in theology) and Academicism in institutions that should not be religious but should be devoted to scientific pursuit for the simple fact that the definition of Empiricism is in conflict with Academicism. REFERENCES: Hume, Acquinas, Plato but all from a critical examination of Empiricism, Scolasticism and Academicism (respectively). Any text in criticism of Western Philosophy should suffice. 

The rest frame of relativity is at rest by definition. More concretely the COBE experiment shows the earth's velocity relative to the visible universe as a whole taken as a rest frame beyond which no other larger frame is known. 

Why do leftists have a broad set of ideals and people on the right also a set of different ideals? Why, generally, do women like romance novels (words) in the same way that men like colorful magazines (pictures)? There are a lot of answers to those questions directly [try Google], but the philosophical point is knowing the context. If you want to write a book with mass appeal about science, you need to leave out the equations. [Forward to "A Brief History of Time"], but that's just marketing. What you want is to develop is a feeling for a balance of form, function and target audience, or, as Barnett Newmann put it: "Aesthetics is for the artist as Ornithology is for the birds." 

I agree with all the above. You probably don't need to read anything before you read Kierkegaard though I'd add two comments. The first is that Kierkegaard was intimately familiar with the Western tradition of philosophy from Plato to Hegel, so he is writing against a background and this isn't always apparent. The other comment is that Kierkegaard is completely against to the work of system-builders and for whatever reason really has it in for professors. He is particularly hard on assistant professors : 'There is nothing at all for assistant professors to do. The assistance of these gentlemen is needed here no more than than a maiden needs a barber to shave her beard and no more than a bald man needs a barber to ‘style’ his hair.' Probably it's fair to say that Kierkegaard's biography is more relevant to his philosophy than is usual with philosophers, so a biography such as Stephen Backhouse's 'Kierkegaard: A Single Life' might smooth your way in. I'll add a third comment, which concerns Kierkegaard's style. This style can be both wonderful and verbose & obscure. More important is that Kierkegaard - I can't resist the impression - does not want to be an easy read. There is nothing pretentious about this but he employs allusion, irony, humour, litotes, and pseudonymy, to perplex and nonplus the careless, gist-seeking or skip-and-dip reader. The attentive reader will come away from the text stimulated and enriched. 

A. P. French wrote in 1971 in his book "Newtonian Mechanics", page 317 and figure 9-4, that if you consider a gun firing particles analogous to photons at a barrier some distance away, that since the photon-like objects cannot be seen, there is the appearance that Newton's third law does not apply until it is absorbed by the barrier. Scientifically we say that photons have momentum, and we could measure it anywhere along the path from the gun to the barrier, however the issue is that a photon does not take a quantifiable state until such an absorption occurs. That is to say, it defers to the philosophical question of "Where are photons between emission and absorption?" (Which does not have a precise philosophical answer in the context of the double-slit experiment). 

If you'll bear with me, I'd like to address the question by first considering the conditions for forgiveness. The relevance will very quickly become apparent. ▻ CONDITIONS FOR FORGIVENESS When forgiveness is granted or recognised as appropriate there are usually three conditions in place : 

I recognise very well the problem you are facing. It was a huge problem for me when I began reading philosophy for a degree. I can only offer suggestions that may help, not a magic keep. To illustrate my parallel experience, it took me six weeks to read Richard Robinson's 'Plato's Earlier Dialectic'. I calculated that at that rate I would not cover more than a fraction of the required reading. I adopted two strategies : 1 Faced by a long text I would read it through quickly, not taking notes but just getting a sense of the topics covered. Even from this light reading I could tell that not everything in the book was equally important. The second reading, the close reading, was much easier because I knew what was coming. Also I knew the text did not need to be read throughout with equal minuteness. When I first, quick-read the 'Republic', for instance, it was obvious that on a philosophy course I was not going to face questions on the early education of the guardians or, fascinating though it is, the Myth of Er. It was clear that the central books, IV-VII, were where the tough philosophical problems were located. [I now read the 'Republic', all parts of it, for its endless suggestiveness but I am now a retired lecturer, not a desperate student !] 2 Books are terribly time-consuming. Some you have to familiarise yourself with but not all. I quickly discovered that articles were a lifeline. Two or three, or three to five, good articles will present you with a variety of viewpoints, all you need, and if of high quality they will give you sharply focused material that you can absorb and apply to impressive effect. Most books contain some or a lot of material that you don't need. This is seldom so with an article; and when it is so, the brevity of the article allows you quickly to spot it. 3 Make use of journal articles, many of which are online in most libraries. Also subscribe to a magazine or two : 'Philosophy Now' or 'The Philosophers' Magazine' but also a journal such as 'Philosophy' (issued by the Royal Institute of Philosophy) of higher intellectual stamp. That's all I can offer, I'm afraid. These methods worked for me. They could well help you as well. All best wishes to an aspirant philosopher !
