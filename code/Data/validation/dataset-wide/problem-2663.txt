Zeno famously stated a number of paradoxes of space, time & motion to argue for parmenides unity & changelessness of being. Infinite divisiblity of space & time seemed to be a commonly held view then (Aristotle distinguishes between infinite extent and infinite divisiblity), did anyone propose resolving his paradoxes by arguing against this? I'm thinking of how Epicurus gave his atoms, indivisible matter further structure of minima which he proposed as an indivisible extent. 

As I'm beginning to read the classical texts on political theory - Platos Republic & Rousseaus Social Contract I'm beginning to be aware of just how shaky my knowledge of European History is. On the grounds that one should have at least some facts at hand to mark & measure these philosophies against is it advisable to have a good understanding of European History; except that itself is a very broad discipline itself. But then again, in Platos time; it is more the Hellenic History that one should be acquainted with. And that covers a different geographical ground... Can one read Political Philosophy in a vacuum given that one is to some extent acquainted with some european history having been born & brought up in one? 

Now, the second sentence is telling us that moos are also yees; that is if something is a moo, then it is also a yee. This means you can substitute moo by yee in the first sentence. And when you do that, you get the following sentence: 

I don't see how. If a formal language can do as you suggest, describe anything and everything, then it must be able to describe natural languages. But in natural languages new words are being minted all the time to describe new ideas. For example, Software. This word can be read by someone in Shakespeares time, but would he be able to make any sense of the word? No, because the concept that is the referent of this word was not invented until the early 20C. Further the words in a Natural Language also have a nimbus of meanings that vary in both time & place - American English is different from British English, and from Chaucers English. The English spoken by a music-obsessed teen is different from that of an finance-obsessed adult. Also, any formal language must be interpreted by a mind - otherwise it remains merely a string of symbols without any meaning. This then gives scope for ambiguous or alternative readings. (A comparison here is with the non-standard interpretations of a formal theory/language, for example there is a non-standrad model of Peano Arithemetic). Finally, mathematics makes a study of formal languages, and under reasonable assumptions, given any formal language L there is a truth that cannot be proven by that formal language. This is the content of GÃ¶dels theorem. Of course this doesn't answer your question, which is - is there a formal language that can describe any problem. But, consider this problem: Describe the proof of this truth. If this is acceptable as a problem, then the formal language L cannot answer this problem. 

The assumptions that you start with shape the future of your thought. Different assumptions different futures. There isn't a neccessary single starting point. Your headline question talks about Science. In Greek antiquity science was done by natural philosophers. They didn't use the modern scientific method but at least supposed that the world was objective and rationally explicable as per your assumptions. When in the body of your question you say how to comprehend 'life, universe and the rest'. It is clear that you think that the scientific method is the only way to go. But plenty of philosophers have disputed this whether theologically inspired (Buddhist & Islamic Philosophy) or rationally inspired, for example the phyrronic skeptics. 

This goes even more so today when the Net & social media is prevalent. Vargas Lhosa has also written about this in his book, Notes on Culture. It's also satirised in EM Forsters short story, The Machine Stops. Knowledge is not knowledge until it is implanted within the soul and able to be called forth for right action at the right time. 

Hume showed that empirical reality can have no cause & effect. All that can be shown is that events happen together or do not. Now, of course this means that science is not possible. This prompted Kant to rescue science by rescuing causality. He did this by bringing in consciousness. We structure experience so that it takes place in space & time, and hence we impose causality. In Islamic Mu'tazilite theology Allah is causeless, since he is outside of time & space - so causality makes no sense. But then He is not an event. There are events in nature that are fundamentally random so have no precisely determined cause. For example an atom of radium decays at random. 

My impression as a science or a technology it takes only the legitimate economy (that is under the rule of Law) as its proper sphere. That there is a preponderance of studies on the legitimate economy may be simply due to its greater visibility, its obvious legitimacy, the enormous mass of data associated with it. But it seems to me that the illegitimate economy has an equal right to be called an economy. It has its own Law immanent in itself. Are there any studies that say how these two economic substances actually interact? Where one substance flows into the other (by seeking a weak point to puncture by violence or cunning)? Then is there then only one actual economic substance? 

Can one, then thus characterise Post-Modernity as a liminal phenomena? For the failure of grand-narratives or the master-signifier means continuity of tradition becomes uncertain (Arendt also notes this break in European Philosophy as dating from Nietzsche) but it seems that this designation can only be awarded in hindsight. 

Classical propositional logic is bivalent, that is its set of truth-values has cardinality 2 (True & False). Intuitionistic logic drops the law of the excluded middle; does it have the same set of truth-values? If not - then what is its set of truth-values and its cardinality? EDIT As Rostomyan points out below, Godel discovered that intuitionistic logic is not a n-valent logic, for any value of n; this prompted Gentzen to write to Godel to say, somewhat sardonically: 

I haven't read the book, so I can't say much more on it; but I expect that the argument will be similar to how visible light is only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and this is generally accepted; the next step is to note that all the modern theories of forces (apart from gravity) are couched in theoretical terms taken from Maxwell, Freeman Dyson quotes him as saying (reprinted in only the second volume of Nature): 

The short answer is no, Chomsky doesn't reject evolution; the longer answer goes like this: Chomsky is arguing that it doesn't give sufficient insight into the nature of a 'natural organ of language', the existence of which has been won, as admitted by Dennett in this review of his book by the biologist Maynard Smith, who also agrees with Dennett on this. Searle points out that Chomsky moved linguistics from a classificatory science to a structural one; that is all human languages have a deep structure that is universal; and this universal grammar is already innate to the mind - in other words the child's mind is not a tabula rasa (blank slate), on which language is inscribed; but already has a language native to it; which when exposed to a language environment - say Gaelic - gradually loses its generality and becomes specific; and it's specific character is Gaelic. Interestingly, Chomsky ties this to Descartes notion of Innate Ideas derived from Platos notion of *anamnesis in Meno); and is part of his, as Lieberman puts it in @Conifolds answer, rationalist epistemology; this he argues was an inspiration for Kants own epistemology. One can adopt in fact some of Kants language to make the case clearer: a transcendental argument for something, is for Kant one which derives the necessary conditions of making this something a possibility; here it is the possibility of language, in all it's many-mannered variety, and the condition for this - Chomsky argues - is an Inate Idea of language - his universal grammar - in the human mind. It's for this reason Chomsky is dismissive of Darwins Theory; he surely accepts its role in evolving this facility; but this in itself doesn't say very much; Chomsky argues that "it is hard to imagine" how such a faculty developed, compared to a birds wing; to which Smith suggests in attempting to make sense of this statement, that 

Sexism, like racism is structural; this doesn't mean that people can't like or dislike each other - Arendt uses the term discrimination for this, which is awkward as it now it generally refers to the first sense: banning women from competing in the Olympics is sexist; but just because you beat a woman in a race doesn't mean you're sexist. 

Its probably best to scope this question a little more widely: I'll take it to mean what books discusses physics along with philosophy in the wider sense: 

Marx was a marginal figure in the political scene in Europe - "he had been exiled from Germany, thrown out of Belgium and expelled from France" when he joined the First International - The International Workingmans Association; it was through this organisation that his ideas became visible. Here Marx became a political activist and he aligned himself with the political current that became Communism. 

Intuition is important in mathematics; unfortunately this does not come across in how mathematics is often presented, or taught. Counting - what could be simpler; and then you see the definition of Peano Arithmetic... Or then, the geometry of lines, spheres and cubes; and then you see the axioms of Euclidean or Lobachevskian Geometry... The axiomatic method is a tool of mathematics, but not to be identified with it - which unfortunately happens; it's rather like a novel being identified with the pen by which it was written. That said, as a tool, it's useful - why? Because it reduces the number of elements to look at, and clarifies the dependencies amongst them. 

One deduces from this that it isn't just Eastern Philosophy that is not ' respected' in the wider culture but philosophy per se. 

People who are sad may be sad for a reason; they might have lost their home or some other disaster might have happened; this is sadness that is anchored on a real life happening. However, a melancholic disposition was one of the four classical personality types. They tend to be more realistic than optimistic people. Today, melancholia has been medicalised and called depression. If someone is being scolded for good reason then being upset seems a reasonable response. If it's without good cause then being annoyed or irritated seems reasonable. Human beings are full of passions, we are emotional beings. A man or woman or child who expresses no emotions, who is affectless would be seen as strange and alien; we express our emotions, and so daily we express both joy and sadness, happiness and unhappiness. It's what makes us human. We commiserate or celebrate.
