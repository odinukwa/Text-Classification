Biological evolution has nothing to do with "survival of the fittest". The hallmark of Darwin, Wallace, et. al. was the removal of teleology from biology. "Social Darwinism" - whatever that may mean to you or to Spencer - is simply a way of looking at society and explaining social events teleologically (in terms of goals, purpose etc.). Note the difference between these two explanations: Teleological evolution: 1) plants photosynthesize in order to survive. Biological evolution: 1) this plant is photosynthesizing. 2) plant species which photosynthesize have an increased likelihood of survival as a species. Note that survival is still a factor, yet in the former case survival is a presumed goal and in the latter simply a result. As for "social Darwinism" you need to examine "fittest" - fittest according to whom? Thrassymachus? Simmons? Spencer? LaLane? You?? Similarly with "most competent" and "thrive" - it is not a question of morals, it is simply a matter of distinguishing what is true from what is "true to you". There is nothing "wrong" with "Social Darwinism" but there is also nothing true about it - only opinion to be either agreed or disagreed with like so much gossip. 

I may vote for a Presidential candidate because I think that their administrative policies and positions will better suit the country. This is a sufficient cause for me to vote, and, of my voting, but it is not necessary, nor is voting necessarily caused by my thnking such. Yes, neurons are involved in brain activity but is a thought as you describe? Do you mean "thought" strictly in terms of propositional (linguistic) and sense (visual - why not sound, taste, smell, touch?) content such that may be expressed to any other similarly structured and intentionalistic biological form? Do you mean "thought" to describe all of consciousness or only something like "a proposition with a sense" (pace Wittgenstein)? By "appearance of thought" do you mean consciously conscious consciousness or awareness of awareness? The language we use and how we use it will sometimes lead us astray. 

No, not contradictory, but in the words of A.J. Ayer to Bryan Magee, "nearly all of it was false." (From the show "Men of Ideas, episode six: "Logical Positivism and its Legacy") 

I.e. "G is B. All B are D. D is G." draws a false conclusion. Hopefully by now, it the sound argument and true conclusion from this example of two premises which share one term should be plain: 

While lecturing about DesCartes' thoughts regarding the pineal gland (where the "soul" is attached to the body) Professor Searle mentions a similar line of thinking in the work of neurophysiologist and philosopher Sir John "Jack" Eccles. In the lecture, Searle goes on to say that he and Eccles debated each other and that the debate was televised in Britain. Does anyone know of the program ("Voices"?), the existence of a copy or a transcript? So far the following is all I have discovered in reference to the debate: 

It is likely tho enough to appreciate the differences one may encounter from alternative translations. For example: 

Putatively attributable to Aristotle (or one of his pupils) the term comes to us from their idea of household management. In this sense, all economics can be said to be home economics (inasmuch as the world is our home.) The purpose of studying the ways and means of managing such a home can be as trivial as studying for the sake of studying. Unstudied, however, it is arguable that the home would not be as hospitable. In the sense of "wealth and resources of a country" the purpose of economics is in the application of knowledge obtained by studying the production, consumption and distribution of wealth to such concerns of State as policy, taxation, welfare, et cetera. In this sense as well, survival is certainly a purpose economics. As far as economics seeks to answer questions of how to best manage my home, it can be said to have an ethical purpose. As far as economics are used as a "science of wealth" it's function can be said to be in service of social engineering. That said, economics has no purpose - it has no agency. It is simple a field of study. Per "What is an Institution?" published in the Journal of Institutional Economics: 

The fallacy of ambiguity, or polysemy. This fallacy includes the fallacies of equivocation, conflation, composition and such as well as your case of mixing technical terminology and ordinary usage. Conflation can also be considered a continuum or equivocation fallacy, but in particular conflation is the merging of two different things. Ambiguity, being open to more than one interpretation, more accurately describes the general fallacy. Depending on the argument, the mis-use of technical jargon can also be an argument from false authority, or an example of a rhetorical device of "argumentum ad ignorantiam" which relies upon the audience's ignorance. Stating "gravity is just a theory" is not, however, an argument. An argument that 

You may also be thinking of the argument from authority or appeal to authority when the authority in question is not related to the argument at hand, e.g. the opinion of a c.e.o of a tech company may be authoritative in their field, but irrelevant to a heart surgeon performing a transplant. You may also be thinking of the argument from false authority, but in the case of military commands, if the authority is your superior, then their authority is not false. For example, argumentum ex cathedra, or, argument from the chair, i.e. the seat of authority, is a valid argument when the authority is valid such as a Papal decree or a judicial ruling. It's all well and good to "question authority" but to sincerely question authority, one has to be ready to listen to the answer from authority. 

It is noteworthy in the cases of Nagel, Whitney. Bayne and Chalmers that they do not distinguish "information" in the observer-relative sense which Claude Shannon uses from the sense which Searle identifies as first-person ontologically subjective and observer independent. 

As for their overlap, it depends on who is using the terms and how they are using them, so, yes, they can be synonymous but are not necessarily so. For a demonstration of the ways to use the term "materialism" as it relates to consciousness, watch this brief excerpt from a discussion between John Rogers Searle and Robert Lawrence Kuhn (transcription and emphasis my own): 

No. One of the features of sentences is that even given a limited set of letters and words, there is a limitless possibility of word combinations. 

Neither. Theology is study of deity & philosophy is love of wisdom (read: respect for obtaining knowledge). Note as well that the history of philosophy is not philosophy. While many philosophers may be theists, philosophy and theology are quite distinct - same as theology is distinct from theism. Also, respect for obtaining knowledge is not a prerequisite for any area of study as study may very well be solely for the purpose of confirming what is already purported, believed, presumed, etc. You might enjoy these works: "The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language" by Rudolf Carnap "The Elimination of Metaphysics" by A. J. Ayer Chapter 1 from: "Language, Truth and Logic" 

I wouldn't put too much time into interpreting his aphorisms, but Wittgenstein's perspective might shed some light on the subject for you. "As long as there continues to be a verb 'to be' that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to eat' and 'to drink', as long as we have the adjectives 'identical', 'true', 'false', 'possible', as long as we continue to talk of a river of time, of an expanse of space, etc. etc., people will keep stumbling over the same puzzling difficulties and find themselves staring at something which no explanation seems capable of clearing up. And what's more, this satisfies a longing for transcendence, because in so far as people think they see the 'limits of human understanding', they believe of course that they can see beyond these." - Ludwig Wittgenstein "Culture and Value", pg. 15e c.1931 

It is trivially (in the sense of the trivium) worth noting that the first example is axiomatic (the former self-evident by definition and the latter axiomatic) and the second empirical (the former brute and the latter institutional); and, that all four propositions are true. It is non-trivially worth noting by these examples that a supposition is not citing cause - whether physical or logical. The former does not cause the latter to be true in the way that the cold may cause someone to shiver. That the cold may cause someone to put on a sweater, however, we can see that the relationship which the supposition provides a minimal bound upon results in a rationally assessable, if not trivial, truth value. I will leave it to you to decide upon this most recent sense of "trivial". How then to cite proof that this rational assessment is reasoned by logic and not an imposed rationalizing of the psychopathological varietal? It is said that axiom is only true because we do not allow it to be otherwise, but is logic nothing more than dogma? Let us consider the following instead of the standard "if..., then..." expression. Here I offer a formulation of a supposition without the logical constants "if" and "then": "I suppose that because [since] the Earth is an oblate spheroid that when an object gets dropped mid-air it will fall to the ground." Note that this supposition does not correlate to cause tho the constituent propositions are true and the content they describe have causes. What of the speculative supposition then? Do not these kinds of statements presume uncertainty? Do they presume uncertainty even when certainty may be achieved (I am hesitant to say "obtained" as tho knowledge of the empirical and axiomatic may be obtained, knowledge is not a dissolutive salve for every skeptics every doubt.) Also, if enough to inspire doubt, is the mere form of supposition enough to convince of a falsity where there is otherwise a truth? These are not questions this investigation seeks to address conclusively, tho I do ask that they be considered inasmuch as the reader is unconvinced of the rationally assessable truth values of suppositional propositions of the form, "if a proposition, then an other proposition". At this point I think we've reached a limit of useful investigation by only considering the former and latter propositions when they are both individually true propositions. What of "if true, then false"? For example: 

Nope. "An epistemology" is a study of knowledge, and knowledge is empirical verification of what is (else how do you know what is?) Faith is a powerful psychological tool which may or may not have anything to do with the empirical verification of what is (the case, the world, states of affairs...) There is a vast epistemic difference between claiming, "I have faith that the sun will rise tomorrow" and, "I reason from observation a prediction of when the sun will rise above the horizon again." Where faith may contend with the imponderable, knowledge and the study of it are ponderable. That one has faith that exactly twelve angels dance on the head of a pin neither makes it the case, nor is verification of the case. Use of language to describe such conviction from faith is hermeneutical and the results of such endeavors nothing more than opinion to be either agreed or disagreed with. By contrast, epistemology is heuristic and the study of it actionable towards heuristic acumen, rationally assessing the truth value of propositions, and the advancement of knowledge claims. 

This comment by Jeremiah Bowden at the very least offers a curt explanation of its obscurity (page 10): 

The formal construction does not alter the content or the falsehood of the claim. Keep in mind that the claims are either true or false in addition to their status in the argument as either premise or conclusion. Also, an argument is technically neither true nor false, but how the conclusion is drawn is considered in terms of validity and soundness. If we put your restatement in the form of a syllogism, as I will demonstrate below, it is invalid, unsound and arguably not a syllogism at all because there is no third term: 

In some cases not true could be either false or nil, but mostly not true just means false. Truth is a condition of statements (utterances, propositions, sentences, and such - see chapter 9 of John R. Searle's "The Construction of Social Reality"). This condition is satisfied when utterance matches (fits, corresponds to...) what is (the case, the world, states of affairs, et cetera. The adjective "true" describes the satisfaction of this condition. "Not true" and the synonymous adjective "false" describe a state of affairs where this condition of utterance is unsatisfied (met, obtained...) "Not true" is also used in a sense which "false" is not commonly accepted to indicate a nil (or null) status regarding truth value. For example, the statement is neither true or false that "Ruebens is a better painter than Pollock" - simply a matter of agreement, or what is commonly described as "true to you" (or me, or us, or true to them). Such are matter of sentiment, opinion, poetic use of language and such. Note that the objects of this sentence (Ruenbens, Pollock, their paintings, and the utterers opinion of them) are non-fictional. I mention this to distinguish a sentence with only perspectival (or situational) truth value (not empirical or axiomatic truth value) from sentences which has no rationally assessable truth value, such as "colorless green ideas sleep furiously" or "god did it" or "Yay!" or "go away". This is to say that such sentences are not therefore falsehood, only that evaluating the truth condition is inadequate to the occaision of their utterance. Consider, even a sentence which is rationally assessable as true or false may in fact be uttered without concern for such an evaluation. For example, if I am in my shower while practicing French and reciting the sentence, "il pleut" it is not a comment upon microclimate conditions. If I enter a French cafe completely soaked from a sudden Summer rainstorm to which the patrons were unaware and upon receiving odd looks I motion upwards and utter, "il pleut!" then it is an explanation of my circumstance including a comment upon the weather which can be assessed a truth value (all the patrons need do is look outside and see that either it is still raining or that everything which was dry when they entered the cafe is now wet to empiricaly verify the state of affairs and render an accurate truth value to my utterance). In a specialized discourse, "truthy" and "falsey" have broader use of "not true" but only in the technical arena and not for empirical statements of the case. 

The teacher is not making a proposition to be verified as either right and wrong. With "if X, then Y" they are merely establishing a condition which can be either satisfied or unsatisfied. That the teacher may have foreknowledge that their student will fail is another matter altogether. In short, in the case of "if false, then false" the implication statement is true, not the constituent propositions. The resulting truth value of this particular logical condition is not a matter of empirically verifying the propositional truth values - it is simply the result of the logical construction. The statement "false implies false" is true and yet each falsehood is still false. "'False implies false' is true" is basically the same as stating "if false, then false" and even in the case of "if true, then true" the antecedent is not the cause of the consequents truth value - nor is the antecedent the cause of the implications truth value. The truth value of any implication statement is the result of the relationship of the constituent propositional truth values - not their propositional content. In the case of any such ⇒ construction, the propositional content of the constituent and statements are not related, except for the fact that they are arbitrarily positioned within an implication statement. This is the power of logic - in much the same way that the power of computers is their limitation as syntactical engines devoid of semantic content. The possible truth values of any implication statement is irrelevant of the propositional content of the constituent propositions. Rationally assessing the truth value of the propositional content and evaluating the logical relationships are two different endeavors. 

Policy: "employees shall promptly obey any lawful order given by a superior." Declaration: "all orders of a superior are lawful because they have been given by a superior." 

Like so many terms, "person" is ambiguous as to epistemic considerations (what we can say we know of any person) and ontological ones (what exists of any person). If a white canvas has a speck of blue upon it, then some might say it is still just a white canvas, others that it has changed completely... yet in either case, it is a canvas which reflects light. In short: same body - modified, enhanced or otherwise - and same history/trajectory, with a transitioned identity - legal, gender, status function(s) and such. So... No, they are still the same person (body, history and such as well the "now you see the real me"). Yes, of course they are a different person (gender identifier, legal status). Not to suggest that personhood is an unresolvable contradiction, yet there are aspects of identity which appear paradoxical (e.g. the ship of Theseus or the grandfather's axe). Personhood is a dynamic and fluid notion in some senses, and others, not so much (e.g. if you are homo sapiens sapiens and alive... you are a person, but, if you were a homo sapiens sapiens and are no longer alive... not so much.) 

And essentially what you are "understanding" is what is commonly accepted as Aristotle's writings. Not quite a "John Frum" experience, but it is worth pointing out that as well, the writings of Aristotle have been interpreted as well translated between Greek, Arabic, Latin and English.
