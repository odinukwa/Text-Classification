When doing a multi-pitch and you reach a belay station (the top of a pitch) you can choose between belaying the lead climber from the body (like you do e.g. indoors where you aren't doing multi-pitches) or from the belay station (anchor) itself. Can someone experienced please compare those types of belaying? What are pros and cons? What should be preferred in which situation? I know for example that you have to care if you are using a Tube (e.g. BD ATC Guide or Petzl Reverso) and you are going to belay from the body because the device will fail if the pull of the rope isn't coming from above. 

Yes, shoe size plays a role which is quite important. But for beginners I would suggest to think more about foot technique than caring about the best possible gear. For climbing shoe sizes I give the following simple hints: 

So they needed 6 weeks to get the gear for the high camps up the mountain, struggling with the weather, Sherpas, expedition leaders and the gear itself. Of course we can't compare nowadays expeditions to the old days and the expedition of Buhl was complicated but still I am asking myself 

My experience is quite low, e.g. I have no clue about knots and security. I think that I am quite well equipped already, although this might not be the most important to start with. From my point of view I am also quite fit. 

More infos and tests on specific pedometers are given on walking.com. I don't know if they compared to GPS data in the tests but I think GPS is always more accurate to measure your distance. These days you can find GPS watches so size/weight is not really a matter (but maybe the pricing). Before you asked this question I also had no clue about the accuracy but reading a bit on the topic I think I am not going to try one on the trails ;) 

The linked topic of @Eyal is a good starting point to get an idea what to expect on those kind of hut treks. I would recommend to get information from online trip reports like on the site you linked to. They already marked the different sections of the Via Alpina where you could pick out 5 sections/days. First of all you should get something to work with like the local maps from the Alpenverein (see this PDF for an overview what maps are available). To get some idea you can research online thanks to the land surveying office. You can zoom up to a scale of 1:10000. So even without sticking to some online trek reports and to Via Alpina or a similar trekking route, you are able to get a nice time outdoors. This is also nice if you are going to adjust trek sections for you. Maybe you aren't feeling that good one day? Or you arrive at the destination of a day-hike-section at noon and want to continue? Maybe you want to stay two nights at that location you like so much? So just get some nice maps and improvise. Regarding your questions, yes, hiking along a street isn't the way we want it. Also the very remote places aren't what most people like being outdoors (of course there are exceptions). But it's typical in the Alps that you have a ton of day-hike routes with possibilities to stay for a lunch or even over night. So I wouldn't book a room in a village and try to do trips from that base camp. I would just walk from hut to hut and don't sleep in small towns/villages at all. The paths and huts are interconnected pretty well. So you don't need to care about a super market too much - just eat at the hut. You will also get a sandwich for the day there. You should also pack some energy bars at the start of the trip. If you do a round-like-trip the way I would do it, you also don't have to worry about public transportation which isn't that favourable in backcountry. You just have to have some idea where to start and where to end so that you know there are bus stops there. Here the homepage of the Styria public transport and here the austrian federal railroad. You could also try to hitchhike like Eyal did on his trip. I never did this but why not, if it's not that remote like a forest road where only the forester is allowed to come by ;) By the way you could also call the guys from DAV (german alpine club) or OEAV (austrian alpine club) directly. For example the DAV has people helping for exactly that kind of questions. I am sure they will also help you in English. 

In general you can't do that much in two weeks, regardless being 20 or 80 years old. It depends on your general fitness level and your life habits. If you usually are a healthy living (wo)man, being active, eating balanced, no-drinker, no-smoker and so on, it will be easier to get a proper endurance level. On the other side I don't think you can achieve a lot quitting your vices for those 14 days. Like @Chris Mueller commented, quitting the smoking while you are are preparing for the trip could make a huge difference. If you are somehow fit I see good chances to achieve the hike without major problems. Again, I would recommend the same as for youngsters without regular sport activities while doing your preparations: stay active each day but don't over-exercise. I would make a difference as it is harder to regenerate in higher ages and for example I wouldn't recommend to go jogging. It is quite stressful for the body (joints) and you should avoid getting problems and have to quit your prep-training and also the tour itself. So I would stick to general (softer) endurance training in the aerobic region like cycling, swimming, stretching and breathing exercises, and of course doing some hikes. The most important is to listen to your body, doing breaks regularly, regenerate and drink a lot. You can't see this as a benchmark but often oldies are better in endurance sports like running than youngsters, but of course this needs years of training and an active lifestyle. Just had a quick search and found some interesting links, like training past 50 and how to increase stamina. Most importantly, try not to be overzealous while preparing and also during the tour. In my opinion for sport activities it should be most importantly about the fun! edit @user3196 Please give us a feedback how you prepared and if you were able to do the complete tour without major issues! 

Scandinavia is a good option, the more north you go the better. For me the nature there is more remote, more 'raw' compared to the Alps. So I would think it's comparable with Canada (although I've never been to those regions). If you can choose when to go, why not go during winter time. You can add late autumn and early spring too. In this timespan you could have a great time in the Alps. Either Austria or going 'deeper' that means moving more into the Western Alps. In Switzerland, France and Italy you can find the high mountains of Europe where you can hike a lot. During winter you can do really a lot of snowboarding. You find a lot of prepared tracks too. You need to know that the Alps are touristic developed pretty much that means you find a lot to do and especially lot of easy accessible activities to do. I wouldn't choose just by the days with snow. There is more than that. Think of culture, cities you wanna visit or in general what you are planning to see besides mountains (although I understand your point of view -_-) Here are some examples where to go if you are searching snow: $URL$ Even without translating it you can get an impression where they have a lot of snow. They give more ideas, like Kuusamo und Ruka in Finnland. It has a lot of snow but it's not very steep there. So more a cross-country skying paradise. 

I personally first realised that my left foot is bigger than the right one when I was starting to go climbing. Because never before I was using that tight kind of shoes. Keep that in mind. You will regularly see people getting out of their shoes as fast as possible after each climb. Simply because their feet hurt. I would suggest for the beginning to get some shoes which aren't that tight. Also to avoid enduring health problems. 

I don't think it is difficult to give an exact correlation between running time and hiking endurance. I think this is impossible. I will give you an example from myself: I am not a good runner because my lungs aren't the best. Nonetheless I can hike quite a lot and had no problems at 12.500 ft. Also 6000 ft a single day up/down were possible. Still I am getting problems when I have to run for an hour straight. This is just different stress for the body. I can't give you a reference for 12000 ft on 2 days, this will be tougher when you get a bit heavy-legged on the first day. But still, having the target of a wonderful summit in front of you will push you and will let you get over some pain more easily. Your mindset is very important here. Another point is the baggage or weight factor. I don't know what kind of tour this is and if you have to take food and water supply for 2 days and where you will sleep. Usually while doing mountaineering in the Alps you will get to pretty comfortable huts and therefore the weight on your back will be quite low. So the weight factor might not be of great importance. The oxygen factor might be very important but once again this will differ from human being to human being. This predisposition is very individual but like being said, giving your body the chance for proper acclimatization will help you really a lot! Coming some days before the tour starts, doing some moderate hikes and sleeping on 8000 to 10.000 ft give you a good chance that the 14.500 ft summit might not be recognized by your body directly. So it's possible that you aren't even getting a minor headache. Though, don't forget to drink, drink, drink. If you have some time until the tour starts, go for shorter hikes with similar equipment. One-day-trips will do it, just make sure you aren't over-exercising and exhausting your body too much because regeneration costs time and you will be weaker afterwards. You can increase your training tours slowly. 

What's most important here is to notice and decide, when you need compensation training for bouldering? 

to see that with decreasing density the Force decreases too. For the same velocity (u) the drag coefficient (Cd) is dependent of the bullet shape and will be constant, same as the frontal area of the bullet (A). To sum this up: The warmer and the more humid your air is, the lower the density and therefore the air resistance will be. And the lower the air resistance, the higher your bullet will hit. To know how strong these effects are we would need to use some additional maths and to be more exact we would need computational fluid dynamics like here or here or experiments ;) 

Rocker is a term common for freeride ski and snowboards. Because of the deep snow (powder) you need ski which are floating by design. That means it is easier to ride in powder with a higher rocker. Rocker technically means the negative preload the ski/snowboard are having. So if you lay them on the ground without any load, the ski only touches the ground in the middle (where your binding lies) and not over the whole surface. It seems that rockers also show advantages in halfpipes (freeskiing) and even on piste. So the technology is already widespread in winter sports.
