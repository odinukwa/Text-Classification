There's also a different way of writing down the $H$-space structure, that I like for its algebro-geometric flavor. (I'll talk about $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ here, and $\mathbb{R}P^\infty$ should be analogous.) Regarding $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ as a classifying space for complex line bundles, we know that this $H$-space structure is supposed to implement "tensor product of line bundles". In a (not very explicit) sense this tells us the homotopy class of $\mathbb{C}P^\infty \times \mathbb{C}P^\infty \to \mathbb{C}P^\infty$: It represents the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(1,1) = p_1^* \mathcal{O}(1) \otimes p_2^* \mathcal{O}(1)$. We can use this description to write down a much more explicit (and classical) explicit representative. First, let's recall what the analogous picture looks like for finite projective spaces. The line bundle $\mathcal{O}(1,1)$ determines (upon picking generating sections) the Segre map $\mathbb{C}P^n \times \mathbb{C}P^m \to \mathbb{C}P^{nm+n+m}$ which takes (in homogeneous coordinates) $([X_0:\ldots:X_n] , [Y_0:\ldots:Y_m]) \mapsto[X_0 Y_0: \ldots : X_i Y_j: \ldots: X_n Y_m]$ where I'm choosing to be vague on the precise ordering of the coordinates. (In the end this won't matter up to homotopy, as the maps will become homotopic upon composing with $\mathbb{C}P^{nm+n+m} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}P^\infty$.) The analogous formula with infinitely many homogeneous coordinate makes just as much sense, one just has to a good ordering of pairs of non-negative integers. Such an infinite Segre map gives another realization of the $H$-space structure. 

I'm a bit confused concerning tamely ramified covers of arithmetic schemes. I guess they would reduce to tamely ramified extensions of number fields, but they don't seem to do so. Let me elaborate: First of all, let me recall the standard definition of tamely ramified covers of arithmetic schemes (by which we mean connected, flat, regular schemes of finite type over a Dedekind domain, or $\mathbb{Z}$ if someone prefer this). Let $D$ be a divisor on $S$ of an arithmetic cover $X\to S=\mathrm{Spec}(A)$, where $A$ is a Dedekind domain. Then $X\to S$ is said to be tamely ramified along $D$ if $X\times_S (S\setminus D)\to (S\setminus D)$ is finite and étale and tamely ramified along $D$. Now, $X$ being connected and étale over $S\setminus D$ means that it is actually a $G:=\mathrm{Aut}_S(X)$-torsor (see Milne, Étale cohomology, page 40), that is, a Galois cover. Since being a $G$-torsor implies that $G$ acts freely and transitively on the fibers, the number of closed points in the fiber is equal to the order of the group $G$. But this means that the fibers all have the same number of points over $S\setminus D$. Ok, so far so good. Restricting to rings of integers in Galois number fields is where my problem begins. So, let $X=\mathrm{Spec}(\mathfrak{o}_L)\to S=\mathrm{Spec}(\mathfrak{o}_K)$ be a cover of the associated arithmetic schemes to $L/K$. In this case, a divisor $D$ is a $\mathit{finite}$ sum $\sum_\mathfrak{p} a_\mathfrak{p} \mathfrak{p}$, $a_i\in \mathbb{Z}$. So $X\to S$ being tamely ramified along $D$ means that $L/K$ is at most tamely ramified at the primes in $D$. Outside $D$, the primes can be unramified, inert and completely split (in $L$). $\mathit{However}$, the only possibility, comparing with tamely ramified coverings of arithmetic schemes is that $\mathfrak{p}\in S\setminus D$ is completely split, but there are infinitely many unramified and inert primes by the Cebotarev density theorem. What the heck am I missing? 

It sounds like you may want Exercise 9.7 in Hartshorne's "Residues and Duality". I paraphrase the statement: 

I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for (and there's a good chance you already know what I'm going to write) but let me give it a try: The realization functor of cyclic sets (not spaces!) to $S^1$-spaces can be made part of a Quillen equivalence for two of the three commonly desired model structures on $S^1$-spaces: The model structure that gives you "Spaces over $BS^1$" is given in a 1985 paper of Dwyer-Hopkins-Kan, while a model structure that gives you the equivalences that you want (i.e., checked on fixed sets for finite subgroups) is given in a 1995 paper "Strong homotopy theory of cyclic sets" by Jan Spalinksi. (Irrelevant to your question, but along the same lines: A recent paper of Andrew Blumberg describes how one can throw in some extra--still combinatorial--data and obtain a combinatorial model of the third desirable model structure on $S^1$-spaces, namely where equivalences are those that induce equivalences on fixed sets for all closed subgroups.) Spalinksi's model structure depends on the following construction of $|X_{.}|^{C_n}$ (as a space-over-$BS^1$) in terms of the subdivision construction: The simplicial set $(sd_r X)_n = X_{r(n+1)-1}$ has an action of $C_r$--since $C_r$ is a subgroup of the copy of $C_{r(n+1)}$ acting on $X_{r(n+1)-1}$; taking fixed points (in sSet) and then realizing gives $|X_{.}|^{C_n}$. This suggests (though I haven't checked too carefully) that remembering each $X_n$ as a $C_{n+1}$-space (in the sense you suggest, with subgroups) is enough, as you expected. 

I'm interested in covers of modular curves (especially cyclic covers) and I'm sure there's a lot of information out there available on this topic. However, I'm unable to locate any literature (on Google or MathSciNet). Anyone has any references? Edit: In response to the comment below, I'm particularly interested in the local properties of the cover. For example, how, if at all, Heegner points or supersingular points, translate into properties of the fibers over these points. 

I'm writing up a paper now where I'm the only author and have a stylistic question. Should I write ''I'' or ''we'' as in ''I/we recall the definition...'' etc. I think this simple example will make everyone understand what I'm talking about. Or should/can I mix? Is this too confusing. Or simply bad? Or ok? I feel that ''we'' is maybe a bit too formal and ''I'' gives the paper a certain personal cosy touch. But in certain respects ''we'' is more ''we go through this ordeal together you and I, dear reader'', where ordeal can mean anything in a whole spectrum of things. You know what I'm saying. So? 

The following is not strictly speaking something that can be read off from the character table. However, it is an elementary combinatorial identity about partitions which one can deduce from understanding the character theory of symmetric groups well enough, and looking at the character table does play a central role: For $\lambda \vdash n$ a partition of $n$ (i.e., $n = 1 \lambda_1 + 2 \lambda_2 + \cdots + n \lambda_n$) define $$ A(\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} n^{\lambda_n}, \qquad B(\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (\lambda_n)! $$ Claim: $$\prod_{\lambda \vdash n} A(\lambda) = \prod_{\lambda \vdash n} B(\lambda) $$ The character-theoretic proof proceeds as follows: 

I'm looking for examples of explicit actions of the infinitesimal group schemes $\alpha_{p^n}$ on schemes (maybe as simple as the affine plane) in characteristic $p$ or mixed characteristic, and their associated quotients. Tried googling but I couldn't find any explicit examples. Any such or references would be much appreciated. 

Since your interest is in deformation theory I would advise you to have a look at "Introduction to singularities and deformations" by Greul, Lossen and Shushtin. The first part of the book treats complex analytic geometry (complex space germs) and the second their deformation theory. There's also a survey paper by Palamodov "Deformations of complex spaces" in Encyclopedia of Mathematics (Springer) which treats some foundational material as well. Good luck! 

This is not a helpful answer to your main question, but merely a negative answer to your "In particular..what happens.." question. But, the general idea may be helpful in figuring out what more precise things (weaker than Keller's result) would be reasonable to ask for. $\newcommand{\RR}{\mathbb{R}}\newcommand{\RHom}{\mathrm{RHom}}\newcommand{\pt}{\mathrm{pt}}\DeclareMathOperator{\deg}{deg}\newcommand{\RGamma}{R\Gamma}\renewcommand{\mod}{\text{-mod}}\newcommand{\C}[1]{C^\bullet(#1)}$ Since I'll lapse into this notation anyway, let me make it explicit: Identity $\gamma_M$ with the functor $$ \RGamma(M, -)\colon D \to \C{M}\mod $$ where by $\mod$ I'm implicitly working in a dg-setting. At some point below, I'll assume that $N$ is compact oriented of dimensions $n$. (This is not strictly necessary, but allows me to avoid extra notation.) Claim: Suppose that $M$ is simply connected, $\dim M \geq 2$, and that $i \colon N \hookrightarrow M$ is not the identity. Then, the functor $\gamma_M \colon D= \langle \RR_M, i_* \RR_N \rangle \to D_{A_M}$ is not fully faithful. Fuzzy Remark: Before sketching an argument, here's a "philsophical" remark about why things will go wrong: The category $D_c(M)$ feels the topology (or maybe even geometry) of $M$. In particular, it has a Proper Base-change Theorem saying something like $q^* p_! = (p')_! (q')^*$ where the maps take part in a fiber-square of (actual) topological spaces. The category $D_{A_M} = \C{M}\mod$ feels only the homotopy theory of $M$. You should expect a Base-Change Theorem in this context, but now with a fiber-square of homotopy types -- more correctly, a homotopy fiber-square. A simpler sort of 'no go' result that this heuristic implies: Suppose you had wanted to include two sub-manifolds $i_k\colon N_k \hookrightarrow M$, $k=1,2$. The $\C{M}\mod$ images would be unable to tell them apart if the $i_k$ were homotopic -- e.g., the inclusion of any two points. While the constructible theory would certain care whether the two points were the same or not. Sketch of Claim: To see this, note that $$ \RHom_{D_c(M)}(i_* \RR_N, i_* \RR_N) = \RHom_{D_c(N)}(i^* i_* \RR_N, \RR_N) = \RHom_{D_c(N)}(\RR_N, \RR_N) = \C{N} $$ while Sub-Claim: Letting $\stackrel{h}\times_M$ denote the homotopy fiber product, $$ \RHom_{A_M}(\gamma_M(i_* \RR_N), \gamma_M(i_* \RR_N)) =\RHom_{\C{M}}\left(\C{N}, \C{N}\right) \approx C_{\bullet}\left(N \stackrel{h}\times_M N\right)[-n] $$ Assuming the sub-claim: to conclude it suffices to produce homology classes on $\Omega M$ in arbitrarily positive degrees, whose images under the composite $$ H(\Omega M) \to H_*(N \stackrel{h}\times_M N) \to H_*(\Omega (M/N)) $$ are non-zero. I think the following should do this upon filling in the details: Equip $M$ with a base-point in $N$, take some non-zero element of $\pi_i M$, with $i \geq 2$, that remains non-zero in $\pi_i (M/N)$. Use it to produce an $(i-1)$-homology class on $\Omega M$, and then take its Pontrjagin products. Sketch of sub-claim: Underlying the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence is the statement that, letting $\boxtimes$ denote derived co-tensor of co-modules over a co-algebra, $$ C_\bullet(N) \boxtimes_{C_\bullet(M)} C_\bullet(N) \approx C_\bullet(N \stackrel{h}\times_M N) $$ Poincare duality gives an equivalence $\C{N} \approx C_\bullet(N)[-n]$ of $\C{M}$-modules (or $C_\bullet(M)$-comodules). It remains to identify $$ \RHom_{\C{M}}(\C{N}, \C{N}) \approx C_\bullet(N) \boxtimes_{C_\bullet(M)} \C{N} $$ by term-wise identifying the co-simplicial cobar constructions on both sides. Example: Note that if $N = \pt$ the sub-claim is a familiar statement in Koszul duality: That for $M$ simply-connected $\RHom_{\C{M}}(\RR,\RR) \approx C_\bullet(\Omega M)$. In certain cases, e.g. $M = S^{2k+1}$, you can just see it. As an aside: $C_\bullet(\Omega M)\mod$ knows about all locally-constant things, not just local systems finitely-buildable from the trivial one. (But will run into the same issues if you try to include submanifolds without explicitly adding in extra generators for the strata.) Remark: Though $\gamma_M$ is not fully-faithful here, it does get the maps into/out of $\RR_M$ right. Logic as above shows that $$ \RHom_D(\RR_M, i_* \RR_N) = \C{N} = \RHom_{\C{M}}(\C{M}, \C{N}) $$ and then Verdier Duality (for $D_c(M)$) + something like Grothendieck Duality (for $\C{M}$) give the other direction as well. 

From the works of Borel and Quillen there is a connection between the $K$-theory of the ring of integers $\mathfrak{o}_K$ in a number field $K$ and the arithmetic of the number field. In fact, it is well known that 

It is well-known what the $p^n$-cyclotomic extensions (i.e., adjoining $p^n$-th roots of unity) of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ are (see Serre, Local fields for instance). However, assume now that $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is an arbitrary finite extension. What can now be said about the $p^n$-cyclotomic extensions of $K$? It is clear that this is a harder problem and I haven't been able to find any literature on this but I'm sure that it's out there. At least some cases (for instance, the case $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ unramified should be similar to the "classical case" I think). Edit: I should have specified what I mean by "What can be said...?". What I'm interested in in particular is the ramification groups and the jumps in the ramification filtration. /Daniel
