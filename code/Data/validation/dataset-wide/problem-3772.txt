Let me try an answer. Instead of working with $H^1(SL(2,{\bf Z}),V_k)$, I'll work with a space which is naturally isomorphic to it, but more concrete, the space of modular symbols $Symb(V_k)$, defined as $Hom(\Delta^0,V_k)^\Gamma$. Here, $\Delta^0$ is the abelian group of divisors of degree $0$ on the projective rational line $\mathbb P^1(\bf Q)$, and $\Gamma = SL_2(\bf Z)$ for shortness. The isomorphism between those two spaces is standard, follows from the long exact sequence of cohomology attached to the pair (Poincaré half-plane with cusps $P^1(\bf Q)$ attached, $P^1(\bf Q)$), and commute with the action of Hecke operator on both spaces, in particular, what matters to us, with the action of the "Hecke operator at $\infty$" $\iota$ defined by the matrix $\left( \begin{matrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1\end{matrix}\right)$ (a generator of $GL_2({\bf Z})/SL_2({\bf Z})$). Also I see $V_k$ as the dual of the space of polynomial in one variable z of degree $\leq k$, with the natural homographic action of $\Gamma$. That's equivalent to your definition as a $Sym^k$. Now we need to describe explicitly the relation you mention between modular forms and cohomology/modular symbols. Let us begin by cusp forms. In your post, the $\Gamma$-module $V_k$ is a complex vector space, but of course it is naturally defined over $\bf Z$, and I will call $V_k(\bf R)$ the version over $\bf R$. Let $S_{k+2}=S_{k+2}(\Gamma,\bf C)$ be the space of cusp forms. Then there is an injective $\bf R$-linear map $$S_{k+2} \rightarrow Symb(V_k({\bf R})),\ \ f \mapsto \phi_f,$$ where $\phi_f$ is the modular symbol defined by $$\phi_f(D)=(P \mapsto \Re( \int_D f(z) P(z) dz)).$$ Here, for $D=[a] - [b]$, $\int_D$ means the integral along any geodesic in the Poincaré half plane relying the cusp $a$ to the cusp $b$, for more general $D \in \Delta^0$, $\int_D$ is defined by linearity, and we see the right hand side is a linear form on the space of polynomials $P$ of degree $\leq k$ with real coefficients, hence an element of $V_k(\bf R)$ as it should be. Now if $f = \sum a_n q^n \in S_{k+2}$, let $f'=\sum \bar a_n q^n \in S_{k+2}$. The $\bf R$-linear involution $f \mapsto f'$ is of course the complex conjugation on $S_{k+2}$ associated with its canonical real structure given by the forms defined over $\bf R$ (= with real coefficients). Note that $\overline{f(z)} = \sum \bar a_n \overline{e^{2 i \pi n z}} = \sum \bar a_n e^{-2 i \pi n \bar z}=f'(-\bar z)$. If $D=[\infty]-[a] \in \Delta^0$, $a \in \bf Q$, one has $\iota(D)=[\infty]-[-a]$ one has: $$\Re \left( \int_D f(z) P(z) dz \right) = \Re \left( \int_0^\infty f(a+iy) P(a+iy) i dy \right) \\ = \Re \left( \overline{ \int_0^\infty f(a+iy) P(a+iy) i dy } \right) \\ = - \Re \left( \int_0^\infty f'(- a+iy) P(a-iy) i dy \right) \\ = -\Re \int_{\iota D} f'(z) P(-z) dz, $$ hence $$\phi_{f'} = - \iota (\phi(f)),$$ that is the $\iota$ involution on modular symbols corresponds to minus the complex conjugation on modular cusp forms. Now we complexify this real linear map, getting an injective map $$S_{k+2}(\Gamma,{\bf C}) \otimes_{\bf R} {\bf C} \hookrightarrow Symb(V_k({\bf C}),$$ where the left hand side can be identified with two copies of $S_{k+2}(\Gamma,{\bf C})$ and clearly from the above and easy linear algebra, one copy is identified with the $+1$-eigenspace, an other with $-1$ eigenspace for $\iota$ on the RHS. So this justifies your claim that the subspace invariant by $\iota$ in $Symb(V_k)$ contains one copy of the holomorphic modular cusp forms. There is also the question of Eisenstein series. Working in level 1 as you do, there is only one of them for each k, and the question if whether the modular symbol corresponding to it is of eigenvalue $+1$ or $-1$ for $\iota$. This implies unfortunately that to have it right we need to be very careful in choosing a consistent system of conventions, which is a little bit too hard for me. If I interpret correctly my own computations with Samit Dasgupta however in our paper THE p-ADIC L-FUNCTIONS OF EVIL EISENSTEIN SERIES (Prop. 2.6), to appear in compositio, I think this sign is +1, which would mean that the Eisenstein series is also in the invariant subspace of $Symb(V_k)$, in other words also appears in $H^1(GL_2({\bf Z}),V_k)$. but maybe I'm wrong. What makes you think the latter is constituted of only cuspidal nodular forms? 

No. GRH lies much deeper than the Ramanujan's conjecture for automorphic forms for $Gl_n$ (which of course is already pretty deep). For example, Langlands functoriality would imply Ramanujan's conjecture (by considering symmetric power of an automorphic form), but it is not expected to imply GRH. The analogy you observe between GRH and Ramanujan is real, but is nothing more than that: an analogy. For example, in the case of an algebraic automorphic form, then Ramanujan is closely related (and in many cases, is provably implied) by the Riemann Hypothesis for varieties over finite field, proved by Deligne. Hence the similarity of forms you notice between GRH and Ramanujan is the same as the similarity between GRH for variety over finite fields and GRH for Riemann. There is a strong analogy, but no one expects to deduce the case of Riemann simply from the known case proved by Deligne. 

You can determine the type of the representation by looking at the density of primes $p$ such that $a_p = 0$. If that density is $\geq 1/2$, then the form is dihedral, and the converse is true. In the case of density between $1/2$ and $5/8$, the set of $p$ contains the set of primes that are inert in a quadratic field $K$, and this means your form is CM or RM by $K$ (depending of whether $K$ is imaginary or real). In the rare cases the density is $>5/8$, it is actually $3/4$, and the projective image of the Galois representation $\rho$ is the group $\mathbb Z/2 \mathbb Z\times \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$, which is dihedral in three possible ways, and accordingly your form has CM by two imaginary fields and RM by a quadratic field (all three subfields of a bi-quadratic extension of the rationals). If the density is less than $1/2$ it is either $3/8$ or $1/4$, and your in one of the so-called exceptional cases. If $\rho$ is of type $A_4$, $S_4$, $A_5$ instead, the density will be $1/4$, $3/8$ and $1/4$, so you can use this to recognize the forms that have a $\rho$ octahedral or icosahedral from the ones that have a $\rho$ tetrahedral. How do you determine that density? It depends of what you want. If you're happy with guessing what type is your form, just count the coefficients $a_p$ non zero up to a certain $x$ with a computer and believe what it looks like. If you want something rigorous, you can use the error bound in the effective Chebotarev's density theorem, that will give you explcit values of $\epsilon(x)$ such that if the proportion of $p$ up to $x$ such that $a_p = 0$ is in an $\epsilon(x)$-range of $\geq 1/2$, $3/8$ or $1/4$, then the density is that number. 

I have made some sage computations for different values of $a$ ($a=2$ to $10$) and $C_a(n)$ seems to have a tendency to grow very slowly, though it is not clear if it is toward a finite limit or $+\infty$ -- or if the whole thing is just an artefact. My motivation is trying to understand (if only conjecturally), in the simplest case I can think of, what happens to the effective Chebotarev density theorem beyond the version I can find in the literature. I'll appreciate any answer, be it unconditional, based on a conjecture like GRH, or even purely heuristic. Comments (added on October 16th): I am interested in the question above for any integer $a$ but in my research a similar question arose with $a=8$. Actually I don't think the answer will really change of nature with $a$, so we can focus on the case $a=2$. In this case, the only number congruent to $1$ modulo $n$ between $1$ and $2n$ which is susceptible to be prime is $n+1$, hence $Q_2(n)=0$ if $n+1$ is not prime, while when $n+1$ is a prime $p$, $$Q_2(n)=\frac{\phi(p-1)}{\pi(2 (p-1))}.$$ By the way, this illustrates the fact that $Q_2(n)$ does not have a limit when $n \rightarrow \infty$: $0$ is obviously the inf.lim., but $+\infty$ is the sup.lim. : think on $n=p-1$ being for example the higher prime I'm a Sophie Germain's pair of prime, so that $\phi(n)=(p-1)/2-1$ and $Q_2(p-1) \sim \log p / 4$ which goes to inanity if one choses an infinite sequence of Germain's primes (which is widely expected to exist -- at this stage, I am perfectly happy to use any conjecture even if one can do otherwise). Back to the question, one has: $$C_2(n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{1 < p \leq n,\ p \ \rm prime} \frac{\phi(p-1)}{\pi(2p-2)}.$$ Note that since $Q_2(n)$ is non-negative, one can replace it by an equivalent, so $$C_2(n) \sim D_2(n) := \frac{1}{n} \sum_{1 < p \leq n,\ p \ \rm prime} \frac{\phi(p-1) \log(p)}{2p},$$ and the question begins to look like a complicated version of a question already asked several times on mathoverflow about the Cesaro average of Euler's $\phi(n)$, which behaves much more smoothly than $\phi(n)$ itself. Experimentally, here is what I get for $C_2(n)$ for $n=2^k$, $k$ running from $1$ to $23$: 0.750000000000000 0.500000000000000 0.300000000000000 0.254482323232323 0.204751427085986 0.182394996041895 0.174044947095252 0.177096489596196 0.177412757367371 0.175004984083009 0.175280949354989 0.176774240882088 0.177008402332853 0.178414103595542 0.178516411591865 0.179091173423042 0.179809089385918 0.180252447106263 0.180775697751659 0.181112338150868 0.181529153981739 0.181858564625316 0.182136158910456 To me it looks like $C_2(n)$ has a limit or perhaps goes to infinity a little bit slower than $\log n$, but I am really not well-trained in the difficult art of divination of limits of sequences from their first terms... What do you think? 

EDIT: I add some details. The proof of the stated results is easy. The representation satisfies, by Deligne-Serre, $tr \rho(Frob_p) = a_p$ for almost all $p$. The density of primes $p$ such that $a_p$ is $0$ is therefore, by Chebotarev's density theorem, the proportion of elements of trace $0$ in the subgroup $G:=$ Im $\rho$ of $GL_2(\mathbb C)$. Let $G'$ be the image of $G$ in $PGL_2(\mathbb C)$. An element $g$ of $G$ has trace $0$ if and only if $g$ has order $2$ in $G'$. We must therefore count the proportion of element of order $2$ in $G'$. For a group dihedral $D_{2n}$, this proportion is $1/2+1/(2n)$ if $n$ is even, $1/2$ if $n$ is odd. In $A_4$ there are $3$ elements of order $2$, giving a proportion of $3/12=1/4$. In $S_4$ the are $9$ elements of order $2$, so the proportion is $9/24=3/8$. In $A_5$ there are 15 elements of order $2$ (the products of two disjoint transpositions, which form a single conjugacy class), and the proportion $15/60$ is again $1/4$. That justifies most of the assertion of the first paragraph. To complete the second paragraph, you need a statement of Effective Chebotarev (initially due to Lagraias-Odlyzko), for which a very good reference is Serre's paper at IHES in 1981 (Quelques applications du théorème de densité de Chebotarev), available on numdam.org 

I understand well what an algorithm is and what a first-order sentence in arithmetic is. The difficult word in the quoted sentence is "truth". Here is my tentative interpretation. Define a "platonist" as someone who believes that natural integers actually exist and that first order sentences about them are either absolutely true or absolutely false. I am such a person. So for a platonist, the passage quoted above would mean: "there is no Turing machine that take a first-order sentence as input and produces the output TRUE or FALSE according to wether the sentence is absolutely true or absolutely false." Ok. The problem is that this interpretation makes sense only for a platonist. I am not going to name names here, but I know very good mathematicians that are not platonists in the above sense. 

For $G=Gl_n$, the $SL_2$ factor of Arthur plays a trivial role in the classification only when you restrict yourself to cuspidal automorphic representations. But Arthur is interested with more general automorphic representations that are in the discrete spectrum, that is (essentially) the irreducible sub-representation (in the naive sense, that is not the one that are in the continuous spectrum) of $L^2(G(\mathbb A)/G(\mathbb Q),\omega)$, where $\omega$ is a central character. For the classification of this, the $SL_2$ factor is absolutely necessary. In fact proving that the classification of the discrete spectrum of $GL_n$ is, modulo the classification of the cuspidal spectrum of $GL_n$, as pre diced by Arthur conjecture with his $SL_2$ factor is a monumental theorem of Langlands (prior to Arthur, who wa motivated by it to introduce its $SL_2$-factor), which has been rewritten with more details by Moeglin and Waldspurger in a large book with evocative sub-title "une paraphrase de l'Écriture"). This answers your question about $GL_n$. In general, it is still true, according to Arthur's formalism now proved in many cases, that the representations (or rather an $A$-packet of representations) that have an Arthur parameter which is trivial on the $SL_2$ factor are exactly the one which are tempered. To understand more about Arthur formalism, besides Arthus' articles which are very deep and very hard, and Frankel's survey you quote, you can give a look to the Appendix of my book with Chenevier, Astérisque 328, and also to the new book of Chenevier and Lannes, Chapter 8. 

I know that there are groups with two generators with unsolvable word problem but the condition that one generator is an involution seems to simplify the problem quite a bit... 

At a relatively late point in the course, I believe that the idea of descent should be explained, with two examples: Zariski-descent, or gluing, and faithfully flat descent. The latter should then be applied, for example to prove that some examples of functor of points are representable. 

Lemma: let $\rho: G \rightarrow Gl_n(\mathbb Q_p)$ be an absolutely irreducible representation, that we see as a complex irreducible representation by the choice of an embedding $\mathbb Q_p \rightarrow \mathbb C$. Let $K$ be its rationality field (the subfield of $\mathbb C$ generated by the $tr \rho(g))$, so that there exists a central simple algebra $D/K$ of rank $n^2$ such that $\rho$ comes from a "representation" $\tilde \rho: G \rightarrow D^\ast$. Then there is a place $\mathcal P$ of $K$ such that the completion $K_{\mathcal P}$ is $\mathbb Q_p$, and $D \otimes_K K_{\mathcal P} = M_n(K_{\mathcal P})$. Proof: Since $K$ is generated (as a field over $\mathbb Q$) by the $tr \rho(g)$, and the $tr \rho(g)$ are in $\mathbb Q_p$, one has $K \subset \mathbb Q_p$. Let us take for $\mathcal P$ the prime corresponding to the restriction of the standard absolute value on $\mathbb Q_p$ to $K$. Then clearly $K_{\mathcal P} = \mathbb Q_p$. Next $\tilde \rho$ defines a representation $\tilde \rho: G \rightarrow (D \otimes \mathbb Q_p)^\ast$, hence a representation of algebra $\tilde \rho : \mathbb Q_p[G] \rightarrow D \otimes \mathbb Q_p$, which is surjective by absolute irreducibility, and whose kernel is $\ker tr red (\tilde \rho)$ where $tr red \tilde \rho$ is the reduced trace of $\tilde \rho$, but as one sees by going up to $\mathbb C$, is also $tr \rho$. Now the same argument applied to $\rho$ itself gives also a surjective morphism $\mathbb Q_p \rightarrow M_n(\mathbb Q_p)$ with kernel $ker\ tr \rho$. Hence $M_n(\mathbb Q_p) \simeq D\otimes \mathbb Q_p$, QED. 

The answer is yes (and this is a classical result). A good reference with complete self-contained proofs is Bill Casselman's book ($URL$ cf Theorem 5.3.1 

I am stuck with an elementary-looking problem, which does not belong to my usual field of research so I eventually decided to ask it on MO. Let $S$ be a finite set of integers. For $P$ a subset of $S$, I note $$s_P = \sum_{s \in P} s$$ the sum of elements in $P$. I assume that $S$ satisfies the following property $$ (*) \ \ \ \ \ \ \forall P,Q \subset S, \ \ \ s_P=s_Q \Longrightarrow P=Q$$ In other words, $(*)$ means that the set $R=$ {$ s_P,\ P \subset S$} has maximal cardinality: $$ (*) \ \ \ \ \ \ |R| = 2^ {|S|}$$ (Is there a name for the property $(*)$? additively free maybe?) Now for $x \in [0,1]$ a real number, I consider the exponential sum $$f(x) = \prod_{s \in S} (1+e^{2 i \pi s x}) = \sum_{r \in R} e^{2 i \pi r x}.$$ (Seen as a function of $e^{2i \pi x}$ on the unit circle of $\mathbb C$, $f$ is the Fourier transform $\widehat{\chi_R}$ of the chatacteristic function $\chi_R$ of $R \subset \mathbb Z$.) I am interested in upper bounds for the $L^1$ norm of $f$, $$||f||_1 = \int _{x=0}^1 |f(x)| dx.$$ A very simple application of Cauchy-Schwartz gives $$||f||_1 < \sqrt{|R|} = \sqrt{2}^{|S|}$$ My question is: 

I am not sure I understand your question. Or rather, as I understand your question, you have already answered it. Well, you asked "what would we loose if we..." and you answered "Wiles' proof of FLT". Isn't that enough? We have developed more complicated theories for much less venerable questions! Admitting rhetorically that it isn't enough, one can develop your answer. If we want to restrict our consideration to representation that are a priori modular, we would loose not only Wiles' proof of FLT, but also Wiles and others's proof of the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture (and this one has nothing to do with the Frey's curve), so we would lose the corollary that L-functions of elliptic curves satisfy a functional equation and have an analytic extension... We would then not even be able to formulate the beautiful conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer! We would also loose that the symmetric powers of the representation attached to an elliptic curve are modular. So we would lose the Sato-Tate conjecture as well. In a word, we would loose all the Galois representations coming from algebraic geometry, because we don't know a priori that they are modular/automorphic. And the fact is that those representations contain a lot of deep arithmetic and geometric (if you believe to Tate's conjecture) information. Added: The above is about the fact that without talking of representations that are not modular/automorphic we would lose the ability even to formulate a theorem of the form "such and such representation is modular". Here's another, different, point. We also need Galois representations that are not modular, in order to prove things about representations that are modular. I am refereeing to all the arguments of p-adic families (Hida's family, eigencurve, eigenvarieties) who carry at each point a Galois representation which most of the time is not modular. but we need those point to give flesh to the eigenvariety whose "skeleton" is made of the modular ones. To give an early example of those techniques, Wiles proved that a Galois representation attached to an ordinary form is ordinary (a statement purely about modular galois representation) using Hida's families, hence non-modular representations. Nowadays those techniques are ubiquitous...
