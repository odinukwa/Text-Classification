Commercial banks do a lot of lending and borrowing among each other and that is a sign of healthy flow of money in economy. This is because inter-bank activities ensure that enough credit is available and banks are engaging in lending to businesses, individuals etc. However, sometimes such lending is not what the central bank thinks it should be. Commercial banks may be cautious in lending to public or even to each other. This can happen when there are not enough investment opportunities according to them or because of low market sentiments. Banks at such times play safe and would rather park their money in their central bank accounts in the form of excess reserves. In such situations, when central bank reduces its rates there is less incentive for banks to park their money with it as their could be some other opportunities which could be more profitable. Secondly, the banks would have cheaper credit which can be used to finance their assets, to give loans and in case they face shortage of cash, central bank window is there to help them. Thus, reduction of rates by central bank can have many transmission mechanisms. However, there is absolutely no guarantee that such transmissions will happen. This depends on how the commercial banks receive this. How market reacts to this. Transmissions may take months or even years to complete. Within this period, the economy itself might grow or slow down and hence, the actual effect of these rate cuts or hikes could be just opposite to what the central bank intended. Hence, it's a tricky, inexact science and central banks have to work in a lot of uncertainty. 

After the Chinese central bank removed the peg against USD, yuan appreciated but Chinese exports didn't seem to be affected. They are steadily increasing. How can this be explained ? 

Money supply accounts for all the 'money' in circulation in the economy and the money itself has many forms. However, in a nutshell we can understand it as the flow of all kinds of monetary assets in the economy (broad sense of money). The correlation of money supply with growth has been quite contentious. We just lost a very good central bank governor in India because of these differences in opinion. The direction of causality is not so clear. However, many of the researches have had some empirical conclusions that suggest that GDP granger causes money supply and the vice versa is not true. In short term though, it appears that an increase in money supply leads to higher economic activity (can be easily checked through standard IS-LM or AD-AS models). The long term effects are not so clear. Having said that the answer to the question is yes, there can be growth even with a reducing or stable money supply. Such a situation would lead to deflationary pressures and possible increase in the velocity of money (faster transactions) in the economy. I don't have any concrete example of this case when money supply is steadily shrinking and economic activity is still healthy and growing. This could be because money supply is usually affected heavily by central bank's tools. And central banks usually would not do this. But there are examples when money supply has remained more or less stable. Such as, U.K in 2013-14 and India in 2015-16(June). In fact in India, money supply slightly decreased during this period while economy overall was in a healthy state. 

When the government causes inflation through printing money, the individuals who saved their money in the bank are poorer. Is there a way to determine how different inflation rates impact the welfare of the economy? I tried answering this question myself using the production function, and, though I was able to come up with some conjectures, I was unable to come to a definite conclusion. 

In the real world, "price fixing" is very difficult to accomplish. In most industries, it would be very easy for a new seller to enter the market and offer their goods at the lower price, stealing the customers from the "price fixing" sellers. For these sectors of the economy, "price fixing" is not an option unless the "price fixing" sellers can convince/coerce any entering sellers to commit to the existing fixed price. Ordinarily, "price fixing" occurs in industries with either a monopoly or an oligopoly. In a monopoly, there is only one seller. So, they alone are able to dictate the price of the good or service. In an oligopoly, there are only a few sellers. These few sellers can easily conspire with each other to elevate the price. However, even then, there is always the danger that one of the sellers will eventually drop their prices and try to steal the consumers from the other sellers. 

Definitions in Mathematics The field of mathematics is much more than just the applications. In fact, the applications are a result of actual mathematics which comes in the form of proofs and theorems. For example, in ring theory, mathematicians needed to prove that for all values of . Below is the proof: 

With the hiring of women who were just as qualified (or, in some cases, less qualified) than men, we would not expect the economy to grow substantially, and we would not expect US GDP growth to outpace the world over that period. My Reasoning: In the early 1900s, women's rights became an important issue in the Western world. Women began entering the work-force during World War II in order to replace the men who had gone to the fronts. The wages of women, however, were much less than the wages paid to men (in some cases, it was only 60%). It was not until the 1960s that the women's rights movement, now called "feminism," began to gather momentum, and President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act of 1963. This supposedly allowed for wages to be set by the job and not influenced by the sex of the worker. While this law reduced the wage gap, the gap continued to exist and still exists today. Let us think about hiring employees with a wage gap from an employer standpoint. You have a vacancy in a particular position (with a wage of \$100 for men and \$80 for women) and have the option of hiring either a man or a woman. The man can do the job 90% well (meaning that his is only worth ). The woman, on the other hand, can do the job 80% well (meaning that a man of similar skill is only worth ). Therefore, the man is worth of his salary, and the woman is worth of her salary. Thus, the woman gets hired even though she is less qualified than the man (which is the contradiction to your premise). 

That won't really happen in reality. A sales promotion which runs losses, as in your example, will not mean that the gross value added is negative. The final selling price of the item is the gross value added and that will not typically be negative. So, if an item is sold for 5 dollars then the gross value added is 5 dollars only. No matter if someone in the value chain made losses. So, gross value added will never be negative unless and until the final selling price of something is negative. 

Nash Equilibrium (N.E) is a general solution concept in Game Theory. N.E is a state of game when any player does not want to deviate from the strategy she is playing because she cannot do so profitably. So, no players wants to deviate from the strategy that they are playing given that others don't change their strategy. Thus, it is a mutually enforcing kind of strategy profile. 'Pareto optimality' is an efficiency concept. So no state will be Pareto Optimal if, at least one of the players can get more payoff without decreasing the payoff of any other player. There are many many examples of Nash Equilibria which are not pareto optimal. The most famous example could be the N.E in prisoner's dilemma. 

Price acts as a signal in markets. In a perfectly competitive market all firms face a horizontal demand that is fixed by the market and hence they have no control over the price of their good. It is market determined and no single firm can influence it. However, in an monopolistic market where there are many brands they have some control over their prices. Each brand can have a differentiating feature and certain level of loyalty. Imagine a firm whose brand is very strong, it can certainly charge a higher price. In fact informed buyers in general will expect strong brands to charge a higher price than others. Others might be offering cheap goods so and they will have their own market share. Hence the price change here is like a signalling event which can give information to buyers whether the goods are of good quality or substandard etc. Now, imagine a monopoly. In a perfect monopoly price will give no information. There is a single firm which produces goods and it can decide any quantity and price suiting it cost structure. A monopoly charging very high price doesn't mean it will offer high quality goods. 

The applications of this benefit many individuals when used to show , but this is merely the result of a more broad result that has been proven. How are these proofs constructed? Through definitions. To prove the above result, we could not assume that ; instead, we needed to use the definition of a "ring" which, by definition, allows for line (1). Similarly, we needed to use the definition of a "ring" in order to know that we were allowed to use in line (2). Definitions in Economics Economics, however, does not use definitions in the same capacity. Here, definitions are used strictly for the "defining of terms" rather than the "relation of terms." In Economics, one cannot prove that, in the short-run, expanding the money supply (which causes inflation) will decrease unemployment. The definitions in economics are not set up to do that; even more so, they cannot do that. Part of the reason that the definitions in economics cannot do this is because of the definitions. Think of the terms "good," "market," and "demand." All of these terms have sloppy definitions. They do not really relate to anything else. On the other hand, we have terms such as "currency" and "GDP" that have extensive, precise definitions. These definitions have been chosen purposefully, and measurements of "currency" and "GDP" are precise because of this. Another part of why Economics has "poor" definitions is due to the study of economics itself. Economics relies heavily on the demand of individuals. This demand cannot be quantified nor is there any guarantee that it will remain the same from one moment to the next. Thus, no real way to construct a proof that will be true beyond any particular moment. Because of this, economics does not need rigorous definitions. In Mathematics, however, we can construct proofs regardless of the numbers we use and, thus, transcend the limitations up to a very broad context. In the proof above, we used instead of a number so that we did not have to rely on using that number and only that number. By using , we know that multiplying any number by will give us . Response to Edesess Edesess is mostly (probably 95%) correct. In truth, most of the definitions of economics are not "precisely defined" to the same level that mathematical definitions are required to be. In Mathematics, the definitions are carefully considered and decided upon by the Mathematical Community as a whole (not to say that Economic definitions aren't, but that's outside my knowledge). Also, by the nature of Economics, the use of the definitions cannot be used to prove anything. In response to Edesess, however, economics should not be treated as Mathematics because of the fundamental differences in how they make discoveries. Economics is advanced through polls, market data, supply and demand graphs; Mathematics is furthered by research, proofs, and theorems. 

There is a sense of differentiation thus this is not competitive market clearly. Government regulations in an industry cannot be regarded as a monopoly as government mostly will decide on a price ceiling or floor and not the quantity of transport supplied. Since there are only 4 firms this is an oligopoly clearly. They can collude to restrict output and raise prices if it is within the limits set by government. Maybe the government has set the price to actually prevent collusion. 

No one knows. It is very easy to explain crises in hindsight but to predict one is almost unpredictable. It is a very bold statement that I am making but it is true. It is almost impossible to predict and prevent crises. The system is not designed to do that. Economists try to design the system in such a way that it can tolerate crises not to prevent them. Former secretary Timothy Geithner mentions in an online lecture that the economic system is like a highway. You can put a speed limit of 10 miles per hour then there would be no accidents but then it won't serve the purpose of its existence at all. You have to make the trade-off. Nevertheless, the safeguards that are put in place after the Global Financial Crisis are more stringent across the world. 

In usual open market operations, the central bank will create money, use this money to buy short term treasury securities from maybe banks, individuals, institutions in the open market. This creates more demand for these securities and hence their price goes up and yield goes down. This newly generated money goes into the banking system. With more money, banks have more cash and have more reserves. With more reserves banks may be more willing to lend to each other and to individuals also. This lowers the short term inter banking interest rate. This way, there is more money in the system and there is a downward pressure on rates. With short term treasuries, central bank is less exposed to the interest rate risk. In quantitative easing(Q.E), both the purpose and the mechanism are different. First of all, Q.E usually will be performed in a situation which is not 'typical' money supply shortage or economic activity slowdown. This will either happen in a crisis sort of situation where aggressive boost is required or when central bank has run out of its primary weapons may be it has hit the zero bound of interest rates. The central bank in these situations might buy securities of different kinds which can be long term treasuries, private securities, securities in a particular area of market which the central bank thinks, needs to be revived. This certainly will increase money into the system but not just that but to further lower the yield and ease out specific markets such as mortgage based securities by reducing the risk spread. One other criterion is the size of the increase in balance sheet of central bank. In Q.E there is usually a much larger change in the balance sheet of central bank. Also, as there are different kinds of securities (including long term securities) in the assets of central bank which are not necessarily treasuries or highly rated securities, the central bank itself is exposed to more risk. Ben Bernanke said in 2009 that, the Q.E they exercised was not pure Q.E but credit easing because in pure Q.E, the central bank will not discriminate between what securities it is buying. However, according to him, Fed did target few specific markets. According to him, targeting few specific markets is more like credit easing and not pure Q.E.
