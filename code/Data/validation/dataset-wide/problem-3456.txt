$f(L) = L^2$ exhibits increasing returns to scale. $f(L) = L$ exhibits constant returns to scale $f(L)= L^{\frac{1}{2}}$ exhibits decreasing returns to scale 

Here is a basic answer for anyone too uninterested to read the long answers: 1) ML focuses on prediction and not on causality (as does metrics) 2) ML is powerful for parameter selection and model validation 3) Many ML algs. are incredibly similar to basic metrics approaches. For example, ridge regressions and LASO are both just small extensions of OLS. 

So: $MRT_{x,y}=\frac{MC_x}{MC_y} \equiv \frac{P_x}{P_y} = MRS$ where I assume 1 holds so MRS is same for all agents. 

Now you have enough equations to solve, I think. Isolate either x or y using your budget constraint. To be concrete here, I will assume you isolate x. Take this representation of x and plug it in for x where you've equated your marginal utilities. This should allow you to solve for y in terms of exogenous factors. Take this representation of y and plug it back into $MU_x$. This gives both x and y in terms of exogenous factors. So, all you are doing is equating marginal utilities and also using the budget constraint to express the optimal bundle (optimal amounts of goods x,y) in terms of exogenous factors. 

However, when I take the optimal $\pi^e$ and substitute into (121) I get $$\pi^* = \frac{\pi^T[-1-\lambda]}{[-1-\lambda]} + \frac{\lambda k [ -1-\lambda]}{[-1-\lambda]} + \frac{\theta k [1+ \lambda]}{[-1-\lambda]} +e\frac{\lambda - \theta}{[-1-\lambda]}$$ and this simplifies to: $$\pi^*= \pi^T + k(\lambda - \theta) - e\frac{\lambda + \theta}{[1 + \lambda]}$$ And so my issue is that I don't see how there is no $\lambda$ in the numerator of the fraction multiplying e at the end of the simplification. Can anyone see my error? I must be missing something simple. 

$P=\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon +1} MC$ This is the markup rule for price-setting firms. Now, it is clear that a firm with monopoly power will never set $P=MC$. However, we can assume for now that the term involving epsilon is fixed for our firm with monopoly power. If this firm adopts technology that reduces costs, what do you think will happen to the marginal cost curve (in what direction does the marginal cost term move in the above equation)? Given the expected change in marginal cost, in what direction should price change? 

This condition will clearly coincide with the portion of the solution identifying the locus on internal P.O. allocations. Now, for the P.O. points along the right edge: 

Not my field but I think this is a basic overview. If there are mistakes, please let me know and I can edit. The monetary authority in the U.S. uses open-market purchases to manipulate a chosen policy instrument in an effort to effect macroeconomic aggregates. There is a general consensus now that the Fed's instrument is the effective federal funds rate, which is the weighted average of the rates at which banking institutions loan money to one another. So, monetary authorities use open market purchases in an effort to make this weighted average (the 'effective' rate) match their target rate. There is another rate that matters here - the discount rate. The discount rate is the cost that banking institutions face to borrow funds from the Fed's discount window (which is a separate instrument of monetary policy). And note that the discount rate is distinctly different from the FFR. This rate, historically, trends slightly higher than the FFR. The two rates above effectively allow the Fed to control the cost at which banks can borrow money. The first rate governs the cost of borrowing from other banking institutions. The second rate governs the cost of borrowing (for banks) from the Fed. 

If I understand you correctly, you are also curious about the interest paid on deposits held by the Fed. That is, the interest that banking institutions earn on deposits with the Fed. The Fed pays interest both on required reserves and on excess reserves. Interest on Required Reserves (IORR) - this rate is set by the board and is intended to offset the implicit tax that required reserves imposed on banks. Excess Reserves - The Fed began paying interest on excess reserves in 2008. According to Bernanke, this rate is another tool of policy that allows the Fed to set a floor on the overnight rate (synonymous with FFR). 

I want to show that the preferences represented here satisfy the three axioms [A1,A2,A3] that characterize expected utility. [order, continuity, and independence] Where $$E_{\pi} \mu = \sum_{z \in Z} u(z)\pi(z) $$ What I want to do is transform the given E.U.F. s.t.: $$U(\pi) = h + k....$$ $$U(\pi)= k...$$ Then by multiplying by $\frac{1}{k}$ and using $ln$ $$U(\pi) = \sum_{i=1}^n \pi_i ln(\alpha_i)$$ EDIT Perhaps this is actually the solution. Any feedback? This is not Homework. I am studying because I do not understand this well 

You know that you should have, at an optimal point, that the marginal utility of each of your two goods is equal and so you can use: $$MU_x=MU_y$$ You also have a budget constraint, yes? something like: $$x+y=P_x(initial endowment of x) + P_y(initial endowment of y) + Income$$ 

I need to know how to find robust S.E. for the CF approach to endogeneity. Consider the model: $$y_i=X_i\beta_1 + W_i\beta_2+\epsilon_i$$ Assume: $$E[X_i\epsilon_i]=0$$ $$E[W_i\epsilon_i] \neq 0$$ Thus, $W_i$ is endogenous. Now, let: $$E[Z_iW_i] \neq 0$$ $$E[Z_i\epsilon_i]=0$$ The control function approach: 

I am solving practice problems in Walsh. This is from 3rd edition page 87. Question 1. I have max: $$U=\sum\beta^iU(c_{t+i},\frac{M_{t+i}}{P_{t+i}})$$ s.t. $$\omega_t=f(k_{t-1})+(1-\delta)k_{t-1}+(1+r_{t-1})b_{t-1}+m_t$$ I use a value function: $$V(\omega_t,m_t)= max [U(c_{t},m_t)+\beta V(\omega_{t+1},m_{t+1})]$$ I then take F.O.C. w.r.t:$\space\space\space c_t,k_t,b_t,m_{t+1}$ My issue is when taking F.O.C. wrt $k_t$ I am getting $V_{\omega}(V_{\omega_{t+1}},m_{t+1})=\lambda_t$ but I should be getting my time subscript as t here instead of t+1. This is throwing off the next part of the question: Show that $$\ \frac{U_m(c_{t+1},m_{t+1})}{U_c(c_{t+1},m_{t+1})}=i_t$$ Proving this ^^^ is easily done by rearranging and substituting my FOC. However, I need to correct my FOC for $k_t$ before the solution actually works since I am equating: $$U_c(c_t,m_t)=V_{\omega}(\omega_t,m_t)$$ and $$U_m(c_t,m_t)=V_{m}(\omega_t,m_t)$$ to achieve my solution. For now, my time subscript issue with k is creating a time subscript issue with my solution. Can anyone help me with the time subscript issue? *****I can add more of my solution if necessary but it is just FOC. Also - I have solved the problem and checked against a solutions manual. I have done every other part correctly - just need to fix the time subscripts for k***** 

Foremost, I recommend you think carefully about the axioms of expected utility theory. In particular, think about the independence axiom. As a reminder, the independence axiom is as follows: Assuming that $X,Y,Z \in \mathbb{R}$ are lotteries and $p\in(0,1)$ is a generic probability: $$ X \succ Y, \implies pX + (1-p)Z \succ pY (1-p)Z$$ This axiom is most famously contradicted by the Allais Paradox. Khaneman and Tversky introduced Prospect Theory, which in very basic terms says that humans think differently about losses than they do gains. Further, they point out that people weight small and large gains/losses different when making decisions. They posit that economic man's value function is defined on deviations from a reference point, that this value function is concave for gains and convex for losses, and that this value function is steeper for losses that for gains. Graphically: 

In a nutshell, time inconsistency occurs whenever a policy maker can publicly commit to a certain policy action in a non-binding way. This is an issue in several settings (commitment vs. discretion settings and, as you see, policy coordination settings). You've run across the issue of time inconsistency in the context of policy coordination across interdependent economies. One can summarize the issue as follows: I promise in $t-1$ to deliver policy action A in period $t$ but instead deliver policy action B once we arrive in period $t$. Consider, as does the paper you cite here, a simple two-country model where the policy actions in a domestic country impact the loss function of the foreign economy and vice versa. Under certain first order conditions (laid out in the very paper you quote) there are obvious gains available to the policy makers of these nations if they are able to arrive at a coordinated equilibrium rather than the Nash equilibrium. However, in a dynamic game with no commitment device aside from reputational concerns it might be the case that one country will promise to play the coordinated equilibrium and then deviate unilaterally to the cheater equilibrium. As you can see, time inconsistency in this context means (literally) for one to be inconsistent over time with promised and realized policy actions. Further, see Luchonacho's references in his comment. Both links are quite helpful here and themselves could serve as an answer to your question. 

An overview of vouchers that is a bit outdated but a good place to start building an understanding of past work: $URL$ 

$$(\frac{r}{w} \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha})*K$$ $$\equiv (\frac{r}{w} \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha})[\frac{y}{a}(\frac{w}{r} \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha})^{1-\alpha}]$$ $$\equiv (\frac{r}{w} \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha})^{\alpha-1+1} \frac{y}{a}$$ $$\equiv (\frac{r}{w} \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha})^{\alpha} \frac{y}{a}$$ Is that what you're looking for? Just notice that between steps two and three, I inverted the part of K in parentheses and changed the exponent to account for the inversion. 

We need a way to mathematically model the consumption choices that an agent faces. To accomplish this, we use $\mathbb{R}^L_+$ to denote the agent's level of consumption of each of 1,2,..,L goods. Vectors tie into this because we want to think about how much of each good an agent chooses when optimizing over her preferences. So we don't just think about how much of good $i$ the agent wants. We want to think about how much of good 1 the agent wants, good $2$ he wants, etc. simultaneously. So, there are tons of different "mixes" of these goods that an agent can afford (that belong to this agent's budget set given some prices and wealth) and one of those "mixes" (vectors) represents how much of each of the L goods an agent chooses to consume when maximizing his or her representative utility. Now - Cartesian space. You should actually discuss the Cartesian coordinate system on Euclidean space. We use Cartesian coordinates to denote a point in Euclidean space. We could, for example, instead use polar coordinates to denote points in Euclidean space. A metric space is a bit more complicated but you can think of it (this is very simplified) as a space where the distance between any two points is well defined. The distances themselves are called a metric. Having a metric space allows us to use topological methods (for example, the concept of open balls when discussing the local non-satiation of preferences). The most common example of a metric space is three-dimensional Euclidean space. 

Dennis - as it stands, your question is not always possible to answer. At least, not in the way that I think is of interest to you. Specifically, restricting a consumer's choices to some finite, arbitrary set of choices, endowing that agent with some amount of wealth and then necessitating that the consumer purchase a certain amount of goods is not always feasible whenever those goods are discretized. Suppose some agent $i$ has wealth $w$ and faces choices between goods in the set $G \equiv$ {$g_1,...,g_n$} where we assume that we can innumerate over prices s.t. $p_{g1}<p_{g2}<...<p_{gn}$. If we suppose $w<p_{g1}$, then we can't satisfy any type of requirement that this agent must purchase some minimum amount of goods, whether we define the minimum over types or amounts of goods. This is just the most simple example of which I can think to illustrate a point. You could also think in terms of needing to fulfill some minimum requirement of $n$ goods. Further, we could have that agent $i$ faces $w-p(n-1)$ 

Returns to scale is a concept that we use to think about how output changes as we continually add more inputs. It does not matter if your production function takes one input or $N$ inputs. All that matters is how inputs behave within the function itself. Another way to think about this is to consider that a production function with a single input can exhibit decreasing, constant, or increasing returns to scale. For example: 

Suppose two countries. Let's call them A and B. Suppose, for simplicity, that the exchange rate between these two countries is 1. Further, suppose both countries have the same inflation rate and same nominal interest rate (and thus the same real interest rate). Now, suppose that country A, for whatever reason, triggers a contractionary monetary policy. The central bank of country A enacts this policy by selling securities in the open market. These securities sells cause a sharp increase in supply of securities. Given a relatively inelastic demand, this forces securities prices downs and yields up. That is to say - this action causes interest rates to rise. A rising interest rate is considered contractionary because it slows investment. So now we have two countries, A and B, with a 1:1 exchange rate but now country A has a higher real interest rate than does country B. Assume it cost nothing for people in country B to invest in securities in country A. We can reasonably expect people in country B, facing a 1:1 fixed exchange rate and no cost of moving capital, to buy Country A securities. Why? Because the securities in country A are more profitable because they offer a higher yield. That is to say - they are more profitable because of the higher prevailing interest rate in country A. So, contractionary policy in country A raised interest rates (to slow investment). This interest rate hike made securities in country A more profitable than they were before the interest rate hike. This increase in the profitability in the securities of country A induced investments from people in Country B. 

I solved this: note - I use $R$ to denote the binary relation as defined above. Completeness: I claim that this $R$ is not complete for $\alpha \neq \beta$. To illustrate, I use an extreme case. Let $\alpha \to 1$ and $\beta \to 0$ s.t. $f_{\alpha} \approx x_1$ and $f_{\beta} \approx x_2$ Now, let [x,y] $\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ s.t. $x_1 >> y_1$ and $x_2<<y_2$ Now: $f_{\alpha}(x) \approx x_1 >> y_1 \approx f_{\alpha}(y) $ and: $f_{\beta}(x) \approx x_2 << y_2 \approx f_{\beta}(y)$ so $f_{\alpha}(x) >> f_{\alpha}(y)$ but $f_{\beta}(x)<<f_\beta(y) $ I have used extreme case reasoning to demonstrate, WLOG, that anytime $\alpha \neq \beta \space \exists [x,y] \subset \mathbb{R}_+^2 s.t.$ neither $xRy$ or $yRx$ note_1 - The intuition here is very similar to a delta/epsilon proof. For any combination of alpha and beta (where the two are not equal) I can pick x,y so that the above proof always hold. note_2 - That the case of $\alpha = \beta$ is complete is trivial. I assume its inclusion here is not necessary. Transitivity: Let $[x,y,z] \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ s.t. $xRy, yRx$ I claim $xRz$ since $Xry$, $yRx$ and by the properties of $\mathbb{R}_+^2$ $$f_{\alpha}(x) \geq f_{\alpha}(y) \geq f_{\alpha}(z)$$ $$f_{\beta}(x) \geq f_{\beta}(y) \geq f_{\beta}(z)$$ $$\implies xRz$$ and $R$ is transitive. Continuity proven above so I will not repeat this part of the proof. 

HerrK. was correct in the comments. Sorry for the lapse. What is happening is that $U(x,y)=$max{$x,y$} with $P_x=P_y=P$ causes a consumer to be indifferent between consumption bundles: $(\frac{w}{P},0) \equiv(0,\frac{w}{p})$ Whenever you have unequal prices, say $P_x<P_y$ then the consumer will strictly prefer the cheaper good. Here, this means the consumer prefers the consumption bundle $(x,y) \equiv (\frac{w}{P},0)$ Perfect substitute functions are of the form $U(x,y)=aX+bY$,$x,y \in \mathbb{R^2_+}$ . Suppose $P_x=P_y=P$ then the consumer is indifferent between any mixing of the goods $x,y$ that exhausts his wealth $w$ (assuming the divisibility of goods etc.). If instead prices are unequal, the consumer will equate $MRS = \frac{MU_x}{MU_y}$. This can yield corner solutions that are similar to the optimal bundles chosen by the agent facing $U(x,y)=$max{$x,y$}. Specifically, whenever the budget line and indifference curves have different slopes. For example: 

So to actually answer your final question: You should probably be happy that oil prices are falling. Those techniques are expensive. If oil continues its downward plunge most of those marginal producers will have to exit the market. Something to consider is what this might mean over a longer time horizon. If many of these firms leave infrastructure in place (meaning there are relatively low barriers to re-entering the market), they could do a bit of hit-and-run until oil prices once again fall. This is assuming this situation arises while they are still incurring some fixed costs and are therefore seeking to minimize losses. Or perhaps it rises enough for them to even eek out a bit of profit etc. Perhaps not.
