If you are trying to deny access to your website to anyone but your VPN users, you could lock down your entire network from the outside world and only allow the VPN connection. Once your users connect to the VPN, they could access any internal websites you have running by either accessing them by IP address or url and validate their referring IP address either in code or by way of IIS to allow or disallow further access. 

We thought it was the windows advanced firewall, but it is turned completely off on the server. Then we thought it was our Sonicwall rules, but they are almost exactly the same as the existing one we use. We cannot find any place that is blocking port 25. The new NAT rule also has ZERO traffic statistics, so it doesn't look like anything is even getting off of the new server to use the NAT rule. We have tried IISRESET and stopping and starting the SMTP server multiple times. The test always fails with the error 10061. My Google fu has gotten me nowhere. Is it possible that Windows Server 2012 R2 could still be blocking outgoing traffic on port 25, even though the firewall is turned off? What are we missing? 

In virtual box, we may encounter timeout & dracut error. You just need to enter exit in the dracut shell. So that the installation will continue. 

I am thinking that there has to be a way in mailx command which allows the mail to be send with html format or atleast the tab spaced output as seen in the linux. if this doesn't work by anyways then I need to get the sendmail working. 

After quite a bit of searching, I found that I needed to create the /dev/ptmx and /dev/pts structures inside the chroot. 

The output of mount also have these in mount point. devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,relatime,seclabel,mode=620,ptmxmode=000) I have ran the below updates in the server. 

I have created a kickstart file and pointed the location. But I am not able to proceed further. I have seen options telling you need to have a vnc console and proceed. But I am looking for a text only automatic installation. I am trying to install this over ssh, so vnc or console is not an option for me. Any help is much appreciated. 

I have an existing SMTP server on our network that is used to send emails from a variety of printers, applications, etc... I have installed the IIS SMTP Server on a new Windows Server 2012 R2 server to replace the current SMTP server in use. To set it up, I copied the settings from the existing SMTP server almost exactly, except for the change in internal IP address. We have an SPF record so that we can send emails without the use of a smarthost or routing through our mail provider. We have had no problems with it. To avoid updating our SPF record, we set up our Sonicwall rules to route both SMTP servers' outgoing email to appear to be from the same external address, smtp.domain.com. This what our NAT rules look like: Internal (smtp.domain.com) 192.168.1.2 -> 68.68.68.68 (smtp.domain.com) Internal (primarysmtp.domain.com) 192.168.1.3 -> 68.68.68.68 (smtp.domain.com) We changed a printer to use the new SMTP server (primarysmtp.domain.com) for testing. The emails are received by the SMTP server and put in the Queue folder, which is good. Now, we cannot get these emails to send. I downloaded the SMTPDIAG tool for testing. At first I thought it was a DNS issue, but that checks out on the test. It will not connect to the target email provider. 

I have installed the required packages for KVM virtualization on my server. Now I am trying to install a KVM guest. But I am not able to install it. Below is the command which I have tried to do. 

I have increased the nproc limit in my server to 2047. And I hope that resourse unavailable message will not come again But while entering the java command itself, it is throwing the error "Insufficent memory". I tried to set the java heap memory but that also not allowing. I am not sure how to proceed further. Please help!! OS is Centos 6.8 Java Version is Jdk 1.6 Virtualization is LXC multiple Virtual machines are running in host server. Free memory is 15GB across all virtual machines. 

Here the important line is cmdline Now we can run the below command to install the KVM guest. This command can be run on a Physical server. 

I have an LXC container with CentOS 7.4 running. On running expect from Normal user I am getting the below error. 

Does anyone know of any corporate anti-virus solutions available for a Windows environment that is not license based? Everything I have ever seen is either client or user license based, plus the management software. I'm thinking along the lines of Barracuda Networks business model for their products, where you buy the product based on needed resources and not user or client count. Just wondering if this business model in the antivirus world even exists. If so, are they good products? Thanks. 

It ended up being a DNS issue. The new server had a total of 5 IP addresses assigned to it. Even though we specified the IP address for the SMTP server to use, when the connection was being made it would resolve back using the computer name and a different IP address than the one we specified. We added outbound SMTP rules on the firewall for all of the IP addresses on the server and it is working now. 

The Net Use command will only show me what drives that only I have mapped when I am logged into the server. What is the easiest way to see all mapped drives for all users and the status of the drives? Thanks. EDIT I'm specifically looking for all disconnected drives for all users that are not longer valid so I can disconnect them. I believe the old disconnected mapped drives are causing problems regarding Outlook and inserting attachments to emails. EDIT AGAIN (WHY NOT?) My original thought was that someone, somewhere created a tool that displayed this information, and that I was just unable to find it. 

Thanks to the website $URL$ I have quoted the script and the details from the above site. After executing the script, I was able to execute the command 

I have a requirement to send the output of certain output as an email to myself. like etc. I have used mailx command with override of smtp host with command , I was able to receive the mail but the formatting was not correct and it came as a . It is not aligned and it is getting difficult to read the content. In all the forums/blogs, I saw that we will be able to send the html content inside mail using sendmail. But I wanted to try out by overriding the smtp host. But unable to do the same. Any help would be much appreciated. 

Since I am using the LXC containers, all the processes of the VM's are are originated from the Host server. So number of process on the host server was very large if we exclude the root user. Initially thought that it may be because of Java Heap space issue and i tried to increase the heap space to a larger value. But the issue was repeating. I resolved the issue by increasing the number of process for user in Host server
