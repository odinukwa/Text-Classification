Im currently on starting strength, been doing it since the 3rd week of December (prior to that Ive been doing some dumbbell lifting, which was from October to November). Squat is at 155lbs Deadlift at 175lbs Bench at 115lbs Overhead press at 90lbs Ive made what I think are significant advances to my lifts but have injured myself a bit from time to time because of terrible form. Ive managed to fix some of my form issues for the past 3 weeks but have found that while I continue to relearn the lifts by fixing form, I struggle to handle the increasing lift load demanded by the program. Im unsure if its because of my diet or just my form (I believe its both though) that I struggle. Anyway, to cut to the chase, I want to do SS again by resetting my weights (i.e. starting with just 45lbs for all exercises) for a month and then moving up to my current PRs again, this time with proper form. However Im unsure of what might happen to my PRs and my muscle gains if I do this. But I really feel this deload is crucial for me to move forward. Im planning to continue my IF with a 4 hr feeding window, and then doing a -30% on rest days while maintenance on training days. The reason behind the deficit is because Ive recently upped my bf% to around 16% and would like to at least go down to 12% in 2 months or so. tl;dr: Would deloading for a week to fix form issues work for me or would it be counter productive? I will do -30% cals on rest days and maintenance on training days since Im at around 16% bf and would like to be at 12% bf in 2 months time with intermittent fasting. 

If you want to lose weight, the bottom line will always be calories, so if you're eating extra carbs to help with your runs, you'll have to eat less calories to balance it back out. As was already stated, fats aren't as readily available for energy as carbohydrates, so they are ideal for low intensity exercise like walking and doing normal daily activities. I am a bodybuilder (used to be a runner) - The most important time for a bodybuilder to take in carbohydrates is post workout because when the body is depleted it needs to absorb nutrients like amino acids. Carbohydrates increase insulin levels which in turn increases the body's ability to uptake nutrients. So, bodybuilders take in protein with carbohydrates post workout. The second most important time for bodybuilders to take in carbs is pre workout for all the same reasons that a runner takes in carbs before their workout. Disclaimer...The following is just my loose interpretation of what's going on in your body during a run. When you take off for a run and are full of nervous energy and maybe a little jumpy, you're running on sugar in the bloodstream. That doesn't last very long before you "settle into a pace" and start burning glycogen that is stored in your muscles when you eat carbohydrates. When a runner "hits the wall" it feels like a sudden loss of energy as if you can not possibly go any further. I believe this to be the point at which glycogen has become depleted. If you push past the wall and maintain a strong pace despite all the signals your body is telling you, you'll "get your second wind". At this point, I believe your body has transitioned from burning glycogen to metabolizing protein for energy. When exercising at a high intensity, fat is not as efficient an energy source as muscle tissue, so it is not likely that fat is being burned primarily. Sometimes you can "hit the wall" again. If you continue to push past that for very long and get a third wind, you'll get "runner's high" which is your body releasing endorphins because that's all you have left to run on. I miss runner's high. 

Im currently on a intermittent fasting regimen and my family has finally caught up to what Ive been doing. Theyre basically saying that im killing myself and this is not the way to lose weight/be healthy. Coming from a family that food and eating together 2 to 3 times a day is a center, this is tough for me. We tend to argue alot when I tell them I simply just dont eat when im not hungry and that I only eat at specific times of the day. Ive been worming out one excuse after the other but theyre calling BS now on most of it. Most of the time its my mom who is going ape about it, and with good reason too (I had hyper acidity growing up, she insists that it will comeback because of fasting, while in fact deprogramming my body with IF has tremendously helped my acidity issues to the point that I dont experience hyper acidity anymore) 

Reverse curls are done with the palm down. They primarily work the brachialis and the brachioradialis. Hammer curls are done with the the palm facing inward. They work the biceps brachii, the brachialis, and the brachioradialis more equally than the other two positions. The standard curl is done with the palms facing up. They primarily work the biceps brachii. 

In my experience, runner's high is only obtained after you "hit the wall" and get your "second wind". You have to run past the wall and hit a second wall before you get "runner's high". I always thought it was a result of the release of endorphins. In order to reach a runner's high faster, you have to run at a high level of intensity for an extended period of time. The more you train, the better level of conditioning you reach, which means you have to continue to push yourself even harder to reach a real runner's high. Evolutionarily, I think it's a survival mechanism. It allows you to push past all feedback from your body that tells you to stop, and continue anyway. 

I've read this article here. Stating that BCAA suppliments can be substituted by consuming the whites of two hard boiled eggs prior to working out. I've been on an intermittent fasting regimen for more than a month now but have never tried consuming BCAA prior to working out (or any kind of supplement pre/post workout for that matter). Would the inclusion of 2 hard boiled egg whites improve my workout, protein synthesis, etc in the long run? I'm kind of afraid that by consuming the egg whites pre work out I might break my fast hours before I even want to start eating my post work out meal. 

I'm surprised to see that there is such a debate concerning types of fats. I don't think there are really different opinion camps on this. The following is not nuance. It is just the same information that you'd get if you asked any personal trainer or bodybuilder this question. Saturated fats are from pigs, cows, and egg yolks. Saturated fats are saturated with hydrogen atoms. They are a very stable molecules that do not react very readily in the body, and are more difficult to access for energy, so they are more likely to be stored for later use. These can be stored where ever your body stores fat and can also be stored along artery walls, and can cause heart disease. These types of fats should be limited. Fats in red meat and pork products should be limited, but that does not mean it's necessary to eliminate all red meat and pork products rather limit the fat content by choosing lean cuts of these meats. Also remember that dairy products that are not fat free contain a considerable amount of saturated fats. Primarily cheese, even white cheeses contain a lot of saturated fat and should be minimized. Although some people eat cheese as a protein source, I do not believe it should be considered as such. The amount of calories from fat in cheese is well over half even in a low fat cheese. Egg yolks have notable amounts of cholesterol in addition to saturated fat. Cholesterol has been credited with increasing levels of testosterone, so it may be worth taking in a moderate amount for this purpose. Unsaturated fats are from fish and plant sources. They are called essential fatty acids because your body does not make them on its own, so you have to take them in through your diet. Unsaturated fats have fewer hydrogem molecules than saturated fats, so they will contain one or more double bonds which makes them a polarized molecule thus more reactive in the body. This means your body can break it down more readily to use it for energy. Polyunsaturated fats are unsaturated fats that have 2 or more double bonds. In addition, unsaturated fats can combine with saturated fats and pull away a hydrogen atom converting it to an unsaturated fat. In this manner unsaturated fats can help you both burn stored fat and break down fatty acids in the blood stream for a healthier cardiovascular system. I suggest taking in unsaturated fats at least once or twice a day. The best sources are nuts and plant oils including peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, flax oil, etc. You'd be hard pressed to eliminate saturated fats completely from your diet because most unsaturated fats have some amount of saturated fats in addition and vise versa. You just have to read labels and consider how much you are getting of one compared to the other. I should also include a note about trans fats which are a chemically created form of saturated fats. Trans fats should not just be limited but avoided completely. They have been proven to not only increase bad cholesterol, but to decrease good cholesterol. Trans fats can be found in icings, cooking lard like crisco, and many processed foods because they also act as a preservative. 

I've recently experimented with low carbing, calorie reduction and fasting. I think I messed it up for the past two weeks and have lost most of the muscle mass Ive gained. I am a novice, started getting into calorie counting, macronutrient partitioning, fasting and weight lifting (with starting strength) at around october of 2013. Ive gained mass and lost some due to my erroneous dieting schemes. I tended to binge on some days then fast for 40 hours afterwards to keep up with my binges. I recently found out that my fear of carbs, while helping me lose body fat for a few days, ultimately led me to a downward spiral of binging after days of deprivation. To cut things short, my last binge and fast afterwards episode has left me with muscle mass that is close to what I had when I was starting out and the body fat I have now has started to bounce back to levels I so dreaded to keep it away from. Is there anyway I can recover my muscle mass? My strength hasnt diminished yet but my muscle mass did. Ot are things too late for me? 

In general, I don't think that whether you're hungry or not is relevant at all. Just because you're hungry doesn't mean that you don't have sufficient glycogen stores for a run. If you are hungry, the hunger will probably subside once you start running as exercise causes you to have an increase in insulin. Any increase in insulin is followed by a low, at which point you'll feel the hunger return. This may be after you're run, or if you're exercising for a longer period, it could be before your workout is over. Cardio for weight loss is often suggested to be done first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, that way you will start burning stored glycogen immediately, and if you're eating a low carb diet, possibly go directly to burning fat for energy. Again, whether you're hungry or not is still irrelevant. If you just ate, you will burn sugar in the bloodstream first when you run. Depending on your metabolism, and how long since your last meal, you might not even digest that last meal yet because blood will be pulled to the extremities during your run, and away from the stomach in order to supply oxygen to the muscles working during exercise. 

I have read that rest weeks are beneficial for body builders since that extra week of recovery (vs a rest day) helps them gain muscle by constituting the healing process the muscle requires, is the same thing applicable to people who are going for fat loss? I have noticed decreasing levels of intensity and all out motivation to work out because of over training, and I was suggested I go on a rest week, would this help me in my fat loss venture? I feel so guilty today since it is day one of my rest week that I want to workout already though I feel like Im so tired. 

Like Greg said... Most ab exercises target slow twitch muscle fibers, so they can be trained on a daily basis. However, since slow twitch muscle fibers have a greater propensity to grow, they might not be what you want to target in order to get a 6 pack. Nonetheless, without decreasing your body fat, the sculpted abs will never show. When training abs, you need to remember to target the muscle group at several different angles in order to work every part of the core. 

For your quads and glutes, you can vary your squat stance between close to wide from week to week. Adding weighted lunges would be a movement that will target your glutes a little more. Plyometrics are also a great way to target fast twitch muscle groups and you can hit lots of different angles this way. I also thought that a row movement for the back was missing. What do you mean by "incline dumbbell raise" for the serratus? Did you mean a dumbbell pullover?
