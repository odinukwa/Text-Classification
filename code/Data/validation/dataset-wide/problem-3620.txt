Protein shakes will be most effective when your muscles are in a state of disrepair. As such, you should drink it after the workout. Before the workout, consider eating/drinking something that gives you more energy in the gym, such as fruit and/or a handful of nuts. Optionally, there are pre-workout supplements out there, but I'd rather advise that you look to food instead of supplements whenever possible. 

This is indeed a challenging thing depending on your forearm strength, but you can progress into it by simply gradually placing your grip higher and higher on the bar. In addition to relieving a lot of tension on the brachioradialis (which is most likely the issue you're having), it also contributes greatly to your forearm strength. In any case, I would always recommend varying your grip from time to time, but you should never avoid the overhand grip unless you really, really have to. Specifically because, as you mention in your question, it tends to utilize the back muscles in a more significant way. That's generally what we look for in our pullups. 

There seems to be a misconception here. Not all weight lost is fat. Some of it is definitely muscle. Probably at least half. Yes, when you burn fat, you burn fat from everywhere, but the repositories in and around your stomach area are far larger than the others. Getting a noticable reduction in waist girth means you simply have to lose more fat. But at the same time, I have to draw a question mark here. 68kgs at 171cm doesn't seem obese for a male. In fact, I'd wager that a good bit of the weight you lost was muscle mass. And if you didn't achieve a noticable change in waist size, this strengthens the theory that you didn't lose as much fat as you thought. 

Absolutely valid. And I have another point that I always dish out to anyone and everyone; for the love of all that is good, go swimming! I cannot emphasize this enough, so let me just say it again, GO SWIMMING! Swimming is this miracle of an exercise where you do this repetetive, aerobic movement (cardio), but with the added resistance of water (strength training). And on top of this, there are so many styles and ways of swimming that allow you to work your entire body. I consider myself a fairly decent swimmer, and I'm still learning new strokes and styles, and each time I try a new one, my body reaps the rewards, because of what we call "progressive overloading" where your body develops new neural patterns to adapt to new challenges. Not to mention that you're burning fat, and building muscle at the same time. Gym Going to the gym is never a bad idea either. Talk to someone who works there, and they will gladly help you set up a workout program designed for general fitness. Summary In short, a combination of walking, swimming, and a couple days per week at the gym, is HUGE. And even if you decide to do only one of these, you'll be doing yourself big favors. And hey, if you do decide to just do one of these, I'd highly suggest you pick swimming. 

Start out like everyone else Obviously, you're not excused from working your entire body, because if you just train certain areas, you're messing up your body, so first things first, get a regular training program, and start from there. Rock climbing specific training The one area where rock climbers simply excel beyond anyone else, is the ratio between grip strength and body weight. Additionally, you're going to want the ability to pull your weight upwards. This is something everyone already trains by default; pullups. Grip There are a lot of things you can do, and I personally like these, because of the effect is has on not only my grip strength, but my upper forearm. 

No more than any other exercise. This all depends on your form. If you are relentlessly contorting your back in order to pull 60kg, then yes, it probably will cause injury. If you are selecting a moderate weight, and keeping a good, strict form, then no. It probably won't cause injury. 

I'll be honest, I haven't tried it. It sounds very awkward, and you're probably very limited in terms of what kind of weight you can use. Also, you'd be limited by what kind of dumbbells are present in your gym. Presumably you're attempting to get a good hamstring workout by doing these curls (as that is usually associated with weighted knee flexion). What I suggest you do instead is a variety of 

70 days of inactivity will have a muscle atrophy effect. There are measures to limit the extent to which muscle wanes, but still, without use, they will deteriorate. I don't know what NASA is planning to do to counter these effects, but researchers have found that neuromuscular electrical stimulation can keep muscle protein synthesis active in comatose patients. While I'm not sure if NASA is braving these territories, it certainly provides a sense of what can be achieved. Especially since 70 days is quite limited compared to the time one can be comatose.

Question Is there any measurable drawback to doing one big leg exercise, then doing upper body work for a while, and then doing legs again? My first instinct is that I'd have to warm up again, which is easily done by doing some light sets, and increasing gradually. But besides that? 

Gaining muscle It's undeniable that after fasting for 16 hours (as an example), your body might not be as physically capable as it was a couple hours after a hearty meal. So it might be a good idea to get your weightlifting in during the eating window. After you've had some food, and with at least one protein-rich meal afterwards. Fat-loss From a fat loss perspective, I absolutely love going for fasted walks before breaking my fast. Getting up in the morning, chugging some water to get the engine room working, and going for a nice, brisk walk. The longer you extend your fast, the longer the body will use fat stores to replenish energy, and the morning is an excellent time to take advantage of that. My recommendation ...is to go for a walk before your first meal, having only consumed water. Optionally with some vitamin supplements in said water, but add no calories. Then time your weight training such that you have had a meal or two, and you can get some protein in afterwards. Using myself as an example I've been doing intermittent fasting almost inadvertently for a couple years now. I was recommended to try IF, and when I was trying to schedule my day, I realized that I only had to change one little detail; stop snacking after dinner. My day goes as follows: I wake up between 7 and 9AM. I have some water and I take the bus to work. I get off the bus 2-3 stops before the nearest stop to my work, so I can get a little walk. I eat my first meal at 11AM. I make it pretty big, but healthy. Usually a large salad, or leftover dinner. At 1PM and 2PM, I snack on fruit. At 3PM, I grab some more fruit, and leave work and go to the gym to lift. At this point, my energy is high, my blood sugar is at a stable high, giving me lots of energy for heavy work. I usually arrive home and will have dinner at around 6PM, and that's my last meal of the day. It used to be I would snack during the evening, but that's the adjustment I made when deciding to try IF. I stopped snacking after dinner, and I haven't since. This gives me an eating window of about 7 hours, which means I fast for about 17 hours. Following the rule-of-thumb, that means I have 11 hours of my body burning fat exclusively for energy. 

First, some anecdotal tips. What I've noticed is that when I'm lifting heavy, and it's quite clear that my grip is the limiting factor, I'll literally break form because I'm focusing so much on my grip that I forget to focus on the important stuff like thoracic extension, neck position, shoulder engagement, relative joint angles in the hip/knee/ankle etc. What I can recommend is that when you know you're going heavy, and you know your grip is a potential game breaker; use straps. Yes, you lose out on the grip training a deadlift offers, but it's very easy to compensate for this by doing some grip-specific exercises afterwards. 

If it's harmful for the spine, it will let you know in the form of pain or exhaustion. Since you're working with weights less than 100kg, there generally isn't much reason to believe that your back can't handle it. Adding 12kg to 86kg isn't a drastic change. Your skeleton has already handled weight on this order for a long time already. If you're able to do the reps, it's safe to say your back is up to the task. I assume here, that you're not going from bodyweight to adding weight in huge increments. 

Poop when you need to poop. For a walk as short as 5km, emptying your bowels beforehand isn't important at all. 

So yes, I think two weeks is a very short time to gauge any progress, but if you're already lifting the entire stack on all the machines, you should be doing free weights instead, under supervision. 

No, there's no complete way of comparing performances like that, because those are only 3 variables (rep/set/weight), out of hundreds. If you want to solidly compare them, you'd have to take into account form, variation, time spent during concentric/eccentric portions of the lift, rest period between reps, rest period between sets, and the list goes on and on. I mean, can you say that these are all completely equal every rep? Almost certainly not. And even if you could, there are still many other variables to consider. 

It's easy to get confused, but most exercises have very descriptive names, and some of them cover entire classes of exercises. The gist of it Pressing means you're pressing/pushing something away from you, such as bench press or overhead press. Notice again that the other words are pretty descriptive too. "Bench" and "overhead" both help describe the movement. Pulling or rowing means you're pulling something towards you, such as pull-ups and pull-downs, as well as cable rows, upright rows, dumbell rows etc. Extensions are exercises where you extend either your arms or legs against a resistance. Examples here are cable tricep extensions and leg extensions. You'll find leg extension machines in most gyms, as well as cable equipment. You'll know it when you see it. Curls are the opposite of extensions. Here, you close the elbow or knee joint versus resistance. Examples are bicep curls and leg curls. The former comes in huge variety. Moderators There is a huge number of movements for all of the mentioned classes, but again, most of them have very descriptive names. Take for instance the incline bench press. Here, we are obviously using a bench, which is sloped a bit, so you're more upright (hence incline). And we're again pressing something. But it doesn't say what you're pressing, so it could be either a barbell or a couple of dumbells. So if someone says "let's do incline bench press", it's perfectly natural to ask "bar or dumbells?". So an even better name would be incline barbell chest press, but you'll get used to a lot of these short-hands. Stand-alone names A lot of exercises have their own names, simply because describing them would be too long to call it a name. Take for instance the skullcrusher which would have to be named flat bench close grip barbell tricep extensions to be descriptive. (Granted, some of these words are open for change depending on the person doing it.) No one will think any less of you for asking what exactly a "french press" or a "concentrated curl" is. But know this, you can find videos of ANY exercise simply by googling the name as you hear it. In fact, I suggest you do this for most of the exercises I've mentioned in this answer. 

Overhead press can be very demotivating if done right, because the right way is heavier. What happens when you lean back, is that the chest muscles assist more, and chest muscles are predominantly stronger than the shoulder muscles, by virtue of being larger and more frequently used in general. The lean-back however, can damage your spine in the long run. The reason for this is that your lower thoracic spine is bent during the lift, and with all that extra weight on top of it, that's not something your back should endure. Keep your back straight. A good rule-of-thumb here is to look straight ahead. Don't look up at the bar. You know where it is, and it's not going anywhere. If you're still having problems with this, and leaning back by default, consider lowering the bar behind your neck, instead of in front, on your chest. This will force you not to lean backwards.
