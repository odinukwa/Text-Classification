there's mysticism here. a simulation of a human is a human. it's the same thing. human minds are software running in a classical computer. that's what you already are – a computer running software. the hardware details don't matter to the computations. no soul or organic molecules required. an intelligence software program has to do certain things. included on the list is create knowledge. the only known knowledge-creating process is evolution. knowledge can be created through replication with variation and selection. (in the case of ideas this would more normally be called brainstorming and critical thinking to eliminate errors). software that does this within various parameters, and does a few other things, would be a thinking person. that's all there is to it. stuff like emotions are emergent properties of software, they aren't tied to souls, hardware made of organic molecules instead of silicon, etc 

no. individuals face problems like how to live their life and stay alive. this leads to various problems (like getting food and shelter) and solutions. this process of problem solving requires thinking. the thinking should be done in certain ways and not other ways, like it should be non-contradictory. overall what you say doesn't really have much to do with Objectivism's perspective. 

the arguments against Objectivism are mostly from people who don't understand Objectivism. but an actual issue with Objectivism is induction. induction has logical problems as explained by Karl Popper and many others. Rand knew that she couldn't explain how induction worked and defend it in detail, but she still mistakenly assumed that it works somehow. 

what else? the broader goal is to seek out criticisms of Popper, Rand and others that don't suck, and define some criteria for "don't suck" that will be acceptable on this site. 

the consequences of rejecting induction are being freed up to learn something better from Karl Popper. all your concerns come from basically taking a typical inductivist epistemology and then rejecting one central part (induction) and keeping the rest. what you need is a thoroughly non-inductivist epistemology which is built from the ground up to make sense without induction. that's what Popper offers. (so far there are no non-Popperians offering this). 

Reading Speed it's really really valuable to learn speed reading so you can read more philosophy. reading a lot (and rereading) does matter. if you can't read philosophy at 500 or more words per minute, it will be hard to do as much as those who can. it's also valuable to be able to read using both text and audio so you can read books while going for a walk or driving or at the gym, etc. you can listen to ebooks using text to speech software such as $URL$ (you aren't limited to audio books) the most effective speed reading approach is called Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. here's a free web version to see what it is (it takes a while to learn and get good with it, but you may be able to use it around your normal reading speed immediately. you can do higher speeds with 2 or 3 words at a time instead of just 1, and some people also find 3-4 words at a time is easier initially): $URL$ learning how to skim well, skip around to the important parts of books, look up relevant parts in the index, etc, is also extremely valuable. good skimming can save even more time than speed reading. both speed reading and skimming can have major downsides if done badly. you can lose a lot of comprehension of the material. but if done with enough skill and good judgement, they can work for most material, and you can occasionally slow down as needed. (as you get better at it, you can slow down less often for less kinds of material.) and reading faster allows more rereads. if you can do 2-3 fast reads instead of 1 slow read of a book, that's usually better. or do 1 slow read and 2-3 fast reads instead of 2 slow reads – that's pretty much always better. and getting good at speed reading can improve your minimum reading speed too. Rest Regarding rest, knowledge workers like programmers typically do about 10-20 hours a week of really serious hard work. They spend the rest of the time answering emails, doing meetings, checking reddit, etc. Most people can do more temporarily but would burn out if they kept it up. People also tire from other types of thinking such as playing chess or reading difficult philosophy. Getting tired normal. People also like excuses for not doing much. So be careful! Some people are exceptional. The philosopher Karl Popper had a reputation for working long hours all the time and not doing much else. Try to be honest about how much rest you really need. The more you really like your work, the more it should energize and inspire you! If that isn't happening, maybe something's wrong. 

you should survey some important philosophies and get involved with highly critical philosophy discussion. criticism is necessary to find errors. one of the main problems with philosophy is lots of people have a bunch of bullshit ideas and don't realize all the problems with their ideas. the list of philosophies you take a look at should include Objectivism (Ayn Rand) and Critical Rationalism (Karl Popper) in addition to stuff like artistotle and kant which everyone recommends (i think they're bad, but you decide). the only very good philosophy discussion forum i'm aware of is $URL$ (this is a Q&A site, which is a different structure with advantages and disadvantages. it's fine but it's different than open-ended discussion where people just chat and argue) 

No empirical falsification is ever decisive whether the theory is probabilistic or not. Popper discussed this, e.g. section 29 of LScD "THE RELATIVITY OF BASIC STATEMENTS". the basic issue, also known as the duhem-quine problem, is whenever you have a refutation either the refuted theory is wrong OR the refutation itself could be wrong, so it's never totally clear, decisive and settled. So what do you do instead? You criticize and stop seeking certainty. You try to find bad ideas and reject them. Does it makes sense? Any logical issues? Does it solve the problem it's supposed to solve? Does it cause any problems? You look for good qualities for ideas and things wrong with them. Do your best to think and improve your ideas. Grow your knowledge instead of yearning for final unquestionable answers. This works the same with probabilistic and non-probabilistic theories. 

As a living thing, one has preferences, which are "states or situations that one seeks above others." "Purpose" is the relationship that a given person, object, event, or idea has with the thinker's preferences. It's shorthand for "the use that the subject under discussion has in seeking the preferences of someone else." Unless specified, that "someone else" is "the speaker, or an imagined person based on the speaker." Preferences are either biological urges (oxygen, food, water, sleep, breeding, heat) or personal values (learning, interest/fun, justice, confidence/achievement/respect, personal relationships, or freedom). These things will be different depending on who the "one" is in statement #1. "Meaning" is inseparable from preferences. An object has meaning to us only if it affects our preferences. That doesn't mean that we can't care about impractical things, since interest/fun is a huan value, only that nothing wholly disconnected to our values can have meaning to us. Meaning is inherently relative, which I know is a word that most of the kind of people that care about philosophy hate/fear. It is, though. So, meaning means "the effect that something has on one's preferences," and purpose means "the use that something has on our attaining one's preferences." They're closely linked. One step further, if we consider knowledge itself as but one more tool to seek preferences, than the distinction between meaning and purpose collapses totally. However, that's not really satisfactory, right? So, let's go at it from a slightly different angle. A thing has meaning if it affects our preferences, which means if it helps us decide what to prefer or helps figure out how to get them. How does it do that? The biggest obstacle to attaining one's preference is ignorance, ignorance or which preferences are best and ignorance of how to get them. A mind or brain can be said to be smarter if that mind or brain is better at making predictions about the future than some other mind or brain (the same one a year ago, for example). You're smarter than someone else if you are better at making predictions than them about something that you both regard as worthwhile. People make predictions by assuming that the future will be like the past to the degree that it is similar to the past. Of course, that also means that the future will be different from the past to the degree that it is different from the past. Making a prediction, then, involves consulting one's mind and trying to find the closest match one has for the situation that one wishes to predict, and then making corrections for the way in which that past situation is different from the to-be-predicted one. No two situations are identical, of course, and so this is an inherently imperfect science. So, the meaning of anything is simply where the mind stores it. First, it involves placing it in a category of other things that share one or more attributes, and then distinguishing it from everything else in that category.* The important thing to notice here is that the process of making predictions is analogous to the process of defining a term. This isn't accidental, of course, because things have meaning to us to the degree that they help us make predictions about the future. So, the relationship between meaning and purpose is like the relationship between blueprints and building materials. However, since we can regard the blueprint itself as a tool, meaning is can also be understood as a subset of purpose. Categories, though are imaginary groupings, and in saying that meaning can be seen as a subset of purpose, can be is a key phrase. 

This is a really oddly worded question. It seems as though it's equivalent to "What is the purpose of meaning?" and moving it up one level to "'What does the purpose of meaning?' mean?"doesn't really change the question. To answer it, you need satisfying answers to "purpose" and "meaning." Here's a shot. 

I do think that it is a worthwhile project to establish levels of complexity for ideas, which I currently do as follows: Idea Complexity (0) -- The thing on both the left and right side of the relationship is not another idea. Idea Complexity (1) -- One of the two sides in an idea's formulation is itself an idea. Idea Complexity (2) -- Both of the sides in an idea's formulation are themselves ideas. That my car is blue is a fact. is already an idea at Complexity Level 2. Trying to make it more complex, like "The sentence 'That my car is blue is a fact' is untrue," does not create a more fundamentally complex idea, but only makes the ideas on both sides more convoluted. Of course, complicating all of this is that sentences in any language really cannot involves non-ideas. You have to be able to imagine that an idea about the pencil before me is actually about the pencil and not about the word string "the pencil before me." 

Generally, we talk and act as if there are four kinds of things in the world -- consciousnesses, objects, events, and ideas. An idea is a relationship between two other things in the world. We can construct a rough formula of an idea, THING1 RELATIONSHIP THING2. Remember, things can be consciousnesses, objects, events, or OTHER ideas. This is what makes nailing down a definition of idea difficult, but I thinks solves the current question. A fact is a kind of idea, so it is a relationship. To state something as a fact is logically equivalent to this [IDEA1][CORRESPONDS TO THE SITUATIONS OF THE][WORLD OF OBJECTS, OTHER CONSCIOUSNESSES, AND/OR EVENTS]. Look, though, the definition of a fact requires a definition of "a idea that corresponds to the reality of other things in the universe." The definition of fact is already a metafact. Therefore, every idea claims as a fact is already about it's fact-ness. Labeling some as meta is probably impossible.
