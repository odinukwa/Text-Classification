Lumens is the amount of light emitted from your torch. If the same amount light is spread in a tight beam, say 6 degrees, it will appear much brighter than the same amount of light spread over a wider beam, e.g. a 12 degree beam is about 4 times the area than a 6 degree beam, so will appear to be less bright. The big issue is the type of conditions you dive in. If there's a lot of sediment in the water, as is normal for UK diving, then you'll find a wide beam produces a lot of back-scatter, whereas a tighter beam will produce less. It's like driving though fog where it's best to use a dipped beam than full beam. Being slightly cynical, there's Lumens and there's Lumens. A lot of the cheap and nasty far-eastern torches will claim enormous amounts of Lumens; quite frankly many appear to be made up numbers. Also cheap torches are a waste of money; they break after a few usages and literally dissolve in the water. There's nothing worse than discovering your torch won't work when you need it. The best torches are heavy-duty with descent sized batteries. These are normally umbilical meaning a thick cable connects the torch head in your hand to the battery on your waist belt. The torch head usually has a "Goodman handle" which effectively frees your hand with the torch head on the back of your hand. Needless to say umbilical torches are expensive >$500, but they're very reliable and have several hours of battery life. My primary torch is a Light-For-Me 4Tec which has 1200 Lumens in a 6 degree beam pattern and a battery life of over 5 hours -- easily enough for a weekend. Other similar torches are available, all are excellent and reliable. Smaller backup torches tend to use the "screw" head to turn them on and use standard non-rechargable batteries. This is because rechargable batteries discharge over time; you don't want to discover this when your main torch has failed. You did check your torch before you dived in?!? Backup torches are normally stowed on your chest harness, below your D-ring. If diving in an overhead environment you always take at least two backup torches and one primary torch. Typically they'll have a tight beam and be of the order of a few hundred Lumens. My 3 x AA battery backup torches (Ammonite LED1) last for a couple of hours; easily enough to last the rest of a dive. Another benefit of a tight beam pattern is for signalling. You can communicate using "passive signalling" to your buddy where you are: typically if your buddy is in front of you, your beam will be pointing just in front of them so they can see you're keeping up. You use active signalling to get their attention, or rapidly waving the torch beam around to immediately get their attention in emergency. Recreational torches tend to have wider beam patterns, so need a much greater light output. This means that to be small they have a short battery life at full power. They can easily cost the same as a fully-featured technical umbilical torch with many hours of battery life. The other type of torch is a video torch. If you're taking photos, you'll need a very wide beam spread, so you'll need an enormous light output spread across the beam to light up the target. These can be eye-wateringly expensive, easily >$1000. So lots of choices. 

Because it's fundamentally meaningless and the skills aren't particularly useful outside of training or within the PADI system - c.f. the tech skills above 

Practice and remaining calm underwater seems to be the key to reducing your gas consumption. Most new divers consume lots of gas due to the unfamiliarity of being underwater, novice skills, and the ubiquitous overweighting. After a while, you learn to control your buoyancy and get your weighting correct: enough to stay down with a nearly empty cylinder (circa 30 bar) and no more. You also learn that winter diving means thicker undersuits / wetsuits which are a lot more buoyant, so additional weight is needed to counteract it. With more practice you'll consume a lot less gas as skills become far more simple and an awful lot less stress. Gas consumption is measured as the "Surface Air Consumption" rate (SAC rate) in litres per minute. As we all know, for every 10 metres of depth, add 1 bar of pressure. So, at 20 metres, you'll be at 3 bar which is 3 times the surface pressure. If you have an SAC of 15 litres/minute, you'll consume 3x15 = 45 litres per minute at 20 metres, or 60 litres/minute at 30 metres. Your SAC will vary greatly depending on what you're doing underwater. If you're vigorously swimming against a current, your SAC will easily double and could quadruple in extremis. Those numbers again: if you're really fighting the current your SAC could be 3 times normal, so using 15 as the base, this will be 3 x 15 = 45 which is then multiplied by the pressure, so at 20 metres this is x3, so you're consuming 135 litres / minute, or converting that to bar of a single 12 litre cylinder, that's about 11 bar a minute -- dangerously emptying the cylinder in 13 minutes (using 12 litres x 150 bar) Compare that with a chilled-out drift or gentle bimble where your SAC would be normal (15 l/min) so using 45 l/min at 20 metres, or 40 minutes of gas. With more practice and relaxation, you can get your SAC down to 12 litres/min (or 50 minutes for 150 bar of a 12 litre cylinder). Tech divers tend to use two SAC rates; the "bottom" SAC where you're moving around, and the "deco" SAC where you're hanginging around motionless whilst breathing rich oxygen mixes. For planning, I use a bottom SAC of 15 l/min and 12 l/min for deco, but know I use less. For 'fun' I brought a half-empty deco stage with regulators into the lounge one night and measured the amount of gas I consumed whilst watching the telly and doing some internet browsing -- must have looked odd with a reg in my mouth and a clothes peg on my nose! In that 20 minutes, my SAC was 7 litres/minute. So, in answer to your question; you'll need to be moderately fit. But the main thing is to be relaxed, which is much easier if you practice your skills, especially the art of doing nothing - buoyancy & weighting. The more you practice, the better you'll be. 

Use a drysuit. These insulate, are far warmer than a wetsuit and are an additional source of buoyancy. Two varieties, neoprene & 'membrane'. Typically neoprene is cheaper so your first drysuit is neoprene then you move on to membrane. To cut to the chase: membrane means there's little insulation, but there's hardly any evaporation so it's much warmer on the surface than a neoprene drysuit -- such as on a RIB motoring at speed back from a dive. All insulation is gained by your multiple layers of underclothes. This is great as you can change your undergarments to suit the conditions -- don't forget to adjust your weighting as you need more weight to counteract the additional buoyancy of the insulation. Membrane also doesn't 'squeeze' so doesn't change it's buoyancy characteristics during a dive as does a wetsuit or neoprene drysuit. I "cheat" in the winter and use a (Santi) heated vest fed from a dedicated large 18AH battery through an E/O connector into the vest. You won't be warm, but you're certainly not shivering, especially important if you're decompressing. Also use drygloves with decent inner gloves, two (or three) layers of socks and a thick hood. Did a 100 minute dive in a 2 degree lake this winter and only boredom got me out of the water -- I had 5 layers on top: a thermal vest; thermal T-shirt; the heated vest; a long-sleeved rash-vest; a thick winter insulated long-sleeved top (Fourth Element Arctic Expedition). I also use the same membrane drysuit in warmer condtions; it's great at 24 degrees with a thin layer of insulation. In fact I regularly practice with my drysuit in a 32degree heated pool. If buying a drysuit, make sure it's fitted with large pockets on the sides. Also make sure the suit exhaust dump is on the side of the arm, not the front (which some manufacturers seem to think is easier to get to, not realising that you don't touch the valve during a dive - once you set it to wide open). Then there's the solution to excess hydration: a "P" valve -- the second most valuable invention in diving after the demand valve! There's nothing worse than having to cut short a dive to keep the drysuit dry inside. Some things to consider about drysuits: 

Moving vertically +-2m is a lot. An awful lot. It shouldn't be more than a few cms. This sounds like there's something else going on. Good buoyancy requires lots of practice to master. The best place to practice is 15cm above a platform at around 6 metres. You should be still; fins not moving; and not moving forwards. Your breathing should be slightly heavier than 'normal', meaning that you need to take slightly larger breaths to clear your 'dead spaces' such as your windpipe, etc. This doesn't mean great gasping breaths, just "normal" breaths. Your buoyancy should be set that when you breathe in, then half out, then hold, you should stay vertically still. A big breath in should mean you'll rise, a big exhale should mean you'll sink. Normal breaths mean you'll be more-or-less stable vertically. If you move up more than about 50cm, you'll probably need to adjust your Buoyancy Control Device (BCD) to reset to a stable platform. The most important issue is to be still in the water. If you're swimming forward, your attitude (trim angle) will have a great effect on your buoyancy, particularly if you're not flat in the water -- many people mask poor buoyancy skills by swimming. As soon as they stop, they sink or float. Buoyancy and trim are probably the two hardest skills to master in SCUBA diving. Once sorted, diving is so much more pleasurable as you can effortlessly hold your position in the water for all sorts of reasons; from taking photos through watching the wildlife, and holding your deco stops if you move into technical diving. Spending time diving in a swimming pool is a good winter passtime.
