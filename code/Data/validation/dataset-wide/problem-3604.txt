Everything else being equal, sure, a myocyte (muscle cell) with more myofibrils (fibers) will be stronger than one that has less. But that's a really narrow statement that dodges the other elements of force production. Just to start with some background: A newborn baby has more muscle cells than a 30 year old pro body builder, it's the size of the myocytes (muscle cells) that increase. As the myocyte increases, cellular components like myofibrils increase. Additionally, the cells contain more intracellular bodies such as mitochondria and house more glycogen. This is why trained muscles get bigger. Greg's answer from 2011 does a good job of explaining why a big body builder can be weaker than a smaller strength athlete. The general deal is that there's more to force production than muscle size. Indeed, body builders aren't even trying for maximum recruitment at once (total strength, low rep range). Your specific question however was: 

Smith Machine is not, and cannot be an alternative to full squat. It works the leg alright, but leg press does that too. Goblet squats are better and superior, you made a good choice. I would recommend you to decrease your cadence, get your reps slower, thus more time under tension, and it will tire you more. Front squats are good, but I believe they are harder to do, simply because it needs perfect rack position and mobility. I would say until you can get a Squat Rack, stick with Goblet Squats. Increase your reps, decrease your resting time, and slower reps would help the exercise to get harder. 

A lot of people are saying otherwise too. The important distinction is the difference between flexibility and mobility. People think flexibility is important, but it is actually inferior to mobility. I would recommend you to look at Kelly Starrett's videos and talks; also he has a very good book about mobility which is called Becoming a Supple Leopard. Lastly, it is never a good idea to stretch cold muscles. If you want to do stretching, please do a light warmup before hand, and choose dynamic stretching over static stretching. Overall, the most important thing is doing full range of motions, without using any momentum in your training. 

Physical fitness tends to decline in "normal" people because normal people are not trained athletes. If you look at professional athletes however, you'll note some big differences. Most winners of the Tour de France (racing nearly every day for a month straight) are in their 30's. Numerous power lifting athletes have continued to pull gold medals into their 40's (drug tested ones included). Other sports, notably the NFL, have an average age of ~26 because the abuse the players suffer is not sustainable long term for most people. It's simply too easy to sustain career ending injuries. Obviously age has certain problems: reduced growth hormone, increased time on earth to sustain injuries, and usually a more sedentary life. But that's very much talking in averages. If you are 25 and have been seriously training since 20, you will likely get clobbered by someone 35 who's also been training since 20 (all other variables being equal). Anecdotaly I hear plenty of locker-room talk from some of the younger guys talking about trashed shoulders and tweaked knees, because they lack long term training experience and are trying to push weight that they are years away from doing safely. a couple of references: $URL$ $URL$ 

The number of reps is not magic, what is important is how hard you work your muscles. Our muscles recruit more motor units with they see more force. The simplest and safest way to do this is doing HIT (not hiit). So, go slow and go 'til you drop. Make sure you use your muscles 100%. It doesn't matter how many reps you do but how much you force your muscles, so that they use all motor units available. But, if you just want to get bigger muscles, eat more and lift 'more' weight :) 

Smith-machine in any way is not superior to barbell squat. You have alternatives though. Front Squats Zercher Squats Hack Squats Goblet Squats 

Do lots of push-ups :) It looks like a lame recommendation but it is the truth. Please look for GTG : Grease the Groove. I could not do 3 dips @ 93 kg of bodyweight. After doing lots of push-ups, I end up doing 30 reps @ same bodyweight. But please, do proper Push-ups, which is triceps push-ups. You can look at Martin Rooney, he is an expert in S&C. Good luck. Ps: I used to do lots of push-ups, like 200-300 at a time. Lots of sets of 10-15-20 reps. I would recommend you to try different variations, EMOM's, AMRAP's. Have fun doing that, eventually; your number will increase. 

In other words, the problem isn't a lack of leptin but rather an insensitivity to it (which is caused by obesity). So rather than looking to leptin to reverse obesity, obesity needs to be reversed so that leptin can function normally. From a 2007 study: 

Progesterone is a muscle relaxant, and also (as explained by our physician) causes a general elasticity of connective tissue (things critical to the expanding nature of a woman's body and the upcoming delivery). Some individuals remain remarkably fit and active through their pregnancies, but I've also seen very fit and active people suffer a lot of complications that have sidelined them. Likewise, the complications after delivery can be significant and lingering. It's not something that people talk about but vaginal and anal damage is more common than most think. The person you're talking about doesn't sound like they're lifting heavy, and exercise is really important towards having a health pregnancy, so they're probably in the clear. But just be flexible and remember every pregnancy is different (even with the same mom) and that the challenges facing a pregnant woman are very different (from multiple factors) between 10, 20, and 30 weeks. 

It is very hard to answer your question without seeing you, or having your body composition values. However, a muscle cannot be toned, it can either grow or shrink (hypertrophy and atrophy). Also, since there is gravity, you cannot expect a muscle to be tight all the time :) 

There are primary movers and secondary movers. You won't have any problems with that split. The aim of muscles are to work :) By that logic, we should not climb stairs after we trained legs. Do not get into that much detail, just go with common sense. 

I would definitely suggest to do "carries"; such as Farmer's walk (2 or 1 hand). It is pretty good for deadlift assistance. Chin-ups would be good for everything :) There are lots of alternatives, they would all have some benefit. You can use BBB for OHP also; you can do high rep lateral and front raises. For deadlifts, you can do speed deadlifts, or power cleans. It is all up to you, you can do hamstring work such as leg curl, you can do stiff-leg deadlifts. 

So that's $3.50 in chicken or $1.85 for whey, gram for gram. Economical whey protein, in this case (2014, United States) costs roughly half that of chicken. Other things to consider: 

In the gym I'd recommend cleans and jump rope. Cleans require you to jump and drive through your calves. I think folks who are doing cleans are putting a lot more load on their calves than the rather always-seems-goofy calf raise. Plus cleans are just awesome in their own right, although they're hard for some to learn (it took me a while). The other I'd put in there is the jump rope. It's a great conditioning exercise and it's a lot of volume on your calves. Most of the hop is generated by the calves, and you use your calves to bounce on the way down. 

"Cardio" still requires more muscle use than a sedentary life style. Sure, it's not squatting heavy weights, and sure it's very high repetitions of the same movement. But look at a competitive cyclist who doesn't do anything but ride: you will see incredibly powerful legs. Big vastus medialis muscles hanging by the knee that looks like they're smuggling avocados. Your body will eventually compensate sufficiently to handle your running load and your muscle gain will flatline: distance running is well outside the effective bounds of hypertrophy (muscle mass increases). You'll gain enough to run, and that's it. Be careful though about assigning any particular weight increases to water, fat, or muscle. I'll weigh myself once a month or so just for the heck of it. More important is my strength standards, conditioning, and performance in chosen athletic field. 

Please learn the difference between assistance work, accessory work, and rehab work. Cuban rotation is not a strength exercise, and therefore should not be done in order to improve strength. If you want shoulder strength, stick with strict presses. I don't remember seeing any Cuban rotations in Mark Rippetoe or Jim Wendler's work. You should start doing these moves with lightest weight possible, and increase in time making sure you don't feel any awkward sensation. 

I don't have any papers, and I don't hate pulldown machines. The main difference is core activation. In a proper pullup, you brace your abs, you contract your glutes and keep your spine in a complete stiff position. Where in a pulldown machine, unfortunately this is very hard to do. 

Your question is wrong, your view is also wrong. But I am going to give my 2 cents regardless. First; Deadlift is a pull, squat is a squat. Squat starts from the top, deadlift starts from the bottom. Knees do not lift anything, if you try and do that you are going to destroy them eventually. Doing deadlifts for repetitions and/or using little rest periods can make your lower back sore, not because you are shortening your erector spinae, but rather because you are using them isometrically. Back does not lift anything, it pulls. And that move is called a barbell row. While deadlifting, your back works because it is trying to stay neutral and stiff not because you are lifting. Actually, that lift is done by hamstrings. It seems like you think that lifting should be done via a deadlift or a squat, whereas it is done by both deadlifting, squatting, and pressing if necessary. Please watch a video of an atlas stone lift. 

It's called Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS), but you'll note the Delayed word there. The pain usually shows up 24 hours later and is gone around 72 hours. It's actually not fully understood (2003 analysis in Sports Medicine): 

Boiled down, there are three reasons for the protein recommendations: 1) Muscle Repair. You are destroying muscle tissue when you do resistance exercises, and your body needs building materials (protein) repair that damage: 

It's a tough answer, and it's based around your endocrine system. Your body releases insulin to direct fat cells to increase their storage. If you do not have an endocrine disorder (such as diabetes), your body will become more insulin sensitive as your body fat drops, therefore you will readily store more fat. The more insulin resistant you are, the less fat you will store. Which sounds awesome except for the part where all that gunk is floating around in your blood stream, causing plaque. Also, depending upon the food you ate, as much as 10% of the calories are simply excreted. I disagree with the idea that the body has an unlimited capacity to store fat. If that was the cause, there would be no plaque and no strokes, because all fat would be readily absorbed into fatty tissues. 

There are different ideas about jumping exercises. I cannot show any references right now, but some people believe doing explosive work increases explosiveness; whereas some people only believe that increasing strength is the only way to increase explosiveness. I believe that one should work out as needed. For example, do you need to do box jumps? Do you need jumping in your daily life? Do you need to get better at jumping and jumping higher? If not, I do not believe that doing box jumps would bring you extra benefit than regular strength training. However, the risk of injury is higher with jumping, which means you need to be more careful with it. 

You can always increase the time you are doing the exercise, increasing the time under tension. In addition to it, you can also do the same exercises with "holds". For example, you can stay in pistol squat deep position for 15 seconds, and do 8-12 reps afterwards, it will be harder to do.
