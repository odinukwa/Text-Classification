YES!! YES! YES! HIIT is now the industry standard for safe and highly effective fat loss whilst conserving muscle mass. Any strength coach worth his salt will prescribe it to natural athletes looking to lose fat without going through the stupidity and pointlessness of regular cardio. A couch potato's initial "high"-intensity in the first week will be the laughing stock of his/her future self. Your first "high" intensity session will be you lumbering along wheezing and panting. The good news is that our body is an amazing adaptive organism. Your heart rate will be more or less the same even as you get more and more powerful and strong. Thats the beauty of HIIT cardio. As your body adapts to be a more efficient powerful machine, you get more out of your hearts BPM. If your BPM is dropping over the coming weeks, then your intensity (speed) isn't building. 

Scientific evidence seems to suggest that nutrition timing is NOT as important as most think. Most of the "common knowledge" surrounding this is based on statistics that show correlations. With plenty of ulterior causations to choose from (e.g. those snacking at night are more likely to get fat because they are eating more food overall), there is no point changing behaviour based on this. There is NO real evidence that if eating a controlled diet, nutrition timing does much at all. Our bodies adapt to whatever we throw at it. Its the daily macronutrient totals that are important. You will find this article very interesting. 

Whether you achieve the goal is speculative. If you have already tried to achieve the goal when you were younger (consistent workout over at least a year) and failed it might be indication that it is not possible for you, but not necessarily so. As for the training, following advice: Running (2 mile run in 11:54 or less) Definitely possible in general. In your particular case, we would need to know your current 2 mile, 5 mile and maybe 1/2 mile times. As for the training, I would skip the elliptical machine. It is often argued (see for example, here) that the best way to improve your running is by running. Instead, do 50 minutes of slow and comfortable running once a week. This will have the same effect on your cardiovascular system as the elliptical machine but also get you used to the movement patterns. It is important that you do not worry/plan increasing speed or duration here too much because it will come very naturally soon. In addition, and instead of 

I am currently trying to learn more about the signals my body is giving. One question I stumbled upon recently is the following: Is there any information to be gained from muscle soreness at different time intervals after a workout? For example, I was doing an extended set of pull-ups 34 hours ago. The soreness in my latissimus dorsi peaked around 14 hours ago; the soreness in my chest peaked around 8 hours ago. Does that give away any information? Is my latissimus simply better adapted to the exercise? Worse? Is it not related at all? I know that the scientific evidence on muscle soreness in general is rather limited. Let alone this specific question. Still, if anyone has heard of any studies on the topic, I'd be curious to get to know them. 

For normal people, a diet high in protein is NOT harmful. Its beneficial. High protein keeps you feeling full longer. Contrary to what I've read on this forum, your body can utilise (for energy, muscle growth) as much protein as you throw at it per meal. It is a great food for sustained energy levels throughout the day. A high protein (up to 50%) diet is popular with athletes around the world. As for protein in powder form, yes there have been some heavy metals found in them. Some fish also has this. Long story short, there is nothing magical about whey proteins so if you have any health concerns, eat more chicken/beef/eggs instead! Here is a great article from a very well-respected natural body builder (and power lifter) that did his PHD in protein metabolism. 

As your body adapts, your 100% will become faster and stronger. Your body will drop fat and you will build muscle in your upper and lower body. 

According to this article, Muscle growth starts about 1 hr after a workout and continues for up to 24 hours. It is important to have sufficient protein and slow release carbs to ensure maximum muscle synthesis. 

Add to that a quality fish oil, a multivitamin, and probiotics for digestive health. All weights are uncooked and 'meat' refers to anything lean (chicken breast skinless, lean beef mince, tuna, etc). Veggies excludes potatoes - just stick to green fibrous like broccoli. Protein powder must be low carb as possible (no sugar). Drink plenty of water (at least 3.5 litres) but not on top of a stomach full of food! Remember, its mostly about FOOD. As well as all this, you should be training about 3 or 4 times a week and HARD. Train every set to failure. Record your reps/weights and ensure you are always adding reps or weights (ever increasing intensity). There is a lot more to it all but this will be a good start. 15-20 reps on the compounds like squats and deadlifts will burn the most fat whilst growing (or at least maintaining) muscle. Forget cardio - and forget situps. It sounds like you already have a grasp on listening to your body. At first you will feel like you are forcing food in and intuitively you will feel like you are eating too much. This will quickly change as your metabolism gets up a gear. You will enjoy sustained energy levels throughout the day. Good luck. 

I know it's conventional wisdom that muscle mass is dependent on food intake. If you don't eat big, you won't have big mass gains. I'm wondering, however, if the same is true for strength. For example, if I consumed the upper-limit for the daily recommended protein intake for body-builders but did not consume a lot of calories (~2500 calories) would strength gains be impeded? I've seen skinny guys at the gym all the time lifting an incredible amount of weight, so I'm wondering the extent to which strength is attenuated due to diet restrictions. 

I'm wondering if there is any study that compares two groups doing identical exercises, except that one group has fewer rest days than the other. I have seen a lot of conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of rest days, with some studies arguing that your body needs rest to grow and to decrease the risk of injury, and other studies showing that virtually everyone can substantially increase workout volume and achieve positive mass returns from it. Essentially, I want to know the best ratio of exercise to rest for mass. Has anyone seen good academic research on this subject? 

There have been dozens of questions asked about the best way to maximize muscle mass. Consistently, the highest rated answer suggests focusing on whole-body compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and shoulder presses instead of split routines. Routines like StrongLifts 5x5 or Starting Strength, it is argued, will produce much greater strength and mass gains than a split routine. I was wondering if there is any actual research to confirm compound exercises are more effective at muscle hypertrophy than split routines. I'm all for the simplicity of Starting Strength, but I always feel like I need to add in bicep curls or tricep extensions in order to feel like I'm getting the most out of my workout. 

With the other nonsense removed, all we have left is to gain some muscle. You may want to stop gaining muscle when you reach your 'aesthetic' ideal. Great. You will have PLENTY of time to stop as gaining muscle does not happen overnight - or without hard work. Actively aim to lift MORE every set. More reps or more weight. If you aren't lifting more in any way (reps/weight) then assume you haven't grown muscle and immediately take a good hard look at your diet (are you eating enough?) or your intensity (are you really pushing yourself to the max). Remember, to put on muscle you need to become a bigger, stronger version of your current self. Your stronger future self will be capable of lifting a lot more than you are lifting now. Break this ultimate goal into smaller goals (rep/weight targets). If you are lifting to failure your reps will look something like 12,10,8,6. If you have been capable of doing 4 sets of 12 it means you were really lazy on the first 2 sets (or perhaps too preoccupied counting the time it takes to rep up and down). Advice 

I have successfully reduced my body fat from 15% to 8.5%. Keep in mind these are pinch tests so the over all body fat calculated percentage might be a bit off. My abdominal skin fold measures 7.1mm. I eat 3000 calories a day and whenever I try reduce this, I lose muscle (which results in an identical or worsened overall body fat percentage). Its almost as if my body doesn't want to lose any more fat. I don't do ANY cardio - just hard & heavy (to me at least) weight training 4 or 5 times a week. What cardio should I try putting in (assuming that will get me down)? Anyone tried and had success with intermittent fasting? I'm ALMOST happy with my physique. I would hate to come all this way and not achieve a full shredded physique. Here is a picture. You can see that blob of fat where the bottom 2 abs should be. 

One possible difficulty I see is overtraining, a physical condition where your body - either as a whole or specific muscle groups - is been put under too much or too frequent stress for an optimal growth path. Too many reps, too low intensity If I were you, I would start training much less and in turn increase intensity as described here by Jeff Cavaliere. The reason is the following: If you're doing 5 sets a 8 (?) repetitions of any exercise, you put too much stress in terms of duration and too little stress in terms of intensity on the muscle. If you can do 5 sets of 8 pull-ups, for example, you would be much better off, doing 1-2 sets of 6-8 weighted pull-ups (say, 5-10kg). The additional training time you put in does not help, it may even harm your gains. Too few rest days The second aspect is rest time. As I understand, you switch exercises every other day. This is very good in the beginning but as you get more experienced and since you already have been training consistently for a year, your muscles will need more time to adapt. I cannot say whether that stage is reached for you but it is something you should definitely keep in mind should you see that your gains slow down considerably. Running My last point is about your running training. You write that you run 1-2 miles every other day. This is okay as long as you are having fun with it but it is not clear whether it achieves anything. Endurance-wise it would be more effective to just go running once a week but then for at least 40-50 minutes. (It is the same too many reps, too low intensity-principle here.) If you are running only 1-2 miles because you want to increase your speed, it would be better if you did one interval (say, half a mile fast for 5 times with breaks of slow running between) training session per week rather than 7 1-2 mile sessions. But here it's really about your goals/motivation for the running sessions. 

The exercise famous for being hard on the knees is the leg press - not squat. If the squat is done with the correct depth (hip lower than the knee) so that the change of direction is NOT done while the knees are at right angles, it shouldn't hurt the knees. If you get some soft knee wraps you might be able to convince her to squat with those. If not - I would highly recommend lunges holding dumbbells. They train similar muscles. 

I also have had varying levels of rotator cuff pain over the years. Most of the time for me its been from bad technique on bar bell bench press, or dumbbell shoulder/bench press movements. There are many ways you can isolate and train (very carefully!) these muscles. I have always found a pain free shoulder strengthening exercise to be the seated barbell military press. I don't really like the smith machine version but that can be a way to start and learn the movement. Give it a try and see if it works for you. I've built up the strength in my shoulders substantially doing seated military press and rotator cuff pain has diminished and largely disappeared. I've also used this method sporadically throughout the years. I must admit I've been a bit lazy with it though but see how you go with it. Its the one generally recommended by most personal trainers whenever you mention rotator cuffs. More to your question on dips, they can be a bit tricky as muscles utilised can change (as you've identified) depending on your posture during the movement. If you want to strengthen your triceps for dips, I would recommend replicating a similar (but more controlled movement) in the rope pushdown. Hope that helps. 

While there is no point in giving you medical advice online and no one can say whether it is normal for you, it is nevertheless possible (though not necessary) that the causes behind your elevated heart rate are natural. Several studies, some of them referenced in Schuenke, Mikat & McBride (2002), have shown that human metabolism is much more active, even hours after the strength training. This results in a phenomenon called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). In a period for hours after the training the body will need to replenish body fuels (synthesize ATP), repair any damaged (muscular or other) cells, balance hormones and so on. All of these tasks require more oxygen intake than normally and this can lead to an elevated heart rate. (While the last inference seems logical to me, note, that I cannot provide scientific evidence that EPOC must lead to an elevated heart rate). In short, one reason behind your pulse being higher than your pulse at rest could be that after a workout your body is not at rest. It is busy repairing and re-fueling your body! Additional note: There is still a lot you can learn from your heart rate and monitoring it can be very informative. You just need to keep in mind that you have to compare your heart rate to other situations where you body was dealing with similar stress (and not to your heart rate at rest). If you do so, a high heart rate can be a sign that the training was more demanding than usual. It could also point at an approaching illness and be an indication of overtraining. Nevertheless, you should always seek medical help off-line.
