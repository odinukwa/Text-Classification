Let $(M,g)$ be an almost flat Riemannian manifold with boundary, i.e. we have $diam(M,g) \leq 1$ and curvature $K \ll 1$. Let's suppose $M$ is diffeomorphic to $N \times [0,1]$ for some smooth manifold $N$ with $\partial M \cong N \times \{0\} \sqcup N \times \{1\}$. Does the generic geodesic starting from one component of $\partial M$ eventually cross to the other component of $\partial M$ and thus exit the other side? Here I am parametrizing geodesics starting at one component of $\partial M$ by their entrance angle and asking for genericity in either the topological sense or the measure-theoretic Liouville volume sense. This came up because I'm constructing some Riemannian manifolds by gluing along almost flat pieces and carefully smoothing the metric, but I'm wondering if I actually need to be careful at all about this smoothing in order to get this crossing property. Edit: I'm open to taking a generic choice of almost flat metric as well, since some brief reflection suggests that the original formulation of the problem is likely false even for a cylinder... 

I have two quick questions that I've been having a hard time finding an answer to. Let $f^{t}: M \rightarrow M$ be a transitive Anosov flow on a closed Riemannian manifold $M$. (1) Let $\varphi: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a Holder continuous function. Is $\varphi$ cohomologous to a function $\psi$ on $M$ with $\psi(x) = \int_{0}^{1}\zeta(f^{s}x)ds$ for a Holder function $\zeta$? (2) The motivation for part (1): suppose that $\mu_{\varphi}$ is an equilibrium state for the time-one map $f^{1}$ with respect to $\varphi$. Is $\mu_{\varphi}$ the equilibrium state of some potential $\zeta$ for the full flow $f^{t}$? So to summarize, does working over the time-one map of an Anosov flow change anything when one looks at equilibrium states or potentials? I want to work with a potential over $f^{1}$ that's not obviously obtained by integrating along orbits. 

Although this seems quite reasonable, it does not hold in $V_{\kappa+1}$ (the successor of $\kappa$ is used for second-order logic) for the least worldly cardinal $\kappa$. This is quite a strange result indeed. In fact, $V_{\kappa+1}$ satisfies the Doubleton Ordinal conjecture iff $\kappa$ is $0$, $\omega$, or weakly compact. 

A common trend in large cardinal axioms dealing with critical points of elementary embeddings from $V$ into a transitive class $M$ is to make some large cardinal axiom with an ordinal parameter, similar to "$M$ is closed under $\theta$-sequences" or "$V_\theta$ is a subset of $M$". The resulting cardinals from these definitions are the $\theta$-Supercompacts and the $\theta$-Strongs. After this, expansions could be made to make the cardinal even larger; specifically, by taking that parameter of $M$ and making it $j^n(\kappa)$. When doing this to $\theta$-Strong cardinals, one achieves $n$-Superstrong cardinals. When doing this to Supercompact cardinals, one achieves $n$-Huge cardinals. Of course, a natural question at this point is to see what happens when one does it to $\eta$-Extendible cardinals. Here are the results: Let $\kappa$ be $n$-Superextendible if there is some ordinal $\eta$ such that $\kappa$ is the critical point of some nontrivial elementary embedding $j:V_\theta\prec V_\eta$ such that $\theta>j^n(\kappa)$. So far, here are the results: 

EDIT: I have since done some thinking on this problem, and realized the strong compactness cardinal of "normal logic" (as I called it) is at least the supremum of all strong compactness cardinals of all $\mathcal{L}_{\kappa,\kappa}^n$ for natural $n$ and cardinals $\kappa$. This of course means that, letting the strong compactness cardinal of normal logic be $\lambda$, the strong compactness cardinal of $\mathcal{L}_{\lambda,\lambda}^n$ is at most $\lambda$. Because of this, $\lambda$ must be extendible. This fact combined with the fact the the strong compactness cardinal of normal logic is at most the least extendible cardinal shows that the strong compactness cardinal of normal logic is in fact the least extendible cardinal. 

Let $G$ be the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group equipped with its Carnot-Caratheodory subriemannian metric $d_{G}$. Let $U$ be a domain in $G$ of the form $V \times I$, where $V$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $I$ is an open interval (so $I$ is the third coordinate in $G$ corresponding to the center of the group). I'm going to consider uniformly continuous maps $f: U \rightarrow V$. Let $H$ be the left-invariant contact distribution on $G$. Let $d_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}$ denote Euclidean distance on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. I want to consider a "quasiconformal" map $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}$ in the following sense: there is a constant $C \geq 1$ independent of $r$ such that for each $x \in U$, $y \in H_{x} \cap U$, $$ \frac{\sup\{d_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}(f(x),f(y)): d_{G}(x,y) = r\}}{\inf\{d_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}(f(x),f(y)): d_{G}(x,y) = r\}} \leq C. $$ In other words, for each $x \in U$ $f$ maps concentric circles in $H_{x}$ to quasiconformally distorted circles around $f(x)$. I want to conclude that if $A$ is a measurable subset of $V$ above with $m_{G}(A \times I) = 0$ ($m_{G}$ the Haar measure on $G$) then $m_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}(f(A \times I)) = 0$. So a form of transversal absolute continuity. Is this known? What makes me think this is true is that, if we replace $G$ by $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with the Euclidean distance with $H_{x}$ now being parallel planes orthogonal to the third coordinate, the conclusion follows from standard quasiconformal mapping theory on the plane + Fubini's theorem. Unfortunately this tactic does not work with $G$ because there is no foliation by transverse parallel planes. Note: Overhauled an earlier version of this question that was nonsense.
