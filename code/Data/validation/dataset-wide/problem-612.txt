If it were me, part of any upgrade would involve addressing the question of future-proofing the bike, for example so that parts going forward are easier to obtain. I'm afraid that, in your case, this means I would be looking at going beyond 9-speed. You mention 105/Ultegra and Dura Ace - well, these are all now 11-speed setups so straight away you're looking at hunting through back catalogues to source 9-speed parts in these groups. Unfortunately in Shimano's world, anything currently 9-speed is at the lower end of the spectrum, in terms of quality. You will still find plenty of 10-speed parts at the moment, but again, and with the exception of Tiagra, these are "old" in terms of Shimano's current range. Another observation is that triples seem to be nowhere near as common as they used to be, lots of groups bypassing them in favour of compact doubles. For what it's worth, I have a 3x9 bike (Tiagra mostly, from around 5 years ago) and every time I think of upgrading it, I put that project on the back burner. Quite simply it would be too much faff for not enough gain. I think my favoured upgrade path would be to go for a 3x10 105 group, with a view to then swapping in 6600 or 6700 (10-speed Ultegra) parts as things wore out. But that;s just a personal thing and, as I say, I have no appetite for that project just yet. 

I think probably swapping your wheels out is just about the single biggest improvement you can make to a bike in terms of performance. I did this last year and love the new wheels. I too was riding Aksiums (I think) and bought some Fast Forwards. Qualitatively I am very impressed (but then I should be, if you boil everything down to money the FFwds cost 5x a set of Aksiums). Quantitatively, its difficult to say how noticeable the change is. I didn't see my average speeds jump or anything, at least not enough to notice. (I certainly notice being blown across the road sometimes (6cm rims), but that I'm not sure that counts!) But now the caveat.....it all depends what you swap them for. I have no experience of Fulcrums so can't say how good that particular swap would be. Possibly someone else could help there. All I would note is that they're still toward the lower end of the price range (when you think you could spent thousands on wheels), so possibly they might not make as much difference as you'd hope. But as I say that's based on a hunch rather than direct knowledge. One other point: not so long ago I had a spoke go on the Ffwds. Was a real pain in the ass to get a replacement (they were fancy bladed DT Swiss spokes and you're always recommended to change like for like). Nobody in the UK could sell me just a handful of spokes, only a box of them at about Â£100. In the end I found a place in the US who would sell them singly, just for a dollar or two, but it cost in terms of delivery and duty. I'm just saying, whatever wheelset you get it might be worth making sure you can source spares for it easily. 

Nobody so far has mentioned a single-speed or fixed-wheel bike but if your commute is pretty flat it may be worth considering. The reason for going for one over geared bikes would be the added simplicity of not having derailleurs to maintain. I consider my fixie ideal for commuting - its steel so can handle a few bumps, and although I ride 23mm tyres (the roads in London are perfect!), I think it ships out of the factory on 32mm which should be quite absorbent. I can get into a decent position on it and (depending on traffic) can go at speed...also its great fun to ride. 

My daughter is 13 and it is only this year have we started looking at more "up-market" bikes for her - a hardtail (still pretty cheap by hardtail standards) and for christmas, a good-quality BMX. I am still unconvinced that she is old/responsible enough to take care of them, but we'll see... Up until then I have always gone down the "chain store" route. There are two main reasons for this: first, you have to be prepared for them to treat the bike like crap. And this is not just letting the bike drop without thinking, as Jilles says (although certainly this is true), but also things like leaving it out in the front garden, unlocked, on rainy nights to gradually rust or be nicked. Second, kids will grow out of bikes, and probably a lot sooner than it will take the bike to fall apart, even if made by a chimp. So you're not necessarily looking for a "well made" bike, you're looking for a "well-enough made" bike. Sure, the better its condition the easier it would be to sell on, but you'll never get big bucks for a second-hand bike now that people have eBay and Craigslist available to them. In the 5 - 7 age range I'd have thought the most important thing will be teaching them road sense and safety, so would have thought getting them used to peripherals such as hi-viz gear, a helmet and lights would be more critical than the bike itself. Bikewise maybe introducing them to a derailleur setup (we got a noddy 5-speed for my daughter at one point but she may have been older than 7) - obviously it is useful going forward for them to be familiar with this but also from my experience a kid will see a mountain where you or I would see flat road! But certainly I wouldn't rule out "chain-store-quality" bikes because, like I say, you'll probably end up throwing it away eventually. Though of course you may prefer to shop at your lbs if you have an existing relationship with them (and you want them to stay in business). 

You can in theory, but you'd need a to have a 9sp cassette, optimally (which might be your biggest problem), and be compatible with the rest of your drivetrain. You might also need to replace the rear derailleur such that it has a longer cage, to give you more clearance between the cassette and the actual derailleur. This range, as it's known, will be listed in the derailleur's spec. You might have trouble finding a 9sp cassette that goes up to 42T, but I'd be surprised indeed if you couldn't get a decent improvement on 32T. 

I don't know that you can do this with the apps you are talking about. However there is hope. Going back to first principles, you have a pc on which you want to create your route, and you have an android device which you want to stick on your bike and use for navigation. Correct? If you accept that you need to abandon Google Maps altogether, there are whole companies such as RideWithGps who offer this kind of thing. You create your map through their site (as it happens one of the options is to use Google mapping, but there are other options too - including bike path mapping which may be useful for avoiding cars). You save your routes on their site, under an account that you create. I use this part of their service a lot and I know it works well. As regards tracking, they offer an Android app designed for exactly that. I have not tried it. I have a pay subscription with these guys and it didn't cost a lot. But I know they also offer a free account so you might be able to do what I've said for free. I know the Android app is available through the Google App Store but have no idea whether it costs. Probably worth saying that there are a bunch of known issues with using phones for this kind of thing. Two that immediately spring to mind are battery life (GPS and screen are always on) and a way of securing the phone to the bike without the risk of it flying off. In the interest of fairness, other companies which offer this kind of thing include MapMyRide and Strava but I only really know of these in passing - in particular I'm not sure how they handle the tracking side. Also Garmin Connect, which I know quite well (and you don't need a Garmin computer to use), and which also has a complementary Android app. Any of these might be better than RWGps in doing what you're looking for. 

You really ought to be contacting Giant about this, even if for no other reason than to seek clarification of their web page. The link you posted tells you that they are DT Aero Competition bladed stainless steel, and you don't have to look far on the DT Swiss web site to find these exact spokes. What your link doesn't say is the length of the spokes. For that, you'll either need to measure them or contact Giant. Note that there will likely be 3 different spoke lengths in play - front, drive and non-drive. As regards purchasing, depends how many you want to buy and how deep your pockets are. These spokes will likely come out of the factory in boxes of 100 spokes. If you're prepared to buy in this kind of quantity then I'm sure any DT Swiss dealer will be able to help you (assuming, of course, you know the lengths). Again, the DT Swiss site will help you there. However if you only want one or two spokes then this is more problematic, since most dealers aren't prepared to keep boxes of spokes lying around on the off-chance that they'll sell one or two every now and again. One source I've used in the past is wheelbuilder.com, which was a very pleasant experience (Ca to UK in around 36 hours). There may be other sources which are cheaper/more convenient, but these guys stock your spokes. But again, you'd need to tell them what lengths you need. 

Pear Nipple I'd like to understand more about them. Why have two designs evolved? Does one (for a given type of bike (or brake?)) offer advantages over the other? Or, is it all just "marketing"? Lastly, are there any other designs in common use? Thanks. 

These days, using clipless pedals is very common, although there is still debate as to whether it is the most efficient setup. Terminology is also confusing here - strictly speaking this type of pedal is called clipless, yet we talk about "clipping in" and "clipping out". It sounds a bit silly at first, but something you soon get used to. Clipless pedal systems use a special pedal, plus something called a cleat. The cleat is is attached to a special shoe, designed specifically for road cycling, using some bolts, and the pedal and cleat basically bind together to secure the foot. For the most part, cleats will fit any road-cycling shoe, but there are exceptions here so it is something you need to check. Where the options come in here are as regards the pedal/cleat combination. As you might imagine, several companies have come up with different takes on this. I will not give an exhaustive list of these companies, but to name a few, the mechanism was first developed by the French company Look (as soon as you take an interest in pedals, this name is unavoidable and they are still big players). At some point later, the world's largest cycle component manufacturer, Shimano, got in on the act with their SPD-SL mechanism. As I say, there are several others. But to stress, these mechanisms are much of a muchness in terms of what they do, so choosing one over another is mostly down to personal preference. As you might imagine, though, one manufacturer will deliberately make their cleat/pedal tech different to other manufacturers, so in general you can't mix and match brands. (Although there are exceptions here too, you see some "Look Keo compatible" cleats on the market). But generally, this incompatibility also applies to different ranges within the same brand. For example, Look have two ranges (Delta and Keo) which are totally incompatible with each other. So you can see, you do kind of get sucked into a particular choice.... Beyond this, still with clipless pedals, you can control how much you allow your foot to move on the pedal whilst riding. SPD-SL and the Look Keo range support this, possibly others too (as @JohnP says, this is called float, and there are other questions on this site that give you an idea why you might choose one float over another). So, yeah, a complicated issue. My own history was that I first bought into the clipless idea, then just plumped for SPD-SL on the grounds that most of the components on the bike were also Shimano! Nothing more scientific than that. I've since changed to Look Keo (because I bought some special pedals that required me to do so) but have noticed no practical differrence whatsoever. So, take your pick! 

Can you measure your cadence? (The answer to this is that you can, even if you have to resort to counting strokes and looking at your watch. But a computer will make it easier.) On the flat, try riding in a high gear and at a high cadence, as much as you are able. This should translate to lower gear / high cadence when climbing (which is what you want). A word of warning though, riding in too high a gear can cause knee pain, which isn't good. So you're basically looking for a threshold - the highest gear you can manage, while maintaining a decent cadence (say, 70 to start with, but ideally higher) and without it being painful. Something you won't be able to reproduce is the heat - climbs can get very hot as there often isn't much airflow. But as you say you're riding in Yorkshire that shouldn't be a problem ;-)
