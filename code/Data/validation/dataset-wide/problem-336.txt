Again? Many hominins may have been able to reproduce with each other, making them, at least, subspecies. Generally while there had been a diversity of hominins Homo sapiens have been the one species overall. This remains an open question. The theories and evidence are contested. 

Good old fashioned water vapor, that's H2O, will do the trick. At high altitudes incoming UV can split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen can in turn be ionized and form ozone. if the water content of the atmosphere is increased this will lead naturally to the formation of an ozone layer. Considering the OP wants a Titan-like planet with a clear sky it's worth looking at the cause of the murky skies of real-life Titan. 

Most research papers on wormholes consider the wormhole mouth will be at rest relative to the system responsible for its creation. In fact, both mouths of the wormhole will be there. One suggestion is that the wormhole mouths are given an electrostatic charge to enable them to be fixed to a carrier system. The wormhole mouths can be moved apart and then used for quick transportation through the wormhole itself. For travel to a distant planetary system one wormhole mouth would have to be transported there in a spaceship and installed at a suitable destination. Once this is accomplished, anyone can travel there via the wormhole. If the spaceship travels at a relativistic velocity the moving wormhole mouth will be time dilated. For example, if the spaceship has an average velocity of 0.99 c, the time dilation will be a factor of seven. Let's assume its travel time, relative to Earth, is seventy years and the spaceship departs today in the year 2017. It will arrive at its destination planetary system in 2087, but for anyone here on Earth looking through the wormhole it appear to arrive there in 2027. This will enable people on Earth in 2027 to pass through the wormhole to the distant planetary system in 2087. This saves having to wait until 2087 before travelling there. This all due to special relativity and how it affects moving a wormhole mouth relative to its other stationary mouth. 

"Is this kind of organism even possible?" No, because it couldn't evolve. Ninety percent of life on planet Earth is microscopic, protozoa, single celled organisms. There would need to be an extensive ecology, a complete biosphere, before complex, multicellular organisms could evolve. Even the evolution of space-based microbes would be mind-bogglingly improbable. It might take trillions of years to happen. This is just getting to first base in the evolutionary stakes. It's going to take even longer for multicellular organisms like space nets emerge. The proposal for this creature involves that gathers space dust. But without explaining what or how this space net creature is able to do this. Without specifying what the space dust consists of, there is no way of knowing what the organism will need for it to grow, reproduce and move. The creature needs to be made of something in the first place. Depending on what it is made of will determine how much energy is required for it to assimilate material, digest and constitute that matter into its 'flesh'. Space-based lifeforms will only have access to minimal amounts of energy. There is literally microscopic amounts of matter available for them to consume. 

The obvious cue to start from is the phrase "the Second Economy". Assuming this refers to the economy based in the outer solar system embracing Uranus, Neptune, possibly Saturn too, ice dwarfs like Pluto and Eris, and the rest of the Kuiper Belt with an eye to colonizing the Oort Clouds, then this suggests that the most likely gas giant planet is Neptune. This far enough away from the hugger-mugger of the First Economy which holds the inner planets and the Galilean moons of Jupiter in its clutches. If it's close to the Sun, it's too close the old economic order and political hegemony of the First Economy. The orbit of Neptune is able to embrace the outer planets, providing a safe location for their data traffic. A long way for the fusion-propelled gunboats from Earth and the Mars and Venus colonies to go if they want do some old-fashioned sabre rattling and flash waving, Admittedly there will be long delay times for communications. But that is normal for that region of space. This does raise an interesting question(s): how and why has your uploaded personality been uploaded to the outer planets settlements/polis of the Second Economy? What are or were their intentions? 

Because the moving masses in a gravitational wave transmitter will be so high, this makes sending gravitational waves effectively impractical to the point of being impossible. The receivers of gravitational waves are gigantic precision instruments and likely to be on such scales into any foreseeable future. More information about them can be found here. As for imposing data on existing or passing gravitating waves probably also requires the manipulation of stellar scale masses. The same problems discussed above will apply. However, in principle, if a sufficiently advanced technological civilization existed that could routinely manipulate stellar mass objects capable of generating gravitational waves, then they could use gravitational waves as a communications medium. This seems to be too big a step for any civilization and they would be able to access easier methods for communicating data. 

The Athar are creatures of living stone. This makes effectively indestructible and, possibly, immortal (this last point is left for the OP to decide conclusively). Therefore, it is highly improbable there would be any creatures, animal or humanoid, living on their continent who could harm them. This suggests they have been living in peace for millennia. The one exception could be conflict within the Athar community itself. The Athar would have no experience or knowledge of fighting other humanoids. Normal humans would be no threat to them. Perhaps they only fight in self-defence. While this is laudable, it does make them vulnerable to organized aggression by the influx of humans who have had to flee their devastated home continent. There is a parallel situation with the European settlement of Australia. The indigenous Australians didn't feel threatened by European settlers, because their initial numbers were small. The Aborigines had the advantage of bush craft, local knowledge, and had superior numbers. By the mid-nineteenth century when the Aborigines realized there was a threat, it was too late especially with the influx during the Gold Rushes. The Europeans now had the superior numbers plus they had acquired bush craft and local knowledge. Also, firearms had improved considerably. Diseases and alcohol had also had their toll on the Aboriginal population. This parallel situation suggests that if the first settlement of the Athar continent was slow and progressive, the Athar wouldn't feel threatened. Later there was a sudden influx of humans to overrun the Athar lands. The hitherto peaceful Athar might lack the ability or even the determination to fight against the humans. If the humans leave the Athar alone, the Athar in turn might let humans get on with their business unmolested. One other possibility is that the numbers of the Athar have always been small. This will mean a mass human migration to their continent would soon outnumber them. Since this is a world where magic exists perhaps the humans have magical weapons to use against the Athar. For examples, jewels imbued with a magical power to turn living stone into ordinary stone. Once the magic gems are taken away the Athar become creatures of living stone again. However, while they are lifeless and helpless their stone bodies ca be destroyed. This suggestion may be inappropriate for your world. It might suggest useful ideas. In summary, the Athar might not become the dominant race because they have never needed to become warriors. Even when humans are dominant, unless attacked because they can defend themselves, they will leave humans alone. 

A civil control system like this won't suddenly pop up whole and entire of itself. The different elements of the system will be developed and improved until they represent mature and reliable technologies. Currently many of the technologies and systems to do what your hypothetical civil control system does are under development and are being implemented to considerable effect. By 'considerable effect' that means they work and are suppressing political dissent and civil disobedience. By 5000 it can be expected these technologies will be far superior to anything we can imagine today. If the society is on a war footing it will be remarkably easy for a society to implement a civil control system. For the greater good, of course, and for the duration of the war, naturally, but once implemented it will be extremely hard to undo. During the time of war, societies have implemented much more draconian systems of social and political control. A future society, during a galactic war, would have little difficulty implementing a civil control system. Social and political protest could be readily suppressed. Systematic implementation would soon roll up any opposition. Dissents can be detained and processed to become part of the system. As for the hardware needed for its implementation, this only needs to be locally. In cities, regional areas, or even for whole planets as this circumvents the need to control the populace across astronomical distances. Using FTL communication this can update the requirements of the system in terms of who and what needs suppressing or controlling. Just like software updates really. Doing it locally means only locally-based servers and devices are needed. To control and maintain such system effectively would require the development of AIs capable of exercising legal and moral judgement at approximately same level as a human being. Considering software agents and algorithms are capable of writing legal documents, searches case law, and more accurately diagnosing heart aliments than human doctors, improvements in software and hardware should make a civil control system relegated to the level of an easy to install system by the year 5000. Never forget there are a lot of ordinary citizens who would welcome reliable, incorruptible and all-encompassing law enforcement to make their lives safe and well regulated. Already people tolerate mass surveillance with CCTV especially if it makes their lives safe. Current systems aren't effective enough to do that well, but when they are effective and reliable a civil control system will be welcomed. During the introduction of such a system, which won't happen in one fell swoop, it will be done in stage and in small steps with all components in place for its implementation at least a millennium or three ago. Then it will only be a matter of integrating the systems to form one all-encompassing control system. With sufficiently advanced technology that might only involve giving a few orders or passing a few laws. It would be that easy by fiftieth century.
