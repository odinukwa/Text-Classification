If you have ever had to fight with lighting in a video studio, you will know the frustration that ensues because your eye is self adjusting for white balance. When you look at he scene in real life, whites are white. Look at it on the video monitor, and everything is red because of the tungsten lights. After an adjustment period (a few minutes to a few hours) your visitors would perceive colors exactly the same as a native. 

With a meteor of that scale, the least of your worries will be the EMP. The energy of impact will instantly vaporize the meteor itself and an equivalent mass of the earth's crust. The shockwave will be felt around the world as major earthquakes. Portions of the mantle may be exposed briefly, a large mass of sulfur will be vaporized. The heat of impact will cause fires across half the world. Molten rock fragments will rain from the sky around the world for days. In short, I feel no amount of concrete can protect you from the simple mechanical damage. Defense against EMP effects, in contrast, is simple. It requires a solid metal casing around the electrical and electronic systems. 

If I understand the question correctly, you're wondering how to label the effects on human mentation of manifestations by Cthulhu and Its ilk. Insofar as Lovecraft himself is consistent about this -- and he is certainly never systematic-- the poles of the effect seem to lie between sanity-blasting destruction and a kind of semi-effective denial. This leads me to suggest something like "destructive rationalization" as a general term. In Lovecraft's fiction, it is usually the imaginative, educated, intelligent observer, normally one with an aesthetic affinity for experimental and avant-garde fine arts, who risks full sanity destruction. This is because such a person, in Lovecraft's world, is able to understand with some clarity even phenomena that range well beyond apparent possibility. By contrast, the "lower" sort of person -- less educated, intelligent, cultured, sophisticated, (white), etc. -- can always use superstition and raw stupidity to blur away what he or she perceives. Faced with anything less than a full-on manifestation by Cthulhu -- say, some Deep Ones or the like -- all too soon this person's mind bends the perceptions. "Wall, they wuz this fish thang, real ugly-like, an I guess I don't keer to see another." This person may find that social support from like-minded persons, alcohol, and a total lack of intellectual or aesthetic stimuli will lead eventually to a full resolution and recovery, apart from the odd hideous nightmares. In essence, the difference is whether one is capable of rationalizations that actually distort and destroy the remembered stimuli. Byakhee becomes giant bat thing becomes tall tale, as it were. The intelligent, sensitive, cultured white male, however, cannot do this. Indeed, he actually roams mentally beyond the stimuli, seeking to account for them, and realizes just how impossible such an account might be. Thus it is not so much what a Deep One looks like as what its very existence implies that is ultimately so sanity-blasting. So I suggest "destructive rationalization." Note that there are, I believe, Freudian terms for this kind of memory-encysting, in which the trauma is sublimated and expelled from the mind, but I don't recall his work thoroughly enough to remember whether he discusses permanent suppression of this kind as possible. But his terminology would certainly be the place to look for something more authoritative. 

Lower Canada. George Washington was in the campaign that took it from the French for Britain. Later, in the revolutionary war in the alternate history he took it from the British as a 14th original colony. The impacts would be immediate and dramatic, as the fledgling USA would suddenly have a french speaking majority. the whole fur trade economy, and double the land that it had in real history. Edit: To explain why this results in 51 states If we started with 14, and much of history unfolded in a similar vein we'd be at 51 today, but we might speak french and have more of a code law system. 

I learned to distinguish between lucid dreaming and reality by deliberately focusing on areas of my body where I knew there wold be pressure if I was sleeping. If I believed I was standing up, but I felt pressure on the backs of my calves, then I was dreaming. From a mechanistic viewpoint, such a VR system is stimulating the brain either directly or indirectly. For this discussion, eyepieces and VR suits count as "indirectly". However, whether the mechanics are direct or indirect, you can always apply stimulation easily, but can't prevent it easily or block it proactively. Therefore, your VR experience will always be a blend of reality and what the VR operator wants you to see. The VR operator will do his best to limit the sensory input from the real world, but absent suspending the victim in an orbital facility there would always be something to cue off of. 

In the history of magical or occult thinking, one finds that things are rarely taken as themselves: they tend to be in relation to other things. When we say "correspondences," this is really what we mean -- a correspondence is properly a relationship between two things that is embedded in a larger system or web of such relationships. Thus object A is like object B because both share property C that is considered to be a quality, aspect, effect, or sign (or all of these) of principle D. As a result, the real question here is about classification. While it is true that Nature herself does not classify Australian and European plants together, that's because Nature herself does not classify anything. We do, as observers, on certain more or less defined or formal bases. For example, we classify some plants as "grasses," and there are complex and serious reasons for doing so, much debated and so forth across the last couple of centuries. Under that system, there are "grasses" in both Europe and Australia. Either those plants are or are not "really" connected in terms of your magical correspondence system, which leads to a deeper matter. It appears, from the description of power level allowing looser correspondences, that correspondence classification is an intersection between the magician-subject and the natural-objective phenomenon. This means that there is some way in which things are or are not "really" linked, at an underlying, natural, non-cultural sort of level. And there is also some way in which that kind of linkage is actually forged, created, signified -- in a word, made -- by the human observing subject. If this is correct, then there is no absolute sense in which two things do or do not correspond: it's a matter of interpretation and knowledge. In which case, to resolve the difficulty within a fantastical world of your creation, you may need to come up with a formal conception of "natural correspondence," i.e., that type of relation that preexists within nature just because, and which is in some fashion a prerequisite for magical manipulation. 

Heavy equipment can only take you so far. Coincidental with Iraq war, there was a move to stop bayonet training for US forces because it was expensive and unlikely to ever be useful. Needless to say, when there was a steady two hours of bayonet work for platoons moving into Baghdad proper from the newly established base at the former international airport, the movement silently disappeared. US forces have the highest tech around, having superior firepower, air cover, tanks, and other vehicles. Neverthless, they had to get boots on the ground using 18th century techniques to take the city. We saw the same in Fallujah, and Mosul. The same theme played out in Vietnam. Ultimately, it requires boot on the ground to take a position. Airpower and ranged weapon support can augment ground troops, but cannot replace them. 

Prevent warm and cold fronts from meeting - not likely on a planetary sized body. Prevent shear winds when the warm and cold fronts meet - not likely. You have two continental scale masses of rotating air meeting. That pretty much defines shear winds. Prevent the shear wind tubes from merging - this is air we're talking about. The blast of a tornado feels solid when it hits because the relative velocity of the wind to yourself is high. But the tubes of shear winds have low relative velocity to each other so they mix freely. Prevent air from moving in to replace what was displaced by the updraft - Not likely without a lot of forewarning. Remember tornadoes are weather patterns that form in a chaotic system. While formation is not random, the pattern is too complex to afford reliable prediction. 

Deep underground, there's a huge limestone cavern, roughly 50m x 100m. It's 250m deep, and completely filled with still water. There is a very small inlet, but the system is now effectively closed, so it appears to be a vast underground lake. Now down at the bottom, there's an ancient stone door, 4m on a side. Using a magical bomb of sorts, the heroes blow this door off its hinges. On the other side is nothing to speak of -- the water can flow out freely and descend well below the bottom of the chasm/lake. 1) How long will it take for the lake to empty? 2) Will the emptying process accelerate over time, building up an increasing vortex, or remain basically steady? The water can tear the door-frames to bits as it races by. 3) What will this all look like, seen from the shore of the lake above? 4) The walls of the cavern are dressed elaborately -- think of the great gate of Petra, all the way around, halfway up the sides. What will happen to these sculptures as the water races out down below? Note: If this belongs in some sort of fluid-dynamics SE, please direct me there. I figured it's such a broad hypothetical, especially the part about the Petra-like carved facades, that it belongs here. 

Moved from comment to answer because I've done more research. Try the biblical account of Sodom and Gomorrah, believed to be near the coast of the Dead Sea . The cities were destroyed by means of volcanism (fire and brimstone), and 4000 years later we still don't know where they are for sure. As an argument for the effectiveness of this approach, there is even debate as to whether the cities actually ever existed. The Dead Sea region is (in)famous for its sulfur (brimstone) smell. One of its names over the centuries was "The Stink Sea" because of it. While the region has been tectonically active in the past, there are no active volcanoes in the area in recent times. Igneous rocks are the norm around the dead sea, as are old volcanic craters. To achieve your ends using this example, you are looking for a pyroclastic volcanic event that has a sudden onset, creates pyroclastic projectiles sufficient to smash stone and clay homes to rubble, but does not have an associated lava flow or leave a new crater. It must maintain a temperature high enough to cremate bodies, but not so high as to fire the clay into ceramics, without deoxygenating the atmosphere for sufficient time to allow thorough cremation of the bodies. A short lived lava plume, which originally powered the eruption, sits beneath the two cities, raising their temperature for the duration of the event. This is distinctly different from pompei, where the environment was preserved by ashes and lava flow. Edit: Summary of some concerns raised in comments The veracity of the biblical account is not part of this discussion. For that, go to one of the religious (Christianity, Judaism, etc) or archaeology SE sites. This is not an attempt to prove that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by volcanic activity. It is an observation of a recorded event in a real location (Dead Sea valley) that matches the OP's question, and uses the real world geology of the area to establish a plausible natural event that a deity could use in the manner that OP requested. Setting aside the questions that are bigger than this discussion and off topic for worldbuilding, this event comes to mind because: 

Remember that the fine details are irrelevant, but their consistent application will give a little flesh to the bare bones. And because the system is actually, behind all the window dressing, essentially identical to what we’ve been using for the last 3000+ years, it will all seem eerily comprehensible even without explanation. 

The short answer to your question is "yes, of course." Two societies that come into contact, assuming that they are able to communicate, will necessarily have an exchange: communication requires this. To put it in Star Trek terms, the Prime Directive is idealistic but utterly impossible: the only way not to influence another society is not to let them know you exist. On the other hand, there is no reason that one has to think of such contact in catastrophic terms. To be sure, the history of European colonialism is not a pleasant one, but that needn't be the sole model. Consider, for example, the many, many tribal peoples of the Americas, prior to the arrival of European invaders in the wake of Columbus (let's ignore the Vikings here). They talked to each other, traded with each other, sometimes fought and sometimes didn't, for an extremely long time. As a result, we can spot remarkable affinities among myth-cycles all across the Americas. If we had better longitudinal data than we do, we could chart how customs and such moved; in some cases, we can do this to a degree, especially when it comes to material culture (pottery, beadwork, etc.). You cannot possibly model all of this, of course: it's ludicrously complex. But there are a few points that could perhaps be useful in a fictional worldbuilding context. 1. Variable Usage and Interpretation Suppose one culture has a big thing about hats, where there are all these incredibly fine variations and gradations in hat shape, style, material, color, and so on, and these are a complex sort of code having to do with social station, age, sex, place of origin and/or residence, and so forth. (At various times China has had some of this kind of thing going on.) Now along comes the other culture, and they do some peaceful trading for a while, and this other culture takes home pictures and souvenirs and stuff in addition to actual trade goods. Now at home, they might end up with a big fad for "alien hats," and suddenly the millinery industry is going through the roof. Of course, this culture either doesn't understand the hat-code system, or doesn't understand it well, or just as likely, sort of understands it but doesn't really care: the alien code doesn't apply, but the hats look cool. 2. Reinterpretation But maybe that second culture, after a brief fad about the alien hats, finds itself in a situation in which everyone is wearing weird hats all the time. They have the concept of the alien social hat-code, but it's an alien system that doesn't match their own life-patterns. It could well happen that, over time, this society develops a way of coding hats that does match their life-patterns, particularly if they're constantly trading with the original hat-wearing aliens. 3. Rejection as Adaptation And then a new thing sweeps our society: hat-coding is an alien thing, and it's contrary to what we're really all about (because of the gods, or pride, or whatever). So people stop wearing hats entirely. Before alien contact, they sometimes did and sometimes didn't wear hats, but it didn't mean much: it was a fashion thing, or maybe a way to keep the rain and sun off. Then there was this fashion surge, and then this new hat-code, and now nobody ever wears hats. I realize that this may seem like a silly set of linked examples, but the point I'm trying to make is that cultural contact and adaptation is both extremely complicated and to a significant degree non-catastrophic. While it is obviously possible for "contact" to mean "convert them at swordpoint and then enslave them," it usually doesn't work that way. Usually what happens is that objects, customs, images, and so forth are exchanged, and then each culture has to make sense of the new stuff in its own terms, which in turn changes that culture -- but not necessarily to make it any more like the one it's exchanging with. Here's a final example, in this case from real history: Melanesian cargo cults. Cargo cults are (mostly were) complex and varied, but the basic phenomenon is revealing and helpful for the question at stake. To give a highly simplistic account of one type: During the Pacific War, the American navy (especially) sometimes provided various goods to local Melanesian tribes. In essence, the idea was to get these people to be friendly to Americans, such that they could be enlisted to assist against the Japanese; for example, they might tolerate an airstrip, or they might tell Americans about spotting Japanese ship movements, or whatever. Now when the war ended, so, pretty soon, did the providing of free stuff. Now the problem is, a lot of Melanesian societies base their economic systems in social exchange. Think of it sort of like The Godfather: if I'm a big powerful dude, that's not because I have a lot of goods, but because everyone owes me favors. And to retain and increase that power, I have to keep people owing me by giving them stuff and not letting them pay me back. For my birthday, I'm going to throw a huge party and invite everyone, and I'm not only going to feed them but I'm going to give them all presents. This both demonstrates and increases my power. So for these Melanesians, the American goodies represented a problem. The Americans gave them stuff, but didn't accept anything back. So this meant that the Americans were incredibly powerful. But when they just stopped giving stuff, what were the Melanesians supposed to do? They owed favors, but now the folks to whom they owed the favors wouldn't talk to them. So in these cargo cults, you'd get a millenarian religious movement centering around the Americans and their stuff. People built wicker airplanes, put on wooden headsets, and generally did anything they could to force the American "gods" (loosely speaking) to restore the relationship, not necessarily because the Melanesians wanted or needed the stuff as such, but because this gross absence threatened the whole system of exchange itself. If you do a little research on cargo cults, and think about what's happening on the two ends of the exchange, you'll end up with a very wide range of ways to think about cultural adaptation. 

This started out as a comment but got too large. I'm just going to touch on points that the other answers have not touched on in the way I would have stated them. People with engineering and chemistry backgrounds tend to have a general curiosity about the world in general, so their professional training doesn't decribe their knowledge or skill boundaries well. Even in the 20th century, it was hard for a woman to make a mark in the world. My own mother (a chemist) developed one of the first latex emulsion paint formulations for a national brand, to the pre-production stage, then the project was turned over to a male chemist because women weren't allowed in the plant. In the medieval period, anything to do with the kitchen and food would have been a good place for a woman to make a mark without challenging the social boundaries too much and being burned as a witch. Some form of canning is feasible. However, mason jars are not feasible because mass manufacture of precision glass jars was not feasible. However, the same effect (sealed sterile storage) can be had with pottery jars sealed with wax and topped with waxed leather. By leveraging her new reputation for food storage with heat, a pasteurization process could be worked out. Blacksmiths had worked out methods for maintaining steady temperatures. Those methods could be adapted for the much lower temperature of pasteurization. If she has been playing the part of a strongly religious (Proverbss 35) woman, then her rising reputation for the handling of foodstuffs would allow her to introduce crop rotation. Crop rotation was practiced in ancient mesopotamia (6000 years ago), and could be explained to medieval folks as a religious observance for the pious farmer, expanding upon the direction of Exodus 25:10. Silvering was known as early as the 10th century, although it was not used for mirrors yet. I'm not a chemist, but my mother was, and I spent much of my childhood around chemicals. One of her college exercises was to silver glass to build some other instrument. I believe a modern chemist should know enough to figure out the technique of silvering glass for mirrors (although medieval glass wasn't that flat, so I suspect the bronze mirrors would have been better) In my edit I changed "would" to "should" because of this story. About 20 years after my mother retired, she got a panicked phone call from a lab she used to work at. They were disposing of old chemicals an had found a squirt bottle labeled "hydrogen hydroxide". After she stopped rolling on the floor she walked them through the exercise of translating the name into a formula. "H-OH" "Yup. Now reduce to simplest terms" "H2 .... oh < click >". They had stumbled on to one my distillled water bottles from when I washed dishes at the lab (35 years previously). 

The intelligence does not entirely understand the human perspective. To It, all time is one instant, so It knows what we call "the future" only as something else in Its total understanding. As a result, the questioner is unable to communicate his question to the intelligence effectively, and the reverse. The intelligence and the questioner communicate through the clouded mind of another person. In all likelihood, constant direct contact with such intelligences has damaged the prophet's mind. Alternatively, that mind was already damaged, which is why it is open to such contact. Yet again, the process of making the mind function for communication requires deliberate damage. As a result, communication contains a great deal of noise to relatively little signal. The prophet or sibyl does not know why the questioner is asking the question, and as such, the words don't mean much in themselves. "Will I win the war?" could mean a lot of things (which war, win in what sense, I meaning me personally or my side, etc.). The prophet has to project this question as a kind of total notion to an alien intelligence. The process requires the prophet to enter a trance, in which the conscious mind is significantly suppressed. As a result, the question may or may not be communicated accurately. The prophet or sibyl may have to work at a remove from the direct contact, through cards, sand-cutting, ink swirls, etc. The process of developing some sort of meaningful correlation between the question and the so-presented objects, qualified by a dim impression of the intelligence's own Presence, produces very problematic results. If nobody is asking a question, the prophet is simply seized by images, and has no idea to what they might refer. She sees pictures, hears sounds, and tries to describe what she thinks they mean. Others may study her descriptions and try to reformulate them as predictions. But the end-result may well only be comprehensible after the fact.
