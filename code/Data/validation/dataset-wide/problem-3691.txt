It is far easier to make wiser eating choices than to exercise off poor choices. Your 50 minute workout barely covers the few minutes it takes to eat a Big Mac (not that I'm saying you eat Big Macs). By eating quantities of foods delivering a low Glycemic load, it is quite easy to take in less calories in a day and not feel hungry or feel like you're too restricted in food choices. You also get the benefits touted by lower carb diets such as reduced fat storage, reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The main problem with working out that time is that you may simply run out of time to do it, or simply be too tired. Maintaining that workout every day just to lose a pound a week will be tough on the will-power. 

I'm currently squatting twice a week, deadlifting once. Deadlifting doesn't concern me because I feel my back is getting a great workout and the hips are starting much higher than the knees, but squatting I'm fearing too much of a leg workout. My legs are already way too big compared to the rest of my body and more than capable strength-wise for everyday activities. In fact I'm sort of glad I'm up around 20-22% body fat now, as when I was 15% my legs looked just too muscley for my liking. I'm not into the bodybuilder look. I'm squatting bodyweight (100kg/220lbs) currently, not much by any means, but I've just started training (5 weeks) and it's jumping up 10kg(22lbs)/week, with 2x5, 1x5+ worksets. I feel I have quite a way until I start stalling. By comparison, my work weight on the bench is only 60kg/132lbs, shoulder press 48kg/105lbs and they're not shooting up with double increments like the squats/deadlifts, rather 1.25kg/2.5lbs per workout at best, sometimes failing to complete the final set. I'm up to 80kg/176lbs on v-grip pulldowns and doing lots of chin negs as I can't yet do a single chin-up! I'm doing the squat as recommended in Starting Strength/Stronglifts. Does an alternate form minimising quad and hamstring development exist? Might it be preferable to substitute in power cleans for one of the squat workouts? Or are there other really good total body exercises not primarily working legs? 

History The first time I started a strength program I found I could slowly lose a bit of fat during training. Training partner stopped, so did I and I lost a lot of fat (and bit of muscle). Looked good. Training partner ready to go again a year later so I've started lifting again. Current Problem After 2 months, I'm just turning into the Barney Rubble type - a tank - strong and solid but the fat's coming on too. There's no way the 12 pounds I've put on in 2 months is all muscle. My training partner is finding the same. Feeling My uninformed opinion is that my body is demanding a quantity of protein for muscle recovery and because I'm not taking supplements or focusing on high protein foods, it's making me eat more food to get enough protein. Wish I train because I enjoy it. I don't wish to start taking supplements, special diets or counting grams of protein. But I don't want to pile the fat on because my appetite's gone up. I'm the classic endomorph with wide hips, narrow shoulders so focus more on hypertrophy of upper body doing 8-12 reps for smaller muscle groups. I enjoy squats and deadlifts for the full body workout. Current program Greyskull LP, 3x5+, Bench (150lbs), shoulder press (125lbs), squat (290lbs), deadlifts (330lbs), V-grip pulldowns, barbell curls and pull throughs. 5-6 trainings per fortnight. Walking 10-12 miles a day, 5-6 days a week, which when I'm not strength training, tends to keep the weight coming off slowly but surely. Stats 6 foot tall, 45 years, currently about 235 pounds, ideal weight 210, get anorexic looking under 200. Question Should I start modifying my training or even have spells to allow me to cut some weight off? Followup to comments Diet: very well read on nutrition and base diet pretty good, just not a bodybuilder's diet. I'd only get about 100g protein a day. Carbs are not excessive unless I go all day without eating due to task urgency, and end up binging. I know I shouldn't, stopping it has proved very hard though. Training turns me into an eating monster. I suspect hill sprints will also cause me to eat more but I will try those. The only way I've been able to avoid becoming what I call 'Rippetoned' is by not training, where walking all day on the treadmill desk slowly but surely knocks off weight. 

I felt fulfilled. Workouts increase by mere minutes, equipment is not dominated unreasonably. 3 work sets don't get monotonous The number of reps achieved is like being told you got 90% in an exam as opposed to just being told you passed. It's motivational. AMRAP tests my real limit, for I can do no more. It's concrete. Without AMRAP, whether I wanted to do a 4th, 5th or even more was dependent on how long I wanted to rest. I see definite progression with AMRAP. AMRAP gives me a great carrot during the exercise, knowing I double my weight increment if I can reach 10 reps. With Starting Strength the carrot really wasn't there during the exercise as doubling an increment was more hazy and based on if you feel you can handle it. Unlike an extra set or two, the AMRAP set allows me to estimate my 1 rep max and follow my progress on the strength standards chart. It was motivating hitting the Novice threshold for those exercises with muscle groups I know I was weak in. It was exciting working towards the intermediate level for the deadlifts and although advanced is still so far off to have that motivating pull, the squat intermediate is here any week if all goes well (touch metal) so I usually seem to have some exercise getting me up at 6am and out to the gym. 

I quickly moved to GreySkull LP (2x5, 1x5+) because it solved many small issues I had with Starting Strength and StrongLifts. The 3rd workset in GreySkull LP being AMRAP was key to some of these issues: 

If you like running and just love to get out there, run. If you don't particularly enjoy it or it's too low a priority in your life, diet control is far easier. It will be hard to maintain jogging when time is at a premium, the weather is not good, or when the scales aren't rewarding you appropriately for the effort. Plus you have more chance of escaping plantar fasciitis, shin splints, tendinitis, ITBS, runner's knee, knee replacements, hip replacements and other hazards out there (a faulty manhole for instance required me to have an arthroscopy). 

Doing standing shoulder presses, I'm very cautious not to learn backwards during the lift. My training partner and I specifically watch each other for this. However even without weights when my upper body is upright, my lumbar region is already hyperlordotic. It's something I've been working on eliminating lately. Two days ago during my second standing press workset, something popped under my left shoulder blade on a rep I was having trouble completing and pushing too hard. It didn't hurt but it didn't feel right so I stopped the workout. That night was agony though, as was the next day, but it's getting better now two days later. During overhead presses, I can feel my core under enormous pressure, like it's trying so hard to stop that lordotic curve increasing. I'm currently shoulder pressing 125 pounds, which I've slowly worked up to in a 3x5 fashion, increasing 2.5 pounds each time. I failed to do three sets of five the previous week at the same weight, managing only 3, 5 and 5. I warm up before lifting with about 15 minutes of Cressey/Robertson's Magnificent Mobility mixed in with some hip flexor stretches and foam rolling. Should I go to seated presses, fix the hyperlordosis or strengthen something else before doing presses again? Or simply not strain too hard to finish a tough rep? 

I use a Starting Strength type warmup for squats, deadlifts and presses: 2 x 5 x bar weight 1 x 5 x 40% working weight 1 x 3 x 60% working weight 1 x 2 x 80% working weight (Apologies to other programs if SS inherited it, it's just where I first saw it). However I tend to round the squats and deadlifts to the nearest 5kg, the presses to the nearest 2.5kg, thinking there's no exact science to warmups, just don't tire yourself for the working set. So even if my work weight has increased only slightly from the previous workout, the cumulative work done in the warmup sets, or volume, could jump abruptly due to the quantization of rounding Enough to affect the working set significantly? 

Creating a program It will be unlikely that existing programs will cater for your exact needs, so rather than following one to the letter, check out a few respected programs, pick the appropriate bits out that coincide with your goals and ask questions here or elsewhere if needed. For example, I started reading but thought starting at an empty bar was taking 'motivation through success' and technique training time too far. The marketing of it doesn't sit well with me either. hit the sweet spot with the starting weight IMO so I swapped over to it and found the book and videos of each exercise, something Stronglifts lacked, extremely valuable. however didn't look like it would address my goal of adding mass to my upper body, but from it I was lead to , a variant that did address this. One of the core exercises in is weighted neck extensions. I asked about the benefits of such an exercise, I didn't value those benefits, so dropped it. I use the warmup and starting weights from and many things like increments are common between the two. I use the resets from GreySkull LP. I plug-in the appropriate additions to GreySkull LP in accordance with my individual goals. Keeping Track of progress I tried a few of the top rated Android apps, including JetFit Pro, and hated them. Too much unwanted stuff, too many keystrokes and mucking about, and they didn't do what I simply needed. Commercial programs have to appeal to a wide audience so are bloated for any one user. So I just used an Excel spreadsheet on Dropbox and use it with OfficeSuite on Android. 

I did my second deadlift routine today but didn't increase the recommended 15 pounds from the first time as I'm purposely limiting growth by only having a caloric surplus on my workout days. Instead I increased by 5kg (10 pounds), but found I got through the set too easily. So then I popped on another 2.5kg (5 pounds) and did another set. It seemed about right as I doubt I could have finished 5 reps if it was any higher. The book however says it's easy to overtrain deadlifts. I'm already a bit scared of that because I'm deadlifting each workout until I can alternate with power cleans. So did I do the right thing by increasing the load until it felt like I got something out of it, or better just walk away and wait until next workout?

She gave them back. So I now use them along with the Motorolas. Their wireless reception is brilliant, I use them when cleaning the house as I don't have to carry the phone. I use them when walking the dog as power lines don't affect them. I use them at the gym. I use them where I may later have to take them off and carry them in a pocket, as the Motorolas are too bulky for pocketing. The Motorolas however do not feel bulky when wearing them. I don't use the Plantronics GOs for jogging, they simply are not secure enough to handle the bouncing. Another massive design fault of them is the rubber connecting cord between the buds--high friction rubber catches on the back of your neck when turning your head and can pull the buds out. That could have been so easily eliminated with smooth plastic. Sometimes I wonder if any companies actually use their products. Having the cord across the front instead of the back helps this a lot, but now gets in the way of activities more. These two devices together would make the perfect device. Maybe the later version of the Motorola, the S10, is much better, but the reviews still seem poor. A problem with headphones is, because of hygiene, I never found a place that would let me return them if they were no good. One may have better luck in the States, but you may have to just take the gamble, try them, because it seems like people either love them or hate them. Wireless headphones have a long way to come, but are definitely feasible at the moment. 

I had read to use both mouth and nose, but found that whereas the nose is good at filtering air, it's not very good at filtering the water droplets splashing around. Water up the nose isn't nice. I ended up buying Total Immersion's "O2 in H2O, A Self-help course on breathing in swimming" and it teaches in with the mouth, out with the nose. 

In a world with "Don't" signs everywhere, if it's a problem with your gym then there will be a sign up saying not to drop. All my local gyms have the sign, but they are upstairs of other businesses. They also have thick mats in the free weight area but do not have bumper plates. I wouldn't be concerned with death stares from other gym goers if there's no sign. I would however investigate whether dropping the weights is recommended for the exercise, as most of the dropping I see appears to be for attention seeking purposes. I can't recall seeing a little skinny guy dropping a 20kg dumbbell after setting a new max, it's always 40kg+ jobs by beasts followed by a very pumped prance around the gym. The noise however is quite startling to those unaccustomed to it, so use rubberised dumbbells or bumper plates if there is a choice, and lift over the thick mats. 

I can appreciate the skin gets looser with age, but can't see that affecting the measurement, if this diagram below is correct: 

Adaptation is a bastard. I walk 8-15 miles a day, 5-6 times a week, while doing a strength training program 3 days a week. I feel my body has worked out how to walk effortlessly, such that the calories burnt are definitely less than activity burn sheets might imply. I keep a caloric deficit non-workout days, a slight surplus training days. Fat loss seems to be so much harder now than before I started the strength training. I feel the recovery from a workout leads me to sleeping more, eating more and less inclined to do varying types of energetic work. The large amounts of walking (which has also reduced by about 30% since strength training) just can't seem to compensate for the occasional 1000 calorie surplus bad binge day. I remember the weight I'd lose going on a 3 day hike walking around 7-8 miles a day. But I'd only hike once or twice a year (no adaptation), I'd have a heavy backpack (as Berin suggested), plus tough hills. 

Micro carb cycling, as described in Tom Venuto's Holy Grail, sounds feasible. Essentially putting your body into a caloric surplus on your workout day, and into a deficit the days between workouts. Also trying to get a lot of your protein and caloric requirements directly around your workout, with other meals during the day much smaller. He suggests a 3-1 ratio (3 days caloric deficit, 1 day surplus) when the primary goal is fat loss, secondary strength gain, and a 3-(2-3) ratio (3 days deficit, 2-3 days surplus) when the primary goal is strength gain, secondary fat loss. 

A 20 year old male with 25% body fat has a 35mm measurement, a 56 year old with 25% has 17mm. So the skin getting thinner as we age (if it indeed does), isn't significant. Do we accumulate fat in other, healthier places than is predicted by the suprailliac as we age? I say 'healthier' because the colored bands in the chart above shift their ideals as we age. 

After starting with StrongLifts (5x5), then moving to Starting Strength (3x5), I also found I wanted to do more. It's common advice in the former two to just do the sets and go home, you don't have to kill yourself, be patient, strength will come, you'll stall soon enough... That didn't however ease the feeling of not making the most of a workout--I'd rather smell the roses in nature than in the gym. I mucked around with doing an extra set or two with Starting Strength, but of course some of the same issues I had with StrongLifts came back, i.e.: 

At the gym, there is no scrolling, no menus, no screen changes, no button presses except for entering the reps achieved in the final set or two in the orange boxes. I'm not battling with tools, nor at their mercy when they change the way they do things in an update. I can instantly see my previous weight and reps achieved, which weight I have to put on each side of the barbell, plus I don't have to think about warmup weights - they're calculated automatically and rounded to easy plate combinations. If I go to a different gym and they have a 20kg barbell instead of the 17.5kg ebay job at my normal gym, it's catered for. That's all I want for instance, nothing more, nothing less.
