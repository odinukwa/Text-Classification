In the proof of Eric Naslund: I would like to add few more things. I like the answer of Eric. As Eric pointed out $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{x-\alpha_i}=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{1}{x-\beta_i}$ if and only if ${Q}^{\prime}(x)=0$. What I want to say is ${Q}^{\prime}(x)$ may or may not have solution. And so, one may or may not have solution of $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{x-\alpha_i}=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{1}{x-\beta_i}$. For example: Take $m=1$ and $n=2$. one has ${Q}(x)=\frac{(x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)}{(x-\beta_1)}$. Then ${Q}^{\prime}(x)=\frac{x^2-2\beta_1 x+\beta_1(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)-\alpha_1\alpha_2}{(x-\beta_1)^2}$. So ${Q}^{\prime}(x)=0$ if and only if $x^2-2\beta_1 x+\beta_1(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)-\alpha_1\alpha_2=0$. The real roots of this depends on the choice of $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta_1$, which makes discriminants greater than or equal to zero. I have considered an elementary case, and still hope for finding roots is so dificult. In general, It seems difficult to find solution of $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{x-\alpha_i}=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{1}{x-\beta_i}$. However, theoretically answer lies on the roots of ${Q}^{\prime}(x)=0$, but practically, It seems hard. 

For any $n$ tuple $f_1,f_2,\dots,f_n$ in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n]$ one has Jacobian, expressed by the $(n \times n)$-determinants: $$ J(f_1,\dots,f_n):=|\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}(f_j)|_{1 \leq i,j,\leq n} $$ And, one has for elementary symmetric polynomials $e_i$ of degree $i$, $$ J(e_1,e_2,\dots,e_n)=\prod_{1 \leq i,j,\leq n}(x_i-x_j)=\triangle $$ also for complete symmetric polynomials and power sum symmetric polynomials, one has a very nice formula for Jacobian, see the following link: $URL$ Question: Let $n \geq 4$. Is the similar results also known for minors of Jacobian of symmetric polynomials (complete symmetric polynomials). Remark: For power sum and elementary symmetric polynomials, one can derive easily, I am looking for complete symmetric polynomials. 

Theorem 2 follows from the list above, together with the Classification of Finite Simple Groups. There is very likely a nicer approach to some of the simple group stuff than what I do above -- I'm far from an expert. (Maybe one of the real experts around here can remove the possible exceptions from the statement!!) I found the slides linked here of Maxim Vsemirnov on (2,3)-generated groups very helpful for understanding the exceptions to (2,3)-generation. In particular, he has a list of groups that are not (2,3)-generated on page 15 (which he conjectures to be complete). I've verified with GAP that all are (2,$q$)-generated for some prime $q$, except for the PSp's and $\Omega_8^+(2), P\Omega_8^+(3)$. Corollary: The conjecture holds for any $G$ with a maximal normal subgroup $N$ such that $G/N$ is not one of the exceptional (small) classical groups in Theorem 2. 

UPDATE: The original poster of the question, together with Mamta Balodi, have shown that the labeling I suggest below is an EL-labeling if and only if group (product) complements coincide with lattice complements on the given Boolean interval in the subgroup lattice. The latter condition does not always hold; in the same paper they present examples where it does not. The Cohen-Macaulay and/or shellability questions still seem to be open in general. Unless I'm mistaken, this is (up to sign) the Möbius number of the poset $C(H,G)$ formed by all cosets of all groups on $[H,G]$, together with an artificial $\hat{0}$ element. This is because the Möbius number of a Boolean interval is $\pm 1$. Thus, your sum is really $$ (-1)^n \cdot \sum_{H \leq K \leq G} \mu(K,G) \cdot [G:K].$$ The Möbius number observation I made now follows from definition. I believe that $C(H,G)$ is Cohen-Macaulay. Since the Möbius number of a Cohen-Macaulay poset of height $n$ is positive or negative depending on whether $n$ is even or odd, this would give you the desired positivity. There are lots of ways to prove a poset to be Cohen-Macaulay. One way would be to construct a dual EL-labeling. I think that you can do this as follows, but have not written down a proof. (Edit: the following works some of the time, but not all of the time; see UPDATE above.) Label the bottom edges $\hat{0} \lessdot Hh$ with 0. Let $M_i$ be the join of all $K_j$ except for $K_i$, so that $M_i$ is maximal in $[H,G]$ for any $i$. If $Y = X \vee K_i$, then label $Xh \lessdot Yh$ with $-i$ if $Xh = Yh \wedge M_i$, and label $Xh \lessdot Yh$ with $+i$ otherwise. Now verify (assuming it is actually true) that every interval has a unique increasing chain that is lexicographically first, as required for an EL-labeling. The labeling that I suggest here is extremely similar to that constructed in Section 4.2 of my paper "Cubical convex ear decompositions". The observation that the quantity you're interested in is a Möbius number is attributed to Bouc, but is in a paper of Ken Brown, "The coset poset and probabilistic zeta function of a finite group". The latter is rather well-written, and also discusses some other ways of computing the Möbius function of the full coset lattice. 

I will attempt to answer my own question. I hope someone will point out any obvious error. Notice that statement (1) is true in all finite models of MA, the rings $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ . Statement (1) can only be false in an infinite model of MA and all infinite models of MA are non-standard. Let $G(n) = Ex( (x \neq 0 \land x+x=0 \bmod n) \lor (x+x=1 \bmod n) )$ Let $M_2$ be a model of PA that has $Z_2$ as a definable initial segment. There exists $x \in M_2$ such that $G(x)$ is false. Since $x$ must be non-standard, $M_2$ can prove itself non-standard. If PA is consistent then no model of PA can prove itself non-standard. $Z_2$ can not be a definable initial segment of any model of PA. I find this result surprising. If valid, this shows MA has models that are not definable initial segments of any model of PA. 

I have been studying a theory I call Modular Arithmetic (MA). MA has the same axioms as first order Peano Arithmetic (PA) except Ax( ~S(x)=0 ) is replaced with Ex( S(x)=0 ). MA is consistent because it has arbitrarily large finite models base on modular arithmetic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem proves MA must have infinite models. MA can be made into an ultra-finite theory by adding an axiom like Ax( x=0 or x=S(0) or ... or x=Sn(0) ) where Sn(0) is some finite number of applications of successor to 0 (a numeral). Coming up with a set theory based on MA is problematic. It is simple to show MA is omega inconsistent. The predecessor of 0 must be non-standard (not a numeral) in any infinite model of MA. If the predecessor of 0 is standard we can prove the model is finite using induction. This means Ax( ~S(x)=0 ) is true for all standard natural numbers in any infinite model. A set theory based on MA can't be well ordered or well founded, either. (x =< y) <-> Ez( x+z=y ) is trivially true for any x and y. Using S(x) = x U {x} as a definition of successor is inconsistent with the axioms of MA. In ZF, even the Axiom of Pairing allows the construction of arbitrarily large sets. Assuming we could come up with a set theory for MA, it would have the properties you ask for. One way to do this would be to encode sets as binary expansions of natural numbers. Element x is a member of the set if the x'th bit of the expansion is true. This would allow us to have sets of size log2(n) where n is the size of the universe. We can equate 0 with the empty set. We can define singleton sets for "small" elements of the universe. We could also define sets with subsets. We could do a reasonable amount of arithmetic by choosing n large enough. We could have sets and do math on sets as large as 100 by having a universe of size 2^100.

This lets us handle $A_6$, which has maximal subgroups of index 6, 10, and 15. If $ab = 60$ then either $a$ or $b$ is divisible by one of these. 

It is not clear to me that the homology chain $D$ in the definition of the Hopf invariant need be a disc. This would be the main obstacle to proving from the above theorem that a map with Hopf invariant 1 is not null-homotopic. (If I understand Hopf's map correctly though, one can indeed take the homology chain to be a disc here. Since this is the only example in these dimensions, requiring $D$ to be a disc might be within the boundaries of good taste.) It would be nice to have a direct combinatorial proof of the above theorem. The main obstacle is seeing how the interior of the simplicial $D^4$ yields an interior of $D / \partial D$. (If you can understand some 3-dimensional interior of $D / \partial D$, then I guess it'll follow from Sperner.) 

You could get a little more involved with (2), and check for positive $h$-triangles of every link in the complex, since a link in a shellable complex is shellable. In practice, when I've had complexes that I've wanted to computationally check shellability on, I've generally found the combination of the two approaches to give me an answer. You can either first check for obvious non-shellability with (2), and if everything is positive apply (1); or else first check shellability with (1), and if the computation appears to hang, then look for a negative entry in the $h$-triangle. (But this works for me partly because the complexes I look at usually arise from some kind of "nice" combinatorial object or process.)
