I think your best option is to change the crank. A 2015 Deore or a SLX crank are not only extremely good value for money but they also carry a lot of modern technologies (search the net for reviews, everybody loves them) comparing with your old 2002 product. A modern 2015 Deore (cheapest, entry level) works much better than a 2002 XTR because 13 years of development really make a big difference. Good luck and happy riding. 

I can't precisely tell you which one you need with a picture, and I didn't find a good one in the internet. The bottom bracket you need is either an OctaLink or a Square bottom bracket. You should be able to figure out just by looking at your bike. Before buying you need to check both the shell and the spindle lengths, as you can see here. It is really easy to remove and install a new one, but you will need to buy a crank extractor and a bottom bracket removal tool. These aren't tools you will use very much so just get the cheapest ones you can find. You will also need generic tools to unscrew the crank, but you can figure these ones out. You can find detailed instructions on how to do this here, or just search for a youtube video. Before installing the new one grease the hell out of those threads so it won't be a pain to remove next time, and because that part is very exposed to the elements. Stupid elements! 

There are a couple of downsides to overly long hydraulic hoses. The most obvious issue is that you end up with excess tubing that may get snagged if you don't tie it off securely. Another less obvious issue is that hoses expand slightly as the pressure in the system builds (i.e. when you squeeze the brake lever and apply the brakes). A longer hose means that the overall increase in volume is greater and you end up with slightly less effective brakes. That said, it's usually a minor difference in bicycle brakes so it's not the end of the world if you ignore it. 

While it is likely that most velodromes feature rotational symmetry and many of those will also feature reflective symmetry this is not a requirement for a UCI homologated track. 

With the rims brakes your bicycle use I would say there is no way you can change the wheel to a smaller diameter. But that is not a problem. You say last time you rode a bike was more than 10 years ago, and it was a different type of bike. It makes sense that you find it hard on this new bike, because more than it being different, you haven't been doing it for a while. I ride bikes on a daily basis and if I change my bike to a friends it takes me some time to adapt to the new bike. This is normal, and is more true as different the bike is (for example, road bike to mountain bike). There is a chance you have bought a bike which is bigger than it should be (bikes have sizes), but this should also not be a big problem. If you give me your height and your frame size I can help you though. I would however say there is nothing wrong and you bought an excellent bike, you just need to train a little bit. Lower your saddle to a comfortable position, and spend an afternoon training in a big, traffic free area. You will see you will re-learn your skills and be comfortable in no time. Happy riding and remember, don't forget you helmet :) 

The pictures included make it clear that the caliper housing should be slightly offset to ensure that as the fixed inboard pad wears and the rotor flexes it does not contact the caliper housing itself. This would lead to damage to the rotor and/or the caliper. You should probably still follow the manufacturers recommendations for your given brake model, however aligning the caliper to have more space on the fixed side then aligning the pads evenly would also be suitable if you are unable to find specific instructions from your manufacturer. 

From your description it's likely that the pawl responsible for upshifting is seized and not engaging properly. The reason it would be able to shift the first two gears is because for the 1-2 shift the pawl face engages with an edge of the ratchet wheel instead of a tooth and since the trigger moves far enough that you can shift over two gears at once the 2-3 shift is possible using the same mechanism. To fix this you would need to remove the cover and clean out the old grease using a solvent or degreaser, or even something like PB Blaster or WD40. You'll probably need to move the pawl back and forth to work the old grease out from around the shaft the pawl rotates on. Once the pawl is moving freely (ie, it snaps back against the teeth without hesitation) apply some fresh grease and put the cover back on. This video describes the problem and fix, at about 1:08 you get a clearer shot of the upshift pawl and ratchet wheel. Most shimano rapidfire plus shifters use a variation of this design, even if you have a different model than depicted in the video you should still be able to clean and regrease the mechanism the same way. 

If you like these things you can rebuild the suspension. You have detailed, easy to follow instructions from Rock Shox here and you can buy a rebuild kit also from Rock Shox, here (please confirm these two match your suspension). You won't spend too much on tools (some you can borrow maybe?), or at least you won't spend much more than your local shop will charge you. The tools you buy you can reuse on the next service, you will end up saving a lot of money by doing it yourself, and it goes for a nice afternoon with beers and friends if you're into that. 

You choose a non-trivial project. Lots of good tips have been given, but I must warn you: restoring an old bike is not a to-do list like I have seen here. It's not like maintaining a new one. There are all sorts of difficulties with old, seized components, that will be a pain to unmount, and which will require a careful evaluation before rebuilding. If you feel lost among all the information, and don't want to read an entire book, the head mechanic of park tool (famous bike tools company) did a project a while ago where he described a step-by-step project similar to yours, on restoring an old bike, with very detailed information on each step. Some of the components/difficulties he had to deal with are certainly different from yours, but his detailed instructions and videos are a really good place for you to start, you will learn a lot by watching them, and they are really easy to follow. You can find it here. Doing this should be a lot of fun with your friends and a few beers, so enjoy the process and good luck! 

UCI Regulations for Track cycling provide a very loose definition for velodromes (see page 75) even up to the Olympic level. The only strict requirements beyond track width and markings are that velodromes must be 133-500m long (250m exactly for Olympic events), the track shape should consist of two parallel straights connected by two bends and that there is a smooth transition between the straights and the bends. There is no requirement for a consistent radius or banking throughout each bend. There is no requirement that the straights should be the same length or relative elevation either. Exact dimensions of various velodromes are difficult to find, however to give one example How the velodrome found its form features an interview with the engineers responsible for the velodrome used for the London 2012 games where they note: 

The user in this forum reports long carbon wheel use with no need for truing, and DTSwiss also recommends the same maintenance interval for carbon and aluminium rims regarding checking if the wheels are true, which is an hint to them being similar. The main problem with carbon, and this is also true for carbon components in general, is that despite being stronger than aluminium it is also more rigid, which means they don't respond as well to sharp impacts. Think of it as a steel vs an aluminium nail: the first one bends easily but holds the structure, while the steel one is very tough but breaks all of a sudden. This is also said in this interview with a pro bike mechanic, that says carbon wheels are faster because you can maintain your direction better (more rigid), but have overall less durable because in an accident or impact they are more likely to require substitution. He even says that it is normal for costumers to try both types and prefer aluminum due to their compliancy and comfort. Getting back to your question, I would say that due to the compliancy and flexibility of aluminium they hold dents and impacts better, as these are just killers for carbon rims. As the mechanic in the interview says, to which I agree, Carbon wheels are an expensive luxury. I personally would easily buy carbon components for my bike with the exception of the wheels, as these components in particular are very likely to have to sustain high impacts due to low tyre pressure, trying to go up a sidewalk or a bad measured bunny hop. We have all been there :) Edit: You guys are right, I just threw it here :( I will try to improve. 

SRAM's brake setup instructions for BB7 brakes (select user manual from the service documents, step 10 in the user manual) specify that the inboard/fixed pad should be further from the rotor than the outboard/moving pad. The ParkTool instructions that @jimirings links in their comment are specific to this model of brake and repeat the manufacturers instructions in this regard. Other manufacturers provide different advice, for example Tektro's instructions for their mechanical disk brakes (TRP Online Resources - select "All Spyre and Spyke models" from the road disc subheading under the user manuals section, Tektro Mechanical Disk Brake Owner's Manual, or Tektro Support > Download - select "Mechanical Disk Brake - User Guide") specify that the brake pads should be evenly spaced on both sides of the rotor. The Montague blog you've linked to use a Tektro Novella brake but repeat the instructions given by SRAM, not what Tektro recommend. Neither manufacturer give any reason for the specific alignment, the only reference I could find was the following section from CX Magazine's article How to: Set Up & Adjust Mechanical Disk Brakes: 

As @Slovakov said, these kind of protections are never seen in XC, the main reason being that XC is a low risk activity. You usually go at slower paces and you never put yourself in situations where there is a likely chance you can loose control and have a high speed crash in a dangerous zone (as you do in downhill or freeride, for example). Of course you can fall and hurt yourself, but you can fall and hurt yourself if you are trail running, you can twist an ankle if you are playing basketball, or hurt a tendon weightlifting. You have to understand physical activity isn't without a certain degree of risk. The only reason why helmets are highly recommended is because, even in the unlikely event of having a crash, an impact in your skull can have huge consequences for yourself - much more than any other part of your body. Also, if you are concerned with your safety, it is my belief training yourself and learning to ride a bike in a technical situation is a very valuable skill. Lower your saddle, move your ass right to the back, learn to control and feel your brakes, etc. Start with easy areas and progressively advance to places which are more rocky and have more inclination. Being comfortable around these situation plays a big part in your safety. With that said, if you still want knee protection, the most lightweight I know of are POC VDP Air Knee and Elbow Pads, Dainese Trail Skins or Race Face Charge Leg Guards. Six Six One also makes pads with various densities. You will easily find all of these with a Google search. Have fun and safe riding :) 

There are a number of commercial products available to move bottle cages up or down from the existing braze-ons. They're marketed as a Bottle Cage Relocator or Bottle Cage Adapter, but essentially they're all a flat piece of metal with holes drilled into it that may have some finishing work to make it look nicer. Given they're in the $10 range it's probably a better use of your time to buy one than DIY. 

As @Paparazzi said it appears to be a Gitane bike, from looking through the product catalogues on the Gitane USA site I suspect it's a 1984 Gran Tour (from page 5 of the french catalogue) as this style of logo appears to have only been used for the early 80s and this model is the only model that has the bar end shifters/is advertised in the same colour. 

It depends what kind of lock you have. If it took a thief a failed attempt I assume it's a good one, so take it to a locksmith or anyone with power tools, preferably with a proof of ownership of the bike. The harder it is to destroy, the more convinced you should be that you should buy the exact same lock again :) 

As you can read in Shimano's North America homepage. So if you bought this new, go there and complain. Disc brakes with proper maintenance should last for a few good years even on an daily usage basis, and Shimano's are known for their reliability. If you bought them used or did something you shouldn't (incorrect oil for ex), you can try to get them fixed, but since they're around $35 each, lever and caliper, I'de just buy new ones.
