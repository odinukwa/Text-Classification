The Soviet Union was a famously restrictive place when it came to news and ideological spin, and obviously their attitude toward the United States was less than supportive and warm. The Space Race saw a lot of competitiveness between the two countries, but when the United States landed a man on the moon, the language they used was very universal. They phrased it very much as a victory "for all mankind," and there was a lot of talk about all people on Earth being "one." Of course, that's easy to say when you just won the race. What was the internal Soviet response to the news? Did the Soviet citizens know it was happening at the time? Was it spun as a victory for humanity, or a victory for the United States, or a loss for the Soviet Union, or what? Was the story reported accurately, or were details changed in the retelling? 

Following and expanding on from Mike L's comment the short answer will be we don't know. Numbers of armies as quoted in works at or close to the time were often (always?) exaggerated, you know our guys only had 10,000 and the bad guys, they had a 100,000 and we still beat them. Camp followers and townsfolk could also get lumped into the count regardless of their combat effectiveness or drain on resources. The other thing to remember is the main people counting were the heralds. And their job was to note the demise of important people Sir XYZ, Monseigneur EFF, Landsknecht Von D, The Kings Brother/Son/Nephew etc. A small part of the fighting force but well worth a ransom. The bowmen, crossbowmen pike-men, halbadiers and the townsfolk were in their opinion worthless so rarely counted or counted accurately. I mean why bother when no-one cares? I suspect to get any sort of answer you would need to look very carefully at the information available about the size of armies, remembering that because of logistics most medieval armies could not usually number more than 20,000 except in exceptional circumstances and make your own estimation of the size of the armies and then with more difficulty try to get estimates of the size of towns taking into account no real census data being available and populations fluctuating by season or plague. No doubt here tax and poll records would help but are still open to interpretation. 

Are there any design elements that symbolized the Carthaginian empire? The Roman empire is associated with many iconographic and stylistic elements, like the golden eagle on military standards and banners, the bright red tunics and draperies, a very recognizable legionary armor silhouette, the curved red/orange shields, etc. Each of these are very evocative symbols of the Roman government and military, similar to the bald eagle or the stars-and-stripes for the USA. The game Rome: Total War associates Carthage with the colors blue and white and a symbol of a crescent moon, but I haven't found many other references for either of these so I imagine they're just game design elements. Most of the religious symbols tied to Carthage are equally tied to Phoenicia and other areas of the Mediterranean. I'm having a hard time finding any symbols or designs, whether military or governmental or religious, that are exclusively and evocatively Carthaginian. Were there any seals or standards or designs or colors that evoked "Carthage" in the minds of people in the ancient Mediterranean? 

I am of the opinion that your assertion is flawed. Merriam-Webster simple definition of Historian: a person who studies or writes about history Merriam-Webster simple definition of History: the study of past events. : events of the past. : past events that relate to a particular subject, place, organization, etc. MacMillan Dictionary definition of Historian: someone who studies or writes about events in history Oxford English Dictionary definition of Historian: An expert in or student of history, especially that of a particular period, geographical region, or social phenomenon Oxford English Dictionary definition of History: The study of past events, particularly in human affairs: "medieval European history" The Wikipedia Entry of Historian says: 

There is a terrific site, Legends Of America. It goes into pretty good detail about the history of the Old West, including noted people and vices. In its discussion about the real Gem Saloon of Deadwood, South Dakota, owned and operated by Al Swearengen (made famous in HBO's Deadwood), it mentions that 

The Romans, during the time of the Republic, were a famously anti-monarchical society. There are plenty of stories of Roman politicians gaining favor by refusing crowns, or condemning kings, etc. As I understand it, even the first emperor Octavian took the title "princeps" or "first citizen" so as to seem more palatable to the people, who might not have taken kindly to him openly declaring himself "king." But at a certain point, you just have to face facts. Succession struggles, inheritance, single rulers who stayed in power until they died, there is only so long you can go before you start to think, "you know, the princeps sure looks like a king..." When did the Roman people finally acknowledge that their Emperor was, in fact, an Emperor? The Senate continued to be a going operation for centuries, but how long did it take for the public to admit that they effectively had a king now? 

If you meet the enemy as they begin to cross, they may halt their crossing, preventing the attack. They may fire at you from the far shore. If you let only as much of the enemy force as you can handily defeat, cross the river, you can easily defeat them while the reinforcements attempt to cross to their comrades. This is a form of "divide and conquer." 

When White men came to mainland North America, there were an indigenous population already here. I will refer to that population as North American Indians. Africans were brought to the Americas (eventually) as slaves. Talk to an average White man in the South, point at a group of Black men (African Americans, Negros) and he could be expected to think "slaves". Why didn't America (or the English before the American Revolution) think of (or write laws to the effect that) the indigenous North American Indian population as slaves? NOTE: I'm not asking why didn't they enslave American Indians, just why didn't they view them as (think of them as) slaves. 

Famously, when Columbus (and several other European explorers) landed in the New World, they thought they'd reached Asia. Hence, for example, our use of the word "Indians" for the local peoples. Even those who didn't believe Columbus's claim of being able to sail west to Asia must have questioned their beliefs for a moment: after all, he'd landed somewhere, and where could it be but Asia? Eventually, though, it became obvious that it wasn't Asia, and the European powers got down to business exploring and claiming and colonizing and such. But what exactly tipped them off? What were the things they pointed to and said, "I don't think this is Asia, because..." Were there Europeans who were well-travelled or well-educated enough to accurately know what China looked like, and to know that this wasn't it? Did they hear reports from the East along the lines of "We don't know who you're talking to, but it isn't us"? How did they know that the stories of magical lands to the East weren't simply exaggerated, or that they hadn't landed in a poor, unsettled equivalent of the Philippines, off the Asian coast? How did the Europeans deduce that they'd discovered a new continent, rather than arriving in Asia? 

I suspect the short answer to this is that we do not know for sure. The reason for this is that the evidence we have for what the romans wore is not their actual physical clothes as over the period of time i doubt if any roman clothing intact has survived as throughout human history until industrialisation clothing was handmade and so expensive (relatively) and usually worn until it literally fell to pieces. We do have scraps and fragments (see here). So the evidence for clothes is usually statues, mosaics and any wall paintings that survive such as those at Pompei of Herculaneum as well as any writing on the subject that survives. The case against was that Roman clothing was quite simple and sophisticated tailoring was not employed so the construction of a corset as such is unlikely. It is possible that individuals may have "bound" themselves with bandages as rudimentary device, but they would then hardly have this made into a statue to put in a public place. The only possible source of material could be Roman erotic art, of which there is a lot although some of it still partially suppressed where you are seeing the Romans at leisure but this does not appear to yield corsetry. Edit:- Someone has commented that i did not really answer the question but pointed to sources which is correct. At a distance of 2,000 years it would be hard to produce a definitive answer as evidence may yet be uncovered that would extend knowledge and reverse opinions. However if i had to give an answer then i would say no, Roman women did not wear corsets. From all the evidence that we currently have in statues, writings, drawings, paintings, mosaics, graffiti etc. there is nothing to indicate a garment that was like a modern or victorian corset. It is also the case that Roman attitudes towards clothes and clothing, the state of tailoring and engineering would not lend themselves to the manufacture of such a garment. And before someone tells me the Romans were brilliant engineers then yes they but a corset is not an aqueduct, or a ballistae or poured concrete 

It's important to remember that the concept of "white people" (or fair-skinned people) as a single, all-encompassing term for Caucasians is a fairly recent development. As recently as a hundred years ago (or even today, in super-conservative areas), "white people" meant Anglo-Saxons, exclusively. People as closely-related as Irish or Germans may not have been considered "white," depending on the speaker and the context. Plenty of empires in the south of Europe, such as Greece and Rome or Spain, held biases against their paler, northern "barbarian" neighbors like the Celts and the Germans. Even today, there are biases against redheads in many parts of the world. Terms like "pasty" and "pale" are almost always derogatory, so from a purely aesthetic standpoint there is a point at which darker skin is preferred over lighter skin in pretty much any culture. If you're looking for a culture that generally believed "the darker the better," you'll need to check the other answers, but there are plenty of periods in which the powerful majority had consistently darker skin than the oppressed minority. Just think back to the Julius Caesar's (Italian) conquest of Britain, for a famous example. 

In the earliest years of the newborn Christianity, scribes wrote on single sheets of papyrus, formed into scrolls, or birch bark sheets. Towards the end of the 1st century a.d., parchment, made of animal hides (the best type known as vellum, whose root is shared with veal, or calf). While papyrus did continue to be used perhaps as late as the 9th century, by the 4th century a.d., parchment had taken over as the writing sheet of choice. While the scrolls had sufficed in the beginning, as the tomes grew in size, it was discovered that many sheets of vellum could be bound into a codex, or book. As Europe descended into what is called the Dark Ages, illiteracy took hold throughout Europe. Even the leaders were mostly unlettered. Only the monastery remained truly literate, with monks acting as the scribes. Parchment, or vellum, was chosen for the books due to its durability, as compared to the much more brittle papyrus. 

In fantasy literature there are plenty of examples of cultures (such as the Dwarves of Lord of the Rings) who favor axes or hammers above swords in combat. Did any historical army follow that pattern? Obviously some people in any battle will have unusual weapons, and an angry mob will grab anything that's convenient. Some armies (like the Greek phalanx) also used pikes or other length-based weapons that reduced the need for hand-to-hand weapons entirely. But were there ever any armies where they fought up close and face-to-face, but where the standard melee weapon was an axe, a hammer, or something other than a straight blade like a sword or knife? I have a distant memory that Bronze Age cultures in the Middle East used some kind of sickle-shaped weapon, but I can't think of any after that.
