So in itself, the worldview expressed by the quoted statement is not coherent. By extension, this LEGO-brick like behavior of truth adhering to other truth applies to all propositions claiming truth, absoluteness, or coherence. Coherence itself is a function of truth with respect to other truth. 

There is no such thing as a paradox in nature. Paradoxes in logic often arise from removing the temporal element from reality, attempting to flatten the universe into a time-invariant model of truth. In so doing, time-varying phenomena which are possible in nature become impossible, i.e. paradoxical in our model. The limitations are in the model of using a flat logic to model higher-dimensional realities. Contradictions of this sort can be visualized in similar fashion as the impossibility of non-overlapping arcs in a K-connected planar or N-dimensional graph for certain infinite set combinations of K and N. Regarding whether a purported AI could achieve this same capability, it would have to rely on a model fully adequate to overcoming the shortsightedness of painting itself rationally into a corner using an insufficient model of reality. However, as we try to get a machine to approximate limitless human creativity, I believe it would be impossible to impute all of the wisdom and introspection regarding such blind spots without constant human intervention, model correction, and introduction of algorithms for handling such inconsistencies as they arise and become humanly detectable. 

Answer: He could say true or false. (That's what I came up with after thinking it through below) I'll give this a low effort shot. I haven't read anything by Lewis where he says one way or the other, but I'm steeped in Lewisian tradition, so maybe something Lewisian will emerge: As has been pointed out before, Lewis could avail himself to possible worlds to settle this. But you seem to have good textual evidence to think that that isn't the move he would make, so we can take that off the table. The other options are that it is true, false, or undefined/some other truth value. As far as I recall Lewis is not a fan of trivalent or otherwise nonstandard logics. That might have been a nice solution here, but it would really mess with Lewis's ontology. Given that propositions are sets of world you'd get such nasty things as sets of which some world is indeterminately a member. Definitely not an option for him. Hence, I assume that he would say that the sentence is either true or false, and that this is a matter entirely of how this world is like, not some other possible world. I think the final part of your explanation might give you a clue. From what you say it looks like what Lewis is rejecting is a reading of 'mostly' taking a wide scope and the whole sentence coming out true if most of the instances under the scope come out true. I.e. For most x, if Fx then Gx would be true if 'if Fx then Gx' is true, given the standard semantics, for most x. But that is just to reject a certain reading of how the adverbial modifier operates, not the semantics for conditionals altogether. Given your account so far I think the best thing to say is that it is open for Lewis to go either way. Nothing in his semantics is committing him one way or the other. The best thing to consider is this: What is, intuitively, the right semantics for those weird sentences. Then, check if that answer conflicts with anything in Lewis's system. Suppose that no students cheat. Then you get: For most of no cases, the students get a B+. We could call this trivially true or trivially false (I think). It does not conflict with his main account to say it is trivially true, and I don't currently see this conflicting with anything if we say it is trivially false. The question to answer is: What is true in most of zero cases? Is it everything, or nothing? 

"This statement" would have to include the transitive closure of all of the supporting theorems and axioms, i.e. a suitable propositional calculus, definitions of all the terms used, etc. Coherence can be difficult to establish when one's claim involves the incoherence (non-absoluteness or relativism) of all other things. We can arrive at a contradiction by introducing a new statement, built using the axioms and calculus in response 1, that simply refers externally to your original statement and claims it is true. Then the original statement implies that the external statement (which is not itself) is not absolute. If it is not absolute, then it follows that the self-referential version, which must have an equivalent truth value, is not absolute either. We could therefore extend our original "This statement" to include the infinite set of all things consequent from it according to its axioms and calculus. How to ensure that an unseen result is not eventually consequent from one's initial axioms may be difficult to prove. There exists an identical statement built on a similar stack of calculus and definitions, but different only nominally, that is, that "This Statement" #2 versus your original "This Statement" #1. Thus it would be possible to build numerous such claims in parallel. However, if any one of them is true, then all the others are false. There is no fundamental distinction among the reasoning applied or the truth value assigned to each of them, and so if any is true, all are false, leading to a contradiction. Therefore the worldview in question is incoherent. A coherent worldview cannot assume that there are no absolutes not already contained in the set of one's own limited claims. On the contrary, it must continually assimilate other absolutes which are perceptible and/or consequent from the initial statement. 

A social construction manifests into multiple forms of construction. Social means pertaining to society; a society is multiple people that voluntarily bind each other to a contract or are believed to born into a social construct; this contract lays down multiple structures of living that unify the group. The structures built are: racial, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious. These structures are legal structures that appear to essentialize the human in these social groups to a rigid role; if one defies these laws that one must to adhere to to be a legal racial identity, or ethnic identity, then ostracism occurs; punitivity is seen as the correcting devise to keep one following the law of one's imposed identity. The construction aspect is a legal idea; it supposedly coheres individuals as one identity so nothing foreign can dismantle the group. It's as if individuals disappear, a mass just appears. Interestingly, social construction may be seen a product of biological determinism; the social identity is a fixed and innate identity one is born with; it's as if biology, chemistry, physics constructs these social groups; religion believes these identities are God given, morality believes these identity allow for mutual and fluid activity amongst each other without friction. This is the conservative position. Social construction is seen as a fluid, individual, purely as an experiential identity. It's as if these identities are not actually objective identifies from the 'real'; these identities stem from the ideal; the ideal changes due to experiences not biological mechanisms such as cells, hearts and lungs. This gives forth a plurality of interpretations of what one identity means not just having different identities. The individual is free to derive their identity from personal experience relative to others within group, but also relative to other social groups; intersectional identities can be formed where different social groups interact to form new experiences that enhance unity not break apart unity. Social construction is an extremely relative definition depending on whatever school of thought one adheres to. Objectivists will see sociy construction differently from the subjectivist, etc. Is social construction a social construction; depends on who you ask. It could be a synthesis of all perspectives. 

What reason do we have to think that the best answers are voted up? I am fully confident that the website manages to make the answers that are voted up rise to the top, but what, if anything, underwrites that only the best answers are voted up. Sure, I can see that anybody who thinks some answer is better than another will upvote it, but why should I think that anybody is any good at telling good answers from bad answers. Also, what makes an answer good? Presumably what we get is instead some ranking of what others take to be good answers to the question. This is primarily evidence for what others believe makes an answer good or bad, but how can we infer anything from what others take to be good answers to what are good answers? Maybe what makes an answer good is just that we agree that it is good. But when I'm doing philosophy I don't want to get at what we agree about, I want to get at what's true. Where do we get the connection from? 

Not if it is strong enough to express first order arythmetic and states its own consistency. That's GÃ¶del's second incompleteness theorem. I went through the proof once for a class, but here is a quote from wikipedia: For any formal effectively generated system T including basic arithmetical truths and also certain truths about formal provability, if T includes a statement of its own consistency then T is inconsistent. I hope that's relevant to your question.
