I agree with keshlam, it is good to make it easy to type. The major question is whether it is of significant important. The thing to realize about a URL is that it is gibberish unless the person goes to the web site. Gibberish is bad. So, basically if there is a high probability the person would visit the site, then it is good, but if the link is just "ancillary" information, then it is bad, because it could just amount to gibberish. Cases where I would consider an URL relevant and useful: 

What he did is more like a taunt than an accusation. An accusation is when your boss goes to someone else and tells them you exaggerated your credentials. Personally, I think bossing somebody around to do something they themselves are incapable of is kind of a loser move. If it's so important, why isn't HE taking care of it? Blaming shit on your underlings is what losers do. If you want to try to smooth things over, tell him you are very sorry he got the wrong impression about your skills and focus on the details of the problem. Explain the 10 different things you need to do to fix the problem and what you are doing in each case. The better he understands the details of the problem, the more relaxed he will become. People get agitated and angry when they don't understand something. Right now he is angry because he does not understand why the problem is not getting solved fast enough. Help him understand why that is. 

Just ask to meet/see the team you'll be working with. The entire team. Say you're interviewing with 3 people and the time for "questions" comes. At that time say "I'd like to meet the team." What will probably happen is they'll take you over to the area where your to-be-teammates are. If you don't see any other women on the team, then simply don't join. You, as the job hunter, are responsible for investigating the environment you are placing yourself in. Sometimes, it is better to ask a question, or request to see something, which will indirectly get the response to a question in your mind, without asking that question explicitly, or having the recruiters ever even know that (working with a woman) was a concern of yours. 

Do not give notice unless it is unambiguously clear that the notice will be respected. If you have any reason to even suspect your employer would fire you for giving notice, then do not give notice. Simply leave on your last day. You can only claim unemployment if you were "laid off", in other words let go for budgetary reasons, which is not the case here. Also, applying for and receiving unemployment is humiliating and time-consuming. Since you have a job lined up, you would probably not qualify for unemployment anyway, but in any event it would probably not be worth it just to try to collect two weeks worth of unemployment. 

Here's my opinion. You should not miss the opportunity to have great in-game art. You should try to harness this person's capabilities as best you can. At the same time, what Sean is saying, is toxicity is unacceptable and can kill your team. If he demotivates the other artists and prevents the game from getting finished, that's not too good. So there are a few ways you can handle this. 1) One is, make him aware that his comments are hurtful. Explain to him that he needs to be tactful in commenting on other people's work. You'll never reach your goal if your team is continually sabotaging itself. 2) If you can modularize the work, and act as the middle man, then you can kind of reduce reason for Mr. Direct to put other people down. 

Of course, going into any employer where you are going to face a built-in prejudice will be a hard life, so you need to think carefully about taking a step like this. 

That is a tricky problem. Tell them that learning on the job is fine with you and that you have an agreed on start date and that you NEED to start on that date for financial reasons. 

Transferring code from A to B is theft of trade secrets if the code is of a proprietary nature, which is a criminal offense. This type of theft is not often prosecuted, but when it is the employee may face a jail sentence and the receiving company may be sued for a lot of money. It depends how big the companies are and how valuable the source code is. If you are transferring completely generic code, like, say a sorting algorithm, then it is OK, because that is considered "tools of the trade" which are your own property. But if there is anything that is specific, then it belongs 100% to company A and it is crime to transfer it elsewhere or reveal it to a third party. 

Without sounding too harsh, your use of language is awkward. I can deconstruct your writing style sentence by sentence. 

Should be: "People have told me that I can communicate what I want to say, but it is not simple and clear" 

If they involve you in the pranks, just tell them you don't like pranks and they annoy you. If they don't stop annoying you, complain. There is no way to have a bunch of pranksters both consider you in the group while you do not participate in the activities of their social group. Deciding to be an "outlier" is something done by how you act. So you can't have it both ways. I completely understand your desire not to be annoyed! Don't be in such need of acceptance that you're willing to endure pain or bullying for it. If they act inappropriately, take the necessary steps to shut it down. 

If it is a big company there is a high probability of the references being called by someone in HR. In many cases the HR person will have a laundry list of standard questions to ask the reference. Things like: Why did the candidate leave your company? Would you hire this person again? Did they work well with others? Things like that. A smaller company it is more of a crap shoot, but there is probably at least a 50-50 chance. 

I don't know what the laws are in your country. In the United States you could document your unpaid hours and then sue the employer, assuming that you are a wage earner (not an exempt employee). You need to have ironclad evidence you actually worked the hours in question. Another strategy would be to contact the employee that got fired and try to induce them to sue the employer. Yet another idea would be to rat the company out to whatever government agency is in charge of enforcing labor laws (it would be the EEOC/Department of Labor in the United States).
