And? The worst they can do is say "no," but it certainly sounds like he really wants you, which puts you in a position of power, from a negotiations standpoint. And, speaking of that, here's an article I think you need to read. Written by an engineer, for other engineers, but most of it's applicable to anyone, especially someone like you whom the hiring manager specifically wants to hire. Ask for +25%, but settle for not taking a pay cut (maybe - personally, I'd probably settle for a smaller than normal pay bump in this spot... +5%, instead of +10%... call it a friend discount, if you can talk me down to it). You're worth it, you know you're worth it, and it sounds like he does too - that's why he's seeking you out. Emphasize those aspects, rather than inventing other job offers, or interest from other companies. 

The best approach is to not risk offending the person. In this case, that means not using a gender-specific honorific, as most people are understandably ... "attached" to being referred by the gender pronoun they prefer. Men generally don't like being referred to as women, women generally don't like being referred to as men, and almost no one likes the implication that their gender identity is unclear. So, in this case, you can basically either not use a salutation, or use a salutation wihtout an honorific when addressing this person until you know their gender. Your other options, like using "Sir or Madam" or "Mr./Mrs." make you sound like a form letter, or run the risk of referencing the person using the wrong gender, and therefore, ought to be avoided. My choice would probably be to start the email out a brief sentence that makes no reference to the person's name (such as "Thank you so much for your time...") which I would use as or in place of a salutation, or use their first and last names and no honorific in or as a salutation (such as "Dear Sam Doe" or just "Sam Doe"). 

These internships in particular are concerned with cultivating candidates that they'd look at hiring in a couple years, after completion of the degree program. If you're expecting to graduate, go to grad school, found a startup, or take a year off to travel, you're not what they're looking for in a candidate for this particular program. 

The people they have will find new jobs, and you'll be so understaffed that no amount of "shoulder to the wheel" will get the job get done. You'll all burnout, and productivity will plummet, so the job won't get done. You guys will see the light, stop enabling this behavior and restrict yourselves to reasonable workloads. 

Well, you can always ask for anything you want. Don't expect an answer on this one, though. I don't think it's particularly unprofessional to ask, though it would demonstrate a level of inexperience on your part - everyone who's been around even a little has a general idea of what recruiters charge or bill at, relative to what their placements make. For what it's worth, you also have how this works backwards. Recruiters for permanent placement take a percentage cut of the salary their placement makes, and/or get a set placement fee, which is also (usually) based on the placement's salary. For contract work, recruiters generally bill a rate determined on the position, and pay the contractor less than that. It's highly unlikely you're being put in at a lower rate, because that would be money out of the recruiter's pocket, for no good reason. It's possible you didn't negotiate a high enough rate for yourself with the recruiter, but that's on you, and has nothing to do with the relationship or billing between the recruiter and the client company. There's also usually a pretty standard rate for what you do that doesn't deviate much, though... recruiters generally make their money through volume, rather custom-tailored matches, so they generally don't negotiate a lot with potential placements. The rate is the rate; take it, or we'll offer it to someone else who will. 

If the person or organization on the other end of line has any sense at all, they'll realize they won't be able to get through, and stop trying. Unfortunately, not all do, so this will only dissuade some from calling back, and doesn't address the root issues here, but it's probably the best you, personally, can do about it. (Seems to me like hiring a receptionist and having a computerized call routing system would solve both problems, as would managers just letting unidentified calls go to voicemail, but if they haven't done so already, there's probably a deeper reason than not having thought of it already.) 

To play devil's advocate for a moment here, I'll say that the honest answer is a fine, if poorly worded answer. Don't use the "minimum effort" bit, as it makes you sound like you're planning on slacking your way through the job, if not life in general. If you want to take this approach, phrase it more along the lines of wanting to work for them because you need the money, and they seem to offering you a deal you see favorably. Of course, a "fine" answer is still beaten by a "good" answer, and if you take this approach, you'll be putting yourself at a disadvantage to every sycophant who gives the "correct" answer that they have a passion for the industry or love the job, or always had dreams about working for the company. In my experience, that's OK. You are who you are, and most people are not happy working a job where they have to pretend to be something they're not (such as a gung-ho, enthusiastic zealot for some company that only exists to make some rich people richer). Personally, I find that fake enthusiasm and forced team building and culture to be offensive, so I'd never want to work somewhere that sees that artificial and shallow loyalty as a desirable trait anyway. So, being honest, even when it puts you at a disadvantage can be beneficial in keeping you from getting a job you won't be happy with, but of course, that only matters if you can afford to be choosy and wait for a good job that's a good fit for you to come along. There is also the consideration that anyone doing job interviews hears the right answer all day, and giving a well phrased, but honest answer can even be a way to distinguish yourself from the pack of sycophants they've been interviewing their way through. For me, that's typically been that I'm a techie, I love working with systems and so on, been doing it since before I was in grade school, and would be an asset to any team... an asset who don't much care who I ply my trade for, so long as they let me do the job I love and treat me fairly. If you can manage something like that - positioning yourself as a passionate employee, without spouting the same trite sycophantic garbage everyone else is spewing, you've found your sweet spot. Portraying honesty or genuineness and passion to a potential employer is better than just portraying one or the other. 

One of the most useful phrases I ever learned in my hellish time in a helpdesk role was "show me". People suck at describing their problems, but they're generally pretty good at showing what's wrong. Instead of listening to technobabble for half an hour before the customer gets so mad that you have to call in security, try asking them to show you the problem, and generally, the sooner, the better. It's so useful, it's generally my first resort when dealing with someone non-technical, or even the very moment I hear anything that strikes me as technobabble or poor descriptive ability. A real time saver, not to mention it spares me the mental anguish of having to listen to painfully tortured descriptions of basic computer functions. 

If "team lead" is a supervisor or managerial position, and therefore grants you any actual authority over him, you tell him that the discussion's over, you made your decision, and he needs to deal with it. If "team lead" isn't a position that grants you extra authority, but rather makes you just the most senior person in the group, then you take the issue to your manager and let him deal with it. And whatever the manager decides is what you do. Either way, if a discussion isn't going to be productive and simply turn into arguing, simply don't have one, because nothing but bad feelings are coming out of it. And, as it may apply to the general dynamic, I'll relate an old political trick or axiom that may come in handy. Always concede on principle. If you tell someone they're right, in principle, you'd be surprised how often you can to them to agree to the exact opposite in practice. 

You can't, and honestly, probably shouldn't. It's inevitable that he'll figure out his worth (or at least figure out that he's worth a lot more than you guys are paying him) and move on to somewhere that appreciates his abilities and will pay him commensurate to his abilities. The fact that it should be a no-brainer for your company to see his value doesn't alter the case - if anything, it makes the situation harder to resolve the way you want. If, in fact, they're trying hard not to see or acknowledge his value, any attempt to change that will result in a lot of pushback, at a minimum. So, even if you succeeded, you'd end up fighting a battle for a guy who's inevitably going to leave anyway, and that's not good for you. It also sounds like staying there isn't good for him either, so the only benefit would be to the company that's not treating him right in the first place. Best option for you is to be one of the managers who mentors and helps this kid out while he's there - when he does move on to bigger, better and higher-paying things, that will put you in a position to personally benefit from his career advancement as well. (Maybe he brings you over with him, maybe you can get a referral fee from a shop that's a better fit for him, maybe he just opens up doors and provides connections you wouldn't otherwise have, but there's a lot of ways this could be advantageous to both you and him... just not at your current company.) 

You could sue them, but that's probably a bad idea. (Expensive, time-consuming, difficult to prove, and would ruin your reputation.) It's one of those things in life where you simply have very little recourse. 

The implication there (at least to me) is that even when executives were presented with empirical evidence that overwork was causing problems rather than fixing them, they wanted their employees to be trained to appear like they were putting in long hours, even when they weren't. In this type of case, the least bad option from a practical standpoint is to figure out how you and your colleague can appear to work longer hours than you actually are.
