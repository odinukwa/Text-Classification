The main reason may simply be that there doesn't need to be a speed limit, and that there never was a compelling reason to implement one. For the most part, freeway speeds are self-regulating. Secondly, it is simply not true that there is no speed limit on the freeway. There is no general speed limit, but most stretches of the Autobahn do have individual speed limits. Only a few long-distance stretches between cities truly don't have a speed limit. Those stretches are usually two lanes in each direction, and frequently heavily congested (during summer vacation traveling season, traffic jams of 100km are not unheard of). In winter, snow and ice also naturally limits speeds. Basically, there are very few stretches and times when you really can drive very fast, often only in the middle of the night. Keep in mind that in the USA, for a long time, there was no speed limit on the freeways, either. If it hadn't been for the 1970s oil crisis, there still would be no speed limit. Disclaimer: things may have changed. It has been a quarter century since I lived in Germany. 

You should first read the Wikipedia account of the Revolution of 1905 for the general background of your ancestor's story, and try to see the movie Battleship Potemkin for a dramatic presentation of the events in Odessa. (This movie is a prime example of victors' history, but is a good watch.) It is not an oversimplification to say that there were many political parties in Russia in 1905 with a variety of subtly different reformist and revolutionary positions, and from your description alone it would be hard to pinpoint which particular faction your great great grandfather adhered to. 

Construing your question narrowly, as asking what "turned within" and "turned without" mean, the answer is plain. The first sentence of the passage in question is, in the original, 

As justCal suggested, the symbol in question is a ligature of Tls, used as a unit of currency, the value of one tael's weight of silver. The Reports on Trade at the Treaty Ports in China for the year 1870 has many instances of un-ligatured "Tls", the word "Taels", the ligatured form of "Tls", all in contexts making it clear they are used synonymously. If you search about in that book for "tls" you will find instances of amounts like "Haikwon Tls. 1,496,293.6.3.8", unligatured, and elsewhere tabulations headed with currency labels, in some places just the ligature, and in other places "Hk. Tls. m.c.c" with Tls ligatured, and figures like "68,873.4.3.7" underneath. The tenth part of a tael is a mace, the 100th part is a candareen and the 1000th part is a cash (see, eg, this); I surmise the m.c.c. refers to these fractions, much as L.s.d. refers to pounds and their fractional parts, shillings and pence in English financial tabulations. 

It boils down to simple mathematics. The US electoral system is mostly based on a winner-takes-all approach (BTW, that's mostly not written into the Constitution, but rather evolved ad-hoc, for similar mathematical reasons). In a winner-takes-all system, only the two biggest vote-getters will ever have meaningful influence, so it is natural for a dualism to evolve. The other factor is that in politics, nothing can be accomplished by yourself, only by teaming up into some form of coalition and alliances. For the most part, long term coalitions and alliances are far more valuable to all participants (because they allow calling in favors far in the future). Take that together with the natural dualism inherent in the electoral system, and you have the making for a very stable two-party system. Interestingly, the same mechanism is also driving another aspect: diversity within each party. Many European democracies don't use a winner-takes-all system, and as a result have more parties participate in the democratic process. The price for it, though, is that parties are far more homogeneous internally than US parties, to the point that party leaders can enforce party-line votes by controlling who will even be on the ballots. 

I am reading WILLIAM AND MARY by John Van Der Kiste 2008, 2011, in which he relates William III's reluctant plans to remarry after Mary II's death. This was to ensure the Protestant succession after Anne's death, as well as a future Stadtholder, particularly in view of the young Duke of Gloucester's precarious health. One of the "candidates" was Louise Dorothea Sophia, the daughter of Frederick of Brandenburg. Van der Kiste discusses the protocol when, in 1696,William travelled to the Rhine to meet Frederick and the prospective bride. Initially, neither Frederick nor William would sit down, each reluctant to take the only great armchair. Kiste goes on: 

Not all Roman "workers" were slaves, and in fact my (very small) Latin dictionary has three words for "workman" - none of them being "servus". To say that in Latin " a world without slaves " would mean "a world without workers" is simply wrong. There were butchers, fishmongers, fullers, dyers, schoolmasters, doctors, tavern-keepers - all workers, but not slaves. Otherwise, there would have been no need for "bread and circuses" - the free dole of grain and entertainments used to keep poor Roman citizens happy. Domestic servants would normally have been slaves, although the Romans were surprisingly generous in manumitting their slaves - the Greeks were astonished by this. Some slaves were what we would now call "white collar workers" - secretaries, administrators, tutors (paedagogi), family physicians in the richest homes. These were often freed, like Cicero's amanuensis, Tiro, who continued to serve Cicero as his freedman and later collected some of his former master's writings. Of course slavery was evil, but to see the Roman world as divided between a rich elite and enchained slaves is unnuanced and incorrect. There could be genuine affection and care between master and slave - Cicero wrote letters to Tiro, concerned for his health when the latter was sick, and Cicero's household slaves protected their master when his killers came looking for him! It is entirely possible that slaves with a decent master had a better life than the poor free citizens, living in cramped tenements that regularly caught fire, and wondering where the next meal was coming from. In short, while all slaves were workers, not all workers were slaves. 

A peace treaty with just Poland really makes little sense; it would have had to be a peace treaty with the Soviet Union (and the US, Britain and France) as well. Until 1990, West Germany would not have considered a peace treaty because it would mean permanently ceding East Germany. The Germans preferred to have the formal status of occupied country. After 1990, a peace treaty really made little sense; it was made obsolete by historic events. If anything, it could have re-ignited old memories that everybody involved would prefer to bury. Poland and (post-Soviet) Russia both self-identified as having transformed themselves, and Germany was all to happy to agree with that. So WW II pretty much ended by mutually forgetting about it, rather than a formal peace treaty. 

The shape of borders reflects the history and commerce at the time. In the eastern US, borders are often formed by geographic features because transportation at the time was very relevant - and transportation largely depended on waterways. For instance, the northern border of Indiana is straight - but it's about 10 miles further north than it would be as an extension of the Ohio border. This was made to give Indiana access to Lake Michigan. The western border of Massachusetts is straight except for the southernmost few miles. This happened because of a mountain range. This little notch would have been almost impossible to police from MA, but is easy to reach from New York. Going further west, there are several factors that led to straighter borders. 

Short answer (Edited and expanded) A full one would require a book or several. Gothic architecture was a break from the Romanesque style which preceded it, based on round arches, fat columns, and thick walls or buttresses to bear the downward and outward thrust, and small windows. The pointed arch of the Gothic is more efficient at load-bearing; it also deals better with changes in space - eg a wide nave meeting a narrower transept - since the angle of the arch can be varied without awkward junctions. This, together with flying buttresses enabled Gothic (churches) to rise higher, use slimmer, often clustered, columns and, crucially, permit more window openings. They were open to the Divine light, windows into Heaven. 1) Rheims Cathedral Interior 

I would suggest the answer is "No" - and the aristocracy would not actually include gentry either. Social gradations at that time were subtle but strong, a wealthy "gentleman" would still defer to a peer, even if the peer were the poorer. Read Jane Austen and Anthony Trollope for examples. But royalty was in a different category, as, indeed, it is today; the tabloids might titter if a Duke were caught in a compromising position, but it would not be the headline news that a royal scandal would provoke. Also - and I stand to be corrected on this - the aristocracy's influence came from land (vast holdings in many cases) industry (they weren't above exploiting coal or other resources) and their power of patronage. Royals, to the best of my knowledge, lacked the first two - Parliament frequently was asked to bail out profligate Princes! And - a final touchstone - would a Duke, say, challenge a prince to a duel (rare occurrences but not unknown)? The answer is almost certainly not, such an act would be treasonable. 

This story is not present in the 1815 book, A History of the Western Division of the County of Sussex: Including the Rapes of Chichester, Arundel, and Bramber, with the City and Diocese of Chichester, Volume 1, p.134, which says East Marden is "ill supplied with water." According to A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 4, the Rape of Chichester (1953) pp.107-108, the church dates to the 13th century and none of the parish's other buildings earlier than 1728; it makes no mention of the well. (Note that the word Rape in the titles of these two cited works is a term for a territorial subdivision of (apparently only) the county of Sussex.) 

Both of which are close enough to the translation in your book. The metaphor here is that consciousness is an eye, seeing either the outside world or one's inward nature. But a vile veil distorts what it sees, and (B goes on to say) the veil was first lifted in Italy. The larger question, of what Burkhardt meant, or whether he was right, or why he was sure he was right, or what a well-educated mind should make of all of this, is beyond my ken or care. 

I think the premise of the question may be arguable. Scientific progress happened everywhere - it's human nature to inquire and explore. Scientific progress is also a threat to those in power. We have seen this problem in Europe, too (see the Copernicus trial). So the real question shouldn't be why scientific exploration took place in Europe, but rather why were attempts to choke it off less successful in Europe than in the Islamic world? I suspect that there were three separate reasons. One is that in Europe, science had reached a critical mass that the Church was unable to stop. A second one was that the church actually was split down the middle on that topic. The church actually was the major sponsor of scientific research, universities etc. The third reason may simply be the maturity of the religion. Islam is about 700 years younger than Christianity, and historically we have seen it go through similar steps of development. Maybe there is a "natural lifecycle" to religions. Islam in the 16th century may simply have been where Christianity was in the 9th century. 

Biological factors play a major role. People, and in particular women, have a limited age range when they can procreate. When maximizing procreating (whether for its own sake, or to have many children providing social security) was the goal of marriage, that would argue for an earlier marriage age. Infant mortality would also call for women having more time for plenty of pregnancies. Maternal mortality would probably call for higher average marriage age. Very young mothers would be at higher risk (and people would have known that). Today, we are probably near the upper end of the age range where marriage for procreation purposes is feasible at all, and then only with very small family sizes. That would support the notion that historically, people did marry younger (although it does not say how much younger). Marrying late is, in a way, a luxury. During times of turmoil or disease, people would have children (and thus marry) as early as possible. During times of peace, prosperity, and longevity, people could afford to wait longer. Incidentally, it seems that @Semaphore's data also follows the same general pattern: a higher average marriage age in wealthy Florence, for instance, and it seems that generally the higher marriage ages seem to correlate with peaceful periods. Based on all of that, you will probably find the following patterns:
