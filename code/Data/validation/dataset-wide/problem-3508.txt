Real GDP levels are also used in empirical research papers and books -for example, in Blanchard & Fischer, the first figure in the book is real GNP (not per capita). A technical issue regarding per capita magnitudes is that population is not measured quarterly, or yearly (in fact it is usually measured per decade). So any attempt to provide quarterly or yearly "GDP per capita" figures would require extrapolating the population from sparser data. While this is not necessarily catastrophic as regards accuracy, it requires more resources to be devoted to its calculation. Per capita concepts certainly appear more often in theoretical research papers. The main reason is that theoretical models look also for possible "steady-states" (as attractors of the economy's evolution). Since GDP in levels exhibits a long-run upward trend, the next step is to consider "GDP per capita" (to "take out" the effect of population growth), and then the next step is to consider efficiency-indexed growth, like "GDP per labor efficiency unit", in order to look for the model's steady-state. 

Looking at eq. $(12)$ of the paper the left-hand-side of $(13)$ is $\lambda_{i,t+1}$ which in turn is part of $$\Lambda_{i,t+1} = \frac {1+\lambda_{i,t+1}}{1+\lambda_{i,t}}$$ $\Lambda_{i,t+1}$ is discussed in the middle of p. 536 (between eq. 5 and eq. 6). As the authors write, 

Even after the comments exchange I am not totally sure what is the problem of the OP, but I will answer the question in the title. Assume that we have a model $$Y_i = \beta X_i + u_i,\;\;\; i=1,...,n$$ Assume that we obtain a "random sample" of observations from $\{Y_i, X_i\}$. This makes each observation $i$ identically and independently distributed from all other observations. Now consider the random variable $$v_i=(X_i-\mu _X)u_i = (X_i-\mu _X)(Y_i - \beta X_i) = X_iY_i - \beta X_i^2 - \mu_XY_i+\mu_x\beta X_i$$ while also $$j\neq i : v_j=(X_j-\mu _X)u_j = (X_j-\mu _X)(Y_j - \beta X_j)=X_jY_j - \beta X_j^2 - \mu_XY_j+\mu_x\beta X_j$$ $v_i$ is a function of random variables $\{Y_i, X_i\}$ only, while $v_j$ is a function of random variables $\{Y_j, X_j\}$ only which are independent from $\{Y_i, X_i\}$. So $v_i$ is independent from $v_j$. More over, since $X_i$ follows the same distribution as $X_j$, and $X_j$ follows the same distribution as $Y_j$, we have that $X_iY_i$ follows the same distribution as $X_jY_j$.Etc. So we also conclude that $v_i$ will have the same distribution as $v_j$. 

Continuing on my comment, if both parameters are set strictly higher than unity, then we can get all the range, indicatively: 

Comment: There is a Present that needs to be dealt with, just like with human bodies. To (slightly) paraphrase Milton Friedman: 

Consider the extreme case: all available quantity of the no-substitute input is already employed. To trace the supply function, let's assume that we are already at some price level, and let's increase the price of the final good: will quantity supplied increase? No, because it cannot do so -there is no available additional input to use for this increase. In this extreme case the price elasticity of supply of the final good is zero, due to the situation in the inputs market. Assume now that a little quantity of the no-substitute input is still unemployed. Being unique, we expect that it will command a high price if it is demanded for employment. So increasing quantity supplied of the final good, bears a high cost in terms of steeply increasing production costs. In this case, the price elasticity of supply of the final good is not zero, but "small"... ...compared to the case where the inputs needed for production are generally available and so the cost to employ them is smaller than in the previous case. Here we expect that under the same as before final-good price increase, final-good suppliers will find it profitable to increase their quantity supplied more than in the former case -so here the price elasticity of supply of the final good will be "large"(er). 

The whole point of the (specific) Labor Theory of Value that you apparently refer to, is that, what Labor "injects" as value into goods produced, is more than what Labor needs to consume in order to survive. This is a fundamental assumption/argument, in order to answer the question "how profits come about?". Then, since the theory argues that profits spring solely from Labor, it follows that they should not be appropriated by the holders of capital (the holders of capital should only get the value of capital etc that goes into the goods produced, a value that does not "inject more" than what it already is). Simply put, after paying third parties for purchases etc out of Sales, and calculating depreciation (which is what the holders of capital should receive), the rest, that would appear as profits, should be distributed to the workers (because it is the workers that created this surplus, not the capital) and not retained by the capital holders. But because they are not thus distributed, the theory of exploitation emerges. Even more simply, I need to eat one Kgr of bread to produce two Kgr of bread, in which production other goods, equipment etc have participated, whose value amounts to only half-Kgr of bread. I take as wage the one Kgr of bread, and all other factors of production take their half-Kgr of bread. Another half-Kgr of bread remains. It is taken by the owner of the bread business as "profits". It should be given to me, because it materialized solely because of the participation of my labor in the production process -or so the theory argues. Therefore the phrase in the question 

So the "natural rate of interest" is that level compatible with zero inflation (or deflation). But at the same time, always according to the inventor of the concept (p. 106), the natural rate of interest 

Well, you cannot take the derivative of $E(n)$ with respect to $n$, because $n$ is an integer variable. More generally, you want to prove a property with respect to $n$. The problem you have is that the corresponding domain is not a convex set: say, for $n$ and $n+1$, $0<\lambda <1$, the value $\lambda n + (1-\lambda) (n+1) = n+1-\lambda$ does not belong to the domain since it is not an integer. But if the domain of the function, with respect to the variable you are interested in, is not a convex set, the concept of convexity/concavity is not even defined (perhaps in higher mathematics they have some more nuanced concept to accommodate that). To determine whether the inequality you want holds, a brute-force algebraic approach is to examine its sign directly: we have $$[E(n+2) - E(n+1)] - [E(n+1) - E(n)] =\\= (n+2) \int_0^\infty p (1-F)^{n+2-1} F' \mathrm d p \\- 2 (n+1) \int_0^\infty p (1-F)^{n+1-1} F' \mathrm d p\\ +n \int_0^\infty p (1-F)^{n-1} F' \mathrm d p$$ $$= \int_0^\infty p (1-F)^{n-1} F'\cdot\Big[(n+2)(1-F)^2 - 2(n+1)(1-F)+n\Big] \mathrm d p $$ Doing the algebra $$(n+2)(1-F)^2 - 2(n+1)(1-F)+n \\= n(1-F)^2 + 2(1-F)^2 - 2n(1-F) - 2(1-F) +n \\ = n\Big[(1-F)^2 - 2(1-F) +1\Big] - 2(1-F)F \\ = n [(1-F) -1]^2 - 2(1-F)F = nF^2 - 2(1-F)F = F\Big[nF-2+2F\Big]\\ =F\cdot \Big[(n+2)F-2\big]$$ So we have arrived at $$[E(n+2) - E(n+1)] - [E(n+1) - E(n)] = \int_0^\infty p (1-F)^n F'\cdot\Big[(n+2)F-2\Big] \mathrm d p$$ Breaking up and manipulating, $$[E(n+2) - E(n+1)] - [E(n+1) - E(n)] = \\=(n+2)\int_0^\infty p (1-F)^{n+1} F' \mathrm d p \\- \left(\frac{2}{n+1}\right)(n+1)\int_0^\infty p (1-F)^n F'\mathrm d p$$ $$\implies [E(n+2) - E(n+1)] - [E(n+1) - E(n)] = E(n+2)-\frac{2}{n+1}E(n+1)$$ Simplifying $E(n+2)$ from both sides we get $$-2E(n+1) + E(n) = -\frac{2}{n+1}E(n+1)$$ $$\implies E(n) = \frac {2n}{n+1}E(n+1)$$ and by induction $$\implies E(n+1) = \frac {2(n+1)}{n+2}E(n+2) \implies E(n+2) = \frac {n+2}{2(n+1)}E(n+1)$$ Therefore $$[E(n+2) - E(n+1)] - [E(n+1) - E(n)] = $$ $$= \left(\frac {n+2}{2(n+1)} -1\right)E(n+1) - \left( 1- \frac {2n}{n+1}\right)E(n+1) $$ $$= \left(\frac {n+2}{2(n+1)} -1 - 1+ \frac {2n}{n+1}\right)E(n+1)$$ $$=\frac {n+2 - 4(n+1) + 4n}{2(n+1)}E(n+1) = \frac {n-2}{2(n+1)}E(n+1)$$ So $n=1$ is not a search, for $n=2$ we have equality, and for $n\geq 3$ the inequality holds. 

The Expected Utility property is not a property that depends on the functional form of the utility function. Its existence depends on satisfying certain "axioms" (which would be more acurately be described as "conditions"), that have to do with preferences/behavior of human beings. They may be given a strict mathematical expression (which is good), but they have to do with preferences, i.e. before any functional form for the utility function is specified. Let's see what that means. In a comment the OP wrote 

Implementing the "affine transformation", let $$u(x) = A-B\exp\{-\lambda x\}$$ Then we want to solve $(x_1 = 2400, x_2 = 5000)$ $$A-B\exp\{-\lambda x_1\} = \frac 12 \Big[A-B\exp\{-\lambda x_2\}\Big]+\frac 12 \Big[A-B\exp\{-\lambda \cdot 0\}\Big]$$ $$\implies A-B\exp\{-\lambda x_1\} = A - \frac 12B - \frac 12B\exp\{-\lambda x_2\}$$ $$\implies \frac 12B -B\exp\{-\lambda x_1\} + B\frac 12\exp\{-\lambda x_2\} =0$$ $$\implies -\frac 12 +\exp\{-\lambda x_1\} - \frac 12\exp\{-\lambda x_2\} =0$$ and we verify that $A,B$ do not matter. This is a non-linear function in one variable, and a computer algorithm should be used to find the possible solutions. In this particular case, trial-and-error by hand (or naive graphing in a spreadsheet) may mislead, because, as the posted solution by the OP in a comment shows, the non-zero value for $\lambda$ that satisfies the equation is very small, $\lambda = 0.0032$. So if one tries to graph the function in a spreadsheet, it must specify very small increments for $\lambda$ otherwise it will miss the small interval for which the function becomes positive for strictly positive values of $\lambda$, and then falls to zero and negative values again. Making matters worse,the values of the actual prizes are too large numerically when inserted into the exponential function, and so the increments for lambda should be even smaller, if one would want to "see" the solution in a spreadsheet.. For example to use the actual levels of the prices as coefficients of the equation, one needs to specify increments of the order $10^{-5}$. One could input the prizes in hundreds or in thousands... (the solution in the link posted in the comment uses hundreds), which allows for larger increments.
