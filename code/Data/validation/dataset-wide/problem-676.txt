How long do you have? How strong is your motivation? How good are the bikes? Unfortunately, most exercise bikes have a very poor "simulated feel", and a real cyclist tires of them pretty quickly. This is especially true of the old friction bikes and many of the wind and magnetic trainers. A few (Expresso bikes, and some of the newer Le Monde bikes that I've tried) do have a halfway passable "feel", though, since they have a modicum of momentum (which is the main thing missing in the others). You can use the bike for several things -- short bursts, to raise your HR and short-term aerobic capacity, long sessions (at LEAST 30 minutes, preferably longer) to tax your glucagon storage just a hair and build endurance, and brief "climbs" to strengthen your muscles. But, given access to a reasonably well-equipped gym, you probably should throw in some strength training as well, with leg presses, extensions, and curls. And, believe it or not, simply being conscious to doing more squats through the day (eg, when reaching down to open a file drawer) can produce significant improvement. And you really need longer sessions -- at least two hours at a crack -- to build your long-term endurance. These are probably best done on a real bike, though, if at all possible. I'm not convinced cadence is that important, but as a rough guide I'd say about 110 minus 65% of your age should be the upper limit, and 75% of that number would be the lower limit. (Unfortunately, many exercise bikes only work smoothly at high cadence.) My general rule for cadence lower limit is to never pedal slower than you're breathing, and that covers virtually all situations other than a brief climb. Heart rate is also a guide, but there is much individual variation in rate, so it's hard to give numbers. 

The last major technological improvement in standard bicycles was indexed shifting. The indexing part of this isn't that big a deal, but the feature also gives you the ability to shift under load (which is a big deal). I'm thinking this change occurred in the late 80s, but my memory for chronology is poor. Yes, since then we've gotten V-brakes, carbon frames, "compact" cranksets and a few other things, but they're not fundamental changes, just minor refinements (if that). Re "non-standard" bikes, the biggest change has likely been the improvements in geared hubs. These have gone from 3-speed, don't-dare-shift-under-load-or-you'll-wreck-it models to multi-speed or continuous models that encourage you to shift under load. There has also been progress in recumbent technology, but I don't think there've been any game-changers (though I'm not up on this). The main problem with a bike more than 15-20 years old is that replacement parts get harder to find. In particular, if you buy an older bike you might want to buy a spare rear cluster right off, to have on hand. And I wouldn't recommend buying a road bike with 27" tires, since replacement tires (of the narrow "racing" variety) will be hard to find. 

An important point is the forces placed on the knees. The lower the seat, the more acute the angle of the knee is when force is being applied to the pedal. This results in an unnatural stress on the knees which can lead to patellofemoral syndrome and patellar tendonitis, among other conditions. Of course, over-extending the knee due to a seat position that is too high can also cause problems. 

I say it depends on the intersection, the traffic, and your abilities. The canonical approach is to "claim" the left-turn lane by positioning your bike in the center of it. But if there's any traffic at all I will generally "hang back" at a signal-controlled intersection to let cars go first and give me some "runway", choosing to "claim" the lane when it seems "proper" (which is a multi-factoral decision). You can also do several variations of the "hook turn", the tamest being to ride across and stop at the far right corner, then dismount and cross as a pedestrian -- there is no shame in doing this if conditions warrant. In relatively light traffic, though, (especially if there's a turn lane and no one else is turning) the proper way is definitely the canonical way -- move to the center of the left-most lane and proceed as a "vehicle". 

There is also the question of whether the tire was damaged in some way when it blew off. Not only may the failure have been due to a failed bead, but also the rubber around the bead may have been damaged, or the tire may have contacted the frame or other parts and been cut before it came to a stop. 

If the tool doesn't show it to be stretched, and it's not rusted and there are no stiff links or other obvious problems, then there's no need to replace it. It is a good idea to always keep a spare chain or two on hand, though, especially if you have an "odd" chain (eg, a 5-speed chain in these days where everyone else is running 10-speed chains). It's amazing how often a shop will try to sell you the wrong chain (or tube or tire) because they don't have the right one on hand. 

Sunblock and insect repellant don't really count as "first aid" items, but you should have them, generally in a different location, for easy access and in case of leakage. You may also want ear plugs, if you'll be sleeping in tight quarters with other bikers, and snoring borthers you a lot. Also not in the "first aid" category but worthwhile is "butt butter", especially if you wear standard biking shorts. In at least 5000 miles of multi-day touring I've only ever needed the road rash stuff, sunblock, insect repellant, hydrocortisone, and aspirin (to help me sleep), plus decongestants that I take for a congenital condition. 

You should be able to wash, even submerge, your helmet in water, with perhaps a dash of mild detergent. Use no other solvents or additives. If submerging, agitate very slowly, since the force of water against pads or other loosely-attached elements can be quite strong. Dry by draining thoroughly and placing in a slightly warm place (not somewhere where you could not sit comfortably for at least a few minutes -- high heat can kill a helmet). Expect it to take 2-3 days to completely dry if submerged. DO NOT put the helmet "away" (in a bag or box, in an enclosed area, etc) before it is thoroughly dry. If pads are removable, remove them and wash separately, but washing with the helmet should not harm the pads (or their adhesive) any more than riding in the rain or sweating in the helmet. 

Go to a bike store and buy purpose-made chain oil. It will generally come in 2-3 grades from "dry" to "wet". "Dry" you'd use in dry, dusty conditions. "Wet" you'd (obviously) use in conditions where it's frequently wet. You can read the blurb on each bottle to see what sounds best for you. At the very least, wipe the chain with a rag before oiling. Ideally, use some sort of "chain washer" (ask at the bike store) to clean the chain before oiling. 

First you need to make sure you have the right chuck setup. If the pump you have is the one in the link then it claims to be auto-converting between Schrader and Presta -- you can skip to the next paragraph. But if you have a slightly different pump it may require manual conversion. As you press the chuck onto the valve you should feel some resistance as the rubber gasket in the chuck snugly fits around the valve stem. If the fit is not snug the chuck probably requires manual conversion and is probably set up for Schrader, so you need to unscrew the knurled nut on the very end of the chuck and reverse the rubber gasket inside (taking care to no lose any spring or washer behind the gasket). Regardless of whether the chuck is auto-converting you may need to tighten the knurled nut on the open end of the chuck, to make it tight enough that you feel some resistance from the gasket as you slide the chuck on. But before installing the chuck you must unscrew the little knurled knob on the top of the Presta valve. Unscrew it all the way until it stops against the crimp on the top of the threaded rod. Just to be sure you have it open, press the end of the rod with your finger and listen for the puff of air. Press the chuck onto the valve. If the Presta valve does not have a nut retaining it to keep it from sliding back into the tire you will likely need to use your thumb on the tire, on the back side of the valve, to keep the valve from sliding into the tire. When you get the chuck all the way onto the valve (about 3/4" or 2cm) then flip up the lever to lock the chuck on. (Note that there have been a few chuck designs where you flip the lever up while applying/removing the chuck, and flip it down to latch instead of vice-versa.) Once you get the chuck on properly you should be able to read the air pressure (if any) already in the tire. If not the valve is not open and you will likely not be able to get air into the tire. Once inflated, remove the chuck and screw the knurled knob down snug (but not over-tight). And install the cap, if you have one. This helps prevent damage to the relatively fragile Presta valve mechanism and prevents accidental release of air. You need to add air to your tires much more often than monthly. Once a week at the very least, and in most cases 2-3 times a week.
