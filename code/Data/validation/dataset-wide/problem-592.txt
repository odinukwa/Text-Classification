Possibly, and I would hope so. It's been a few years since I broke one, but I've never been a world class cyclist and I have broken two different trainers simply by putting too much power into them (one admittedly at about 1300W). The problem is, to some extent, intractable. People want cheap, light, quiet trainers, but those trainers have to somehow get rid of 500W or more of power for as long as you care to sit on them. Doing that in a light, quiet, cheap container is hard. 

I've built one and ridden a couple of commercially made ones (Cruzbike and a European one) and I have not been very impressed. That design has never done very well at our local races, for example. 

This is important. If you start to feel weak or have a headache you should stop, drink and cool down. If you stop sweating you're about to die, so you should immediately seek cool shelter and warn the people present (there must be people present) that you're suffering heatstroke and may pass out. Note that "sweat evaporates as fast as it appears" and "not sweating" are very different things. I find my back will generally stay wet up to about 40°C, and above that I try not to ride very hard because my body and especially my brain does not like getting above 40°C so I need to sweat just to stay alive, forget exercising. 

(via the esteemed Dave Moulton whose post I got the image from contains an interesting discussion about why we have trail) Note that the centre of drag/centre of the wheel is forward of the pivot axis. Thus, wind force from the side will tend to turn the wheel downwind, in the same direction that the wind is pushing the bike. So the rider will tend to stay upright, unless the turn makes them crash into something. The bike you have pictured has the opposite design - as the wind pushes the bike and rider away, the drag behind the steering axis will turn the steering into the wind. I predict that in many cases the centre of mass will move downwind while the support moves upwind, resulting in a fall. But note that the front wheel design pictured is at best going to require clean, dry conditions to operate, and those are normally only found on indoor velodromes, making side winds a non-issue. 

You do need 3 full links inside the spring to give enough flexibility, but with those the bike can fall over or you can flip the trailer round and hang the back of it over the handlebars to make it easier to lock bike+trailer. The slop is somewhat annoying when riding, you need to pedal quite smoothly to minimise it, but it's not too bad for light loads and it also reminds you that the trailer is there (people do forget), and the small amount of give helps when the trailer hits something (people do that). 

This blog post from Chicagobike has more discussion ("Carrying Kids on Folding Bikes") and some useful advice and experience. 

Summary: it's hard to make a light that reliably turns on only when the brakes are used. Most cyclists who want brake lights buy rear flashing lights because they're cheap and ubiquitous. Ignoring cost, to work well a brake light on the back of a bike would need to be paired with a constantly on, non-flashing light, purely so that people who saw it would recognise it as a brake light. Otherwise it's just another blinking light on a bike. Then it needs to be daylight visible, or no-one will see it. From my experience with rear lights, 200 lumens is about the level you'd want from a brake light. My always-on dynamo rear light is about half that and while it's visible it doesn't really stand out. In other words, it makes the bike more visible without being too bright. But for a "hey, I'm stopping" light, you want more than that. So the combination of a 200-500mW always-on light with a 1W or 2W "BRAKES!!!" light would probably work pretty well. Unfortunately most super-bright LED rear lights are designed to overdrive the LEDs in short flashs, but for a brake light you want a solid 2-5 seconds of on time. Which means bigger, more expensive LEDs. And also a bigger, heavier battery to drive them. The sensors are also challenging. SeeSense have done a lot of work on accellerometers in bike lights and from using their light, braking detection is ok but not brilliant. If I hit the brakes to reduce the impact of hitting a pothole, for example, the light seems to got into "holy shit" mode instead of braking mode 90% of the time. Which might be ok for a brake light, 5 seconds of braking mode in that situation is fine. But it means that I'll get 5 seconds of braking mode when I bunnyhop a curb or bounce a speed bump too. Which isn't really "braking" as I think of it - I'm definitely not slowing down at that stage. So you probably want sensors on the brake levers as well (the accellerometer is built into the CPU that runs the lights). Which means wires and fiddly mechanical bits. I dunno, that seems hard to me, you have to cover road bikes with integrated electronic shifting right down to basic V brake levers. Sounds expensive. To get an idea of costs, look at some of the KickStarter bike lights. It seems to cost about $100 to get a light to market. Which means hardware costs of about $25. If we double that because we're using, say, two 18650 LiIon batteries (18Wh) instead of one, CR123/16340 battery (half-16550, 4.5Wh) and a 0.5W RED LED as the primary light plus a pair of 1W LEDs as the brake light... ok, maybe triple it. So you're looking at a light that will cost about $200-$300, assuming the sensors are cheap and reliable. Cheap means pure accellerometers, like the last light in your list. Which makes them "something is happening" lights... just like any other blinking light on the back of a bike. 

Ideally your bars will not curve this much, or you'll use a wider ruler :) This lets you measure the exact width of the bars. Halve that, and measure in that far from one side. That's the centre :) Now make a mark there, or better still, mark the ruler and centre the bars in the stem with it in place. A couple of rubber bands can be used to hold the ruler in place while you do this - put them on the rule, put the ruler on the bars, pull a band under the bars and over the end of the rule. Repeat for other side. Now wiggle the bars in to position. Test ride, and make sure it feels right. Mark with a permanent marker both sides of the stem so you can line it up easily next time. Also, now if you repeat your measurement to the brake hoods you can twist one or both on the bars to get them symmetrical. If you prefer them that way. This also works for most other curly bars. 

It looks like a cheap enough derailleur that replacing it shouldn't cost too much, and the rust is severe enough that if the derailleur has stopped shifting I'd replace it. If you can force the derailleur to move with your hand it's very likely to can repair it just by pouring sufficient oil on it and working it backwards and forwards for a while. But whatever has caused it to rust will still exist afterwards, so unless you fix that problem the new/repaired derailleur will just rust again. If you buy a slightly more expensive one it will use better steel so will rust less readily, but the real solution is to stop leaving it out in the rain, or at least cover it. If the problem is salt spray, all you can really do is put a coating of grease on everything and reapply that every few months. Which is a good idea with derailleurs anyway, especially cheap ones. Use chain lube that's grease-plus-solvent and put a few drops of that on to the derailleurs when you oil your chain. You can save money by doing this, as $5 worth of chain lube will double the life of the chain, and probably the derailleurs too. For bikes like this a half-decent chain lube is often a miracle cure. Run it into the brake and gear cables, put it on all the pivot points you can find, coat the corroded metal with it, go a bit wild. But 3-in-1 oil and a top coat of grease will work better on the derailleur spring - you want thick and gooey for that. I use "TriFlow" but any of them will work (with the caveat that WD40 and so on are degreasers, not lubricants) 

Note that it's a really bad idea to spray the chain (or anything else) with a degreaser like WD40 before you do this. You're better off buying proper chain lube and over-lubricating the chain and derailleurs before storing the bike for any length of time. That excess will better protect them, and then when you pull it out of storage add a little more lube, spin the pedals backwards 10-20 turns, then wipe the excess off (that replaces any volatile parts of the lube that have evaporated while it was stored) 

I've found a few mentions of bikes that made it to the rumor stage, but nothing in production. The best summary seems to be here: 

No. You're correct that there is extra cost and hassle involved in collecting cadence. The question you need to answer for yourself is: does the benefit outweigh the cost. Since you don't seem to see any benefits, the answer is obviously no. You should buy things when they fill a need, rather than buying things because they are available. As far as accuracy goes, they're all accurate enough as makes no difference. Modern electronics can easily generate clocks accurate to parts per million and your variation in pedalling speed is much greater than that. 

A long time ago some bike shops stocked single cogs, but that was when there were 5 speed cassettes and few choices. Back then few people seemed interested. Today with 6,7,8,9,10,11 speed options, three major manufacturers, often with multiple materials in each width as well as other variations, there would be too many options. I suspect even the really big online shops would struggle. For comparison, look at spokes - few places stock more than the most common types in the most common sizes, let alone 2mm increments from 100mm to 400mm (Rohloff 16" wheel to front 36" wheel) Think about what's required: you want a replacement cog for the particular cassette you have, out of at least 10 options for your particular combination of manufacturer, number of cogs, material and cost. Sure, you would probably accept a cog out of the next step up or down in the manufacturers range, as long as it was compatible (hint: it probably isn't). Look online: Wiggle have 84 cassettes listed, ChainReaction have 69 MTB and 56 road cassettes, Starbike have 80 options. Assuming they average 9 cogs per cassette and 20% are duplicates/compatible, that's over 400 different cogs to stock. (too long for a comment). 

There's a whole sport - cyclocross - that involves riding road bikes off road. Typically the gearing is a little lower than a stock road bike, and these days a lot of them have disk brakes. Most will take fairly wide tyres, 38mm is not out of the question. For riding a stock road bike off road, I'd look mostly at tyres. If you can find some that will clear your frame that have a bit of tread that will help a lot. Puncture resistance may also be worth while, you're more likely to find thorns off road. I would also experiment with lower tyre pressures, as that may improve traction. Other than that, I'd just ride and see what happens. 

Unless you're unusually weak, not being able to open it means it is on too tight. Even if you are somewhat weak, unless you have disk brakes "as tight as you can" should be ok. Note that if you have disk brakes it is much more important that the quick release be tight. When you use disk brakes the reaction force is pushing the wheel down, out of the fork. It is better to have the QR slightly too tight than slightly too loose with disk brakes. Also, the QR lever should always point backwards as shown. That makes it less likely to catch on anything and be pulled open (or throw you off the bike). 

The answer is that various types of bearings have been used in bicycles and will likely continue to be. Again, Sheldon discusses needle bearings in Shimano hub gears from some years ago and they're still mentioned in the marketing. One problem not unique to bicycles but especially relevant to them, is that more precise bearings are more vulnerable to grit and also to damage. So especially needle bearings need to be carefully protected from dust, sand, and forces outside their design range. Unfortunately doing that inside a suspension unit is hard, and last time I looked Cannondale had not solved the problem (my HeadShock is unmaintainable after only about 10Mm, I've seen multiple lefty shocks fail during a race because of light rain and fine grit causing them to abrade to uselessness very quickly) But inside a hub or headset, for example, they can be amazing. I've talked to people who've ridden 20Mm on an Alfine 8, for example, with no problems. 

For lightweight loads like the ones you're talking about it doesn't matter. That's well within the design limits of all the commercial trikes I'm aware of, and it's quite reasonable if you're building your own. You're better to focus on a trike that works for you in other respects, I think. 

It should be possible to repair the frame, the big question is whether you'll be able to find a replacement tube or will you have to make it yourself. Making the tube isn't hard, it's just messy. The repair will involve cutting out the damaged tube, working out what else (if anything) is damaged, and paying careful attention to the other tubes. Then once you're clear on exactly what needs to be done (and that the person paying for it is happy with the price) you start. This may end up cutting an undamaged tube so that the new tubes can be fitted, depending on just how rigid the frame is (it should not be that rigid unless you have a very short tube) 

The description is of the chain width. There's quite a lot of history, but the short answer is "they make chains narrower to fit more gears in". In order to fit more rear sprockets in without making the rear wheel ludicrously wide manufacturers have crammed them closer together. To make that work they've made the chain narrower, limited mostly by material strength (for a given cost and manufacturing complexity, anyway). One consequence of this is that front chainrings also have to be narrower, but there's enough tolerance there that you can usually run a chainring one step wider than ideal and get away with it. Running a narrower chainring than you need will almost always work, but since they're usually more expensive that's not often done (except for people running 7 speed setups where the cheap chainrings are 8/9 speed these days) Most chains are the same length when sold, with extra links discarded when the chain is fitted. Most bike shops have a bin of those offcuts and use them to replace broken links or if someone is especially poor they can stitch together a full chain out of the bits (it's very slow and many modern chains are not designed to be assembled without special joining pins). The problem is for people with folding bikes that often have longer than usual chains, as the standard size is frequently a few links sort of what they need. Recumbents obviously suffer from this to an even greater degree, taking between 2.5 and 3.5 chains. SRAM and others sell chain in rolls which mitigates this problem, but obviously you'd need to be using a lot of chain to justify buying it 100m at a time.
