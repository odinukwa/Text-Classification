French guy here. A few years ago, I've been in the exact same situation you describe, and I made the mistake of signing. The problem you'll find if you sign is not necessarily that you won't get part of your pay sooner or later. That contingency would at least prove manageable in some way. No, the real problem here is that by offering this proposal to you, they do nothing but prove a serious and irretrievable lack of culture about what is a software developer and how he works. They pretend to be a startup, but they do apply fundamentally "agency-like" reasonings. They even confessed not being capable of managing and motivating developers (the last one, in their terms, came to "do what he wanted and show only when he pleased"). Knowing nothing about software development, they want to have a trigger to better control you and better pressure you, if only unconsciously, so that you'll be tempted to shut your mouth if problems arise. And if you don't, they'll cut your pay, knowing that it would be an enormous pain in the ass for you to go legal about it (long procedures, nothing to be gained in the end...). Been there, done that. Run from this toxic environment, and find a true "startup". -- Responding to your update Your update makes me think that they felt your hesitation and changed their discourse. Remember their initial idea was of a punishment in case of professional fault. This is what they're really thinking about, even if they changed the wording afterwards. Otherwise, why would they have even mention this possibility in the first place? Additionally, their criterias ("respect of rules, implication, motivation") are all subjective: 

and of course you've realized that sometimes that "passion" plays out in unproductive ways. I understand why the scenarios you've given feel like personal attacks, but in many of these cases the solution is to not engage. Make this your mantra: Discussion is healthy, spreading knowledge is great, but you don't owe Joe an explanation. 

It's your boss's job to decide what priorities are and when to cut losses. Sometimes the right thing to do is to discard completed work and shift directions. You might gently conclude that you either have a performance problem (too much waste due to thrashing requirements) or a communication/morale problem (the in-the-trenches programmers don't understand why their effort is being wasted/ignored). 

I suspect that this manager may not be amendable to constructive criticism, but if you are interested in a non-adversarial approach you could attempt to schedule a short, 10-minute face-to-face meeting and outline your concerns privately. 

As many others have said, no one will care whether you eat the company's catered lunch or bring your own lunch from home. But there's more to it than that. Based on your statements: 

This one is interesting. You need to genuinely answer the question, "why do I care?" Is overhearing the conversation a waste of your subordinates time? Then tell Joe you'd like to move this conversation to a different place to avoid wasting their time. Is overhearing the conversation going to confuse your subordinates? Then definitely tell him you'd like to move the conversation to avoid confusion. Are you worried that others will get the wrong idea about you? Try to relax and realize you can't control other people's feelings toward you. Maybe he's wrong. Maybe he's right and you should change. Maybe he's right but changing would be too costly at this point. Learn what you can. 

To me, it simply looks like you've got bored to death with your job. You already proved you can do what's expected from you now and now it's done you don't have the energy to repeat yourself. The good news is it's a sign of intellectual strength - you're just not a code monkey and you can deliver only when the job represents a challenge to you. So go ahead and talk with your boss, but not about your underperformance. Rather about the fact that you performed really well with your current level of assignments, and that your boss could use this ability to a higher level. Your sense of guiltiness may not come from your underperformance but from your inability to take a bold move and say : 

It's also possible that you don't have any room for evolution in this particular company, in which case you should leave. It's also possible that you don't want to do something radically different, you just don't feel like working in that team or on that project or in that company anymore. Perhaps it's the neighbourhood, the color of the walls, perhaps it's something else; anyway your feelings of boredom and guiltiness are telling you that you don't want to keep on those tracks anymore. Do you see yourself stuck in that situation, having to do something that doesn't bring you any fun by now, and does not challenge your intellect anymore to the point that you're just bored to death about it, afraid to talk about your boredom with your boss, until you retire? If not, it might indeed be time to make a change. 

I think you and your boss need to have a better understanding about your expected role in meetings. Let's say you're the Sharepoint technical expert. When you are meeting with customers (or "customers") about whether or not to use Sharepoint, the customers can't/won't care about what the Sharepoint expert has to say until after they've actually agreed that using Sharepoint is the correct course of action. Why are you going to these meetings? 

It sounds like you're in proximity to a somewhat toxic situation, you're pretty low on the totem pole, and your boss(es) don't particularly care about this problem. You also say you don't want drama. How can I distance myself from these people while maintaining professionalism? You don't have to. Your other coworkers aren't going to automatically lump you in with the clique. They probably already know all about the obnoxious behavior. As long as you don't join in their conversations or go to lunch with them, they won't see you as part of that subculture. Even if, you started associating with them throughout some portion of your first 5 months but have since stopped, your adult, professional coworkers won't hold it against you. They understand that you were still figuring things out. You don't have to give anyone an obvious cold shoulder nor any other elaborate theatrics. If a clique member sends you a nasty IM or makes a rude comment, simply respond noncommittally and don't pursue the conversation further. The clique members will stop making overtures, meanwhile no one who's watching will care. 

There are two things to consider and as requested, I'll try to make a general answer. First, the question of how will you get your first contract. Freelancers usually use references and previous work to get contracts. You claim you have no references in this field and no "real" previous work. So you can count only on your persuading skills. You should begin with small projects first so that you can easier convince a potential customer to go with you, and it will allow you to build a portfolio which can get you more contracts later. Second, the question of how you will manage to satisfy your first customer. Suppose you managed to get a contract, congrats: 1/10 of the work is done. Because now you have to deliver so that this first experience translates into a reliable reference. All that said, regarding your question or whether "you're ready or not" - I've seen many freelancers claiming to be "experts" in such field, and it appeared they were really not that proficient. It doesn't mean that you have to do the same and it's not intended to make people lower their mediocrity acceptance threshold. Just that if you have sufficient soft skills and you kind-of know your way in the technical stuff you want to use, then it seems quite doable to get your first contracts. Technically speaking, don't listen to people bashing at freelancers who are in the habit of "learning stuff at the expense of their customers". People (freelancers, employee) are always learning things at the expense of their customers/employers. Except the ones that decide to settle. 

Context I am new to client relations. It's my first year at my company, but even though I am 24 years old, I've never had a job where I had to do customer service of any kind. I program things and often times I need to leave notes for the client or talk to them directly. We work together and we each have our assigned tasks. My Issue The current project I'm working on involves a system we set up to allow the client to write copy directly into the program using XML. That way, if something needs changing, they don't have to wait for me to change some string within the program, they can edit it directly and see the changes live on the build. Every week or so, there are bug notes in the production journal that the client has found, so that I can fix them before the next build. Frequently however, there are bug notes involving the copy itself, things like "Change this word to X" or "Add a line after this sentence: ". I want to know how I can let the client (or this specific person) know that those bugs are their job to take care of. I'm a little annoyed by these notes but I don't want that to bleed through into my notes. I also don't want to do these myself because we have reasons for why tasks are given to whom, and I don't want these tasks to be assumed to be mine by mistake. I work in a small company, about 10 people. This project is 2 people, myself and my boss, who is the owner and the one that finds our clients and makes the deals that get us money. No customer service department. I asked my boss, he said I should indicate which bugs are their responsibility, so I want to let them know in the best way. How can I tactfully, respectfully let the client know that these notes are irrelevant to me and are actually one of their member's jobs? 

My main point is: nowadays a lot of people (especially here on the Workplace - see the current most upvoted answer) tend to confuse being an employee and being an associate. Employers take advantage of this confusion. Don't fall into that trap. Forget the BS about "team spirit", "we're in the same boat", etc. This is just marketing (directed towards employees). If your employer wants you in his boat, he has to make you an associate. Employee: you're paid for a task. The company's interests are not your interests. Once the task is done, you're done. The amount of time you put into it doesn't count. Associate: the company's interests are your interests. Act accordingly. 

Remember that as a recruiter/boss/manager, it's his job to look friendly/honest/fine in order to keep people coming to work at his place. In no case it means that he really is. Makes me think of people who buy something because "the salesman was nice and appeared honest". Yeah, it's just his full-time job to appear nice and honest. 

Those criterias have no solid foundation at all, and are in no way related to the quality of the work you'll provide. Lastly, you say: 

Answer is quite simple here, really. Just leave this company right away and never look back. If you stay, you’re doing a massive disservice to yourself and to the whole community of developers at large, by sending the message that among this community, there are people willing to encounter such ridiculous conditions without running away on the spot, no questions asked. 

Joe is expressing his frustration that he won't have the deliverable. Maybe he's even correct. Maybe the head of the company made a dumb decision. But if Joe is owed an explanation, it won't come from you; it will come from the company head. 

Say out loud that the background is more complicated than he might realize, filling him in on the details is a lengthy process, and remind him that it was your decision to make. If nobody else on the team is interested, then the issue dies there. If others are interested, decide as a group when and who will participate in further discussion and table it until then. 

There's no one-size-fits-all answer here. It depends on you, and it depends on the company culture. Don't muddy the issue with talking about macronutrients, or almost-vegetarianism, or food morals, or bringing your lunch from home sometimes--no one is going to have issues or questions about that. Figure out what the company's expectations are, decide how often you'll want to leave, decide how important your lunchtime breaks are, and try to gauge whether you and the company will be a good fit. 

It's a great discussion question for friends or colleagues with mutual interests and experience, but a terrible interview question. Ultimately, asking this question will fail to generate information useful for making a hiring decision. It's similar to "show me a piece of writing you like." If a question this broad is posed in a no-pressure circumstance, like chatting with a new acquaintance, you could go in so many directions: the funny children's book you read last night with your daughter, the magazine article about the Greek debt crisis, the easy YA book you took to the beach, or your favorite work of classical literature. No matter which way you go, you can have a nice discussion with a someone--but if you talk about children's books, your new friend isn't going to learn anything about your ability to grapple with the themes of Moby Dick. Presupposing that a candidate can show you the code and remain relatively nonplussed (see footnote, the stress imposed alone should make the question non-productive), your conversation could touch on one or more of the following (but not all!):
