The first thing you need to know is that reputation counts for nothing in philosophy. In philosophy we do not recognise authority or standing when it comes to assessing the strength of an argument or the validity of a viewpoint. It is true that faith or belief in a loving God can give meaning to your life; your life makes sense in terms of a relationship, which you believe to exist, with a loving God. So faith in a loving God is in this sense sufficient for life to have (a sense of) meaning. I can see no basis, though, for saying that it is necessary. Life can have, or be perceived to have and experienced as having, meaning even if there is no God, higher power, supreme being or whatever and no belief in the same. Meaning, or a sense of meaning, can derive from a broad variety of sources - family, personal relationships, a life project or career, and even political or social activism. Take personal relationships : If I love my partner then this gives an enormous sense of meaning to my life. I see love as a self-validating good; whatever the situation, if love is present this is always one good element in it. And this is so whether there is a God, a higher power, supreme being or even a Devil ! From the other side, if my love is returned this is a huge source of validation from another person. How can a life of mutual love, or even one-sided love, lack meaning ? It is said that 'God is love' : but why can't love be a value that gives meaning to life even if there is no God ? 

I think we can usefully put Rawls to work here and use his distinction between a concept and a conception (Theory of Justice). ▻ CONCEPT OF MERITOCRACY The concept of meritocracy does have a pretty uniform, independent meaning. This meaning is captured by Norman Daniels : 

Postmodernism is an abstraction. There are only postmodern theorists; and if we look at the major postmodern theorists we find a definite, non-nihilistic ethical dimension to their work. The following extract, backed up by references. provides ample evidence : 

There is always more than a little risk in interpreting Nietzsche. On my understanding of 'The Genealogy of Morals', genealogy is more than an investigation into origins. It does involve an inquiry into origins, however. Nietzsche does want to know what has produced morality, what it is that has given rise to it. If Nietzsche were offering merely a myth or speculation to explain the origins of morality, he would not go into so much historical detail. (He is not offering the kind of myth or speculation that Rousseau uses in 'Origins of Inequality' to explain the institution of property and the source of certain social emotions such as vanity and envy.) His concern with the origins and history of moral values is evident when he talks of the 'need to know about the conditions and circumstances under which the values grew up, developed and changed ... [W]e have neither had this knowledge up till now nor even desired it' (GM, Preface, §6 : Nietzsche, 'On the Genealogy of Morals', tr. C. Diethe, Cambridge : 1997, 8.) But genealogy means more than this quest for origins. Nietzsche also wants (a) to examine the value of morality as currently understood, to see whether it genuinely contributes to human flourishing : 'So let us give voice to this new demand : we need a critique of moral values, the value of these values should itself, for once, be examined' (GM, Preface, §6: Nietzsche, 'On the Genealogy of Morals', tr. C. Diethe, Cambridge : 1997, 7.) He also (b) asks what authority morality has. He wants to uproot the idea that morality derives from some supernatural or other authority. We tend to think of moral judgements as truths but we practise a kind of self-deception about their status. 'In practice it means that moral judgments are torn out of the conditionality they grew from and within which alone they make sense, out of their Greek and Greek-political soil, and, under the semblance of sublimation, are denaturalized. The great concepts "good," "just"are severed from the preconditions they belong to, and as "ideas" set free they become the objects of dialectic. One seeks a truth behind them, one takes them as entities or as signs of entities: on e fabricates a world where they are at home, from which they originate [wo sie herkommen ]' (NL 1888: 14[111] - NL = Nachlass = Notes. We treat moral values, those we have inherited, as objective and moral judgements as true. Often we see them (or did in Nietzsche's time) as divine commands, as having a supernatural origin. In fact they are just remnants of an older civilisation. As such they have no authority. We are free to create our own values. This is partly what Nietzsche has in mind when he talks of a 'transvaluation of all values'. If this is clear, you may now understand why Nietzsche used 'genealogy' of morals instead of 'origins'. 

Does it follow, because and if falsehood of belief or utterance is impossible, therefore lying is impossible ? Lying involves an intent to mislead. Suppose, what is logically possible, that all liars intend to mislead but always, by incompetence or a misunderstanding of language, tell the truth ? On this scenario falsehood might still be impossible yet there remain plenty of liars. On this basis Socrates' reply, to counter the claim that falsehood is impossible, that there are plenty of liars would prove nothing against the impossibility of falsehood. Cratylus only says that falsehood is impossible. On my line of argument, he need not therefore say that lying is impossible. The quotation from the 'Parmenides' equally relies strictly on the impossibility of falsehood, not on the impossibility of lying as characterised by the intent to mislead. 

▻ THE PROBLEM OF COMPARISON The conceptual and cultural contexts of Aristotle’s and Rawls’ thought diverge so widely that comparison between them is no straightforward task. A major difference is, however, that Aristotle believes that there is a substantive and objective human good – the perfect development of our true nature – which ‘turns out to be activity of the soul in accordance with virtue’ (to anthropinon agathou psuches energeia ginetai kat’ areten) : Nicomachean Ethics, I.7 1098a16-17 : J. Barnes, ed., The Complete Works of Aristotle, II, 1735). Politics should be geared to the promotion of this development. In contrast Rawls, while not denying the existence or possibility of a substantive and objective human good, does not believe that politics can run on it. There is no decision procedure by which to determine the matter; and even if there were, we are faced with the fact of pluralism, that is with the fact of widespread and entrenched disagreement about whether there is such a good and if so what it is. So he defines in A Theory of Justice principles on which he believes that citizens can agree whatever their disparate conceptions of the human good. Among these principles is the so-called Difference Principle, which states that: 'Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are ... to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged ‘ (A Theory of Justice, 83). Rawls does not assume that there must be social and economic inequalities. The Difference Principle is hypothetical : if there are such inequalities they must work to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged. It is fair to add that Rawls does appear to expect such inequalities but they are not intrinsic to his theory. ▻ THE POSSIBILITY OF COMPARISON There is no chance that we will get a precise interlock between the Difference Principle and anything Aristotle says, assumes or implies. But we can read Aristotle in the light of the Difference Principle and not come away empty-handed. ☛ Slaves It might readily be supposed that Aristotle violates the Difference Principle by his acceptance of slavery. Certainly the social and economic arrangements of the polis, the city-state of Aristotle’s time, did not operate to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged if the least advantaged were captured slaves or their children (slaves by convention). But Aristotle defends, not slavery of the captured enemies and such like, but ‘natural slavery’. A natural slave is someone who is inherently incapable of managing their own lives and needs for their own benefit to controlled and directed by another. For such persons slavery is ‘expedient and right’ (Politics, I.5 1255a2; Barnes, II, 1991). There are reasonable grounds, then, for saying that if there are natural slaves their condition of subordination is to their greatest benefit. Their lives would go much worse if they were left to their own devices. ☛ Women It is widely assumed that Aristotle confines women to household management and procreation and excludes them from politics. If this assumption is correct, then women are among the least advantaged and Aristotle would appear to do little, in fact, nothing for them. But the question of Aristotle’s political attitude to women is really quite complicated. This is clear from the following extract from Harold L. Levy : 

Where there is disagreement, as there is between rationalists and empiricists, there is always a background of agreement : there can only be disagreement if you at least agree on what there is to disagree about. So much by way of sage introduction ! ▻ RATIONALISM I'd offer a provisional characteristisation of rationalism as a philosophy for which reason is a source of knowledge of the physical world independent of and superior to empirical observation in the form of sense perception or introspection. 'Superior to' indicates that reason can supply beliefs which are immune from error. A rationalist accepts the possibility and fact of a priori knowledge, knowledge derived by reason independently of (prior to) experience. Reason may operate independently of experience by virtue of innate ideas but a rationalist is not as such committed to the existence or reliability of innate ideas. There has historically been an assumption, or tendency to suppose, that knowledge of physical world takes a mathematical form. ▻ EMPIRICISM For empiricism there is no knowledge independently of experience. The closest we can come to a priori knowledge is a knowledge of analytic truths - knowledge for instance of tautologies. This tells us nothing about reality, only at most some truths about language or concepts. All knowledge of the physical world derives from empirical observation in the form of sense perception or introspection. Empiricism is not closely associated with the view that a knowledge of the physical world takes a mathematical form. ▻ GENERALISATION I have only been able to offer a wide and approximate contrast between rationalism and empiricism. There is really not way round looking at individual thinkers and seeing what they agreed and differed on. ▻ COMMONALITIES ☛ Direct perception and certainty The 'reason' on which rationalism relies is not necessarily or even usually deductive, inferential, 'discursive' reasoning - the deduction of a conclusion from premises. It is often, as we see clearly in Descartes, rational intuition or insight. Rationalists use deduction but Descartes' 'Meditations' and to an extent his 'Rules for the Direction of the Mind' run on intuitions - the products of mental acts by which we perceive directly and with absolute objective certainty*, without the aid of empirical observation, some particular truth. [* Certainty is ambiguous between (psychological) 'absolute conviction' and (epistemological)'immunity from error'. I use the term in the second sense.] Direct perception also plays its part in empiricism but not perception of the intuitive kind. If, for instance, it appears to me that I am looking at a tree, then it is certain that that is how things appear to me. Even if I am hallucinating, it is still certain that it appears to me that I am looking at a tree. Without further analysis, Descartes regarded such empirical certainty as too thin to support the edifice of knowledge; Meditation I shows how sense-based certainty can go along with epistemological unreliability. How things appear, whatever the fact of our experience, is no sure guide to how they really are. ☛ Individualism In Descartes on the one hand on the rationalist side, and on the other Locke and Hume on the empiricist, there is a kind of epistemological individualism. Locke is careful, or tries to be, to admit no truth which does not recommend itself to his own mind. Descartes, equally, commits himself to not accepting as true anything which he does not clearly apprehend to be such. Hume keeps closely to beliefs which he can justify in terms of his own 'impressions and ideas'. ☛ Rationalism does not exclude the empirical totally Observation, sensation, and experiment - which clearly belong to the world of experience - are by no means excluded from the Cartesian search for knowledge. Descartes never says that we or he can build an adequate body of knowledge without any reference to the senses. It is just that the contribution of the senses is either unnecessary or highly unreliable at the deepest, foundational level of knowledge. The foundations of knowledge are supplied by clear and distinct ideas derived from intuition working in the 'natural light' (lumen naturale) of reason. There is plenty of room for observation, sensation, and experiment but only insofar as their results can be justified by derivation from or consistency with foundational clear and distinct ideas. 

It is true that Tucker himself rejects this interpretation but van de Veer's article argues back hard; and I think the Tucker quotation does, despite Tucker, represent Marx's view. In regard to 'egalitarianism', it is relevant to quote Marx's two formulas of justice. In socialist society dissimilar amounts of goods will be distributed to different labourers under the rule [implicit in Marx, 'Critique of the Gotha Program, 1875, The Marx and Engels Reader, 2nd ed., ed. R. Tucker, NY : W.W. Norton, 1978, 531] : 'to each according to his labour'. This rule is only provisional. Under communism a different rule will apply : 

Some of the language here is unhelpful : 'in the second a particular is mentioned and the nature or part of the nature of another particular which is present in it is specified'. But the basic picture is clear : When 'is a man' is predicated of Socrates, his essential nature is specified; it is the essential, not incidental, to nature of Socrates that he is a man. In other words, Socrates would not be what he essentially is if he were not a man. In contrast when 'is white' is used to describe Socrates, whiteness is merely incidentally 'present in' Socrates. He could be pink or blue and still be Socrates. To take up your comments : whiteness is 'present in' Socrates but not as an essential part of his nature - in this sense 'not as a part'. Man or manhood is predicated of Socrates but whiteness inheres in men and other things. Not in all men but only in some, incidentally including Socrates. Whiteness 'cannot exist separately from what it is in' : no men and other things, no whiteness.

I recognise the phenomenon you refer to. I think the closest relevant classificatory term is 'interactionism' or 'social interactionism' as developed by GH Mead in the early 20th century and, naturally, later developed, refined and qualifed by others. In the interaction with the policeman you are a subject, an I that perceives, thinks, imagines, and so on : but you have also become an object to yourself through and as a result of the interaction. As encountered by the policeman you are an object regarded as a suspect; and this now becomes a new part of your 'presented self'. You experience yourself as an object of police suspicion and as one treated like a criminal. If this analysis is on anything on the right lines for you, then mead's 'interactionism' seems the right term. REFERENCES G.H. Mead, Mind, Self, and Society, ed. by Charles W. Morris.

1 Something is possible if it is actual. In this sense the actual world is a possible world. 2 By contrast something is also possible if it is not actual but (not 'imaginable' - too psychological a notion and too vague) but maximally consistently describable. If we posit a conjunction of states of affairs, objects, properties, and laws of nature or randomness, and whatever else you want to include in your ontology, of the totality of which a non-self-contradictory set of descriptions can given, then we have a possible world. I would locate the key to possibility, at least in regard to possible worlds, in maximal and non-self-contradictory (i.e. consistent) description. 3 I don't understand what a possible world would be like if its maximal description involved self-contradiction. I do not rule it out entirely but I exclude it until persuaded how such a world would be possible.
