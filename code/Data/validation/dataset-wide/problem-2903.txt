Obviously this will largely be opinion, but my answer is yes. If we are referring to physically interacting with the past (even so much as breathing the air in an open field) then history will be changed from the one that spawned the original "you." Simply breathing the air exposes the past to your "future" virii/bacteria. Even assuming no people are around, there are plenty of living things that may prove an effective host. If you actually are around people, infection rates go up wildly (think Small Pox vs the Native Americans). Even bacteria thought harmless to you could reek havoc on past populations. Another example would be your natural bodily functions interacting with the environment. The food you eat while in the past is no longer there to be eaten. It seems like an inconsequential thing, but that means someone may now go hungry, might get food poisoning when they wouldn't have (or NOT get food poisoning), or have their daily activities significantly altered to procure food for you (or food for themselves to replace the food eaten by you). Even if you bring your own food, that is additional matter entering the environment (packaging, feces, et cetera) that wasn't there before, and could impact the past in a similar manner. Physically travelling into the past is wrought with "butterfly effect" issues. No matter how careful you are, it is likely going to make the future you left different than the one you return to. 

Ultimately, I think my position lies somewhere in the middle. While it is fine to act in accordance with a spiritual guide, and "do what you will", if you want to make a difference, you won't get far that way. You won't always feel like it, and your emotions will be conflicted, and for myself, the only way I will ever have the discipline to do anything is to set up my actions as a matter of my own integrity, and force myself to act no matter whether I feel like it or not. But at the same time, the internal pull to a particular cause can be dangerous, because coming from the wrong place, it can harm and ignore others, and even produce unexpected and undesirable results. I think it is essential to act on that which you choose to act on, not from obligation, but from a place of creativity and honesty. For example, it is not, "I think x about abortion, so I must do y". It is more like, "Given I think x about abortion, what could I do that would make a difference? What is the intention behind my opinion? Do I think that all people should be treated equally? Or is it that I want people to experience being taken care of? What can I do to fulfill on that? Do I want to do anything? Does it light me up?" It is essential to examine ones own motives. As Werner Erhard said, (paraphrasing): 

Assumes the cost of feigning belief is negligible Assumes penalties for non-worship are worse than those for worshiping the "wrong" deity Assumes "god" doesn't (or can't) differentiate between those with true belief versus those who are just hedging their bets Assumes "god" does not reward intellectual honesty 

It is possible to know a very limited set of things with absolute certainty, i.e. not dependent on basic fundamental assumptions that "could" end up being wrong. For instance, things I am absolutely certain about: 

It seems some great answers have been given, but just to add something else: Regardless of whether a scientific theory is later proven to be incorrect, the data and testing that previously supported that theory are still just as correct and useful. It is just our interpretation of that data which is brought into question. I feel this is important to mention, because I have often heard people mention that science's practice of regularly tossing out previously held beliefs means that it is inconsistent and untrustworthy. If tomorrow, the theory of gravity was proven to not be accurate in describing some newly discovered phenomenon, that does not make it any less accurate at describing the things it used to. It is no longer an all encompassing framework that can be used, but that doesn't change the fact that 99.9% of what it states remains true. 

I think the difficulty in answering this question both validates the question and negates it at the same time. To even begin, we must ascertain what we mean by truth. Can anything actually be seen as a permanent infallible truth? Try as we might, we can only get perspectives; points of view; opinions. Even something trivial like "You need water to live", is just a highly probable assumption based upon considerable evidence and experience. It is not possible to know with certainty whether or not we have considered all points; whether there is something not yet understood or considered. Also trueness or truth ignores the passage of time as a contingency. Whether something is or is not true right now and whether or not it will be true tomorrow, are two different - even at times contradictory - assessments. From a philosophical standpoint, it is impossible to speak of truth or untruth without contradicting your own logic. Like Alan Watts said, "It's like trying to bite your own teeth or look at your eyes without a mirror." But...only from a philosophical standpoint. I have found the following way of thinking to serve me well. I think it is critical to question and pull apart my own assumptions. The more radically, I can disrupt my own habitual patterns of static assumption and certainty, the more space I have to consider and to see my own erroneous views. It is the same principal as solving a Koan. However, that said, John Stuart Mill stated (the only useful thing he ever said), "There is not certainty, but there is certainty sufficient for human life". And that's about right. If you don't pull apart the illusions that blind you, you will never know what's possible beyond "truth" - but if you try and walk on water before you can clearly see that it's not true that you can't, then you will drown quickly. That there is nothing true should become common sense if you think on it, but the way in which you use that thought or that thought uses you is what is critical. 

Difference between science knowledge and religious knowledge? Scientific Knowledge: A set of models which may be used to explain and predict the the universe around us. Includes the process necessary to verify and add to that body of knowledge. Understanding the world around us, and the underlying rules which governs it, is paramount. Religious Knowledge: Generally, the memorization, understanding, and strategies for adherence to a set of tenants and/or moral rules (usually) connected to the belief in a specific deity or enlightened being. Belief that everything in the world is operating within a divine plan of some sort is typical. This type of knowledge is often focused on how best best to remain in compliance with these tenants, and apply them to day-to-day existence. 

Given your reply to #4, I'd label you as a person regardless of your personal feelings on the matter. You can call yourself a dog, a duck, or the Queen of England if you like, but being 99.99999999997% human means the 'human' label is most appropriate in my assessment. I wouldn't mind also supporting your claim to the dog label. You obviously feel it applies to you, and having been born a dog does support it. 

Humans tend to track time in a cyclical manner (clocks, seasons, calendars, etc) because that is how we experience it. The earth spins around the sun in a stable orbit, causing our environment oscillate through a predictable pattern of environmental states. And people are really good at identifying patterns. But that is just our earth-bound perspective, biased heavily by our position on a spinning, wobbly rock. A society living on non-orbiting rogue planet would likely have a very different view of the passage of time, and I doubt it would resemble our cyclical time/date keeping devices. (tl;dr, our way of measuring time has little to do what time actually "is," as opposed to our perspective of it. Whether time is a block or a parrot, our view from the inside makes it difficult to accurately determine much about it.) 

I like how you broke it down in that fashion. And it's a great question. I have struggled with this myself. There are lot of different contexts from which one can approach this question. I don't know the answer, but I know several ways of looking at the question that might be valuable. 

Yet this strays from my point. I've found that when people find fault with the beliefs of another, in the words of James Carse: 

Do you believe that your position on abortion is something that you believe should be a universal law? Do you think it is an unquestionably good position for all? Does it align with a pre-existing universal truth? (For example, Never Lie). If so, you are, for the most part, obligated to act in accordance with your position. Kant is too heavy to capture in a paragraph, but the above isn't a terrible intro. I think Kant is limited and deliberately ignores realities that he doesn't like, but for the most part, you won't damage yourself following his philosophy. 

Where did you arrive at this conclusion? There is nothing at all simplistic about this philosophy. Unless of course you consider something simplistic that does not claim to know or attempt to answer all questions definitively. Consider this quote from the Absurdism Wikipedia article referencing Camus on Elusion: 

It sounds like you're referring to the "Law of Cause and Effect," which tells us that every material effect has a prior cause. I counter that your question is an example of special pleading, suggesting that everything requires a cause, except for this super special uncaused cause which started everything. Either every "cause requires a cause" or "not every cause requires a cause." Either all causes were caused by a prior event, meaning the uni-multi-ultraverse model you propose is perpetual, or not every cause requires a prior cause which means there is no need for a special snowflake "initial cause" needing to "choose" to start things off. Anyway, modern science (and the Law of Cause and Effect) only offer models for how reality operates in our present universe. As such, it does not (necessarily) apply before our universe existed, and may not have even applied during the initial moments after the big bang. Our scientific models of the universe do not speak to how things worked before the big bang, and currently the only thing we know about things before planck time are that things certainly did NOT operate according to the same rules ($URL$ 

2.) That the standard conventions of war should not be applied to the Taliban (who the U.S. declared war in in 2002), just because of an arbitrary political designation of "terrorist" is in play I propose that "not negotiating with terrorists" is a political tool to attack opponents more than an actual standard to govern by, and as such isn't suitable to actually adhere to. (Yeah, probably wrong area for this question. I already worked up my response so going to leave it.) 

Simply put. To attempt to avoid the absurd, shield yourself from it one way or another, is to willingly blind yourself to what is right in front of you. It isn't to say that there isn't incredible and immense joy to be found in this life, but without seeing what's true (I mean this at the most basic level, like I am certainly going to die at some point;or I keep worrying, but I don't know what is going to happen tomorrow;), one invents or subscribes to myths - taking them as facts - and sees life through the filter of those myths. To embrace the absurd is to see the fantasies you create about reality (to create stories about our lives is a seemingly inescapable aspect of being human) as fantasies; as nothing more than fiction, and then to love the fantasies and be their author rather than being a mere instrument of some novel written by someone else (God?). Seeing life as it is and as it isn't without adding anything or garnishing the future with hopeful thoughts allows one to go beyond the absurd. The best quote I could find to illustrate the real power of the Absurdist viewpoint is by James Carse: 

Without a set of rules existing beyond mankind to hold to (e.g. religion), it is difficult to imagine an objective answer to this question. If the purpose of life isn't assumed to come from some "greater being", then it is inherently a personal matter. That being said, Secular Humanism is probably your best bet for an objective look at these questions. Essentially, it is the logical continuation of the inherent biological motivations which have gotten mankind to this point. In that context, the purpose would be to perpetuate the species. Progress the body of human knowledge which has done such an efficient job at making us the top organism on the planet. Ensure the continued habitability of the environment and/or solve the problems keeping mankind from inhabiting other planets. Are those objectively correct? I'd say no, but I think it's about as close as you'll get without the referencing a deity of some variety. 

In a word, No. Pascal's wager makes a number of assumptions which our hypothetical Strong Agnostic should question: 

tl;dr - Scientific knowledge is concerned with how the world works now, and reliably predicting how it will operate in the future. Religious knowledge assumes the existence of a some manner of greater being, and is focused on determining/acting according to it's will. When we have reached the limits of our (current) scientific knowledge, people often rely upon Religious knowledge rather than saying, "I don't know." 

I'm not sure what you mean when you say, . Much of how I would respond would be determined by the context in which your question is asked, but as a stand alone argument, "How can death matter to the dead person?" is solid; it just depends upon what it is being used to argue for. We can assume that this paper doesn't expect the post-death states (hell/heaven) to exist - or at least that they are not relevant for his argument. So we can cross those out - or at least we should cross them out if we are going to find a logical place to stand in defining a response. It is not wrong to consider hell or heaven as a counterpoint, but they are only useful in poking holes in the argument - the existence of heaven or hell is not known and therefore shouldn't be the backbone of any refutation. Aside from that, there are several points to consider: Does it matter if all plant and animal life dies out? The answer is less obvious than the author of the essay suggests. On one hand, if we all die simultaneously without any pain or suffering, then to every human being it should matter exactly none. Why? "How can death matter to a dead person?" There is no one left to suffer the loss of anyone else, and thus there is no one left to suffer; no resounding pain; no sense of loss; just silence. I have often thought to myself that the thought of my own death seems sad - if only for the mental image I have of people suffering after I'm gone. But if I die AND so does everyone else; there is no sadness. It just is. That said; the author's definition of mattering is unclear. Upon inspection, the 'not mattering' argument can be used anywhere. If human life seems to matter - does that lack consequences apart from those felt by other humans? If so, then it doesn't matter if I suffer - since my suffering will surely cease when I die - and so forth. If we elevate as the pinnacle of all , then we can argue that live or die, nothing matters at all, since we are inherently insignificant - so much so that as soon as our species disappears, goes with it. In other words; if the only thing that matters is what matters to humans; then what matters doesn't matter that much at all. If, however, we allow for the possibility that while human is important to humans, there maybe greater than those we can observe from our constrained human viewpoint, then perhaps the death of all life on earth matters a great deal. We can't know this either way; and the author knows this. What we can know is that one's being and existence can be given by the perspective that they subscribe to. The being and existence of one who believes that all life dying would be superior to somebody dying is going to be different than the being and existence of one who considers that there is some greater that gives human existence value. I don't know which way of being would be preferable, or whether either view provides an obvious state of existence that accompanies said view; I can only infer that one's existence would differ depending where they stood.
