Is there something that the business could do to have less bugs? Maybe cleaning up technical debt? Maybe recruiting specific people to test software? Maybe less tight deadlines? If you would like any of those things to happen in your organisation you could bring it up when the person asks you to produce fewer bugs. 

Having common sense means that you don't try to guess what the manager wants you to do but you think about the problem you are facing yourself. Having to micromanage you by telling you exactly what you have to to do takes energy for the manager. Simply delegating the task in trusting you to figure out what's reasonable to do takes less time and energy for the manager. 

If you are interviewing a person who already worked as an Info Sec. analyst, they should be able to come up with a past situation and tell you what they did. 

Try to understand what your boss wants. They probably want to project a professional image. She probably also doesn't want to spend her time with thinking about a different uniform for yourself. Do they want an employee that looks discomfortable in the uniform he's wearing? Probably not. The boss has an interest that you project a good image. This means that you do best to try to find a look that works. Talk with coworkers about what they would consider to be good. Then make your case that it's also in the interest of the company that you wear that uniform. 

It depends on why you are contacting the person. Let's say you contact me, because I wrote some open source code and published it on github. You have some feature request. If you address me with I would find that strange and give your email less attention than if you would address me with my first name or don't start with any greeting. Most emails that start with "Dear Sir or Madam," that I get from people I don't know are spam. It's different if you contact someone in his role as employee of a company. In that case you can be more formal. 

Why doesn't the firm want you to publish the problem? If you publish it, it's likely that other people they give the same assignment will find the post when they use Google. That means the question becomes worthless as a good interview question for them. That means publically posting on Code Review StackExchange might hurt the company. However if you haven't sign a NDA then I wouldn't see a problem if you privately ask people you trust for feedback on the code. That's unlikely to hurt the company. 

The ethics would require that you get paid for what you have done. If you are faster than the average, increase your hourly rate so that the end payment is comparable. But do this before accepting a task. Doing it afterwards will only put you under a bad light. 

If your mind is really made up for leaving, there is no reason in playing with the fire and risking your perspective employer to doubt your commitment. If, as you say, it's the company tune that motivates you to leave, it is not an higher salary that will accommodate that. You are wasting time (yours, your current manager's, your future manager's) just to fiddle. If this comes to surface it won't praise your attitude. 

It simply says that you check your mailbox on Sunday. Executives in most of the companies are not bound to Monday-Friday 9-17 work schedule, so I think it is normal for them to send mail whenever they feel like doing it. It's up to you to set the boundaries on how you deal with those mails. You don't mention the executive ever pointed out a delayed answer to weekend mail, so it's not a big deal. 

Based on my experience one will always struggle with HR being non-technical: on one side they can be "too loose", like you experienced, or on the other side they can be "too strict" on certain keywords, neglecting synonyms. Just sit down with HR and give a factual feedback on the screening, mentioning the issues you have experienced: address the issues, don't blame the screener. Ask how can the position description can be improved to make them easier to filter the candidates, and use your examples as test cases. 

Well, if they keep asking and they keep getting the info they want (with the added value of not having to pay a dime), why should they stop bothering you? Politely answer that 

I have had colleagues in the Netherlands who changed job while being in therapy for burn out or other serious health conditions. As far as I know, it's not something that will prevent you from getting a job, as long as you are open about it with your employer. You may ask your doctor advices on how to handle it with your employer (he/she will surely have other patients in the same condition). Maybe you can settle to start working part time (0.6 or 0.8 FTE) and then gradually increasing your work load as your health situation improves. 

As others have already stated, getting yourself fired on purpose is a bad idea. Most of us work in a fairly specific job and people "in the industry" know each other. There are ways you could potentially get around the 4 weeks: -Have you accrued vacation time? Book 4 weeks off and show up on the first day of your holiday to give your 4 weeks' notice. -Does your prospective new employer know you have a 4 week notice period? It really depends on what the job is, how bad they want you and how hard it is to find someone who's almost as good as you, as well as how high up in the company is the person hiring you. For example, I've been hired directly by the CEO of a very rich, but very small (in terms of employees) company. I've also been hired by the #14 highest up in the HR department of a shitty, but massive conglomerate. Depending on the situation vis a vis, who wants you at the new company and how badly they want you, you may be able to ask them to help you negotiate an early release. Failing that, if you're honest about needing time to get started, is it out of the question that they wait a little bit for you? -Have you informed your current employer that you're unhappy? Have you informed them you're accepting another position? They may be sympathetic. Then again, you stated that you're unhappy with the work, and with the workplace. Is management part of what you're unhappy with? If so, would they be petty enough to torpedo you if you just spoke with them honestly about your concerns or about your plans? There are a myriad of possibilities that could come from speaking honestly with your boss, and a lot of information we don't have to help you predict what outcomes are most likely. Could or would they intentionally screw you over if they found out you were leaving? Could your current job become the job you want it to be? Is it possible that they'd fire you automatically upon receiving your notice? I once had a really bad day in a management position due to an incompetent sub-manager misplacing (on paper) almost $100k, adding a couple hours to my shift while my gf waited in the parking lot and I wrote my resignation letter right then and there. Turns out it was the unspoken policy of the company to pay out full severance to and fire on the spot any person at my level who put in their notice. I didn't know this beforehand, because they didn't want people taking advantage, but they also didn't want high-level people who weren't going to stay with the company to be on the premises. -How are your finances, how big is the company you want to go work for and how unique is this position? If for some reason you just can't get out of the job without trickery, the new job won't help you and won't wait for you either, how often does this job come up? Are we talking about going from McDonalds to KFC? Dishwasher to Fry cook? Mailroom to CEO? Is this a once in a lifetime opportunity to get your DREAM JOB or is it something that you could get hired on to next month, next year? If none of the other parties can work around you, can you afford to just quit, do your notice period and take your chances? Will you be effed if you leave this job and the new job falls through or can you afford to wait - unemployed - until you get what you want? To sum it up (honestly, I'm bad at summarizing, this might be just as long as the above) First, consider your situation. You know a lot that we don't, so our advice is worth less than you want it to be. Second, be honest about your situation, but decide who you should be honest with first. The new employer or the old. Who is more likely to help you? If it isn't the new job, I'm not sure why you're switching. Third, if you're committed, just do it. Be professional, but just go. Just say "I'm out, here's my notice." If they say "ok, see you for the next 20 work days," well that's just how it is. But maybe they'll say "you don't want to be here? K, FU den, gtfo, here yo money is, baibai!" Or some other unprofessional thing, and then you'll know you made the right decision. Fourth, (chronologically, but actually most important) believe in yourself. You got an offer for this job you want. If they won't wait for you, well screw 'em. Their competitors will hire you. Fifth and (FINALLY!) finally, grow the fuck up, man: Work sucks. I hate it. All the other people who have given you advice hate it, too. Even if it's your dream job. Even if it's your own business. Even if it's easy AF, it isn't doing what I want to do when I want to do it because I want to do it. We all get to a point in our lives when we realize what we don't like about our jobs isn't about the job but about ourselves. Ask yourself, is this a life lesson that you've learned yet? I mean really think about that. Do you hate your job because it's a bad job or do you hate your job because you haven't yet resigned yourself to the fact that people pay you for catering to their priorities and don't give the slightest fraction of a percentage of a shite what you think or how you feel? Cos that's how life works. I have 26 employees, and remembering having genuinely shitty bosses, I try and make things as good for them as I can, but at the end of the day, they do the job they agreed to do on contract-signing day or they worry about how to pay the bills, and I don't give a half a percent of a crap about which one they choose, because the wage I pay is way way more than fair for the work. No matter what you choose to do, in the end, be a grown-up about it and let us know how it went. 

One of my former employer (and owner of the small company where I was working) drove to work 2 days after getting hemorrhoids surgery, when he was supposed to lay flat in bed and rest. Reason? He thought that without him watching on us we would slack the entire day and steal time from the company. As an underling you can do pretty much nothing about this: anything you may say can trigger her paranoia into thinking you are plotting something against her, ending up in making your work life miserable. If the paranoid behavior is annoying you and affects your working, I suggest: Short term: try to make visible what and why you are doing things to deflect her paranoia from you. Long term: search for a more healthy employment. 

Whoever will handle your resume will only care of one thing: can he/she open the file to read it? As long as you send your resume in a format that is well known you should not really be worried about the editor you use. Also note that most online forms for applications allow you to attach a variety of file formats, among which .pdf is always present. Things might be a little different for a limited set of positions (i.e. Apple is known for "convincing" their employee to use only and always Apple devices, so I am not sure how a Word file would be perceived there). 

Stop covering the sh*t he makes. Let managers step on it and let him bear the consequences of his work. If you remove his accountability by filling the (alleged) gaps he creates, there is no way that the organization will feel the need to fix the issue. 

Goes along well with stating you agree with him. Stating that you are not contradicting him is a rather convolute way to express "I agree with you" and can surely take longer to be understood. 

As opposed to other answer, and also based on what I have done for positions I really cared about, I say there is no harm in asking a more detailed feedback on your rejection. Worst case is that they will ignore your request, best case is that you will get more information. Just mind that you phrase your request making clear you want to improve yourself, not judging their selection criteria. 

To optimize your effort, I suggest you take the no response as a lack of interest on your profile and move on. If you really want to show interest in the company/position, give a call before applying and ask some questions about the role. In this way when they see your CV they will already have you in their mind, and you will be "oh, this is that candidate who called me...".
