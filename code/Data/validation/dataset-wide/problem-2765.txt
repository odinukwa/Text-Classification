Aren't you confusing "existence" with "finite bodily existence" or "alive" in a modern materialist sense? Descartes has already abstracted away all his bodily senses before arriving at this essential point. Res cogitans also "exists" and is prior to res extensa. Existence and consciousness alike (our own or those of God and the Angels) are not confined to this mortal coil. Indeed, "mind" is an immaterial substance only hinged to material existence via, Descartes hypothesized, the pineal gland. As to your contrapositive, Kant argued that "existence" is not a proper predicate, which is partly why the ergo sum is not valid. 

I'm sorry, I cannot follow your argument. But I accept your conclusion. The problem lies, as far as I understand it,in the definition of dimensionality. Here are two common definitions. First, degrees of freedom. Ways or directions a "subject" could go. This is very messy, yet a largely satisfactory "phenomenological" understanding of the term. Second, "number of numbers" required to specify a point. This is an even messier definition, since "number" is ill-defined or controversial to begin with. Space and time are apples and oranges, as Bergson suggests. Not the same sorts of perspectives. The concept "dimension," under which they are placed, is in my own view fragile and corrupt. The word "dimension" and the whole concept badly needs redefinition. The mathematical definitions, as in string theory, are so far beyond intuition, so "formal" that the word "dimension" no longer makes physical sense. To adhere to some concept called "dimension," that applies to both "depth perception" and "temporal sequences" makes very little sense. 

While I agree the question is pretty faulty, there might be some ways to reasonably approach it. One needs a value system of some sort that is somehow measurable and arguably applies beyond the actual "human beings" who will be doing all the defining and measuring. This would require some sort of second-order, reflexive, or transcendental argument. We draw as close as "possible" to the singularity of the notorious "god's-eye-view," from which we abstract or bracket purely "human" interests. (In addition to theology and nihilism, there are various attempts in so-called speculative realism to present such conditionally "inhuman" thinking.) Candidates for extrapolated values might include biomass or sheer "quantity of life" or "diversity of life" or, more common, "reduction of suffering" or "acceleration of genealogical speed" or "interplanetary communications of lifeforms" or "time reversal" whatever. I am sticking with "life" here since it at least has some sort of directionality vis-a-vis entropy. These could then plausibly act as coordinate values within which "human life as we know it" is an independent variable. In fact, people do already think in terms of biodiversity and "total suffering" among sentient beings and so on. So some inchoate seeds of such "inhuman" values systems exist. And we have value systems in which both "life itself" and God or "Afterlife" or perhaps the Ubermensch are "more valuable" than mere "extant humanity" per se, which may disappear while the "value conditions" remain "post-human." Which is assumed delusional from our present physicalist dogmas. The problem is that conceding a minimal "value system" requires only some coordinates and a direction or "attractor," so dropping the "human" requirement gives us infinitely many, all seemingly meaningless. How to select? Most humans will undoubtedly vote in our own species "fruitful" self-interest, though something in us is strangely capable of imagining otherwise. There are certain very appalling moments in human history when I myself might be willing to let biomass prevail and plankton inherit the earth. 

The question so basic it "solves the most problems at once" is like the map with a perfectly accurate 1:1 scale. It solves no particular problems at all, echoing Wittgenstein's idea that philosophy, in answering its own questions, must "leave the world as it found it." That said, my own candidate would be the question: "What am I?" The reason is that it entails both ontology and epistemology, and contains an outwardly spiraling dialectic of "subject" and "object," self and world. In the manner of Hegel, it already describes consciousness as "self-consciousness." It reiterates the ancient imperative to "Know thyself," as well as the modern derivation of "Cogito ergo sum." It asks the very Heideggerian question: What is it that asks questions? I don't see how a question answering your question could get better than that. At least not in a neat three-word trinity, the minimal possible fully specified question. So I will be so bold as to claim it is the "best" answer to your question, or at least has the best pedigree. 

In practice there are many mixed forms of "democracy," "markets," and "socialism." But the idea there there is somehow an interdependence between a "free market" and "political freedom," is, in my view, utter propagandistic nonsense. The easiest error to point out is the idea of a "free market." There have always been "markets" but from the time of the East India Company up until the era of global banks, pharmaceutical patents, and multinational oil companies there is no "market" that is not founded, determined, and actively conditioned by state governments. The enormous sway of military defense contracts, the supplementation of corporate costs in everything from worker education and infrastructure to research, the massive tax costs entailed by registering, securing, recording, and protecting "property" of all sorts means that there is absolutely nothing "free" and "natural" about pricing. The most comprehensive example is simply the tax-bonded funding and private bank "pricing" of money credit itself, on which every other "price" is based. The most important U.S. historical example is agriculture, where extensive price intervention and government support was absolutely necessary to stabilize American farming, research, shipping, and food supply. Markets are creations of governments, and governments grow as markets grow. Markets, as well as political or military power, can also place severe constraints on "democracy." The ancient Athenians might be astonished at how few things we can vote on and that only "representatives" can actually vote on legislation. Other ancient governments might note that these "representatives" do not represent economic classes, but only regions. In sum, the the number of things we can actually vote on is extremely limited, often by markets interests, as is evident in things like wage laws, corporate legal exemptions, extended copyrights, and pharmaceutical patents. In history and practice there are many complex interactions of markets and democracy. To some extent they are interdependent, and it will be interesting to see how the China variation emerges. But the rigid linkage of "free" markets and political "freedom" is largely a Cold War goblin story, and it is always far easier and more controlling to erode the effectiveness of voting than to overtly curtail it. 

Logic is not "in" individuals but "between" them. It evolved out of "arguing" with "reasons;" that is, out of the various forms of dialectic in Greek legal systems, oratory, rhetoric, and drama. It seeks the "irrefutable argument," using Euclid's axiomatic system as model. What I believe is mistaken about your premise is the false dichotomy of "logic" and "illogical individuals." Logic evolves "between" individuals, who may instantiate it, to varying degrees, by way of a self-refining feedback loop. Thus we can have many "illogical" individuals and a formalized, even governing logic, as in Hegel's "cunning of reason." This view, I believe, maintains the link with human reasoning, while avoiding a direct equation of the two... or the Platonic concept of an independent, bodiless, mathematical logic. 

who are you calling mere? Though you seem to have some perfectly adequate answers here, I'll toss in my two cents. Your question is one (actually more than one) that appears in many guises in philosophy. You might wiki the "Swampman" argument by Donald Davidson, which addresses the role of continuous identity in consciousness and your "exact copy" of yourself. Many philosophers deny, on the basis of Leibniz's "identity of indiscernibles," also wikiable, or on the basis of simple physics that this idea of "exact copy" makes no logical sense to begin with. As to the question of physical brain states determining "thoughts," that is a long argument going back at least to Descartes or arguably Lucretius. I would question "mere" chemical reactions, since we are, so science tells us, biochemical-electromagnetic organisms interacting with various fields, with billions of parallel neural connections, giving rise to "emergent" and possibly "quantum" effects. Nothing "mere" about it. In such complex domains, even "hard sciences" find it doubtful that we can causally equate "same conditions" with "same outcomes." We can only measure "probabilistic" outcomes and never fully eliminate some level of randomness or indeterminacy. At the macrolevel we can talk about things being "the same" or "identical" or "continuous." But at the microlevel no subatomic state in the universe is ever really "the same." It is Heraclitean flux all the way down... which is what we mean by "time." So what "holds it together"? Fresh answers arise in the literature almost daily! If you are interested, one good introductory book on these kinds of groundwork problems is Think by Simon Blackburn, which has good overviews of the issues you address, not at all technical, but with references to some of the key historical philosophers, such as Descartes and Hume. And there are many other books as well. Please don't discover the final answer. You would put so many philosophers and scientists out of work...
