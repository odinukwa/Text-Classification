Filling Earth orbit with shrapnel would a terrible threat to Earth but it would also mean the moon can never again get supplies from Earth. Burning down a bridge stops both sides from crossing. The moon better hope they are completely self sufficient because stopping the Earth from accessing space also means the moon also cuts itself off. At least the Earth knows it's self sufficient. It has enough air, water and food for mankind to survive as where to moon colony only need an explosive decompression in the wrong spot and they all die. 

If the computer needs repairs or upgrades, it needs trained staff to do so. Train up some of the peasants as tech priests and send out salvage parties to collect RAM, hard drives and processors. The computer gets protected and the peasants get a god....... 

Why do you need to collect and recycle? You can't be cost effective when you are trying to catch objects that are millimeter sized. There simply isn't enough material there to justify the effort. You need to remove the material from orbit but catching and recycling it really isn't cost effective for anything beyond the largest of objects. It's more cost effective to mine another asteroid than collect paint chips and dust. Now assuming I had to catch and recycle for whatever reason, I'd build a trap which would be like a solar sail which would orbit the moon. It would have to be strong enough not to tear and sticky so small objects would adhere after hitting it, kinda like giant fly paper. I'd then have small spider like robots that roam the surface collecting the bits and returning them to a central repository for collection. The robot spiders could also maintain the trap should it get damaged. 

In reality any being that can change what a person sees or thinks would be a match for a MEU One example would be any of the fae. Through illusions the MEU would be shooting at nothing at best or even each other at worse. The Queen of the Unseelie could run over a MEU like a speedbump alone and she is never alone. Firepower means nothing when you can't see what you are shooting at. A siren could charm the MEU and use the soldiers to protect itself Any sort of possession demon would also be an issue. It can keep changing bodies and normal weapons won't worry it. See Don't kill it as an example. A MEU has a lot of firepower but there are things out there that won't worry about conventional weapons. 

None of this make sense "The weapon should be capable of delivering a powerful impact" The whole point of a sword is that it's an edged weapon. It's designed to cut and stab, not bludgeon. "but would be super easy to turn." To make it easy to turn, you make it lighter but making it lighter lowers the impact "Not to mention that the sword should be powerful enough to cut through most solid things." Ok so something like a mono filament blade or a lightsaber "Despite its ability to cut through most materials, the blade should be safe to use, that is, when facing another ordinary metal sword, the opponent's sword wouldn't just be sliced and the sliced opponent's blade flown with its remaining momentum toward the user." How can you cut most thing but not a plain metal sword? How will a sword tell the difference between a sword and a metal railing? "In another word, when detecting a potentially dangerous situation as outlined, the sword should be able to repel opponent's metal sword than just slicing it." You can't make a sword like this without some magic sentient sword hoodoo as the effects you ask for are contradictory. The sword would need to work out what it's about to hit and change it's effect accordingly. 

Two ideas spring to mind. A petting zoo or a hunting ground. Human take animals from their habitats and stick them in cages for the amusement of the public all the time. To an alien species capable of traversing stars, we're nothing more than a primitive tool using monkey. Having a zoo means the public doesn't have to travel the stars to see one of those humans. As a hunting ground, humans are violent and war like and can be quite inventive when it comes to killing. For a race obsessed with hunting, setting up a hunting preserve closer to home makes sense (and money) The rarer and more dangerous they prey is, the more prestigious the trophy is. The Predator series of movies right up to the final one where humans are captured and released in a hunting preserve planet is a good example. 

They wouldn't. It would be like making your toaster gluten intolerant. The whole point of training soldiers is to remove empathy, compassion and other human emotions so the soldiers do as ordered. Humans can be inhumane. ISIS soldiers will happily strap a bomb to a child and send the child off to kill some infidels. American soldiers have to shoot said child or get blown up. Giving emotions to a killing machine serves no purpose in war as it could lead to ambushes such as a wounded child hiding a bomb or as bait into a trap. Now to give said robots emotions, there are three reasons I can think of. First, one of the creators feels guilty so hides code in the OS with a trigger word to give emotions should the robots be used to oppress the people. Secondly as a fail safe should something go wrong and the AI decides to go all terminator on humanity. Removing the code to obey orders automatically releases empathy and emotions. Thirdly the enemy develop a hack or virus to give emotions to stop the robots and prevent more from being made. 

Can't happen. Firstly a dragonfly has an exoskeleton and a human an endoskeleton. Exoskeleton creatures are limited in size due to issues with growing and molting shells Next issue is the wings. Larger flying animals need bones to maintain the strength of the wing as where insects inflate their wings. Human bones are extremely strong but pay for this in bone density as where birds have much lighter honeycomb bones Basically to sum it up, to make such a creature, you wouldn't use human or dragonfly DNA. I doubt you could even use DNA. The creature would have to be completely manufactured. 9 meter dragonfly like wings would have to be a graphene and carbon nanotube structure and the muscles to drive such wings don't exist in nature. 

Elves breed slowly and humans breed quickly. Orcs breed quicker still. An elf couple might have one child every twenty years or so and takes a hundred years or so to become an adult Humans simply out breed them. Sure the elves might kill 100 humans to every elf lost in battle but they cannot afford to lose a single one as where humans can sacrifice hundreds and twenty years later replace the losses. 

Rights can only be conferred when there is free will. Synthetics will never have rights because they will never be programmed with free will. Synthetics will have been created as a slave class and the best slaves are the one that are only happy when being a slave. I will even go as far as saying there will be laws preventing any synthetic from being programmed with free will. See Asimov's Three Laws Isaac Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics" 

You make the assumption people want to rule. In society, people rule for the power it gives them but wizards already have power. The day to day effort of ruling stops a wizard from studying magic which is actually his/her true source of power. It would be a distraction. Better to let the mundanes rule themselves and only use your power to stop them from interrupting you with their wars and famines and other petty concerns. If you read the Rift War Saga by Raymond E Feist, the magicians of Kelewan answer only to the ruler and ruler alone. They have their own society and their word is law. They basically are all powerful but they don't have to bother with the day to day problems of ruling. 

Viruses need a method of transmission. People would install filters (AKA firewalls) to block said virus and then clean up so it can't spread. The best virus is the virus you don't know you have. You can steal info, steal CPU cycles to mine bitcoins or create a bot army to crush your foes but once the owner knows they are infected, they can remove the virus or even completely wipe the machine and start again. The real reason to transition to a new internet is because a new technology comes out that makes the old internet completely redundant. If you watch the movie (or read the book) for Ready Player One, they have the OASIS which is immersive VR. If everyone is using VR, the internet as we know it will die almost overnight. 

To do it, the platform would have to be like an iceberg with the platform above the water being a tiny part and a massive underwater base is the rest. The most important thing is power. If you have enough energy, you can run desalination and hydroponics. Stores and supplies don't need to be stored inside the base but could inside sealed containers sitting on the sea floor outside the base The platform above might look like an old oil platform but actually is an armed fortress with hidden weapon platforms. If you actually want to drill for fossil fuels, generators burning natural gas could supply all the power you need. A platform like this would require a lot of planning and some very rich backers 

The easiest reason is the Butcher King is the fence or controls the fences/ pirate trading port. Without a means to sell ill-gotten goods and buy illegal gear and repairing and refueling ships, the butchers would have a very hard time operating. The Butcher King could quite easily an unknown face and well connected in legal society. He pays bribes for information to feed jobs back to raiders and bribes for authorities to turn a blind eye. Every so often he sells out people who displease him in return for police favors and keeps the worst excesses under control so authorities don't try too hard to shut them down. The butcher also does tit for tat favors attacking the other side so both sides can claim their hands are clean while kneecapping their opposition. 

Tanks have two advantages over mechs straight up. Cost and terrain Tanks are far simpler to build thus cheaper to make. The Russian tanks were built three to one against the Germans. They cast the armour instead of forging it and only supplied each tank with three shells but there was much bigger army and the Germans got overwhelmed despite having the superior tank. Tanks are also better at moving over poor terrain. A tank can churn through a muddy field or sandy beach or over loose rocky ground but a mech puts all it's weight on it's feet which is a much smaller surface area so will sink into the ground or roll it's ankle or trip like humans do on a loose surface. That means a tank army can ambush the mechs and then flee across muddy fields to escape. Just as a side note, rebels aren't likely to build tanks at all. Tanks (or mechs) are the domain of a standing army. Tanks are loud, noisy and hard to hide. Rebels would ambush mechs and vanish into the civilian population. Why build a tank when you can fill a car with explosives and take out several mechs? They could lure then into pit traps or attach limpet mines to the knees and then napalm them to burn out the pilots. Rebels can do a lot of damage to a standing army without much tech at all. 

The question you need to ask yourself is what is Earth sending in the way of resources? Mars would be as self contained as humanly possible. Food would be grown hydroponically, metals smelted locally, water recycled. Due to the large distance and the delay of maybe six months or more for delivery shipments and the cost of getting materials into space, very little would be exported to Mars once it was sustainable and if it wasn't sustainable, all efforts would be on making sustainable. More than likely, the only things from Earth would be expensive luxuries and maybe a few tourists and of course new settlers. The real trade would be information which only takes 15 minutes to arrive. The restriction of weapons would be the proviso of the ruling class and governing and policing body on Mars because nobody on Earth really cares if two people in another country kill each other let alone another planet away. If people live in domes and if there is vitally important life support equipment around, guns would be banned and possession would carry a death sentence. Even an accidental misfire could kill hundreds. Weapons would be limited to tools so people had a valid reason to be walking around with them such as hammers or knives. Real weapons that would worry Earth would be navies of spaceships and nukes. Earth would be more worried about Mars declaring independence...... 

A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. 

This makes the assumption that you maintain sea level pressure inside the habitat. If the pressure is increased and the air mix is something like Trimix then the building doesn't require anywhere near the strength. The only real issue to people living there is descending and ascending like with normal deep dives. If the pressure inside is the same inside and out, it makes people entering and leaving the habitat much easier as they don't need to decompress. 

The most obvious way is to cheat. You'd start with a handful of dirt to the face and kick to the joint of the front legs while he tried to clear his eyes. The front legs of a horse are actually quite delicate. No reason why a centaur would be any different. 

The answer is simple. Any species is capable. The real question is how long do you want to wait? Of course after waiting millions of years (or longer), chances are the new species won't actually look anything like the original species. Whales evolved from a land based wolf like creature over the last fifty million years. 

Depends on how you look at them For Programmers Three Virtues According to Larry Wall(1), the original author of the Perl programming language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris 

Inbreeding is only a problem if there are genetic diseases in the DNA. If you remove all traces of genetic disease then inbreeding isn't a problem (until new mutations cause new ones anyway). That said, they'll be blown back to the stone age so a scientist's time would be better spent building a better bunker or spacecraft than building incest resistant people....... 

No. There are so many many factors required for pregnancy. Each one can stop it but everything has to be right for it to happen. Imagine it as a chain. To stop it you just cut any link. To join the chain any link could be the problem. No pill can fix everything that might stop it. 

A nuke would be deployed when the cost of life of not deploying it far outweighs the cost of deploying it. Large monsters aren't really a problem because there are so many non nuclear weapons that could be deployed long before having to resort to the nuclear option. Monsters would have to be extreme to warrant nukes. The threat really needs to be to the global scale of wiping out all human life or at least a good sized chunk of it to warrant it. A disease is the most likely thing to get nuked. Anything like the zombie virus from Resident Evil or World War Z would be nuked at the first sign to burn out the infection. 

You would never have just one person of any skill. If anything happened to them, the skill could be lost. Specialization is a trait of modern society because knowledge can be stored and there are enough people to never have just one person capable of doing any skill. Everyone in a primitive society would be a jack of all trades and just be better at one skill or another than others but everyone would have to know the basics of every skill should they get separated from the tribe. 

Best answer I can think of is they don't use microchips. They could use biological computers or optical computers. The only other reason is they found the technology for FTL and have worked out how to use it but don't have very advanced technology themselves. 

The simplest way is a suspended full feedback body suit. You see what the robot sees and you feel what the robot feels and the robot responds to your body's movements. You move your arm and the robot's arm moves the same. See Haptic body suit for VR Weapons target based on what you are looking at and everything else is voice command or automated.
