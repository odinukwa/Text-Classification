As "Vikings," the Normans were good SHIP builders. Once they reached land, it wasn't much of a stretch for them to transfer their skills to building churches and other buildings. The Normans adopted a style of architecture that is known as "Romanesque." It was originated by the Romans, but later imitated by many west Europeans, chief among them the Normans. This style made use of rounded arches and was milder than the "Gothic" style, with pointed arches. As to why the Normans were such good imitators, The Normans were described by others (in modern terms) as hungry, ambitious people. $URL$ Hence, they showed a greater desire to learn (and imitate) than their European peers. It appears to have been part of the restless "personality" that caused them to leave Scandinavia in search of more hospitable climates. Once they found them, they became "more royalist than the king," that is more "European" than the other western Europeans. 

In 1938, during the Munich (Czech) Crisis, then British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain expressed his distaste for making war preparations over "a quarrel in a faraway land between people of which we know nothing." That remark seems strange for just before the dawn of the jet age, during an era when Britain had a global empire, because the distance between London and Prague was a little over 600 miles. For comparison, the distances between London and capitals of former colonies were 3000 miles for Ottawa, 3600 miles for Washington, and 10,000 miles for Canberra. Perhaps a more plausible explanation was the reference to "foreign" German and Czech people. But that doesn't seem to make sense, given that the British Royal Family was largely of German origin, including Queen Victoria's Prince Albert, and Mary of Teck, wife of King George V. Perhaps I'm taking the phrase out of context, but in the 19th century, the Know Nothings were a group of anti "foreign" (immigrant) Americans, who professed to "know nothing" about their positions. Otherwise, why would Chamberlain refer to Germans and Czechs as "far away" peoples of whom his contemporaries would know nothing? Did most of them actually feel that way, or was that sentiment more or less particular to Chamberlain? Put another way, was he addressing a large British contingent with a quasi-American "know nothing" mentality (Lady Astor comes to mind.) Apparently, David Lloyd George opined that "Mr Chamberlain views everything through the wrong end of a municipal drain-pipe." 

The core of the Triple Alliance was Germany and Austria-Hungary who promised to protect each other against attack by any third party. Italy was an "adjunct" member, who promised and was promised protection against attack only by France. But since Germany attacked France first, Italy used that as an excuse to "opt out" of the alliance. The Achilles heel of the alliance was that Italy and Austria-Hungary basically hated each other, perhaps even more than either hated France. Each feared "retaliation" by the other; Italy in Venice, Austria-Hungary in Tyrol. Italy "got around" to joining the Allies in 1915 when they promised her Tyrol and Trieste as spoils of war. (Ironically, Germany and Austria-Hungary even offered her South Tyrol to rejoin them.) 

Originally, many knights were robbers. That is to say in the "bad old days" known as the Dark Ages. This was a period when Europe was basically in chaos, central authority was distant or non-existent, the population was declining and losing wealth. In such a vacuum, power rested in the hands of LOCAL authorities. The invention of the stirrup gave the newly-stabilized armored knights mounted on horses a huge advantage over anyone that didn't have these advantages. Therefore, small bands of such knights roamed the countryside under a handful of leaders and robbed and terrorized the "locals" into submission. What curbed this tendency was the rise of chivalry in the late Middle Ages (1300-1500). $URL$ This was a code of honor (or "ethics") that applied to knights. Specifically, they were supposed to fight only "equals" (other knights) and protect people weaker than themselves; especially women and children, and even unarmed men, particularly if "old." Also, they were supposed to submit to the authority of the king, which is to say that they were not supposed to kill or plunder unless ordered to do so. The development of the code of chivalry was incubated by the rise of European populations and the restoration of central authority between 1000-1300. It received a further boost with the resulting development of art, philosophy, and science between 1300-1500 that ultimately led to the Renaissance, Put another way, "knighthood" now became a "profession" instead of a "vocation" because of these developments. Although chivalry was developed in Germany, it gained earlier acceptance in the warmer, milder climate of France, where there was a strong central authority after the end of the 100 Years' War (1453) and to a lesser extent, in Western Germany along the Rhine. By 1500, it was established in these, more western, parts of Europe, but NOT in the colder, harsher climes of eastern Europe including Poland, Silesia, and East Germany (as of 1945-1991) where "central authority," economic development, and population growth was still quite weak. That's why you will hear stories of "robber knights" in these areas in 1540, and not in the more western, civilized parts of Europe, where this phenomenon had disappeared over the previous 500 years. 

Most medieval kings had a court system spread throughout their lands. They maintained "High" Courts for issues of national importance. For courts to decide "local" matters, they maintained local magistrates. In the case of England, these included sheriffs in cities, and justices of the peace, who were country squires. Other European countries had similar structures. In many cities, there were guild courts maintained by trade guilds, who decided cases of economic crimes. 

Here is a chart of global literacy rates. Russia is toward the "bottom" (of developed countries), but still had a literacy rate of about 50% in 1900, rising sharply in the early 20th centuries. This put it above overall world levels. In 1900, "Poland" was (mostly) part of "Russia," but was one of the most developed parts of the country, so its literacy rate would have been higher than Russia's. 

Quezon's best argument for Philippine independence was his highly successful record, first as U.S. Commissioner, 1909-1916, then Philippine Senator (including Senate President), 1916-34, and finally Philippine Presidency (under U.S. oversight) from 1935 onward. After he and his peers did such a good job, no one could deny that the Philippines were ready for self government. 

After the German invasion of Belgium, Britain, then France, guaranteed military support to the country. They delivered on that military support by lining up units at the French border, crossing that border, and linking up with retreating Belgian defending units at Mons (British) and Charleroi (French). This occurred after the Germans had overrun most of the rest of the country. Unlike World War II, there was no co-ordinated plan of defense prepared previously, so the Allied forces just improvised, and helped each other as much as they could to limit the German penetration. Between them, the Allies managed to keep only a small slice of Belgium out of German hands.
