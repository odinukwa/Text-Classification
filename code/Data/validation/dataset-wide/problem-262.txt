Pallas is around 550 km across, again much larger than either Death Star. If a Death Star was in the asteroid belt, we could theoretically have missed it. Further out, you have even more room to play. This is the best picture the Hubble space telescope could capture of Pluto: 

The majority of human societies throughout history have openly kept slaves, and generally have not had any kind of rules about what a person could or could not do with their slaves. Slaves could be raped, beaten, killed, or sacrificed without any problem. Most likely, then, laws would be perfectly happy with dark magic, as long as you only drew from the mana of your slaves - and that means that almost any human society would allow the use of black magic. In addition, given the benefits of this form of magic, one could see those who make the most of it becoming rulers and defining everyone else as 'slaves'. If they do not rule, they will likely instead focus on maximising their slave possessions, and on keeping one another in check. 

In such matters, it's always helpful to scale things down to the familiar. So, imagine for a moment that you are a 2-dimensional being. You can move freely left or right, back or forward, but you have no conception at all of up or down. Then suppose that your house exists on a sheet of paper. I, a three-dimensional being, can take that piece of paper and fold it several times. Each time its size halves, while at the same time having exactly the same surface area inside the folds. By the time I've folded it several times, I can place it easily inside a small square in your 2-dimensional world. As long as I line up the entrances carefully, you can pass through a gap in the square and walk back and forth across the surface of the sheet of paper. Because it's folded through a dimension you have no access to, your perception is that the paper is bigger on the inside. 

You'd need your society to be implausibly stable, while at the same time allowing great flexibility in social roles. Lasting evolutionary change generally takes around a million years. Let's say for the sake of argument that with the rate of mutation artificially accelerated, we'd need 100,000 years to complete the process. What does that mean? It means that for around twenty times longer than the entirety of recorded history, your society has to: 

Consider building a Weald The Weald is a region in the south-east of England, situated between two ridges of chalk hills, the North and South Downs. The geology of the whole region is dominated by these hills, and the lower hills that run parallel to them as you move towards the core. This is analogous to the multiple rings of concentric islands in your map. The region formed originally as an anticline, a place where the crust was folded and lifted, forming a single large ridge or dome. The upper layers then eroded away, leaving the deeper core exposed, with harder rocks resisting the weathering better and leaving behind hills. For your purposes, of a very large, circular or near-circular formation, you would probably want the rock to be uplifted by a magma intrusion, rather than being folded. Magma rose beneath the rocks, perhaps as a result of a mantle plume, hot spot, or similar, but rather than reaching the surface as a volcano, it found a planar weakness in the crust, and spread out, forming a sheet intrusion. Essentially, it was easier to spread out and lift the crust above the magma than to break through the crust to the surface. The entire region was thus uplifted, forming a geological dome. Erosion wears most of that dome away, leaving behind the harder igneous and metamorphic rocks, which form your islands. 

Just because you're able to communicate with an animal does not mean that the animal is intelligent or aware. Even if you found that the animal was intelligent and aware, you could not be sure that it wasn't the spell that made it so. So the answer is going to depend on some details. Is the animal intelligent when you speak to it? For example, if I ensorcell a mouse, does the mouse continue to sniff around the table going "Cheese? Smell cheese. No cheese. Look for cheese. Danger? No danger. Sniff. Cheese?", or does it stop, look at me, and say "Oh, I say, that was most impolite. Don't you know you're supposed to get permission before you cast a spell on a chap?" Does casting the spell change the animal? After I've lifted the spell, does the animal's behaviour return to normal - still sniffing for cheese, still freezing at any sign of danger - or does it sit down and start reading my mail? If the former, you can probably say that it's just the spell that makes them behave as if they're intelligent. The latter, it changes them to make them intelligent. The answer applies to more than just experimentation You've asked in the context of animal testing, but the thing is that if you decide that animals can refuse to be experimented on, why can't they refuse to be eaten? To be harnessed to carts? To have their skins worn? Most likely you're going to need to find a stable middle ground. It is unethical to even use the talk to animals spell unless necessary, and it is unethical to mistreat an animal after casting the spell on them (just in case). If the spell does change them permanently, ethics would dictate that one must provide a comfortable existence for them after the spell has been cast. 

Regular consumer-grade cameras will be able to capture and store a much wider range of colours than just the visible spectrum, and software will be available to easily redshift or blueshift your pictures, going from a picture of the local wifi at the red end, through a heat map, through visible light, on up through ultraviolet, to an x-ray picture at the blue end. Obviously the upper ranges would be much dimmer, due to higher wavelengths being absorbed by the atmosphere, and the lower ranges would have lower resolution, but software interpolation will be able to provide a reasonably clear view at all wavelengths. There will also be much more use of software image processing. Simple picture manipulations like removing background people or creating action shots will be simple and automated. 

The virus spreads quickly, and is both mosquito and human borne (explains why people are worried about "purity" when it comes to breeding"). Cities, or anywhere with a lot of people, are dangerous places, where, depending on your timeframe, either lots of infected people live, or have been devastated as food ran out and people resorted to cannibalism. You have a strong, global organization that could have prepared or seized areas to keep its people safe (perhaps with the only surviving medical facilities capable of detecting or combating the infection). The safest places to live are those where the mosquito's can't survive (extremely cold or hot areas, or extremely dry areas). They are genetically modified, so this is up to you. Hell, make them like killer bees, and have them able to mate with other kinds of mosquitos and pass on the virus and the modifications. 

Give an obviously fake reason that your main character realizes isn't feasible, and then have it really be due to something fun, like a colony revolting, or an outbreak of Space Black Death. Or, more mundanely, you didn't fill out form AE-37 on your Global Exit application, and need to be questioned about it, but you did fill out BC-12, which authorized you to enter the space station. The Global Exit authorities aren't allowed on the space station due to a Union Contract, and nobody can legally question you about the form. They also cannot let you board a spacecraft or return to the surface. Alternatively, someone's name on the manifest matches a name on the Pan-Galactic No-Fly list, and the shuttle is not authorized to dock until it is all sorted out. Add Bureaucracy and simmer on Low until resolved. 

Your issue isn't that you need to understand how the brain works, you just need a brain you have available to work on a different platform. This is a problem of Emulation, not of Creation. Brain in a Jar Not literally, but you are essentially creating a virtual brain in a jar. You don't need to understand how it works, you just need to recreate it within your virtual realm. You then "hook it up" to inputs from virtualized sensory organs (heck, these can even be "parts in a jar" that are also emulated). Maybe over time you can understand how the brain works, and be able to make one "from scratch" but right now, you can just recreate it identically. Cargo Cults I'm going to mention this, just because it's one of my favorite real world oddities. Throughout history, there have been indigenous peoples who worship things brought to their homelands by more advanced foreigners. During WW2, some of these people witnessed first-hand the most technologically advanced war fought between the US and Japan in front of their very eyes. They saw men like them create landing strips, and "gods" bestow upon them gifts of "cargo" from above. When the soldiers left, these natives then built their own landing strips, and hoped for "cargo" to come from the gods. To the point they built mock control towers and even mock aircraft. These natives, obviously, do not understand how the whole process works, but they created things that could be recognized as parts of a working airfield. You could, theoretically, even land a (robustly built) plane at these airfields. This is effectively what you will be doing with these brains. You recognize the forms that need to be created (from brain scans/uploads) but do not understand how to create it all from scratch (the inner knowledge of why it works). 

There are some issues with this, but let's handwave the deadliness part for now (we'll get there). The first issues you need to deal with is spread: If knowledge of the joke can only be gained by reading or hearing it, then everyone who hears or reads it will die from the lethal joke. In theory, it cannot be written down in the first place, because the writer would need full knowledge of the joke, and thus die before finishing writing the joke. This, naturally, assumes everyone is equally vulnerable to the joke. Let's assume now that some percentage of the population is immune to the joke. Perhaps they don't have some underlying condition, or they just don't have a sense of humor. Now, we do have a mechanism for which the joke could be distributed throughout the world. By these people intentionally telling the joke (there's some issues here in that if the person did not find the joke funny, or realized it would kill people, they would not necessarily spread the joke). Your joke is basically a virulent disease. If it is too virulent, then people will die before spreading it, but if it isn't virulent enough, you don't get your desired effect (a deadly joke). It's possible the joke is a "thinker" and takes some time to be funny enough to be deadly. Perhaps enough that you will, after being "infected," tell it to others, before it kills you. It is also possible to have people "immune" to the joke, who will never get it, but may continue to spread it throughout the world. In terms of plausibility, I'm going to go with no, for many reasons. First, it takes some severe underlying conditions to die from laughter. It's possible something in the joke is so obsessing you forget to eat or drink, but the body really tries hard to live, and overriding these urges takes a lot. The most promising route (and easiest to hand-wave) is that the joke sets up some kind of dissonance in the subconscious, and when the person sleeps, they literally scare themselves to death by some nightmare. You could, in theory, also have a logic trap that locks up the brain, but you'd have to get beyond the brain's natural Paradox Absorbing Crumple Zones. 

I have a world where there are two groups of people on an island: The Colonists and the Cave People. In true colonial fashion, the Colonists have frequently fought the Cave People, and there's some disparity in technology. I'm very interested in Cargo Cults and what differentiates a culture's beliefs that something strange and new is a simple expansion on existing technology and that it is magic. The Colonists Technology level is Medieval after the initial introduction of gunpowder. Gunpowder weapons are rare in the Colonial homeland, and few, if any, are present on the island. They have previously had some gunpowder weapons on the island during one of the Cave People uprisings, but it is a rare event. The center of their culture is a religious cult devoted to moon worship. Their clergy are often seen performing various rituals that have no true effect on the world. The Colonists have a moderate belief in this religion, but only the clergy are true devotees to it and believe it all. The Colonists are superstitious, with a variety of good luck charms and ways of warding off "evil." This is more common among their soldiers, who face life and death more regularly than the common people. On the island, the Colonists are largely farmers, with few heavy industries or mining. Most of what they need manufactured is imported from their homeland. They have access to Steel in abundance, and most of their tools and weapons are made of steel where appropriate. They see the Cave People as pagans that need to be converted to the true religion or killed. The Cave People The cave people are a lower technology group. They can forge basic metals, but the effort required is often too much to warrant their use in weapons. Typically metal is used in jewelry or for religious purposes. The common weapons they use are blades made of obsidian (which is plentiful) and armor and shields made of animal hide (the type and thickness of the hide is a symbol of rank). Their religion is shamanistic, and tied heavily to the land. They worship the Sun as the divine spark for their life and believe their spirits ascend to join the sun in the afterlife (to the point that they believe if they go outside during the day their spirit will rush from their body to join the sun). This religion incorporates ancestor worship as well. Their culture is heavily tied into verbal folklore and stories. In order to be considered an adult, a variety of trials must be undertaken, including the perfect recitation of the clan's history. They take pride in their ancestors, and the honorific X son of Y son of Z of Clan W is a common way of greeting a visitor. Their society is broken up into a dozen or so clans, and only in rare occasions do they cooperate (often warring among each other, making things easy for the Colonists to establish their foothold). When they act together, they are a fierce opponent, having nearly removed the Colonist foothold twice in four wars. It usually takes one charismatic individual to unite the clans into one body (there have been four such leaders since the Colonists have come). They are just as intelligent as the Colonists, but less technologically advanced. They have, in the past, used captured weapons against the Colonists (often afterwards they are enshrined as relics of some hero or the other's conquests). They believe in rituals and magic to make their weapons and shields strong, and have oracles who consult the flames for advice and augeries. They see the Colonists as evil worshipers of the vile moon, which is a pale imitation of their holy sun. The Conflict The two sides have been in conflict for eighty years. The Colonists have cornered the Cave People twice, and the Cave People have nearly wiped out the Colonist's presence twice. At the moment they are at a standoff, with each side controlling roughly half of the island (though more and more Colonist farmers are pushing into Cave People territory). There is no formal treaty or diplomatic relationship between them. One of the wars that almost ended in the Cave People's favor was halted by their leader (who was unbeaten in combat) being killed by a bullet wound. What sort of things would the Cave People see as the Colonists performing magic? I've isolated that any gunpowder weapons would likely be seen that way, but I'm stuck at what else they would consider magic and try to counter with their own magic or try to replicate (like a cargo cult).
