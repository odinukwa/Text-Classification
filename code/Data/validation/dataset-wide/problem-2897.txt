I note logic's nature to be contradictory. How there's no meaning in everything, so overall logic isn't considered more fundamental to the universe, but in the same arguement I rely on logic for everything and can"t seem to answer why it's important to me.

Say if you are feeling anxious you feel "butterflies" in your stomach, or when despairing empty/ or heavy around your heart. If two people each reach the same degree of these emotions do they expirience the same feelings? And if not, what influences them? 

While nihilism played a major role Nietzsche’s existential philosophies I don’t believe he accepted the idea that a transcendental ego exists, and with this acknowledgement comes a certain tether to life that understands our incapability and thus embraces the “irrational” side of human action and endeavor. Camus absurdism is an existential belief that interrogating the world will never create a response, whether concerning the nature of being or order, it is absurd to question existence, as, to our inherent ability, we won’t find an answer. This extended along with the quote by Cioran, Camus argues that if life lacks personal virtues, what makes it less meaningful than death? As before, suicide is believing that death is better than life and how we observe the nature of death to be uneventful, this suggests despair in the individual’s life beyond their existential view. But such ideas may be overwhelming, it’s not easy to accept an un-conformed chaos into your life, yet in the end the individual’s life focuses around their most prominent ideas, religion, which in this case would be destroyed, is a path to further one’s position, like heaven, while furthering the individual’s spiritual content due to their adherence to theology. Our life is to satisfy ourselves, the idea alone doesn’t make life not worth living, we live as long as we have find that equal, or greater than death. In most cases joy is enough to sustain the individual, for some death is out of immediate reach and thus more troublesome to die, than to live. 

Unlikely to be a philosophical school. This question is for an empirical science as psychology to solve not to philosophy. But it has implications for the "philosophy of happiness", as we shall see. Regarding happiness, what philosophers can observe before the empirical science is what is dictated by the common sense that happiness isn't pleasure. Pursuit of happiness is not to seek pleasure. Pleasure is satiable but not happiness. If, for whatever reason, one does equate happiness with pleasure, then the paradox of hedonism arises. 

Why Karl Popper wanted to say that the criteria of falsifiability is better than induction? Popper wanted to say that induction is not justifiable. That a theory has been corroborated in the past "says nothing whatever about future performance." Popper wanted to say that it is possible to avoid assuming that the future will, or probably will, be like the past, and this is why he has claimed to have solved the problem of induction. We do not have to make the assumption, he tells us, if we proceed by formulating conjectures and attempting to falsify them. He says that, as a basis for action, we should prefer "the best-tested theory." This can only mean the theory that has survived refutation in the past; but why, since Popper says that past corroboration has nothing to do with future performance, is it rational to prefer this? Without the inductive assumption, the fact that a theory was refuted yesterday is quite irrelevant to its truth-status today. So demising the inductive assumption makes nonsense of Popper's own theory of the growth of scientific knowledge. The more often a conjecture passes efforts to falsify it, Popper maintained, the greater becomes its "corroboration", although corroboration is also uncertain and can never be quantified by degree of probability. "Corroboration" is a form of induction, and Popper has simply sneaked induction in through a back door by giving it a new name. Every falsification of a conjecture is simultaneously a confirmation of an opposite conjecture, and every conforming instance of a conjecture is a falsification of an opposite conjecture. If Popper bet on a certain horse to win a race, and the horse won, you would not expect him to shout, "Great! My horse failed to lose!" Astronomers look for signs of water on Mars. They do not think they are making efforts to falsify the conjecture that Mars never had water. For Popper, what Carnap called a "degree of confirmation", a logical relation between a conjecture and all relevant evidence, is a useless concept. Instead, the more tests for falsification a theory passes, the more it gains in "corroboration”. It's not so much that Popper disagreed with inductivists as that he restated their views in a bizarre and cumbersome terminology. Why scratch your left ear with your right hand? 

If the universe encompasses all of causality does it contain all knowledge within in, and furthermore exist in all aspects of it? Or is there a paradox that limits its ability or a contradiction you can impose? 

"Only optimists commit suicide, optimists who no longer succeed at being optimists, the rest with no reason to live, why would they have any to die?" (Emil Cioran) Nihilism doesn't always deprive the individual of virtues. Many personal truths survive the existential acknowledgement of nihilists, while your perception of life changes, all the aspects that you have experienced in it are personal and relative. It is the individual's perception that determines whether they sustain beyond this. I like this quote by Cioran as I believe it clears up the misconception that suicide is directly caused by lack of virtue, suicide occurs when the individual believes death is a better position than life. It may be fueled by the deprivation of understood truth, but in the end it's whether you believe you would be able to continue life happily. A few books for research... 

This is a conundrum in ethics theory. This is a particular issue of a more general moral problem. For Kant and others, moral judgement ought not unfairly to depend on factors not under the agent’s control. Reflection on our actual judgements, however, reveals their widespread determination by various kind of luck. Luck affects morality in four ways. The first is ‘constitutive luck’, luck in the kind of person one is, which depends, at least partially, on factors beyond one’s control such as heredity and environment. The second is ‘circumstantial luck’, luck in the kind of problems and situations one faces. For example, some young Germans who were morally lucky to have left Germany in the early 1930s. Had they stayed, they would have been faced with a terrible moral test which many of them would probably have failed. Thus, according to Nagel, whether or not a person became a Nazi murderer was, to a significant extent, a matter of circumstantial luck. The other two ways luck is believed to influence morality have to do with the causes and effects of actions. If determinism is true, then our very choices are beyond our control, and thus a matter of good or bad luck. The other and last kind of luck, sometimes referred to as ‘resultant luck’, is luck in the outcome of one’s actions and projects. This includes cases of decisions made with uncertainty, as when a political leader decides to go to war knowing full well at the time of the decision that if the venture fails, the decision can never be justified retroactively; and cases as the driver who neglects to check his brakes and is guilty, if no harm ensues, of mere negligence. But if through bad luck the driver kills a child in his path, he is judged and judges himself more harshly, even though his input is the same. The independence of these different kinds of luck from one another makes life difficult for critics of moral luck. To sustain the alleged immunity of morality to luck, they have to show that each and all of them have no effect of morality. The estimation of moral worth, and notions such as responsibility, justification, and blame, are indeed subject to luck, and hence morality is also threatened by luck. Since every aspect of our moral life results from factors which are beyond our control, there seems to be nothing left for us to be responsible for and the area of genuine agency. We constantly morally evaluate people for things which are not under their control. There aren't principles of choice which would guarantee that if we follow them, we will have no reason to reproach ourselves later, whatever happens. All physical events are caused and determined by the sum total of all previous events. Given an initial set of conditions external and internal to the mind, only one “choice” or behavior will result. Thus, given any set of actual initial conditions in this world, any person’s “choice” could not have been otherwise. In terms of daily “choices,” most people appear to already accept deterministic principles. We assume that certain events or choices will result in causally determined consequences. Multiple effects or choices to potentially emerge from a single cause or set of causes seem to violate the relationships we observe with all other causal sequences in the universe. It does not seem very plausible that the deterministic, causal relationships that existed in the universe for billions of years would suddenly suspend themselves to accommodate the relatively recent development of the brain’s nerve clusters. How can non determined choices potentially emerge from a single cause or set of causes provide people with any control over their behaviors? The orthodox view is that those who act immorally are to blame for their actions because they were free to choose otherwise. Since they are to blame, we are then entitled to punish them in proportion to their crime. But is a kid brought up in the ghetto really free to choose? Isn't he just a victim of his environment? Naturalists see no need to accept the way problems were structured by the folk wisdom of our ancestors, a natural explanation of the notion of blame and desert doesn't hinge on how we explain free will. Presumably the principle on which our social contract works is that legal or social punishments are determined according to some prior notion of moral responsibility. Presumably, people hang on to this idea because they believe that taking a more realistic attitude to the attribution of blame and desert will lead to the collapse of our moral institutions. Determinism don't say that the level of punishment we administer to defaulters is never determined by the extent they were in control of the events leading up their crimes. On the contrary, such cases are clearly the norm, because an efficient social contract won't call for penalties to be inflicted when the circumstances under which the crime was committed are such that inflicting the penalty won't deter similar deeds. But there are plenty of exceptions, as with the continuing execution of mentally ill criminals in Texas. The paranoid schizophrenic executed someday subscribed to the same folk wisdom as his executioners: “I knew it was a mistake. I have no one to blame but myself.” If it can be demonstrated that Abel's death at the hand of Cain was accidental by pointing to the immediate cause of the crime, we don't need to follow the practice of our predecessors by holding Cain to blame. But when the causal chain is uncertain, our social contract needs to be ruthless. All of us, for example, are held to be guilty until proved innocent when it comes to paying tax. The extent of the damage suffered by a victim is often largely outside the criminal's control. For example, a mugger may hit two victims equally hard, but he will only be tried for murder if one of them happens to have an unusually thin skull. Nearer to home, how many of us have escaped imprisonment and ruin as a consequence of negligent driving only because we happen not to have hurt anybody? Therefore the doctrine that the seriousness of a crime is determined by the consequences to the victim also fits the same pattern: when the causal chain is uncertain, our social contract needs to be ruthless. Our prisons are already full of youngsters from deprived backgrounds whom everyone agrees “never had a chance”. A social contract that doesn't discourage antisocial behavior won't survive, and so deviants have to be punished for the same reason that we quarantine those suffering from dangerous diseases. Quarantine is to be found in the social mechanism traditionally used to control the outbreak of a dangerously infectious disease like scarlet fever. We recognize that being quarantined is unpleasant, but we don't ask whether people got infected by accident or through negligence before temporarily imprisoning them. We isolate them, because the alternative is that the disease will spread, and we don't want healthy people to catch it. 

Intro I've been working on a paper on success and I've put a line that I feel very strongly about, "Sometimes when we fail to accomplish our desires for the day they manifest into thoughts during the night. Furthermore , they continually antagonize virtue, since doubt had no other direction to point to." Background This is an idea that came to me after I moved. I used to have a decent schedule, go to the gym, hangout with friends, and at night I would fall asleep quickly. Now I've noticed me missing a few important opportunities and I've found myself imagining them being accomplished, as well as further achievements. Question Though the paper is expected to be biased, and personal, the overall feel is very weak and hardly argued. Are there any philosophies concerning the idea that we tend to visualize success more when we are unsatisfied with life? 

You have five people, and properties A, B and C. Your people respectively have properties AB, AB, BC, BC, AC. P(B|A) = 2/3 P(B|C) = 2/3 P(B|A,C) = 0 

If the story wasn't clear enough, I am saying that NA is right to treat this scenario asymmetrically. One's tools of rationality are designed precisely so that you are able to talk about areas of uncertainty. These are not a mere matter of convention, they are facts about the way the world works, and the further you stray from them the more wrong you will be. 

Roxanne, an atheist, is grappling with the lack of intrinsic meaning to life. How can one hold objective beliefs about value without an objective source? Enter stage left, God. God: Roxanne, worry no more, for I am here to grant your request. I shall declare to you that which is unambiguous moral good. Roxanne: Bless you, Lord, my woes are no more! God: First, welfare is a virtue and suffering a sin. Second, consequentialist utilitarianism is correct. I declare these facts to be objective truths. Roxanne: Thank you profoundly! There is so much wasted time to make up for, so many lives I had neglected to save! Though if I may beg one more request... why is it so? God: Because I declared it so. Roxanne: Yes, only... why specifically that? Why not deontology, or to ask us to throw teapots around the sun in ironic tribute? God: I doubt you would be enthralled by that prospect. Roxanne: Even if it was true? God: I declare it to be true. short pause Roxanne: You're right, I'm not feeling it. God: As I tend to be. 

The challenge is to explain what is meant by a "inalienable natural right". Suppose we try to define inalienable natural rights for example in terms a God's revelation, or in terms of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. Then the fact that it will nevertheless make perfect sense to describe a something inalienable natural right but against or outside a God's will or the Declaration, will immediately show that the definition of inalienable natural right in terms of a God's revelation or The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has failed. Several major, predominantly Muslim countries criticized the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provisions for democratic principles, protection for religious freedom, freedom of association and freedom of the press, as well as equality in rights and equal protection under the law. Rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are to be subject to the Islamic sharia. On Asian values of Asian states perspective, the Bangkok Declaration of 1993 offers an extended critique of human rights universalism. They view the principles of sovereignty and noninterference, calling for greater emphasis on economic, social, and cultural rights, particularly the right to economic development, as inalienable natural rights too, over civil and political rights. War Resisters International has stated that the right to conscientious objection to military service, and the right to refuse to kill, are inalienable natural rights too. God’s counsel to parents: whenever children get out of line, we should beat them with a rod (Proverbs 13:24, 20:30, and 23:13-14). If they are shameless enough to talk back to us, we should kill them (Leviticus 20:9, Deuteronomy 21:18-21, Mark 7:9-13, and Matthew 15:4-7). The Bible even tells us we are free to sell our daughters into slavery (Exodus 21:26-27). If a man discovers on his wedding night that his bride is not a virgin, he must stone her to death on her father’s doorstep (Deuteronomy 22:13-21). Over time we read the Bible selectively and often metaphorically. But that is just the point: we must be consulting our standards of morality that do not come from God in order to judge which aspects of God's word to take literally and which aspects to ignore. Before we worship a God or Jesus we must judge him good, so our inalienable natural rights are not derived and are independent from a God or Jesus. A derivation from descriptive statements with “is” to prescriptive statements with “ought” is impossible. Without an objective, "inalienable natural goal", a "inalienable natural right" is difficult to establish. Without an objective "self-evident" truth is possible to think the opposite without a contradiction. Persuading someone would necessarily mean appealing to values he already possesses.

It is not just that empiricism works, and in 300 years has brought us from semaphore lines to global high speed interconnects, or that non-empiricism is a fervent breeding ground for falsehoods and mysticism; those are true and more than justify aversion to the magical, but they don't explain why that should be the case. Rather, it is that in the modern day we come further and further to irrefutable evidence that people are empirical. I will not go into detail on the evidence, but it suffices to say that if you agree to this much you also understand that there is nothing that you can do, even in theory, that a machine cannot. There is no mental magic that lets you probe beyond the veil. There is no mystical wand to wave that lets your knowledge constitute more than a map to the territory. Even if there was such a contortion of reason it would be nothing that could not in principle be done by another appropriate arrangement of gears and lasers. There is no higher level of knowledge than empirical knowledge because that is all that can be known. No matter how smart you are, Solomonoff induction is smarter. No matter how wise you are, your mind can only be causally related to causal objects. A devotion to a "higher level of truth" leads to epistemic voids like zombies or the ontological argument, arguments that seem appealing on the outset but do nought but waste time. In contrast empirical work is why we can now talk about the consciousness of brains under fully homomorphic encryption, or the measurement problem, real problems that represent huge leaps in the boundaries of philosophical discussion. Even when talking about the mind, or issues like free will, actual progress is made through empirical study. If you want to say that empirical arguments do not stand at the same height as the rest of philosophy, I would not disagree, but it is certainly not because it is lower. Until brute philosophy can make a single step forward in its own field the way Copernicus, or Turing, or Darwin, or Everett, did upon it, I hardly see much competition. 

Someone might argue that if there is no empirical evidence to appeal to in order to establish whether brains in a computer model of the world that can simulate human conscience, then the hypothesis is metaphysical. Many philosophers would maintain that such metaphysical possibilities do not amount to pragmatic cases of doubt: At present, it is physically impossible to make a computer model of the world that can simulate human cognition and replicate the qualitative phenomenology of a human conscience. The hard problem of consciousness is why or how does some particular brain process produce that particular taste or visual sensation? It is difficult to see any real explanatory connection between specific conscious states and brain states in a way that explains just how or why the former are identical with the latter. There is therefore an explanatory gap between the physical and mental. This difficulty in explaining consciousness is unique; that is, we do not have similar worries about other scientific identities, such as that “water is H2O” or that “heat is mean molecular kinetic energy.” There is an important sense in which we can’t really understand how physicalism could be true. The existence of a "hard problem" is controversial and has been disputed by some philosophers. For philosophers who assert that consciousness is nonphysical in nature, there remains a question about what outside of physical theory is required to explain consciousness. Consciousness is especially resistant to explanation in physical terms because of the inherent differences between our subjective and objective modes of understanding. But why we must be deluded by schizophrenic and LSD hallucinations to empathetically take on an experiential perspective understanding? Is subjective understanding necessary to make objective science? Some physicists, argue that an interpretation is nothing more than a formal equivalence between sets of rules for operating on experimental data, thereby implying that the whole exercise of interpretation is unnecessary, for example in quantum physics. Any modern physic's scientific theory requires at the very least an instrumentalist description that relates the mathematical formalism to experimental practice and prediction.
