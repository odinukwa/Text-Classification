For ordinary poor people (ie, people who pay under $1m a year in tax), the law does nothing. They are not affected in any way. For rich people (those who pay more then $1m a year in tax), the saving is incredible, stupendous. 

Note that you would almost certainly have to make it that only biological children count, and that it has to be fully proven with technology who the biological parents are. (This would harken back to, imagine say the days of the French court, when the birth of a child was a big legal occasion, it had to be absolutely witnessed that the baby came from the correct mother, and no subterfuge, trickery etc was involved.) 

(Of course, watch out for gravity - but you can handwave that, particularly as we already have terraforming, psychic power, and FTL. It's precisely the sort of thing that would make the planet special.) 

This is so spectacularly, epically, unrealistic, that you would have to go immediately to sub- sub- sub- atomic particles. Not atom engineering (!), not proton engineering (!!!!), not quark engineering (!!!!!!!!!!), you would have to hypothetize a culture which... ...engages in engineering, actually in the domain of string theory. wiki article So, in some handwaving sense, their engineers would be able to manipulate the fundamentals of the "things" that make up quarks Repeat: they would be able to manipulate the things which make up quarks (... which make up protons, which make up atoms, which make up everyday matter). "!" In some handwaving sense, they could create pure "string concepts" which would form in to "matter-like" sheets. The sheets would be - wow - not merely "an atom thick" but a trillionth of an atom thick. The sheets would (of course!) be the odd few hundred million square light years in size, as you say, perhaps shaped in to a big ball. It would all be as strong as the forces that hold together protons... (aside ..... holy shit!) ...and could easily bend, stretch, or do anything you want. (Since, notably, the superstrings, uh, define the nature of dimensional reality. So, you will have no trouble say "stretching them".) String theory has a handwavey thing about "resonances" (it's a funny observation that your story, would not be much more more handwavey than .. string "theory" itself :-) ) which you could surely play with in the plot. TBC it is "utterly inconceivable" that any normal nanomaterial as you ask about could be millions of lightyears across and a few atoms thick. Forget nanoengineering (which is "merely" messing about with whole atoms and molecules). You can read up on quark matter which goes one better than nanoengineering. But as I say, even some sort of "quark engineering" ("!!") is just totally out of scale for what you need. Your only hope is a culture that can literally engineer at the string theory level. Hell! 

This one is so obvious, unfortunately it's in a number of scifi books already! (But the tails are usually added by simple genetic work. If you propose naturally-evolving tails, it would simply take, say, 100 million years, like any evolution.) 

Consider all the amazing modern history, say last 400 yrs, of Africa. All the ins and out, different "eras", colonialism, etc etc... On this planet we really only have three or four "major stories," like that. Consider, if Earth was a "large surface area" planet, with merely twice the radius, the overall human story would be just really astoundingly large and complex. There would be perhaps 15, 20, massive "major areas" each with substantially massively different cultures and stories. Let me explain how I came to this thought: On this Earth as we know it, I've been everywhere! :) There are maybe 10 good bars and I've gotten smashed at all of them. I was thinking ... imagine if we had half a dozen Earth-like planets all close in our system and travel was possible. That would be fantastic! Instead of just "Asian culture", "African culture", "The Americas", and "European culture" - with these half-dozen planets, there would be 10, 20, 30 such massive major regions. Instead of the 5 or so major world megacities we know, there would be 30 or 40!! All of that is great, but then I realized, if you simply had a planet that was merely twice the radius, that is such an incredibly large surface area that indeed it would be just as good as having a half dozen Earths! As a typical evil villain megalomaniac, given some advanced alien technology i can sort of imagine "conquering all of Earth" as we know it.... But if Earth had 10, 15 massive major regions - rather than just the 3 or 4 we have currently - it would be a whole other thing. And many, many more good bars. 

One throwaway simple answer that would work in a book: The other day I was thinking, imagine if our Earth was just a bit bigger - say, twice the size (twice the radius). It occurred to me: the surface area would be massively, spectacularly, stunningly bigger - imagine an Earth with four times the surface area. our present Earth has the three or four land regions - North America, Sth America, Africa, Eurasia. Bearing in mind too that the poles are a bit wasted, an Earth merely twice the radius would have perhaps 20 or even more such "massive socio-political-historic regions". 

BTW note that even more-so, if you have "inertia control" (just as in Star Trek and most scifi ships) - then, the design of moment of inertia is all-important. Indeed: just one example, you could have a ship that deliberately is long and slender with huge weights concentrated on each end... Then by using your "inertia dampers" on just one end you could create astoundingly fast (sci-fi) combat movements - spins, "dodges", and so on. 

If you're talking about "natural" evolution, We has tails for awhile there for (in short) mucking about in trees. the really obvious future need is 

If you want to exclude space travel. The simple answer is "if for some reason we again had to spend a lot of time in trees." Say you asked "what would make humans evolve gills?" The obvious and only answer would be "if for some reason we again had to spend a lot of time in water." The purpose of tails (on primates) is mucking about in trees. (The purpose of tails on incredibly fast quadrupeds - cheetahs. etc - is an extremely sophisticated balance system, allowing for high speed running. But we're primates. Primate tails == trees.)
