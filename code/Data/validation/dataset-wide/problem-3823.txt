There are many alternative compactifications of $M_{g,n}$ which live naturally under the classical Deligne-Mumford compactification $\overline{M}_{g,n}$. For instace the moduli spaces of weighted curves $\overline{M}_{g,A[n]}$ where $A=(a_{1},...,a_{n})$ is a vector of rational weights $0<a_{i}\leq 1$. These spaces were introduced in $URL$ Starting with weights $A = (1,...,1)$ by lowering them to $A=(a_{1},...,a_{n})$ we get a reduction morphism $$\rho:\overline{M}_{g,n}\rightarrow\overline{M}_{g,A[n]}.$$ The morphism $\rho$ is birational and in general it contracts some boundary divisors. Other moduli space, like moduli of Prym $\overline{R}_{g,n}^{r}$ and of Spin curves $\overline{S}_{g,n}^{r}$, admit natural forgetful morphisms over $\overline{M}_{g,n}$ which are finite and not birational. Are there moduli spaces (perhaps moduli of curves with some addictional structure) admitting modular birational morphisms to $\overline{M}_{g,n}$ ? In some sense a version of moduli of weighted curves birationally living above $\overline{M}_{g,n}$. 

Let $\overline{M}_{g,n}$ be the moduli space of $n$-pointed genus $g$ Deligne-Mumford stable curves. This is a normal projective scheme. Then $$codim_{\overline{M}_{g,n}}Sing(\overline{M}_{g,n})\geq 2.$$ For instance for $g = 1, n = 2$ wa have that $\overline{M}_{1,2}$ is a rational surface with four singular points. Does there exist any value of $g$ and $n$ for which $Sing(\overline{M}_{g,n})$ is in codimension at least $3$ ? 

For other manifestations of these phenomena you may look at stacks of weighted pointed curves, prym, spin, and level curves ($URL$ Remark: Note that a singular stack could have a smooth coarse moduli space. For instance, take $X = L\cup R\subset\mathbb{A}^2$ be the union of two lines. We have an action of $S_2$ on $X$ switching $L$ and $R$. Now, the quotient stack is singular because it admits an Ã©tale cover by something singular. However, the coarse moduli space is $\mathbb{A}^1$. 

Sections of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(n)$ are homogeneous degree $n$ polynomials in $x_0,x_1$. You can consider the two sections $x_0^n,x_1^n,$ and construct the morphism $$g:\mathbb{P}^1\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^2,\:[x_0,x_1]\mapsto ([x_0,x_1][0,x_0^n,x_1^n])$$. You have also the morphism $$e:\mathbb{P}^1\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^2,\:[x_0,x_1]\mapsto ([x_0,x_1][1,0,0])$$ Note that the images of these two morphism are disjoint. The image of $e$ is going to be the unique curve with self-intersection $-n$. Let $[y_0,y_1,y_2]$ be the homogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^2$. The fiber of $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}\oplus\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(n))$ over the point $[x_0,x_1]\in\mathbb{P}^{1}$ is exactly the line $$F_{x_0,x_1} = \left\langle [x_0^n,x_1^n,0],[0,0,1]\right\rangle = \{x_1^ny_1-x_0^ny_2 = 0\}.$$ Then $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}\oplus\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(n))$ is the surface $\mathbb{F}_n$ in $\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^2$ defined by $x_1^ny_1-x_0^ny_2 = 0$. Another method: let $E= e(\mathbb{P}^1)$ and $F$ a fiber. Then $E+F$ represents the sections of type $$p:\mathbb{P}^1\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^2,\:[x_0,x_1]\mapsto ([x_0,x_1][p_n(x_0,x_1),x_0^n,x_1^n])$$ where $p_n(x_0,x_1)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$. The curve $E$ is given by $y_1 = y_2 = 0$ in $\mathbb{F}_n$, therefore $E^{2} = -n$. The linear system $|E+nF|$ has degree zero on $E$, one on $F$ and $n$ on $E+F$. This means that it maps $\mathcal{F}_n$ to a surface $C$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$ whith a unique singular point (corresponding to the contraction of $E$) and whose hyperplane section is a rational normal curve of degree $n$. Then $C$ is a cone over a rational normal curve of degree $n$ and the vertex is a singularity of type $\frac{1}{n}(1,1)$. The surface $\mathbb{F}_n$ is the blow up of the vertex of the cone which is isomorphic to the scroll $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}\oplus\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(n))$. Finally, in a less direct way, one could observe that both $\mathbb{F}_n$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}\oplus\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(n))$ are geometrically ruled surfaces over $\mathbb{P}^1$, and that both contain a unique curve with negative self-intersection $-n$. This is enough to conclude that $\mathbb{F}_n\cong \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}\oplus\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(n))$. 

Here is an explicit way to construct a small modification. Consider the points $p_1,...,p_{n-3}$. We have $n-3$ codimension two linear subspaces $H_{i_1,...,i_{n-4}}^{n-5} = \left\langle p_{i_1},...,p_{i_{n-4}}\right\rangle$. For any choice of $i_1,...,i_{n-4}$ we define $\{j_1,j_2\} = \{0,...,n-3\}\setminus\{i_1-1,...,i_{n-4}-1\}$. Then, the projection from $H_{i_1,...,i_{n-4}}^{n-5}$ is the rational map $$ \begin{array}{lccc} \pi_{i_1,...,i_{n-4}}: & \mathbb{P}^{n-3} & \dashrightarrow & \mathbb{P}^1 \\ & \left[x_0:...:x_{n-3}\right] & \mapsto & [x_{j_1}:x_{j_2}] \end{array} $$ We get a rational map $$ \begin{array}{lccc} g: & \mathbb{P}^{n-3} & \dashrightarrow & (\mathbb{P}^1)^{n-3} \\ & x=\left[x_0:...:x_{n-3}\right] & \mapsto & (\pi_{1,...,n-4}(x),...,\pi_{2,...,n-3}(x)) \end{array} $$ Note that the hyperplane $W = \left\langle p_1,...,p_{n-3}\right\rangle = \{x_{n-3}=0\}$ is mapped by $g$ to the point $q_1=([1:0],...,[1:0])\in (\mathbb{P}^1)^{n-3}$. Furthermore, this is the only divisor contracted by $g$. Therefore, blowing-up $q_1\in (\mathbb{P}^1)^{n-3}$ we get a small transformation $g_1:X_{n-3}^{n-3} = Bl_{p_1,...,p_{n-3}}\mathbb{P}^{n-3}\dashrightarrow Y_1^{n-3} = Bl_{q_1}(\mathbb{P}^1)^{n-3}$ mapping $\widetilde{W}$ (the strict transform of $W$) to the exceptional divisor $E_{q_1}$, while the exceptional divisors $E_{p_1},...,E_{p_{n-3}}$ are mapped to the strict transforms of the $n-3$ divisors in $(\mathbb{P}^1)^{n-3}$ obtained by fixing one the factors. Furthermore, $g([0:...:0:1]) = ([0:1],...,[0:1])$ and $g([1:...:1]) = ([1:1],...,[1:1])$. Let $\mathcal{U}\subset X_{n-3}^{n-3}$ and $\mathcal{V}\subset Y_1^{n-3}$ be the two open subsets on which $g_1$ is an isomorphism. Now, by applying the universal property of the blow-up we get that $g_{1|\mathcal{U}}$ lifts to an isomorphism $f:Bl_{p_{n-2},p_{n-1}}\mathcal{U}\rightarrow Bl_{q_2,q_3}\mathcal{V}$. Since $g_1$ is an isomorphism in codimension one we conclude that $f$ induces a small transformation $f:X = Bl_{p_1,...,p_{n-1}}\mathbb{P}^n\dashrightarrow Y=Bl_{q_1,q_2,q_3}(\mathbb{P}^1)^{n-3}$ mapping $E_{p_{n-2}}$ to $E_{q_2}$, and $E_{p_{n-3}}$ to $E_{q_3}$. 

In characteristic zero you do not neen rational. It is enough rationally connected. Let $X$ be a smooth, projective, rationally connected variety over a field of characteristic zero. Then 

That is true. Basically it is a consequence of the following fact: Let $D$ be a nef and big divisor on an irreducible projective variety $X$. Then there exist an effective divisor $E$ and a rational number $0 <\epsilon\ll 1$ such that $D-\epsilon E$ is ample. Proof: Let $D$ be a nef and big divisor. Since $D$ is big, by \cite[Corollary 2.2.6]{La}, there exist an ample divisor $A$, an effective divisor $E$, and a positive integer $k$ such that $kD\equiv A+E$. If $h>k$ we can write $hD\equiv (h-k)D+A+E$. The divisor $D^{'} = (h-k)D+A$ is a sum of a nef and an ample divisor. Therefore $D^{'}$ is ample. If $\epsilon = \frac{1}{h}$ we get that $$D-\epsilon E\equiv \epsilon D^{'}$$ is ample. Now, it is enough to apply this to $D = -K_X$. What you get in the end is the follwing: Let $X$ be an irreducible, projective variety with at most klt singularities. If $X$ is weak Fano then $X$ is log Fano. 

The following is a consequence of Theorem 1 in "A. Bertram, Moduli of Rank-$2$ Vector Bundles, Theta divisors, and the geometry of curves in projective space, J. Differential Geom. 35, 1992, 429-469." Let $C\subset\mathbb{P}^{2h}$ be a degree $2h$ rational normal curve. Consider the following sequence of blow-ups: 

Let $f:X\dashrightarrow Y$ be a small birational map, where $X,Y$ are normal $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial varieties. Let $\Delta_X\subset X$ be an effective $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor such that the pair $(X,\Delta_X)$ is klt. Let us take the image $\Delta_Y=f(\Delta_X)\subset Y$. Is the pair $(Y,\Delta_Y)$ still klt or not? I am actually interested in the following case. Let $f:\mathbb{P}^n\dashrightarrow\mathbb{P}^n$ be the standard Cremona, and let $p_1,...,p_{n+3}\in \mathbb{P}^n$ be general points. We take $p_1,...,p_{n+1}$ as the center of the Cremona. Let $X$ be the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^n$ at $p_1,...,p_{n+3}$. Then $f$ induces a small birational map $\overline{f}:X\dashrightarrow X$. If $(X,\Delta)$ is a klt pair then is $(X,\overline{f}(\Delta))$ a klt pair as well ? 

If $S$ is a smooth, projective, rational surface and $-K_S$ is big, then $S$ is a Mori Dream Space. I will prove the following: if $k\leq 8$ then $X_k$ is a Mori Dream Space. The anticanonical of $X_k$ is $$-K_{X_k} = 3H-E_1-...-E_k.$$ Therefore $-mK_{X_k} = 3mH-mE_1-...-mE_k$. Therefore the anticanonical correspondes to the linear system of plane curves of degree $3m$ with points of multiplicity $m$ at $p_1,...,p_k$. Now, $h^0(\mathbb{P}^2,\mathcal{O}(3m)) = \binom{3m+2}{2}$. Furthermore a point of multiplicity $m$ imposes $\binom{m+1}{2}$ conditions. Considering the difference $\binom{3m+2}{2}-k\binom{m+1}{2}$ we get: $$\lim_{m \to +\infty}\frac{h^0(X_k,-mK_{X_k})}{m^2} = \lim_{m \to +\infty}\frac{(9-k)m^2+(9-k)m+2}{2m^2} = \frac{9-k}{2}.$$ Finally $9-k>0$ if and only if $k<9$. If $k = 9$ then $-K_{X_9}$ is nef but $K_{X_9}^2 = 0$. Then $-K_{X_9}$ is not big. 

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a smooth morphism between smooth schemes. Then there is an exact sequence $$0\mapsto T_{X/Y}\rightarrow T_{X}\rightarrow f^{*}T_{Y}\mapsto 0$$ Now let us assume $f$ to be a birational morphism with smooth fibers, meaning that the exceptional locus of $f$ is the disjoint union of smooth divisors. In this setting does the above exact sequence still exist? 

Now, let $\psi:\overline{M}_{0,6}\rightarrow (\mathbb{P}^1)^3$. You can take your sequence of blow-ups and blow-downs as $f = \phi^{-1}\circ \psi$. 

An example in dimension $3$ where $-K_X$ is not ample. Take $X$ the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^3$ at six general points $p_1,...,p_6$. The anticanonical divisor is $$-K_X = 4H-2E_1-...-2E_6 = 2(2H-E_1-...-E_6).$$ Therefore for any strict transform $\widetilde{L}_{i,j}$ line $L_{i,j} = \left\langle p_i,p_j\right\rangle$ we have $-K_X\cdot\widetilde{L}_{i,j} = 0$. Furthermore, if $\widetilde{C}$ is the strict transform of the twisted cubic $C$ through $p_1,...,p_6$ we have $-K_X\cdot\widetilde{C} = 0$ as well. Therefore $-K_X$ is not ample. However, since the base locus of $|-K_X|$ is zero dimensional $-K_X$ is nef. On the other hand if we take $p_1,...,p_k$ general points, with $2\leq k\leq 4$ then the $\widetilde{L}_{i,j}$ still have intersection zero with $-K_X$. However, $X$ is toric and in particular log Fano. This means that there exists a reduced simple normal crossing divisor $D$ on $X$ such that $-(K_X+D)$ is ample and $(X,D)$ is klt. 

The scroll $S_{(1,k)}$ can be locally parametrized by the map $$ \begin{array}{cccc} \phi: & \mathbb{A}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1 & \longrightarrow & \mathbb{P}^{k+2}\\ & (u,[\alpha_0:\alpha_1]) & \mapsto & [\alpha_0 u:\alpha_0:\alpha_1 u^k:\alpha_1 u^{k-1}:\dots:\alpha_1 u:\alpha_1]. \end{array} $$ Now, consider the Segre embedding $$ \begin{array}{cccc} \sigma: & \mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^k & \longrightarrow & \mathbb{P}^{2k+1}\\ & ([u:v],[\alpha_0:\dots:\alpha_k]) & \mapsto & [\alpha_0u:\dots:\alpha_ku:\alpha_0v:\dots :\alpha_kv]. \end{array} $$ and let $\Sigma_{(1,k)}$ be its image. Note that $\Sigma_{(1,k)}$ is locally parametrized by $$ \begin{array}{cccc} \widetilde{\sigma}: & \mathbb{A}^1\times\mathbb{P}^k & \longrightarrow & \mathbb{P}^{2k+1}\\ & ([u:1],[\alpha_0:\dots:\alpha_k]) & \mapsto & [\alpha_0u:\dots:\alpha_ku:\alpha_0:\dots :\alpha_k]. \end{array} $$ and that $\deg(\Sigma_{(1,k)}) = \deg(S_{(1,k)}) = k+1$. Now, take $\alpha_{i} = \alpha_1u^{i-1}$ for $i=2,\dots,k$. Then $$\widetilde{\sigma}(u,[\alpha_0:\alpha_1:\alpha_1u:\dots :\alpha_1u^{k-1}]) = [\alpha_0u:\alpha_1u:\alpha_1u^2:\dots:\alpha_1u^{k-1}:\alpha_1u^k:\alpha_0:\alpha_1:\alpha_1u:\dots\alpha_1u^{k-1}]$$ and the coordinates functions of this last map are exactly the ones appearing in the above expression of $\phi$. Therefore, if $[Z_0:\dots:Z_{2k+1}]$ are the homogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^{2k+1}$ and $$H^{k+2} = \{Z_j-Z_{k+j+2}=0,\: j = 1,\dots,k-1\}\cong\mathbb{P}^{k+2}$$ then we have $$S_{(1,k)} = \Sigma_{(1,k)}\cap H^{k+2}\subset\mathbb{P}^{2k+1}$$ 

Let $p_1,...,p_8\in\mathbb{P}^{3}$ be points in linear general position. Then there exists a unique elliptic curve $C$ of degree $4$ passing through $p_1,...,p_8$. I am interested in what happens for nodal rational curves of degree $4$. Now, let us suppose we have seven points $p_1,...,p_7\in\mathbb{P}^{3}$ in linear general position. How many irreducible, rational curves of degree $4$ pass through $p_2,...,p_7$ and have a singular point of multiplicity $2$ at $p_1$ ? Such a curve can be constructed as a complete intersection of two quadric surfaces which are tangent at $p_1$, or as a projection of a rational normal quartic curve $C$ in $\mathbb{P}^{4}$ from a point lying on a secant line or an a tangent line of $C$. 

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a finite morphism. If $\mathcal{L}$ is an ample line bundle on $Y$ then $f^{*}\mathcal{L}$ is ample on $X$. Let $V\subseteq X$ be a subvariety. By the projection formula we have $f^{*}\mathcal{L}^{dim(V)}\cdot V = \mathcal{L}^{dim(V)}\cdot f_{*}V$. Furthermore $\mathcal{L}^{dim(V)}\cdot f_{*}V>0$ because $\mathcal{L}$ is ample, and $f$ finite implies $dim(f_{*}V) = dim(V)$. Finally $(f^*\mathcal{L})^{dim(X)} = deg(f)\mathcal{L}^{dim(Y)} >0$. By Nakai-Moishezon $f^{*}\mathcal{L}$ is ample. In your case via the Segre embedding $s:\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^3$ the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(1,1)$ corresponds to the line bundle $\mathcal{O}_{Q}(1)$ on the quadric $Q = s(\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1)$. Since linear sections of a quadric are plane conics and two such linear sections intersects in two points (namely two linear sections give a line and the two points are the points of intersection between the line and $Q$) we get $deg(\mathcal{O}(1,1)) = 2$. Now your $f:X\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ is of degree $2$. So $deg(f^{*}\mathcal{O}(1,1)) = 2\cdot deg(\mathcal{O}(1,1)) = 4$. 

You can see the question in this other way. Take an automorphism $\phi:Q\rightarrow Q$ and compose it with one of the two projections $\pi_i\circ \phi$. Then $$\pi_i\circ\phi:Q\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^1$$ is a fibration with connected fibers. Therefore $\pi_i\circ\phi$ necessarily factorizes through $\pi_{j_{i}}$ with $j_i\in\{1,2\}$. Associating to $\phi$ the permutation $\{i\mapsto j_i\}$ we get a surjactive morphism of groups $$f:Aut(Q)\rightarrow S_2.$$ On the other hand if $\pi_i\circ\phi$ factorized through $\pi_i$ this means than $\phi$ comes from an automorphism in $Aut(\mathbb{P}^1)\times Aut(\mathbb{P}^1)$. Therefore we have an exact sequence $$0\mapsto Aut(\mathbb{P}^1)\times Aut(\mathbb{P}^1)\rightarrow Aut(Q)\rightarrow S_2\mapsto 0.$$ Now, it is enough to obeserve that $f$ admits a sections to conclude that $Aut(Q)\cong (Aut(\mathbb{P}^1)\times Aut(\mathbb{P}^1))\rtimes S_2$. 

Just to give you an idea of the computations which are involved here is the simpler example of a quadric cone. Let us consider the action: $$ \begin{array}{ccc} \mu_{2}\times\mathbb{A}^{2} & \longrightarrow & \mathbb{A}^{2}\\ (\epsilon,x_{1}, x_{2}) & \longmapsto & (\epsilon x_{1},\epsilon x_{2}) \end{array} $$ The ring of invariants is given by: $$k[x_0^2,x_0x_1,x_1^2]\cong k[y_0,y_1,y_2]/(y_0y_2-y_1^2)$$ and we see that the singularity $X=\mathbb{A}^{2}/\mu_{2}$ corresponds to the vertex $v$ of the affine cone $$X=Spec(k[x_0^2,x_0x_1,x_1^2]\cong k[y_0,y_1,y_2]/(y_0y_2-y_1^2))$$ that is the vertex of a quadric cone $Q\subset\mathbb{P}^2$ or equivalently the singularity $\frac{1}{2}(1,1)$ of the weighted projective plane $\mathbb{P}(1,1,2)$. Now, $dx_0\wedge dx_1$ is a basis of $\bigwedge^2\Omega_{\mathbb{A}^2}$, and $(dx_0\wedge dx_1)^{\otimes 2}$ is invariant under the action. The form $$\omega = \frac{(dy_0\wedge dy_1)^{\otimes 2}}{y_0^2}\in \left(\bigwedge^2\Omega_{k(X)}\right)^{\otimes 2}$$ is a basis of $(\bigwedge^2\Omega_{X})^{\otimes 2}$ because the quotient map $\pi:\mathbb{A}^2\rightarrow X$ is \'etale on $X\setminus\{v\}$, and $\pi^{*}\omega = 4(dx_0\wedge dx_1)^{\otimes 2}$.\ Blowing-up the vertex $v$ we get a resolution $f:Y\rightarrow X$. If $[\lambda_0:\lambda_1:\lambda_2]$ are homogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^2$ then the equations of $Y$ in $\mathbb{A}^3\times\mathbb{P}^2$ are: $$ \left\lbrace\begin{array}{l} y_0\lambda_1-y_1\lambda_0=0, \\ y_0\lambda_2-y_2\lambda_0=0, \\ y_1\lambda_2-y_2\lambda_1=0, \\ y_0y_2-y_1^2. \end{array}\right. $$ Therefore, $y_1 = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_0}y_0$, and $\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}=\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_0}$ yields $y_2 = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_0}y_1 = (\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_0})^2y_0$. Then, in $Y$ we have an affine chart isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^2$ with coordinates $(y_0,t)$ where the resolution is given by $(y_0,t)\mapsto (y_0,y_0t,y_0t^2)$, with $t = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_0}$, and the exceptional divisor $E$ over $v$ is given by $\{y_0=0\}$. We have $$f^{*}\omega = (dy_0\wedge dt)^{\otimes 2}.$$ Therefore, $f^{*}\omega$ has neither a pole nor a zero along $E$, and we may write $K_Y = f^{*}K_X$.
