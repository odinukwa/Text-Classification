See the other answers for reasons you can create, but to elaborate on @DaniellYancey's comment, the logistical concerns are: - Distance Imagine my coworker is leaving, but I need to clarify one thing before they go. To start a telepathic conversation I have to first catch the person. That's less convenient then shouting at them to stop and then catching up to them. Imagine leaving a restaurant. Frequently the staff will thank you for coming, but that won't work telepathically. Meetings where the participants don't fit nicely in a 5 ft circle wouldn't do well with telepathy—at least as the primary form of communication. And some other conversation situations: the lazy coworker shouting at you from down/across the aisle; bump into a friend at the grocery store and shop together; a teacher instructing her students. - Delivery This may be less of an issue, but if someone is focused on their work and shielding from all pings, how effective would a telepathic "Fire!" be. Or a gunman in a store. 

Notes: a) Depending on how aristocratic your future society is, it might make sense for tight-knit (or not-so-much) families to come together in a single home. b) The wealthy might opt to build their home on a less crowded planet, or build a high-class community on an artificial (and mobile?) island. 

It has become accepted knowledge that the planet Earth was birthed via a swirling cloud of dust and gravel clumping into larger and larger pieces of rock. It began 4.54 billion years ago, and 100 million years later, the newly molten Earth was 8,000 miles wide and 25,000 miles around. But in this alternate universe, Earth was birthed five billion years ago, as the gravitational pull of the newly birthed sun lured in wandering dwarf planets from neighboring star systems. The result is that dozens if not hundreds of dwarf planets (varying in size from that of Ceres, 945 kilometers wide, to that of Ganymede, 5268 kilometers wide) crashed and merged together to form newer, larger bodies before becoming planets. Their surface and core compositions would vary from rock to metal to ice. This alternate Earth was formed from such collisions before Theia arrived to make an even bigger crash. Back home, it took Earth 100 million years to reach its modern size, and that was from asteroidal clumping. In regards to the speed in which to reach full size, would it make any difference if Earth was instead formed from the colliding and re-merging of wandering dwarf planets captured by the gravitational strength of the sun? 

In both punks, the landscapes provide a real larger-than-life scope that some fantasy or sci-fi writers may find necessary. But my question is this: Historically speaking, what point of departure do I need to make either punk a reality? 

If they already have to speak verbally in so many situations, then it might become the default mode of communication. However, I suspect it would still be used to clarify assumptions/understanding or establish facts. Consider the impact on testing, teaching, and legal systems. E.g. testing an apprentice's understanding of your craft; teaching what front-line warfare is like; "Is my kindergartner lying to me?", ask for the memory. 

Most people have referenced personal taste or societal trends or fashion, and indeed this is a sufficient reason. I'll focus on two other reasons: Status A futuristic world could have a growing population living on a relatively fixed amount of land. In such a case, land is a commodity, and having a large amount of personal property would be a visual indicator of wealth. Now it defeats the purpose if the house doesn't match, so why not make it extra large? Add a handful of guest rooms, a ballroom, an oversized library and/or study, and you've got yourself a manor or a mansion. 

Organic The quantum-powered hero gets headaches when perilous situations are coming up because he died in some other possibility and it collapses back through time to a point of low peril. Some possibilities collapse clearly; others don't. Naturally, boss fights are especially dangerous futures, so it's natural for collapses to happen right before such fights—it's a relatively—and for you to subsequently collapse back to this point. Unknown The small shrines to the ancient god of death aren't recognizable by most these days, and it might be the god has a shrine guardian preventing people from noticing. Regardless, you're in his employ, so you can pray at these shrines and the god of death will remember your prayer. Then you go assassinate someone as part of your beliefs. If you fail, well, the god of death isn't done with you; he'll reject your death and return you to the last shrine you prayed at. Perhaps a shrine is constructed there for your convenience since the god of death gave you this dangerous assignment and suspected you'd need it. It could also, be a natural feature the enemy camp incorporated into their layout. Maybe it serves as a common household decoration, and the unwitting decorators for your next target have helped you out. Immovable Due to the nature of the Ancient's engineering, there's no practical way to move the their restoration chambers. If only someone had the right genes to make use of them... If no one is known to be able to exploit these inconvenient chambers, then enemies will just build around them. If this spot is the best for the enemy boss, then the "unusable" restoration chamber outside the door doesn't make a difference—it's alien tech that they had to work around. Note: This one doesn't work in the long-run. Anybody finding out that an enemy can just respawn indefinitely in their base will relocate somewhere safer. Secret Some of your robotic compatriots have discretely embedded some reconstruction points in the enemy base. It's doubtful the humans will figure out about the reconstruction points: all robots look the same, so how could they know it's the same robot attacking again and again. Even if they were looking, it'd be hard to find them without a special robotic vision mode/mod. Your compatriots would naturally plant these points in optimal spots for you, and right before the Big Bad Boss is, I would think, very optimal. Note: This one doesn't work well in the long-run unless the antagonists are really dumb and don't pick up on the pattern, but it would probably work longer than the immovable solution. 

Let's say that a patient is in hospital suffering a terminal disease or at least a physical injury that's very expensive to treat. The only hope of salvation is to have artificial, or cybernetic, DNA injected into the injury. The unexpected side effect is that the injection won't stay in the injury itself but rather spread through the body, strengthening the bones and tissues, sharpening the senses and censoring pain. The patient would still look like a normal human, walk like a normal human and even talk like a normal human, but his internal anatomy would be a confused blur between organic and mechanic. This is, of course, a sci-fi scenario, but the question regarding the scenario is this--does it teeter on the Star Trek degree of plausible (believable), or on the Star Wars degree of fantastical? 

So if the Baltic never became a sea, if we still have the ancient Baltic Plain, would it have any major differences to European climate, landscape and culture? 

In the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire, the initial problem with building a new cityscape is weight, a problem solved, at first, by a steel skeleton. In subsequent years, other methods would develop--mass-tuned dampers, curtain walls, pyramidal shapes, concrete cores, etc. But nature has given us something far stronger than steel, and this time, I am not talking spider silk. 

It seems for someone to fit your requirements, they can't instigate what they are famous for. Even if they don't instigate it, you may disqualify them for having an aforementioned trait whether or not that trait (indirectly) caused the thing or was utilized in their response to it. 

Function Shield generators are great, but it's not like they can shield themselves, right? That's you need walls around them to protect them from the direction they don't project the shield. And even if you've got future tech that spits out balls of plasma at enemies, you've still got something that looks like a cannon. It doesn't hurt to elevate those on a tower to get a better angle at footmen while distancing it from the shield generators so they are less likely to become collateral damage. 

I'd like to note that your problem might be stemming more from your approach. It sounds like you might be describing the material world more than you are describing the culture. As a reference, Treasure Planet comes to mind. It's a futuristic world, but has a heavy colonial and piratic feel. 

Frankly, I think notable on any significant scale entails historical impact. Here's some examples along ozone's famous victim path. 

Hard science: No. That said, the best theory I can give you is that humanity has always had the potential ability to manipulate reality—something intrinsic to our intelligence probably. To activate the ability requires the right mindset, and maybe the right genes. The right mood or mindset creates the right brain chemistry to allow the ability to turn on, but then it also takes the right effort or skill to actually apply the ability. You can cite all the scriptural miracles as evidence. If your character isn't a prophet sort of person, then maybe his genes are a new mutation that allow for a wider range in brain chemistry to turn on the ability than the rest of humanity. 

The geographical features that make New York stand out from any other of the United States--Long Island, the huge boulders scattered in the city and the Hudson River, deep enough for barges to pass through without problem--are possible because New York was the furthest south that the ice of the Late Pleistocene extended from the Arctic. 

Back home, the Appalachian Mountains are no wider than 100-300 miles, no longer than 1500 miles and no taller than 6,683 feet above sea level, and the Great Lakes are five separate lakes totaling to an area of 94,250 square miles. 

Where was Russia in all this time? Since the Dark Ages, Russia had undergone a cultural stagnation. It took no part in this post-Plague advance and luxuriousness. It was simply stuck in the Dark Ages. Westernization had to wait until Tsar Peter the Great changed Russian culture and made his empire as European as the rest of Europe. But this still proves that Russia was pretty slow on the history track. But did it have to be the case? Would Russian history be less bloody (Nicholas I, Lenin, Stalin, to take into consideration) if Russia simply tagged along with the rest of Europe and had its Enlightenment in sync with the other nations?
