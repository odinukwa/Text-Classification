I guess you're assuming that we are otherwise able to communicate, learn each other's languages, etc. Otherwise any attempt to establish common units of measurements will get bogged down in basic comprehension. Something like a kilogram would be almost impossible to communicate. The definition of a kilogram is that it is the mass of a certain block of platinum at the national bureau of standards in Paris. If the aliens can't visit Paris to weight it, they're out of luck. You could define mass in terms of the mass of a specific atoms, say Hydrogen. To scale it to something convenient for creatures our size, say the mass of 10^24 atoms of hydrogen or whatever convenient number. For time I'd say to take the half life of some naturally occurring radioactive isotope. Distance could then be the distance that light travels in a specified amount of time -- assuming we've got time worked out from the previous step. Energy could be the amount of energy released by a specific chemical reaction. Or a nuclear reaction, I suppose. Let's see, once you have time, mass, distance, and energy, I think most other units can be derived from those. 

In what sense do you mean the question? Is the question, Is it physically possible, i.e. is there something about the nature of the land making up Bangladesh, or about it's location on the globe, that makes it impossible for them to become a superpower? Or is it, Is it psychologically or culturally impossible, i.e. do the Bengali people just not have the right mind-set to become a superpower? If it's (a), I'd guess the answer is that there is nothing stopping them. Portugal became a superpower in the 1400s, Spain in the 1500s, Britain in the 1700s, etc. None of these countries had any obvious abundance of some crucial natural resource or any such. I don't see why geography or resources would prevent Bangladesh from becoming a superpower. If it's (b), then in one sense I'd say that the same things that keep them relatively poor now would likely continue to keep them relatively poor. What makes countries rich and powerful? Well, historians debate that and have written books on the subject. In the short run, an aggressive and capable ruler can lead his nation to conquer his neighbors and build an empire, even if his home nation is relatively poor. Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan come to mind. To build a rich country requires a nation with many people with an entrepreneurial spirit, a philosophy or religion that embraces science and technology, and a government that allows people to pursue these things. That's pretty much how the Greeks, Dutch, British, and Americans did it. Could Bangladesh adopt such ideas? There's nothing physically stopping them. I think it's up to them. 

It depends on how these enhancements works. Say, for example, that you have an enhancement that increase a person's raw strength. And let's suppose that the average man has a strength of 100 on whatever scale and the average woman is a 60. If it increases strength by 10%, then when you're done men are now at 110 and women are at 66. Both are increased, but men have the same proportional advantage they had before. On the other hand, if the enhancement increases strength to 110 regardless of what the person's original strength was, then men no longer have an advantage. If for whatever reason it increases a man's strength by 10 but doubles a woman's strength, then men are now at 110 and women at 120 and women have the advantage. As others have noted, a fundamental question is why there are not more women soldiers. Partly, no doubt, it is because men are physically stronger and even in this modern high-tech age, combat requires physical strength. But it's also at least partly because women tend to be much more averse to violence: there are more men who want to be soldiers than there are women who want to be soldiers. And women have more reason to fear being captured by the enemy. A captured woman can be raped. If an enemy captured men and forced them to have sex with beautiful women guards, lots of men would think that was a reward, not a punishment. Etc. We could debate whether such differences are genetic or cultural, but it doesn't much matter: they exist. (An argument on the genetic side: you would be hard pressed to find many examples of cultures where the women go to war while the men stay home. Examples outside of fiction, that is. If it was purely a cultural construct, one would expect that a large number of cultures would be the opposite of Western civilization.) 

Resistance to change is only a factor if people start out with a geocentric model. If you posit a heliocentric model coming first, then resistance to change would favor that. In any case, while it is certainly true that there are people who reject new ideas because, "the old way was good enough for my grandfather and it's good enough for me", there are also plenty of people who embrace new ideas out of a love of novelty. Teenagers routinely question their parents' beliefs and chase after new ideas. (The Bible mentions that Paul of Tarus took advantage of how the Greek intellectuals loved to discuss new ideas as a way for him to introduce Christianity. "For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing." -- Acts 17:91) So it's not at all clear that resistance to new ideas would be a major barrier. It's not clear how religion supports the geocentric view. Nothing in the Bible supports a geocentric view, and the Greek and Roman pagans didn't have a clear body of authoritative writings. I haven't studied what the Koran says on the subject. Yes, yes, the Catholic Church opposed Galileo, but that wasn't for any religious reason. The Catholic Church at the time also ran the colleges, and the college professors were committed to the geocentric view because of their faith in Aristotle. The pope found Galileo unconvincing but was willing to let him spread his ideas ... right up until Galileo wrote a book with a character named "Simplico", which means "simpleton", i.e. idiot, who was clearly modeled after the pope. Insulting powerful people in print is not a recipe for success in any society. Also, while we remember Galileo as being right, most of his arguments were flawed. For example, he said that tides were caused by the motion of the Earth: as the Earth moved in its orbit, the oceans tended to lag behind because of inertia, causing tides. Opponents blew holes in that argument. Heliocentric ideas have been around for a long time. I don't know who first proposed a heliocentric theory, or if anyone today can say for sure. Archimedes assumed a heliocentric model in his paper that is now called "The Sand Reckoner", circa 250 BC, which discusses the size of the universe and large numbers. (He assumes that the universe might be as much as 2 light years across.) Others have mentioned Aristarchus of Samos, same era. I think the real problem is this: What experiment can you perform to distinguish a geocentric universe from a heliocentric universe? Of course everyone today knows that the Earth goes around the Sun and that those ancient people who thought otherwise were incredibly stupid to think such nonsense. But ask them how they KNOW that the Earth goes around the Sun and not vice versa, and few could give an answer beyond "I read it in a book" or "they said so in that science show on TV". The geocentric model actually worked pretty well for predicting things people could observe: the rising and setting of the Sun, seasons, eclipses, even the observed motions of the planets. What I think really did it in was as telescopes improved and people were able to make better observations of the motions of the planets, the geocentric model had to get more and more complicated to explain them. They had to introduce "epicycles" and all sorts of contorted sub-theories to fit the experimental observation. Ultimately people realized that with a heliocentric model and elliptical orbits, everything worked out quite nicely. Then Occam's Razor, pick the simplest theory that fits the facts, and the heliocentric theory won. As @Aaron notes, people eventually figured out that there in fact IS a measurable parallax in observation of the stars. But it is minuscule: the difference at opposite ends of the Earth's orbit is 1/3600 of a degree for a star 3.26 light years away -- a "parallax second". No one was able to measure that finely until 1838. So all of that said ... I think the way to get a heliocentric theory sooner is for astronomers (or astrologers) to make sufficiently detailed observations of the planets earlier and realize the awkwardness and unlikeliness of epicycles. 

Note you have not one but two assumptions here: (a) that the technology exists to build AI humanoid robots, and (b) that the technology exists to build a 3D facsimile of a human being good enough to fool people who know him. Well, maybe also (c) that you can combine these two things. Clearly (a) without (b) does not create any privacy issues like you're discussing. (b) without (a) creates most of the same issues you describe. If the art of make-up and/or plastic surgery and/or prosthetics advanced to the point where one human being could be made to look enough like another to fool people, you'd have the same issues that you describe. This isn't a totally new problem. People have been impersonating other people since the dawn of recorded history. But presumably a robot built to look exactly like the subject person could at least theoretically be better than any attempt to disguise one person to look like another. All of which is my way of leading up to ... is the premise of the question that we are assuming that this AI robot can successfully impersonate a person so well that even his family and friends can't tell the difference? Or is that part of the question? If we just take it as the premise that it can be done, then sure, what stops someone from creating such a robot and having him go to your home or office and examine all your most secret things, read your personal papers, etc? At that point I think I'd be worried about a lot of things besides privacy. Like what if this robot steals my stuff? Signs contracts or otherwise makes commitments in my name? Commits crimes that I then get arrested for? Starts arguments with my friends who think he is me and now they hate me for life? Makes love to my wife? Or what if the creator kills me and replaces me with this robot? If the assumption is that the robot can indeed fool everyone, then the only defense is to have laws against it and punishments severe enough to deter people from trying it. But of course there would always be criminals who would ignore the law, and some number would get away with it. But I find the premise hard to believe. No matter how good a duplicate these robots are, surely a plot to impersonate or replace someone could be easily foiled by having passwords. If people knew the technology existed, then the fact that someone looks exactly like so-and-so would not be considered definitive. The bank wouldn't hand over money to someone based on recognizing his face, spies wouldn't reveal secrets, your boss wouldn't accept a resignation, your friends would question uncharacteristic behavior, etc. Looking exactly like Fred Smith would prove about as much has having a sticker on your shirt that says "Hello my name is Fred Smith". You'd have to identify yourself in some way that is not easily duplicated. Like a password. Unless the people who make the robots can not only make an exact duplicate of a person's physical appearance but also read his mind to learn his passwords, that would be an excellent defense. Beyond that, how good are the duplicates? For example, are the robots made of flesh and blood, or are they electronic and mechanical? If the latter, then if someone is suspicious he could demand a blood sample or take an x-ray. People could ask the robot things that only the real person would know. Like, "What did you say to me when we spoke last Thursday night?" Again, unless the people who make the robots can read minds, there would be all sorts of things that the real person would know that the robot wouldn't. I think that if someone is suspicious, they could think of any number of ways to tell that this is an impostor robot. If the real person is someone that many people would have a reason to want to impersonate -- if he's a big shot politician or a billionaire or a spy with vital information -- then if people knew this technology existed, presumably they'd make it a routine practice to check. Just like, even without this sort of technology, you don't just walk onto a military base or into a bank vault or even into many business offices. You're expected to have an ID or some sort of proof of your identity that is at least somewhat difficult to forge. The more damage you could do by gaining unauthorized access, the more effort is put into keeping out impostors. Perhaps you could get away with it if you can avoid making people suspicious. Like if someone walked into my office tomorrow who looked exactly like one of my co-workers, what would it take for me to suspect he was an impostor, even if I knew the technology to make look-alike robots existed? If I tried to talk to him about something we had discussed the previous day, could he bluff his way through the conversation? If he just said that he forgot what we had talked about, I'd probably buy that once, but if he "forgot" everything we've said to each other for the past month, I think that would arouse suspicion. If he said he lost the key to the front door, okay, people lose things. But if he lost the key to the front door, and he lost his ID card, and he forgot his password on the computer network, etc, at some point you'd start to get suspicious. Even if we assume that AI's can pass for intelligent human beings -- which is a big assumption, we're nowhere near such technology today and one could fairly question if it's possible -- but even if we assume an AI can pass for an intelligent human in general, could it pass for a PARTICULAR person? Could it duplicate all his mannerisms, his style of speech, know everything he knows and not let slip that it knows things he doesn't know, etc? How would the creator of the robot impostor get all this information? They'd have to follow someone around for weeks or months recording everything he said and did. Could they do that with no one noticing? One could imagine that the technology exists, but is used fairly rarely so that people do not normally consider the possibility. Like, when I go to the bank, they make me show my drivers license before they'll give me money. Does the technology exist to forge a drivers license? Of course. But it's rare enough for people to do it that the bank doesn't worry much about it. If these AI robot impostors existed but it cost a million dollars to build one, no one is going to build one to impersonate me and go to the bank and withdraw the thousand dollars or so I may have there. They might build one to impersonate Bill Gates and go to his bank. The real vulnerability would be people who are worth going to the trouble to build an expensive robot impersonator but who no one really thinks about as being worth the trouble. Someone is a friend of the big-shot general but not really powerful himself, but by impersonating him you can get into the general's office and steal military secrets, that sort of thing. Whew, long answer. Interesting subject, I guess.
