The first situation is an exhaustive disproof of existence, and is (if I understand what you have written) sound in its logic. The second is perhaps reasonable, and (again if I understand your writing) is called inductive reasoning, it is however not logical- not a valid deduction, as was explosively pointed out by Hume in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. As such, in 'the finite case' they are profoundly different, one being logically valid, the other not. When the bag of balls becomes infinitely large, however, the situations become nearly identical in practice, as in finite time one can never check every ball to see that it is not red, and so some inductive reasoning is necessary in both cases. In the latter case, however, they are not entirely the same- for the first situation is still slightly better than the second. In the first situation, we make a hypothesis 'there are no red balls in the bag' that we subsequently test in a way that could falsify it: in the second, since we do not repeat the experiment after we make our hypothesis, our hypothesis is not fallible (this is important for reasons articulated by Karl Popper amongst others). 

My rationale, very roughly, is that if processing is, so to speak, a series of monologues in diverse and disjoint tongues, this would be consistent with (imply?) the qualia hypothesis. For me this is the reason why massive modularity is untenable, as for various reasons I would not touch any qualia-driven theory of the mind with a barge pole. Is my hunch in any way tenable? Has anyone put forward such a contention seriously? 

Wittgenstein once said [and may have later recanted] that the world is everything that is the case, the totality of facts not of things, and that that world is determined by those facts, and they're being all the facts, since the totality of facts determines what is and what is not the case. In conversation, we often use the phrases, "this/that is the fact of the matter," and "this or that is, or is not, the case." In light of Wittgenstein's observations, (or rejecting them), is there such a thing as the fact of the matter, or a case [of the matter]? That is,what is the fact of the matter regarding the "fact of the matter" usage? If there is [a fact of the matter re this ussage], can it be described? 

Whether the proposition is fallacious or sophistic depends upon the utterer's epistemological presuppositions. If a [naive?] realist, then Jobermark's answer will suffice. If, however, the speaker is [for instance] an anti-Kantian/enlightenment-universalist Herderian neo-pragmatist/historicist (a historical forebear of contemporary "post-truth" culture and its fetish with identity politics), your interlocutor is essentially/merely telling you that you lack the cognitive/emotional/historical equipment to occupy the logical space occupied by women, you lack the hardware necessary to run the software, so to speak. (Have a look at Rorty's Feminism and Pragmatism, at p. 202 of his Philosophical Papers, Volume 3, Truth and Progress, which, while not directly on point, expands upon this answer.) I understand @Jobermark's point, both in response to my original entry and in response to Chen’s entry. However, I do not believe he grasps the thrust of my, and possibly Chen’s, argument. I mentioned Rorty's Feminism and Pragmatism, at p. 202 of his Philosophical Papers. What follows is a quotation from the first page of that essay, followed by an entry quoting Dewey, from the same essay at p. 216: “When two women ascended to the Supreme Court of Minnesota, Catherine MacKinnon asked, “Will they use the tools of law as women, for all women?” She continued as follows: I think that the real feminist issue is not whether biological males or biological females hold positions of power, although it is utterly essential that women be there. And I am not saying that viewpoints have genitals. My issue is what our identifications are, what our loyalties are, who our community is, to whom we are accountable. If it seems as if this is not very concrete, I think it is because we have no idea what women as women would have to say. I’m evoking for women a role that we have yet to make, in the name of a voice that, unsilenced,might say something that has never been heard. “ [ McKinnon, Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1987), p. 77]. “Urging judges to “use the tools of law as women, for all women” alarms universalist philosophers. These are the philosophers who think that moral theory should come up with principles which mention no group smaller that “persons” or “human beings” or “rational agents.” Such philosophers would be happier if MacKinnon talked less about accountability to women as women and more about an ideal Minnesota, or an ideal America, one in which all human beings would be treated impartially. Universalists would prefer to think of feminism as Mary Wollstonecraft and Olympe de Gouges did, as a matter of rights which are already recognizable and describable, although not yet granted. This describability, they feel, makes MacKinnon’s hope for a voice saying something never heard before unnecessary, overly dramatic, hyperbolic.” Universalist philosophers assume, with Kant, that all the logical space necessary for moral deliberation is now available — that all important truths about right and wrong can not only be stated, but be made plausible, in language already to hand. I take MacKinnon to be siding with historicists like G. W. F. Hegel and John Dewey, and to be saying that moral progress depends upon expanding this space.” And quoting Dewey: “Women have as yet made little contribution to philosophy, but when women who are not mere students of other persons’ philosophy set out to write it, we cannot conceive that it will be the same in viewpoint or tenor as that composed from the standpoint of the different masculine experience of things. Institutions, customs of life, breed certain systematized predilections and aversions. The wise man reads historic philosophies to detect in them intellectual formulations of men’s habitual purposes and cultivated wants, not to gain insight into the ultimate nature of things or information about the make-up of reality. As far as what is loosely called reality figures in philosophies, we may be sure that it signifies those selected aspects of the world which are chosen because they lend themselves to the support of men’s judgment of the worth-while life, and hence are most highly prized. In philosophy, “reality” is a term of value or choice.” (John Dewey, “Philosophy and Democracy,” in Middle Works 11:145) Thus, it is conceivable that there are differences though not necessarily innate/intrinsic/essential differences, between the categories male and female which in fact impact how each experiences (or causally interacts with) the world/their environment - and if either their epistemological presuppositions AND/OR their ontological commitments differ, it is problematic to say that a logical fallacy is NECESSARILY committed by suggesting that a man’, understanding of a woman’s problem differs from a woman’s understanding of the problem. 

Mysticism and metaphysics can differ in their methods of reasoning as @MauroALLEGRANZA commented. Additionally, they can differ in their aims - for example, mysticism, in contrast to metaphysics, can be thought of inter-alia as a tool helping to conceive the divine realm. Note however that according to these kind of characterizations most if not all of Chinese philosophy and possibly other non-Western philosophies might be taken as mere mysticism. 

N. R. Hanson regarded abduction as a significant kind of logic of discovery that differs from both deduction and induction. The term abduction was coined by Peirce to describe the inference from a phenomenon to a theory that if true would explain the phenomenon. Some philosophers use the term abductive inference to signify inference to the best explanation. But others treat abduction as distinct from inference to the best explanation: abduction, they say, concerns a single theory and reasons for taking the theory as a candidate for further exploration; inference to the best explanation rather involves the comparison of several theories and reasons for believing that one of the theories is probable or true. See the online Stanford Encyclopedia for further introductory overview: $URL$ And $URL$ 

Kurt Gödel was already a Platonist by that time. In fact - he presumed Platonism to be true already when he wrote his dissertation where he proved his completeness theorem. His belief in Platonism only grew stronger after he came up with his famous incompleteness theorems. See SE $URL$ for general review about his work. 

If the defining concept of trans theory, “Gender dysphoria”, is defined as “the condition of feeling one's emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite to one's biological sex,” and if the referenced “feeling” denotes a discrepancy between one’s behavioral predispositions and the behavioral dispositions deemed appropriate by one'ssociety/culture to one’s biological gender (the supposedly socially constructed gender role of one’s biological gender), then there would seem to be some contradiction between transgenderism and feminism as you have defined it (the traditional definition). If, however, with Commando, that “feeling” of dysphoria instead denotes somehow “experiencing” the neurological difference between a cis and a trans brain (see Commando’s comment and citation to a Scientific American article: “There are neurological accounts of gender (e.g. 1,) which do not commit to gender roles.”), then there need be no contradiction. However, the cited article would seem to open a can of worms. For what the article seems to imply is that there are four materially different brains (or brain types): cis male, cis female, trans male and trans female. If so, then it makes sense to reconsider whether “gender roles” are in fact social constructs or something else. (Moreover, such a scenario also addresses you “mind-body” problem by rendering it moot -- it is body (read brain) all the way down.) 

In other words, we are increasingly in the age of the instrumental model, not of theories about general laws of nature. In fact, the last sentence of the abstract is redolent of Richard Rorty’s suggestion that we move from objectivity to solidarity as the goal of inquiry. (It’s a shame that he failed to live long enough to see his vision begin to take hold in the culture; and maybe to comment upon whether and how “identity politics” may have hijacked his notion of solidarity.) The question I pose here is, in light of our intellectual history, what, if any, is the role of a public philosopher, a public intellectual, in the current “post truth” (read “post objective fact”) universe of discourse? 

But as a thought experiment, what are its consequences? Certainly they are not the same as those of the premise itself. And has anyone attempted to rehabilitate this notion, in a thought experiment or otherwise, in a manner other than the (fairly obviously futile) direct argument toward the concrete reality of the eternal return? 

But this is not necessarily the case- the above argument schema would say (roughly) for example that "There is possibly a man in my closet" implied "There is a man who is possibly in my closet", which are very different things (the latter seems to imply that you know of a particular guy, which seems somewhat stronger). This (I would say metaphysically shaky) argument schema is a corollary of the Barcan formula, and has stirred up some controversy. If we introduce it as an axiom, though, that makes for some logical gymnastics that properly transcend those of simple in-world deduction. The above considerations point to the nub of the difference between modal and classical logics. In short: deductions occur not just in worlds, but between them, and that means weird stuff goes down... 

In the latter period of his writings, a chap by the name of Ludwig Wittgenstein looked a second time at his earlier work and rather drastically changed his mind. In his first book, the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, he argued, among other things, that 

Looking at your profile before answering, this is a very tough question. The perennial realism/anti-realism debate essentially boils down to whether and how language (formerly -- pre 20th Century -- thoughts/experience) hook up to things/objects -- whether they be chairs, numbers or theorems. Given your level of logical, but not philosophical (ontology v. metaphisics v. epistemology), sophistication, and not knowing what you want to do with the knowledge/distinction, I would say start maybe with some light CS Pierce semiotics (though Kant and Carnap would also be likely starting points), then Quine (maybe Truth by Convention and On What There Is), Wittgenstein's Tractatus (first), then the Investigations (after reading about how it came to be that evolved/devolved (depending upon your tribe/camp) from the T to the I (which strikes me as precisely describing your state/dilemma), then read either the Blue and Brown Books and/or On Certainty. Then go to Hillary Putnam, maybe his Rethinking Mathematical Necessity, from his Words and Life collection of essays. (go here for a great essay with a priceless bibliography that is roughly on point: $URL$ Bon Appetit. 

How has [or will] the prevalence of “big data” – the exploding plethora of information and computing power to correlate it – impact[ed] (i) the scientific method’s theory/hypothesis formation, (ii) the underdetermination thesis, and (iii) the realist/relativist/ constructivist debate? The question might profitably be bifurcated in terms of the social sciences and the physical sciences.
