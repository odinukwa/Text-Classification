An internally geared system would be the quietest option available for a commuter set up. A groupset such as Rohloff, Shimano Alfine or SRAM would offer near silent operation. You could pair this with a belt drive train to reduce this further. This would also alleviate hub noise. The Rohloff probably has the quietest shifter as it is not indexed. For brakes I'm not sure if there is any difference between the noise made by rim vs. disc brakes although when they bite they may be louder than a coaster brake but much safer. Disc brakes would be my recommendation if your were considering cycling in the rain. There is no difference in noise between mechanical and hydraulic set ups but for commuting 140mm mechnicals would be just as effective as hydraulic brakes (unless your doing technical descents) as there would be very little differentiation in modulation and they are easier to maintain. Accessories will be all about what you choose, how you fit them and how you maintain the bike. You will need to keep things well lubricated to keep noise down (anything with a bearing) and taking time to fit things properly and to the right torques (such as bottom bracket). Pumps and tools can be placed in old tubes to keep them from rattling. For tires I dont think totally slick is the best option, also where you have said rain was an issue but something that had a specifically noise and puncture resistant tread and a low rolling resistence would be best for commuting. 

The simple answer is yes, you can just change the crankset without replacing the entire drive train however there are other considerations. Depends on if your changing rings out or replacing the set and cranks. Other considerations if doing a full replacement are: Chain line When selecting a new crank set you need to ensure it aligns with the current chainline of your bike. If you change the chain line you may not be able to use all of the gears on your rear cassette in all gears up front. Bottom bracket You need to ensure that a new crankset will be compatible with your current BB spindle length and interface. (square, octo, isis, hollowtech etc.) If your BB has a lot of wear once you have the cranks off its not a bad idea to change the BB at the same time as they're not that big a cost. Also it's sometimes if you get a good deal on a crankset to get a matching BB as they're the cheaper item. Chain length You may need to shorten the chain going to smaller rings if the derailleur doesn't provide enough tension. Rear derailleur capacity Not a problem when shifting to a smaller crankset but if going larger you would need to ensure that the rear derailleur would handle the additional cogs. There are tools online to help calculate this. Wear If the chain and rear cassette are showing signs of wear it's often wise to replace these at the same time as they will wear a new crankset faster. Chain width If you are buying a new crankset it has to be appropriate for the number of gears on your bike, this is because chains are different widths to accommodate more gears on the rear cassette. The rest of the drive train is sized to fit the chain width. 

The XCRs are very simple forks and unless specified don't have an oil or air damper so very user friendly. It is possible that water has got below the dust wipers but this is generally unlikely. The mechanism for a XCR is a sealed lock out unit and a coil. You should simply be able to drop the lowers off the fork without disrupting anything else to check them out for water and to ensure there's plenty of grease to protect the spring and other internals. The 'whum' could be the stanchions being a bit sticky moving through the wipers but not much else I can think off. 

I get probably five times as many punctures in my rear wheel as opposed to my front wheel. I run a good pressure and don't get obvious pinch flats. Does anyone have a logical reason why this could be happening? 

The best place to find what headset you need is the Crane Creek headset finder. Unfortunately in your particular case I thought the Mahuna has a straight 1 1/8 head tube and if so (correct me if I'm wrong) and therefore won't be able to take the tapered fork (easily, people have tried different things). Tapered steerers fit in tapered and 1.5 straight (with a reducing top headset) head tubes. 

The proper and safest option is to 'claim' the lane and act as if you were a car by sitting in the turning lane. This ensures that you are visible to motorists and if you follow the road rules you are more likely to gain respect of those around you. In a number of countries there are cyclist boxes in controlled intersections which offer even more security when sitting in front of traffic. In these instances you move to the front of the traffic during the red light phase. There are some motorists who dislike this however and you need to be watchful (and mindful) of irrational drivers who may take offence. 

I spent many years skateboarding before jumping on a bike and bearing maintenance (for identical bearings) was pretty key to making expensive bearings last much longer. I never used anything to waterproof the bearings from the outside (or heard of anyone who did) but took time to do regular maintenance. Guys with far lower mechanical skills than those who wrench bikes could do this stuff easily. You can remove the dust shield quite easily (some are held in by a split ring others just prise out) but you need to be careful. Once open remove the balls and retainer and clean them with a solvent based cleaner that doesn't leave a residue (so not WD40). Clean up the races and put all back together. Re-lube with a decent non dust attracting oil, I used to use sewing machine oil but now would just use a decent chain lube. Wipe down the shield replace it carefully and clean the outside of the bearing up to remove any lube residue. Place back on the axle dry and let the balls do their work. One problem with buying generic bearings to replace OEM ones is ensuring that they have similar properties to withstand impact and side loading forces. Most industrial bearings are designed and manufactured to spin in place at very high speeds with consistent external forces. You may get a good deal on the bearing but you'll likely have to replace them more often as they could fail significantly faster. 

No, you shouldn't apply to additional lube to new cables and housing. These come pre-coated (cables) and pre-greased (outers) so adding anything additional is not required and could possibly degrade the factory lube. 

The negative air chamber provides resistance to the positive air chamber. It controls the speed air spring returns to its initial shape. The chambers are isolated so the air is unable to equalise. The positive chamber provides resistance against compression, essentially how hard is the fork. The third part of the suspension action is dampening, the negative air chamber controls the forks return and the damper stops if from oscillating and provides a smooth ride. Rockshox explain dual air below quite well in suspension terms. 

Tapered 1.125/ 1.5 inch head tubes are common on many higher end mountain bikes in 2013 with more bikes and manufacturers heading this way. Most top suspension forks are offered in both straight and tapered steerers. It is possible to use a headset that reduces bottom width in tapered head tubes to a straight 1.125 steerer. Tapered headsets improve stiffness and strength. 

Today I bled an Avid Elixir 1 after it had gone soft over the winter. I followed the directions in the Park Tools Big Blue Book completely, used an Avid bleed kit and opened a new bottle of DOT 5.1. The bleed went well and the lever had good pressure afterwards. I went out for a couple of hours and came home and thought the brakes seemed softer. I stood the bike on its rear tyre and pumped the brake 10 times and by the end the lever was against the grip. I checked both plugs and they seemed to have a good seal. Any ideas on what I could have done wrong or could be wrong with the brakes to allow significant air into the system? 

I'd run them past your LBS for an opinion on what the cause may be. If it's a scratched stanchion I'd ask for a refund. Otherwise I'd lean towards sending them back also unless they were so cheap that they'd still be a cheap fork after a service. I wouldn't use them as is. Oil outside of seals attracts dust and then combines to turn into grinding paste which quickly removes the anodized coating from the stanchions. 

There are other factors that influence the price of a complete bike that may explain the difference between the 456 and the Codeine. The £899 45650B is an intermediate level specification whilst everything I have seen on the Codeine indicate it will have a high performance build. The differences from what I've seen include: 

The Sycamore could only be considered a mid-range bike. It had reasonable entry level components but nothing great. The tange chromoly frame would make a good base for a commuter but I think this was only a part frame so it may be quite heavy as opposed to a full chromoly frame. You would struggle to find a replacement fork if you were changing that due to its 1 inch head set. Not sure on the bottom bracket if it was cartridge this would be an easy change. It doesn't have tabs for disc brakes.U 

Rockshox have three different damper compression systems and remote kits. It is possible that if you have a compatible kit you could transfer it. You have to swap the standard motion control compression damper for a remote motion control compression damper. This wouldn't require any special tools but would require a reasonable level of ability. It may also involve topping up specialised suspension oil if any is lost. The systems are PushLoc, PopLoc and XLoc. 

If this is the original part on the bike use a site such as bikepedia to determine what came on the bike as new. Look at the rear shifter pod, if this is SRAM it is more than likely it is a SRAM derailleur, if it's Shimano its more than likely SHimano, they are not generally compatible. Count the sprockets on the rear cassette, this is a good starting piece of information to help working out what it is. Find any words on the cage, something is written there, google this. Find any other writing on the derailleur and google this. 

I don't think you are matching like for like and actually the price differential is quite small. The only fair way to compare two bikes is by looking at the frame only price. In this case I've been unable to find the frame only price for the Codeine (SingleTrack forum suggested £599 with Monarch R vs £225 for 456) so have used Santa Cruz instead: The frame only price for: 

I think you would find the bike handles reasonably on single track, 4x4 tracks and dirt paths but there are a few things to bear in mind. I'd ride single track but stick to trails graded easy. Where an MTB would be mandatory would be anything above that. The following features would require a MTB (or at least no gear or being on a short ride ie. mud). 

A 120mm 29er with Trail geometry would allow riding down large drops and rock descents and the shorter travel will also allow for sharper turning radius than a longer travel bike. There are a number of 120mm 29" bikes have been designed in the last few years to have a trail orientated geometry that is more progressive than that of 29" XC bikes (such as the Whyte T129 and the Specialized Camber EVO). They are designed for similar riding that you'd expect on 140mm/150mm 26". 29ers do not need as much travel as the wheels allow for a lot more compliance over rocks and roots. The ride won't be twitchy like an XC bike but it will be closer to the feel of a hard tail than an all mountain bike. 29" wheels may suffer more with more aggressive riding but this has to be balanced with the other advantages of wagon wheels. If stock wheels need replacing you can get a sturdier set to suit your riding. I wouldn't recommend a 29" if you were expecting to do any big jumps. 

I do find it interesting that you are commenting that you see a lot of 29ers retailling where you live, in New Zealand apart from XC bikes a huge proportion of the 2014 model years bikes that I am seeing at the moment are 650Bs. I think our market replicates that of the US where companies are moving to this as the new "standard". A good example is Giant who have committed to phasing out both 29 and 26" models on a 3 year glide path. Other manufacturers are offering strong 650B models in intemediate and advanced AM categories this year such as GT, Trek, Merida and Santa Cruz just to name a few. 

Install a trailer hitch or tow bar and use a hard mount rack. This is an expensive permanent solution if you don't have a trailer hitch installed. You can remove rack however and bike is very easy to get on and off rack. 

I don't think the science behind 27.5/ 650Bs make a convincing argument. Giant put a lot together to justify their move to 27.5s (glidepath to only that size in about 2016). There is a scientificish review here on PinkBike. This article and Giants move was pulled apart on this forum on Vorb - on Vorb it takes a few posts for things to move past general mud slinging, page 2 gets pictures and analysis. Personally I've never ridden a 27.5 (my sister has one but as it's a "girls" bike I couldn't possibly be seen on it) and my only experience on a 29er is on a FS and I found the ride too sedate compared to my steel HT. 

I've suffered from similar issues in the past and found a couple of easy options for avoiding rim holes that saw through valve stems. 

The BMC FS-02 has a BB92 Shimano Press-Fit. The answer was on the BMC website on the FS 02 page under technical details > concept BMC FS 02 For removal and installation refer to mattnz's post, ie. visit your LBS. 

Out of interest I would like to understand the benefits of having a 15mm or 20mm through axle over a 9mm QR (and a 10mm vs. a 12mm TA on the rear). What difference does it make to the ride?
