I have worked in an engineering company and many people I knew had lots of ideas for really good products, but no time and money to go off and try to make them. Managers are often not interested in pursuing science projects or experimental technology because there is a high risk of loosing money. As a result many engineers produce products way below their potential. 

Under that model there would of course be a lot of people who would realize they didn't need to earn a degree to make any money as long as their parents could buy them a couple of robots who would work for them. But hopefully some people would choose to educate themselves anyway. 

One strategy would be that each household owns a worker robot or two that they maintain that brings in income for that home. The humans in the home would spend most of their time in recreation and creative pursuits rather than work. In that case, those who were engineers may create some really cool stuff now that their time was freed up. 

What types of apps could be written would be a function of the hardware the nanobot has. Most of the apps on a phone center around having a speaker, microphone, graphics screen, touch sensing, accelerometer, GPS, wireless communication, a processor, and storage space. 

Societies often make the most advancement when people have the luxury of pursing art and science. One of the reasons Google has been so successful as a company is that they allow their employees to use 10% of their time on experimental projects (one example was google-sketchup). 

I know from experience that wire cloth cuts just fine with ordinary sewing scissors, although it does wear them out. Tin snips are a bit better for that job. 

Wait for an interstellar meteor or comet to arrive, and examine it. The meteor would serve as a sample of what the rest of the universe was made of. Does the meteor contains elements or isotopes that don't normally exist here? If the types of elements are similar then one could conclude that they may have been created by physical processes similar to those here (for example the fusion process in stars). Examine the molecular structure. Are the elements arranged in ways that don't normally occur here? Typically the compounds that form are those that are most favorable thermodynamically under some specified conditions. If we see moleculecular structures that normally wouldn't form here then we could conclude either that the surrounding conditions were very different when it was created, or that it was obeying different physical laws during its creation. 

Most military hardware includes nuclear event detectors that will shut down the electronics to protect them from the EMP associated with a nuclear blast. If a small burst of radiation were aimed at the tank the electronics would turn off until the crew manually reset everything. And of course it would be pitch black in there so it could take them a while. Those detectors are usually built into much of the essential hardware and cannot be disabled by the crew. The only way they could be disabled would be to send the components back to the defense contractors who built them and have them modified. The M1A2 is coated with a Chemical Resistant Agent Coating (CARC). If the creature were emit a strong acid that could dissolve both the CARC and steel then it could easily make a hole in the armor. Alternatively, the CARC can be scratched off pretty easily, so if you can scratch enough off you can dissolve the steel with acid that way. Think of the movie Aliens. There is no air conditioning in the M1A2. If you were to heat it from the outside the crew would be forced to come out. But the tank has a lot of thermal mass so that could take a while. You can stop the M1A2 by killing the crew. You can kill the crew if you can pry open the hatch. Pulling on the hatches until the locking pins break is much easier than piercing the armor, but still may require a few thousand pounds of force. The M1A2 uses a jet turbine motor. By its very nature the exhaust port can't be heavily armored. There is a covering over the exhaust, but its not as strong as the rest of the armor. In order for the tank to function the crew needs to see. The M1A2 typically includes optics with infrared and night vision. These are the primary means by which the crew can tell what is going on. If the optics were disabled the crew would be forced to use the manual port holes. Those port holes have much more limited visibility than the cameras. Due to the limited visibility they may be tempted to open the hatch to get a better view (at least until they learned better). The infrared camera only works if the creature is emitting some heat. So cold blooded would be helpful. All of the cameras have exposed lenses. If the lens were to break the camera wouldn't work. The lens could be smashed, dissolved, or covered with some opaque substance spit out by the creature. If the creature emitted some sort of mist they would be unable to see or target it effectively. The tank itself has smoke grenade launchers for that very purpose. The tank has various antennas that stick out for radio and GPS. If they were pulled off the tank would be unable to call for help. Another way to get the crew to exit would be to emit a strong horrible sound through the armor. Once they opened the hatch the hunt is over. The main 120mm gun on the M1A2 is very powerful but has a low reload speed because a crew member has to manually change each bullet. That could take around 6 seconds between shots. If they miss the first shot that gives the creature plenty of time to get close without worrying about the main gun. The turret has a 50 cal machine gun mounted next to the main gun on the turret so the creature would still have to avoid that while covering the distance. Its a bit out of scope for this question because the creature would have to be small, but just after firing the main gun, the next action the crew takes is to open the breach and reload a round. With the breach open, there is a direct route from the tip of the main gun barrel to the inside of the crew compartment. An intelligent snake like creature with a diameter of less than 120mm could theoretically crawl right up the barrel and into the crew compartment while the crew was reloading. It would need to have tough skin though because it may suffer burns crawling through the barrel. Most animals become injured when they are punctured by a bullet because it ruptures blood vessels and destroys organs that there may only be one or two of. But creatures with different anatomy may suffer far less damage. For example a sea sponge has no internal organs and is essentially homogeneous in construction. You can't really kill it by putting holes in it. A creature that didn't have a pressurized circulatory system wouldn't bleed out. A tree for example is able to live and regenerate even if its cut down to the stump in many cases. 

Start an investment company that sells short term bonds in exchange for precious metals or cash. People send you money to invest and expect 130% back. You duplicate the money and gold they send (thus having twice as much). You than pay out 30% of what you duplicated to your investors, and keep the other 70%. Most bonds don't earn anywhere near 30% short term, so you will naturally attract a lot of investors. The investors themselves will unwittingly launder all the money for you as they ship the bills and gold back and forth. 

Observe the stars. For example, if you could observe a binary star system through a telescope, and watch the motion of the stars as they interact with eachother via gravity, and if that interaction matches your own model of gravity then you can conclude with a high degree of confidence that gravity was acting the same in that location. The light emits from plasma forms narrow bands when separated by a prism. In general the type of element can usually be identified by the observed light spectrum. For instance we assume our sun consists of hydrogen and helium because the light it emits matches the spectrum emitted by hydrogen and helium. If you look at a star and the light coming from it looks like the light coming from locally generated plasma then you can conclude that the processes that generated that light are probably similar. Since the process which generates that light is highly dependent on the way that subatomic particles interact with each-other, one could conclude that those particles generating the observed light behave very similar to the ones here. Of course all of our observations could be an illusion. The odds would be pretty low of having an illusion that so closely matches the rest of reality by pure chance. More likely would be a deliberate illusion.

We do have the ability to construct a massive ship, but we don't have the technology to launch one. Your best bet is to construct the ship in orbit around the moon. That saves you the large amount of fuel you would need to get it off the earth. The diameter of most payloads on existing rockets is limited to just a few meters. Any ship you could construct in orbit using conventional rockets would have to be made of hundreds of small modules, either put together like a honey comb (which would actually be pretty rugged in case of hull breaches), or a series of segments like the ISS. Also, if you want everyone to survive the radiation, the hull would need to be metal that is several feet thick. Also having a hull that thick would be necessary to survive thousands of years of colliding with space dust and micro-meteors. That would be way to heavy to launch from the ground. Secondly shipping raw materials from the earth even to low earth orbit is about $2000 a pound at todays commercial prices. The moon is actually pretty rich in Titanium, which you could use to build the hull. It could be much cheaper to set-up a mining and casting operation on the moon that could fabricate the largest metal pieces of the ships hull. You could use a space-elevator going from the moon's surface to lunar orbit to get the large metal parts from the surface of the moon into orbit around the moon where you are building the ship. That would be significantly cheaper and easier than rockets. A space elevator from the earth is not possible with todays technology because carbon-nano-tube ropes with sufficient fiber length are not yet mass-producible. But a space elevator from the moon is possible with conventional steel cable due to the lower gravity. Companies like LiftPort (www.LiftPort.com) have already developed every part of the space elevator technology and are only awaiting more money, and a customer. Your ship will need to be completely self-sufficient once its flying, so you will need machine shops on board that can make or repair every part of the ship, and fabricate every type of micro-chip or circuit card. As it happens, you can save a lot of money by fabricating the machine shops on the moon as a module, and then using them to initially build the rest of the ship. At some point in the construction, the fabrication facilities are moved from the lunar surface to become part of the ship itself. That means that you get most of the cost of the moon base for free since it was really just part of the ship. Also, very importantly, by using the ships own machine shops to initially build the ship you prove that you can really repair and replace any part of the ship using the tools and processes available in those machine shops. It eliminates the possibility of forgetting something until after launch. Over time things on the ship will break. Those machine shop modules will need to make or repair every part of the ship, and fabricate every type of micro-chip or circuit card. Also you should have multiples (at least 3) of every tool or system, so that if one breaks there is a backup. Also, its better if each backup system is not identical so they don't all fail at exactly the same time due to the same disaster. You will need a nuclear reactor to power the ship. A solar array won't generate much power as you move away from the sun. The trip time could be just a few years or decades if the planet is in our solar system, or perhaps one of Jupiter's large moons. The trip time will most likely be 1000s of years not 100s if the planet is outside our solar system. The ship design would be vastly different depending on which scenario you choose. If you just need to travel a few years/decades you could get away with just recycling water and air, with a huge storehouse of dried/canned food. If you have to leave the solar system then you will need to recycle everything. We do have recycling technology. The toilet on the international space station for example recycles all the urine back into water for the astronauts. But of course plants will do that also if you like. I already mentioned some price cutting measures, but its worth noting that one can't really estimate the cost of this design by comparing it to historical rocket prices which are based on the way the US government builds things by bidding them out to way over-priced defense contractors. The reason Space-X was founded was because Elon Musk realized that the price that Boeing/Lockheed were charging the U.S. gov for rockets was about 100x the cost of the raw materials. Secondly, building a much larger ship would probably get a further price break due to economies of scale. Thirdly, the 500 people who are going on the ship need to know how to build it anyways in case something breaks. So they might as well build it themselves the first time (so you save a lot on labor costs). A good portion of the people you bring will have to be PHD level scientists and engineers who are capable of doing the ship design. Elon Musk, founder of Space-X wants to make mankind a multi-planet species. So someone like him might be willing to pay for the construction of the moon base, in exchange for your group doing the design and construction work for free and then giving him the rights to sell access to the base, or license the plans to others for profit. It really would be a great deal for him because most of the cost of developing anything is the labor cost to all the scientists and engineers, and techs who build it. In fact every part of the ship design could be license or sold for profit to help finance further construction. There are plenty of private billionaires and governments who might be interested. You may be able to lease access to the moon base to venture capitalists interested in mining precious metals from the moon. Private billionaires are often motivated, adventurous people, and maybe some of them will want to go too. They may see great opportunity in being in on the ground floor of the founding of a new planet. So if you could convince a few dozen of them to go along that could provides some funding too.
