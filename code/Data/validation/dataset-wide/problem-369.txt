There are two approaches you could take here. Semi-Permeable Membranes Membranes of this type allow only certain ions or particles via diffusion or passive/active transport. A dialysis machine for example uses this sort of membrane. For ion transport, these require a carrier fluid. Oxygen, Nitrogen and CO2 are all mildly soluble in water, so we could use something water-based as the carrier. In this situation, the membrane is just a sieve with an extremely fine mesh size. Well-controlled, this mesh would only allow your selected compounds through. Sickness or mutation could cause this to malfunction in similar ways to how kidney disease affects humans. Interestingly, this means that compounds with a similar physical size to your usual source will be allowed through. This is similar to why carbon monoxide ends up in our bloodstream. It has a similar size and charge to oxygen, and thus gets through the sieve. To prevent poisoning via these chemicals, a secondary mechanism is present in most complex life forms. Biochemical Filters Our liver is one of these. It uses various enzymes and chemical pathways to process chemicals in our bloodstream, and neutralise toxins. This type of filter is often employed after initial size and charge filtering via the normal input pathway (the lungs in this case). Let me get back to your question. 

A "swarm" of small black holes may do the trick. Note that such swarm is highly unlikely to exist naturally as it would collapse, so it should be a creation of some advanced civilization. Such swarm would be devastating locally (when swaying across a planet or star), move at the speed you want, and have not special effect from far away, just the usual gravitational impact of their mass. The exact size of these small black holes is to refine depending of the effects you want to achieve. The size of the swarm is also quite open. The stability over time of such swarm may need some handwaving, however. And well, regarding where it comes from... ... let's say that it is a minefield from of a Kardashev type III civilization ! 

As far as mathematical options go, the best ones I know have already by suggested. I will suggest a different option, used by the Spartans. The Scytale. Basically you wind your medium around a rod and write along the rod. When the medium is unwound you get nothing but shuffled letters. The description in Wikipedia makes this most basic implementation appear easily breakable. While I am no expert, I suppose a few twists could be added: Don't align letters with stripes. If you always place your letters on the stripe perfectly, you have nothing but reshuffled letters. This is easily breakable, by statistical analysis of the letter frequency. Instead use very, very thin stripes, so that mere dots are found on each, offering no clue to which letter they belong. This might be difficult to reproduce by hand, but Heinrich will let a machine do the winding for him. Very neatly and reproducibly. Don't use a simple rod In the event that the stripes are found, the cryptanalyst will have the patience to test all kinds of rod diameters. Therefore, don't use a rod of fixed diameter, but rather a complicated shape, similar to what you get by spinning an elaborate key around the long axis, or the ones found here. Disguise the data as everyday objects Unfortunately, I do not know the shape and size of 19th century sewing spools, so I will take today's situation as a guide. If I had enough trusted technicians, I would use sewing yarn, or something resembling it as a medium. I would manufacture a machine typing on the yarn, while it is of course wound around the intricately shaped rod. It would type in tiny letters, wind and unwind the yarn for me and reading would be easy with a magnifying glass. When storing the data, I would wind it on an ordinary spool. I would take care to leave some yarn blank, so the outside of the yarn (when on an ordinary spool) would be blank and inauspicious. If my typing/printing technique is good enough, I can even hide my yarn inside Gobelins, carpets, clothes, for longer travel. Problems Yarn has an axis of rotation. To avoid that becoming a problem, you must have the ink seep through the yarn. That might be difficult to achieve uniformly. And you must leave blank layers, to avoid damaging layers below. 

Before asking How they could develop use to tools or advanced technology, you should probably ask Why they would develop it. From your great artwork, Sphinx's seem to be efficient predators and specialized for it. Why would they bother throwing a rock at a target while they have such powerful natural weapons ? So you definitely must find a rationale putting some pressure on the Sphinx's to do so. The problem here is that de-specialization of body parts is very rare. Specialized traits (sharp teeth, claws) are reinforced over time, because individuals with less stronger traits are less efficient and die quickly. For humans, the switch from forest environments to plains is believed to have make our initial hands used for tree climbing useless, so that it could evolve in other directions. The same cause made the bipedal behavior an asset to spot predators and food. Our hand allowed several usage, and the related brain capacity was possible due to our standing position. Adding meat and fat in our food gave us the ability to sustain the highly-demanding energy consumption of our brain. Fire allowed food cooking, rendering big jaws useless and giving more room for brain expansion. Social interactions coupled with such brain allowed for more and more knowledge transmission and ultimately language. Even for mankind, the interactions between all these events are discussed, but most agree that environmental changes were key in the process that today allow you to read this on a high-tech device. Coming back to your Sphinx's, you could give a try to think in the same way. What render their specialization useless, forcing them to go in another direction ? Were their usual preys replaced by others that could resist to their attack ? Or were too fast ? Or flying ? Note that predators are already specialized in some way and harder to push in another direction, but you're the author ;) 

Simple drugs, such as Ibuprofen. Cheap presbyopia glasses. They are sold on the street for a couple of Euros in several Balkan countries and though not fitting the person exactly, would still be invaluable to them. It would be very hard to remake them, even if you get a pair. No need to fear causing a technical revolution (which rules out clocks, the dissembling of which would probably cause a lot of innovation). They were invented some time before 1286, but still very expensive. EDIT: There is this painting by Conrad von Soest, from AD 1403 showing the use of spectacles. So the best method would probably be to just give them the lenses - which were the veeery expensive part - and let them fashion a contemporary frame. Alternatively, you could gift them monocles with metal frames. 

Not necessarily. Logistics The answer to any question of "should we do X" can always be rephrased as "is the benefit of doing X greater than the cost(s) of doing X". So let's rephrase: In a civilisation that has access to tonnes of planets, would vertical farming outweigh the cost of setting up the farms? For certain planets, the answer would be yes. Temperate planets that are close to existing hub worlds for example would have low cost of transport for goods manufactured on them (food included), thus more extreme forms of manufacturing (such as vertical farms) could be utilised before it becomes inefficient to build more dense and/or complex systems. It's not just a matter of the space required, but also the world's climate (and how easily it can be terraformed), as well as how it relates to the economy at large. If it is in a convenient location, or is highly abundant in a particular resource, then it may be worth it to employ advanced engineering techniques to maximise the utility of that planet. 

They made humans magical, but none knows details Humans were an unmagical species in a world full of residual magic, left over perhaps by the elves... These creatures transform magic into biological existence, releasing a tiny fraction of magically saturated air. Upon inhaling that, humans slowly develop magical abilities. Nobody knows this, but it has been observed that the presence of the Grindlequark (or whatever it is called) greatly benefits spell casters. It is even rumoured that total isolation from grindlequarks for one year and one day renders one unmagical. This is all the more true of magically imbued artefacts, which abound in the library. Unfortunately for some dark wizards, the practice of preparing Tumbleweed-Grindlequark stew has not enhanced magical power in any palpable manner. But many still cherish it for its reputation and thick, savoury quality. Therefore the library not only doesn't dream of exterminating the Grindlequark, but novices are actually assigned to individual Grindlequarks, vouching for their safety and beckoning to their every whim. The creatures have proved remarkably adept in discrediting novices who don't guess the wishes they communicate through guestures and grimacing... If there is a competing race, eager to render humans unmagical again, they might even kill Grindlequarks in the wild, so the keeping of sanctuaries would be all the more important. 

I see a some issues here: The maintenance of a ship is not negligible, especially in water and without advanded technology to build it. On earth, non-steel ship were made of wood. And sea lifeforms can severely damage wood over time. You usually have to repair holes, change some parts, and this is usually done by taking the ship out of the water. Doing this on a gigantic moving ship seems quite impossible without some handwaving here (magic, unknown material...) The size of the ship is significant. Low estimates of the area needed to feed an adult with a 2300 cal vegetarian diet are 0.44 acres (total 4400). Medieveal urban density is about 60 people per acre, so this would be small (170 acres) compared to the food area. So food production and houses for 10.000 people would require 18.5 sq. km (4.3 x 4.3 km). This is not completely unrealistic, but it cannot be a classical ship: sea faring would break the structure. It would be loosely coupled parts bound together, a kind of floating city and gardens. Such structures exist, including floating gardens, for example on the Inle Lake. But lakes have less constraints that seafaring: even modern ships can be broken or severely damaged by wave. A floating city would be at great risk. And once your gardens are full of salty water, no more tomatoes. First conclusion is that it is unrealistic: unsustainable, engineering nightmare, fragility. Not sure how you can fix this without some special material here... 

I think “most powerful” is too vague a term. If divine magic is the most powerful in everything, I see no other way than reducing the users, as @Rekesoft already suggested. But looking at the real world we observe members of various cults don’t take kindly to your following any cult but theirs. I therefore propose a number of rivalising gods, each forbidding or discouraging the worship of others and granting powers in specific fields only. Any of these cults will have to ally to secular powers and secular magicians for access to a broader spectrum of magic. Assuming secular magic has a broader field of application. This kind of factionalism can help you build a complex and interesting web of interaction, perhaps with a twist due to an unexpected alliance? 

Water is composed of elements that are very common in the universe : Hydrogen (rank #1) and Oxygen (rank #3). This makes water (H2O) one of the most common molecule in the universe. So from an economic standpoint, its choice as currency is definitely not a good one. In the solar system, most water will be found as ice. It may contain other organic molecules in comets or asteroids, or some other components on planets & satellites (salt, etc.). If you need it to be pure, you'll probably have to refine it somewhat. 

If "all nutrients were taken out", the remaining stuff is just water. Your survival expectation relying only on water are limited : 

Adding personnality and emotions to a powerful weapon seems a very risky thing to do. You make it unreliable and less efficient. The only (vague) advantage would be some unpredictability that would create some surprize effects, but I strongly doubt this would be efficient. Emotions are not an advantage for beating us at chess or poker, while would it be in a war context ? Even if the reality of war has magnitude more complexity that such games, I cannot imagine any emerging property of such environments where non-rationale behaviour would be helpful.
