Many Kammaṭṭhāna (working places, or themes of meditation/reflection/visualisation), which are taught by the Buddha, are actually visualisations in regard of signs.

People (e.g. those having left home, having left stinginess) who have mastered the fist step, who have gained the strainless eye of Dhamma, have neither doubts nor do they ponder much about it. So why, if really like to know, don't simply follow them and why, if not follow them ponder about that much, being not you issue yet? If seeking for doubters and waste a live by pondering around, there is a community working hard on being wiser as the elders for more then 2500 year. Simply join, there are plenty on topics on it. It's like science or watching news, everyday some new personal opinions. If more tend to uproot doubt, to know for youself, avoiding association with doubt, foremost outwardly and also inwardly. Associate with admirable friends. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial purpose and other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange] 

The ego has survival instincts hardwired into our bodies. These survival tendencies are what give rise to greed, ignorance and hatred. This is what creates suffering. To be conscious of this process is the aim of most Buddhist paths. This awareness itself is what gives rise to our capacity to choose something other than what our programming demands. Thus, "free will" as opposed to "will". Will implies that our choices are predetermined, which is true when the ego reigns. Free will is the entire point of our chasing enlightenment to begin with. This is why Buddhism exists, and why it's called "liberation" in English. 

This is a question of law. In some places, the laws will allow one parent, or even no parents, since it's a matter of religious preference. In other places, the laws are strict, and require both parents' permission. This is also a question of the sangha's policies. Most will have an age limit because they observe a need to gain life experience. Some will permit children, and others will even seek after them, so that children will not be unduly influenced by outside ideas. So it depends a lot on who is asking, and who is doing the ordaining. Ordination can be a big deal. Mostly, though, it's merely feeling a call to serve others, seek the best interests of the world and promote its well-being. Nobody needs an ordination for that, but it helps to have a legal piece of paper to avoid certain troubles. 

So focus on gaining right view, it's pre-requisites. For it is not pleasant to be sooner or later confronted with suffering, when sickness, death, lose of beloved, gain of pain... arises and one does not find the way to release, does not know, have not discerned, seen before, here and now. Asking: Tackling Addictions Directly or Meditation: Respect, Confidence and Patient as prerequisite means for release from addiction, when and before is effects come into be. And what are the obstacles, the Hindrances for devotion, for lowering, Individually?

Another fart, this question. Again about the "upekkha" of people not having done their homework, Eggman:

Taken on such on high level, this is by the way the reason why monks and certain brahmans are often adressed as "lord of compassion", because of the gift of virtue and then the other trainings and for teaching possible the way to end suffering. So compassion in action on the eightfold path helps actually every being, and ideas, like even favored by deluded minds here, giving cause to be corrected for those able to see through defilements, have no rightous ground at all. Since this is actually a place that gives much reason to face the suffering of beings, caught in wrong views, here is planty place to spread compassion, pity for them, since that grave hopeless situation no one can directly posible help, is indeed a field that "cries" for compassion and may lead later to righous equanimity "beings are heirs of their kamma", that's then dwellingin emptiness, not possible to gain without having done the right deeds in body, speech and mind befor. So the matter in short, incl. act-ually all being: 

I never expected this kind of a question in here! :D But let's see if we can help out a bit. The peace you lack is because you can't accept that she disagrees. You are struggling to be right, and so is she. Perhaps some clarity would help: she's the only one who can clearly tell you her feelings on this, so she's the one you have to talk to in order to resolve this. The pain is because you are trying to have control over the situation (based on your explanation of things). And so I would recommend meditation on why you feel the need to control and dominate this decision. It's not hers; it's yours. You are the one who has to live with the consequences of making it in either case. Except that she believes it also impacts her (and she wouldn't oppose it if she thought it would turn out well). Consider her input, find out if she's willing to help you understand, and by all means listen! But if she isn't convincing to you, consider what it is that she's seeing, and try to come up with a way that it won't be an issue for her. Generally, there is no way to avoid conflict, but if you take it from a position of having her explain her reasons to you so that you can understand why she's so opposed to it, you may find a solution you're looking for and avoid further issue.

In as far one has a unfortune rebirth: not meeting, listening/hearing, reflecting, comprehending the Dhamma: therefor not developing the path. Or if not seen Dhukkha, having heard...comprehended the dhamma, hoping when death or real fear approches to remembering it, the known Dhamma. Still no fear? Still no suffering? Or still not read, reflected, comprehend the good Dhamma? Just await here the next birth in an another answer then. Some like to make merits and that gives possibilities for those with faith in it. 

Eggman, are the homework assignments done? The basic works? If not, there is no base to build on. To get attached to aesthetic, to beauty of nature, is very needed, since one starts to practice that what gives cause to: long life, beauty, happiness and strength: Dana, Sila, Bhavana. The contemplations for that, after having the items understood, having developed the objects of contemplation, are this six found here: [Q&A] What should one meditate upon as a beginner? (Bhavana for Laypeople) As for the nature (plants animals), which is really not a ground for joy to contemplate, but a place to see how poor certain existances can be, to understand the confusion, its worthy to understand The Roots of Buddhist Romanticism. To see beauty in the ugly, good in bad... to even train such is a foolish practice of the fool. That is why real aesthetic objects are chosen. Not such without any generosity, virtue and even wisdom... nature is good to be wise reflected to develope samvega, "fear". (Seems to be redundant questioning of yours... there is no way aside of simply putting firts generosity and then virtue just into practic, Eggman.)

Simplicity is considered virtuous. Spaciousness is the accompaniment of emptiness. But all are perceptive; objectively, neither spaciousness nor emptiness exists, because we are filled with space, or we are filled with something else. There is a dimensional zero as much as there is a dimensional one. But in the abstract sense, both are numbers, and therefore the same. Truly accomplishing yourself means that you understand that the perceptions are illusions; but the illusions are what we have to work with, and so are the only truth we have. Hope that makes sense. 

A kōan is nothing more than a puzzle that seems self-contradictory or paradoxical, and yet contains a teaching of truth in it. Those who want a book about it are probably unqualified to create kōans to begin with. That being said, each sangha (whether online or not) can adopt kōans as they see fit, whether validated by a group of masters or not. Such validation serves only to give a thorough review of the proposed kōan, and doesn't pertain to whether or not it validly teaches, since the acceptable answers can vary greatly between students and even teachers. The abstract quality of a kōan to begin with makes it an uncertain thing at best, anyway. There is not any particular qualification, other than understanding what a kōan actually is, in its full and ineffable truth. Any book on the subject would necessarily have to ignore the ineffable (e.g., indefinable) part of that, and so would completely miss the point of the abstract. But if it was to teach you what you need to get to the level of abstract comprehension, that would suffice, and there are lots of those.

Does Buddhism experience suffering with tolerance, or diminish suffering by elimination? What ever Buddhism could do, does, should, even experiences... The Buddha told, and such is it recited: 

Marijn and who ever might be interested, assuming that the question was raised in seek for release: First: ❋ Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammā-sambuddhassa ❋ Restlessness and Remorse (nervous or scared) is one of the five hindrences and ne needs - aside of it being perceived, become aware of it - by coming aware of it, knowing it as hindrence, be abounded. The means and ways for that are found in a compiled work here, based on teachings by the Buddha, found in the canon: The Five Mental Hindrances and Their Conquest The two mental faculties (indriya), right concentration (samadhi) and right mindfullness (sati) are the means to abound it. The cause of concentration is rature, the cause of rapture is freedom from remorse, or conviction. How is the freedom from remorse developed: by acts of generosity, by keeping the precepts without spot. And how is conviction developed? By reminding the Buddhas quality, the Dhammas quality, the Sanghas quality, by reminding ones generosity, by reminding ones virtue, by reminding, calling in mind, ones virtues equal those of the devas. (The six reflections) So by taking/asking for refuge, by taking/asking for the precepts, by devotion and acts of it as preperation, the basement is developed. See for this required proper prepairation: Respect, Confidence and Patient and probably Devotion, basicly requirement because without respect and gratitude (e.g. right view) no right object of joy, no joy no right concentration, no right concentration no release. So is it that right view is the forrunner for right release and by wrong view wrong releas comes into be. And what is right view? 

One of the teachings of my own tradition is the use of inner imagery after overcoming bias. Our inner accuracy improves once we learn to identify what is biased and what is not, and this could be called 'clairvoyance' by most, though this doesn't necessarily mean you are seeing what is there. It is also said that siddhi meditations develop human superpowers, as well. But in the case of siddhi, there is a lot of esoteric learning that has to happen first, some of which is lost to time. 

This feeling isn't unexpected. But to ask if it's expected... one of the meditative points is to overcome the need to have expectations. If we expect something to happen and it doesn't, then we're more or less causing suffering to ourselves; if we expect something to not happen and it happens, then we're causing the same kind of suffering: conflict and stress from that conflict which arises from dramatising the lack of control we have over the world. It's not unexpected for strange reactions to occur with any form of meditation. It could be that your focus has gone so deeply on one thing that you're no longer focusing on your "where" but instead are looking at your "what" and the interconnections between mind and heart. Re-check the discipline you're being taught, and manage the situation by reconfirming that you aren't making any obvious mistakes. But once you've done that, it's not necessarily a mistake; it's likely just a reaction from ahaṃkāra (ego). Over time and with practice, it should diminish. As to whether or not this is a mistake in practice, I think this classifies as "overthinking the situation". Accept that it happens, and it's a part of your experience. Eventually, you may even get into a state of non-locality, which would be excellent. While I wouldn't consider this non-locality, it certainly points to that as a possibility for future practice. But you can't make it happen; it just has to grow into that. My answer would then be: Let go of your worry. It isn't serving you well. 

Such is impossible for a person with giant ego, totally overestimating one self. Such a person will of course, guided by his defilements, prefer to dwell in his "emptiness" (e.g. in his ignorance). At least, one IS able to help every being - to pull away the ground of such foolish ideas: even if one might not see certain lack, does not know certain mind, in keeping precepts, being without intention to harm, has threefold rght intention, one helps all beings. 

One can gain pīti (satisfaction) by turning to asubha, unbeauty objects, yes. You might look at the answer on What is the logic behind visualization meditation But since you nature is an aversive, especially starting by lack of compassion to yourself, it's not recommended, given your seek after pleasure, and the insight that aversion migh not be conductive as well. Again, aside of Dukkha, it seems as if the is not much base for now, so rather to focus on building a palace in a swamp, focus on virture and much, much generosity, = reducing consuming but giv, give up, serve... Is there still attachment when we want the benefits of pleasure not for themselves, but for an altruistic or wider goal? Seek after sensual pleasure kills, sensuallity is the reason for killing and wars in this world: How can there be any alturistic be included in such? But, to do not understand wrong: the pleasure gained by Jhana is said to be outside the sphere of the five strings and such pleasure does not cause remorse if enjoyed. 

So, your question is from outside the perspective of Buddhism, which I have to say is wonderful. From the Buddhist perspective, the word "truth" in English has multiple meanings which don't always strictly mean the objective truth of a situation without bias. For example, the Four Noble Truths are not true in the sense of "true/false" but rather in the sense of "true to the ideal"—in their case, true to the ideal of overcoming suffering. They are "truths" in that they are statements about that ideal as the Buddha taught, rather than being "false" and diverging from it. We should each measure the truth of these by experience, rather than by any absolute truth or falsehood. Trying to talk about them in this sense shows a degree of lacking knowledge, and it doesn't apply in that sense. So, no, it's not that these words are removed; it's that they don't apply in the way you want to apply them. They are faithful to the ideal teachings of the Buddha, and so cannot be claimed as false, even if they are found false by the measure of any particular person's experience. 

-- Reflection on death -- Reflectikn on the (parts) of the body -- Reflection on (one of the 10) corpse -- Reflexion on the uglyness of food Best possible to see suffering if one leaves the palace, the secure home and inspects the world outside a little: hospitals, cemeteries, slayer halls... might be possible near. Or reflective listening to certain lyrics of Iron Maiden, Metallica... reflective, not singing, delight in sound and stressed bang the head...
