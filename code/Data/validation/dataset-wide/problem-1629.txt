Regarding the meme's statement that "conspicuous in their absence are the 3 Muslim countries with which Trump does business": While the meme doesn't explicitly define what it considers to be a "Muslim country," if we define "Muslim countries" to mean "majority-Muslim countries," according to Wikipedia's list of Islam by Country, there are approximately 52 such countries or territories, 45 of which are absent from Department of Homeland Security's list. The three excluded countries listed in the meme are hardly alone among Muslim-majority in being absent from the list, nor is their absence particularly 'conspicuous.' There are a number of other Muslim-majority countries in which terrorism concerns are more widespread than in any of those three countries which are also absent from the list, such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, for example. 

In this article and many others, I read that cows are contributing to the climate change more than cars in releasing CO2. 

In this video it is claimed that the person who designed it was passing the statue of Virgin Mary with 12 stars and applied it to the design of the flag. How much of this claim is true? 

There is a claim spreading around and I'd like to know if this is correct from the astronomical side. 

Did this happen and continue happening in the skies? Can the astronomers see this event or is this just some made up story to support their correlation? 

According to this article wearing cellphones in the front pocket can cause men lose their fertility. 

Additionally, this cost is not just for Trump, Melania, and Barron, but also for Trump's adult children and their families: 

November 8 to January 20th is 74 days. $35 million / 74 days is about $473,000 per day. Mr. de Blasio also noted that assuming this would apply to the period after Trump takes office is premature. Snopes is still waiting on getting more up-to-date information: 

On December 7, 2016, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City was interviewed by a local TV station. During the interview, de Blasio was asked about these costs: 

The cited CNN article is from November 21, 2016, while Trump was the President-Elect and was still himself living in Trump Tower prior to taking office and moving to D.C. It says: 

According to this article, the birth-control hormones were found in the rivers and even ended up in the drinking water. Amway dealers claim that only their water purifier can remove these hormones since they are too small to be extracted by a standard water purifier. Their product is much more expensive for the reason I mention. I know their products are normally overpriced and I think it's just a trick to sell it. I worry about the quality of the water now and thinking of getting a water purifier. But are my worries actually rational or should I really get a purifier? The main claims regarding a contraception hormones found in drinking water are that they affect people's fertility or general health, or even the main cause of the rise of homosexuality. 

Obama has released his birth certificate, and the State of Hawaii confirms that it is real. op cit - previous answers Article 4 of the US Constitution states, in part, 

$URL$ This article is a newspaper Q/A column, where the issue is discussed. Basically, every benefit claimed in the original question is real, and measurable and completely insignificant for personal automobile use. TLDR; If you're flying a plane or racing on a track, nitrogen can be beneficial. If you're driving to and from work, you'll probably end up spending more on nitrogen than it will save you. Also, see: $URL$ My mechanic claims that it stops pitting in alloy rims, but I haven't found any evidence to support that, (Nor have I found any evidence that pitting is a bad thing over the average life of an automobile.) 

I carry my smartphone in the front pocket all day long, not just one hour and this kind of information really disturb me. If phones really have these devastating effects on men, it should be prohibited and cellphone companies sued. It's like selling uranium or whatever poison. Why there isn't enough research done so this claim can be proved right or wrong for good? 

In this video and this article skydiver attempts to jump without a parachute. I can see in the video that his front(stomach) is bigger and possibly hiding something. Did he have the parachute hidden in the front and planning to open only in case his dropping gets out of the route and misses the target? Or is there a total prove he didn't have any parachute at all? 

The 6000 year old figure comes from the Genealogies in the bible -Ussher - He added up the lifetimes from Jesus (1 AD) back to Adam. The Genealogies are surprisingly complete. If you believe in the non-miraculous parts of the bible, it's actually a decent way of figuring out the date of "The Fall of Man." Let us assume, that there was a man called Adam, who was the first follower of Jehovah, and that he lived some time on the order of 6000 years ago. If we accept that, there is still no evidence that the "Adam" who was kicked out of Eden is the same Adam who was "created" on the sixth day. What we cannot assume, unless we are biblical literalists, is that the garden of Eden and creation stories are anything but metaphor. The "days" in creation could very well be arbitrary periods of time on the order of millions or billions of years. Peter alluded to this possibility when he said "... With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. [NIV]"2 Peter 3:8 So, even taking the Judeo-Christian genealogies, we still have very weak evidence of a young earth. The only people who believe this are the aforementioned literalists, who believe in the young earth because they are literalists. (That is, they are not literalists because they believe in a young earth.) TLDR: The only evidence for a young earth is biblical. Take it as you will. 

8 USC 1187(a)(12) defines countries whose nationals are explicitly excluded from the U.S. Visa Waiver Program due to terrorism-related concerns. Iraq and Syria are explicitly included in this list by law. The other countries on the list are designated by the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security due to terrorism-related concerns in those countries. The most recent update to this list of countries prior to Trump's executive order was issued by President Obama's Secretary of Homeland Security on February 18, 2016, just under a year prior to Trump's executive order. 8 USC 1187(a)(12)(A) provides that the Secretary of State may designate to this list any country "the government of which has repeatedly provided support of acts of international terrorism." 8 USC 1187(a)(12)(D) provides the authority for the Secretary of Homeland Security to add countries (or areas) to this list: 

A surgical mask is designed to protect the patient from the germs of the surgical staff. They are actually rather ineffective as personal protection. What they are good at is stopping germs from coughing and sneezing. A better solution would be a paper construction filter. It would at least filter out larger dust particles that have deposited radioactive particles on them. 

What this means, is that Barack Obama is a natural born citizen solely for the reason that Hawaii says he is. No other argument is necessary or required. The only way to counter this argument is to have Hawaii repeal the certificate. I realize that this doesn't answer the implied question "Where was Barack Obama really born?" But it does shoot a hole into any Arizona laws intending to keep Obama off the ballot. If Hawaii says he's eligible, then Arizona has to respect that. 

I come across another Indiegogo project that promises a weight loss just by carrying their device on the head. This device stimulates nerves behind the ear. They claim that these nerves send a signal to the hypothalamus, part of the brain that controls how the body store body fat. I'm very skeptical and in shock that the project already got so much funding. They don't show any people who were on the trail and didn't show any results except the founder showing his stomach. I feel like this is another scam, I'm just surprised how many people already pre-ordered something so ridiculous. It reminds me Ritot. How much of the claim is true? Can their clinical trials be found somewhere? They said they spent 5 years researching, it must be well documented.
