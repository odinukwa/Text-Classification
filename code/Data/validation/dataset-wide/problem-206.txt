I doubt that there is much which could top TechZen's answer, but a relevant theory which hasn't been touched on is Panspermia. EDIT: Missed post by DonyorM Panspermia: the theory that life on the earth originated from microorganisms or chemical precursors of life present in outer space and able to initiate life on reaching a suitable environment. Microscopic fungus has been shown to be able to survive and hibernate in the harsh conditions of space. Over a viable (extremely large) period of time, these fungal spores could traverse the enormous distance separating habitable/soon to be habitable worlds and enter before/after atmosphere formation to enter the primordial gene-pool of the planet. All life on earth has a large similar genetic base which could be transported with these spores and be implanted in the evolution of life on the other planet. This life would inherently be similar to life existing on earth. 

Fire is incredibly useful. As humans we've invented too many uses to count. However a few of the highlights include: climate control, cooking, sanitization, metalworking, protection, warfare, transportation and combustion engines. There are workarounds for some of these such as using electricity to cook, fuse metals together, or using radiation to sanitize. Not having fire means that if you want an advanced society you need to have a different path through history. The main reason is that early advancements like firing clay, basic copper and bronze tools, and the invention of better ceramics for transporting and preserving goods require heat. Without the ability to use fire, your society must use some other heat source. Cooking, metalworking, firing clay, and things of that nature don't require fire specifically, they require heat. It just happens to be that fire was the most readily available form of heat to humans. Another barrier to advanced civilizations is that to get the ability to automate things using computers, wiring, and even basic electricity you need a source of heat. Without it there's no way to reach advanced technology. However, all is not lost. Fire might be the simplest, cheapest, most readily available source of heat here on earth, but on a world of gas that would probably be chemical reactions. Exothermic chemical reactions release heat and there are lots of sources for them. Throwing combustion aside for now, neutralization is probably the easiest. This is the reaction that occurs between an acid and a base. Using strong acids and bases you can achieve a portable heat source all you have to do is mix them together and poof heat. Another workaround for creating a lot of heat (enough for metalworking and everything else) is a thermite reaction using iron oxide and aluminum you can get temperatures of up to 2500 °C (iron's melting point is 1538 °C). Thermite does require some heat to get it up to its reaction temperature but using other chemical reactions you could achieve this. 

You have portrayed your Lodge not only as the prevailing order, but as a house of peacekeepers whose purpose is in "helping the world and all its peoples". They also have free reign and hold no one sovereign to themselves. As to whether they are involved or passive with regards to external events you haven't made their nature apparent. To truly "control" (bad word) everyone and keep the peace everywhere they would also have to be everywhere. They do not bow to the rules of these places and seem to have the power to enforce their will even with resistance, which could of course be avoided with diplomatic lubrication. This can be resolved by having the equivalent of embassies in major locations for fast response time, a larger coverage and easier access to the state of affairs in many places. With this they should receive ample warning of impeding threat and could from these forward bases of operation dissuade or prevent altercations well in advance. By having an embassy everywhere they ensure a face of neutrality and can under this mask of neutrality target and deal with any single party which is a legitimate offender to "rules" without siding with that party's enemies. Their paring with otherworldly beings also differentiates them from their charges and passively separates them in a way that gives them further "superiority" and claim to declare oneself such a powerful peacekeeping entity. Should all these precautions fail and the hand is forced. The lodge would most likely seek a path that keeps closest to its ideals while still ensuring its survival. They have shown to be willing to take precarious, possibly risky decisions to achieve their ends. One would assume they could resort to drastic means. As to which "side" in an option of two. Most likely the one where they survive, if survival is more important than risking becoming something one doesn't wish to be. 

If for some reason a creature didn't need depth perception, or had some other means of perceiving depth then a cyclops doesn't seem impossible. If a large creature from the ocean transitioned to being a land creature and was able to continue using either echolocation (not too likely) or electroreception then a cyclops wouldn't be to far outside the realm of possibility. Another possibility is that the creature doesn't need sight, if it was more of an earthworm, or a mole like species and had only a single eye and has recently moved above ground. Yet another way this could have evolved is if the creature were largely stationary, depth perception wouldn't be as important to such a species of beings. 

Most answers here adequately address using potential energy to generate the force in ballistics such as catapults, or chemical energy from alchemic reactions. Here's something bordering reasonable doubt: If there was a need to have a range superiority over the "current warfare meta-tech" of catapults/alt-cannons, A modified-optimised version of Archimede's Death Ray could be used on one large ship or a well co-ordinated array of smaller vessels (opening up to interesting avenues of "burn-squad" crews or smaller team elements). Obvious time of day constraints aside, it would vastly overpower (and possibly catch by surprise) day-time ballistic warfare. 

Fish have your answer: the lateral line. Its a sensory organ that runs the length of the fish's body. The lateral line allows fish to sense movement and vibration in water. If you adapt this a small amount you could easily allow for it to work in very thick gasses. The cells on the lateral line have sometimes mutated to allow for electroreception, which is something you should really look into. Electroreception allows for electrocommunication and electrolocation. Which seem to be what you're looking for. 

One thing to note is that along with Shell Theorem comes dealing with all your concentric shells and final (remaining) earth sphere. You would have to come up with a way to prevent them from colliding with each other (for whatever of many reasons) since air won't dampen the inner movement nearly enough. Such a collision could lead to mass destruction. If you could somehow stabilize your world in some kind of pillar lattice, it would still be brittle (how large would your pillars have to be to hold planetary scale spheres and not crush themselves under their own weight, short of unobtainium). IMO you'd be better off increasing surface area by creating structures which both rise in altitude and extend subterraneanly. Think something along the effect of a heat-sink on a computer's CPU. The heat-sink optimizes on surface area contact with air. Excavate large areas of land to create valleys and mountains of large incline. Essentially medium-scale terraform parts of your planet to increase surface area. It would look akin to a spiky ball or super fine-fringed honey dipper. 

What you're describing seems closest to what D&D (and many other created worlds) refer to as sorcery which is a force that comes from within and is created by willpower (or in this case emotion). I would recommend looking at something like that. Sorcery might not be the correct name for your emotional magic however, as it sounds more like bewitchment or enchanting (the spells on people kind) because it feeds off emotions. You could even call it something as cliche as wizardry because that wouldn't necessarily box you into a corner and as you've already decided to create your own magic system wizardry (or similar) could be defined to mean anything you want. One final alternative would be to make up a word or series of words to represent this form of magic. Best of luck 

Let's give this a stab by starting to appeal to all the conspiracy theorists and consider the first possible time frame "Ground Zero". Along with the black suit syndrome, we don't know the unknown people (organisation X) who would be at G0 seconds before the projectiles (pod and ship) hit their likely calculated impact points (Let's say X has abundant resources and power to remain hidden from us common folk - be as creative as you need ie. able to intercept satellite/government/intelligence etc. to mislead their predictions of the orbital entry or crash). Case X - A: Assume that X somehow had prior knowledge of the existence of the newcomers. If relations were diplomatic -> a search/rescue/recovery and cleanup of evidence would take place (Lots of question about media footage with no answers still preferable to spilled beans). If relations were hostile (ship was possibly compromised by X to begin with) -> cleanup of survivors + evidence. Case X - B: X is just caught off guard like the rest of the world but they still want the information first, and if need be contained. They would likely undergo recon with risk assessment, capture/detain/eliminate hostile survivors. And attempt to clean up the scene. Entering slightly more realistic ground and say X doesn't exist or is otherwise occupied with more pressing concerns. Considering there was ample coverage and warning (uncompromised by X) of the craft's approach, countries or areas expecting the crash in their yard will likely have prepared a military/scientific/media resource at the site. Likely in that order. To first secure the situation and ensure the craft or its passengers pose no immediate aggressive threat. Followed by an investigation into the specifics of the craft/passengers/crash and the environmental threats they could pose. Concluded lastly by allowing/or not the media to disclose details of the event. As to what happens afterwards and who gets custody of the evidence, it's unlikely that a single government could cover up or lay claim to such an event (A claims crash site, B claims orbital entry into their skies, C claims debris, D claims death of civilians... etc.). I suspect a panel/convention/union of countries would be formed with regards to which decisions will be taken. Most likely these decisions will lead to scientific investigation for the most of the foreseeable future. Information released would most likely be that deemed safe enough to release to the public, or that necessary to control and keep the public calm. On a global scale there could be religious turmoil or similar such which would claim to explain the existence of the ship. 

If a non-physical answer is acceptable, then I think you could use religion and ideology as a way of keeping the populace on the ground. From your description this isn't what you're looking for, mostly because the civilisation you have seems very advanced (they're investigating space flight). However, if this religion was fairly new, say it arose with the advent of modern technology, then it could provide a reason for not ever building spaceships in the first place. That said, I think the best bet for a physical limitation is one that's already been proposed: a very stormy planet. 

Without re-iterating what a lot of people have said from a maths and physics perspective, the zombies will conform to local maxima. That being said, there are loud dynamic moving sounds factors like thunderstorms/earthquakes which behave as catalysts to "joining" two local maxima as a result of expressible/model-able random functions. Given sufficient time, storms could run all the necessary paths to "herd" all the local maxima together.
