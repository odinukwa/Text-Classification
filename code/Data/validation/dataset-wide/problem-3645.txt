The best advice I can give you for strength, joint integrity and injury prevention is very simple. #1 Train in different rep ranges. One day work in the 1-6 range, next day 6-10 and the next 10-15. Get strong in every rep range. This will ensure that your joints don't get beat up and it will improve your ability to recover from session to session. #2. Take a full week off every 6-8 weeks. If the idea of doing that makes you uncomfortable, then at the bare minimum have a de-load week where you drop the intensity and volume.Usually once a year for 3-4 weeks I do bodyweight only exercise at challenging angles. When I return back to using heavier loads, I find that I haven't any strength or size at all. I hope that helps. Mike 

I concur. Spot reducing is not possible. Typically fat comes off the last place you put it on. So if it has been sitting there for awhile, it may take awhile to get it off. Be patient. I would concentrate on making your training sessions (w/weights) a bit more challenging. Take shorter breaks (60 seconds) and up your volume a bit. Perform 4 or more sets per exercise and focus on compound lifts (squats, deadlifts, rows, presses, etc). If when you say 'run', you mean long distances for a greater duration than 30 minutes, I would cut back on that and start performing sprints instead. Hill sprints are great. Find a hill that is 30-40 yards, run up it as fast as you can, and then walk down and repeat when your heart rate has come down. Do that 7 or 8 times a session a couple of times a week and you will burn a ton of fat. Avoid the steady state long drawn out jogging. That will eat away at your muscle and do very little for fat burning. Hope that helps, Mike 

I think it really depends on the results you're getting.You need to monitor your body daily. If you find that you are adding excess fat/adipose tissue, then you probably only need the excess calories (ie. weight gainer) on the days you train. I don't see the sense in adding extra calories if you are not going to use them. I tend to add extra carbs/calories on the days that I train (especially post workout) and then I cut them back on my off days and stick to proteins,fats, vegetables and berries. Now if you are very lean and underweight, that is a different story. Then you can be more liberal and use the product more often. One caveat, don't forget the importance of real food. Real food will be your biggest ally above all else. The other variable you need to take into consideration is that these companies want you to finish off their products as quickly as possible so you will buy more. So take what you are reading with a grain of salt. I hope that helps, Mike 

Focus on performing a dynamic warm up first. It is involves activating the working muscles and taking them through a full range of motion. Running with high knees, jumping jacks, mountain climbers, duck unders. These are a lot more effective than static stretching. 

Make sure your hydration and electrolytes are sufficient before any race. Are you calves strong ? Do you train them ? 

I am sure the size of your legs is a combination of genetics and hypertrophy from the exercise you have participated in. I agree with the taking in less calories. You will lose weight, but there is no guarantee where the weight will come off. I would working getting leaner overall through exercise and diet, but at the same time learn to accept your legs as they are. Easier said than done I know. 

If your carbohydrate intake is too low, your glycogen levels within your skeletal muscle could very well be depleted to the point where your protein stores (muscle) is being used for fuel. Even in a calorie deficit, you need some carbohydrates to fuel your activities. It is a real balancing act. 

Target heart rate is overrated. I prefer rate of perceived exertion. If 10 is running for your life, you want to work in the 8 to 9 range for 10-30 seconds followed by 20-40 of rest and repeat for 7 to 12 intervals. To answer your question, I would try and keep your heart rate in the 85%-90% range during the 'work' segments. That will deliver the best results in terms of heart health and body composition. Mike 

Not true at all. The protein you get from nuts are great. The only drawback is that nuts are an incomplete protein meaning that they do not contain all the essential amino acids. All you need to do is combine nuts with a grain of some sort (whole grain bread, rice, etc) and you will get the missing amino acids you are looking for. The truth is, you probably get the missing amino acids from other foods that you have eaten throughout the day that are still floating around in your system. Hope that helps, Mike 

Laura, I saw that you mentioned sleeping on your side with a pillow. That is a great start. Whatever you do, never ever sleep on your front. It puts a tremendous amount of stress on your discs. In terms of exercises. I would start performing bird dogs, front and side planks. They are your best bet. I have videos of all of them on my website. Go to my home page and the link is there. I describe and perform them and it is easy to follow. You also want to look at strengthening your posterior chain. Hamstrings and glutes. Lying glute hip bridges and single leg glute hip raises are great for that. Quite often when we experience back pain it is because our other muscles aren't doing their jobs, so the lower back has to pick up the slack. Work on stretching out your glutes, hip flexors and hamstrings religiously. Morning and night. There are plenty of youtube videos you can find for that. I hope that helps, Mike 

Either or my friend. Makes no difference. The cholesterol in eggs will cause you zero harm. This is a myth. In fact, it will likely help you. Read this article. Why Egg Yolks Are Good For You: The Perfect Protein Source by Poliquin™ Editorial Staff 11/5/2013 12:16:49 PM Eggs are the perfect source of protein. They score highest on four scientific scales for protein quality! Not only do they provide an abundance of easily digested amino acids, eggs are packed with vitamins and nutrients that improve brain health and aid in fat loss. For example, choline, which is supplied in the egg yolk, is essential for brain function because it is needed for the body to make a critical neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. In addition, choline helps the liver to detoxify and avoid accumulating fat, which is essential for optimal liver function. Eggs also contain other nutrients such as the B vitamins, and two nutrients that may help prevent cancer: lutein and zeaxanthin. Meanwhile, research shows there is no link between eating whole eggs and elevated cholesterol. In fact, if you eat as much as three eggs a day on a carbohydrate-restricted diet, you may decrease inflammation and improve cholesterol markers. That’s what happened to a group of men who had only 18 percent of their diet from carbs but ate fat liberally, including three eggs daily for 12 weeks. The men also lost 5 kg over the course of the study. Take away the understanding that eggs are an excellent protein source that can be included in a low-carb, high-protein diet for optimal body composition and health. The key is to restrict carbohydrates, eat high-quality whole protein, and avoid processed or isolated fats. Reference Ratliff, J., et al.

Poor insulin sensitivity, obesity, diabetes. I would use oatmeal and sweet potatoes if you want to get your calories up. Those foods are much better at keeping your blood sugar balanced. 

Get a DEXA reading. They cost a lot, but they are the gold standard. There are gyms, rehab clinics, colleges and universities that can provide them. 

A lot of it depends on how much volume you are performing and how much you are lifting (intensity). Not knowing that, it is hard to comment. I have performed 10 sets of 10 reps on a squat protocol and it will take me 5 days to recover. Where as I can perform 3 sets of 12 reps on a split squat on a Monday and I am ready to go again 48 hours later on the Wednesday. Eric mentioned above about sleep, existing illness, resting hormone levels ,protein intake, training age, etc. Those will have an effect on your ability to recover. They can't be ignored. I would like to see what a typical training session looks like for you, then I would be able to give you a more accurate answer. Hope that helps, Mike 

Maybe your blood sugar was a bit off before you started. Try having a small snack an hour before you run and make sure you are sufficiently hydrated beforehand. I doubt it is anything serious, but if it persists, talk to your doctor. 

I would stretch them out first and try to increase your flexibility. Maybe you are not recovering from your workouts sufficiently. Not knowing you, it is hard to hypothesize, but those are the only issues I can think of outside of an existing injury. 

Not specifically. A wide grip pull up would be the 'balancing movement' of an overhead press. If you want to take care of your shoulders, I would look into doing some band pull aparts and some face pulls with a rope at the beginning of your workout. Especially if you are planning on doing some heavy pressing movements (bench, overhead, dips, etc) Hope that helps, Mike 

I wouldn't put too much emphasis on the heart rate zones and calorie numbers. The general rule of thumb for fat loss is the two extremes. Walking and sprinting. Joggingis the middle ground and it can get you in trouble if you do too much of it (eg. overproduction of cortisol, fat storing hormone). The daily walking you are doing sounds great for your goals. I would start mixing in some high intensity intervals at the end of your strength training sessions or on opposite days, time permitting of course. You can sprint, do bodyweight exercises. The mode really doesn't matter. Find something intense you can do for 20 to 30 seconds maximum and then give yourself a minute to recover and repeat 7 or 8 times. The calories you are burning while you are doing the actual work aren't really all that important. It is the intensity that counts. The harder you work, the more calories you are going to burn in the post exercise period and that is where the real fat loss occurs. Google 'EPOC'. There are lots of great articles on it Try not to get caught up in the overthinking. I have been there. It is counterproductive. Hope that helps, Mike 

I herniated a disc ten years ago and it changed my life. In the long run for the better. I was 6'4 250 lbs with a bodyfat percentage well north of 20%. I was not healthy. I was playing a lot of baseball and the combination of the excess pressure on my midsection from being overweight and the wear and tear from excess rotation (swinging) was something my discs could no longer handle. It forced me change my diet, train smarter and work on my flexibility. The fitness industry preaches to work on your core all the time, but it is the posterior chain that will save your back. I know this from experience. I spent a ton of time building up my abs and losing weight and never once thought about the muscles I could not see. After a year of suffering I enlisted the help of a physiotherapist and he pointed out that I had a flat butt, underdeveloped hamstrings and huge thighs. My body was far from symmetrical. So I went to work on these muscles and after only a couple of months my pain began to subside. Today I still have to watch what I do, but it is only intermittent discomfort from time to time. I would recommend that you start exercising, If it hurts, then back off, but stay active. Focus on the things that you can do and don't worry about the things you can't. I may never be able to deadlift again, but life goes on. I can still train, golf and play baseball once a week. In terms of sports, try swimming. It is a great total body workout, easy on the joints and I have found that it stretches my entire body out. I highly recommend it. Good Luck 

Find angles and exercises that don't cause the pain to recreate itself. Experiment with different exercises. If it hurts, don't do it. Ice your shoulder down post workout to avoid any flare ups. Along with your rotator cuff exercises, I would start with a thorough warm up. Begin doing shoulder dislocations against a wall, band pull a parts to retract your shoulder blades and spend a lot of time stretching out your pectorals. When the chest gets tight it causes your shoulders to roll forward (internal rotation) putting excess stress on the anterior deltoids. Once you get back to health, continue to balance out your overhead pressing with your bench pressing at a 1:1 ratio. Make a point of spending more time on the muscles you can't see (back in your case) and less on the ones that you can. I always perform pulling exercises at a 2:1 ratio vs. my pushing exercises. Hope that helps. Mike 

Sounds like a muscle spasm. It is caused by dehydration, mineral depletion and/or electrolyte abnormalities. They typically subside on their own. If not, go see a doc. 

I think it is a great idea as long as you can recover from day to day. Your fast twitch muscle fibers are getting a lot of work in. You really have monitor how you feel and whether or not you are getting stronger. If you are not either adding weight to the bar or reps to each set, then you are likely overtraining. I am of the opinion that as long as volume and intensity are added gradually, the body can adapt quite well. Take a look at construction workers, movers, manual labourers, they lift heavy shit everyday and are some of the strongest, fittest guys you will see. Their bodies have clearly adapted to the stresses placed upon them. Hope that helps, Mike 

Increased cortisol (stress hormone). Elevated heart rate throughout the day. Decreased immune system functioning makes you more susceptible to injury and illness. Decreased metabolic rate. To get into a truly 'overtrained' state is quite hard to do. Make sure you are getting adequate calories and adequate rest if you are going to train that hard long term. And g et the carbs up. Your body needs them.
