Obviously, I can't just buy it, push the button and expect a helicopter to show up. Are there monthly or registration fees? Do I need to get a permit or register with someone? How does it all work? Does it get service everywhere (even internationally)? I'm not even sure what I don't know at this point. Basically, if you were telling a friend how to purchase a PLB, what would you tell them? 

This is why those are the areas that naturally grow the most hair on human bodies. It's an evolutionary adaption to keep us warm. In those areas, there is a lot of blood flowing and it passes very close to the outer layer of skin, allowing it to cool of more rapidly and lower our body's temperature. It's all of the blood rushing around your skull, into your legs, or into your arms, respectively. Covering your head is a no brainer. As others have mentioned and most people already know, the head it where you lose most of your body heat, so wearing a dry, windproof hat with a lot of loft is always a smart idea if you're cold. The groin and the armpits are a bit more tricky. If you're dressed according to normal human social standards, you'll probably be fine. But if, for some reason, you're out in the cold with little or no clothing, those are the areas to focus on the most. Keep your arms tight at your sides and cover your groin with your hands. Not only is that our natural reaction to the whole "being naked" thing, it also happens to be the best way to stay warm with no clothes on! 

*According to numbers a 6mm static cord can hold 1600 lbs however I would not recommend using it for the purpose of ascending, let's keep it for hoisting the bear barrels into the trees. If you attempt to ascend a rope using only friction knots please use a safety back up such as the system detailed below! As a safety precaution tie off the slack end of the rope, using a figure eight on a bite, at progressive intervals and clip to your harness. To avoid having a clutter of these knots all hanging off your harness you might choose to untie and release each previous one. Note, however, some climbers prefer the clutter to potentially getting the trailing rope snagged far below. 

I have never re-soled a pair myself however one day I would like to give it a try just for fun. If you really want to give it a try why not, but remember to take your time and don't get frustrated! However, if you're hoping to have a shoe that's like new with a perfect edge and don't own any other pairs I would send this pair off to the professioanl and try next time... 

The bottom line is there is always SOME risk. Whether to take that risk or not is your choice. Fast running + isolated + high elevation = prettttty low risk. With that said the biggest concern is, unless you are drinking right from the source, you have no idea what has happened upstream from you. There could be a dead animal snagged in the stream, animal and human feces etc... I have drank from mountain streams and not gotten sick, but I have seen others partake and get real sick...The choice is yours. 

There will be different approaches depending on how much you are "in charge" of the group. Also, I understand the setting is that the group is already on the trip, possibly with limited possibility to extend or alter food supplies. (If you are just preparing for the trip, then the situation is easier, of course.) If you are on the trip, and intend to share meals prepared by group members in the open, out of supplies you brought with you, then the situation is quite simple. Make a list of all supplies you have or can get hold of. Then involve the group in menu-making, the fussy eaters in particular. Make your point clear: out of this stuff, what do you suggest we cook for the next few mornings/nights? In a group of equals (in terms of responsibility for the outcome of the trip), such as a group of friends, I would not go beyond this basic sharing of responsibility. If you are in charge (of a group of kids, or of your clients on a tour), you've assumed responsibility for them, but your situation might be alleviated by a previous contract (of whatever degree of formality) with them or their parents: if you said earlier that such and such food will be served at such and such intervals, then you simply proceed as planned. If your charges are so picky that they are unable to sustain their strength for the tour, you can try preparing meals that consist of two or more different courses or parts (such as, steamed ham and pea mash). Then you offer each person to partake of either or both, and help themselves to bread as accompaniment. Do not give any "substitutes" to those who do not opt for either of your courses. (Consider occasionally giving a small dessert to those who do, if they are kids.) Further, if they are kids in your charge, drinks can help in terms of giving some extra kick for the day and also creating team spirit. On a cold morning, hot cocoa or ginger tea with honey can work wonders. 

The chemical coating on the outside when new is what is commonly known as DWR and chemically known as a Fluoropolymer. Fluoropolymer is a fluorocarbon based polymer with multiple strong carbonâ€“fluorine bonds. It is characterized by a high resistance to solvents, acids, and bases. This is the same chemical treatment used on all water resistant fabrics. Gore-Tex uses this coating to prevent the outer layer of fabric from becoming saturated with water. This saturation, called 'wetting out,' can reduce the garment's breathability (moisture transport through the breathable membrane) and let water through. As the DWR wears off over time, re-treatment is recommended when necessary. 

Use the Overbag when it's too warm for your down bag Use the down bag at and around -15C Use the Overbag and Down Bag together when it's colder than -15C 

It is used to store the sleeping bag, in order to retain the loft. It is not a good idea to store your sleeping bag compressed as small as possible as this will damage the fill. This is very important with down, a little less with synthetic but overall it is crucial to the life of the sleeping bag. A couple things to remember are you want to ensure the bag is dry before storage and it will be stored in a dry area free of excess condensation. You also want to randomly toss it about in the larger storage bag as opposed to rolling it then storing. Rolling up your new sleeping bag will create creases in the same spot over and over and your bag will develop cold spots where the insulation separates as a result of these creases. The most ideal storage is fully laid out and hung, however manufacturers provide a breathable bag of what they have deemed is an adequate size to store the sleeping bag in.
