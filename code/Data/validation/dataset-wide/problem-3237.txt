German troops fighting in Russia must have been aware of the destruction of their cities back home by American and British bombing. Knowing that their loved ones were in danger and that their beautiful towns and cities were being destroyed, how did German soldiers react on the Eastern Front? Did it help fuel their fighting spirit, spurring on their efforts against the enemy they could reach (Russian ground troops) in lieu of the distant enemy (British and American air crew)? Or did it sap morale, with troops in Rostov and Riga questioning their purpose fighting so far from home when Germany itself was under such heavy attack? Is there evidence of either effect in letters and journals? 

In the recent World Service series The War That Changed The World the episode dealing with India contains a rather extraordinary claim. A panel member, an Indian, says there was a notion during WW1 that India might get her "own" colony in German East Africa as a prize for her substantial contribution of troops and money to the British war effort. Perhaps not so extraordinary, Several British Empire dominions did receive their own colonies or mandates. Australia, South Africa and New Zealand helped carve up Germany's colonial possessions. The notion that India could gain her own overseas empire ... were there any serious proposals? 

Most military histories of the war in North Africa, and especially those produced from a British point-of-view, emphasise the greenness of the American troops which landed there in 1942. There is a tendency to compare them unfavourably with the battle-hardened Germans (and British) who'd already been fighting for three years. The Americans had a lot to learn in 1942 (though everyone agrees they did learn quickly). Yet those same histories will also suggest one of the keys to the British finally defeating Rommel in Egypt and Libya in late 1942 was the arrival of large quantities of the excellent American Grant and Sherman tanks. British tanks like the Valentines and Mathildas used in the region between 1940 and 1942 don't seem to have been anything like as good. So my question is, how was the United States able to produce such good designs and such well built tanks so early in the war (early from a US point of view)? Without experience of war and with an isolationist mentality up until 1941 where had these excellent tank designs sprung from? Why weren't their tank designs as green as their troops? 

You (or your history professors) are overly concerned with the sexual orientation and/or criminal tendencies of the SA leadership. And you make the curious assumption (or seem to) that homosexuals and paedophiles aren't to be found in the aristocracy. Yes, the German Army, with its aristocratic leadership, wanted the SA neutered. But only because it was perceived as dangerous, anarchic and representative of the socialist wing of National Socialism. It had millions of members and was a dangerous rival to the army. The rest of the German establishment (banks, big business) felt the same way. Once rid of the SA, Hitler and National Socialism became much more acceptable to the Army and Big Business. Which is what Hitler intended. Anything to do with sexual orientation was window dressing. 

Following the Warsaw Pact's 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia the lead Czech reformer Alexander Dubƒçek was dismissed and given a lowly job with the forestry commission. A decade or so earlier, the similarly reform minded government in Hungary in 1956 was treated much more harshly. Imre Nagy and his colleagues were secretly tried and executed. While it might seem absurd to think of Brezhnev's USSR developing a humanitarian sensibility, everything is relative. Had Moscow by 1968 evolved a notion that executing high ranking political opponents was brutal, Stalinist, counter-productive and damaging in the eyes of world opinion? Or is there an entirely different explanation? Were there important political and military differences between the cases of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968? 

Reading Antony Beevor's "The Second World War" he makes the point several times that a peculiar obsession of Hitler's was the defence of Norway and that there were close to half a million German troops kept fairly idle in the region right up to the German surrender in May 1945. He also writes that partisan activity in Norway was minor compared to most of the other occupied territories. Bearing in mind that - assuming you weren't a fanatical nazi - service elsewhere in the German army from 1942/3 onwards was grim, involving heavy losses, constant instructions to hold hopeless positions and fight to the last man, and with no prospect of anything but certain defeat, was Norway the perfect posting? Was this generally (if quietly) acknowledged and is there any evidence that well connected families were able to have their sons posted to Norway? Edit: Since posting this I've seen Beevor lecture. He mentioned interviewing at least two wealthy Prussian aristocrats, in old age, for his book about Stalingrad. One of them ran into one of his former tenants in Stalingrad (the tenant says "I used to see you driving past in your Mercedes"). Both peasant and aristrocrat at this point were reduced to ransacking bodies in the mortuary for scraps of food. Clearly, anecdotally, some of the Prussian nobility, either as a point of honour or because it was unavoidable, were sending their sons to the very worst of the fighting. 

In Anne Applebaum's recent book Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944-1956 she claims the USSR supported the new state of Israel and states "Stalin believed Israel would quickly join the communist camp". She doesn't cite any references for this, but is it true? And if so, what grounds were there for Stalin believing Israel would align itself with the Soviet Union? 

To find out whether this order was carried out I checked Too Little, Too Late: An Analysis of Hitler's Failure in August 1942 to Damage Soviet Oil Production by Dr Joel Hayward. This resource suggests that bombing Baku never really took place, not so much because the Luftwaffe couldn't get close enough but because Hitler couldn't (or wouldn't) spare the necessary planes from other operations on the Russian front. 

There are two really substantial islands off the coast of China, namely Taiwan (Formosa) and Hainan. Whereas Taiwan has been occupied, colonised, renamed and fought over for the last 600 years, Hainan gets hardly a footnote in most histories. 

As to whether eastern parts of Germany were more backward anyway, and innately more pro-communist, then straightforwardly the answer would be no. I'm reminded of the quote, sorry I can't find the source, about communism being so terrible a system even the Germans can't make a success of it. 

In 1938 Chiang Kai-Shek's nationalist opted to breach the dykes of the Yellow River to flood the area in front of the Japanese advance and thereby slow down their enemy and protect the the key city of Wuhan. The loss of life in the flooding was terrible, as was the damage done to homes and agricultural production. The government knew very well that this would be the result; it was an act of desperation. The Chinese government didn't publicly admit to deliberately breaching the dykes. But the American government (at least) were well aware of how it had happened. Was the dyke breaching intended partly as a message to the Americans and overseas allies (and to Japan) that China was prepared to stay the course of the war, would pay any price, and would never submit to her enemies' terms? Something like Britain's sinking of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir? Is there evidence Chiang and his group intended the flooding to act as a message? 

I've marked in bold where nation states were recognisably exercising full sovereignty over the area. Looser claims in italics. Memelland (now Klaipeda) in Lithuania is another possible candidate. 

Tyler Durden's answer is excellent. But you request autobiographical evidence from Germans writing during the war. One German of note is the diarist Victor Klemperer. As a highly educated Jewish professor Klemperer was very far from representative of the general German population. However it is telling that his information (and he, understandably, took a keen interest in all such news) about the fate of fellow Jews was patchy. He writes about "evacuations" to the east and about work camps, rather than death camps. He well knew that the camps would be terrible places for even home in Germany his life was reduced to humiliating work duties, poor food and other privations. Certainly there were rumours of shootings, but his diaries suggest that rumours of all kinds were in circulation, some more and some less believable. In 1942 he mentions hearing about a "dreadful" camp at Auschwitz. But even Klemperer writing after the war is astonished to learn that Jews had been systematically killed in their millions. Klemperer's wartimes diaries come in two volumes: I Will Bear Witness and To The Bitter End.
