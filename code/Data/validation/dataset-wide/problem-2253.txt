I'll offer up my experiences. I spent a summer in the Sea of Cortez, in which the night time lows didn't go under 100f and the sea water temperature was above 90f for months. It was around 20 degrees latitude, and was extremely hot. In pure sun like that, you need to keep the sun off of your skin, period. You will be hot no matter what you do. There's no way to walk around in 125f heat and not feel intense heat, but you can do your best to keep from being physically harmed from it. Hat: In the tropics, the sun is typically at a very high angle so broad hats will cover your shoulders. Umbrellas work too. Shirt: Long sleeve. I use ExOfficio's Sol Cool line with great success. Pants: Typically in disgustingly hot heat there are disgustingly nasty bugs to match so as much as it stinks you need to wear long pants. Thin synthetics work good. I like Prana pants. You can roll them up to your knees. Also, this keeps the sun off your skin (rolled down). Shoes: Sneakers with a lot of mesh. Cheap ones might melt (seriously), but given the ground heat and bugs you can't really play around with flipflops if you're in the back country. Umbrella. It might sound very un-outdoorsy, but I'm a convert for the silver-lined go-lite clone umbrellas (ultralite trekking models). They keep a tremendous amount of heat off of you, and you can take your hat off to cool down more. I use one any time backpacking in the summer with direct sun (no trees). Other things to consider are skin rashes, infections, heat cramps, and other super fun heat related issues. Until you've lived in the tropics (without AC) for a couple of years, it's really hard to fathom exactly how brutal the sun is. We started nicknaming it "The Orb of Death". If you're only hanging out for a few days in the desert at 35 degrees latitude, some of this is no big deal. But if you're in the real tropics mid summer, this stuff really can kill you. 

It depends a lot on the terrain. I wear a pedometer throughout the week (health program for work), and I use a GPS when hiking. From experience - on level terrain - I know that I get between 2100 and 2200 steps per mile. I walk between work and the coffee shop (a round trip of about 1.25 miles) each day, and this is fairly consistent. If you calibrate your pedometer to your stride on level ground (such as a road or sidewalk), it will not be accurate when your environment changes. Likewise, your stride will be different when you are going uphill vs downhill. When I go hiking, though, this changes. My stride tends to be longer on downhill sections of trail, shorter on uphill sections. Even more noticeable, when I am on rough, rocky trails, my steps can increase by as much as 50%. This variation is enough to make the pedometer useless for measuring distance while hiking. You have to be careful with distance measured by GPS as well. In many cases, such as when you're moving consistently, it's quite accurate. Realize, though, that when you're sitting still, the jitter (noise resulting in inaccuracy) in the signal adds to the distance tracked. Just last weekend, I racked up 0.1 miles while sitting still for three or four minutes. Don't believe me? Open up your GPX track file on a computer and zoom in -- I guarantee you'll be able to spot the locations where you take breaks along the trail! ;) I have found that I can more accurately measure hiking distance by time rather than paces. My pace tends to be about 2.8 mph with a medium-sized pack. 10 miles equates to just a little under four hours (3:45?) of walking. 

So, I recently posted a question on hiking with a baby - my wife and I used to hike a fair amount, and we would like to get cracking again soon, but with our 7-month daughter. I'm currently trying to get as much info and as many do's and don'ts as possible, so today's topic: we use disposable diapers currently, and it suddenly occurred to me that our little bundle of joy is a regular production line of soiled diapers, and we would obviously need to carry them out with us. But they can get quite heavy (by the way, I'm a small guy, so I care about weight. A lot.) Many trails have proper waste bins at each hut, but we often hike trails without huts, by preference. So, any experience with this? Any suggestions? (I'm also very aware of the ecological impact of using the things at all, but that's a debate for another day...) 

My experience tells me it is primarily about keeping the sun off my skin, with a hat (not your question I know), and a long sleeve, synthetic, wicking running/cycling shirt, and one with a small collar. (For what it's worth, I've also worn long baggy pants at times for the same reason, but am unsure about this still.) The first little while is actually quite uncomfortable because I'm very aware of having the fabric against my skin, but that also seems to promote the sweating, so very quickly I cool down after that. In fact, if the sun drops and I started getting too cool, I roll UP my sleeves :) I live in South Africa, which is pretty hot, and the trails in the area I most often hike in have very little shade, if any. Hence the importance of sun-protection first. Hiking bare-chested is a big no-no (even though some fellow hikers feel cooler; I often wonder if this is somewhat psychosomatic, however) 

I'll second the earlier nomination of the "ten essentials" list (@Nate Eldredge). There are two versions of this list, with the classic version of the list tracing its roots back to the 1930's. These lists are presented convenently on REI's web site ($URL$ but I will reproduce them below for posterity. One bit of wisdom often not given in association with these lists is "...and the knowledge to use them properly". Without knowledge, these items are little more than additional pack weight. If you are going into any sort of a remote area, get proper training in navigation, first aid, and basic survival skills. For anything much more than a short outing at a local park, I will pack enough for an overnight including all of the items on the modern version of the list. Understand that this would NOT be a comfortable overnight, but I would be protected from the forecast weather conditions and have sufficient food and water. This typically weighs in at 12-14 lbs (and this is where the ultralight backpackers get to chuckle...). Updated Ten Essential "Systems" 

While I agree with the above comments, one thing worth noting is that, like all "luggage", there is a certain element of "stuffability" possible in a backpack, which would not be possible in a bin liner, at least not easily. You can really jam all the softer things into a backpack (like clothes, sleeping bag and liner, etc), and then cinch it tight afterwards (a good thing of course :)) - attempting the same in a bin liner might just tear it, or worse, stretch it, therefore not giving you any sort of useful indication. So my gut feel is that unless you have any particularly large or weirdly-shaped items, it is probably an ok way to get a rough estimate. Once you have a backpack, you will always pack to that size anyway: I always manage to fill the darn thing up to capacity, whether its a 1-nighter or 3-nighter :( As a side note, I tend to pack my clothing in a cheap bin liner first anyway, and then suck all the air out: its amazing how small and compact you can make it, and of course it is mostly waterproof afterwards too...
