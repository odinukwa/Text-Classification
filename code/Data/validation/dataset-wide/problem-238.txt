The blimp would have no buoyancy on Mars. Mars atmosphere would make a good attempt at a hard vacuum, at less than 1% the density of earth's. A blimp and a rock would have nearly the same flying ability. 

Yes it is possible. Take Italy, which is named in the Bible (Acts 27). There are 20,000 unpopulated ghost towns in a small heavily populated country that is over 2,000 years old. Link: $URL$ 

Yes. If they know how to make gunpowder, then the rest is pure mechanics. The hardest part is producing viable bullets. Lead casting is an ancient art, older than bronze, and achievable with a good hot camp fire. But other materials might work if not as well (dense hardwoods for example). After that, every gun enthusiast knows how to reload a cartridge. A longer term consideration is wear and tear on the barrel of the firearm. It's not such a big deal with a shotgun, but it will become a concern with a rifle. Rifling a barrel is something that very few people can do well even with modern tools (my father was one such). Using ammunition that does not fit the barrel as well as mass manufactured rounds will cause more rapid wear and tear, and the barrel will not be replaceable. 

Mythbusters had an episode where an Iado practitioner deflected a bullet with a katana (can't find it now, they expected a fail and were surprised). I can't find that episode right now, but the real issue was the timing, not the energy of deflection. He had to be an exact distance from the muzzle and in control the firing. The theoretical cyborg would need better reflexes and shorter decision time, since it would not be a staged event. 

Humans eventually decided that they would stop throwing missiles around and would stick to things that were a little bit less effective. Of course, you're in a fantasy setting (I presume), so things are a bit different... 

The Spring has around for as long as anyone in the kingdom can remember. In fact, even the records of the Blind Folk tell of their explorers hearing the Spring when they emerged from the caves. It did not take long for the race of man to learn to draw from it. When a skilled wizard is tuned into the Spring, they can access tremendous power. It was within the power of a team of wizards to lift a vast city into the sky. But it was within the power of an individual to topple it. Quickly, the land that is now the kingdom became consumed by ceaseless war. Strong dark wizards used local rulers as puppets to wage war with each other, and the rest of mankind suffered. After thousands of years, humanity finally emerged from the darkness with only six hundred people left. These people founded a new kingdom from the ashes of the old one, and that kingdom stands to this day. Today, children are taught about the Spring in their history classes, and the lucky few who can hear it from birth might unwittingly draw from it from time to time. But nobody wants to deliberately use it for fear of what happened centuries ago. When the Kingdom was founded, millions of Spring-linked playing cards were manufactured and distributed all over it. These playing cards became the only common use of the Spring. The cards could be lethal, sure, but they had a very limited impact: a single full-length game would take hours and could only kill up to one person at a time. Soon people realized that, instead of armies wielding swords, they could wield cards. Card combat was cleanâ€”it caused no civilian casualties, spread no dangerous disease, and required no long treks through the wilderness to engage the enemy. By now, no state in the Kingdom has a "blood army," and nobody wants to try and create one for fear of an escalation. 

With a meteor of that scale, the least of your worries will be the EMP. The energy of impact will instantly vaporize the meteor itself and an equivalent mass of the earth's crust. The shockwave will be felt around the world as major earthquakes. Portions of the mantle may be exposed briefly, a large mass of sulfur will be vaporized. The heat of impact will cause fires across half the world. Molten rock fragments will rain from the sky around the world for days. In short, I feel no amount of concrete can protect you from the simple mechanical damage. Defense against EMP effects, in contrast, is simple. It requires a solid metal casing around the electrical and electronic systems. 

You don't want lead or other heavy shielding because the biggest danger in space is"particle" radiation, atoms moving at near light speed. When the particles hit heavy shielding they produce a ton of secondary radiation. However, PVC sheeting has shown promise in this application. See $URL$ . 

Well ... the typical particle accelerator is several miles across, and 180 MW energy $URL$ . The mechanical pressure of the particles inside is sufficiently low that standard photographic films and metal foils show no visible mechanical reaction to being struck by the particle stream. At a high level, the energy in the particle accelerator is expended in shattering atoms into their component parts, at a more detailed level, the bulk of the energy is expended in the cryogenics and support services to keep things running. Very little energy is expended on actualy accelerating particles. What makes ion drives attractive is the low mass and energy consumption and ability to function over a long time. A particle accelerator is high mass, high energy consumption, , and wasteful in terms of its ability to convert stored energy into kinetic energy.
