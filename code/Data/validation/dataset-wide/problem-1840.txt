I always run these commands from a terminal first to see what's going on instead of trying to debug them in Nagios. It's just easier and you can typically provide switches to the plugins that make them more verbose. I'll usually become the user, whatever that username is, when doing this. 

EDIT #2 OK so one issue appears to be with the extended attribute not being present on the mounted brick's filesystem. This command is suppose to fix that: 

By setting the xgid bit on the directory, you're forcing what ever group owns, said directory, to be propagated any time new files are created within it. This approach will only work for newly created files, it won't, for example, enforce the group ownership if someone were to move files into this directory from somewhere else on the system. However, given this is an SFTP server application, I can't think of any way a user would be able to move files into this directory, outside of SFTP. 

For md3 the sda4 device is #0. The sdb4 device is #2. So the U is for the sba4 device. For md2 the U is for device sda3, #2. So it would seem that you drive sdb is one one having the issues, since none of those partitions is listed as "UP" aka. "U". They'are all reported as "DOWN" aka. "_". 

Stupid question but this doesn't work, seems like it should. Is there a trick to access a booting Guest VM's bootmenu using ? I'm running the VM using 0.8.7. server is a CentOS 6.3 box running . Guest is Windows 2008R2. I added this to the Guest VM's XML: 

We've been using KVM for 6+ months and haven't had any problems. I've used other virtualization technologies such as OpenVZ, VMware, and Virtualbox. 

I would also check out the Apache error and access logs files, most linuxes store these under , possibly . They're usually 2 files, and . Regarding the error you're getting on startup, sounds like you need to set the variable in your file. 

I've been using virt-manager on my Fedora laptop to connect to a headless CentOS 5.X server running KVM (libvirt). virt-manager can remotely connect to other computers that are running KVM. Look under the File pull-down in virt-manager, where it says "add connection". Check the box that says "Connect to remote host". There are several choices as far as protocols go for connecting to a remote system. In my version of virt-manager (0..8.7) I have the following: 

NOTE: That last bit is to handle the case where you run the above multiple times against the same servers. This will eliminate your pubkey from getting appended multiple times. Notice the single ticks! Also pay special attention to the fact that all these commands are nested inside of single quotes. That's important, since we don't want to get evaluated until after it's executing on the remote server. 

After the poll function above either times out or receives a packet moves on to the "next" interface: 

How are you confirm what headers are being sent when you access the / URL? Can you try this curl command? Something similar to this but with your URL: 

Background I have the following Nginx configuration which is load balancing 2 Tomcat servers running on 2 different servers: 

Notice that the entire contains a loop. So what does this all mean? I would say that if you have a heavily trafficked network with a lot of hosts and your DHCP leases are relatively short, then you may want to consider running 2 instances of dchrelay. If however, your network is relatively small and your DHCP lease timeouts are relatively long, then running a single instance should be fine. Some additional things to consider 

You can check your system using the command . I'd run that to make sure your installation of (what provides ) and aren't broken from a previous update. Example 

If you have to have it in a terminal why not just use . I typically use the website: $URL$ for looking up man pages. You could set a bash function up like so: 

The key concept is to setup a share on the Samba server and then make use of the tab under the properties of a network installed printer. This would be a system that already has this printer setup.              Once the drivers have been installed they're show up automatically to any clients that make use of this CUPS printer. 

Confirming extended attributes You can use the following command to see what attributes are present: 

You can signal the Linux Kernel to drop various aspects of cached items by changing the numeric argument to the above command. NOTE: clean up memory of unnecessary things (Kernel 2.6.16 or newer). Always make sure to run sync first to flush useful things out to disk!!! 

You don't say but if you're using Apache you can use the mod_substitute module to accomplish this. Check out the Apache documentation and also this example. The steps will be roughly: 

Some distros provide a tool (it's really a shell script) called . I find using this gets around a lot of the headaches with copying the portion of a user's key to a remote account's file. Usage 

You can use these constructs to run and send you mail if it succeeds (echo true) or send you mail if it fails (echo false). 

This script also takes care of creating the user's directory on remotehost as well and set's the permissions up correctly. 

The MAC Address is the string after the word "ether", 00:0c:29:fd:f6:1d. You can see all the network devices with this command: 

The HDD I replaced is . I have it mounted (as seen above) and when I run I see that it's listed there: 

Here are a couple of websites that offer RAID calculators. I use these to get a rough idea of how much space I'll have with various RAID configurations. NOTE: Remember that this is the total space available after portions of it have been substracted out for use by the RAID. You'll still be losing more depending on which filesystem you lay on top of the RAID. 1. icc-usa RAID Calculator 

This is purely a permissions problem. The user "remoteuser" on "remoteserver" doesn't have permissions to write files to . See this error in your commands output: 

Add extended attribute - notice that it needs to be on the directory, I tried it a level up from there and it didn't work 

Here's an example that shows the directories in a more compact summarized form. It handles spaces in directory/filenames. 

Does anyone know of a way using KVM to find out the IP addresses of KVM guests that are using a bridge interface (br0) through the KVM host? Currently I have br0 setup with a single NIC (eth0) included. The KVM host is a system running CentOS 5.6 in case that matters. The guests are also running CentOS 5.6. BTW, the guests do not just show up in the KVM host's arp table, I'm looking for better solutions and/or leads. 

I maintain a single name server but have several sub-domains so I use the $ORIGIN trick mentioned in the O'Reilly DNS & Bind book referenced here. /var/named/chroot/var/named/data/db.192.168.1 

I realize you're looking for a GUI way to do this but you can get the MAC Address from the command line like so: 

With that many drives I would use RAID 60. With RAID 10 you're vulnerable in different ways depending on which drive(s) fail.    In this scenario if you lose the 2 disks that share a common block (D1, D2, etc.) you're hosed. For your situation given you have 16 drives you have basically 8 groups of disks. So you can lose 1 disk from each group and still be fine. If you lose 2 disks that are part of the same group (mirror) then you're out of luck. References 

So the are part of the Python language. If you search for them you'll eventually find this page from the Python language's specification, specifically this section titled: 5.6.2. String Formatting Operations. There is an example on this page: 

I've seen mentions that it's possible to change WebSphere 8.x so that it uses Oracle's JVM instead of IBM's included JVM. Does anyone know how to accomplish this? It does seem possible but I did not see a method mentioned anywhere that shows how to go about doing this. 

A co-worker ran into a issue with getty/multi-user systemd targets not starting. When he connected to the console there was a prompt that he had to acknowledge/answer a question so that things could proceed past which allowed for getty/multi-user to start. This is a screenshot from the prompt:        This issue is referenced here as well: “License not accepted” when CentOS 7 initiate. The EULA that you need to agree to can be automatically accepted via kickstart as described here - kickstart with eula - finish configuration. 

Ironically does not possess a method for performing a "dry-runbanaction` that's defined for a specific jail by overriding it for a given jail or do override the actions themselves. In newer versions of you can create overrides quite easily by making identically named files with the suffix instead of . You also have access to the and sub-directories where you can put overriding configuration files for a specific jail so that you can redefine values for variables that were previously set, such as . So say your or had this in it: 

You can read more about them here. NOTE: This method requires that you only want www.example.com/index.html to redirect to www.example.com/blog/. Method #2: Using an Apache rewrite 

These rules are doing the following. 1st is skipping if there isn't a . The 2nd saves the bit after the equal sign in a variable, . The last line, , builds up our new , /sections/%1, any time a /sections.php line is encountered, and had a , cid=.... A sample html file: 

The certificates are associated to a specific hostname. So if you try and access your site with just it's IP address the certificate won't match. You can use a service such as SSL Shopper's SSL Checker to see what hostname is associated with a given certificate. example              

The same switches around logging for sftp-server also work for internal-sftp. Here's an example from my /etc/ssh/sshd_config: 

The output from should be all 's aka. they're all "UP". For example here's my RAID1 array, with 2 members. 

Also it looks like a typo on the first line: I think it should just be , not . That's what the error is complaining about, line #1: 

If you look in the man page for the CLI tool there are some examples which show how to accomplish this, though not directly using the subcommand. man page 

The above is untested by me so I'm not sure if it will work for you or not. Also I can understand some of the confusion around this facility in . According to the PHP documentation it doesn't sound like the above is possible outside of the file. 

This seems to be an issue with apache2 on Ubuntu. I found several threads on other sites where the solution was to set ServerName to localhost. 

With the above setup I initially thought that I could only run the heal command from the primary node of the GlusterFS cluster, but as it turned out, my true issue lied in the fact that the 11 nodes within the GlusterFS cluster were running 2 different versions of GlusterFS. Once I realized this, I updated all the nodes to the latest version of GlusterFS (3.7.3) and was able to perform heals from any of the nodes, as one would expect. 

Strange I was trying to do the same thing today as well. I don't think it's currently supported in the version of KVM that's included with CentOS 6.x. 

Under the System pull down in Gnome, launch the Remote Desktop App, System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop. From here check the allow other users to view your desktop. Also set the security and notification sections accordingly. 

When you setup the database connection info for wordpress did you specify your computer LAN IP address or localhost (127.0.0.1)? Given everything is running on the same host I would suggest using localhost anywhere you might be specifying your LAN IP address. Also I would check to make sure that is listening on both localhost IP as well as your computers LAN IP. You can do this using . In the example above I'm listing out all the processes that are using a network connection. You're looking for processes that are listening on port 3306 (item #1 in my screenshot which is listening on port 80). The program that's associated with this port is item #2, TeamViewer in my example. Item #3 is the process ID of the running program, 1588. You want to make sure that for item #1 the IP address reads either 0.0.0.0, you LAN IP, or localhost. It may read a combination of those or all three. The important thing is that the program is listening on the IP address that you're using when you try and connect. 

One approach would be to override the settings using KVM. You can change a KVM VM using the command . To make these changes edit the virtual machine's XML file through virsh: 

As to how it works, the tells rsyslogd to discard any additional messages that matched the previously matched rules up to this point. To guarantee that this rule is picked up early on, you can change the name of the file from to . 

The above are meant to be run as root. If you're trying to do them using sudo then you'll need to change the syntax slightly to something like these: 

The ISP is going to be giving you a block of IP addresses. For example, the ISP might give you as your IP block. This allots you IPs. One for the network () one for the default route (most likely ) and broadcast IP address for the network () and actual IPs to use ( through ) for actual devices. Use this CIDR calculator to determine the network topology:                                    So out of the back of the ISPs modem you've probably got 3-4 ethernet ports. Plug 2 wires into the back of that and those 2 wires go into ports on the Watchguard box. Then you'll need to configure each of those ports for a specific IP from the ISP. They should be perhaps and . Using 2 additional ethernet ports on the Watchguard box setup 2 separate class C networks say and . One for the first tenant and the other for your customer. You'll need to make sure that the 2 networks have firewall rules disallowing each others subnets from being routable to each other as well. Comment if you need more info, this should get you started. 

In the connection dialog select VNC for the connection protocol and put either the remote servers name or ip address and click connect. 

In the screenshot below you can see that an Ubuntu box was detected and the MAC address had the manufacturer Cadmus computer Systems.               Example commands 

For starters you can designate each site with a particular port 8080, 8081, etc. and then use something like autossh to maintain the connections. Then you'd be connected and would just need to go from 8080 to 8081 check each site that you've mapped to a designed local port. This type of approach could be scaled up so that instead of you looking at each sites' local port, you could have a script do the checking instead. Depending on what's on each site' Icinga site, you could periodically check it with your own Nagios/Icinga site that's been configured to check for the various things you've been checking for manually. It's really hard to provide more info without more specifics.
