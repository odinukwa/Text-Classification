The actual success of physics is founded on these principles; the historical success is that the fact that these principles are simple enough to be easily mathematised, which lent them a weight of authority inherited from the apparent certainty of Euclid's work. The fact that they were easily mathematisable also allowed them to be easily verified in cases of interest, such as the orbits of moons and planets and the ability to calculate the tides. As these applications were surprising at the time, the success seemed remarkable and a standard to achieve in the future. It seems to me that the problem with mathematising biology is that it would be akin to studying number theory having only random samples of numbers on the order of 1024 or larger to deal from expressed as a string of 1s. Any two are going to seem different; the probability that you will notice that you've seen the same number before will diminish rapidly with the size of the number concerned; and relationships between them apart from relative size will not be easy to formulate. It would be difficult to find out about prime numbers, for example, if one could never reliably obtain the same number twice, let alone any number less than a trillion. So it is unsurprising that biology appears to lack (or if we take 'biology' to be the human activity of studying living systems and their components, actually does lack) so-called universal laws, because it is difficult to isolate anything whose behaviour is regular enough that it possibly could give rise to one — and it is also unclear that in a complex system, that the regular behaviour of such simple subsystems could be evident in the behaviour of the whole. Any such regularity (one might imagine the conservation of energy in the form of sunlight and chemical potential as an example) might simply be deferred to chemistry or physics. This is not to say that it is either necessary or fruitful to mathematise biology; only that it is not impossible in principle — and that the nature of the obstacle amounts to one of sheer computational complexity, as with the solutuon of the three-body gravitational problem. From the outside, biology seems to do quite a good job at tackling extremely complex phenomena using qualitative principles. It is not difficult to imagine that an accurate mathematisation of biology would either be so coarse or ad-hoc as to provide no special benefit over qualitative reasoning, or so complex as to be actually impossible for a human mind to grasp. If so, what benefit would be obtained through its mathematisation? As long as it is possible to formulate theories with enough precision (with or without mathematics) that one may discern whether or not it seems useful in practise (neither too vague nor too inaccurate), it is not a necessary feature of science that it be mathematical. Mathematics is merely one tool of ascertaining precision and accuracy, superlative though it may be; there is no reason to believe that it excludes the possibility of all other means of judging these qualities. 

or "I am Elvis Presley, and anyone who is Elvis Presley is none other than myself". If I wanted to say that there is one and only one Elvis Presley, without claiming that I am myself Elvis, I could write instead 

If you abandon the notion of choice, you must also abandon the notion of blame. If you disbelieve in choice, it is not clear what "blame" could mean, beyond mere attributing of causal agency. If someone kills a child because they had a brain tumour, which gives them voices in their head which they are compelled to obey, this does not change the fact that this quite disturbed person was the proximal cause of the death of the child. The killing of people — children especially — is socially prohibited (which is in one sense an understatement, but at the same time is precisely what is at issue when we speak of law). So we must raise the question of how to react to the killing. Much of what is socially unacceptable, is unacceptable because it is greatly disruptive to society. It is harder to maintain a stable society with a large murder rate, for example. It seems to me that we have agreed to laws in which murder has strong punishments, and to a society which is structured so that the chances of being prosecuted for murder is quite high if you perform the act, because we view the stability that such a society brings as a worth-while trade-off for this limitation on behaviour. Other prohibitions, such as theft, exist for similar reasons; and still other laws or social customs exist merely as conventions in order to put boundaries on the range of peoples behaviour — in order to make people more predictable, and interaction with other people more tractable as a result of that range of predictability. People who are for whatever reason inclined to violate these laws or conventions put themselves, to one extent or another, outside of the vaguely collective agreements of society. At the least, they may be a source of minor controversy, which can be good for a society; but in the case of someone who kills others in society, whether out of a sort of existentialist lust to realise their freedom of choice (as in Camus' The Stranger) or for medical reasons outside of their control, they are from a straightforwardly causative perspective a danger to society; and so we must react to maintain the stability, if we find the compromises of society preferable to its limitations. What differs, if you have a concept of "blame" or not, is how you react. If you have a concept of "blame", because you think that the tumour-suffering person could always have chosen not to kill anyone, then you punish them to satisfy your affronted sense of justice. But the very emotion of righteous indignation is likely to be an animal response, preferentially selected for the effect that it produces of preventing people from passively accepting whatever harm might befall them; it is a clumsy and inefficient judge of how best to react to achieve a more compassionate response. Better still would be to simply remove whatever caused the violent behaviour, and forego the inefficient decision procedure of deciding whether to "blame" them. Of course, this very thought process of medically removing the causes of violent behaviour is exactly what is portrayed in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, in the forms of electroshock therapy, medication, and finally lobotomization. This illustrates the importance — and the peril — of allowing a society to judge what is a sufficiently "disruptive" behaviour to require medical treatment, what is a reasonably likely medical cause for the behaviour, and what is a reasonable treatment for that behaviour. Any heavily simplified model for disruptive behaviour may be as oppressive, or more so, than the marginal behaviours that it was devised to treat. Given people's strong preference for very simple world-models — especially when they operate as part of a committee, and in the name of an abstract ideal such as "justice" or "morality" — this is a danger not to be neglected. 

Stoicfury's answer addresses the root issues of the Turing Test. Allow me to present a thought-experiment, however. What would be the ramifications of a world where, as in Asimov's writings, we have "robots" — intelligent electronic agents, whether or not they are equipped with a human-shaped chassis or remote peripheral, which must obey the three Laws of Robotics — and where we have Turing Tests? Something completely glossed over in Asimov's earlier writing is that the robots always knew who they had to obey. But a world in which you had a Turing Test is one where you can create robots who can effectively simulate the typical behaviour of people. This raises the question: how on Earth (or elsewhere) is a robot, on first inspection, supposed to determine whether or not anyone giving them an order is human, or another robot? In Asimov's books: 

Unique existence Finally, using the theory of definite descriptions, we can characterize unique existence using a combination of existential quantification, universal quantification, and equality. For instance, if E(x) = "x is Elvis Presley" and i = myself, I could render I am the one and only Elvis Presley by 

I've been considering the possible-worlds semantics for simple forms of modal logic, such as Kripke modal logic. This reading of modal logic seems to be a reduction to restricted truth-tables, where each row of the truth-table corresponds to the truth-assignment to propositions in (one or more) conceivable worlds; and the worlds which we deem possible are some subset of these rows. Consider a proposition A, and some selection W of possible worlds which corresponds to some particular rows of a truth-table. We also introduce a (trivial) modal notion of a conceivable world, which is more general than a "possible" world in that all rows of the truth table are considered to correspond to conceivable worlds; and let U correspond to the set of all concievable worlds, containing the actually possible worlds as a subset. The usual notion of the truth of A in some world w ∈ W (or w ∈ U) is then written v(A,w). In this reading of modal logic, □A means that in all admissible rows, A holds, i.e. 

We can see from the above that both P ⊃ Q and Q ⊃ P are true, if P and Q are either both true or both false — if P and Q are themselves equivalent. This is just the observation that P ≡ Q ("P is equivalent to Q") is logically equivalent to (P ⊃ Q) & (Q ⊃ P). But precisely because P ⊃ Q and Q ⊃ P are not logically equivalent, P ≡ Q is a stronger logical statement — a tougher constraint to satisfy — than either conditional alone. Note that because P ≡ Q is equivalent to (P ⊃ Q) & (Q ⊃ P), it is possible to summarize P ≡ Q as saying that "P is a necessary and sufficient condition for Q", where the 'necessity' comes from the conditional Q ⊃ P, and the 'sufficiency' comes from P ⊃ Q. Contrapositives The conditional statement P ⊃ Q does have another equivalent conditional form, known as the contrapositive: ¬Q ⊃ ¬P. This is a way of rephrasing the constraints on when P can be true, as a constraint on when Q can be false. 

To ask if something "already" exists, is expressing an anticipation. One imagines something: an object, an invention (that is, the realisation of an idea) or an idea itself (that is: a careful exposition or exploration of a concept). In each case the question is whether there is a feature of the world — the objects in it or the behaviour of people, up to and including ideas which are discussed by them — which corresponds to something one has thought of. To ask if something "already exists" is to ask something not about the world per se, but about the relationship between one's own ideas and the world. You have thought about X, and you want to know if X corresponds to something in the world beyond yourself. "Existence" is nothing more than what the world consists of, but in this case the emphasis is on the separation between the rest of the world and the processes going on in your head. "Existence" is therefore a deceptive property, because what it pertains to is not a relationship between an object and the world, but between yourself and the world.
