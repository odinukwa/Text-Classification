You can have free will without this meaning that you modify the flow of things. You can also consider that through free will we modify the world around us. An absolute determinism that encompasses actions of organisms is most probably wrong. But a determinism considering cause-effect relationships of matter seems right. We should also distinguish between the concept of destiny-fate and determinism. Determinism regards the situation of the world and its causal relationships, and destiny/fate usually refers to a person or group and presupposes a superior will. Free will is usually opposed to the concept of destiny. How to combine freedom and determination? It can be done as one aspect of freedom is the ability to determine things at will. And how the chain of causes and effects is affected by this? It can be said that we are determined to act as further determination agents. from wiki article free will: 

The term Ουσία derives from a form of the verb εἰμί - I am, but is a different word. οὐσία < from οὖσα - ἐοῦσα (ὤν < female participle of the present tense of the verb εἰμί - I am) Ουσία in Ancient Greek meant: a. Property, wealth, b. philosophical essence, substance c. chemical elements Εστί means to exist, 3rd person present tense of verb εἰμί / I am. Είναι -> infinitive present tense of verb εἰμί / I am being qua being -> όντως ον (ὤν < participle of the present tense of the verb εἰμί (I am) ) Τί ην είναι ~ being qua being ("essential being"), -> quidditas Τόδε τι -> ουσία/ "what is there in a thing" / basic characteristic /what is the essential component of a being, what is crucial component/property/attribute to differentiate one being from another and for a being to stay the same επιστήμη (science) -> επίσταμαι, I know in depth, I am able, επ + ίσταμαι = to stand above something Now the "being/είναι and ουσία may seem interchangeable and this because the form "είναι" means what is there indefinitely. (and we can still use the term with this notion synonymous with essence like "the being of man" "To είναι του ανθρώπου"). But there is also an alternative way of usage: the term είναι has taken the form of "what is there now" or what it seems a thing to be, what is its immediate existence and general formation, and this in contrast with ουσία/essence that is the substrate that stays the same regardless the accidentals applied to the being. So the being of a chair is this chair in front of me which may appear black, wooden but the essence of the chair is the piece of furniture we use to sit on regardless the differences (accidentals - συμβεβηκότα) between different forms of these. Synonymous with ουσία in some contexts is also the term physis (φύση) In Hegelian logic, the movement of the Being takes three steps: The immediate: Being (Είναι), the mediated (from other thoughts and reflective thinking): Essence (Ουσία), and the speculative-dialectical synthesis of the Being and Essence which is the Notion/Idea. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$

Α general reply to the questions without being able to deal in depth. "To make the world philosophical" means to develop the social relations at the level of science and philosophy where reason rules. For the "ruthless criticism of everything existing", means that parts of our social existence or our social relations which look like "holy beings", inaccessible to criticism, "sanctified", having taken the form of divine figures, we ought to be able to look them into the eyes, stripped of any social conventions, and to exercise a fundamental criticism to them so our world to be free to evolve and break the bonds that hold it back, like the effects that the past social relationships hold on the contemporary reality. 

The reference with the owl refers to the fact that the consciousness and the knowledge of history is completed after the events have taken place; at the end of an epoch, the spirit can gather itself, supervise them and make them parts of its consciousness. We are able to understand a historical period when we move outside of it and drawn to a new era. History is about the past and has the present as a limit. The becoming in dialectics is spiral, a completion of a cycle is not an end but the start of a new dialectical movement. A progress that has reached its end but also has an infinite distance to go, the ultimate goal that has been realized, but which is far from its realization (expressions of the finite-infinity relationship in the sphere of history), inconsistencies arise only if we persist in a one-sided, non-dialectical conception of the ontological categories. The removal of the finite-infinity contradiction, the overcoming of the romantic schism between the finite individuality and the infinite absolute, an infinite opposed to the finite falls into vicious infinity, the true infinity is a process in which infinity meets itself in its other. The historic present is an end to the historical movement, beyond which an infinitely wide future is being opened, when this end becomes a barrier, the philosophical conception of history is only possible as a lifting of the contradiction, as a point of completion, the present formulates a mediation request, allowing philosophical knowledge to develop a conceptual notion of its epoch. The philosophical understanding of history is possible only after the French revolution, that is, from the historical beginning of the realization of freedom in the world. This does not mean that somewhere in the world, the course of the spirit or history reaches its end. The spirit realizes its purpose as it has been revealed, but this does not preempt its future activity. The spirit is not overwhelmed, it is not exhausted and does not seek the bliss of immobility. $URL$ Reason in History (prolegomena P. Thanasas) 

After a discussion about the "difficulties to distinguish knowledge from faith" someone replied to me that the quote implies faith because it uses the word "think". But as it is generally understood: 

δρώμενο < δρώμενα < ancient Greek δρώμενα, neuter gender of δρώμενος, participle perfect tense passive of the verb δράω / δρῶ (δρώμενο) happening (usually plural: events) 

Nietzsche may seem "easy" at first glance but actually he is difficult. You may get an idea of philosophical skepticism applied to morality by reading his works. Nietzsche is a double-edge knife. You may like his style but there is a chance he may not like yours. Plato of course is very important, you are going to read his works again and again. More repetitive reading different levels of understanding or misunderstanding. Freud work The Interpretation of Dreams is an excellent piece of literature, and the work that Freud unfolds his psychological system. I believe Thales is regarded the "first philosopher" in the Greek tradition. $URL$ 

I was reading Andre Breton's "Anthology of Black Humor" and I found in one of the introductory notes a report addressing the theme of humor by Hegel. I think it is related to the treatment of comedy by Hegel and it is included in his work about Aesthetics. I have also read Freud's work "The Joke and Its Relation to the Unconscious" which i found very interesting. So the question is: What is the work of Hegel that includes this theme and what are other philosophers who have dealt with this issue? (comedy as an art form or humor in general) 

$URL$ $URL$ based on chance rather than being planned or based on reason Why do you think axioms are arbitrary? I think no one builds his morality according to morality theories but it is more or less an eclectic construction based on reflections of ones life, social-historic demands and values, cultural etc. My personal view is that some parts of ethic systems are crucial parts of humanity and others are not so important and change. About your question how to treat the different theories i think one rationalizes the premises of each one and judge the value of the "arbitrariness" of the proposed axioms. 

The skeptic argument is unreliable because it asserts the reality of its own proposition in contradiction to its own premises. It says: It is real that we can't prove anything is real. It is a self-defying argument. Skepticism is a tool inside reason and is not a procedure to derive proof about the world itself. 

They forgot consciousness is a manifestation of language carried by individuals in a society. And not any type of language but an advanced form of it. So my opinion is that Koch’s claim is out of question. 

Plato's Republic a. Anything beyond or different to a just action is unjust. Shakespeare's "King John I" b. If you try to make something "better than well", you won't be able to make it at all. (overestimating your skills) There is a way to make something well. Trying to make it "better"/differently (often) leads to disaster. (overzealous is regarded problematic) The saying does not refer to not try to get better, but that we should have as a goal the good, and that good is enough. If we try to go beyond good, often we will not find the better but will simply move away from the good and we will do the mediocre or even the bad. 

Here i present a rational dialectical view. i.e. When i watch a painting of course i have an idea of the painting but i know under certain circumstances that this is an objective idea. It corresponds to the painting itself and it is not an idea of an elephant camouflaged as a painting tricking my mind. Of course looking and thinking about the painting does not magically present me the "whole reality" of this painting, but i can study it if i like i.e. the paper, the technique, the meaning, the era everything, and at the end i will know that i study this specific painting objectively and not some hidden elephant like the Kantian thing-in-itself. So here it is: Considering "external reality of objects" is a bit tricky. External is regarded in opposition with "ourselves"-minds. Reality is ascribed on objects that exist on themselves in contrast with imaginations, some other type of false existence or non-existence. Objects are the things under consideration. So let's consider an example: I have here in my room a nice drawing above my bed. Is this external object real? I watch it everyday for the last 2 years so it must be real. Is there a possibility i watch an optical illusion for two years and i can also sense the paper etc? Sense and assumption can fool me but let's speculate that i confirm the existence of the object in a rational way. (i bring the poor scientists from the other answer so to make their tests on the painting and on me). So it should be real. On the other hand this painting is a specific object. A lot of people have drawings and have the same type of experience that these objects are real. Of course all these paintings are not the same object. Each of these is a different one. And we all confirm according to our experience tested in a rational way that these objects are real and different. Now let's consider that I take the painting and shred it to pieces. Is the object of the painting still real? No, now it is a shredded painting. Actually it is a mishmash of colored paper. What happened to the reality of the painting? It no longer exists. I still have a memory of the painting before i shred it to pieces. But from now on, it is no more an external but an internal presentation in my memory of the object before i destroyed it. The reality of the painting object was so fragile that it could stand only a small amount of force before it turns to its opposite. If I come to your house and i brought with me a bulk of shred colored paper and i present it to you and i say "here is a nice painting, i bring it to you as a gift", you will surely suppose that i' m a fool. Now i have a bulk of paper. Is it real? Yes it is real. What will happen if i burn it, will it still be real? Of course not. The paper is gonna turn to ashes and energy. The paper/object i had has disappeared and is no more real. Now i have to do with the reality of this lump of ash and the heat that diffused in the environment. So the most influential arguments for the "existence of real external objects" must take into account all aspects of the being. Existence is a dialectical category and is contradicted with non-existence. Worst of all, objects are real and not real at the same time. I'm real as a man but also I'm not really an elephant.
