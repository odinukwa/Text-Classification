In Buddhism there are concepts that are so complex that transcends beyond common reasonable, objective thinking. Therefore to your question, the answer is obviously "No". The question instead should be: Does common 'reasonable and objective' thinking downplay the depths of true Buddhism teachings? This will eventually guide you through your doubts. 

Your Karma, good or bad, will depend on how you treat, raise, and teach your child. It is What you do with him/her, that will result in good/bad/neutral karma. Hence, by just bringing a child into the world, it is neither a good or bad karma, it is neutral. 

You will have to be very distinct whether your attachment is towards: 1. Your positive influence to the world; 2. Your reward, no matter big or small; 3. Your egotistic sense of success; and/or 4. Your self/improvement, enlightenment, etc. If you are towards 1-3, you are not achieving enlightenment. If you feel you are towards 4 but you are not reducing any suffering, you are not achieving enlightenment either. Remember, enlightenment is not just about letting go, but void of suffering. Are you following the 4 noble truths? and the 8 folds paths in what you do? And by the way, egoistic achievement is NOT necessary for progress in science and technology. You can say it is a motivation for some people, but it is not the only possible motivation. Therefore, the "individualistic roots" are neither permanent nor necessary. 

The idea is similar to the philosophy of Adwaita Vedanta in Hinduism. We may worship GOD with form (sakara , finite) or without form (Nirakara ,Infinite) .Worshiping a Human being as God or Son of God or Incarnation of God or Representative of God on Earth (Prophet, teacher, leader) etc. ,..is the First stage of Human Spiritual Development. Worshipping the INFINITE Nature or Universe -- or-- the Invisible Power or Laws that move and control it,..is the Second sage of Human Spiritual Development. Scientists Studying the Universe or Cosmos , trying to discover the Laws , that Govern the Universe , are in practice , worshipping that Infinite God . An would be cosmologist , first studies the works of Scientists like Newton ,Einstein etc. and second studies the Universe Himself ,taking the latest available information into consideration. He gets satisfaction only in the second stage . As he continues his study ,he might change or modify the thinkings of previous scientists , like Newton or Einstein and at a later stage , may give his own views or theory of the working of the Universe. So , the logic is this --- First ..Worship and follow the Buddha and then Second.. , go beyond Buddha , and think of the Infinite Universe YOURSELF. 

Analyze it with a "Cause and Effect" rule. Once you find out the cause, analyze what are the root causes and why your negative minds are being triggered. Ask yourself some of these questions: Is it only you that are experiencing the Anger, or both? If both, is there some fundamental difference that can never be settled? If only you are experiencing this mind state, try position yourself in his/her shoes? Do your family members know? what are their thoughts? Is there a win-win solution? 

The question is: How does Kamma associate with "provocation"? Example 1: A says to B "Hit/kill me if you dare." Example 2: A tells B that killing is justified if the cause is right. In the above examples, and if B did the hitting/killing after the provocation, who's kamma is worse? A or B? And Why? 

If you have owned a pet bird before, you will understand the fact that birds cannot be enslaved in any ways. You can only tame a bird, not enslave. 

The main objective of Vipassana Meditation is to acquire.. Universal Consciousness ,Transcending Body Consciousness. Too much Psychological Stress or Physical suffering ,create STRONG BODY CONSCIOUSNESS . Too much pleasure creates ATTACHMENT TO THE BODY . The Buddha , therefore suggested the MIDDLE PATH ,for OPTIMAL PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT. However , in modern day situation ,working under HIGH STRESS and PHYSICAL PAIN , is quite COMMON. I believe , the spread of Christian Philosophy , is partly responsible for this. Christianity was taught to people living in Extreme Poverty .Live One Day at a time and leave the Future in the Hands of God , is the central teaching of Christianity . Buddhism , on the other hand , was taught mainly to The Rich and Princely classes (NOBILITY), who did not have to worry about their day to day Existence. Buddhist teaching , therefore, is centered around Future Planning. ..Christianity rejects or ignores Future Planning. Christianity believes in a Human, Father like God , who takes care of your Future.... Buddhism , on the other hand believes in a set of Universal and Eternal Laws , that governs the Material and Psychological Universe --on the basis of which , you can make future planning. Modern day Scientists , have succeeded in combining , these two concepts and succeeded in Cosmological Studies. A simple way to start with , will be , to study popular books on Cosmology.... This will help you ,to acquire Universal Consciousness, in-spite-of the stresses and pains , you are living with. 

The cause to your biases, speculation, stereotyping, jumping to conclusions,.....are your strong attachments to Impermanence. To cure this, you must Recognize the "Nature of impermanence". Once you did, your biases, speculation, stereotyping....will cease to exist, for they are also impermanent. 

It breaks the third precept whether or not there was wife's consent. Sexual misconduct include engaging sexual activities with multiple women... 

In simple terms: Precepts = refraining from actions. My understanding is that the 5 Precepts not only helps us from creating negative karma (Kamma = intention + actions) but also helps us in cultivating a foundation to release our attachment to the 5 Skandhas. (Actions being external factors of attachments.) To your question: [My question is how fair or correct to narrow third precept to sexual misconduct or adultery?] <--- I do not see any bits of "unfair" or "incorrectness" to limit sexual misconduct to the third precept. No matter in Theravada or Mahayana, they have given numerous examples and conditions on what is considered as Sexual Misconduct and inappropriate actions. And the range of stuff is very wide. [Does over-thinking violate third precept because its a misconduct of mind due to uncontrollable and misuse mind?] <--- No. The 5 precepts corresponds to actions only. Over-thinking is addressed through training the mind. A method of training one's mind is to observe how they arise from the 3 poisons: Greed, Hate, Ignorance, and then apply respective antidotes (Generosity, Loving-kindness, and Wisdom). This training is obviously the core teachings of the Buddha, i.e. the 4 noble truths and 8 folds paths. 

Advaita Philosophy was popularized by Acharya Shankara , who succeeded in convincing Indian Buddhists , that Buddhism is a branch of Hinduism.You may refer to the book " Shankara Digvijay--traditional life of Shankaracharya" ,written by Madhava-Vidyaranya ,published by the Ramakrishna Math , Chennai ( Madras) , India and available at Ramakrishna Mission Centres.Shankaracharya lived in the second half of Seventh Century AD (aroud 650 to 690 AD ).He succeeded in convincing Indian Buddhists , that Buddhism was a branch of Hinduism and succeeded in integrating Buddhism to Hinduism. Shankara also portrayed the Buddha as the Ninth Incarnation of Vishnu . Those Buddhists , who did not integrate with Hinduism ,were later (around Tenth Century AD) , slaughtered or converted to Islam by force , by the Muslim Invaders. Shankara's Philosophy is known as Advaita Vedanta Philosophy. But over the years ,it has undergone many modifications , by different preachers ,trying to popularise the idea in their own ways. Latest attempt at popularisation of Advaita Vedanta ,was by Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) ,who also founded the Ramakrishna Mission. Hinduism has many Books of knowledge ---the Vedas ,the Upanishads ans the Six Schools of Philsophies. The Vedas popularise worshiping different powers of Nature --like the Earth ,Sun ,Air ,Fire ,Lightening ,Sky etc. symbolised as Gods. Upanishads are philosophies of Individual Teachers -who tried to popularize the concept of One God --Creator ,Sustainer and Destroyer of the Universe .They also tried to integrate Individual Consciousness to Universal Consciouness and to Space and Time--assuming the existence of a set of Universal Laws. The Six Philosophical schools ,attempt to integrate the ideas of Upanishads , into a self consistent logical system. They are --(1)Shaankhya (2) Yoga (3) Nyaya (4) Vaisheshika (5) Purva Mimansa (6) Uttara Mimansa (Vedanta).Advaita Vedanta has evolved out of Vedanta . Literally Advaita means Not Two-ordinarily accepted as One or Zero.So the Universal God , can be One or Zero( Shunya or Space).In this philosophy , Existence and Non-Existence , are treated as two sides of the same coin.It assumes three sates of consciousness -waking , sleeping (dreaming) and deep sleep (unconsciousness ,coma or memory less)--all to be TRUE . And tries to INTEGRATE them to a SUPER_CONSCIOUS state--called the Ultimate Reality. For a beginner, trying to understand Advaita Vedanta and its links to Buddhist philosophies ( or Tantra) , I would suggest going through the works of Swami Vivekananda. 

You can always build your "worldly success" while practicing Buddhism. There is no conflict of each other. If you are talking about go the monastic direction and live like a monk, that's a totally different story. 

All relationships are subject to impermanence, just like all illusions. Also, the way you perceive a relationship, will always differ to the other person within that particular relationship. The relationship is merely 'true' only within your perception, which is also impermanent, just like an illusion. 

Dreams are fragmentation/de-fragmentation of your memories. Memories are based on a combination of your worldly senses from eyes , ears , nose ,tongue, body , mind....etc. 

It was never about blind belief. It is about faith in the direction of the path. By the time you reach the path's end, faith is not required, because you already know. Without faith or belief, you would be on your foot, forever questioning about your own belief, without taking one step for eternity. 

To teach mindfulness is one thing; To teach the dharma is another thing. Supplementing my original comment to the question and simply put: If the corporation is unethical, anything/any means that supports this corporation, is unethical. 

" For every action , there is an equal and opposite reaction ". This is a Fundamental law of Physics and is applicable to Human Mental activities. If fear comes as a reaction to the feeling of Intense Love ,you have to Absorb these reactions . Assume that these fears are Unreal and Temporary,wait for some time and allow the fears to die down .And then , continue with your daily activities--in this case--Meditation. 

According to the Law of Action and Reaction ,Every action of the Individual will be Neutralized by a Reaction from Nature. If you want Body Consciousness ,then you must think of Universal Consciousness. If you are concentrating or observing or being conscious of your Breathing Process (Pranayama) ,then think that the Air that you Breathe ,fills the Universe and Infinite Space as Ether . The Air becomes less and less dense ,as we move away from the Earth ,but it never-the-less exists as Ether (Sunya or Brahma ) . This thought will create an Universal Consciousness . Body Consciousness will come as a Reaction to this thought . An alternative , is to study some popular books on Cosmology.
