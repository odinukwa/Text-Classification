Another problem, if you're cycling in slushy snow, is that ice/snow can build up on the inside of the fender, and eventually interfere with the tire - especially if the wheel isn't perfectly round. 

As you point out that it's on the spoke side of the tube, my guess would be that the rim tape is off. (Or worn.) I had a similar problem, where I got a puncture roughly every week, and it turned out that the rim tape was moving. It looked OK when I opened everything up, but must have shifted when I put it together. However, don't do what I did, which was to cover the rim tape with duct tape. While it did stop the streak of punctures, it also meant that the next time I had to take it apart there was gooey glue stuff everywhere. EDIT Change the rim tape. - Even if it looks OK it might shift when you pump the innertube. 

And here the brake pad reaches the rim if I have a little angle between the bridge and the brake, but I can tighten the brake in that position: Is there anything I can do to install this brakes in this bike? 

As I learned in this question, the cog of my freewheel are damaged and should be replaced. I've been searching for some information but I'm still not sure of what I need. At the beginning I though I just needed to search for a cog like this with 1/8" like my chain: 

As tools a I just have the basics, when i search for freewheel remover I see hundreds of different things like this: 

I can't see what is wrong with the new ones, that doesn't allow the right side to reach the rim, because the height of both seems to be the same. The width of the tyre (28) should not be the problem as the front one works perfectly There is a washer that was in the old brakes but does't make any difference for this problem if I put it or not. To show better the problem. This is the bridge: 

There is no definite yes or no answer whether helmets are effective. It is a choice which level of risk you want to accept, balanced against the inconvenience. When you search for "bike helmets", you'll quickly see that the arguments are very heated without much agreement. It is true that traumatic brain injuries are terrible, and if you hit your head, it's often (not always) better to have a helmet. However, to evaluate the risk you also have to take into account how likely it is to hit your head. Traumatic brain injuries also happen with similar likelihood when walking (stumble, slip on ice and hit your head on the kerb), in buildings (slippery floor after wiping...), or when being hit by a car that mounts the pavement or indeed being hit by a bicycle. Most people don't even think about those risks and don't wear a helmet all the time when walking or driving or when wiping the kitchen floor, so it is somewhat inconsistent that bicycle helmets are so intensely promoted. The actual risk depends very much on your riding style and environment. If you ride really fast, or do mountain biking, or perhaps you are a bit unstable or have a medical condition that you may lose balance, then the risk is higher and it makes sense to chose a helmet. However, if you are a slow cyclist, have good cycle paths and are generally a careful cyclist, then the risk isn't any higher than the risk of falling when you walk, so in this group many chose quite logically not to wear a helmet. Other people may wear a helmet in winter when they know there can be icy patches on their commute, but not in summer when the risk of falling is much less. So it's really a personal choice if you think your personal risk, depending on riding style, ability and environment, is higher than the risk of falling or getting into a collision when you walk. Additional note: Be cautious about drawing conclusions from personal anecdotes. You'll find lots of stories of the type "wearing a helmet saved my life" and "didn't wear one and suffered terrible injuries". It is usually not possible to know if an injury could have been avoided with a helmet. Helmets absorb only very limited amounts of energy, so if you e.g get hit by a truck's wing mirror the helmet will do virtually nothing as the energy is just too high. 

I have a singlespeed with a flipflop hub to change to fixed gear. In my freewheel sprocket I have 16 teeth and in the ring chain 46 teeth. For me this is almost always the perfect combination for touring where I live. But sometimes I want to go up a mountain (15-17% ) and I,m not strong enough to keep pedaling. I,d like to have the fixie side as backup for those occasions with more teeth. I don't have any local shop to try gear ratios so I have t guess and buy. Is there any method to guess how many more teeth do I need considering what I already have? I can go around 15km/h in a 7%hill. 

But reading the description it seems like it's only for fixed gears, so I was completely worng. Searching for more items under the single speed category in the website everything looked like that. What do I need to buy as replacement? This is how what I have now: 

I recently changed the speedometer on my bike, and had some problems to adjust the magnet on the spokes as well as the sensor. (The spokes are flat, and the magnet that came with the sensor was intended for round spokes. And there's not much clearance between the fork and the spokes.) But in the end I managed to get it up and running with a couple of mm gap between the two. However. When I accelerate hard or go up steep hills I notice that the magnet hits the sensor. Apparently the front wheel flexes significantly, even when I'm not standing up or pulling seriously at the handlebars. Is this normal? How much flex would one expect in the front wheel? It's a new CF road bike and the wheels are 'FSA Team 30', decent entry-level aluminium wheels, according to most reviews. 

Do you live in a region with efficient and non-corrupt police? Then it might be useful to get advice from them, and report the incidents to them. The police can sometimes act even if there has not been an actual collision. From your description, it seems that you think that driver behaviour is the problem, not your own skills. You should of course check if you can do anything yourself to be safer (the other replies give advice on that), but driver behaviour is definitely often an issue. Dangerous behaviour can be due to several factors, and without knowing the specifics of each incident it is not really possible to judge. It could be anything from inexperience, honest mistakes, misjudging a complicated situation, inattention, not knowing how much space cyclists need, all the way to people who have a grudge against cyclists for whatever reason and deliberately try to "teach you a lesson", for example a "punishment pass" that doesn't quite hit you but scares you to death. When you feel threatened or in danger, then you should contact to the police. If they are competent, they will be able to judge if drivers threaten you deliberately, but in most countries there are also laws that cover dangerous or careless driving. It might be difficult to have enough evidence, but often the police can at least speak to the driver or even issue a warning, which may already help to make them aware and change their behaviour. If it happens frequently, then you should think about getting a camera to collect evidence. But note that recording others is not legal in all countries. You should definitely be careful before you upload clips on the internet - besides being possibly illegal, it can also reduce the chances of getting a conviction, because a widely shared youtube video can mean (in some jurisdictions) that the accused can't get a fair trial, so the case will not even be tried. Therefore, do show the video to the police first, get advice if they can do anything, but don't put it on youtube. Besides driver behaviour, there are also cases where the road design leads to conflict, e.g. cycle lanes dumping you into fast traffic where drivers don't expect you, or bad sightlines at junctions. Again, it is helpful to report such incidents, as many police forces need this information to know about "hotspots" to focus their work on. 

My trusty old CF racer was stolen the other day, and I'm looking for a replacement. I saw this bike at PlanetX and was intrigued. It's a full carbon bike with (last years) Ultegra components for a very reasonable price ( < $2k). It comes with a compact crankset and a short-cage dérailleur. The largest cassette it can accommodate is 11-28, which would give me a lowest gear of 34-28. Not bad, and the same as I had before. But I live in the Alps and I frequently find myself in the lowest gear well before I hit the steepest parts of the hills, so I would like to have a lower gear, if at all possible. I spoke to the vendor, and they said that it would (at least in theory) be possible to put on a medium-cage dérailleur and an 11-30 cassette. But I was wondering if it would be possible to have a smaller chainring in front instead. Can you get smaller than 34? Or would that not fit? At some level I'm contemplating putting on a triple instead, but that seems like going back to the 20th century... 

I wasn't really happy with the brakes so I decided to search for a good used ones. I found a good offer for the shimano 7800 BR and bought them. I installed the front one without problems but the rear one is being a nightmare. The problem: When I try to install the shimano brakes one pad reaches perfectly the rim but the other one (opposite side than the cable) does not reach the rim and collides with the rubber of the tire. I can't find which model of brakes did the bike had, I can only see the brand written and it says promax. Here are some photos of the two brakes: 

I've been using the last year thickslicks to driver mainly inside my city and I usually tried to don't go through anything else but asphalt to prevent punctures. I've been wondering if going through a rocky path (or something similar with lot of little rocks) with thickslicks (700x28) and pressure around 100psi is more likely to get a puncture than the traditional wider and with tread tires that most MTB bikes have. Example with no tread: 

Rims last a lot longer than brake pads. It's difficult to put a number, as it depends on so many parameters, but personally I change brake pads roughly once a year (2-3'000km), and I haven't ever changed a rim due to it wearing out. (There has always been other reasons to change them.) On many rims there's a tiny groove in the middle of the braking surface. You're supposed to change the rim when the bulk of the rim has worn down to that level. (But as I said, it hasn't happened to me yet.) Regarding your other advice, 'replacing cassette, chain ring and chain together', it's not the most common of advice, to put it bluntly. The advice you're likely to get is to change the chain when it's starting to wear (you have to measure the length of it, either with a special chain-tool, or with a tape measure. If it's increased by 1% it's time to change.) If you don't change the chain it will start to wear down the cassette, and eventually the chain ring - but that takes a lot longer.)
