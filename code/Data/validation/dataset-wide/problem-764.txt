Unless you happen to watch a nuclear explosion or a gamma ray burst or anything like that (very, very unlikely), no ordinary object in the night sky reflects or emits enough light to damage your eyes or fry your chip. Partly because they are very far away. The only thing in the sky that can and will do that is the sun. So if you are watching at night, you are perfectly safe. So is your camera. What can happen is that watching the moon or Jupiter can wreck your eye's ability to view faint or dim objects. Eyes need up to 30 minutes (give or take) to adapt to solid darkness. Brighter objects will partly or completely reset that ability so you have to wait a while until your eyes are truly sensitive again. Imagine this: The moon is the brightest thing in the night sky. You can watch it all night long. If you use a bigger telescope, a gray filter might be nice, but it's not bright enough to heat your eyeballs. Numbers on the internet range between 1/400000 and 1/1000000 as bright as the sun. 

Density waves cause the build up of galactic material in to spiral arms. An object does not have to stay in a spiral arm; it can join or leave it as the density wave passes through the galaxy. However, the likelihood of an object being in a spiral arm is greater. The shape of the arms does not relate to matter falling in; this is an illusion. Objects perform elliptical or near-circular orbits around the center of the galaxy. The origin of these density waves is not known conclusively, though there are many simulations that re-create the effect through satellite galaxy perturbations. 

So the question is, Can black holes be really be extraordinarily bright due to lensing of background objects? Let's first also specify that these black holes must certainly be super massive. If not, we're talking about stellar mass black holes (or intermediate mass black holes), and the lensing signal would be much weaker. More mass = more lensing generally speaking (there are some exceptions, e.g. - microlensing, where the lensing is done by stars in our own Milky Way galaxy and the signal is enhanced because the source and lens are aligned nearly perfectly). This is an important statement to make because virtually every galaxy has been identified with a super massive black hole at its center. The reverse is also true - every super massive black hole is associated with a galaxy. It's also important to note that, realistically speaking, galaxies have total masses of about $\sim10^{11} - 10^{12} M_{\odot}$, whereas super massive black holes typically have masses of millions to hundreds of millions (maybe even billions) of solar masses. This is a smallish fraction of the total mass. This means that most of the lensing will be done by the galactic halo and not the super massive black hole. If we modeled the center of the lens galaxy as a point-lens, and the galactic halo as a singular isothermal sphere, the relevant question I would ask is what are their Einstein radii (which is a measure of how effective or efficient they are at lensing) individually, and what are they in combination? Essentially, how much does the existence of a central super massive black hole matter to the system as a whole. Strong lensing features (arcs, rings, or multiple images) generally occur at around the Einstein radius of the object. My best guess: Quite honestly I don't see the central super massive black hole mattering all that much when it comes to lensing. Many of these mass profile models for the lens galaxy halo are singular, or rise very rapidly to a central core. Furthermore, I've never really heard of a situation where a lone super massive black hole (not associated with a galaxy - call it a 'rogue' smbh if you will) has been found floating around in space to do this sort of lensing. They generally hide at the centers of galaxies, or show themselves only if they're actively accreting material. Correct me if one has been found (maybe it would come from a merging of two smbh's where one is kicked out of the system). 

I assume you mean contraction, as opposed to the current expansion that we see today due to dark energy. Again this would be unfeasible due to the reasons outlined above, and if contraction was to proceed to it's conclusion, i.e. a singularity like the Big Bang, then no information from this universe could be carried through that singularity, even if there was another universe on the other side. 

The density increases as you move closer to the center of the star. Note how the density is less than that of water for up to half the sun's radius! 

Well the angular resolution of a telescope depends on two things: 1) The wavelength of light you're looking in, and 2) the diameter of the primary lens/mirror. $$ \theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}$$ where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and $D$ is the diameter of the lens. Light collecting power is simply how many photons you can collect in a particular wavelength in a given amount of time. Essentially, the bigger the bucket (or lens/mirror), the more rain you can catch. You can sort of get around light collecting power by increasing your exposure time. But, if the size of the object you're trying to observe is smaller than your telescope's resolving power, I don't believe there is really much you can do about it. Being limited by the resolution of your telescope is called being diffraction limited, but most telescopes on Earth are usually seeing limited due to the atmosphere's smearing effects. 

A Barlow lens doesn't multiply the focal length of your eyepiece, it multiplies the focal length of your telescope. Example: Let's use a telescope of 1000mm focal length. 8" f/5 Newtonian, for example. And you have a 10mm and 25mm Eyepiece and a 3x barlow. Then the barlow turns these 1000mm into 1000 x 3 = 3000mm focal length. The magnification is always: FL telescope / FL eyepiece. That means, with the barlow, you have 3000 / 10 = 300x magnification or 3000 / 25 = 120 x magnification. Without barlow it's 100x (10mm) and 40x (25mm) An eyepiece is a magnification lense. You can put two eyepieces on top of each other. You just won't see anything useful with that. Lens systems are carefully designed to result in an eyepiece that works. Eyepieces with a bigger focal length give smaller magnification. 

There are around 2 trillion galaxies in the currently observable universe according to the latest estimates, obtained by integrating theoretical galaxy stellar mass functions above $10^{6} M_{\odot}$ between $0 \leqslant z \leqslant 8$. It's difficult to get a precise number for the total observed galaxies as the results from new surveys are being released all the time, and updated analysis of legacy data is revealing more galaxies. For example, the latest SDSS data release identified close to 200 million galaxies, whilst the ongoing Dark Energy Survey seeks to identify around 300 million galaxies. LSST, in Chile, will observe close to 20 billion galaxies, an order of magnitude greater than anything before it. However, all of these surveys operate up to relatively low redshifts. Probing to higher redshifts requires bigger, preferably space based telescopes, and much longer exposure times. As such, the high redshift universe has been poorly documented. Our understanding of galaxy formation at high redshift is not as complete as at low redshift, and so we may be under- or over-estimating the number of galaxies at this epoch. A vague upper limit: we've observed less than 0.01% of all currently observable galaxies. 

by running what's known as a survey. These are large projects which maps out the positions (and potentially other properties, depending on what their science goals are) of galaxies in the universe. How you should look at this picture is the following: 1) You're at the center of the image, 2) Each point in the picture represents an individual galaxy, 3) Distance from the observer, the redshift of a galaxy, increases with increasing distance from the center, and 4) as you travel around the circle in angle, you're sweeping through the right ascension coordinate of the celestial coordinate system (think longitude). You're seeing a pizza slice instead of a sphere because this is a particular slice in declination (lattitude). As you look to higher redshifts, you are looking further back into time, and earlier into the universe's history. This is how astronomers/cosmologists can say something statistically about models of structure formation of the universe (how objects like galaxies, and clusters of galaxies came to be). The problem with looking at galaxies at very high redshifts is that they become very faint. At a certain point, you need more powerful telescopes to continue looking further back in time. Though, we can get around this somewhat by looking at the radiation component of the universe at microwave wavelengths (most surveys are in the optical region of the electro-magnetic spectrum). This radiation is called the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), and can also be mapped out (see: COBE,WMAP, and most recently Planck satellites). 

Eyepieces are carefully designed. They try to achieve a sharp image with good contrast over a wide field of view. Even the simplest eyepieces of type Huygens consist of two lenses that match up. Good eyepieces can have 7 or more lenses. In the end every eyepiece is a fancy magnifying glass, so your CD ROM lens will work. It will just not make for a good image. It'll be much worse than the 10/25mm Pl√∂ssl eyepieces that so many sell for cheap or sometimes even give away. They sell them for cheap because even though they are much better than any single lens, they are still on the lower end of the quality spectrum. Another problem is: the CD ROM lens has a tiny focal length which will result in very high magnification and a very dark image. A rule of thumb says: twice your mirror diameter in mm is about the useful upper limit for magnification. If you have an 8" reflector, that would be 200mm x 2 = 400x. Nonetheless an interesting experiment. You can try to put a cardboard ring in front of your telescope to give it a longer focal ratio. It might help a little while costing a lot of light and resolution. You can see 5 planets without any magnification. To see details, I'd say the fun starts at around 150-200x even though they appear as a disc at much lower magnification. 

It depends on whether the black hole is rotating or not. If it is, The ergosphere and singularity are oblate spheroids. If not, both would be spherical. The event horizon is always spherical. Accreting matter around a black hole would form an accretion disk, however this should not be mistaken for the black hole itself. 

I am unaware of there being a single Helium line that is as prominent or useful as the 21cm line is for Hydrogen. The 21 cm line is due to a hyperfine transition in the 1s ground state of hydrogen. It is notable due to its strength, and also its usefulness for mapping neutral hydrogen in the universe, which is impossible in the optical since it is absorbed by neutral Hydrogen. It was in fact the first such spectral line observed in the radio part of the spectrum, and is so fundamental that the Pioneer and Voyager probes used the length of the transition as a time and distance unit on the plaques they carry, so that potential extraterrestrials could decode the messages. There are many more spectral lines in the radio from heavier elements, and a whole field dedicated to observing and understanding them: radio frequency spectroscopy. For Helium in particular, hyperfine lines can also be observed; the hyperfine transition of the $^3$He isotope has a wavelength ~4mm. The same isotope also emits a recombination line, where an electron recombines with an ion and falls to lower energy levels, emitting a photon in the process. The wavelengths of such recombination lines for Hydrogen like atoms (singly ionised in the case of Helium, so that it has a single electron) can be estimated using the Rydberg Formula: $$\nu = R_{m}c\left[\frac{1}{n^2}-\frac{1}{(n+\Delta n)^2}\right]$$ where $R_m$ is the reduced mass Rydberg constant, $n$ is the final state and $\Delta n$ is the change in state. Estimating the strengths of such lines is a little more complicated, but there are details here. 

The answers provided to this question so far seem to be good. The easiest way I'd say is to take a long exposure picture in one of two places: 1) At the zenith (directly overhead), if you see that your picture looks like this: 

I think you mean to ask, "What is the local sidereal time of Greenwhich?". To calculate the GMST (Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time): 

This is a great question. I know of a couple of really big things about inflation people want to be able to nail down by using the cosmic microwave background. The first is measuring what are known as E- and B- modes, which are the curl-free and divergence-free components to the modes of cmb radiation:
