Well, a lot of institutions do both. At my Thai Forest (Theravdin) sangha, there are golden images, and we also give to charity, and obviously we do not charge for any services. The retreats, and even the Thai language classes, are completely donation-based. We do not shame anyone who cannot donate anything, and people with means donate more than enough to make-up for it. So we make sure that nothing keeps people from learning, not even lack of funds. Not everyone will probably agree with this, but I propose that artistic beauty is an intrinsic good. This is why we continue to promote the arts in the secular world--I can't eat a beautiful painting, but it can nourish my mind, even if only in the moment I am looking at it. In my experience with working and feeding homeless people in a religious setting, many liked that we were providing them with food and warm shelter in the cold, as well as a beautiful setting to just appreciate our art. I don't know if many of us who have an almost unlimited access to beautiful images through internet searches can fathom living a life where all you saw was ugly, dark decay. It does not make for a healthy mind, which goes hand-in-hand with a healthy body. So to answer your question, in the real world, it does not have to be an either/or decision (between beauty/charity), nor is it a zero-sum game where charity is sacrificed for art. When there are greedy people heaping up image after image for greed's sake, perverting the purpose of Buddhist imagery--which is to communicate the dharma--there should be accountability. The presence of art wouldn't hinder the advocacy of accountability. 

Have experience when notting the thoughts as impermanence disappears the body and thoughts together .But still there's somebody looking at and it goes into a cloudy space. What is this experience?Is it stream winner? 

During meditation consciousness of ear nose eye tongue body sensation have disappeared. No sensations for a while and start emerge of thoughts. When see the thoughts clearly there are spaces between them. Suddenly came up a light. Then breath appeared. What is the experience? Is it stream winning?Is the vinnanaya have experience? 

Now I feel lazy to meditate because less thoughts no breath to observe. once I observe the body ,it isn't disappears .experience the vibration of mind and feel there is a connection between brain and mind through blood. 

The first statue is not Gautama Buddha (commonly referred to as "the Buddha"), but is Budai, a depiction of a loving and jovial Chinese monk, who is often considered a depiction of Maitreya, the next Buddha who will come into the world eons from now. Even some of the "skinny" Buddha statues may or may not be an image of Gautama Buddha. It mostly depends on the mudras (position of the hands) and the symbols used in the depiction. For example, usually Gautama Buddha has at least one palm facing inward with his fingers pointed towards the ground, but often today, commercialized statues sold in the west depict him in any kind of way because they do not understand the mudras and symbolism. 

During meditation lost the sound awareness raped by a cover and only cittarupa come and stopped no doer and knower operate for a short time. Is it a jhana?Experience this 3 to 4 times.before that experience the citta as poping out of thoughts and discreet isolated spaces inbetween them . Brilliant light appears while experience the citta and another knowing came as if there is no thoughts wisdom will arise.is it the pure citta have experience 

This time when the controller of the breath disappears thoughts too disappear cittarupa stop by presenting a line across and the top of it there is a picture of a person. After a minute breath appeared. And there was no observer too at that time. What is the meaning of the cittarupa which appeared and what is the stage? 

The general understanding is that even the most beautiful objects we have on earth still pale in comparison to the beauty of the dharma, and this is just our feeble attempt to reflect that, and, like Jyothi said, offer our best to the Supreme One, who gives us a much more valuable gift.

It's not really a rationalization, since ethical behavior in Shin Buddhism isn't done to gain something, even though it generally results in a more peaceful, happy life. It is more like a result of the transformative power of shinjin. Reference: Living in Amida's Universal Vow, "Ethics in American Jodo-Shinshu: Trans-ethical Responsibility", pg. 201 

If see the citta during meditation how it links to depend origin?is seeing the citta cause liberation as sotapanna? 

Experience the vibration of the mind and it is being reduced during meditation. What is it indicates?And dissolution of defilments(klesha)occurs. 

When meditation experience mind without body loss sensation about the environment where I am and feel like mind is in the sky by hearing voice of birds.is it a jhana? 

During meditation if no doer and knower operate citta come for knowing. Means thoughts coming with spaces without external object. Is this what do you call citta? Is thoughts are due to citta operate without self ?when loba dvesa moha cease citta subjects to cease. Is it like that? 

In Jodo Shu and Jodo Shinshu, Amitabha Buddha is the sole object of devotion, because to be devoted to Amitabha Buddha is seen to be devoted to all the Buddhas, in spirit and practice. Reciting Nembutsu is seen as fulfilling the aspirations of all the Buddhas, including Shakayamuni and Avalokitesvara. From "What Kind of Buddha Is Amitabha?", A Discourse by Dharma Master Huijing, Xiamen, China; October 2006: 

The founder of Shin Buddhism, Shinran, assumed that a person of shinjin (grounded faith) would naturally be inclined to refrain from harmful actions. These quotes are all from various letters that Shinran wrote: 

Practically, religious images are made using precious medals to prevent decay, so that the image can be available to venerate for many generations to come. From a more devotional aspect, choosing materials that we think of as beautiful shows a great reverence for the person that image represents. Religious images often "open and lift our minds" to higher ideals, including dharma practice, which is why, for example, people can be better practiticioners just by being in the temple's main hall, where the main images usually are. I suppose a good analogy is showing respect for your boss and co-workers by coming to work in what best represents the workplace's business casual dress code, not just in a T-shirt with holes. Or, having enough respect for yourself to attend to your basic hygiene before leaving your home. Precious metals and stones are frequently used in religious imagery. For example, in the Larger Pureland Sutra (Verse 54), we have: 

Did meditation; when concentration on the breath at the tip of the nose suddenly controller has disappeared and cittarupa came without control.Is it a stage that knower and doer disappeared?after the experience feel like no self at that time. 

Having seen that anger disappears after notice attractiveness or aviation of mind towards thoughts has disappeared. Feel like no core on mind objects. Is that anatta? 

On personal practice now no likes or dislike on thoughts no thinking too. what is the stage of mindfulness? 

During meditation lost connection between body and the thoughts. Body remains silent but thoughts stop arise that particular matter .which are arise remain as a flow.What is this experience?
