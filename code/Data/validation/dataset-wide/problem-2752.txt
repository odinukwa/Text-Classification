Why no? Well, human nature, that's what it is. Evolution went that way that many people have quite strong desire for sex and many of people are not okay with having single mate in their lives. There is evidence sustaining this point of view: sperm competition in humans, a huge list of love goddesses which have involved some sexual cults and a variety of myths describing their gods to be polygamous. Because of that it is hard and unnatural for many people to think of sex as of something bad. 

This seemingly simple question does not have simple answer. Instead the answer is complex and ambiguous, at least if we try to view things from as many as possibly angles. The answer is: both yes and no. How so? Isn't this a contradiction? Of course it is and contradictions are destructive for human minds. But I went off-topic here, so now I rather explain things. 

Are the persons, who like non-intellectual labour, as I said in the start of my post, dangerous? I don't think so. It would not be better to create people who like non-intellectual labour (take "Brave New World" for example) than to create machines doing it. 

Of course "sex in itself is good" does not mean "rape/unwanted pregnancy/whatever else considered undesirable is good" as latter, for example contradicts "well-being is good" even when first is taken true. 

Why am I thinking people considering sex as concept to be bad? Well, if people would assume that sex is good by itself then they would carry the burden of proof of it's "badness" in given circumstances. So, they would explore such circumstances in which sex should be thought to be bad/wrong/etc. But it is not the usual way of thinking in society. Since people are trying to find out in what circumstances sex is good instead, I am assuming the opposite. 

Yes and no. As you said, there are many ethical theories, therefore, morality is subjective. But your arguments about psychopathy is not sound. Well, I assume that, at least for me freedom is first definition. Then the question: why am I not killing or raping others? The answer: I simply don't want to. So, putting me and people who are like me together and accepting first definition of freedom won't result in incoherency. I am not trying to say, of course, the murderers should not be punished. But I don't agree that definition of freedom is entirely psychopathic. It is, when it is used by a psychopath (and not always, as some psychopaths are not immoral), but not in other cases. 

Power "on paper" - power established via laws and documents. Power abuse - usage of power (given by others/society) to act in the way one is not supposed (in theory, by others/society) to. Anarchy - the social system that rejects power "on paper". 

Let us assume the proposition: one might take leader role. Then we apply universalization: if everyone takes leader role, no one is the leader. Thus, we proved that taking leader role is useless concept and maxim is not to take leader role. So, everyone should have same rights in everything. This means anarchy (I don't think it equals direct democracy, since majority still does not represent everyone). So, my question is why haven't Kant end up with the same result using the same reasoning? Did he have any reason not to apply universalization rule in politics? Or was there another reason? 

"Someone" means existential quantifier. In case of (a) you can see that someone is under negation and the first formula is "∃x: x is smoking" where second is "¬(∃y: y is smoking)". In (b) second formula is "∃y: ¬(y is smoking)". Here we take x and y as different variables since "someone" in first and second sentences may refer to different objects. When speaking about "it's" we take the same variable in both sentences. And we do not even consider quantification. Thus any of them should be "x is moving. ¬(x is moving)". 

One of my arguments for anarchy is that power abuse can only be eliminated by eliminating power "on paper" itself. But maybe I am wrong and there exist other ways to prevent power abuse without getting rid of power "on paper". If it's the case then what are them? I assume realistic answers, not based upon ideal politicians, who never abusing the power due to their characters. What are the most notable ways of preventing power abuse without eliminating power "on paper" among philosophers? What philosophers have already said on this topic? 

So, as you can see, it won't necessarily result in emancipation from labour, but it is surely possible. Also, I should note that automation of non-intellectual labour is desirable, whatever the consequences people are seeing. E.g. @jobermark wrote 

She thought that laissez-faire capitalism is the only social system capable of promoting human rights. But how did she explain that if she did at all? There are so many problems with laissez-faire capitalism (and capitalism in whole) and I don't see how can it be the best choice to promote rights. If you want to ask me what is the problem with capitalism: it promotes tricking (actually deception). Thus the one who tricks (and the one who does not care about others in fact) will be higher in social hierarchy in such society. But since such person will be higher in society, it could do the politics, through mass media and mercenaries, which are oppresing those who are lower in hierarchy. And this is, in my view, fail of laissez-faire capitalism. Actually, the most confusing part is that laissez-faire capitalism is the only social system that allows promotion of rights. While I already skeptical on that it at all really does it's work, I'm even more skeptical on that there is nothing elsethat promotes human rights. Then what actually makes laissez-faire capitalism (in her view) as the best one and what actually did Rand compare to decide what society would be the best? 

So, there is an important word "deceive". If the speaker intentionally, in order to deceive people, says "The outcome can only be 1 or 2." he is lying. Because: a) The statement is wrong. b) It is made in order to deceive people. 

I heard about Kant's reasoning that lying that you return money or about the leads to contradiction in conception. But how could he even prove that lying under any circumstances leads to contradiction in conception? My example: Let us assume some kind of soft extortionists. They threaten people to give them money but only if people have them. But they do not check if it is true since they are afraid of consequences (it can even result in murder and/or imprisonment). Now let's assume that all people lie to them that they do not have money. Since they all lie, extortionists do no get money. Even if they are in doubt of people's words. After many unfortunate attempts they give up. Isn't this a counterexample for "do not lie" duty? If so, how can Kantianism even prove that perfect duties even exist? And moreover the perfection of any particular duty. 

About Christian faith and current non-Christian ethics. Yes, they are not Christian anymore, but that does not mean it has not influence on current ethics. Right as someone who escaped Christianity may still agree with Christians on what is good or bad only referring to beliefs. 

Why just watching for simulated world is interference in our world? Because photons projected from screen can be reflected and (almost neglibly, but still it's not zero interference) affect the computer. Whether such analogy makes sense is another question. And I'd say this question can not be answered from position of knowledge. 

While there is no interference that still does not mean god[s] is/are not watching what happens in our world. Of course, even just watching in our world is interference in our world but our physical laws might not apply outside of universe. But escape god[s]' changing in deism is much simpler. We might even consider god[s] no more exist[s]. 

It can't be true that X is good and not good at the same time. This means something is wrong with premises. Wikipedia states that Moore begs for question in second premise. But I don't see anything wrong with second premise. We can replace goodness of X by any other statement and thus say any question is meaningless. But actually, it's unintuitive to think that no question is meaningful. Therefore it's in the first statement - "If X is Y, then the question "Is true that X is Y" is meaningless." What exactly is wrong in such a proposition? 

I could not give better name for this theory, so I call it "Instrumentalist value theory". According to this theory nothing is intrinsically valuable. Nothing and no one can be treated as ends, but only as means. This in no way means being disrespectful towards others, because it is possible to get positive experience from respecting others (and therefore being respectful acquires instrumental value). Satisfaction and dissatisfaction also are not intrinsically valuable: they helped people to survive and pass natural selection. Passing natural selection also is not intrinsically valuable... In the end for something to be intrinsically valuable there must be prime cause, but even if there is one, it is incomprehensible for our minds. Further, there is no difference between "morally bad" and "bad in amoral sense". E.g. a bad pen is the one that does not write. The purpose of pen is to write and we want a pen to write, that's why the pen that does not write is bad. A human is bad when [s]he does what we wish them not to do: commiting crimes, abuse others, being greedy, etc. Animal also can be bad: rabid dog is bad because it's dangerous. There should be some actions taken in order for that dog not to infect people with rabies. There can be some values which are universal: no sane person wants to live in unstable society where you can easily be killed, robbed, raped, etc. But there are some subjective and emotive values as well: some people do not like LGBT, while some people (not necessarily LGBT themselves) find it acceptable for them to exist. This theory denies the morality, yet produces some propositions about actions considered moral/immoral. This leaves me the question: is this theory morally nihilistic? Is it philosophical or scientific? Ethics are considered to be a philosophy but if I reject morality, do I put it to the science? 

In philosophy there is a concept of moral objectivity, so, your reasoning does not work in philosophy, as there can be potentially objective definition of freedom. In the end you came here to discuss it, thus you already accepted it's not philosophically useless concept. 

So, the reason why question is meaningless is not because it has a positive answer, but because the answer is unknown, either it is positive or negative. This is a mistake made by Moore in his first premise. And open question argument disproval. 

I see that majority of adults are trying to hide the notions of sex from minors. Both parents from their children and legislators from all children through various laws. I also see some critique towards ideas that people are polygamous. E.g. some people use the argument "We are not animals, we are better, we evolved to be monogamous." Of course, this is logical fallacy, but still, people somewhy resort to it. But what is the reasoning for that? Is that because those people consider sex as concept to be "bad"? If so then what are the arguments for such way of thought? By concept I mean generalization to all extensions.
