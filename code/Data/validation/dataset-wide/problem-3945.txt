OK, I have a proof which meets your conditions. I relied on this write up of the standard proof as a reference. Lemma 1: Let $K/F$ be an extension of fields, and let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials in $F[x]$. Let $d_F(x)$ be the GCD of $f$ and $g$ in $F[x]$ and let $d_K(x)$ be the GCD of $f$ and $g$ in $K[x]$. Then $d_F(x)$ and $d_K(x)$ coincide up to a scalar factor. Proof: Since $d_F(x)|f(x)$ and $d_F(x)|g(x)$ in $K[x]$, we have $d_F(x)|d_K(x)$. Now, there are polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ in $F[x]$ such that $f(x) p(x) + g(x) q(x) = d_F(x)$. So $d_K(x) | d_F(X)$. Since $d_F(x)$ and $d_K(x)$ divide each other, they only differ by a scalar factor. Lemma 2: Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials with $g(0) \neq 0$. Then, for all but finitely many $t$, the polynomials $f(tx)$ and $g(x)$ have no common factor. Proof: Let $f(x) = f_m x^m + \cdots + f_1 x + f_0$ and $g(x) = g_n x^n + \cdots + g_1 x + g_0$. If $f(tx)$ and $g(x)$ HAVE a nontrivial common factor, then there are polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$, of degrees $\leq n-1$ and $\leq m-1$, such that $$f(tx) p(x)=g(tx) q(x).$$ This is $m+n$ linear equations on the $m+n$ coefficients of $p$ and $q$. Writing this out in coefficients, the matrix $$\begin{pmatrix} f_m t^m & \cdots & f_1 t & f_0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & f_m t^m & \cdots & f_1 t & f_0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ \ddots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & f_m t^m & \cdots & f_1 t & f_0 \\ g_n & \cdots & g_1 & g_0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & g_n & \cdots & g_1 & g_0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ \ddots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & g_n & \cdots & g_1 & g_0 \end{pmatrix}$$ has nontrivial kernel. The determinant of this matrix is a polynomial in $t$, with leading term $(f_m)^n (g_0)^n t^{mn} + \cdots$. (Recall that $g_0 \neq 0$.) So, for all but finitely many $t$, this matrix has nonzero determinant and $f(tx)$ and $g(x)$ are relatively prime. QED. Now, we prove the primitive element theorem (for infinite fields). Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$, in $K$, be algebraic and separable over $F$, with minimal polynomials $f$ and $g$. We will show that, for all but finitely many $t$ in $F$, we have $F(\alpha - t \beta) = F(\alpha, \beta)$. Let $f(x) = (x -\alpha) f'(x -\alpha)$ and $g(x) = (x - \beta) g'(x - \beta)$. Since $\beta$ is separable, we know that $g'(0) \neq 0$. Note that $f'$ and $g'$ have coefficients in $K$. By Lemma 2, for all but infinitely many $t$ in $F$, the polynomials $f'(ty)$ and $g'(y)$ have no common factor. Choose a $t$ for which no common factor exists. Set $F' = F(\alpha - t \beta)$; our goal is to show that $F'=F(\alpha, \beta)$. Set $h_t(x) = f(tx + \alpha-t \beta)$. Note that $h_t(x)$ has coefficients in $F'$. We consider the GCD of $h_t(x)$ and $g(x)$. Working in $K$, we can write $h_t(x) = t (x - \beta) f'(t (x- \beta))$ and $g(x) = (x-\beta) g'(x-\beta)$. By the choice of $t$, the polynomials $f'(t (x- \beta))$ and $g'(x-\beta)$ have no common factor, so the GCD of $h_t(x)$ and $g(x)$, in the ring $K[x]$, is $x-\beta$. By Lemma 1, this shows that $x - \beta$ is in the ring $F'[x]$. In particular, $\beta$ is in $F'$. Clearly, $\alpha$ is then also in $F'$, as $\alpha= (\alpha - t \beta) + t \beta$. We have never written down an element of any field larger than $K$. QED. 

I first prove the upper bound $\mu \leq \tfrac{1}{\log 4}$. Fix a positive integer $r$. For $0 \leq k \leq r-1$, let $N_k$ be $2^{k/r} N$ rounded to the nearest integer, where $N$ is a large parameter. Considering the $N_{r-1}$ intervals present at time $N_{r-1}$, let $X_k$ be the number of them created between times $X_{k-1}$ and $X_k$; with $X_0$ the number created before time $0$. Then $$X_0 \frac{\mu}{N_0} + X_1 \frac{\mu}{N_1} + \cdots + X_{r-1} \frac{\mu}{N_{r-1}} \leq 1.$$ Set $S_k=X_0+X_1+\cdots +X_k$; we can rewrite the above equation as $$\mu \left( S_0 \left(\frac{1}{N_0} - \frac{1}{N_1}\right) + S_1 \left(\frac{1}{N_1} - \frac{1}{N_2} \right) + \cdots + S_{r-2} \left(\frac{1}{N_{r-2}} - \frac{1}{N_{r-1}}\right) + S_{r-1} \frac{1}{N_{r-1}} \right) \leq 1.$$ Now, $S_k$ is the number of those intervals present at final time $N_{r-1}$ which were created before time $N_k$, so we have $S_k \geq N_k - (N_{r-1} - N_k)=2 N_k - N_{r-1}$. The coefficient $\tfrac{1}{N_k} - \tfrac{1}{N_{k+1}}$ on the left hand side is positive, so we have $$\mu \left( (2N_0-N_{r-1}) \left(\frac{1}{N_0} - \frac{1}{N_1}\right)+ (2N_1-N_{r-1}) \left(\frac{1}{N_1} - \frac{1}{N_2}\right)+\cdots+ (2N_{r-2}-N_{r-1}) \left(\frac{1}{N_{r-2}} - \frac{1}{N_{r-1}}\right)+\frac{N_{r-1}}{N_{r-1}} \right) \leq 1.$$ We gather terms with the same denominator to obtain $$\mu \left( \frac{2N_0-N_{r-1}}{N_0} + \frac{2 N_1 - 2 N_0}{N_1} + \cdots + \frac{2 N_{r-1} - 2 N_{r-2}}{N_{r-1}} \right) \leq 1$$ or $$\mu \left( 2r - \frac{N_{r-1}}{N_0} - \frac{2 N_0}{N_1} - \cdots - \frac{2 N_{r-2}}{N_{r-1}} \right) \leq 1.$$ Plugging in our optimized values: $$\mu \left( 2r - r 2^{(r-1)/r} \right) \leq 1$$ so $$\mu \leq \frac{1}{2r (1-2^{-1/r})}.$$ Finally, taking the limit as $r \to \infty$ gives $\mu \leq \tfrac{1}{\log 4}$ as promised. 

So Nathan's paper may be the first reference for this fact in print. See Theorem 6.2 for the fact that the quotient map is a map of lattices and 6.5 for the fact that the inclusion is a map of lattices. Nathan writes that, for the Tamari lattice, the result about the inclusion is already in Bj√∂rner and Wachs. The goal of Nathan (and later my) work is to define a similar sub-and-quotient lattice story for any Coxeter group and any orientation of the Dynkin diagram; the Tamari lattice corresponds to $A_{n-1}$ with all arrows oriented in the same direction. If we stay in $S_n$ but look at other orientations of the Dynkin diagram, we get other posets whose Hasse diagrams are all various orientations of the $1$-skeleton of the associahedron. See sections 4-6 of Reading's linked paper for what this construction does in type A. 

I had earlier read the question as asking whether every conjugacy class in an infinite irreducible Coxeter group was infinite. My answer to that remains below. Thanks to Swiat Gal for pointing out the misreading. This is not true; the class of a translation in an affine group provides a counterexample. The simplest such counterexample is the group generated by $a$ and $b$ subject to $a^2=b^2=1$. The conjugacy class of $ab$ is $\{ ab, ba \}$, as you can verify by seeing that $a (ab) a^{-1} = b (ab) b^{-1} = ba$ and $a (ba) a^{-1} = b (ba) b^{-1} = ab$. Geometrically, one can think of this as the group of maps $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ of the form $x \mapsto \pm x + k$, for $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. The generators $a$ and $b$ are $x \mapsto -x$ and $x \mapsto -x+1$. More generally, every affine Coxeter group is of the form $W_0 \ltimes \mathbb{Z}^r$ for some finite group $W_0$. If you take a group element of the form $(e, v)$ with $v$ a nonzero element of $\mathbb{Z}^r$, its conjugacy class will be $\{ (e, gv): g \in W_0 \}$, which is finite. Geometrically, you should think of this as the group of maps $\mathbb{R}^r \to \mathbb{R}^r$ of the form $x \mapsto gx+v$ where $v$ ranges through $\mathbb{Z}^r$ and $g$ ranges through a finite subgroup $W_0$ of $GL_r$. Then the conjugacy class of a translation $x \mapsto x+v$ is finite. 

Suppose that $X = \mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1 \setminus \Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the diagonal. The Picard group of $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Yanking out $\Delta$ should just kill the generator $(1,1)$ in $\mathbb{Z}^2$, so $\mathrm{Pic}(X)$ should be $\mathbb{Z}$. So there is an infinite discrete parameter describing line bundles on $X$. Unless I am missing something... 

Writing $\int_{x=0}^{2 \pi} \sin x dx$ rather than $\int_0^{2 \pi} \sin x dx$ can be very useful when there are integrals stacked several layers deep. EG $$\int_{x=-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{y=-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-(x^2+y^2)/(2 \sigma)} dx dy = \int_{r=0}^{\infty} \int_{\theta=0}^{2 \pi} e^{-r^2/(2 \sigma)} r dr d\theta.$$
