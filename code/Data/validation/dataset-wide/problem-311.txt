How can you be certain that a person is choosing to die truly of their own free will, rather than because someone wants them out of the way? Is the old CEO really choosing to end his life on a high note, or has his scheming VP tricked/coerced him into it? Is the old lady dying because she doesn't want to live any more, or because her son wants to inherit the house? Does this person really have terminal cancer, or did their doctor lie to them to get a buzz? How can you be certain the person understands what they're doing? Did this child truly understand what 'dying' means? Did this teenager just want to show off to their crush? Is this person suffering from depression which will respond to treatment, are they in a low point that will resolve naturally if they wait? Is this person suffering from delusions that lead them to make a bad decision? How cheap is human life? Even when we grant someone the right to end their life, should it really be possible to do it casually? Death is the final, irrevocable choice; shouldn't every other option be explored before that is even considered? 'Stringent' security checks like fingerprinting aren't anything like enough - the process should be long and drawn out, with opportunities to withdraw at every step, right up to the moment of actual death. 

No social mobility You've basically set up a caste system, in which it is possible to drop to lower castes but impossible to climb to a higher one. The upper echelons will be filled with those who have a complete formal education, and they'll be the ones setting the rules. Below them are the less educated, all the way down. The Degradation of Education Essentially, education is going to become totally irrelevant. Under a system like this, those at the top are not going to want their children to fail, so they'll actually end up modifying education to fit the students rather than to reflect reality. Formal education will become rigid and formalised, just a set of rote principles to be memorised. Recovery The thing is, you can't really run a technological society like that (I'm assuming it's a technological society, from the structure proposed). People would learn on the job, as apprentices, or they'd learn but not get certifications, just 'letters of recommendation' from their teachers. The growth of education in the real world has been for practical reasons as much as for social ones. It became more important for workers to understand what they were doing, and mindless manual labour has become less and less important. That means that whatever the social construct behind it, if you have a technological society there will always been a fundamental need for a real education system. If the formal system is not accessible to those who need it, they'll create their own informal system, separate from the formal one. Long term In fact, and I'm just realising this as I type, you've set up a perfect situation for the formation of Morlocks and Eloi. You'd have one group with a very practical but informal and unstructured education, and another group with an education in more and more irrelevant 'classics' in theoretical charge. 

There's no biological reason that multiple sexes couldn't exist, but there are biological reasons to expect only two sexes in most situations. It can be tricky enough for a male to find a female to mate with, throwing in another factor as well could make reproduction harder. This is a concept that's been explored a number of times in sci-fi already. My favourite is The Gods Themselves by Asimov, which describes a species in another universe that consists of three sexes which mate by 'melting' into a single entity, with one impregnating another while the third provides the energy for the process. EDITED TO ADD: With the clarification of what we're looking for - a species with five sexes, and each individual having three of them - it's hard to imagine how such a species could possibly evolve. It's just too complex and requires too much careful control over getting individuals together to breed. We'd need a reason for why such a quirky system emerged, and that reason is likely to inform the social structures as well. It's also going to depend a lot on what these five 'sexes' actually do, biologically speaking. It also seems very likely that these organisms would be able to change part of their sexual equipment, the way some complex animals can on earth, to suit their surroundings. That's going to change things as well. We could imagine something of a caste system in place; rather than having fairly soft gender roles, as most human societies have, we might see that an individual is fitted into a caste and lives and operates according to those rules. We might find that all individuals are born with the arrangement of, say, 1, 2, 3, and start out in the lowest caste, doing manual labour. Those who rise to the top of the social strata in that caste might find themselves morphing into 2, 3, 4s, and able to climb to the next caste. Or perhaps those who are particularly prone to fighting will become 2, 3, 4s, while those who gain social rank by negotiation would become 1, 3, 4s, and those who learn their way out might be 1, 2, 4s, and each would change into the appropriate caste (Soldiers, Leaders, Scientists). Repeat for each new level, until you have a single 5 at the top of everything. 

You could take a look at the novel Small Gods, by Terry Pratchett. It takes a satirical look at such a situation, where one religion believes that only their god is real, and that all other gods are either fictional or demonic. Islam in the real world has similar features, particularly in the form of Jinn. Jinn are sentient creatures who can be good, evil, or neutral. An Islam-analogue in a world that actually does contain gods might explain those other gods as being Jinn that have tricked humans into worshipping them. Another approach might be that used by J.R.R. Tolkien. In the Tolkien legendarium, there is a creator deity named Eru or Illuvatar. This deity then created powerful spirits to be with him in the void; after the creation of the physical world, some of those spirits entered the world to build it and manage it on behalf of Eru. These were the Valar. The Silmarillion explicitly states that Men have often worshipped the Valar as gods - indeed, they were specifically created to be equivalent to the gods of European polytheism. Your world could have a similar belief system, whether well-founded or not, that believes that there is an overarching creative force, and that the other gods of the world are just this force's agents. 

There's a reason we use archaeology to reconstruct what happened in the past. Written records are powerful when they exist, but they're also fragile. It takes relatively little damage for a document written on paper to become illegible; stone lasts longer, depending on the environment, but it's so laborious to carve that you'd only keep your most important records engraved in stone. In a survival situation, you have much more important things to do than record the name and location of your homeworld. Unless your people maintain an industrial civilisation, and are able to devote extensive resources to recording their past and preserving those records, it's perfectly feasible for knowledge of the past to be lost. 

The Matrix idea is by far the best. However... Hook up their ship's life support to standard residential blocks Per Coalition Guideline #87923, section 7, all ships planning to dock with Coalition space stations are recommended to carry standard 273-pin life support interface connections that meet or exceed Guideline Specification #28447. This equipment will allow your ship to connect to an Astralsquadron-standard Reconfigurable Station Environment, and provide the same environmental conditions you enjoy aboard your ship within your station quarters. Using your own ship to provide the life support in your A.R.S.E. ensures that you can enjoy comfortable living conditions during your time on the station. All A.R.S.E.s are equipped to move independently around the station, allowing meetings between vastly different species to take place in comfort, simply by pressing their A.R.S.E.s together. 

Your people might do well to look into hydroponics. I don't know exactly what resources your group have available, but if I were planning something like this, I'd want a high-tech, self-contained habitat. Wind, solar, possibly nuclear power, running a hydroponic vertical farm, possibly in a cave system or abandoned mine system. Having that kind of setup would allow them much greater flexibility in location, sidestepping the uncertainty and unpredictability of climate change. Second possibility - aquaculture. A seaborne city would have the greatest flexibility of location, and would be able to farm phytoplankton and algae to keep a sizeable population fed. Untying from the land means that climate change is little more than a nuisance. 

If the gods are opposed to one another, or involved in shifting alliances and plots against one another, chances are they're going to cancel one another out. Is the advice we're getting from the God of Rain better or worse than the advice from the God of Wind? Is the God of the Sea telling us to build ships because that's really the best option, or because he's having a bit of a tiff with the Goddess of the Plains? If I seek to placate the God of Wine, my barley harvest gets destroyed by the God of Beer. That kind of thing. A theocracy would make sense if the gods are working together, or if they rule clearly defined territories. If the Great God Andy is dominant in the plains, a theocracy on the plains would work well - but probably not if they're in the mountains, where the Great God Bill holds sway. 

So, if I'm understanding correctly, you're wondering how to prevent a catastrophic failure on a space station from creating debris that would be hazardous to other stations? If so, there are a few options: 1) Failure Points This is a development of a technology commonly used on aircraft to minimise the effect of a crack in the skin of the aircraft. The skin of the aircraft is built with deliberate weak points, so if there's a failure at any one point, the entire panel will break out. This prevents the damage from spreading beyond that point. In our space station attack scenario, your station would be built from modules designed to come apart under stress. Thus rather than the explosion ripping metal into thousands of sharp splinters, it would produce a few hundred soft-edged squares. 2) Catch the debris before it leaves I don't remember where I saw this - it was ages ago, when I was a kid, and it was only a brief mention. In brief, it talked about dealing with the problem of space junk by requiring any orbiter to deploy a large gel disc, spin-stabilised, near the ship. The idea was that any junk or debris that was jettisoned by the ship would be trapped in the gel instead of flying off who-knows-where. This isn't perfect, of course, since it only protects against debris in a narrow band, but you could add a couple of discs around the structure. 3) Make your ship out of non-shatter materials This is kind of a sub-set of 1), but distinct enough for its own page. Different materials react to explosions in different ways. By building your ship from something that does not break up into fragments in a blast - largely plastics - or coating them in such materials - like, say, Line X - you can ensure that while the contents of the station may be destroyed, the debris is manageable. 

1 Ceres is 965 km across, much larger than either Death Star. This is 2 Pallas, the third most massive body in the asteroid belt: 

Fireballs Ultimately, at the root of almost every form of power production that our technology relies upon is the ability to produce localised heat. Whether we produce this heat with coal, oil, natural gas, or the fission of unstable elements, it's all the same concept. We produce electricity by generating heat, using the heat to convert water into steam, and using the steam to drive a turbine. We smelt metals by mixing ore and flux with something to produce a lot of heat; normally that's coal, but other sources of heat work just as well. If you have some clean, reliable form of magical fire, you can reproduce most of the technology that you and me use routinely. Even if all you can do is heat a boiler, that can produce electricity, and electricity can be harnessed to do almost anything - including producing even greater heat! 

You'd need some kind of documentation of the discovery that didn't travel through time with you. It sounds as though, for some inexplicable reason, you didn't bother taking any precautions for normal, forseeable events like storms, floods, and rips in the space/time continuum, so I doubt you have a safe deposit box at a bank or similar. You might be able to find your old safe with your original recipe and notes in it, if your rival didn't use his treacherous minions to track it down while he twirled his mustache; these would be ideal. You may also be able to find something in a bureaucratic organization's archives. Lawyers, for example, could well have kept very old correspondence. Even if you can prove your claim, however, don't count on easy riches. The Peanut Butter Cabal is powerful, and you'd have to prove not only that you invented it, but that you are the same person as the one in the documents. Since peanut butter was patented in 1884, and you have no doubt been declared legally dead in the mean time, you're not likely to get anyone to accept you as the true inventor of peanut butter. Also, even if you prove your case, it's likely to get you no more than a quiet mention in the history books. Look up the case of Antonio Meucci, who claimed to have invented the telephone. His work was done long before Alexander Graham Bell's 'invention', but he was unable to afford the fee to maintain his copyright on the invention. When it lapsed, Bell snatched it up and filed his own patent. Even today, after the US Congress has passed a resolution effectively recognizing Meucci as the inventor of the telephone, his name is little more than a footnote in history.
