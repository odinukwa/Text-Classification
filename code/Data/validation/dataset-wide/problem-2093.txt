My Advice? Take a hedging strategy. Treat your knowledge like an investment. Get some depth in a promising field, but don't lose focus on learning other, sometimes completely unrelated things. Invest 60% depth and 40% breadth or 40/60, not 100% one or the other. Technology is way too fast moving to put all your eggs in one basket. But its also stable enough that many problems do stay around and linger. You want to not get too comfortable in one cushy, well paying gig, only to have that problem become obsolete with nothing to fall back on. 

Is my local area's job market sufficient such that there are multiple jobs at my desired level of "depth". Can I find another job in my chosen subfield easily? Or will it take a lot of work? Do I want to stay focussed on the same problem my whole career, getting a very deep understanding and learning multiple ways to solve that problem, or do I want to always be learning new, disparate things even if its only surface level? Where do I want to be in that spectrum? Do I want to command a higher salary, even if it means taking longer to find the job that best fits me? Or will I be ok on a smaller salary but more stability? 

Well the correct answer is both! If you could be very broad and very deep, and know everything wouldn't you? Alas though, even geniuses have their limits. So we have to chose what skills we are going to grow vs those we're going to sacrifice. Generally it boils down to how much of a commodity you're going to be. With a lot of breadth, you will always be marketable with a large skillset. You have more opportunities. However, as your skills are mostly surface skills, you will be more commoditized. That is to say, with more supply, eventually the salaries drive lower as the odds increase there's someone who can write that iPhone app for $30/hour where you want to charge $32/hour. The extreme example of "breadth" is manual labor which everyone can do and is very heavily commoditized. With depth, the opportunities are scarcer. However, with deep knowledge you are competing in a smaller workforce. You'll likely be able to demand more $$ for your work as there are only a few people with those skills. You're not a commodity. The ultimate example of all-depth is someone with a PhD. You are so focused on a single problem that somebody may pay you through the nose to help solve that problem. You may, however, have problems finding the handful of people desperate to solve that subproblem. Depth can also be more brittle, the problem you're solving may pretty much be solved one day, making your job obsolete. You have to find what balance is most appropriate to you between "manual laborer" and "PhD student". Software Engineer is already some level of depth as obviously not everyone can do it. But do you want to be deeper than that? I'd take some things into account: 

So I am in my early 30s and live in Florida. I have a BS degree in a IT field and have about 3 years of experience working since I graduated. I am also a honorably discharged veteran. I was the top employee at the 2 jobs I have worked at since graduated and am extremely driven and want to devote all my efforts to my job as I started late in the game and went in the military - did not graduate until I was around 30. I did interview over the phone and was told to come in next day as they wanted me for the position and thought I was the best applicant by a long shot. I started working as a consultant and worked for about 5 days. The pay is not that good - at least since it is only a few dollars more than my previous job. Although I am a very good worker and have not had any issues in either previous jobs I do have arrests from when 5-6 years ago. I had multiple DUI charges and a few minor charges (all misdemeanors) and nothing related to theft or anything that would say that I am not honest or a bad person etc. My credit is also not that good and I am working to get that improved as I did not realize how important the score is until getting out of the service and not being as responsible with payments/credit as I should have. Anyways, I was given a pretty large list of tasks and was working each day for many hours even though it was originally stated as a part time position. However, the day after I signed the form for a background check, I spoke to the person who hired me, and they said to not come in until the next week (4 days) as they were going to be out of the country. I have also been in contact with another employee in the office and they seem the same as when I had been working in the office with them. I am very worried at this point as I just sensed it odd that there was alot of tasks they wanted done ASAP and most were in the office - and then when asking if I should go into the office to work on these tasks for the next few work days, they said to just come in at the start of next week. The last thing I have heard is from the other person in the office who is still very nice and helpful and said to contact the person who hired me (main person in charge below owners) at the start of the next working week at a certain time early in the morning to see when they wanted me to come in again. Sorry for long post - I tend to write alot, but I would like any feedback if anyone takes the time to read my situation. Thanks for your time if you did read this post. I just found this site and will spend some time reading other similar situations if I can find them on here. -A Concerned new employee who just started a great job and worried I may be let go already even though I have not done anything wrong on the job 

In my experience, in start up culture, all nighters or staying late happens. Things come up and they need to be dealt with. It is nothing special. That's why I wouldn't put it on my resume; it is nothing special. 

If you are interviewing with a small company (start up), show up dead on time. There is no receptionist, you will cause disturbance if you show up early. Don't walk into a company space 5 minutes early; it is too early. Some small companies have shared lobbies, and you can be as early as you want, because your contact will come to pick you up when they are ready, that's a different story. 

It might actually turn out that the candidate had very few managerial duties and for most part was a developer. As many people stated already don't read into the titles too much. I was a "Head of" at a very small company, but I for most part was the only person on the team with nobody under me. 

You don't have to ask this question directly. Unless candidate's resume explicitly states that it was a managerial role. 

If there is a useful tool that his not using point him to it. I am certainly biased to text editors, and tried to write scala in vim, but I was quickly pointed to IntelliJ, and even though, it has different mindset, and somewhat of a learning curve; I am much more productive with it. Therefore, point him to the best tools you think he misses. Don't force him to use it, just suggest him to try it. If he refuses to even try, that's a red flag to me, looks like a hard person to work with. If he tries it, but is not more productive with it, then you will at least understand why he is so "old skool", some people get confused by easy to use interfaces, I am a bit like that. Maybe you can put him on tasks where there is user interface to work with?
