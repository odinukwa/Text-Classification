[This turned out to be quite long question, but I couldn't find anyone discussing my particular situation - long, training-like ride followed by a workday as a developer. It seems that all considerations are intertwined.] A bit of current situation: My company is moving (in 1-1.5 months) to new offices that will have shower facilities and that made me consider cycling to work. I'm 189cm (6'2") high weighing ~120kg (265lbs). 10 years ago, I commuted 12km (7.5mi) for a short-term work, at the time weighing ~105kg (230lbs). Started with a 47 minute ride and got down to 18 minutes after 3 weeks (average speed of 40kph or ~25mph). That was on a 70's-era steel road bike with shifters on down tube (don't recall the maker). The primary goal is to get in shape, while enjoying monetary savings in fuel costs and possibly a shorter commute (time-wise, more on that later). The ride will be about 30km between two cities. It will consist of 6km/3.7mi fast (3 lanes) city road (60kph/37mph allowed, 80-90kph/50-55mph actual speeds); followed by ~20km/12.5mi of highway with shoulders and high congestion, avg. speeds of 25kph/15.5mph most of the span; ending in 4km/2.5mi of "slow" city traffic. Elevation is negligible. Weather is mostly hot, with temperatures in the 30-40C/85-105F range with 90+ percent humidity for about 6 months of the year, and about 25-30 rainy days. I won't cycle in rain/extremely windy weather. The first consideration: I know it will take several months of training before I can make that ride, and I'm planning to light up as a Christmas tree for safety/visibility. Considering that, do you think that this plan is insane and I should drop the whole idea? Can you elaborate as to why? Regarding bike setup (from my research and budget): [I know my weight is usually on the top or over-the-top of the range for most appliances (e.g. Segway and most electric bikes are rated to 115kg max.). I haven't seen any restriction for rider weight in specs, but that maybe because there are not a lot of people with that weight buying this level of bikes?] Bike: I'm inclined towards mainly because all reviews praise its comfort for long rides and its rigidity. Now, I'm not sure what constitutes a "long" ride - maybe the reviewers are talking about 100km/60mi rides and for my intended purposes another bike will be more suitable? Pedals: I'm thinking of Shimano's 105 (PD-5700, steel not carbon) with SH-11 cleats due to praises of durability from reviews. The wider plate should be better for me considering my weight. Am I right about these? Should I consider something else? Better? Can I get by with something cheaper (i.e. PD-R540)? Is 6 degrees of float is enough for such long rides? Fork / Saddle / Brakes / Crank / Gears / Handlebars / Shifters / Wheels: Stock from Felt. Is there something that i should definitely change/upgrade? Helmet, Lights and Water Bottle: I'd get whatever is in the shop and fits me in size and price. Are there any essentials like air pump or tube fixing kit that I have to get? Now, for the logistics part: The biggest concern is how to go about bringing clothes for changing. 

I'd like to put cross (interrupter) brake levers on my drop-bar tourer, but I also like to use a bar bag. There is about 55 mm of space between my bars and the bar bag, measured horizontally. Will cross top levers (and my hands, in order to operate them!) fit comfortably in this space? I'm also aware that most people have their cross levers angled downwards, which thankfully must reduce the amount of horizontal clearance they require. What angle would you recommend for this? 

I think you could consider using the same argument but for the bike, not the car. Instead of "tax, insurance, petrol, ...", it becomes "bike, accessories, maintenance, ..." This assumes someone spends more than a pittance in the first place, but in my experience (living in a city where people typically start commuting by bike for the first time after moving here) this is quite typical anyway: people start off with a basic bike and helmet and lights, then they realise they need better lights, oh and a better jacket, oh and now it's winter so I need cold-weather clothing, oh and maybe a nicer bike isn't such a bad idea... etc etc. Of course, it's fairly unlikely that someone will invest more in absolute terms in their bike than in their car. But I'd argue all is not lost, thanks to (weird? illogical?) human psychology. What matters is not the absolute cost, but the cost relative to expectations. Say I have a $5k car and a $1k bike+accessories. Relative to other cars, the car is fairly cheap; relative to other bikes, the bike is fairly expensive. So, in a sense, I have invested more in my bike than my car. The other way in which I feel invested in my bike is that it takes more maintenance on my part than a car. If I have a problem with my car, I take it to the garage and forget about it. If I have a problem with my bike or it simply needs routine maintenance, I'll put in the time and effort myself. Hence, again, you can reframe the original argument: "I have invested more blood, sweat and tears into my bike than into my car." Personally, in my case, I also spent a lot more time choosing my bike than my car. And finally, I invested a lot of time in building up my fitness for bike-commuting, and I don't want to lose that. These are yet other ways in which I feel more invested in my bike than my car.
