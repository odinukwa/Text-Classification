(1) is "conative", though strictly speaking, it's not an aspectual category, since it's about more than just the temporal structure of the event. I don't know if there's a term for (2) (and I'm not actually sure exactly what you mean; some more examples might help). 

We know that Greek doesn't allow a syllable to begin with a geminate, because if it did, there should be words where this occurs initially (e.g. *ττα) or after a consonant (e.g. *γλῶρττα), and such words don't exist. Vowels followed by a geminate make a heavy (a.k.a. "long") syllable, as can be seen from their scansion in poetry. E.g. in Iliad 1.3 πολλὰς δ’ ἰφθίμους ψυχὰς Ἄϊδὶ προΐαψεν, the first syllable must be heavy to satisfy the meter, so we know it's πολ- not πο-. A similar, non-metrical source of evidence is the comparatives and superlatives of o-stem adjectives, whose form varies according to the weight of the preceding syllable: -ότερος/-ότατος after a heavy syllable, -ώτερος/-ώτατος after a light syllable. Adjectives with a geminate before the -o- take the former set: περιττός, περιττότερος, περιττότατος. This shows that the syllabification is πε.ριτ.τός not πε.ρι.ττός. 

SV is a verb-second pattern: as jlawler says in his comment, the subject is a constituent, so the verb is in second position. Anyone who uses the term "verb-second" would agree with this, I believe. The Wikipedia page you link to actually gives examples of SV order as a type of verb-second order: e.g. the very first example, from German, which it says "illustrates the V2 principle": Die Kinder spielten Fussball vor der Schule im Park. Maybe what misled you is that that page says that English has moved from a V2 to a broadly SV order, which might be taken to suggest that SV is something entirely different from V2. But the point is that SV, as the most frequent type of V2, has become the basic unmarked word order in English, while other types of V2 -- in which the verb was preceded by e.g. an adverb, a PP, or an object, and the subject then followed the verb -- have mostly fallen out of use. 

To answer your second question first -- yes, in the combination γγ the first gamma is always pronounced as a nasal, e.g. ἄγγελος angelos (not aggelos). To the question in your title, no, there is no dialectal interchange of κκ~γγ, and I can't think of any Greek word that shows such variation. I have no explanation for the origin of the gg in coggygria, but note that the form coccygria also gets some Google hits. 

@fdb's answer addresses the Indo-Iranian forms, so this one will address the Greek and Latin ones. In Greek, there are two relevant sets of sound changes: 

Future: Si aedificabis, venient "If you build it, they will come." Future perfect: Si aedificaveris, venient "If you will have built it, they will come." 

Technically, the answer to your question is that was is a preterite indicative, because mood and tense are categories of verb form, not semantics. But you're right that this is an unusual use of the indicative: was seems to be intended as semantically counterfactual, equivalent to would have been. I believe that Gibbon has calqued this usage from Latin and Greek, both of which can use the indicative in a similar way. Normally, in both Latin and Greek the apodosis (then-clause) of a counterfactual condition is marked by something other than a plain indicative (subjunctive in Latin, counterfactual particle ἄν in Greek). But in both languages one occasionally finds a plain indicative instead, e.g.: 

There are hundreds of distinct languages in India, from two main families, Dravidian and Indo-European. Malayalam is Dravidian and Hindi is Indo-European, so they are not only different languages but unrelated ones. All the major languages of India have borrowed extensively from Sanskrit, hence the lexical similarities you mention; but this doesn't make them dialects of the same language, any more than the fact that the Hebrew for "telephone" is telefon makes Hebrew a dialect of English. 

Many or most Indic languages possess voiceless aspirated stops. Cross-linguistically, such stops often turn into fricatives: e.g., in Indo-European, this happened in Greek, in Iranian, and probably in the prehistory of Latin. There are dozens or perhaps hundreds of Indic languages, and they've possessed voiceless aspirates for millennia, so you'd think many of them should have undergone this sound change. 

The answer seems to be no. Asko Parpola, in his chapter on the Indus script in Daniels and Bright's The World's Writing Systems (1996), says: "it has no obvious genetic affinity with any other known script... There is no connection whatsoever with the earliest scripts of historical South Asia, Brahmi and Kharoshthi, which were created on the basis of Semitic and Greek alphabets". (Note that the last sentence implies that the "two primary lineages" you mention are really one lineage, though the question of the exact relationship between them, if any, is still debated.) 

To answer (1): in Greek, geminates syllabify across a syllable boundary, so the first syllable is closed, e.g. γλῶτ.τα. We know this for two reasons: 

These are all normal Greek characters. C is a form of sigma: it's called lunate sigma, and is a variant that's sometimes used in printed texts these days too. Lunate sigma is a Hellenistic development which occurred in handwritten Greek (not specific to mosaics) for speed of writing. (It's also the origin of the Cyrillic C for [s].) In ΔIOCΠωΛIC the omega must be a spelling mistake: at this period Greek no longer distinguished the sound of omega (originally [ɔː]) from that of omicron ([o]), and such confusions are common. The two epsilons in "Bethlehem" look almost the same to me; one's a bit more rounded, but that's well within the usual range of shape variation in pre-print era texts. The lowercase-uppercase distinction would not arise for another several centuries. 

It is dissimilation, or more specifically loss by dissimilation. There are two [l] sounds in the word originally, and one of them dissimilates to zero, i.e. is lost. This is a common type of sound change. 

Which languages, if any, outside of Semitic have something like Semitic-style root-and-template morphology, with roots that can be analyzed as consisting of consonants only, and the vowels coming from a separate morphological tier? I've heard that some Native American languages have similar systems, but I don't know which. I realize that Germanic ablaut (for example) is a similar kind of phenomenon, but it's not basic to morphology in Germanic the way that it is in Semitic; I'm asking about languages where this is the basic strategy of verbal and/or nominal inflection. 

Your last question is a different issue, about sound changes in later Romance languages rather than about Latin itself. Most or all Latin vowels, not just E, underwent various changes in the various daughter languages. 

Copular clauses in English generally have a "Topic BE Focus" structure, rather than a "Focus BE Topic" structure. That is, the phrase that you're predicating something about precedes the copula; what you're predicating of that phrase follows the copula. In your example, you were predicating something about "the guy behind you", namely that you were mistaken as to his identity. You weren't predicating something about your wife (as you would have been if you had said "I thought you were behind me"). This raises the non-linguistic question, which I'm not sure how to answer, of why we cognitively frame cases of mistaken identity in this way rather than the reverse: after all, if you're wrong about the identity of X because you think it's Y, aren't you also wrong about the identity of Y? But that's not how we think about it. If you were asked "Whose identity were you mistaken about, in that scenario?" you would answer "The guy behind me", not "My wife". In a similar vein, your example 2b would be fine in a scenario (a weird one, but bear with me) where the boy has learned a wrong meaning for the word "mother", and thinks it means "any woman whose hand one happens to be holding". Describing that case you could, I think, perfectly well say 2b. This is because what the boy is mistaken about is (the meaning of) "his mother", so that goes into the Topic position, while in 2a what he is mistaken about is the identity of "the woman whose hand he was holding". 

Can anyone recommend a good comparative grammar of the Germanic languages -- or, failing that, good historical grammars specifically for Old English and Old Norse? Ideally, what I want is a historical grammar that gives a comparative overview of the Germanic languages from the Proto-Germanic period (or even from PIE). But since I'm mostly interested in Old English and Old Norse, specific historical grammars for those languages would be useful too. Preferably written in English, but any western European language is good. I have Prokosch's Comparative Germanic Grammar, but it's from 1939, and is obviously idiosyncratic in some of its views even for that period. I've read Ringe's recent monograph on Proto-Germanic, but that doesn't (yet) go beyond the PGmc stage. Suggestions? 

Does there exist a reliable, reasonably up-to-date historical-comparative grammar of Sanskrit written in English? Failing that, what are the standard works for historical Sanskrit phonology and morphology in other European languages? 

Deciding between a cluster analysis and a coarticulation analysis when the two do not phonemically contrast is always to some extent a matter of analytical choice, so there's no general answer to your question. Even in English at least one serious linguist has proposed that e.g. the initial cluster of a word like stop should be considered a single phoneme. Here are some possible factors that could influence your choice: 

If 1 is intended, what evidence is there that it's true? If 2 is intended, what is the point of such a set of algorithms, when what we really want is to understand the actual workings of the linguistic mind? 

It's mostly a matter of historical convention. The two transcription systems are roughly the same age, both from the late 19C, and IAST (I believe) is based on earlier, similar systems which preceded the IPA. The IPA itself only became something approaching a universal standard (though it still isn't quite that) sometime in the mid-20C, by which time IAST was firmly entrenched among Sanskrit scholars. Most Sanskritists aren't linguists and see no reason to change their transcription system, which would be a costly and confusing enterprise. Also, before the advent of computerized fonts it was easier to print IAST, which uses only Roman characters plus a small set of diacritics, than the IPA with its specialized characters. 

It's not correct to say that -que can only coordinate single words (nouns, adjectives, etc.); very often it coordinates whole phrases. Here, it's coordinating two phrases headed by the nominatives gaudens and aemula, both in apposition to altera. You could translate "the other flees, both delighting ... and emulating ...". 

English words in -tion/-sion are nouns because this suffix comes from Latin, where it was a productive way of forming action nouns. Some of these English nouns are borrowings directly from Latin, but this suffix has become productive in English too. (Some nouns on your list are from the same origin but borrowed through French, with a change in spelling and pronunciation, e.g. benison.) The class of words in -ism (and less frequently in -asm and -thm) comes from Greek, where -smos was a productive abstract noun formant. In this case too, -ism has become productive in English, so many words with this suffix don't have a Greek source (e.g. capitalism). Other than these two classes, I don't think there's really a pattern here; many of the other nouns you list are very rare, and I'm sure one could come up with a few verbs with similar endings to balance them. 

In languages that mark evidentiality morphologically, what evidential categories tend to be used for things like creation stories, myths, statements about theology ("God is good"), etc.? It would seem that "direct experience" evidentials (visual or other) would most likely not be used for such statements, but on the other hand, "inferential" or "hearsay"-type evidentials might not be appropriate either insofar as they imply lesser confidence, at least in cultures where such things are supposed to be known with certainty. This must be a problem that missionaries come up against all the time: what do SIL linguists do when they have to translate "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" into a language that has evidentials? I realize the answer to this question will be that different languages do different things, and that it will vary based on what evidential categories the language marks -- I'm interested in specific examples. 

What are the semantics of this construction? What constraints are there on the semantic role of the subject and its relationship to the action of the verb? For example, one constraint seems to be that the subject should be aware of the action: He had his car stolen, but he didn't realize it sounds strange to me. Also, it seems like the action has to be agentive (though the agent is someone other than the subject): He had his key lost is obviously bad. When and how did this construction arise? Is it historically an extension of the causative have construction? What other languages have similar constructions, i.e. ones that line up the subject with an "affectee" or "beneficiary" argument, and what do these look like morphosyntactically? (The "benefactive pivot" construction of some Philippine languages seems to be one example.) 

It's easy (though of course conjectural) to connect 3sg -t in verbs with the t- of the demonstrative pronoun, which (as I said in my comment) actually only has s- in the masc. and fem. nom. Then the questions become (1) whether this t- has anything to do with the 2sg pronoun tu, and (2) whether the 2sg verbal ending -s has anything to do with the s- of the masc./fem. nom. of the demonstrative pronoun. I suppose a semantic change from second person to third person or vice versa is not impossible, but I would wager that the answer to both questions is no, and the similarities are coincidental. 

This would be a fascinating project if it were feasible, but unfortunately it's well beyond the current state of knowledge about linguistic change; and even if we knew much more than we do, it's still possible that language would turn out to be too complex and ill-bounded a system to model at all adequately. We don't know enough about how, and especially why, language changes to be able to model it. For example, we know what kinds of sound changes are frequent in languages, but we don't know why they happen when they do in the languages that they do. We know morphological analogy happens, but we can't predict when it will happen and in what direction. Syntactic change is even more mysterious. Etc. Many of these phenomena have their roots in realms that are not (or not purely) linguistic, e.g. acoustics, sound perception, communicational pragmatics, or even random facts of cultural history, so you'd have to model all these as well. And language change arises from usage, not from the abstract structure of a language, so you'd have to model language use in all its contexts. Basically, you'd have to model a world. This is not to say that it's impossible to model very specific, limited aspects of language change. Adam Albright claims he has a model that successfully predicts the direction of analogical change given certain usage statistics. Probably there are other such small-scale attempts out there, which maybe others here can mention. But a general model of language change, unfortunately, is almost certainly more than a few decades away. 

The Proto-Indo-European "third laryngeal", *h3, is often assumed to have been a voiced sound based on the fact that some reflexes of the "drink" root *peh3- appear to show voicing assimilation of p to b: e.g. Sanskrit pibati < *pi-ph3-, Latin bibit similarly with further regressive assimilation. But whenever I've seen this argued, this "drink" verb is the only piece of evidence presented. Are there other words that show assimilatory voicing of a consonant next to *h3? It's true that *h3 seems to have been the least frequent of the laryngeals, but still, you'd think that more than one data point should be adducible for this process. 

It seems that none of these are objects, as witnessed by the fact that you can't raise them to be the subject of a passive clause: *A fool is considered Joe by Sue, *"Daddy-O" is called Joe by Sue, *200 pounds is/are weighed by Joe. What are their syntactic and semantic roles? I realize that 3 is a completely different kettle of fish than 1-2. My attempt at an answer for 1: it's a predicate in a verbless subordinate clause, cf. "Sue considers Joe to be a fool", with the same meaning and an explicit verb. (This procedure of analyzing the structure of a sentence S by means of a paraphrase S' isn't obviously valid to me, by the way, but I realize it's normal in syntax.) 2 looks similar enough that something along the same lines might work, but here you can't make the subordinate verb explicit (*Sue calls Joe to be "Daddy-O"). 3 is obviously something else entirely. "200 pounds" is a required argument of the verb (*Joe weighs), but syntactically not an object (apparently) and semantically not a patient or theme, so what is it?
