Personally I think you have somehow managed to tighten the outer bearing cup that is part of the freehub body. It has two notches on either side, take the cassette off and see if you can knock the notches back to let the freehub spin. If you have a Shimano hub you might want to also consider putting a new freehub body on there. These are LBS stocked parts albeit not an everyday request. The bearings in the freehub can survive a bit of abuse, so long as you don't get too much dirt in there so consider DiY and, if that fails, pop a new freehub body on. 

As everyone knows, Schwalbe Marathon series are the bullet-proof-most tyres known to cyclistkind, seems they do have some variants in the 2.00 uber-width: $URL$ 

I enjoy going up hills by bike and only the steepest Alps make me think 'what am I doing!!!' However, some of my friends have a tendency to say things like We're not going all the way up there, are we!?!' Just the sight of tarmac looming upwards can make them want to instantly dismount or take a longer, flatter route, or go back home, or phone mummy, or find a pub or something else defeatist. There also seems to be a common fixation on the top, which I don't understand. To me the top is not really of consequence (unless it is a famous mountain pass that I have not been to before). What is the best way to encourage others to get to the top? Edit: We are talking hills here, nothing particularly steep, nothing in extreme weather, perfectly averagely paved surface with light traffic. 

Shimano use a connecting pin for their 1/8" Nexus chains, for which you need a chain tool. As Neil notes, there is room for error popping these in and out. As you have discovered, the SRAM powerlink does not result in a practical solution - you cannot flex the chain enough. Therefore, the tried and tested 'buckle style' link is the desired solution. I have not known of these to fail, you can also obtain a chain with one even if you are in the back of beyond.

That will set you back a minor fortune and you will not be able to get it in your typical LBS. More commonly available at the LBS is the rack that bolts onto your seatpost. I have not tried one of these myself however I do know that they get knocked rather easily and can sway from side to side. Plus I think you can only carry ten kilograms or so with one. The market leader for such racks in the UK is Topeak. Here there is a lot to get right, they do gazillions of different models to suit different frame sizes and bike types. No disrespect to the product, but avoid if you can: 

Your local bike shop may not get it with fixed/single speed but do not discount them entirely. They can sometimes compete on price better than a mail order company simply because they will not be charging you shipping even if they have to get parts in specially for you. Most bike shops have at least a couple of regular suppliers and these suppliers will almost certainly have what you need. Also, there is always the option to get spare parts for a particular bike. If you like the wheel set that comes with a a e.g. Specialized Langster and the shop do Specialized then you can ask them to quote you for a replacement wheelset. The same goes with Kona/Giant or whatever it is they do stock. With some brands these replacement parts are surprisingly competitively priced. Give the local shop a go even if they do need extra prodding and, if they are any good, they will give you service that the online box-shifters never can. 

Ebay is going to be your friend here, another option you might want to investigate is center-pull. Sticking with Weinmann, here is the 999, seemingly available in short reach flavour: 

As noted you do the braking on the front wheel, particularly if really braking when your centre of gravity moves forward over the front wheel. Therefore, if you are going to have odd tyres, put the wider one up front. This will give you better braking and cornering. Tread matters little on-road for grip, even in the wet as bicycle tyres do not aquaplane. The main point of tread on a road tyre is to indicate wear. Too worn and the 'canvas' wears through and you get punctures. Odd tyres are to be expected, the back wears out quicker for mysterious reasons for which the physics has as yet to be disclosed on B-SE, therefore you should end up with odd tyres - if you don't then you are not riding hard enough. 

The fundamental problem with synthetic garments is that some of the fibres (particularly early nylon and current polyester) have spaces within the fibres that are perfect-sized cocoons for growing the bacteria that give rise to body odour. 'Boil wash' the garment to kill the bacteria and you damage the fabric. Cold-wash to look after the fabric and you don't kill the bacteria. It means you cannot win on a regular machine wash. As mentioned vinegar (an acid) works to kill the bacteria. The same goes with a domestic alkali such as baking soda. If this pre-wash is too much effort and you just want the bacteria killed then you can get TAED or 'oxy' add-in for your wash - same aisle as the regular washing powders, smaller packs. This works at low temperatures and with my clothes but there is no way in a million years that I would advise an 'Assos' garment (or equivalent) be washed with TAED. You can also invest in the base-layers that have silver particles embedded in them. These are up-market garments that cost a bit more but pay off in the no-smells department. Also of use is a dehumidifier, the DeLonghi DNC65 will work wonders in the changing room at work or at home in the winter months to purge moisture from the air where your clothing develops its pong. A lot of life's problems were solved with the DNC65 for me and my invariably damp cycle attire. The aim of the game is to not have the bacteria grow, it is therefore best to shower before riding to work (not at work) as fresh sweat does not smell - just the bacteria that develop 12 hours later (when you are home). Therefore, clean body and no bacteria gets transferred to the clothing - it stays that bit cleaner. I don't think anything can be done with cheaper fabrics that get infested with bacteria - a good set of quality items, washed as per the instructions and kept scrupulously dry in-between rides with a bit of 'oxy' added to the wash is the best strategy. You also want to avoid merely disguising smells - the deodorant strategy - as that does not really work. 

Cleaning a bike with high pressure water is relatively tame and only mildly morally wrong if you really do not know what you are doing. A lot more fun can be had with a diesel powered steam cleaner where the water-cleaning-solution-mix comes out at a toasty 150 degrees centigrade and the 'wand' has to be held with both hands due to the 'recoil'. Pass the 'wand' over the three main tubes of a bicycle and you can sometimes pull off the stickers in one smooth motion. Stick a 1980's Peugeot racing bike in the way of the 'wand' and you can get down to bare steel. (Temperature dial has to be adjusted for Peugeot and Halfords own-brand bikes). Put the bike upside down and well supported so it does not get instantly blown over by the onslaught of water and point the 'wand' at the wheels, in next to no time they spin at a very fast rate and every speck of grease and grime gets to be washed away. A quick point at the hubs and they are in as-new appearance. The same goes for the chain, even the most encrusted chain gets to be denuded of all lubricants in seconds. Handlebar tape - same again, back to as new except for cuts and holes. Most of the bikes I washed so environmentally-unfriendily were customer repairs or part-exchanges to be sold on as second hand bikes. A thorough inspection was given afterwards and areas needing oil/GT85 were treated accordingly. The oily-rag was used for the Allen-key bolts and other steel nuts where the chrome surface was likely to be damaged. A quick polish and the appearance was so much better than achievable by other means. I did test-ride many of the bikes 'abused' by industrial cleaning methods and we also had customer feedback. On one or two occasions I did inadvertently get water into the bottom bracket or freewheel, this was not the problem though, it was dirt forced in that was the problem. I learned through trial and error not to assault such areas and to give the Peugeot models an easier time due to that water-soluble-paint problem they had. Not once did we ever get a customer complaint, people were always very pleased with getting their bikes back looking as good as new. Would I put my own bike under the 'wand' of the steam cleaner? Most definitely, even my retro-Campagnolo road bike (that has no sealed bearings). The 150 degree water would heat the frame/components so that on a summer's day it would be dry in a matter of minutes with not a speck of dirt left behind. The air + water + steel combination needed for rust to bloom was therefore kept to the absolute minimum of time. My bikes did not rust prematurely or have mystery rattles from the freehub or bottom bracket area. As a consequence of having cleaned the bike so quickly and thoroughly I was able to spend more time re-lubing my bike than I might have had otherwise. Had I only have had a bucket of soapy water and hose to clean my bike with I doubt I would have done such a good job, however, that is all I have now to clean my bike with. I use clothes washing powder for the soapy water and give the bearing areas a very wide berth. Same with the hose, I don't point it at the hubs or bottom bracket. I find that riding the bike is a good way to dry it off, plus sticking it under that unshielded nuclear fusion reactor that passes overhead 93 million miles away on most days. The fact of the matter is that anything you use to wash your bike with can push dirt into the bearings. But using water under pressure is not necessarily worse than using the sort of baby's toothbrush that archaeologists use to clean up a Sumerian tablet. The reason being that a jet of water will take the path of least resistance. That isn't necessarily straight into the bearings for there is a rubber seal in the way. From a manufacturer's perspective with parts that come back under warranty, you obviously do not want to encourage 'idiots with steam cleaners' or to recommend any type of pressure washing. However, from my practical experience with hundreds of bicycles I know that pressure washing is best done all the way with 150 degrees hot water and that in some cases you can inadvertently wash the grease out of bearings. The risk is definitely worth taking, even on your own bike. P.S. I do take my bike to the local car wash these days and let the guys there clean up my bike. I don't know what chemical they use in their bucket of soapy water but it seems to work wonders on my alloy wheels. Last time I had to force them to take my money, the time before they wanted all of £2. If you have a garage nearby and have a sense of adventure/humour I recommend giving the car-wash guys a go. 

The heart of a bicycle is the frame - even on a BMX. Both of the models that you are looking at use high-tensile steel rather than steel alloyed with chromium and molybdenum ('cr-mo' steel). With a normal bicycle made of high-tensile steel the problem is the weight - the frame (and fork) weighs significantly more than it would be if it was made of a better 'cr-mo' steel. On a BMX bike the problem with high-tensile steel is not just the added weight. High tensile steel bends whereas 'cr-mo' steel flexes. You need this flex if the bike is to survive crashes as well as intended heavy impacts. Given that there is a premium attached to 'cr-mo' frame/fork many manufacturers replace one or more tubes in a high-tensile steel frame with 'cr-mo' tube(s). They can then put a sticker on the frame claiming it is 'cr-mo'. This gives the impression that the frame is 'cr-mo' when it might be mostly high tensile steel. Therefore, when comparing bikes, look at the frame and fork to see how much of it is 'cr-mo' and how much of it is high-tensile steel. Get this detail right and go from there. Components can be replaced - if the bike comes with cheap plastic pedals then you can upgrade them to something more desirable when they break for a modest amount of money. So get the frame right and look for something with 'cr-mo' at least in the main tubes. EDIT: The GT Article and the Mongoose Performer are very similar in specification. The separate seat clamp on the GT is a neat touch, the frame also appears to be chrome plated rather than painted. Personally I prefer the chrome plating as it can be polished up very easily to remove rust spots whereas the painted frame shows damage that bit more evidently. There is little to choose between the components, so on the basis of the chrome plated frame I would check that it is (and not just painted silver) and go from there. The slight complication and opportunity is with the pricing. There are new 2012 versions out of both of these bikes. Some dealers may therefore want to discount the 'shop soiled' 2011 models that they have in stock so that they can get the 2012 models in. You may want to look at the differences in the model years to see what those differences are, maybe it only comes down to paint scheme, but, with a bit of shopping around, you might be able to get yourself a deal. 

This question was recently the subject of a lengthy article in New Scientist magazine. To summarize: 

That does sound like an excessive wear rate. To improve the situation you may want to pay attention to how clean your rims are and maybe go for a different brake block compound. You could also adjust your riding style to what car drivers call 'hypermiling'. Cleaning the wheels is important because dirt that builds up on the braking surface acts like an abrasive, wearing out your brakes and your rims. There are opinions on how best to clean the wheels, however, I ran out of posh bike-specific cleaning stuff a long time ago and moved onto raiding the washing powder soap. A tablet in a bowl of hot water with the brush from an old dustpan and brush is what works for me now. I then rinse off with cold water afterwards. As for brake blocks, they do wear out and they do need replacing. I prefer to use the blocks with replaceable pads as I then do not lose my setup every time I swap out the pads - the toe-in and angle are what they were when I first set them up and I don't get any surprise squeaks. The replacement pads I use at the moment are dual compound, and, living in the UK I go for the Aztec branded ones. These may not be available where you are, just get the most common brand stocked. If you over-rely on the back brake then that can wear down quickly. Try to use the front brake more than the back, obviously not always, but it does wear less. Finally, make sure the brakes are not pointlessly rubbing whilst you are going along. They don't actually wear that much if they are, but check your brake setup, there are tips on that elsewhere on this site.
