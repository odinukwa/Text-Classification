During a personal communication, Schmerl has suggested the results in the following papers which are closely related to the answer to question 2. I add them here for the sake of those who are interested: Ref: (1) James H. Schmerl, Avoidable algebraic subsets of Euclidean space, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 352 (2000), 2479-2489. (2) James H. Schmerl, Chromatic numbers of algebraic hypergraphs, Combinatorica 37 (2017), no. 5, 1011â€“1026. (3) James H. Schmerl, Deciding the Chromatic Numbers of Algebraic Hypergrahs, (2016). 

The Knight's Tour is a well-known mathematical chess problem. There is an extensive amount of research concerning this question in two/higher dimensional finite boards. Here, I would like to tackle this problem on the unbounded infinite board, $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. The first issue is how to construct a knight's tour on the infinite plane. An intuitive way is to build it locally by mimicking the king's spiral tour in $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ board as follows: 

I guess here some sort of core model argument is needed to prove such a result but maybe there are other methods to ensure that the assumption could not be weaker. 

A knot is an embedding of a circle $S^{1}$ in $3$-dimensional Euclidean space, $\mathbb{R}^3$. Knots are considered equivalent under ambient isotopy. There are two different types of knots, tame and wild. A tame knot is any knot equivalent to a polygonal knot, that is a knot whose image in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is the union of a finite set of line segments. A wild knot is a knot that is not tame. In contrary to the tame knots, wild knots are not well-behaved creatures. They often provide counterexamples to the general version of those theorems which hold for the tame knots. There are several invariants associated with the knots. For example, the crossing number of a knot is a knot invariant defined as the smallest number of crossings of any diagram of the knot. Wild knots (such as the following picture) may have infinite crossing numbers anywhere between $\aleph_0$ and $2^{\aleph_0}$. Remark 1. Some cautiousness is needed in the previous statement. According to what Joel has mentioned in his comment, the last statement can be made more accurate. In fact, the set of crossing points of a wild knot seems to be projective which implies that assuming the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals, it is either countable or of size continuum because the axiom of Projective Continuum Hypothesis holds under this plausible large cardinal assumption. Furthermore, based on Andreas' comment, one may remove the large cardinal assumption in the last argument too. While there has been an extensive amount of research dedicated to the classification of tame knots (particularly the iconic prime ones), up to ambient isotopy, it turned out that the classification of wild knots is generally much more complicated. (In this direction see Kulikov's paper: A non-classification result for wild knots). My question simply is how to make the chaos caused by wild knots even worse by adding new ones to the universe through forcing. 

This question has two original motivations: mathematical and social. The mathematical motivation is mainly based on what I have seen about Zipf's law here and there. The Zipf's law simply states that a Zipfian distribution (a variant of power-law probability distribution) provides a good approximation of many types of data corresponding to physical or social phenomena. The iconic example is the frequency of the words used in a natural language where the Zipf's law indicates that the most frequent word in the language will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. There are plenty of other surprising appearances of Zipf's (and power) law in various real-world situations. For instance, Silagadze in his paper, "Citations and the Zipf-Mandelbrot's law", shows that the number of citations in scientific papers obeys the Zipf's law! 

Update. Thanks to Joel's answer and Eric's counterexample, the questions 1 and 2-4 have been answered positively and negatively respectively. Thus, we know that there are open knight's tours of the unbounded infinite plane, $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$, of different nature, namely those which are formed of local knight's tours of finite planes and those total tours which don't arise this way. In this sense the answer to the question in the title is: "Sometimes but not always!" Remark. As an additional piece of information, it is worth mentioning that there are some simple infinite sub-spaces of $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$-plane which don't admit a knight's tour while some others do. For example, it is easy to see that one can obtain a knight's tour for $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ sub-plane through a local block by block construction via Joel's $5\times 5$ blocks introduced in his answer. However, it is intuitively clear that the infinite strip (i.e. $[-n,+n]\times\mathbb{Z}$ for some $n$) doesn't admit a knight's tour because the knight in such a sub-space must cover both infinite sides of the strip in a back and forth movement and so it should pass the central part of the strip infinitely many times which is impossible simply because after finitely many passages there will be no empty room left in the central region. Anyway, it sounds an interesting question to classify all infinite sub-spaces of $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$-plane which admit a knight's tour. The same has already been done for all finite rectangle-shape sub-spaces of $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$-plane, namely $m\times n$-boards. 

Update. According to the Joel and Mohammad's answers, it turned out that there is more than one approach towards developing a dimension theory for forcing extensions; each with their own characteristics. While Joel's definition requires all forcing dimensions to be infinite, Mohammad's approach allows finite dimensions as well as infinite ones. Also, as Monroe pointed out both definitions fail to satisfy the so-called downwards closure property. In general, Joel's approach sounds a little bit vector space-like to me while Mohammad's reminds me the Krull's dimension in commutative algebra. There is also a chance that these different dimensions be related or coincide with each other under certain circumstances. The point is that in the absence of a general common sense about the expected behavior of a nice forcing dimension, it is not immediately clear whether the mentioned features are flaws or advantages of the presented definitions. Maybe one needs to fix some abstract list of required properties for any such dimension operator and then search for its existence in the forcing extensions. Anyway, if there is any suggestion for such an axiomatic approach towards forcing dimension, I will be so happy to hear about it.
