"and later I regretted" -- remorse is a klesha, an obscuring emotion. Have you learned your lesson and decided what you will do differently now -- that's what matters for your growth, the constructive part, not the feeling of guilt which only weighs you down. 

For all I know, the simile may come from generic Indian religious tradition and not specifically from Buddhism. For example, here are some quotes from Upanidhads: Nirvana Upanishad (~ 100 BCE - 100 CE) : 

The "neither found in any individual part, NOR in the pile of parts, NOR apart from the parts" thesis is probably constructed after canonical Buddha's line in which he shows how such phenomenon as the "Tathagata" can neither be found in the five skandhas ("piles") nor apart from them: (From SA 105) 

Actually, in Pali Canon, Buddha suggests to his students to only eat one time a day, before noon. Among the reasons he provided, the three I remember are: 

The point here is that transcendental patience is not a patience of a victim, it is patience of a master. Development of patience-paramita is related to Buddhist training point known as "taking all bad circumstances onto the path". Instead of mentally labeling problems as punishment or aggression coming from the world, we mentally thank the world for the opportunity to improve our practice. A very specific part of this is the practice of taking all the blame upon oneself. When we meet any unacceptable situation with a very bold and ego-less step of taking all the blame, taking responsibility unconditionally, regardless of who is right -- something magical begins to happen. The bubble of ego energy that was getting pumped by the aversion bursts and a true opening can take place, a true awakening and opening of the eyes. This opening is the paramita of patience. 

-- The opposite of delusion (moha) is apparently wisdom (panna or prajna). Is this right? -- I think this is right. The opposite of delusion is "correct understanding". --Could depression, anxiety, rage, terror, remorse be considered severe forms of delusion? - no, here you are confusing the root of the emotion and the manifestation of the emotion. ...Or is this often linked to the [other two], and seldom exists standalone? The traditional explanation is that emotions are like colors, Three Poisons being the three basic colors that can be mixed to create the rest. I don't like this explanation, because it creates impression that Three Poisons are some sort of main prototypical emotions. They are not, they are roots that emotions come from. is a collection of formulas in your mind that incorrectly describes how things work. It came from observation of real experiences but incorrect understanding of the mechanisms behind these experiences. -- For example, I judge someone negatively in my mind, but it's actually because I did not understand the reason why they are in that situation? --correct, now you got it. This example is a combination of leading to incorrect understanding and leading to qualitative judgement. -- Or I do things like dressing up better for getting recognition from others... -- I think this one is mostly or deep-lying craving for positive experiences. It would be if you dressed-up going to a zoo. -- ...but it's actually because I have the wrong notion of putting too much importance into that recognition? - the fundamental delusion that considers worldly sources of happiness, worldly injustices, and the world itself as something that exists objectively, independently of one's interpretation - and therefore takes them as all-important, is usually called , not . is the deepest and subtlest factor that always underlies all three of , , and . Other types of negative mental states -- How do other types of negative mental states like envy, sloth, conceit, miserliness, restlessness, lack of shame etc. (list of other unwholesome mental states here) connect to the three unwholesome roots? It is said that they all come from a combination of the three roots and the underlying . Avidya confuses reality with interpretation. It therefore incorrectly attributes pleasant&unpleasant/right&wrong characteristics to external objects, while in reality they come from ourselves. Then Lobha comes from assumption that one's feeling of lacking something can be cured by pursuing external goals. And Dosa comes from assumption that some things are truly "good" and "right" and some things are "bad" and "wrong" forgetting that this is only our interpretation. Moha comes from assuming our superficial observations as real and coming to incorrect conclusions based on them. From combination of pursuing external sources of happiness (lobha), judging things as inherently [good or] bad (dosa), and being certain that our partial observations are reality (moha) - comes mismatch between "is" and "should". This mismatch feels as suffering. Then from the three roots plus suffering comes confused action. This confused action creates causes for future confusion. When we correctly understand that reality is our interpretation... That the source of happiness and unhappiness is our own mind... Then we no longer pursue external sources of happiness... We don't judge things as inherrently [good or] bad, we do not confuse our experiences with reality... Then we can stop maintaining the vicious circle of confused action... We can start reducing the conflict between "is" and "should"... The complete removal of this conflict, from coarse to very subtle, feels as complete harmony, also known as Nirvana. 

This is about desire management. Every time we get an urge or an obsession to posses something - that's not us anymore. We become slaves of an idea or an image we have caught somewhere. It's like a mental virus that makes us sick with disease of wanting something. We are not free anymore. So being able to not get obsessed with desires is a matter of mental/emotional health, that leads to freedom to chose what we do based on rationally expected result, not on an irrational urge. 

It is for this reason that upaya, skillful means, exists. Sometimes you have to trick people onto the right path by appealing to what makes sense in their subjective universe. Perception is subjective (~illusory), so creating the right perception can be very effective. This is the true meaning of the "rainbow body". 

Take the blame. I understand they hurt you, nevertheless, you can take responsibility for it. In many cases, that punctures the ball of negative energy and helps it dissipate. Try it, take it on and live with it for a day, see how it feels. 

In the Buddhist context "consciousness" is a well defined function, while "self-awareness" is an interplay of all the five skandhas that under careful examination falls apart akin to an optical illusion. 

The only thing I heard about pendulum in Buddhism was a metaphor used by my first teacher. He said, in the past people used to fluctuate, like a pendulum, between being extremely spiritual in one life and extremely materialistic in another life. He said, in ancient times the pendulum swung a lot slower, maybe over the course of 50 lives. But in our times, the pendulum is so fast that it is effectively in a quantum state - in both extremes at the same time. This is why, he said, now it is appropriate and even desirable to be both spiritual and successful in the world. Never heard of any other mention of pendulum in any Buddhist context. 

Rebirth of individuals does not exist. There is rebirth of information. Because future lives are made from information left by the past lives, Enlightenment is not pointless. 

They say, on hinayana path you overcome desire and on mahayana path you overcome aversion. Maybe that is your problem, aversion. Maybe you should sit down and try to take a very careful look at this aversion for a few hours? Aversion is often rooted in fear of (emotional) pain, or in some old stereotypes / prejudices based on painful experiences... or, generally speaking, in mental attachments to some conceptual ideals of some kind... Try and understand the source of your aversion. Now, you have to realize, compassion is not really a pleasant feeling by any means. It is actually quite painful. After all, you empathize other people's subjective situations, including their confusion and dukkha - how can it not be painful? Therefore, in order to open oneself to compassion, one must open oneself to pain. This is the fundamental diff. between Mahayana and others, because in Mahayana we don't shy away from pain, don't try to trick it away - we live with it. So once you have enough emotional strength to fathom the depth of Samsara and amount of dukkha in the universe... and you're up for the infinity of helping sentient beings... all of which want happiness, but none want your help - so you have to trick them to help them - and this too is painful - then we can call this real Mahayana compassion. 

You said, "Forgiveness means if anybody do some harm to you you don't react and just try to pretend like it never happened to you." This is called "Kshanti-paramita", the perfection of patience. In Buddhism, patience does not mean that you put a lot of effort to keep yourself calm. In Buddhism, patience means you do not have attachments. Because you have no attachments, you can not be offended. The biggest attachment is Ego, the feeling of self-significance in the world. When you feel you are significant, and people do something that shows that you are not, you can easily feel insulted and lose temper. So Ego is like a big sore, very sensitive, that makes you very vulnerable. Other types of attachments are attachment to religion, attachment to "we", attachment to some sort of theory, attachment to intellect, attachment to purity etc. When you have no attachments, no Ego, no self-significance - you become very patient. You become unmovable, invulnerable. This is called perfection of patience. 

The attitude to meditation varies by school. In Mahayana, we don't do the "just notice itching, itching" piece. Instead, I was instructed to set the mind at ease, the sort of mood you find when you finally get a vacation after a long year, and have a good stretch in shezlong chair on the beach. It's like "pheeeew, finally, I have the moment to myself to get back to my senses". You stop chasing problems and desires like a hamster in the wheel, you take a deep sigh, you come back to the present moment, and you finally take a look at your surroundings and yourself. "Where am I? What's going on? What the hell was I doing all this time? Let me just sit down and get back to my senses." Then you hang in this state until the thoughts and memories inevitably come up. When they do come up, you don't let them carry you away too much, but you don't forcefully ward them off either. You have the strings of your guitar somewhat relaxed but leave enough tension for the music to play. When you notice the thoughts have carried you away, you just smile (you don't have to - I smile cuz I find it funny every time) and notice this fact (you don't actually say "thinking" or "thoughts" nor say it in your head, you just realize you got distracted). And then you bring yourself back to the beach and the chair and your vacation mindstate. This works like a laundry machine for the mind. You go back to the slow stable self (the sitting part), while letting other parts of the mind process the suppressed issues (the bubbling up part) and you let the two layers integrate (by mildly watching for distractions and coming back). Specifically in your case, I would scratch my ear or adjust my posture etc. For me, meditation is coming back to my vacation, not a torture.
