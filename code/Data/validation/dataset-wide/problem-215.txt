Yes they would be reproductively isolated. Why do I think so? Well, bats and birds can't interbreed, and neither can dolphins and sharks, and each pair have evolved in worlds with exactly the same early-earth conditions, to fulfill roles which are exceedingly similar to their other half (two animals evolved for flying, two evolved for swimming, of similar size and shape and similar sorts of "successes" I guess would be my term, and yet totally different). Even better, they share the same historical conditions with exacting precision, and a fair chunk of familial resemblance from their very-base level processes from their shared ancestors, which is above and beyond what your question requires :) And so, if bipedal hairless monkeys evolve again from this simulation, to fit the niche of thinking predators who adapt the environment to them rather than the reverse and then tinker with the world... they would probably have less in common with human-people than a bird and a bat have in common. Evolving flight (and evolving into all the niches) is probably not more of an overlapping niche, or indeed more of a specialization, than what human-people have done. Evolution on earth was driven by a lot, a lot of factors - including geography, local conditions, and each other. Some of which are factors we don't know. some of which are factors we can't recreate or influence, and some of which are factors tightly correlated with adapting to changing circumstances (again, including each other). we can't even run a stimulation of earth's historical conditions without running into patches where we're not exactly sure what was going on or which factors led to which results, and you would as a preliminary starter need to be able to perfectly reproduce them. If you sent an exact replica of (early) earth, accurately programmed to change for every variable earth underwent - including cosmic radiation, precise light and gravity fluctuations, minutiae of geography including volcanic eruptions and tetonic movement, extinction events (and who/what survived and didn't), meteors and such, the moon - you still could not guarantee humans, because you can't monitor interactions of the evolving creatures with each other enough to insure evolution stayed "on course", and if you could any intervention would be "taken advantage of" or, hm, adapted around, to change the actual results. The godling of the simulation favors primates, so now you have a thousand and a half extra primate species that survived thanks to its intervention - oops. Or else it knows dinosaurs are supposed to evolve and then go extinct, except it was juust a leeetle bit too good, and the predecessors to alligators, or some other lizards, or birds, now didn't survive, either - oops. Ah, wait, it knows that horses are gonna be really important, better make sure they don't get lost - and horses can now afford to be a little slower, a touch more arrogant, taking advantage of this invisible protection instead of getting better, and we end up with non-domesticable unicorns or thirteen extra species of zebra, instead of the horses we could breed for work and travel. And in all those altered initial conditions and interactive shenanigans, the precursors to humans never get off the ground, or become something slightly different, and whatever ends up taking the human-people's niche (if, indeed, anything ever does) need not be any more closely related to us than a dolphin is to a shark just because they both swim and eat fish and can't stay still underwater too long or without drowning. 

Art In any case, the thing about making matter into exactly what you want, is that you can make really good art out of it - you can shape matter as you please, thus, sculpture. Or a painting. You can take raw materials, and come out with a project that's a lot more valuable than you started with (as art does),and if in your case, the original materials weren't needed, who is actually gonna know? You can make originals, easy, just by making something out of your head, tweaking to your own tastes, and selling as part of a series or as reproductions. You can make reproductions - note that forgery will get you in trouble, but openly labeling your products as reproductions (and possibly adding or altering some detail, so it is obviously not forgery) will let you escape a lot of trouble - and people are willing to pay a lot, especially since you can go from "simple replica" to "museum-quality" reproductions, with accompanying price ranges, pretty easily. You can get your hands on reproductions by purchasing them, or visit museums and libraries for access to originals (once you've built up a reputation, you may be able to arrange for closer visits as an expert). You should think about your medium - wood sculpture, you can buy a few cords of wood and have a bonfire every day, and no one knows your stash of wood carvings didn't come from that wood. Paint and canvases are also pretty cheap, you can easily find something to do with them (even if it is raw material for your talent, even if it is a side hobby, even if it is hide or discard them somehow). It would be wise to pick up, as a hobby, whatever "art" you choose to sell (or information on the historical techniques replicated, whatever), since people may be asking about technique... on the other hand, artists are supposed to be eccentric, so you just need to have something to say, or never talk to people about art, or claim your best work comes in trances or something. Jewelry Along the same lines, you might take up jewelry making. Even working with basic materials, copper or aluminum wires or something like that, the ability to shape precisely will let you form salable pieces - and since the value is the effort (or supposed effort, though having secret matter-bending talent isn't exactly less effort than making art the usual way), it won't matter that your original materials are inexpensive, or that your tools are basic. You can work you way up to grander, more expensive works - and higher prices - without anyone questioning where the pieces are coming from. Buy raw materials, use some of them to transmute with, use some to just play with, give some away, have a workshop or three stuffed with odd bits and pieces, claim you often trade raw materials for finished products and that's why you rarely are seen purchasing, whatever. The thing is, there's no cheat - because the stuff is real, the delicate shaping is what people pay for, so there's no real incentive for people to fake it. 

Something like vitilego might do it - it causes patches of skin without melanin (the most common pigment) giving a patchwork appearance with dark and pale skin. Or something like, in one of Murray Leinster's Med Ship stories there was a mild disease, which had piggybacked on a worse one, that had the primary symptom of causing blue patches on the skin. If the disease is very mild, people might not think about curing it, they might not even notice beyond the color (especially if they have other, immediate concerns at the time it appeared). And some diseases are inheritable. Otherwise, something like a virus (that meddles with DNA) might have a marker it leaves behind, that can as a side effect alter the DNA regulating skin or eye color in a way that makes it...produce unusual pigmentation. So anyone who caught the disease might have the color change, and any of their descendants might have it too, depending on the modification on question. That will spread a lot faster than inheritable mutation alone. Or, even more simply, some otherwise harmless bacteria which tends to colonize human skin develops some property altering color - depending on the bacteria and/or its environmental conditions, it might result in coloration alterations in patches, in specific areas, or over the whole skin. And, of course, some environmental effects can be a side effect of certain practices Foods or other optional applications may have an effect on appearance, even long lasting ones, but they would likely not be consistent over a large population or in different climates without some extra encouragement - like ritual or religious use, medicinal use, or other practical uses like cleaning, pest control, or the like that makes that specific product ubiquitous. So, maybe there's an oil that makes one's skin turn a bit more orange with every application, but people use it anyway because of health benefits (like sunscreen), or pest control (like citronella). Maybe there's a beverage that makes the eyes, whites included, turn a bit greener the more it is consumed - but people keep drinking because of religious ritual or just culturally accepted practice (ie, equivalent of alcohol - it does show up just about everywhere). Maybe there's a plant used for cleaning (like we use lemon in so many cleaning products, or like we use chlorine in cleaning the water) that has a pigment like henna does, making everything dye redder and redder as long is its used, and lasts long enough for the effects to be overlapping. The original colonists might not have cared about side effects next to the benefits - and later generations might not have known, especially if it is ubiquitously used. Or it might have turned into culturally accepted practice, interwoven in beauty standards or something. These effects will all be limited That is, some will occur only as long as the environmental influence is present, and may fade if the person leaves the planet, stops using the product, or technology finds a non-altering equivalent. Others may last a lifetime, since the change once made cannot be undone, but kids born without the influence will lack the trait. And still others may take generations to fade (if selected away from or genetically diluted), or may never fade at all without interference since the relevant factor remains present - the diseases which alter DNA or which are carried along and contagious or inherited by each generation. So, you might have a very striking appearance change that slowly fades as someone leaves the planet and/or its customs, and develops as someone moves there and picks the customs (and conditions) up. You might have kids physically different from their parents depending on the environment in which they're born. You may have an overall, very dramatic appearance change consisting of several elements, some of which are very immediate and some of which are more long lasting, some of which are present more in some cultures or areas than others. You may have evidence of historical influences on the changes - including manufacturing, medicinal knowledge, and fashion - as what is known about these factors changes with technology and common knowledge. And all of them will be varied by individuals, by climate or populations, and by the presence or absence of other environmental or cultural factors. Planet-wide, with a diverse population and many different climates, ecosystems, and lifestyles, you would likely find a lot of variation in whatever traits you choose - which can still be quite noticeable, it is just more likely to be slight tendencies, or frequency or populations with any given trait, or more visible in some people and less in others (possibly with social cues tied to the less and the more). 

No There's a difference between what people think, what they believe, what they present... and additionally, what's true. Your telepath may be able to pick up on one or maybeso two of them, but the last will trip them up hard. Honesty, loyalty, competence, and effectiveness are not synonyms. Your warlord is dealing with people, and people - are just not simple. The previous differences will make a huge difference in deciding who to trust, who to listen to, and who to believe (and yeah, those aren't the same thing either). His enemies' plans will also not be 100% set in stone. They should be calculating a lot of possibilities based on what they know, assume, see the warlord doing, and have lots of contingency plans. The telepath might see some of those plans - but everyone involved will be plotting lots of plans, and since they aren't "decided", who can say which will end up happening? There will be more than one person he is acting against in each situation (kings, generals, army leaders, advisors), they may or may not be in agreement (and if they disagree, he has to decide which plan to counter). If someone changes the plan in the middle of things, that will not be available in advance. How the enemies will react once the warlords' plans go into effect is also up in the air, they may react in unexpected ways and without time for the warlord to react to those changes. If someone on the other side doesn't inform people of the whole plan, but just parts - the people in range on the battlefield can't betray it to the telepath. Anyway, set that aside and let's say your telepath knows when someone is lying to them. Handwave away, for the moment, all the limitations on how many can be picked up at a time, if one person can be picked out of a crowd, how deep the deception goes before it can't be picked up (because the person is lying to themselves...). He asks - can this be done? and gets answers of yes, no, if they do it this way, if you do it that way... and even if they all think they're telling the truth, who can say who is right? Or, if one was thinking about spending the coins he would get rather than filling his head with the reasons for his recommendation - did that make his answer wrong? What if one was planning to betray him - but maybe was giving good advice in the meantime, so to have a better situation to "inherit" from him? Will these things make your telepath not believe them, and what happens then if one was right, and your telepath listened to an honest fool instead? Your warlord may lose everything here, and this is not even about knowing his enemies, it is about his own soldiers, advisors, generals, and allies! And even if the telepathy has given some game-changing secret, the warlord dare not forget that he needs the loyalty of his followers, and the agreement of his allies - expecting none of them to object (or not ally with him) because of telepathy being used on them is not likely, and just as problematic is them seeing him acting on information that they don't know where its coming from and it doesn't make sense to them, listening to people (or not) on what seems a whim, and knowing he doesn't trust them with the reasons why. Will they believe the game changing secret? Will they believe the telepath is loyal to the warlord? Do they know that's where the information comes from? Do they believe what he does based on the telepathic information is done because of facts, not whim? Telepathy seems easy, like a shortcut. Telepathy seems useful. That's why it is a trap for your warlord. Because warlords and generals have been fighting without the advantage, and there are plausible ways, which let the greatest make themselves successful, to root out disloyalty or treason, judge which of several options is wisest, to look at ideas as more than the person who offered them. And it would be so easy, to lean on telepathy instead, and forget (or let dull) all those necessary skills. It would be easy to pick someone enthusiastic over someone competent, to favor someone obedient over someone effective. It would be easy to favor ideas based on who is loyal and honest, or overlook ideas from those of more... ambiguous loyalties, instead of judging the ideas themselves for what will work best in a situation. Easy to believe that knowing a secret is true (via telepathy) doesn't mean having to justify it, or risk losing the faith of those who follow him. And, yeah, in the end I think the telepathy will make it far to easy for your warlord to fail. 

So, your god has set a test for just under 2, or 2.5, or even 3% of your society. The reason for "just under" your chosen percentage, is so that you can grab some scientists. You will need only a few, but want more than a handful - preferably widely spread, well respected, and quite devoted. They need to be convinced of your theory, so that it can spread and be believed by your general population. Come up with a few tests that "prove" your original explanation, like a psychology test ends up letting groups of people recreate the manifestations if they believe hard enough, or certain rituals will let someone control the weather, or these special rocks will let one influence the fire, or whatever proof your god came up with to fit the explanation. Some of your scientists (up to the percentage) will be lead to the experiments first (by influence direct or indirect, maybe lean on your leaders and priests), others will need direct visitation. A number of top scientists "discovering" the phenomenon "independently" will give it legitimacy - especially if some are reacting in genuine horror at the implications. It's important that the test, whatever it is, is actually reproducible, at least for your one year, as that will be the "proof". Remember to blame the boojum, your scientists will be a lot less forgiving of a deliberate crisis of faith if they don't think there's a reason!
