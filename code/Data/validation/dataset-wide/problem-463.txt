already put-together (I found many sources of LED strip lighting but then we'd have to borrow a soldering iron and get our own battery pack and seal it ourselves) not cost-prohibitive (there are lots of places that have nice lights but even for a DIY solution, it's either 2 overpriced half-metres or the next level up is buying 5m which is way too much)...$40 plus shipping would be nice. I guess we could spend up to $80 after shipping but really...we're replacing dollar-store lights here. 

Something else to consider is that many bike shops will offer a seat trial program. You can pay a fee to use multiple seats and find the one that is right for you. The initial fee you paid will be applied to the purchase price of the saddle that you choose. 

The quick release lever is standard and you should just be able to pick one up second hand or from your local bike shop. Make sure you get the one for the front and not for the rear. 

We have a child trailer (like this--link has better side/rear view but requires flash) and want to be seen by cars when biking at night. The little red blinking bike lights available in our area are terrible: even the expensive ones break very easily, turn off after going over the slightest bump, etc. I am having a very hard time finding a product, by a company that ships to Canada, meeting all of the following requirements: 

I came so close to finding something, but the few options that fit all criteria were made by companies that did not ship to Canada (thanks for telling me only once I reached the checkout, and not allowing this as a search criterion even when logged in, Amazon...) There's also the one product "exclusively licensed to Chariot", StrideLite: 

I am strictly a Lycra guy... now what will I wear? ;) But seriously, if anyone can point to a good resource for Vintage bike attire that would be great. 

I need to replace my chain and cassette and I am not sure what "level" I need to pick? I have SRAM RED and have never replaced my cassette or chain (Two years) I had brought my bike in for a tune up and they recommended that I do it. I have chosen the SRAM PG-1070 (11-28) but I am not how to pick a chain. In addition there are chains and cassettes that cost in excess of $300? Why would I need a $300 chain? 

I have a Campagnolo Chorus 10 speed rear derailleur that will not shift properly. I've aligned the frame, adjusted the high and low settings and attempted to fine-tune the shifting with the barrel adjusters but it will not shift properly. The cage itself appears to be slightly out of alignment. Can this be serviced, or better yet swapped out for the cage on a 10-speed Daytona derailleur( that I happen to have)? This question is not a duplicate as the Campagnolo products are different from SRAM or Shimano and I was specifically asking about replacing parts, not how to adjust the derailleur. 

...but apparently it's terrible, which you can pretty much tell just by looking at it. It doesn't light up the back at all, which is often the part you'll need to make more visible. Any suggestions? This is getting frustrating, and I'm surprised at the lack of solid options I've come across so far. 

I have an innertube for a Chariot stroller that apparently came from Europe, and the local bike shop people couldn't find one in their catalogs that was both the right size and having the thing I'm trying to describe. I want to search for it myself but don't know what it's called. It's a longer than normal valve, and has a washer-like thing (metal, but thicker than a washer, and threaded) that you spin down the valve until it locks the valve in place to the rim. (We need one because we're going through innertubes like crazy--whenever you pump up a Chariot with the compact style pump we have, it wears the crap out of the valve.) They could find it in the skinny Presta valve diameter but not in the standard valve diameter. What's it called? (And if you happen to know, where in Canada can I order one?) Thanks, Kev 

Last year I bought some Kreitler rollers and used them somewhat. The biggest problem I have is starting. I have 4.5-Inch Kreitler Alloy Rollers with Killer Headwind Fan Drums. Does anyone have a suggest on an easy way to start? 

I have a 2010 Gary Fisher Cronus, when I brought the bike in for a tune up this spring the bike shop told me they wouldn't do it because of cracks around the seat post. They pointed out that I had my seat post so high that it wasn't able to give adequate support. I will note that last year I would hear some loud "pops" when going over bumps. I always assumed it was a rock hitting my frame. The shop found the cracks with a light. I went and bought a longer seat post and I have been riding the bike all season. Questions: Will my frame fall apart from underneath me? If I can't see the cracks, are they still repairable? Is there an easy way of getting an inventory of the cracks on the frame? At what point is the frame just plane old and I need to tell my wife I need to buy a new one? Finally: Is there a proper way to frame the question so my wife will say "Yes" The last question was a joke :) 

To install a front brake you will need to have a fork that will accept the brake caliper. There are three potential options for this: A standard road caliper (hole through the fork crown), cantilever/ v-brakes ( one post on either side of the fork blade) or a disc mount (bracket at the end of the fork on the non-drive side). The Masi Soulville should have the first option, a hole drilled through the fork crown for installing a standard road caliper. You will need to get a road caliper that is intended for use with a flat bar brake lever, as many road calipers are intended for use with drop handlebar levers. 

Here is the backpack I use. I live in Minnesota so we need to worry about hot 30c and cold -30c - This backpack breaths well, but of course you will sweat when it is 30c. This works for everyday use as well as bike commuting 

I regularly race Duathlons and Triathlons. When I am off the bike and running my calves are like rocks for the first mile. I have been told to try to flatten by foot and not "Point" my toes down. I use Speedplay pedals. I have regular Specialized Road shoes (Stiff soles) I ride a road bike (Gary Fisher Cronus) My question: Should I always try to pedal flat and without my toe pointed down? 

One thing that is a possible disadvantage is that if your seat post is too long it can run into your bottle/ bidon mounting screw, which won't allow you to push it in all the way. This has come up as an issue for me when packing a bike for flying or sticking it in the trunk of a car. 

I think the ideal chain replacement would be the Sram PC-1. I use this on my single speed mountain bike and stand up and crank on it with no issues what so ever. The installation is very straight forward and the master link is very easy to use. I would definitely not recommend an old multi-speed chain for this application mainly because the PC-1 is so affordable and effective. The one issue that I do have with the PC-1 is that the master link is a bit wide and it does rub a bit on the bashguard that is installed on my Sram crankset, but it does not affect performance in any way.
