I don't think cash could be described as a security... one of the characteristics of securities is that they have imperfect (if very high) liquidity and provide a return (be it fixed or variable). Cash is the definition of liquid and inherently provides no return - you could earn interest on cash by depositing it in a bank but then you are creating a debt obligation in effect - the cash inherently, as in cash in a physical safe, generates zero return nominal by definition. You could think of cash as a debt security where a debt is theoretically placed on the issuer. But: in practice the debt is impossible to pay. You cannot bring a bill into the fed and demand they honour it. So I suppose it would be a debt security in the theoretical sense but it lacks almost all properties of debt securities: cannot be repaid in practice, never intended to be repaid, perfectly liquid etc, and it has a value that cannot be expressed in terms of anything but itself. 

To answer the specific question, I believe the largest hf in the world is Bridgewater (assets under management of around 120bn USD). Assets of around 500m USD would be considered average and north of 1bn usd large. Bridgewater is an outlier. I do not know if one larger has ever existed but I doubt it. As to what effects they have on the economy well, funds can serve as catalysts for economic events (e.g. Soros' fund and others catalysing the UK exit from the ERM). They serve as vehicles for pooling and allocating capital and so act as intermediaries between those who wish to lend (investors in the hedge fund) and those who wish to borrow (firms issuing bonds etc. which the hf buys). This function only applies when the hedge fund is making a primary investment though - when it is buying something in the secondary market rather than a first issuance funds do not have this role. They largely determine things like commodity prices, exchange rates through the bulk of money they control together, although no hedge fund is large enough to control these markets directly. 

I'm not sure I fully understand what you mean by computing it endogenously? The nominal interest rate would be endogenous in the NK framework because the output gap and inflation are endogenous. There'd be feedback between nominal interest rates and inflation, which both feed into each other for example. So in that sense I'd consider the approximation of interest rate policy using a Taylor rule as entailing that interest rate policy WAS endogenous wrt. the output gap and inflation. As for why we'd use the Taylor rule as opposed to some more complex but accurate approximation for interest rate policy... well I can only suppose that the Taylor rule is a sufficiently good approximation such that the marginal benefit of adding more complexity / accuracy is minimal and perhaps less than the computational cost of doing so. There comes a point where you start to prioritize parsimony more and more. Perhaps this is the motivation. 

Such preferences have a utility representation $u(x, y) = xy$, and therefore they are reflexive, transitive and complete. However, these are not symmetric because $(1,2)\succsim (1,1)$ but $(1,1)\not\succsim (1,2)$. But we can define the indifference relation $\sim$ from the weak preference relation $\succsim$ in this way: 

Solution (using method 2): Given the data in question, we see that both the production functions exhibit constant returns to scale and the PPF will be of the form $4x + y =$ constant. Therefore, the price ratio $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ in equilibrium will be 4 regardless of the initial endowments. This will be true as long as both the inputs $L$ and $K$ are available in positive quantities. Equilibrium can be fully determined once the details about endowments are specified. To find $\frac{w}{r}$ ratio we need to know the total endowment of labor and capital in the economy, and to find the absolute prices of $X$ and $Y$ given $w = 1$ we need the data on how much of the total endowment of labor and capital belongs to each consumer. 

We are given the production function $Q = \left(\min(K, L)\right)^\beta$. Cost minimization problem of the producer is defined as finding the labor-capital combination that minimizes the cost of producing at least $y$ units of output given that the price of labor is $w$, and price of capital is $r$. \begin{eqnarray*} \min_{L, K} && wL + rK \\ \text{s.t.} && \left(\min(K, L)\right)^\beta \geq y \\ && K \geq 0, \ L \geq 0 \end{eqnarray*} Solution to this problem (also known as conditional input demand functions) satisfy: \begin{eqnarray*} L = K = y^{1/\beta} \end{eqnarray*} and the associated (optimal) cost function is therefore, \begin{eqnarray*} C(w,r,y) = (w+r)y^{1/\beta} \end{eqnarray*} 

Alternatively for Q 4, the problem can also be converted to a single variable optimization problem. This is because the individual will always consume equal amounts of $x_1$ and $x_2$ in equilibrium. Substituting $x_2=x_1$ yields : \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{x_2} & \ \ \frac{x_2}{(1+x_2)^2} \\ \text{s.t.} & \ \ 0 \leq x_2 \leq 2.5 \end{eqnarray*} Differentiating $\dfrac{x_2}{(1+x_2)^2}$ with respect to $x_2$ gives the following necessary condition $\dfrac{(1+x_2)^2 - 2(1+x_2)x_2}{(1+x_2)^4} = \dfrac{1-x_2^2}{(1+x_2)^4} = 0$ which yields $x_2 = 1$, and the corresponding value of $x_1 = 1$. 

A common calibration for depreciation rates within RBC models is to assume 10% depreciation rate (based on NIPA stats, for instance). This implies a half-life of about 6.5 years. But this estimate seems a little low for advanced economies where capital is often in the form of computerized technology etc, which would seem to depreciate at a much faster rate (say 25% pa, implying a half-life of more like 2.5 yrs). Further, with technological advance you have the problem of obsolescence - the useful life of a capital good may end long before it depreciates away fully using the 10% pa rate. There is an element of unpredictability around obsolescence as well. How can this be accounted for within RBC and DSGE models? Would obsolescence pose a problem for calibrating a model assuming delta is approx. 10%? Thanks in advance, R. 

Is CPI accurate relative to... what? If you are asking whether CPI is accurate as a measure of the true cost of living, the answer is no. One reason for this is that the CPI is computed using a weighted Laspeyres index of prices of different goods and services, weighted by their share in consumption. Prices are continually updated but weights are not, and hence the headline CPI index neglects substitution effects. Let me present a highly simplified example; two goods in the economy, apples and oranges, both consumed equally (weights 0.5 / 0.5). At the start, the price index computed using CPI methodology will be 100. Now the price of apples rises 10% and the price of oranges stays the same. As a result, people substitute out of apples and into oranges - so apples' share of consumption falls from 50% to 25%. The consumer price index would now stand at 105, implying a 5% increase in the cost of living. However, the true increase in the cost of living is 2.5% - CPI has overstated inflation in the cost of living through failing to take account of substitution. Most countries reset their CPI weights yearly. Some, e.g. Japan I believe, reset once every decade only. Obviously the less frequently you reset your weights, the worse CPI will be as an accurate measure of the cost of living. 

Since $u$ is concave, lottery $X$ is preferred over lottery $Y$. This because $X$ gives the expected value of the lottery $Y$ with probability 1. Also, $F$ does not FOSD $G$ because $F\left(\frac{M}{2}\right) = 1 > \frac{1}{2} = G\left(\frac{M}{2}\right) $. 

To find the Pareto optimal outcomes, simply maximize the total income of the labor and the firm. \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{L} \ \ \begin{cases} L(100-L) & \text{if } L \leq 50 \\ 2500 & \text{if } L > 50 \end{cases}\end{eqnarray*} Solution to the above problem is any $L \geq 50$. The corresponding maximum total income is 2500, which can now be divided among the labor and the firm in any way, thus yielding all Pareto optimal allocations. Therefore, set of all Pareto optimal outcomes where both the firm and the labor get non-negative payoffs is : $\{(w, L) \in \mathbb{R}^2_+ : L \geq 50, wL \leq 2500 \}$ 

If $S_Y$ is the amount saved by $Y$ in the first period, and $T_X$ is the amount transferred by $X$ to $Y$ in the second period, then $X$'s payoff as function of his choice $T_X$, taking as given $Y$'s choice $S_Y$ is $$\ln(I - T_X) + a\left(\ln(I-S_Y) + b\ln(S_Y+T_X)\right)$$ $X$ will choose $T_X$ by solving the following problem : $$\max_{T_X \geq 0} \ \ \ln(I - T_X) + a\left(\ln(I-S_Y) + b\ln(S_Y+T_X)\right)$$ First-order condition for optimality is: $$\frac{1}{I-T_X} =\frac{ab}{S_Y + T_X} $$ Solving it for $T_X$ we get, $$T_X = \frac{abI-S_Y}{ab+1}$$ This is the best response transfer function of $X$. Now we solve $Y$'s utility maximization problem in period 1, taking as given $X$'s best response function of period 2. \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{S_Y\geq 0} & & \ln(I - S_Y) + b\ln\left(S_Y + \frac{abI-S_Y}{ab+1}\right)\end{eqnarray*} which can be rewritten as \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{S_Y \geq 0} & & \ln(I - S_Y) + b\ln\left(I+S_Y\right) + b \ln\left(\frac{ab}{ab+1}\right)\end{eqnarray*} Solving it we get $$S_Y^* = \max\left(\frac{(b-1)I}{b+1}, 0\right) $$ Since $b \in (0, 1)$, $$S_Y^* = 0$$ Consequently, $$T_X^* = \frac{abI}{ab + 1}$$ 

Consider another example: Consider a pure exchange economy with two goods X and Y and two consumers A and B. Suppose utility functions are $$u_A(x_A, y_A) = \min(x_A, y_A)$$ and $$u_B(x_B, y_B) = \min(x_B, y_B)$$ 

Since payoff from playing $D$ is more than the payoff from playing any other strategy for player 2, he will always choose $D$ in response to any mixed strategy of player 1 where 1 play $B$ with probability $p$ and $C$ with probability $(1-p)$. Therefore, $D$ is the best response of player 2 if 1 play a mixed strategy $B$ with probability $p$ and $C$ with probability $(1-p)$. However, given the strategy $D$ of player 2, player 1's best response is to play a pure strategy $B$. Therefore, there is no Nash equilibrium in which player 1 mixes between $B$ & $C$.
