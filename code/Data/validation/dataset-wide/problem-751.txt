I'll second Eric's answer, but with a little more detail. There is no way to exercise that will produce "spot removal" of fat. The only way to do that is via liposuction. Each person's body will deposit fat differently. For instance, my body starts with deposits on my lower back, then on my belly, and then my upper arms and face. Other people start on their belly or upper arms. If you reduce or increase your body fat percentage slowly over time, you can easily observe the pattern your body uses. You can also see it in videos of the morbidly obese, who have massive variety in how their fat gets stored. If you want to lose tummy fat, the best bike ride is the one that burns the most calories, since (provided you don't eat to make up for the lost energy) this will cause the burning of fat. Energy expenditure is just time * intensity, and there are lots of good calculators for this floating around online. For the untrained cyclist, I think they're pretty accurate (trained cyclists can be more efficient). Short, hard rides are probably a good choice if you want to lose weight, because they take less time per calorie spent. 60 minutes as fast as you can maintain it is a good choice, because it's a nice length of time where you shouldn't need a snack, even at maximum effort. At first you may not be able to go fast if you lack cardiovascular strength, but even at a walking-level effort you should be able to cover about 12-15km in that time, about twice the distance you're doing now. For a typical person, this would burn maybe 500 kcals. Then just work on going faster (and therefore further) each time you go. Doing that level of exercise daily should result in the loss of a 1lb of fat/week, provided you don't eat more to make up for it. 

Hold the chain in one hand so that a few links are exposed as a small loop. One of these links should hold the newly-inserted pin. The portion of the pin to be removed should be facing towards you. Grab the pin with the pliers so that the pin & pliers are perpendicular. A quick, sharp, opposite direction twist of both wrists should snap the pin. There will be resistance, but it will snap. 

If all goes well, the pin will break so that the remaining portion is flush with the outer edge of the chain. 

You can certainly switch to a more appropriate tire. Schwalbe Big Apples are a popular choice -- I use their 26x2.0 tires on my mountain bike. They roll well on asphalt, and are quite functional on packed dirt and gravel. They're not suitable for loose dirt/gravel, rocks, roots, etc, you'll need a knobby mountain bike tire for those. The only real downside to this plan: If you intend to ride your bike in the city, and often ride trails as well, you'll quickly tire (pun intended) of switching between your mountain tires and your city tires. If you reach that point, you might consider buying a separate set of wheels and keeping the mountain tires mounted on one and the city tires on the other. 

Waterloo, Ontario, Canada All the main routes have front mounted bike racks. The secondary routes have them on most (but not all) buses. 

Flat pedals at first, clipless after you're comfortable with being unable to coast. Learning to ride clipless from the start, probably with the tension turned way down. 

I have been offered possession of a very old and interesting bicycle, made in 1933. It appears to be in quite good condition, and has a lot of interesting history. However, it features a 26'' frame, which is rather large for 6'0'' me. In fact, I usually ride a 22'' frame. Because of the era of production, the length of the bike is actually fine, and it's just the hight that is off. I'm wondering what sort of things I might do to mitigate this, as part of a larger restoration project. The only one that occurs so far is to perhaps reduce the wheel size to 26''. Naturally this could cause problems with the brakes, but I can see several ways around that. What other things might be done? 

In the US it varies by state. Here in Washington State, a bike on the road is considered a vehicle, while a bike on a sidewalk or crosswalk is considered a pedestrian. From RCW (Revised Code of Washington) 46.61.755: 

+1 on the zip ties and power link recommendations. I once saw a photo of an emergency field repair to a broken chainstay using only Popsicle sticks and zip ties. 

Poland-based company "efneo" is developing a three speed crankshaft gearbox: $URL$ This product will allegedly ship next year. 

Can you tell if the pain is from pressure or abrasion? If it's pressure, then the it's probably because it was your first long ride. It takes a while to get your butt "battle hardened" for longer rides. Sadly, one quickly loses this after a week or two off the bike. If it's abrasion, then check the saddle to see if anything is rubbing during your pedal stroke. Also check your shorts/pants for fabric seams that could cause issues. Finally, check your saddle height. If it's a bit too high then your hips will rock as you pedal, causing abrasion and leading to unhappiness. +1 to @batman's suggestion of padded bike shorts. You can also get a bike-specific padded liner and wear it in lieu of underwear under normal shorts/pants. 

@Superdesk has the right answer, but I thought I'd add some math to give an impression of the size of the difference. As others have stated, drag is a quadratic function of relative wind speed. This is why you need a lot more effort to go from 0 to 10 km/h than from 20 to 30 km/h on a bike. Suppose that you like to bike at 20km/h. If you go for a ride on a day with no wind, you have a relative wind speed of 20km/h the whole way (you move 20 km/h faster than the air around you). Suppose that you lose 1000 Cal. to drag on this ride. Now suppose you go riding on a day with a 10 km/h wind, and ride a loop that's half as long. For the first half of the loop, with a tail wind, your relative wind speed is 20-10 km/h = 10 km/h. But because drag is quadratic, this means you actually lose just one fourth the energy you would at a 20km/h wind speed. So you lose 125 Cal to drag on the first half of the ride (1000/2 = 500 for only riding half way, 500/4 because of the reduced drag). On the second half of the loop, with a head wind, your relative wind speed is 20+10 = 30 km/h. Again, because drag is quadratic, this means you don't expend 50% more energy, you expend 125% more energy. So you lose 1125 Cal. to drag on the second half of the ride (1000/2 = 500 for only riding half way, 500 *9/4 = 1125 for the quadratic drag) So in total on the windy day, you expend 1250 Cal, or 25% more riding the same distance, at the same ground speed, just for a light breeze! Also interesting to note that you'll lose 90% of the energy on the way back! This actually gets worse very fast as the wind speed climbs. Where I live we often have 40km/h sustained winds, which means 450% more energy loss for the same ground speeds. This is when it takes all your energy to ride downhill! 

The Pearl Izumis are my current favorites. They're far from perfect, but they suck less than other gloves I've tried. BTW -- it sounds like you may have a fit problem with the bike, not the gloves. No glove will compensate for a poorly fitting bike. Get a professional fit from a local bike shop. 

I've done it a few times on Shimano nine speed chains (for road bikes and mountain bikes) with no problems. Are you sure it's the correct pin? Are you sure it's inserted fully? If it's correct and fully inserted, then the gap cut into the pin should be fully visible outside the link. Here's how I do it: 

Jan Heine & crew at Bicycle Quarterly recently reported the results of their wind tunnel research. A summary is available online, but the full results are only available in the printed journal. 

Brake pads for a rim brake are usually treated with Carbon Black (powered carbon) to make them last longer. This is what makes them black. When I ride a road bike in hilly areas, the carbon black accumulates on the rim and on areas surrounding the brake pads. Later, if I ride the bike in the rain (without fenders), this powder mixes with dirty water kicked up by the wheels, and spreads around on the frame of the bike, and into gaps on the headset and bottom bracket. If allowed to dry, it becomes extremely difficult to remove. Right now I remove as much as I can with elbow grease, and then make an abrasive paste out of water and baking soda. The paste works pretty well, but leaves a residue. Further, on some of the really bad stains, it seems to spread out the carbon as much as clean it off. It still needs a lot of rubbing. Is there a standard cleaner in which carbon black is soluble? Is there a better way to remove it? 

Keep in mind that hitch racks intended to carry large numbers of bikes (including the North Shore six bike rack) tend to require heavy duty 2" receivers. Ensure your vehicle is properly equipped. If you have room inside the van, you can use one of these to carry a few bikes (perhaps in addition to 4 bikes on a more typical hitch rack): $URL$ I use the Bike Tote in the back of my Toyota Tacoma pickup to carry two bikes. It works well -- it holds the bikes securely, and is very easy to install/remove the rack to/from the vehicle. 

My commute is about 36K each way, and my office does not have shower facilities. I live in an area with "OK" public transportation, and luckily the buses have bike racks. What I often do is take my bike on the bus to work, then ride home. I get a 36K ride afternoon ride in, and I'm not a sweaty mess at work. Obviously this would depend on many factors specific to your situation, but it's worth considering. 

I recently switched the pedals on my road bike over to the SPD clipless system. The pedals I got have an adjustable spring. Tightening the spring increases the force required to twist one's foot out, while loosening it does the opposite. Initially, I set the tightness as low as it would go. I have ridden the bike every day in the last week without issue, and without even the prophesied falling (though I'm sure my time will come!). Today, while biking uphill against a strong headwind, my foot detached from the pedal, and I nearly lost control of the bike. It seems to me that this is the result of pedaling vigorously while also swaying a bit to keep my balance. This also seems like exactly the wrong time to have one's feet come loose. This event makes me think I should tighten up the spring. At the same time, I have had several near falls where I forget to unclip at a light, but was able to quickly unclip after stopping and catch myself. I have two questions: 1: Is it more dangerous to set the tension too high or too low? 2: What sorts of schedules might be optimal for gradually tightening up the tension while learning to use the clipless pedals? 

Ensure the axle is properly placed in the dropout and the quick release is firmly closed. If it's even a little loose, the axle can shift a bit and cause the rotor to be misaligned with the caliper. 

Allegedly, shaved legs make it much easier to apply and remove embrocation, increases it effectiveness, and eliminates the "bugs crawling on skin" feeling when hairs pop back into position. FYI: embrocation is an ointment used to heat muscles & joints on chilly days. 

+1 on the recommendations to bring tools and at least two tubes. Also +1 on the recommendation to bring a second set of cycling shorts. At a minimum, bring a second set of padded liners (assuming your shorts have detachable liners). Mounting the saddle on day 2 with a cold, wet, soggy liner is unpleasant at best. Consider bringing fizzy water tablets (such as Nuun). In addition to providing much-needed electrolytes, they help mask the taste of any hose water you get along the way. You'll probably need a pair of padded gloves. You'll be spending a lot of time holding the handlebars, and your hands will definitely get tired (and possibly raw) if unprotected. Ibuprofen is your friend after a long day in the saddle. 

Is it safe to cycle while holding an Umbrella? Obviously it's at least a little less safe than biking without holding something in your left (or right) hand. But how much more dangerous is it? Specifically, suppose that I'm biking on a flat-ish, smooth surface, on a day with almost no wind (say 5km/h), at moderate speeds (say 15km/h) and in enough rain that the umbrella is helpful. I commute by bike every day, and have recently moved to a new location where the weather often produces these conditions, and where the folding bike and roads I ride on often lead to the above scenario. Recently I have begun riding with an umbrella in hand after observing several other riders doing so, and have fallen off thrice while learning, producing one minor injury to my toe. For comparison, I had one fall and no injuries while learning to use clipless pedals, and one other injury-free fall in the last 5 years. What I really want to know is this: Assuming someone does this regularly (presumably like the other riders I see), is someone who rides in the conditions mentioned above 10% more likely to suffer a serious accident or 10 times more likely? In the former case, I view the enjoyment / safety tradeoff as being clearly in favor of the umbrella, in the latter I take the opposite view and will stop doing it. Ideally I'd like to see a study on the subject, but since such a thing doesn't exist (AFAIK), guesswork or anecdotes will suffice.
