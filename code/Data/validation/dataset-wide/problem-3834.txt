By interpolation $e^{tA}$ will be bounded on $L^p(X,\mu)$ for $2 \leq p \leq \infty$. Then the dual of $e^{tA}$ will be bounded on $L^p(X,\mu)$ for $1 < p \leq 2$; but since $A$ is self-adjoint this is just $e^{tA}$ itself. (I think there are no problems with this argument but I'm not 100% sure) I'm not sure if you can say anything about boundedness on $L^1$. However, I haven't used the assumptions of finite measure or contractivity, so maybe these can be used. 

Suppose $\Omega$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure space (I'm happy to take $\Omega = \mathbb{N}$) and let $X$ be a Banach space. It's pretty well known that the Banach dual of $L^\infty(\Omega)$ can be identified with the space of finitely additive measures of bounded variation on $\Omega$, but is there a corresponding result for the Bochner space $L^\infty(\Omega;X)$? Edit: for clarity, I define $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{N};X)$ to be the space of all bounded functions $\mathbb{N} \to X$. When $X$ is infinite dimensional, the set of simple functions (i.e. functions with finite range) is not dense in $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{N};X)$, because bounded sets in $X$ are not totally bounded. I only know the answer to this question in the `trivial' case where $X = L^\infty(\Omega)$ for some $\Omega$. 

For $p,q \in (0,\infty)$ and $s \in \mathbb{R}$, one can define certain function spaces, $B_s^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $F_s^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces respectively. The definition of these spaces is a bit complicated, and it probably won't offer any new insight to anybody who hasn't already considered these spaces, but it can be found for example in Triebel's 'Theory of Function Spaces II' (section 2.3.1) or Grafakos' 'Modern Fourier Analysis' (section 6.5.1). For both of these spaces, one can rightfully refer to $p$ as the 'integrability index' and to $s$ as the 'regularity index'; for example, the spaces $F_s^{p,2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ are equivalent to the Sobolev spaces $W_s^{p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and one can justify the integrability/regularity interpretations when $q \neq 2$ or for the spaces $B^{p,q}_s(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Is there a simple way of describing the role of the $q$ index? Or are stuck with referring to it as 'the third index'? 

I don't know how one can tackle the following kind of question, so any hint is welcome. I formulate a precise question in order to fix ideas, but it is to be considered as an example out of a more general class. Example: Can one embed Petersen's graph in $\mathbb R^4$ in such a way that all edges are mapped to segments (of not necessarily equal lenght) and each pair of adjacent segments forms an angle of $2\pi/3$ ? The question can be generalized in the following way, to give a wider class of questions: 

I apologize if the question is a well-known theorem, but I'm just starting to learn about laminations, so I don't know much. The question is roughly, if interval exchange maps have an underlying closed smooth surface, or if not, what is known about conditions on that. Now I try to be more precise. Usual interval exchange functions are bijective functions $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z=S^1\to S^1$ which are piecewise translations where "piecewise" is defined using a finite partition of $S^1$ in segments $s_i$. Given a interval exchange function $\phi:S^1\to S^1$ one can consider its suspension $S_\phi=[0,1]\times S^1/\sim$ where the nontrivial identifications are $(0,x)\sim (1,\phi(x))$. Then one has a smooth 1-dimensional structure on $S_\phi$, given by the differentiable structure on $[0,1]$, which can be extended with continuity through the identifications. In the $S^1$-direction there is just some piecewise $C^1$-structure on the pieces $]0,1[\times s_i$, since $\phi$ is not even assumed to be continuous. Then if I understood correctly one defines $\partial S_\phi=\cup_i [0,1]\times\partial s_i/\sim$, and this set is an union of (topological but not $C^1$, since there are cusps) copies of $S^1$. Then one obtains a surface by gluing some annuli to these circles. The question is if there is some way of obtaining a smooth surface in this way. The case where the lenghts of $s_i$ are rational and $\phi$ is piecewise equal to translations by rational numbers is simple (one refined the segments and gets a longer, smooth, boundary), so I am interested if there is a result in the other case. 

The answer is no: In general this is not enough information to conclude $\xi$ is pure exact. This question is discussed in detail in T.Y. Lam's book "Lectures on Modules and Rings", at the end of Section 4. I recommend reading the presentation there, but I can summarize the process of obtaining a counterexample. Start with a nonzero commutative ring $R$ for which the family $\mathcal{F}$ of all nonzero ideals has trivial intersection. Then set $A = R$ and $B=\prod_{I \in \mathcal{F}} R/I$, with $i : A \rightarrow B$ the natural map. Then $i$ is injective, and one shows that it remains injective after tensoring with any $R/I$ (4.95 in LMR). So the sequence $\xi: 0\rightarrow A \rightarrow B \rightarrow B/A \rightarrow 0$ satisfies your assumptions. Next, one can show that $i \otimes_R N$ is not injective when $N$ is any finitely presented left $R$-module with $\bigcap_{I\in \mathcal{F}} IN \neq 0$ (4.96 in LMR). For an explicit counterexample Lam applies the above to $R=k[x,y]/(x^2,xy,y^2)$ over a field $k$, where $N=k^3$ with $x$ and $y$ acting via $x(a,b,c) = (0,0,a)$ and $y(a,b,c) = (0,0,b)$. (Note $N$ is the indecomposable injective $R$-module.) Finally, Lam notes that any $\xi : 0\rightarrow A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow 0$ with $\xi \otimes_R R/I$ exact for all ideals $I$ and $B$ projective is pure exact. This is a result of Fieldhouse, which is also included as an exercise. 

Not in general, although there may be some classes of algebras where it holds. For a simple counterexample $A$ consider the path algebra (over an infinite field) of the quiver $$1 \stackrel{a, b}\Rightarrow 2 \stackrel{c}{\rightarrow} 3$$ modulo the relation $ca=0$. This algebra has global dimension 2, so in particular the subcategory of modules of finite projective dimension is all of $A$-mod, which is contravariantly finite. However, the simple module $S_1$ has no right-approximation by a module of projective dimension $\leq 1$, so $P_1$ is not contravariantly finite. Informally, one sees there is a one-parameter family of nonisomorphic indecomposables with dimension vector (1,1,0), each of which (with one exception) has projective dimension 1, and maps onto $S_1$. Then one can check that there is no single finite-dimensional module of projective dimension 1 through which all of these maps can factor. I believe that one can make this argument more rigorous (but I haven't checked the details) by using the fact that this algebra $A$ is stably equivalent (by constructing a node) to the algebra $\Lambda$ studied by Igusa, Smalo and Todorov in their paper "Finite projectivity and contravariant finiteness," Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 109 (1990), no. 4, 937-941. 

On a noncompact Riemannian manifold $M$, the $L^2$-spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$ sits inside $\mathbb{R}$ (by self-adjointness), either to the left or to the right of $0$ depending on sign convention. I know that under various curvature assumptions one can show that the $L^p$-spectrum is equal to the $L^2$-spectrum for $p \neq 2$. Without making any geometric assumptions on $M$, is it possible to conclude that the $L^p$-spectrum of $\Delta$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$? If not, is there anything we can say about the $L^p$-spectrum without having to make any additional assumptions? 

Let $(X,d,\mu)$ be a metric measure space (i.e. $(X,d)$ is a metric space and $\mu$ is a Borel measure on $X$). Let's say that $X$ is doubling if there exists a constant $C \geq 1$ such that $0 < \mu(B(x,2r)) \leq C\mu(B(x,r)) < \infty$ for all $x \in X$ and $r > 0$ (note the finiteness and positivity conditions which don't always appear in this definition). The metric space $(X,d)$ is Polish if it is separable and completely metrisable (i.e. there exists a complete metric, not necessarily $d$, which determines the same topology). Are there any examples of metric measure spaces $(X,d,\mu)$ which are doubling but not Polish? One can prove that if $\mu(B(x,r)) \in (0,\infty)$ for all $x \in X$ and $r > 0$, then $(X,d)$ is separable, so we only need to concern ourselves with complete metrisability. (I haven't seen this in the literature anywhere, so I have no idea if this is already known, but I have a proof of my own.) My approach to this problem was to take a non-Polish metric space which is geometrically doubling (every ball can be covered by uniformly finitely many balls of half the radius) and invoke the theorem which guarantees the existence of a doubling measure (Theorem 13.3 in Heinonen's Lectures on Analysis on Metric Spaces). But alas, a key hypothesis of this theorem is that $(X,d)$ is complete (hence Polish), so this doesn't work. 

I heard a rumor that there exists a proof by Moser-style iteration of the $C^{0,\alpha}$-regularity for $W^{1,2}$-solutions $u$ to elliptic equations with measurable coefficients which does not rely on the John-Nirenberg lemma. I was wondering if somebody can point out a reference for that proof, or a reason why the John-Nirenberg lemma cannot be truly avoided (or both!). 

Let $E$ have finite perimeter in $\mathbb R^n$. Consider the minimization of $$P(B)-\int_{\mathbb R^n\setminus L}|D\chi_E|$$ among the sets $B$ of finite perimeter differing from $E$ only inside $L$ (the negative piece of the minimized quantity is not influent, since it does not depend on $B$, but it's there to stress the idea that we care just about the perimeter inside $L$). Let $\bar E$ be the minimizer, and that the minimum is not zero. Suppose also that $L$ has finite perimeter. I'm looking for a geometrically inspired way for defining a function $\Psi$ which sends a piece (I would like to ask "all" but it might be unfeasible) of $\mathcal FL\cap E$ to $\mathcal F\bar E\cap L$ bijectively, is $H^{n-1}$-measurable and decreases (more precisely, does not increase) $(n-1)$-dimensional area. The idea should be that $\Psi$ be some kind of projection. In the case that $L$ is a ball and $E$ is a thin rectangle around its diameter it is clear that usual projections don't quite work. On the other hand, such a map surely exists, by the consideration that the area of the target is smaller than the one of the domain, and both of them are rectifiable. My question is if there is a famous geometric/constructive way of doing it, perhaps using some minimization principle, a flow, etc., or under more restrictive hypotheses on $L$. 

Suppose given a $1$-separated net $\Gamma\subset\mathbb R^2$. Is it true or false that there exists $\delta>0$ and a $\delta$-isoradial graph containing $\Gamma$ as a subset of its vertices? (I am also interested in partial results in this direction.) edit: a $\delta$-isoradial graph in $\mathbb R^2$ is a graph each of whose faces is a finite polygon inscribed in some circle of radius $\delta$. edit2: A case where the answer is "yes": if we have a graph whose faces are $\delta$-rhombi then by considering only odd vertices gives us an isoradial graph. It will help to consider such graphs instead of $\delta$-isoradial ones. If $\Gamma$ is included in the graph of a continuous function $G_f:=\{(x,f(x)):x\in\mathbb R\}$ then we may approximate $G_f$ by a polygonal $\delta$-path $P$ which comes from a graph of a function $\tilde f$ and contains $\Gamma$ as a subset of its odd vertices. Now extend $P$ to a path of $\delta$-rhombi and then extend to a $\delta$-rhombic tiling of $\mathbb R^2$ e.g. by periodicity. 

To the best of my knowledge, this is an open problem. There are no known examples where $\mbox{mod-}A$ is periodic (say, with a common period $n$ for all modules), but $\Omega^n$ is not isomorphic to the identity functor on the stable category. In fact, $\mbox{mod-}A$ being periodic may well imply that $A$ is a periodic algebra, meaning that $A$ has a periodic projective resolution as a module over its enveloping algebra. This is another open question. Examples where this happens include the preprojective algebras of Dynkin type and generalized Dynkin type, and their deformations [K. Erdmann, A. Skowronski. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 359 (2007), no. 6, 2625--2650], and all self-injective algebras of finite representation type [J. Pure Appl. Algebra 214 (2010), no. 6, 990–1000]. One class of examples where $\mbox{mod-}A$ is periodic, but it is not known (at least to me) whether $\Omega$ has finite order or not, is the so-called higher preprojective algebras studied by O. Iyama and S. Oppermann [arXiv:0912.3412v1]. Here, I believe the problem is connected to the question of whether the Nakayama automorphism has finite order. 

Yes $D$ must be finite-dimensional over $F$. This follows from a Theorem of Kaplansky's that I found in Herstein's monograph "Noncommutative Rings". The first step is to show that an algebraic algebra of bounded degree satisfies a polynomial identity (see Lemma 6.2.3 in Herstein), i.e., is a P.I. algebra. Note, however, that the degree of this polynomial identity may be larger than the degree of the algebra, as defined in the question. Then since a division algebra $D$ is primitive, one can use: 

I believe I had this exact same question some time ago. Auslander and Reiten attribute this result to a paper of Auslander and Green. I still have the latter paper, but can no longer find where this result is in that paper. From my old notes, it looks like I concluded that this proposition is misstated in Auslander and Reiten's paper. Most likely, they may have meant to write "strong tilting module", rather than strong cotilting module. In your example of $A=kA_2$, the strong tilting module is $DA$, and this contains all simple $A$ modules (as submodules) on both sides. Alternatively, for strong cotilting modules, I believe the proper statement is the dual that every simple $\Gamma^{op}$-module is a quotient of $T_{\Gamma}$. If you want to see a proof of the statement for strong tilting modules, see Prop 7.1 in the paper $URL$
