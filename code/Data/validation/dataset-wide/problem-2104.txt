Must say that I profoundly dislike change for the sake of change, hate management fads and buzzwords. Anything that upsets the established routine and standard operating procedures in the workplace lowers productivity and is immediately detrimental to the bottom line while positive effects (if any) are delayed. Think about it. EDIT: As usual, changes are a double-edged sword. If you significantly lag behind the bleeding edge in technology, you very often lose. If you make continuous changes to the way your organization works, people around you will be put under stress and possibly lose trust. The best solution to the technological part of the problem is when employees are used to keeping up with the state-of-the-art. Unfortunately, it doesn't work out for the internal structure and procedures - here, some degree of stability and freedom from superficial management-inspired "reorganizations" are necessary to be productive. 

Computational geometry is quite far from being purely theoretical. Your first step should be building a list of companies that have active projects with some computational geometry component. Use CiteSeerX to find authors of top papers and their corporate affiliations. Alternatively, just run a query on SeerSeer to get the list of top "experts" out of the box. Here's the query I ran for you: $URL$ Then look for open positions in the companies in the list that match your skill set. You can also send cv's without open positions as a last resort. 

I'll present some information from studies on childhood bullying, because while you're not a child, honestly, the dynamics are the same—you're being bullied and it's bothering you. 

I don't see why you can't just put a very bland face on it. It's not a feather in your cap of course, and likely can't be used to promote your skills, but there's no reason it has to be a big hole or even all that mysterious. Select some of the elements of your work that were harmless, and make them the whole job. You had to have done, at least a few times, simple things, or things that can have a good face put on them. You were an office assistant. A driver. You sent faxes. You delivered communications to clients. You were a personal attendant. And so on. The business name can be very bland, too. Something like "Private Construction Company" or "Family Business". You can be honest that it was a family business and they're peculiar about the details of their exact identity not being broadcast. There are many such kinds of operations that are perfectly legitimate. I once worked legitimately for a company for 18 months or so, where half the employees (3 or 4 of them) reported for work daily to the CEO's own apartment, and sat at desks in her living room! Just discuss it in general terms, as honestly as you can, and don't let on that there was anything unusual about it. For someone with as little experience as you, this will not be such a bad thing. 

First off, if you provide your old boss with enough actionable information, he/she may be tempted to play a dirty joke on you. He/she is a jolly good fellow, so don't lead him/her to temptation. You have to part on good terms (with perhaps a round of beers for your ex-colleagues and direct boss for all the good ole' days you've spent with them). Second, you may be tempted by a counter-offer. We'll give you a hefty raise, a better health insurance plan, a new office, whatever. The obvious conclusion for us is you can be easily swayed and bought - not good for your long-term career prospects. You've made up your mind, there is precious little that can make you re-think your decision. Third, if your new employer is in the same industry (I assume there is no binding "no-compete clause") you have to be loyal to the new company and keep things that may hurt its business well under your stetson... 

Now, back to the layouts you have drawn: TL;DR - B is better than A, A is better than C WHY? Sitting face to face with each other (layout A) is not good for concentration if your vis-a-vis is texting, eating, drinking, drawing, or doing anything else. As Jeff O said, if you need a quick conference in the B layout, people just turn around. Otherwise it is close to ideal. Everybody can see people who enter through the door with a slight turn of the head. The C layout creates two kinds of inequality: folks sitting with their backs to the window (let's call them and ) cannot see the sky without a 180-deg turn, but can (or are made to) observe their colleagues. Of course C is a version of A, so you get less concentration as well. In C, evacuation routes for the and are worse than for and . Peopleware really is recommended reading here! And a note: for office work you don't have to observe what the others are doing, for co-ordination you can and should communicate verbally instead (or, if concentration requirement is paramount, you can use e-mail and other non-intrusive methods). 

I have been working with an external recruitment agency (they don't represent one company in particular). The other day a recruiter contacted me with a job opening they needed to fill quickly. He asked how much I make at my current job and I'm pretty sure he just added a small amount to it and say that's what the new company pays. I kind of thought the recruiter was "on my side" but I guess it's in their interest to find the lowest cost candidates to fill a position for a company? Should current pay or salary expectations be given to recruiters at all? I normally wouldn't give it to an internal recruiter of a particular company but I guess external is the same. In my area it seems the use of external recruitment agencies is very popular. On one hand they act like they are there to help you get a job, on the other hand they are assessing your skills to see if you would fit the position. I find it hard to tell whether to let recruiters know about my weaknesses so they can help prepare me for the interview, or if I should treat speaking to them like an interview itself and only highlight my strengths. 

In addition to what was said by Paul Hiemstra: Xaisoft, at each level of seniority/hierarchy there is a limit to things you can change. A junior developer/engineer can suggest changes to routines, but s/he has to be perceived as a very bright person by almost all stakeholders for the change to succeed. As your experience grows, the scope of feasible changes expands. But the greatest potential to foster changes comes with middle-level management positions. You have to ask yourself, though: 

Okay, you are elated you have found a new job and are moving on. The sun is shining and your old boss is gently prodding you to find out the items you mentioned. It's a trifle, and you will lose nothing by answering, right? WRONG! Please pause to think about the following: 

Now, the way they handle this is abysmal. Assuming the worst, they botched their task and have shown themselves to be cheapskates. First, they leaked the decision, and second, they chose you instead of an external consultant to interview the next "IT person" for the firm. Please bear in mind that you cannot know for sure whether the rumors are actually true. Thus, your first course of action can be (surprise!) going to your supervisor and asking a direct question about the rumors. You have the right to be kept informed about your career prospects. Most people feel uncomfortable while lying in a face-to-face meeting, you should watch for signs carefully. Only after getting the essential information directly or indirectly you can plan your next step. If the worst fears of yours are not mere figments of imagination, you always have the option of jumping ship and filing the resignation letter without having to go through the unwarranted pain and hassle of interviewing your replacement. 

It probably is appropriate to somewhat directly address the behavior itself, and why you're making somewhat of a big deal out of it. You might consider something like this: 

There's a very old saying, "A sin confessed is half forgiven." (credited to J. Florio by the 1884 book Day's Collacon: an Encyclopaedia of Prose Quotations.) The only thing worse than a missed deadline is a surprise missed deadline. Tell them as soon as possible, because delaying can only make it worse. 

These options should help you find the middle ground between doing it all yourself and getting the CEO's direct help. Think about this answer to your question compared with other answers you were given. Which ones were the most helpful? Being given a short list of options to choose from is a great way to give your requesters most of what they wanted, while still pushing some of the responsibility back to them when you can't do it all yourself. 

If the interns says he's just there to screw around, then speak with management to end his internship. You're wasting your time. If he says he's there to learn, then say something like this: 

If you do want to resist him—I'd think carefully before setting up a big war or making a big insult, especially because these can show you're bothered which is not a good idea—but you could say something along the lines of "[shrug] doesn't it make sense to you that each person uses as big a password as he's capable of remembering?" Then turn away and act like you've dismissed him—get busy with something job-related. If he says something more, say "what, you're still here? Dude, don't you have work you should be doing?" then dismissively turn your back again. Walk away from your desk or involve someone else in conversation, pretending he's not there. Make sure you say everything in as low a tone of voice as possible, that falls at the end instead of rising. Go watch the video The Impact of Tonality and use it! There are many other videos by that same YouTube channel, Charisma Matrix, that could help you.
