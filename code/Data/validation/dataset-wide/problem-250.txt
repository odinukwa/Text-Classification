You may be interested in this article, which is about enhancing Earth own magnetosphere, but can obviously be applied to any other celestial body. It has a lot if information and is a recommended reading; here is an Executive Summary (for the part of interest): 

If it is possible to catch the disease and it is not possible to demonstrate infection was voluntary, then there might be some benefit from a health care program, possibly even a lifetime maintenance that someone could weigh against the obvious drawbacks. 

Carbohydrates are actually stored in our body as glycogen in the liver (mainly) and in muscles (much less and is generally not made available outside the muscle itself). This storage implies also storing a large quantity of water (3..4 times the amount of glycogen). There is no storage for proteins beside the muscle themselves. Note that a certain amount of protein intake is required otherwise our body would start to "eat" (anabolyze) muscle tissue. Note also that converting proteins in energy is much less efficient and thus using them to store energy is not advised. Storing large quantities of glycogen in the liver has adverse effects to liver functionality, so you need to find some solution: 

NOTE: this schema wouldn't work well for races (like our own) that actually shield populace from natural selection by preserving and allowing to mate (almost) everybody thinking it's a "natural right" (while it's an "artificial right", of course). 

... paranoid? A gigantic spaceship appeared few days after release of "Independence Day". They were greeted by a salvo of nuclear weapons, but they hadn't any "force shield". 

You cannot, at least not without some kind of anchorage. Fliers fly in a reference medium (air) and they are displaced with it. Even modern planes have very different flight times when flying Europe to USA or vice versa, due to prevailing winds at cruise altitude. Without engines an airship will soon (after inertia has been overcome) travel with the wind and cannot use it for anything, regardless of shape and possible "sails". Not only you cannot "sail into the wind", but You can't even deflect a few degrees from wind direction. Current fliers go where they please because engines move them with respect of surrounding air. To use the force of the wind you need some kind of anchor to ground and some form of "rail" performing essentially the same function of a ship's keel. Think of a kite: it flies while you provide traction on the rope; if you let it go it will fall like a dead leaf. 

You don't need to look far. Our bodies manufacture vitamin D when the sun's ultraviolet B (UVB) rays interact with 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) present in the skin. This is a very specific and real kind of photosynthesis. 

That's an "engineer approach to archery"... utterly useless. Have a look to this and/or this. The two nice videos essentially try to show the real feat with "professional" archery has nothing to do with how fast you manage to nock the arrow, because this can be done quite fast, given a certain amount of training. Real problems are: 

Having anyone to fight underwater with the same strategy as we know it would be foolish. You can have javelins travel quite fast in water, but you need to devise some other way (e.g.: rubber bands) to throw them because using your arm or a bow will encounter too much water resistance before you manage to throw it. Much better would be to use a lance (i.e.: to swim toward your foe with weapon "on rest", so that your body inertia give it power). In general you need to rely on mass and its inertia to harm, not speed. Any projectile should be "harpoon-like", heavy with small cross-section. Any throwing device should not have swinging parts (use elastic cord, spring or compressed air). It is not by chance that spearguns are made that way. 

In any case there could be physical differences (x-ray scan, DNA test, blood samples) that could confirm suspects before apprehension. 

I won't discuss plausibility of OP premises, I will just assume all powered machines are gone in a flash, I also assume purely mechanical machines are mostly unaffected. Actually the percentage can even be lower than that of people not actively relying on machines. Actual percentages are very difficult to determine, but a series of things need to be factored in: 

You may want low gravity so that your planet will have higher mountains and steeper ridges. To avoid excessive erosion you may want also a thinner atmosphere. Keep things "interesting" periodically going through a large meteor shower beautifying your world with brand new craters. Thinner atmosphere would minimize "meteoric winter" effects. You can even have a "no axial tilt" planet with a "cold season" right after the meteor shower. Of course planet must be relatively young, otherwise it would already have weeded out the meteor swarm, unless there's a constant supply. 

There are good reasons why no snake actually tried the stunt, but it's theoretically possible. Secret is to have a small head start when arching over to grab the tail. Of course a perfectly round wheel won't be able to accelerate in any direction, but nothing presents the snake to partly flatten its body. What I propose is: 

It depends on energy of "optic signal". If energy is enough you can use a lens to "print" on some sensitive material. Think about a camera with a continuous ribbon of film moving continuously; When light is on it would impress on film; you can send Morse messages that way. 

Note: I see no way to confine effects to a few centimeters of ground while destroying all military underground facilities, but that's (again) beyond the point). Effects in the mean/long period are: 

So I believe that, given enough warmth, it would be possible. Note that the conditions in Cretaceous were particularly adapt because a higher greenhouse effect helped keeping warmth even through the "long nights", while a higher temperature due to closer proximity to star would have meant higher differences between "day" and "night". 

You have relatively small oceans and a huge continental landmass occluding the whole north hemisphere. This means oceanic current can only tour around southern pole with some waves going north. North pole would be buried in kilometers (vertical) of ice. It seems you have mountain ranges shielding most plains from sea influence; this means a large part of continental plains is probably going to be desert. Coastal areas would be survivable, especially the two large peninsulas near the center of the map. I would expect large hurricanes to build up in the mostly closed sea in the eastern part and, possibly in the almost fully closed central sea sea. You may have very large "torrents" flowing south from northern glaciers during the melting season (especially so in the western part). Best bet for a settlement would be the northern coast of the southern large island and the two large archipelagos. 

All gruesome alternatives, but perfectly viable, from alien viewpoint. Al they have to do to ensure balanced distribution on arrival is to stop interfering about 50 years before arrival. 

Much depends on how much fresh water they can harvest, either by wells or by desalinating sea water. To keep reasonably cool in hot climate needs a lot of water, to drink, in the first place, but also to cool down other things (animals and plants) less heat resilient. Human body can resist very high temperatures (up to 60°C and more, for shorter periods) with enough drinking water, but "useful" animal and plants have a narrower range. Humans and animals can also resort to bury into caves (just 20m underground temperature is almost independent from outside heat), but that is not the case for plants needing light to thrive. Being an "ancient" civilization it doesn't (supposedly) have access to means to pull cold water from some hundred meter undersea (close to 4°C), so they should resort to keep wet some large overhead cloth; evaporation can lower temperature under it more than 10°C, which may be enough... but will require a lot of water (using sea water is dangerous for salt accumulation which won't be healthy for plants). 

Bottom line: if You really need these "Pokemon-on-steroids" you'll get a terrorism problem, more likely than a gull-blown World-War. Further hints need details on specifics of Your world. 

Main problem with "normal" batteries and/or supercapacitors and/or flywheels is they are inherently very dangerous because: 

I think you have better to try to lie low and hit the "crime" (I would like to have a meaningful and usable definition of that word) indirectly, making your work look like "bad luck" of the criminal (e.g.: puncture a tire of an escaping car). Otherwise you've better to surrender to whatever Government Agency you like and have them use you as they please. 

First of all, if you want to start from raw elements, it won't be "a small amount of power"; it will be a lot of power. To be useful as food whatever you produce must contain energy and you'll have to supply it to synthesize the "product". Second our food can't be "chemically simple". We need, at the very least, sugars (about the simplest compound needed), some fats, amino-acids and vitamins. These compounds start at molecular weight 180 Da (glucose) and go up to the sky (proteins with over 3 MDa are known). Keeping things simple, however (i.e.: confining ourselves to essential molecules, with weight <= 1357 Da (B12)), will not produce something with acceptable taste and texture. Once you have the basics (essential nutrients) choosing flavors is a matter of taste. 

You can turn coal into oil; process is called liquefaction. It is not currently economically useful, but it's not very complex and any steampunk technology can do it. Note here still are many open-sky or otherwise not very deep coal mines that would be accessible to post-apocalyptic setting (not to mention coal can be manufactured from wood), where oil is much more difficult to reach. 

"Rich" is a relative term, not an absolute one. In western countries people is considered "poor" if they cannot afford to change the cellphone yearly. A century ago poor people could have problems putting a loaf of bread on the table. You will never be able to have a large country composed only by rich people because there always be a stratification (very small, non-self-sufficient countries are possible (e.g.: Kuwait or Qatar), but only if you consider all service providers as "foreign workers" not really part of the country). 

It is not really clear what you exactly mean by "it will stay relatively put in regard to Earth" (I also failed to understand the linked reference). 

In orbit You would have no gravity, but You have air pressure, this means bubbles would form, more or less, as they do here on stable ground. Main difference would be bubbles won't try to "rise" because they can't decide what direction is "up" ;) In truth the liquid (water, Coke, whatever) that won't try to go "down" dislodging the lighter gas. Since there's no gravity keeping the liquid down it is very unlikely someone is crazy enough to leave a liquid mass "unattended" (carbonation not withstanding). Left to itself a liquid mass is held together only by surface tension (we ignore gravity pull, which is several orders of magnitude weaker). This is more than enough to hold together droplets, but is easily overcome as mass increases and the spherical drop undergoes larger destabilizing forces. In an ideal world (absolutely no perturbation) liquid would assume a spherical form to minimize surface. Carbonation would add bubbles enlarging the sphere, but bubbles would remain static due to liquid viscosity (they are far too large to participate to Brownian movements). If, however, two bubbles would came in contact (come to a distance of a few intermolecular lengths) then the bubbles would fuse together (or release the gas outside the sphere, if near surface). I repeat: this is not realistic for sizeable masses of liquid as the "no perturbation" clause would be very difficult to maintain. A sealed can would contain a mixture of liquid and gas not separated by sedimentation due to gravity. Opening such a can would release (some of) the gas in liquid solution with the net effect of increasing the volume of the mixture, propelling it from the opening (and pushing the can in opposite direction). Highly carbonated liquids would resemble a foam, but would decay due to bubbles being near enough to interact (liquid is in movement). Anyone doing such an experiment in a real space station would have to clean the mess first and then face consequences. 

To "detect particular strains of DNA" you need to go "close and personal"; I cannot imagine being able to do it from orbit. You are asking for genotype (as opposed to phenotype) detection and that is best addressed with some kind of genetic-aware weapon such as a virus. You can, if your plot requires that, actually combine the two things: 

As a reference (less extreme, but...) you can look at two largish and very similar islands in Mediterranean: Sardinia and Corse. Sardinia is not desert, but very arid, while corse had large and high forests. Both climate and geology is similar. What happened? Man happened. Both islands were covered by forests but, while Corse was not meddled too much, Sardinia forest were burned down to make pasture for sheep and goats. This changed completely climate because while in Corse land is colder then sea (due to forests) in Sardinia land is much hotter than surrounding sea. This fact inverts prevalent air circulation and while in Corse sea humidity rises and is sucked down over land, raining on it, in Sardinia you have the reverse: normal circulation is hot air rising on land taking with it the scant humidity present and then going to discharge rain on sea. To have an island with desert climate is enough to cut all (or good part) of forests on it; if there is enough sunshine it will do the rest of transformation.
