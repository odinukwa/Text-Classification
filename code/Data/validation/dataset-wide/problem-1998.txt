Your question assumes that the only thing of value that you can learn from this job is the programming language that is being used there. You also don't say if it's a new language that does not have a lot of adoption anywhere (yet?), an old language that's on its way out, or simply an obscure one. To some degree this doesn't matter. By doing well at this job you would demonstrate to a future employer that you can learn new things. This has value. There may be opportunities to develop project management, people management or technical architect skills from this role. Again, this has value. Don't forget salary. This is compensation for the work you're doing and if the job involves working with a obscure or dead-end language and the pay is higher to compensate for this, then that seems like a reasonable adjustment to me. If you develop skills in an obscure area then this might increase your value to future employees. I'm a network/systems architect rather than a programmer these days and I still get calls from people who wish to offer me daft sums of money to babysit old mainframes. While I don't see my career heading in that direction, it's a nice set of skills to fall back on. Only you can decide if the value of these areas is enough to make up for your worries. If you're worried about losing your edge in more popular technologies in the meantime then you can work on your own projects or contribute to an open source project that uses the appropriate language. 

I think that most employers these days regard being well groomed in whatever style you choose to wear your hair as more important than the style itself, so for someone who was going bald anyway, a properly shaven head may actually be the better choice anyway. If you're otherwise well presented and behave in a professional manner then I seriously doubt that the majority of employers would even notice a shaven head as anything worth commenting on. If anyone does ask then explain its connected to your personal faith and beliefs. I think that most employers would certainly stop objecting at this point and I'm assuming that if they didn't accept this then you wouldn't want to work for them anyway. 

I can tell you that, for me, having Mensa on a resume would act as somewhat of a negative from a hiring point of view. I deal with and hire highly educated and highly capable people almost exclusively (post doc to masters), and this would not be a good indicator of a team player in my estimation. It would also not help with mediocre academics, it would actually hurt because I would judge that the person will quickly get bored with the less interesting stuff I have to get them to do, and will just phone it in, like they did before. Others may well feel differently (if you have intelligence, as it were, that the interviewer is also a Mensa member, it might help). I'd rather see some kind of extracurricular activity than a club membership (maybe in your case you've contributed to open source or answered SE questions). 

There is a reason why people are issued offices, and it's not just for the ego boost. Partly it's so conversations (personal and on the phone) can be private, but also typically we might have confidential documents such as performance reviews and such like around when we're not. I would say lock the door and have a slot installed for papers, if you think that's necessary. Management should be on your side on this. 

This being <'current year'>, I would suggest sending a Linkedin invitation to your new CEO, and mentioning in the invitation that you are looking forward to meeting them. I would not suggest otherwise approaching him or her personally before arriving on their doorstep. By the way, if you are the paranoid sort, there is always a small chance that the CEO is unaware that you were hired, did not approve it, and she or he will cancel your appointment. Less likely when your presence is a fait accompli. Sounds silly, but I've seen this (and rather worse) in startups. 

If he's already mentally disengaged from the company to the extent you outline in your post then I would have thought you would be delighted to see him off work instead of furthering the toxic atmosphere in the office. You need to take some responsibility for this toxic atmosphere. I don't know what originally happened to drive your 'best employee' to this, and that should be addressed too, but you should have dealt with this before things deteriorated to the point where they're spending half their time in the office blatantly not working. The fact that they've been allowed to get away with this sends a very poor message to the rest of your team. Your steps to prevent this happening again, therefore, are two-fold: 

I've worked for my current employer for 17 years and counting, so clearly I don't favour leaving "just because". I am however currently looking for my next career step and I'm not finding my tenure at my current employer to be an issue because of how I take care to present it. I think rather than worrying about how long you should work for an employer in terms of years, think in terms of personal development and career progression: If you can achieve a goal (salary, promotion, working with x new exciting tech) with a current employer which you're very happy with then I would suggest staying there. Just be sure when you do decide to brush up your resume that you clearly delineate that you've held w number of posts with x different responsibilities, rather than just "worked at y for z years" in order to make it clear that your career has progressed steadily in one place. As to what will make you "more hireable", there's no magic number of years to have on your resume for each employer. Different companies will look for different traits and if you prefer to work at one place for a while (progressing your career within one employer, not 'stagnating') then you will obviously appeal (and will probably be more attracted to) to employers who are looking for long term hires to come in and take responsibility for a function. Equally there's value (to even that same 'long term' employer, at times) in being able to parachute someone in quickly to solve a particular technical problem or short/mid-term skills shortage... 

I am an assistant manager with authority over part of our Team ("sub-team"), mainly in supporting the actual manager. Most of my and my sub-teams' duties revolve around being a link between the Team and the rest of the company - because the manager is deeply involved in the technical execution/enforcement of the processes or with longer term projects. My manager and the developers are the main product providers, and my sub-team and I are its commercial representatives or "account managers" within the company - and I am the "public face". We handle short-term requests and help out both senior management and parallel managers in more day-to-day tasks, completing sub-projects of long term projects etc. where the top guys are too busy. For example, my master works on creating a new type of dashboard for the whole company, but as one Department X needs a new dashboard much earlier, my sub-team and I could help extrapolate an interim new dashboard for them (or some other solution) to use until the final product is developed. Or, another example, my master oversees the programming of a major software, and my sub-team goes out to gather process requirements and feedback from the various Departments X, Y & Z. There is a very strong culture of favoring speed over perfection - i.e. get a somewhat functional product/dashboard/feature out to market (external or internal) and fix issues/bugs one by one later, as and when they appear - this is adopted from some major tech companies. A consequence of this, my sub-team needs to help solve very quick, poorly tested, work wherein other Departments often spot the issues before we do. Another big catch is that my sub-team is much less technical i.e. we are not developers/programmers, but more like commercial domain experts / subject matter experts with some basic programming skills to be able to support most short term requests. Often though, also short term requests may be too hard for us and we need the input from the more technical guys on the Team. Being the Team's public face, I am often asked to explain to other Departments why something is not working, why there is a delay, why everything went wrong. While it is written nowhere that I am accountable for the whole Team's shortcomings, I wonder whether in the perception of the overall company, I am actually accountable and thus my performance may be affected if I or my subteam doesn't have the skills to address an issue and the Team is too busy... So, being the representative and not the manager of the entire Team, how much am I personally accountable if there is a shortcoming on the Team's side (which the sub-team is unable to solve)? And a sub-question may be, how can I make sure that the company doesn't perceive me as the bottleneck when in fact it is the developers? 

If you are applying for TN status, you should make sure you have the required fee and documentation (including an appropriate letter from the employer) at the border inspection, otherwise you're not going to be admitted. 

Have you fully considered any risks? I wonder if there is a possibility that your side project would be discovered and you could be accused of developing a product using company facilities to take with you to another venture. If your colleague is or is not seen to be at arms-length relationship with you it might make a difference to the overall perception. As well, if your assigned work is late or deficient in any way, the semi-authorized work could be blamed. 

You can, and should, tell them. You can also lead by example, by leaving on time yourself. If necessary, return after they have gone home. In some cultures (Japanese comes to mind) it's considered slacking to leave before your supervisor. 

To establish a contractual relationship, you should formally acknowledge the purchase order (and therefore acceptance of their terms and conditions). It costs nothing to be polite when doing it. Without the acceptance they're actually left hanging as to whether you're really engaged, because usually the P.O. imposes additional conditions that were not present in your quote, so it's really another offer, not the acceptance of an offer. Typically you will find a lot of boiler plate text on a purchase order that is (not surprisingly) entirely in the favor of the purchaser-- it's worth reading it and seeing just what you are agreeing to. At some point you might want to have a lawyer draft up a pro forma contract that cancels out the most egregious of that B.S. If you're in a field where large amounts of value are being handled, or safety could be an issue, you need to do that first.
