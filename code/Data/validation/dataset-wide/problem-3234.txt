There's no clear-cut definitive answer for this as most battles involved mass ranks of soldiers and not individual targets. Archers would be trained to shoot at groups of enemy and not individuals, at least not at any great range. The English/Welsh Longbow of the early 15th century, had a range of up to 350 yds or so, but it was only considered effective at up to around 200 yds. This doesn't take into account armour worn by the enemy. For example a knight in full plate armour would probably be impervious to the Longbow at ranges of much above 50 yds, depending on the type of arrowhead used. $URL$ $URL$ 

Both Germany and Great Britain had plans to invade Ireland. Germany couldn't launch such an attack as they lacked the naval power to do it, as they knew that the Royal Navy would intervene. For the same reason they never tried to invade Great Britain, an invasion of Ireland would have been even more difficult due to the distances involved, they would have had few aircraft capable of operating at the distances required while the British would have been able to send forces from Wales and South West England for example. Britain's plans to invade would be in response to any German invasion, so they were never required to actually invade. 

The site around Troy was not continuously inhabited. Troy VII, what we believe is the one associated with the famous Bronze Age Troy, was deserted in the mid-10th century BC, followed by the establishment of Troy VIII around 700 BC. That's plenty of time for people to forget about what happened before. The inhabitants may not be the same people either, which means oral traditions may be lost. The legend only survived in Ancient Greece, after all. 

The question should be asked backwards: why did the US use tripwire deterrence in South Korea? Stationing troops in foreign soil should be considered unusual. In the case of tripwire deterrence, a nation deliberately places her troops in harm's way so that they are sacrificed when the host nation is attacked. The death of her own troops then creates a strong political will to retaliate. The US uses tripwire deterrence mainly in Central Europe, but also in South Korea. This was not really necessary for China. China is an authoritarian regime that can more easily deploy her troops, politically speaking. During the Korean War, China intervened without having any of her troops killed or territory invaded first. The decision to intervene was based on UN encroachment in Korea and among members of China's Politburo. 

Operation Barbarossa was arguably the main event of World War - had Germany succeeded, they could possibly have gone on to win the war. They ultimately failed, but what were the major reasons for this failure? Was the whole operation doomed from the start? 

How was Russian AFV production affected by the relocation of factories during WWII, post the German invasion of 1941? They went on to out-produce the Germans by around 3-1 in tanks from 1942 onwards. Assuming that the Russians hadn't relocated their factories, how would AFV production have been affected on both sides? Could the Germans have used captured tank factories to produce their own tanks? Did the Germans consider bombing "Tankograd"? - It is a ~2k mile round trip from Moscow, so did they even have the capability? (I am aware the He-177 had nearly that range) 

This page has a lot of information on how to interpret those characters. The first two characters give the era, and the second two the type of coin. This coin is a 通寶 tongbao. 

Wikipedia also suggests that it was due to bickering warlords who could not agree on whose divisions would be merged or disbanded, also citing corruption as a cause: 

A lot of this would sound familiar to students of Sun Tzu, with some Roman flairs owing to their extreme level of rationalisation, like the square/rectangular camp shape. 

If you were a well-to-do ancient Roman funding the construction of an aqueduct, it would probably be called philanthropy. 

This looks like a Chinese square hole coin; the four characters identify its type and era. They are read in the order North-South-East-West, and reads: 

With the British as sponsors, and later the US as a protector, Saudi Arabia has been relatively safe from its lessor neighbors. It also maintains a fairly substantial military. So your opening statement is shown to be false. If you mean "Why was Arabia never invaded?", the premise is false: The north-western part, was invaded and conquered by the Romans. 

Battle of the Alamo is certainly remembered in Texas, and they certainly lost that battle. Pearl Harbor was a major loss to the United States, and is still commemorated annually. In these two cases the prior losses became rallying cries in future battles, which were victories. The Romans lost the Battle of the Caudine Forks, 321 BC, for which the humiliating surrender was remembered for centuries. The direct result was that the Romans fought the Samnites harder than ever, to retrieve their honor. The running theme is to remember your martyrs. For a less famous battle, consider "Remember the Raisin!" which was the battle cry of William Henry Harrison's Northwestern Army, War of 1812; in remembrance of the Battle of the River Raisin, January 18-23, 1813, and the subsequent massacre of the wounded, was seared into the American memory for a generation. "Remember the Raisin!" was the Kentucky militia's war cry at the Battle of the Thames, Oct 5, 1813, where General Proctor's British and Indian forces were dealt a heavy defeat, and the Indian leader, Tecumseh was killed. A contemporary report on the Raisin River Massacre. 

There is no period required; the treaty only requires that the formal declaration is received before hostilities commence. The problem with Pearl Harbor was that this declaration (which was not really a formal declaration at all) was not fully received by the time of the attack - the lengthy declaration was still being transcribed via telegraph. Since 1945 this has been superceded by the United Nations Charter, where wars must be authorised by the Security Council - the Gulf War being a good example. 

There should be more detail on page 3 but that may be behind a paywall. But according to the front page summary and subheadings, it seems that the crisis was about whether to fully mobilise for the war with China; if so what changes were made in troop mobilisations, as a result of this battle? 

Attalus III Philometor, 133 BC, leaves his kingdom to Rome. The Wikipedia article on Attalus III has very little more to add. Was this voluntary? There was an uprising following the occupation by Rome, with support of the neighboring kingdoms. One neighbor, Mithridates V, was a Roman ally, though he may have been playing a double game; certainly his son was doing so during his long reign. More detail is found in the History of Rome, Vol. IV, p. 317 THE HISTORY OF ROME FROM THE FIRST PUNIC WAR TO THE DEATH OF CONSTANTINE. By B.G. NIEBUHR, published 1844. pp. 317-318 

In the book Napoleon After Waterloo: England and the St. Helena Decision By Michael John Thornton the status of Napoleon is discussed in great detail, including questions of law. There are several considerations: 

German tanks were generally inferior to Allied and Soviet designs in the pre-war years. The Germans were limited in what they could build due to the restrictions imposed upon them by the Treaty of Versailles, limiting their military. Indeed this treaty stated that they were not allowed any tanks at all but in the 1930s as they began to re-arm the treaty was largely ignored. When Germany invaded France in 1940, their tanks were inferior to the French (and British) designs as this quote from Wikipedia (and Heinz Guderian) illustrates: 

The main reason that Germany won so decisively in early battles was due to Blitzkrieg tactics and the way their armour was organised. The French tended to use their tanks in defensive positions that negated the advantage of mobility and they spread them out so tanks were not concentrated together. This meant when French tanks did engage German armour they were almost always fighting against superior numbers. The Panzer IV was the most advanced German tank produced before the war: $URL$ Total numbers were around 200 before the outbreak of war. Strangely the Germans didn't learn the lessons of the Blitzkrieg themselves and when faced with the more agile and numerous Russian T34 tank they produced slower and more expensive tanks that were always going to be outnumbered. 

Since we are comparing two civilizations, note that the Spaniards came from a world where money was long used in order to buy all manner of goods. When you had more money, you could buy whatever you wanted -- including lands, titles, and power. Even if you already had all of these, more money is always needed. None of the civilizations of the New World had developed any form of currency; in order to acquire goods one had to hold a position which deserved them. That is, the status of you and your family determined your obligations and rewards. Thus the Nahua would not have seen gold as a form of money, but rather as something that was due to the uppermost members of the status hierarchy. It was not a commodity to be bought and sold, but rather one to be used for display, as with jewelry, etc. So when the Spaniards demanded gold, they at first appeared to be just another form of highly entitled group, albeit from some distant realm. It only became apparent over time that they were merely greedy interlopers. But by then it was too late. The Nahua, and other New World civilizations, valued status; material goods followed status. There is no hierarchy of material goods when all good things come to you based upon your social status. For example, consider Aztec Religion: 

No. The Sino-Soviet split was motivated by fundamental differences in national interests, so there is little that a third party like the US could have done to influence it. Furthermore, US policy makers were wilfully ignorant of early signs of the split, which means that they did not exploit the situation until it had become abundantly clear, by the aforementioned opening of Sino-US relations by Kissenger and Nixon. Differences in national interests The Soviets and CCP were arguably playing off each other from the start, both looking out for their own interests. There are numerous examples: 

My take is that it's a casual, and perhaps older version of the Nazi salute. Hitler talks about the origin of the salute, which he refers to as the "German Salute", which is recorded in Hitler's Table Talk, a collection of notes on his monologues, which is freely available online. 

An elaboration on my comment; the bad idea came from my distant cousin, John Adams! How ‘His Highness’ George Washington Became ‘Mr. President’ 

Some societies use sunset as the end of one day, and the start of the next: this is recorded in Genesis, chapter 1; for example, the Athenians, or see the Jewish civil day Some traditional agricultural societies start the day with dawn, but Roman civil society defined the day as beginning at midnight. The day was divided into ante meridiem (am) and post meridiem (pm), where the meridian refers to local noon. Twelve hours later is midnight, the sixth hour of the night, and the beginning of the next day. 

You can search Archives.org for books with the title "Democracy in America"; then do a text search for "experiment". In the above example there are several pages containing "experiment"; p.23 is the last page of chapter 1, and the final paragraph begins "In that land the great experiment ...". This is the New Edition, translated by Henry Reeve, C.B., published in 1889. This later version, published 1900, with different translators also contains this phrase. For comparison, the thirteenth French edition, of 1850; the final paragraph says "des fondements nouveaux" - which in literal translation is "new foundations".
