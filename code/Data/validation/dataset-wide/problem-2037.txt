This is a variation on the "What's your greatest weakness?" question as the idea here is to identify what aspect within the company will be the hardest part to handle. Another way to word this is, "What part of this job will be the most difficult for you?" Whatever you pick as the item isn't the key point as much as it is what kind of follow-up do you give to it. For example, if writing documentation was a great challenge then one may answer that, "Going back to document what was done and why it was done is often a challenge as there are usually other top priority tasks to get done yet I do try to set aside some of my time to ensure that things are written down in a wiki or something that is accessible to everyone on the team," so that while the documentation is the challenge, there are things being done about it. Some people may pick that they are very diligent about doing good work and may have issues with perfectionistic tendencies. 

If you've done such a great job in improving your current team, there may be a perception of how great is the value you'd bring to the new team by doing the same thing over there. While you may still see improvements for your existing team, which would yield a much greater value: Taking the already pretty good team to its next level or taking the poor team up to the pretty good that you have with your current team? Consider on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of their potential where is each team. Your current team may well be at the 80 or higher mark while the other team may be down in the single digits and thus your challenge is to see if you can work the same magic with the new team. This could also be seen as the question of how well do you prepare successors for yourself so that you can continue to climb the corporate ladder for another possible motive here. 

What are the main principles about this work place? This is a question worth asking of various people and seeing what is the culture of the place. Is it a place where authorization is required in triplicate to do anything or do people just do whatever seems right without getting approvals all the time? Ask for what is to be done and what limits are there on the work. The key here is to get an idea of what changes are you making as well as at a high level understand some aspects of the big picture that will become more clear as you get things done and get used to how things flow in that company. Be prepared to ask for feedback regularly so that you can get an idea of how well are you doing or not doing in your role. 

When you first started this job, were all the tasks menial? Something else to consider is what you call menial may not be menial to someone else as there is something to be said for what proficiency have you developed in this job? Are you closing sales? What is involved in managing things so that the owner can focus more on other businesses? These are where I'd go as there is something to be said for working well on your own as that does appear to be the case here no? While right now things are in one state, look back over all of what you've done rather than just in the past week or month. 

I don't see the advantage of doing it that way. I could see logic in mentioning books that have impacted you in a cover letter so that you show what you've gained from these books so there is a point. Consider this question, "Why does it matter that you've read this book?" from the perspective of the interviewer. A couple of other points to ponder: 

First, there is the question of how are your off days handled. As an individual contributor, are there not some parts of the business where someone may say, "Oh, Monica handles that," which then means that a decision has to be made. Does this wait for you to be back in the office or does someone jump into your work to now do this as well? Some places I've worked had some things that while they would normally be handled by one person, if that person was out then it caused issues with getting some things done. In small companies there may be only 1 network administrator or one person that handles ordering the office supplies. For managers of projects or people this could be a bit more complex but the idea is the same. If someone has to deal with your stuff while you are out, how do you see this being handled? Second, there is how your fellow teammates are to see this part of how things work for you that is different than what others have. You'd be missing a day of what happens in the office that could be an issue at times. "Remember that time when Bob did that dance?" that happened on a day where you were out could be an issue if most of the staff are in Monday-Friday and you are only in Monday-Thursday. This is where your co-workers could see you as being there some of the time but not all the time. 

I currently work in Canada but have worked in the US previously. In both places, a 2 weeks notice is common as a way to tie up loose ends relatively quickly. For some higher up positions like a director the notice period may be higher assuming the departure is somewhat amicable and hand off of current work could take some time. Contracts can vary from as little as a couple of weeks to as long as about a year where in Canada there will often be a break before continuing on as there is a risk of the contractor being classified as an employee by the government. Some people may have contract renewals as in one place I worked for a few years, the contractor was there before I started and still there when I left though he did take a month break each year as part of his process. Projects are generally structured so that there can be the re-allocation of resources and sometimes the breaks come where a contractor take a bit of a break before coming back to the project after what would seem like a long vacation for an employee. Documentation can vary though most places I know will do minimal documentation as there isn't much value seen in that though I did have a place where I did a fair bit on documentation though I did have the challenge that my visa was expiring and I would be leaving the company for that reason. 

The point is to show what kind of communication skills and assumptions you'd make. You'd be given a task like reversing a string or FizzBuzz that while it may seem simple at first glance often has hidden stuff to find and explain as the whole point isn't to solve the problem but rather show how you find that answer. An analogy I like to use is to consider being given the identical word problem in grades 2 and 7. In grade 2, it is good enough to just get the right number at the end. In grade 7, it is more important to show why that number is right rather than finding that value which is the same idea here in terms of how do you approach solving a simple problem, what kind of tests do you do, what kind of complexity considerations do you make, etc. 

Yes, it would be typical for companies to ask for references. There is something to be said for if you had any part-time jobs during your schooling that those could be references to use as the key is demonstrating that you can be professional and responsible in showing up and getting work done. I remember being in a co-op program in university where I collected reference letters from high school teachers I had just to be prepared. 

Blaming the former workplace - If you talk down about where you worked before, then the people interviewing you may fear being in a similar situation in the future. Follow-ups to these responses - As you give these answers, there may be questions from the interviewer of, "What did you do about these concerns?" that may not be a question you're prepared to answer in a positive light. Putting yourself in a less than great light - This would be bethlakshmi's response where if you answer in less than positive terms, it may not go over well. 

There can be the appearance of an ultimatum here, "I want more money," said in a way that implies, "Or else...." with all kinds of different visuals one could use those Milton from Office Space's threat would be a favorite of mine in terms of humorous notes here. Money canâ€™t buy you performance would be a bit of a counter argument for more money not always getting better performance which is generally the implied trade. There are some people that may pursue this further where a TED Talk about the Marshmallow Challenge provides further evidence of how higher pay can backfire in some cases. Doesn't the "That's obviously childish" response give one answer for the negative connotation? In many mid to large-size companies, there are policies around changing salaries and thus giving someone a raise outside of these times is highly discouraged. This is coming from the HR/Finance departments that would say, "No, we don't usually just give spontaneous raises here." 

You could suggest doing a Skype interview though for a final round interview though this presumes the distance is rather non-trivial, e.g. moving from California to Texas, as there are some out of state moves that I wouldn't see as being that onerous, e.g. if I lived near Detroit and had to go to a Toledo suburb. The big issue here is how desperate is the company. As an example, if Amazon.com comes to Calgary, Alberta to recruit for US positions, then they are paying the cost but are having a hard time finding quality candidates. In contrast, Microsoft may not come up to Calgary for an interview and would rather prefer local candidates. 

Technical questions as in the "What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?" aren't likely. However, there may be questions where you may be asked to refer to technical experiences listed on your resume. "Tell me about a time when you used C++ at Acme Company." may well be a reasonable question that could be seen as technical in a sense. If you do ask for the orientation of the interview be prepared for some possible drilling as the initial answer may be that it is a behavioral interview and thus you may have to ask further questions to determine how down in the details will it get. I'd probably just be prepared to go over my experience and have stories prepared to explain things in my resume as well as the standard HR questions like, "Tell me about a time where you were stressed at work," or "What are your strengths and weaknesses?" type of stuff. While it may be appropriate, consider what kind of impression you want to give here as this may be something used in determining your fit for the role and asking a bunch of questions may backfire here. I'm not sure how likely that is though something to consider is how many other people are being interviewed for this position and your performance would be compared to them. 

How often do you ask your manager about what are your top tasks? How well do you communicate what are the deadlines for things to be done, ready to show, etc.? Those would be where I'd start as while you may want to say, "I wasn't told to do it," that could seem like a childish defence. 

How many people used those meaningful programs? How well could you have a reference such as a professor discuss your ability to create such programs? I'd probably leave off the "No employment history" on the resume though I would mention this in a cover letter from the perspective that, "I'm eager to learn about developing software in a commercial environment," or something similar to show where you want to go. I'd probably suggest having a portfolio of your code that you bring to interviews rather than attaching it to the resume as there is the question of how well could someone that doesn't know the code easily see what it does, which patterns were used, what kinds of trade-offs did you decide in architecting the code the way you did. While you graduated in 2012, what have you done for the last couple of years? This is somewhat important as well as whether or not there was relevant course work in getting your degree that may be useful to put on the resume. A curriculum vitae is the same as a resume in an employment context. 

This is where having various coping strategies would be important as well as knowing what to do in case of things escalating. I do have some chronic conditions where I have to have more than few tactics to manage them as well as letting my co-workers know in some cases as it may affect them to some degree. 

In addition, you may want to consider reading books on "Emotional Intelligence" that may provide clues on how to understand people as it may be that you have different expectations from others that has to be resolved here.
