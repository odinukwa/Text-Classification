I have server under RHEL 6.3 installed on that server Oracle 11gr2 and 12c, I want to create user lets say Ahmad but I want this user to be on both servers, for single server I edit to be like the following: 11g: 

Useful URLs: $URL$ $URL$ (this can be used as an exmaple) What are the differences between NoSQL and a traditional RDBMS? 

I have solution to some of your problems Q) Why does this happen? A) because invalid or missing values in data-change statements such as INSERT or UPDATE, ...etc Note disabling one of the main causes of this violation. Q) Preventing or workaround There is some restriction you can add to your database, I'm not sure if this practical (DBA should be able to decide) 

the error messages you got because you don't have privileges to log in to the server so you need to grant the user the necessary access. some tips to solve this issue: 1) Mount the remote disk locally (map network drive). 2) Use rman CATALOG command to make the backups available. 3) user has enough privileges on ORACLE level 

4) check the master status to get the log id ** after finish configuration the server one M1 you need to move to server 2 M2 (the same thing you did for server one but you need to make sure to change the host names as needed): 5) edit the cnf file but make sure the server id it not the same as M1 

for the query monitoring you have two solutions from MySQL level: solution 1: create log file for the query by editing or 

Make sure the MySQL server owner is MySQL:MySQL using and the permission level is 755 for everything except 644. then execute the following commands after changing the information inside to the correct one. 

port (3308) is located under 3.3.3.3 if I use the following command I will get the following result: 

Now lets move to , inside this file you need to search for your database section (in your question orcl) replace it like the following (note you need to take a backup from this file before doing any changes): 

The error above happened when you try to do something that take time higher than the original timeout. you can try option to increase the timeout for the command. example: 

you need to make sure the ownership and privileges are correct for the directory, you can use the following commands to set it right: 

I strongly recommend not to enable "Auto shrink" feature. since it will cause the following harm: 1) take a lot of resources on file system will level start fragmentation and other tasks. as well as high CPU usage and I/O since since it will start pagination. 2) its not controllable. 3) it may harm your database index. 

Now restart your listener by executing and then try to connect to the database by using the following commands 

My question is it possible to marge those parameters together without making a conflict, if yes please advise 

allows for statements to be parameterized, Therefore Itâ€™s more secure than EXEC in terms of SQL injection can leverage cached query plans, The TSQL string is built only one time, after that every time same query is called with , SQL Server retrieves the query plan from cache and reuses it. Temp tables created in EXEC can not use temp table caching mechanism. 

I am trying to configure MySQL cluster under three Windows 7 machines with disabled firewall, cluster information is like the following: 

If you get the result 0 thats mean the temp doesn't have enough free space, otherwise you need to check segment (mostly happened for RAC) by executing the following command: 

I found answer to my question, the following script will list all MDF and LDF is not attached to the instance on all the server (Note: I do NOT claim ownership of this script, had to do small modification since its a very old script) 

Since you have the following error message that mean either is not correct and/or the domain you are using. How to know if everything is working fine or not? You need to execute command, lets say the output is , and execute lets say the domain name , then you need to edit like the following 

Choosing character set usually based on the environment, each set has pros and cons. for example if your system has mixed character I strongly recommend but even utf8 has many types. for example: is faster than but less accurate for sorting. and if you want to use specific language Czech for example then you need to make the character set to get full language function. I found the following URLs regarding encoding hope they will help: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ the following URL contains some examples about disk usage for character set: $URL$ 

The problem with command, you changed the user to posgress but bash (to be more specific environment) owner still root or the original user, in-order to fix this issue use instead of 

Note MySQL 32 bit has limitation, you can not increase the memory to more than 1.8 to 2G. If MySQl version is 64 bit then you will have the following results 

you can also use the following script $URL$ to check foreign key problems and fix them. Regarding rebuild / optimize table this may cause problem, it happened to me once on SQL server. not sure about MySQL. my bad since the answer is not organized enough, I will try to re-organize it soon. 

My question here can I make a rule for the three user when they created a database should start with their name ( if user3 create a database the database will have as prefix) or to add it automatically. 

I have oracle 11G R2 under 6.3 test is the name of the database, the database contain 12 custom schema, sch1,sch2,...,sch12. is it possible to create database backup using method that contain all of the schema with no data except the first three one, the data is needed. 

You can have an auto-Incrementing column, as long as there is an index (key) on it, to fix this issue you need to execute those commands: 

Management Node: is the Node that process reading the cluster configuration file and distributes this information to all nodes in the cluster that request it. It also maintains a log of cluster activities. Management clients can connect to the management server and check the cluster's status. Data Node: This type of node stores cluster data. There are as many data nodes as there are replicas, times the number of fragments. For example, with two replicas, each having two fragments, you need four data nodes. One replica is sufficient for data storage, but provides no redundancy; therefore, it is recommended to have 2 (or more) replicas to provide redundancy, and thus high availability. Node: This is a node that accesses the cluster data. In the case of MySQL Cluster, an node is a traditional MySQL server that uses the storage engine. An node is a process started with the and options, which are explained elsewhere in this chapter, possibly with additional MySQL server options as well. Note: Node is the specialized type of API node. Please refer to MySQL webpage for more info: $URL$ 

First of all lets check what both commands mean: : Executes a Transact-SQL statement or batch that can be reused many times, or one that has been built dynamically. The Transact-SQL statement or batch can contain embedded parameters. : Executes a command string or character string within a Transact-SQL batch, or one of the following modules: system stored procedure, user-defined stored procedure, CLR (common language runtime) stored procedure, scalar-valued user-defined function, or extended stored procedure. The EXECUTE statement can be used to send pass-through commands to linked servers. some of the main deferences: 

database connection parameters such as: dedicated server, please checked processes parameter or query from ; checked max_utilization must less than or shared server, verify or check dispatcher were enough for all connection. 

Explanation: This error occurs when there are not enough system locks to complete the current command. SQL Server then attempts to obtain a LOCK block to represent and control the desired lock. When dynamically configured, the lock limit is determined by the available memory. When statically configured, the lock limit is determined by the setting. Action: you have two options earthier wait for sometime and re-execute the same command(s), or reconfigure locks value by executing the following commands 

Make sure there is no error message and listener is up and running by execute the following command: 

when I ran dbca as administrator under windows server 2008R2 is used to delete the database completely ( database folder, control files, , redo logs, then remove all related windows services to the database), but recently I noticed when I use it I found the services still exist as well as the trace (still generated), mail folder inside oradata still exist, as well as I can try to remove it countless time. DB trace: 

Edit to answer the comment below To shutdown MySQL safely without killing the SID (or PID) you can use one of the following commands: 

there are two common solution for : the first one you need to make sure path for is correct you can check it from the workbench by going to and the second one the environment variable is not correctly configured on the server. 

Lets define the in oracle: it is a small binary file that records the physical structure of the database and its include: 1) The database name. 2) Names and locations of associated datafiles and redo log files. 3) The timestamp of the database creation 4) The current log sequence number 5) Checkpoint information 

To drop it you need to make sure the user has owner privileges on the database, you can use the command 

since the the following command executed too fast when you try this locally (on the same server), and take a log time when you executed remotely, there is some common causes for that like the connection between the server and client is slow, or there is a delay (lag) on attempting to retrieve and verify reverse , you can try to add the following parameter for testing to or under section. 

you need to make sure there is: 1) user created that has remote access for example user@'x.x.x.x' 2) there is a connection from the two machine ( they can ping each other for example or access each another by another method) the port is opened between the two machine 3) in there is blocking connection parameter like: or 4) the service is up and running when you try to connect from the other machine 

I would go for option increase RAID desks since\if you are using one instance. since RIAD size id dynamic, can be increased any time you want, and you don't have to do any splitting. your options are" 

there is several methods to find the queries that cause high CPU usage, most common waies: Method 1: use build in SQL server report to find queries with high CPU time. 

This will show you the needed info, and you can check Activity Monitor too some useful links: $URL$ $URL$ 

Since the OS you are using is 64 bit, you need to make sure MySQL version you are using is 64 bit not 32 bit, how to get those information:
