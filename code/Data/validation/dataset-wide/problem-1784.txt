For KDE you can put a symbolic link to an executable in the directory home/username/.kde/autostart For GNOME just go to 

You should check out this link: $URL$ it provides a matrix of what is supported in each version. Standard has many more advanced features than Web such as the edit and design tools as well as not being able to duplicate data between more than one database, though there are some free options you can use to make up for what Web lacks. 

Open and into the location where the file is at Type which will show you the hidden files and the 8.3 filenames which usually look like: Since it is a folder you want to delete, run 

Dis[lays the drives assigned to the storage controller and the current KeyID used on the Storage System. Write down the encryption KeyID to be used for the next command. 

Filter for outgoing communication from server to internet is also important. Especially SMTP is recommended to allow only for one server. I manage Mikrotik firewalls, and I'm used to do for example: 

I have a USB device and I need to execute a "infinite" script when I plug in this device and pass the /dev/... path as an argument. The real example is: The device is RFID reader (0403:6001), which works as tty device. I need to run a script, which reads data from /dev/ttyUSBx and via xdotool prints them into opened web browser. As there could be potentially more devices evaluated as /dev/ttyUSBx, I need to pass the correct one to the script. The classic way seems to be by udev rule, but I read [1], that the "RUN" parameter is not for long time running scripts. Other than that, I cannot find env variable or %variable that would contain the "ttyUSBx". Another way I found is by systemd, but the classification of device looks like /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.2 which depends on the USB port... I am running Debian 8 Jessie.

Check to make sure your settings on the "isolated" server resemble those on the server you are using to download the updates as I believe those settings are captured in the metadata file. These can include settings on assigning computers to groups, products and classifications, etc. 

Windows 2008 has SSLv2 and SSLv3 enabled by default. To disable SSLv2 on Windows 2008 you may do the following: Create a key named under: Create a value and name it ensure the value data is Keep in mind that this setting only affects services and .exe's that actually use SCHANNEL.dll for SSL 

So my question then is still the and what the true meaning of when dealing with NTLMv2? My thinking is session security are the keywords here. Our 2008 server is set to level 5 Our 2000 server is set to level 1 The 2000 server cannot under any circumstances be changed from level 1 as unfortunately it would break authentication to many legacy devices. So to me it sounds like the issue is at level 3 where the session is passing NTLM. 

And upgrade finally ends up correctly. This was on Debian, I'm not sure how it will be on CentOS. It drived me nuts, at least I had Zimbra in virtual machine, so snapshot-and-restore was very helpful. This is very good source of informations: $URL$ 

I would definetely recommend outdoor Ubiquity product - cheap, waterproof and stable. And with PoE, so you don't have to solve power line, just ethernet cable. If you can place it on the top of the building, there shouldn't be problem with full coverage. Omnidirectional antena around 12dBi should do the work. Look at this: $URL$ 

You can connect number of cell phones via data cable to computer and send SMS or even make a call. For example good ol' Siemens C35 is perfectly suited for that. 

Nagios installation is stored outside of /var deeply in /usr, so you don't have to worry about mixing Nagios files with your own. 

There is a website located on this blog that was developed to test WinHTTP. The link directly to the site is here. 

ewwhite, You may have already come across this article but I had it bookmarked awhile back: $URL$ Hopefully this helps 

Verify the replacement drive has the same KeyID as the other SEDs and that it is Locked. Note: The drive has to be Locked to enable storage encryption on the drive. 

There are two options for this to work you will need to bind both apache and nginx to their own IP address. So for instance in the httpd.conf file you will need to list a specific IP such as The article listed below explains how to bind both nginx and apache as well as explains using nginx behind apache by setting up virtual hosts For more information check this site out 

No need of setting proxy in RouterOS. You can route all outgoing HTTP traffic to the server directly thru NAT: 

Cpanel is designed to mantain different users(customers) with their own virtual hosts, databases and FTP accounts. Therefor it creates system users and document root is in /home/, which is natural. Apache has default document root in /var/www, and if you don't have any special urges, you can let it there. Then you can make subdirectories for every virtual host, like this: 

The last parameter "src-address=!..." is needed in case which squid machine communicates thru same interface as the other machines. Otherwise it would go like this: 

Display stream on web Displaying the stream on web, which will work in most cases, is via flash player. I tried two products, which are free for non-commercial usage: JW Player and Flowplayer. I stayed with Flowplayer, but I don't remember the reason, maybe because of plugins (which I don't use:) ) or because of better documentation. How to display FLV stream from VLC in web page is covered here: Stream VLC to Website with asf and Flash Troubleshooting Be aware of many problems that WILL arise. First thing, as in everything, read. VLC is very chatty program, so it will tell you where the problem is. Could be problem with permissions to access the video/audio device, missing codecs, misspelled --sout parameters,... Learn to use to see if the data really flows thru network, etc. 

For security reasons, we need to "lock" some of the preferences in Mozilla Firefox. We are running Windows XP and the latest version of Mozilla version 14.0.1. In particular some of the security preferences such as . If the user were to do , we would like the particular options to be greyed out so they cannot click on them. I have read that this can be done by adding the following in: 

We know this password to be correct, but since these two domains (Win2000 & Win2008) do not have a trust setup what authentication account needs to be used? One that resides on the Win2000 hosted domain? 

APC is by far the best option out of the three. eAccelerator is beginning to lose its foundation and seems to have issues with the latest version of PHP. APC can be found here. There are a lot of other links out there but this is a reputable one (assuming that's the latest version). The main settings to define in your file will be: 

One way is to configure VirtualHost for prod.webapp.com and VirtualHost for prod.site1.com. And in the prod.site1.com configuration do reverse proxy to prod.webapp.com. Useful howto is here: $URL$ 

This magic command will 'bind' your laptop port 8081, to server port 8081. That means when you connect on server to 8081, you will silently connect to your laptop port 8081 via SSH tunnel. Cool, huh?:) So all we have to do is simple VLC connect and stream: 

I'm not familiar with MS Exchange, but for me it would be more natural connect to server via IMAP and walk thru inbox directly. Because I don't think that running developed application on the same email server is good idea (which is mandatory for accessing files). And sharing folder with text emails to be accessible from network? Not a good idea either.. Regards, Martin. 

That means, that no swap partition is available. If you have some unused space on hard drive, you can make it a swap partition (via fdisk). Or you can make swap on file. This creates 2GB swap: 

Also check your resolver file as well and delete the ssl directory in both areas then restart the sync process. Obviously you know the puppetca --list command to check to see if a certificate needs to be signed. You may also try to turn off your firewall and see if that allows the connection. Check out the /etc/hosts to make sure its all there. 

I am not sure if its the default option but you could check to see if oplocking is enabled. More information can be found here 

One thing that may help is to go into the registry at this location (assuming your speaking about MMC): 

From here you can see the Name and Description of each snap in. You then can verify against another computer or your own knowledge of what you expect to see. 

Try typing in the start menu search bar, does anything come up? This should be the users startup folder. Otherwise there is a great article located here on how to recover your "Startup" 

Sudo is aditional package, which has to be installed during Cygwin installation. Have you tried to become superuser? Anyway, you can always view content of the Cygwin files from Windows... 

Try to access the samba server with ip address instead: \_ip_address_of_samba_server_\upload Also check samba logs in /var/log/samba/log.smbd and see, if the windows client really tries to log in. Otherwise, there is problem with network. And the error seems like it.. Best regards, Martin 

As you can see, only two processes communicate via HTTP with some servers - iceweasel and spotify. The last column is [process_number]/[process_name]. With this, you can query and get the actual process: 

Laptop is connected with public IP address OR you can NAT port to laptop. This scenario is much easier, since you can connect from server to laptop nice and easy. Big disadvantage is, that you're bound to one location (one IP address). Laptop is not connected with public I address. This is little bit tricky, but will work from any network which will allow you to SSH to your server and have sufficiant upload (1 Mbps should do it). 

is suppose to resolve all dependencies and download the packages also resolves dependencies and downloads them My guess is that repotrack is downloading all the dependencies for any architecture since it doesn't appear you specified the architecture which could account for the difference in what you see downloaded. I believe you use the switch to specify your architecture 

We have run into an issue with one of our machines which keeps the GPO settings after removal from the Domain. We must connect this machine to the domain to receive updates from our WSUS Server. After running the updates, we remove the machine from the domain and reboot. However, the GPO settings are sticking after removal which prevents the machine from functioning properly. This machine is located in a closed environment. Any ideas how to rid this machine of GPOs? Running Windows 2008 R2
