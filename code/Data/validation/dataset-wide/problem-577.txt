I'd explore the options of smaller chainrings and larger cassettes. You should be able to find a 10-speed cassette with an 11 or 12 tooth small gear going right up to 32 or 34 or even larger big cog. On the front you could drop the chainrings from 52/39/30 to 48/36/26 which is more of a MTB triple. I have this on my roadbike, with a 12-28 cassette (the biggest that will fit) and gives me a granny gear ratio below 1, at 24.8 gear inches. 

To ride in the dark is difficult. You should have a decent head light on your helmet so it tracks your vision, and a handlebar light that tracks where your front wheel is aiming. In addition you should have a secondary front light and two back lights for redundancy. We don't make product recommendations here, but that would be the minimum. To increase your awareness, consider riding UP the track that you plan on coming down later. This way you'll be moving much slower and have a better chance of spotting obstructions before you come through. Also consider not doing crazy speeds on downhills. The road rules say "Don't outdrive your lights" so you should be able to stop in the distance illuminated. Perhaps you should leave the downhill leg until the sun is higher ? Braking technique - if you were doing a hard brake on a turn, and your front wheel slid out from under you then its all over, you're going down. Some more tread on your front tyre may have helped, as would lower pressure in the front tube. Another technique, you could overweight the front wheel to make the side lugs dig in and regain grip, or you could unweight the front wheel and try to stop it pushing, and therefore regain grip. All this has to happen really quickly, we don't generally react fast enough. Clothes - your outerwear did its job, and took all/most of the sliding damage. I suggest you slap some patches on the damaged bits, and on the knees, and call it your Riding Gear. No point dressing up all pretty for a ride (unless you're into that sort of thing) My favourite riding pants have canvas on the knees, over a patch of woollen blanket, and some light cotton on the inside of the knee, They're butt-ugly but totally comfortable. Finally experience - you've just acquired some. Sadly it was painful. You should also give your bike a close look and service. Standard crash damage to look for includes: 

Wet weather gear - You mention Halfords so its likely you're in the UK, which seems to be enjoying a riding renaissance. But the weather's going to be wet someday. You'll need a coat that works for wet riding. Later you can add overtrousers or overshoes. Personally I ride in gumboots (wellingtons) in the wet. Helmet - Not mandatory in the UK, but still a very good idea. Lights - again if your job hours mean riding after dark, lights are probably mandatory for you. Spare clothes, towel, deodorant. Either carry them with you in a waterproof bag/rack, or store them at work for a change on arrival. Consider using your non-bike days to carry that bag to/from work for starters. Bike security. Its no good coming out of work and finding your bike's missing. Even though its a cheap BSO bike, a lock will help prevent it from vanishing. I've got access to a bike room at work - check with your MAMIL about where to park it safely. Water bottle and bottle cage on the bike. On a hot day you can go through a lot of water, so its easier to carry that on the bike and not on your person. Your bike should have a couple of screw holes on the downtube, and a cheap plastic bottle cage will bolt in there with M5 screws. Use grease. Any convenient sized bottle will do, but poptops work best if you drink on the go. Screw tops require you to stop for a sip. 

First rule of on-line bike ride tracking... every single one has secret-sauce that they use to tweak your ride data. Strava ignores height information and simply plots your path's point locations on top of a map and that's how high you were. This method is pretty flawed if your GPS has placed you 20 metres off the road and you're in a deep cutting or on the side of a mountain with a hundred metre vertical drop to that side. I don't know anything about the Cateye services. The only answer is to take their results with a big pinch of salt, and merely work on improving the difference between the rides. Don't compare rides between different providers. 

I had something like this on an old folding bike. The owner said that he had it installed by a gorilla using loctite threadlocker. So the fix was to use leverage, but to control it so the tool did not slip. We had the non-drive side off and removed the axle, and reinstalled the shell temporarily. There was some threadded rod through the BB, and we used a stack of big washers to spread the load. This held the BB tool (a park HCW-4). Then we used a pikey hammer to gently turn the cup. Sounds like you have the cranks off but neither side cup. So your best option is to rig up something using the BB itself as the shaft that holds the tool in place. Some washers, or a short buttpipe/bushing might be all it takes. 

I've done this by putting an 8 speed free-hub wheel with a 7 speed cassette into a bike that had a 5 speed freewheel wheel. The only issue is wheel fitting/removal - a bit of leverage to separate the dropouts and the wheel tucks in nicely. If you needed to do this on the road Murphy's Law may ambush you and make it fiddly. Mounting the wheel square is awkward - I use a clamp on the brake lever to close the rim brakes, one hand where the tyre passes the chainstay, and the other hand to close the quick-release. Functionally it works fine for me, I'm riding that bike in a 12 hour relay this weekend. 

Late answer, but I opened a Shimano IGH shifter to change the inner cable. So I had to use a piece of sewing cotton looped through some part of the indicator gauge so that it would mesh correctly while I lowered the top housing on the base. The details escape me now, but the gears and levers inside the unit were all super lightweight plastic , and using the cotton as a lanyard let me position a pin exactly in the receiver, then drop one end of the cotton and pull it out the other side. 

Sounds like the 10 degree ones risk the cable's mushroom falling out of the open clevis, rendering the brake inoperable. That would be bad. You should replace the levers with safer ones. 

Cornering at slow speeds is easy. Cornering fast, that's where it starts getting harder. You're getting pedal strike because your pedal is lower than the road surface, so consider not pedaling through the faster corners. Instead, put your outside pedal down and put your weight on that leg. IE, for a left turn you should be pressing on your right leg. At the same time, unweight your saddle a little, a lot, or completely. This does dual purpose of pressing the tyre's shoulder into the ground for more grip and less slide, and in your case keeps the pedal clear of the ground. From $URL$ 

Yes, you can upgrade your mountain bike. However its a slippery slope of knock-on upgrades that can cost more than a nice, lightly-used bike. For starters, you can't generally slap on a cassette or freewheel with more gears, because they're wider. So the first thing to do is measure the "Over-Locknut Dimension", or OLD. This is the horizontal distance between the locknuts on the hub, and is equal to the gap between the inside surfaces of the rear dropouts. This is measuring a rear hub that has no axle in the way. This is 130mm This is measuring the rear dropouts using a ruler. Lower tech but just as good. This one is 126mm If you have a steel bike frame, is slightly more options than an aluminium or carbon frame, because it can be cold-set (aka slightly widened at the rear dropouts) to fit a wider hub. Can't do that with aluminium or carbon frames, If you have a steel bike you can increase about one size, so 126mm to 130mm or 130mm to 135mm. Then you have to align the rear dropouts again, using alignment tools like these half-axles showing minor tweak required. 

Basically a good cyclist is a good road user. Learn to do all this and then crank on the power for speed. Otherwise you could be too busy focusing on power and aero, to be a good road user. 

It looks like a fairly standard mid-late 90s road bike. If owner is positive its only 15 years old then its potentially a BSO. Nothing there makes it a tourer specifically. The frame looks slightly chunky, but not thick like early aluminium bikes. I could be wrong - do the magnet test to see if the frame and/or fork is steel. The stem shifters say mid 90s, and the over-the-top brake cables would agree. Someone's added a parcel rack, perhaps for commuting in a dry place? Lack of mudguards/fenders suggest its not from a wet location. The last person to ride it was not a strong rider, its in the lowest low hillclimbing gear. Gumwall tyres are not common anymore - could they be original ? 

If the bike has been crashed or dropped, then that may be more evident, and help you look in the most likely damaged spots. 

This is possible. Firstly, it depends on your idea of "old" For some users thats any phone over five minutes is old, and for others old means a flip phone from the 90s. Assuming you have an android-based or ios-based phone that works and has a decent battery life then you're pretty much set. Both will run the Strava application, which looks something like this: 

I don't have a garmin personally, I use an android phone with ANT+ to talk with a HRM and a Cadence sensor. The phone has a data internet link when in-range, and also has wireless ethernet when I'm at home. I need a strava account, and a cellphone account, and a working internet connection at home. 

In addition, 1/8" chain doesn't flex sideways like 3/32" chain does, so while its unsuitable for derailleurs, its great for tandem timing chains, and for single-speeds. The lack of flex also contributes to its durability. 

In the middle is an axle of threadded rod. A bicycle has maybe 15mm of this poking out on either side, and it is supported on the dropouts of the fork or frame. If you replace this axle with a much longer one and only support it on one side, then you risk bending the axle just outside the locknut. By comparison a wheelchair axle (aka a stub axle) has a short shaft but its much meatier. In this image, #38 seems to be a collar or similar to spread the load. 

Is the cut always the same distance around the tube from the valve? If so then you have something wrong in your rim. Use the punctured tube to measure where the damage is coming from... that will give you at most two positions, one in front of the valve hole and one behind. I think you'll find a cause in this very small sector of the rim. BTW - had you patched your tubes rather than replacing them, the punctures might have been reduced by the extra thickness of the patch in that spot. And if they punctured again though the patch, then you'd know straight away something's wrong there. 

"700 x 38c - 28 " You have a "700c" sized road tyre, in width of 38mm and the rim is 28 mm wide. This tyre size is also known as 622-38 because it is 622 mm across. A freewheel and freehub are the two different parts that do the same job. Your bike might have either, but not both. This is how the cogs in the middle of the rear wheel attach to the wheel's hub. If you replace the rear wheel completely, you can reuse the tube and tyre. You will need new rim (28mm wide) and rimtape. New spokes, and a new hub. If the cassette and chain are unworn you can transfer them over. Your cassette is a "shimano branded CS-HG41 with 7 speeds" so its not the old-style freewheel 

* Grinder Cut a slot in the nut without touching the frame at all. If that doesn't make it loose, then use a cold chisel or a flat screwdriver or the nut splitter above to remove. And knowing dremel cutoff wheels, you may need more than one. Possibly try a 100mm or 125mm grinder, but they lack the finesse of a dremel-style tool. 

Time for some Pee You need to consider PACING yourself. Use something like strava to log your rides and see your improvements over time, because it never feels like you're getting faster at the time. I did a hill last weekend in 8 minutes that used to take me 15 minutes, 9 months ago. Didn't feel like it at the time. PEERS - riding alone is nice and quiet and relaxing, but there's nothing like riding with some fellow cyclists. Ones who are slightly better than you is good - they drag you up to their levels (mentally, and physically by draughting) PRACTICE - get out and do more climbs. There's really no substitute. PERFORM - This relates to pacing. When alone on a hill - I tend to sing along quietly to myself. The tempo of the song helps with the rhythm of the ride. You're doing the right power output when you can't sing all the words, but can mouth them or hum the tune while breathing. Yes - I know it sounds stupid, but it works for me. PERSEVERE - do the same climb once or twice a month. It gets shorter and quicker each repetition. PEDAL - sounds simple, but just keep pedalling. Don't coast even if there's a wee flat bit or downhill. You can ease off the pressure, but keep spinning at 60-90 RPM POSTURE / POSITION - the accepted wisdom is that sitting through the climb is most efficient. If you stand then its faster and harder, but you're less efficient and will tire quicker. This all goes out the window if there's a short section of steep grade (like going up the inside of a hairpin turn where the grade can exceed 30% for a couple metres) or any grade above 18%. In those two cases, your bike's front wheel will be trying to lift on each downstroke so you need to position your body weight off the saddle, and accept the lower efficiency till the grade drops a bit more. I've run out of words that start with P. Any further suggestions? POTION! synonym for DRINK! okay not a Pee word until after the body has processed it, but do drink a few mouthfuls before the climb starts. Snatch a swallow when you can on the way up too. Dehydration is a sneak, stealing away your power and your enjoyment of the ride. EDIT1: PERSEVERENCE (a pee word for endurance) Keeping your average speed up over a long run is better for the slow twitch muscles to develop. Going hard brings in the fast twitch muscles, which have low endurance and get tired quickly and generate lactic acid quicker. PIES (its better than "Plighter Pbike") Every kilo you drag up the climb has to be lifted there by your legs. Stop taking things that you don't need. No need to go overboard with weight reduction, but do consider the benefit of a lighter item over a heavier one. Daytime only ride? Leave all your lights at home (I take one of each anyway, but not my usual three.) Do you end your ride with food to spare? Take fewer things, or make an effort to eat them so they're doing you some good. Tools? What can you do without? (but I carry an 8" crescent by choice and have needed it once.) Your clothes - do you need all the weight? I wear cycling pants but I wear normal pants on top. mostly because I feel uncomfortable without a belt for back support. If you're on platform pedals, shoe weight can be quite noticeable too. I have some thin mesh shoes that cost $10 at the local cheap-shop and weigh very little. Even thin light short socks can help save reciprocating weight PARTY! Mix it up. Do a long endurance flat ride like a metric century if you can, with rest stops. Next day do climbs with intervals of 100% effort for 20 sec then back to endurance speed for a minute. Repeat till you get to the top. Just occasionally, ride for fun with family or friends or some random guy on a bike who is going your way at your speed. Then try some easy MTB or off-road tracks for a change. PHUN! Cycling is often seen as an end-goal in itself. However its a means to an end, of getting fitter and getting somewhere. If you're not enjoying the benefits, change your approach before despondency sets in. PHUCKEDUP! Do take a moment to check on your fellow cyclists too - My old bikes are a bit crap, and I have the odd breakdown. Its very rare that anyone checks on me, but I always slow and ask anyone on the side of the road whether there okay.
