I have a 6000px x 4800 px version of this image (reduced & rotated to 480x600 here) that I use for an image slide show. I would like to add the description of each image into the slide show software. On this system the file name is but I suspect I coined that title (it was a long time ago it was downloaded). The original image is 5,150,779 bytes in size. Searching on the smaller, rotated version of the image points to pages like Astronomy Printshop, but there is nothing closely related to NASA in the first pages of the search, and the pages listed did not have much detail (certainly no legend). It might possible to search on the clipped, individual images, but I was hoping to avoid having to do that 88 times.

To answer my own question: no, not that I can find. Here is an attempt to identify them by image search. Let me know if there is an image/legend match that seems wrong. I can upload a higher resolution (466x426 px) version of the image. The images were cropped from the original image when it was oriented so the the 'HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE' message read from the bottom to top of image, and I will try to identify them in the same order. As such, we do 1 column at a time from top to bottom, starting from the right most. The column is marked in red above/below. But first, here is the captioned video created from combining the captions with a video slideshow of the images! Column 1 

In addition to the capture mechanisms mentioned by Andy, you also need to take into account the stability of any orbit due to perturbations from tidal effects. E.g. in case of our Moon, there are no stable orbits possible. Every satellite put in orbit around the Moon had had to implement course corrections to prevent it from prematurely crashing into the Moon. This effect explains why you don't have a lot of dusts and rocks in orbit around the Moon due to the large number of impacts. What happens is that after an impact you do get a lot ejecta, a small fraction will then collide with each other so that they get in an orbit around the Moon. But on the long term the tidal effects of the Earth and the Sun causes perturbations until the orbit crosses the lunar surface. 

The ratio of oxygen isotopes of lunar rocks are almost identical to those of Earth. Lunar recession due to the tides which causes the Earth's rotation to slow down, means that just after the Earth formed, the Moon was very close to the Earth and the Earth was rotating very fast. This situation can be reached due to an oblique impact that transfers a lot of angular momentum to the Earth. The formation of the planets is known to have proceeded via small objects growing larger by colliding with each other, this means that the last stages of planet formation would have involved collisions between large objects. It is to be expected that around the time the Earth was taking shape, there could also be a proto-planet at the Lagrange point 60 degrees away from Earth in the same orbit. On the long term this is an unstable situation which ends with a collision that according to simulations is of the sort that typically leads to the formation of the Moon. The asymmetry in the geology between the far side and the near side of the Moon. (there are many more maria on the near side compared to the far side). If the Moon had indeed been very close to the Earth after it formed, then the near side would have stayed very hot due to the Earth's surface still being molten and the radiant heat affecting the near side of the Moon. An impact on the near side of the Moon would far more easily be able to penetrate the solid crust and cause magma to flow to the surface compared to the far side of the Moon. 

Eyepieces The highest useful magnification of the Celestron Travel Scope 70 is about 165x. However, you are unlikely to find that much magnification to be usable except under very ideal conditions ("good seeing" i.e. clear atmospheric conditions, dark skies with no light pollution, viewing on a night with a new moon, etc). Even then the image at the eyepiece is going to be dim at that magnification. Any telescope can in theory achieve an unlimited magnification. But in practice, its magnifying power is limited by the amount of light the telescope is taking in, which is to say, its aperture. The telescope is only collecting so much light. Every increase in magnification is zooming in on a smaller and smaller area, which means it is looking at a smaller and smaller fraction of the original amount of light. On your telescope, the aperture is 70mm. This is the main thing that dictates how bright of an object you can hope to see at the eyepiece. There is another stat that is important to figuring out what eyepieces are likely to show you, though, and that is the telescope's focal length. Your scope has a 400mm focal length. Total magnification is the focal length of the telescope divided by the focal length of the eyepiece. Your telescope came with two eyepieces: 400mm (telescope focal length) / 20mm (eyepiece focal length) = 20x magnification 400mm (telescope focal length) / 10mm (eyepiece focal length) = 40x magnification As you can see, the smaller the eyepiece focal length, the greater the final magnification. If you tried an 8mm eyepiece, you'd get a 50x magnification. To get a 65x magnification, you'd need somewhere around a 6.2mm eyepiece. (Interesting aside: Since the magnification also depends on the telescope's focal length, note that each eyepiece will have a different magnification depending on the telescope it is in.) Before you go buying any extra eyepieces, though, I'd strongly recommend you go see what you can see with the equipment you already have! You should certainly be able to see Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars. 

If you do opt to buy another eyepiece, one thing to pay attention to is eye relief. Eye relief is how far away from the eyepiece you can be to still see a decent image. Eyepieces with shorter eye relief are cheaper, but they are also harder to use. An eye relief around 6mm to 8mm is much more comfortable for me. As for me, I can never help myself: for every telescope I've owned, I always buy an eyepiece that pushes the limits of my telescope, just to see what it looks like. But from experience, I can tell you it is not a great view. Still, it can be fun to see what your equipment can do. But before you jump all the way to an eyepiece that gives you 130x magnification (or whatever), I'd say to shoot solidly for the middle range of your scope (in your case, maybe 60x - 80x). If you can afford it, buy a mid range eyepiece with decent eye relief and field of view (FOV). You'll be much happier with the view through this eyepiece than you will an eyepiece that maxes out the magnification. Filters Do yourself a favor and at least pick up a lunar filter. They filter a certain percentage of the light and allow the rest through without modifying the color. The moon is so bright, it will make your eyes water trying to look at it through even a modest telescope. Lunar filters make looking at the moon a much more enjoyable experience.

As pointed out here, the limit of naked eye visibility for people with extremely good night vision is about magnitude 8.5. Neptune at opposition is much brighter at magnitude 7.7, so it should be visible to people with good eyesight. Astronomer Brian Skiff, made an attempt about a decade ago, he failed to spot it. He said that it should be relatively easy to spot from the Southern Hemisphere as it is high in the sky viewed from there. But surely many other people with good eyesight who are capable of seeing faint stars of magnitude 8 or even dimmer who work at the Paranal observatory will have given this a try? 

A "one time only freak accident" is only going to be considered as a likely possibility when scientists gain a deep understanding how life actually arises and on the basis of that can rule out that life will typically arise on Earth like planets in habitable zones. We haven't arrived at that point yet. Scientists will not invoke "freak accidents" to explain something unless there is a lot of evidence that points to that; clearly such assumptions amount to making the assumption that there is no natural explanation, but that has to be justified by other evidence first. 

The core of the question has already been answered, but it's still interesting to illustrate just how difficult it is to make a naked eye observations of a the extremely bright nearby galaxy M81. The astronomer Brian Skiff gives an account of his successful naked eye observation of this galaxy here. Now, galaxies of a given brightness are more difficult to spot than stars of the same brightness, because of their extended nature. If the sky is sufficiently dark, then you can see stars as faint as magnitude 8, but you'll still struggle to spot M81 that has a brighness of magnitude 7. The magnitude 7 is an artificial figure obtained by adding up the light that comes from slightly different directions. Also, you only need very slight amount of light polution to make the sky backgound just a tiny bit grey to make the galaxy vanish from view, while the visibility of faint stars remains essentially unaffected. This is because the brighness as a function of the position in the sky in the case of a star has a very strong and narrow peak while in case fo a galaxy, due to its extended nature, doesn't show a big peak. The integrated brightness may be the same for both cases, but the amount of background light you need to make the galaxy invisible is obviously much less than what you need for the star.
