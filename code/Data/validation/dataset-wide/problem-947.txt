I'm not familiar with land-based methods, but for global measurements, one method is to use satellite altimetry (I'm more familiar with the geodesy side, but many of the same satellites are used). I think many of the current methods interpolate global or regional currents from a sparse network of buoys. As more radar satellites are launched, however, satellite measurements of sea surface currents will become more common. Global-scale satellite-based radar altimetry measures the average elevation of the ocean's surface over a few kilometers (the exact amount depends on the wavelength of the radar band being used). Over this distance, waves cancel out, so the measurement is accurate to within a few centimeters. (This is aided by using the motion of the satellite to enhance the image, referred to as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).) Surface currents in the ocean are directly related to the slope of the ocean's surface. (Again, at the scales we're working with, wind-formed waves cancel out.) Once you have an accurate snapshot of the elevation of the ocean, you can calculate the direction and magnitude of the surface currents. (Note that this is only the surface currents! Deep ocean currents are different matter altogether.) This is also how we coarsely map the ocean floor from space. (For example, Sandwell & Smith's extensive work: $URL$ The average elevation of the ocean's surface with respect to center of the Earth follows the geoid (by definition). Seamounts on the ocean floor cause a preturbation in the geoid above them. Water effectively "bunches up" around seamounts (or rather, the surface of gravitational equipotential "bunches up" above the seamount). By repeatedly measuring the oceans surface (over several years) we can remove the effect of surface currents and get an accurate picture of what the geoid looks like over the ocean. You can then use this to predict water depths over the oceans on a spatial scale of ~1 kilometer. In fact, to calculate surface currents, you need this information to begin with. The surface currents are calculated as deviations from this measurement of the geoid. 

Based on the dimensions you provided and the photograph, the density is likely between 5 and 9 g/cm3, assuming cylindrical volume with height between 2.8-3 inches and radius between 0.4-0.5 inches. Based on this density and the weak magnetic properties, you have an iron-rich rock. Most fossils are comprised of calcite or a mineral with a similar density of around 3 g/cm3, with the exception of cases where metallic minerals replace the original material. The location provided is useful. However, I could not find a Cressy River, and I assume you are referring to the Merced River. This area flanks mountains that are rich in gold placer deposits and associated minerals, including iron. It is most probable that you found a iron-bearing mineral associated with the igneous or metamorphic rocks in the mountains.

I was unaware of a 0.5 mm maximum rule with ooid size. The Sam Boggs Jr. book on Principals of Sedimentology and Stratagraphy indicates that ooids can grow up to 2 mm. Grains larger than this are pisoids. The size limitation may depend on how you define an ooid. To me, an ooid carbonate grain with a nucleus and concentric layers of calcite or aragonite. The size is likely a function of the availability of calcium and carbonate ions in the water (calcite or aragonite saturation). I think that microbial action also contributes to large grain size, but if microbes are involved, then you might call it an oncoid instead. The similarity of ooid size is a function of similarities in the environment of deposition. Microfacies of Carbonate Rocks by Erik Flugel is a great book that discusses these features in detail. 

Basically, we know they were likely pelagic creatures because we find their fossils at essentially all water depths. If they were benthic creatures, we'd expect their fossils to be limited to a set range of paleo water depths. It's unlikely that a single benthic (i.e. living on the seabed) marine organism could live in both shallow water and ultra-deep water. However, for pelagic (i.e. floating or free-swimming) creatures, we'd expect to find their fossils at a huge range of paleo water depths because they live in the water column and don't care where the bottom is. 

However, for making detailed hydrological models, geophysical methods (particularly ground penetrating radar (GPR)) get used quite a bit. In fact, there's a whole field called "hydrogeophysics" that deals with imaging in near-subsurface environments. These methods don't get applied for locating a single well. They get applied to build detailed 3D models to constrain things like contaminant transport. If you need to know how groundwater is flowing in 3D, then you need a more detailed image of the subsurface than you do to locate a single water well. GPR is the most commonly used method, but I've seen almost every sort of geophysical data used in some cases (basically where it's already been collected and is freely available). Basically, the bigger the budget, the more fancy tools can get thrown at the problem. :) 

Based on the Theis equation, increasing the transmissivity will increase the radius of influence and decrease the total drawdown. Drawdown is directly proportional to the pumping rate and inversely proportional to aquifer transmissivity and storativity. $$s = \frac{Q}{4T\pi}\int_u^\infty \frac{e^{-y}}y dy$$ and $$u = \frac{r^{2}s}{4Tt}$$ Where s is drawdown, r is radius from well, t is time, T is transmissivity, Q is pumping rate, and u is the well function. Applying this equation, you can produce plots like this: for these plots, I used Q = 500, S = 0.01, and t = 4 

Because of variations in temperature, depth of emplacement, thickness of the crust, heterogeneity in the mantle, and variations in the magma distillation process, each volcano has a unique geochemical signature. However, volcanoes in similar tectonic settings have similar geochemistry. Geochemistry of magma starts out as ultramafic when sourced from the mantle. However, the mantle is not entirely homogeneous, which is evident from the presence of hot spots and other thermal and gravitational variations. Ultramafic magma rising from the solid mantle can be generated by decompression (thinning of the crust) or by the introduction of a contaminant (water from subducting plates). Once the mantle melt reaches the base of the crust, it's geochemistry can change via three different processes: 

I'm not an ideal person to answer this, but that's never stopped me before, so here goes! :) I've helped several hydrologists with the geophysical side of things at various points, but I'm not in any form or fashion a hydrologist myself. My father did the government permitting for residential water wells and septic systems where I grew up, though, so I've seen a bit of things from both the academic side and the practical side. For locating the average residential water supply well, gephysical methods are basically never used. They're just too expensive compared to drilling the well. 

Good question! I'll lay out the prevalent idea, originally (I think) put forward by Sykes, 1978 and supported by a large body of subsequent work by many authors. There are other models, however. In the most general sense: Intra-plate faulting is due to old, pre-existing weaknesses that are reactivated due to the plate interiors being very close to critically stressed. In other words, they're weak points in the interior of the plate. However, we don't fully understand why some old fault zones get reactivated while others in the same orientation don't. (It probably has a lot to do with pore pressure and fluid movement at depth.) There's a lot we don't completely understand about intra-plate earthquakes. Also, please don't use the term "fault line". It offends my geologic sensibilities! :) (Faults are 2D surfaces, not lines, thus the nitpicky objection.) Most of the crust is close to being critically stressed (breaking) There's a lot of evidence that the continental crust everywhere is close to being critically stressed -- in other words, failing in an earthquake. (e.g. see the various Townend and Zoback papers.) The crust isn't just critically stressed near the plate boundaries, but also away from them. This may also be true for oceanic crust, but we don't have as much data there. Another way of saying this is that the plates are being pushed along as hard as they can without crumpling. Basically, this is why things like building a dam or deep fluid injection trigger small earthquakes. The crust is already close to failure, so adding load or increasing pore pressure often triggers small fractures. (However, these sort of things can't trigger a major earthquake unless they're on an already active fault. You need continuous slip along a very large surface for a large earthquake.) The plates being critically stressed is actually is what we'd expect. We see deformation at plate boundaries whenever they collide. Therefore, we know that the stresses driving the plates are greater than the "breaking" strength of the crust. Because stresses from a collision at the boundary will be transmitted to the interior, it intuitively makes sense that the interiors should be close to, but just below (otherwise they'd be deforming), the failure threshold. (For the complete argument, see Zoback and Townend, 2001) Continental crust is full of old zones of weakness The continents are very old. Much older than the oceanic crust. The continents are like rafts that keep bumping into each other. Therefore, they have lots of "scars" (i.e. old fault zones). There's a saying in structural geology: "once a weakness, always a weakness". Fault zones are typically much weaker than the crust around them. Once a fault breaks through, it tends to be a permanent weakness that will be reactivated even if it's not in a perfectly favorable orientation. Critically stressed crust + weak zones --> intra-plate earthquakes. But why don't we see activity on all old fault zones? Short answer, we don't really know. It probably has a lot to do with pore pressure and fluid movement. Some old fault zones have intra-plate earthquakes, while others don't, even if they're in the same orientation. Pore pressure plays a huge role in faulting (it make rocks much easier to break). There's a lot of speculation that active intra-plate fault zones may have more fluids at depth, though explaining why is difficult. 

Based on the brassy color, it's metallic luster, and it's resistance to breakage, I would say it's pyrite. Try to scratch glass with it (be careful not to break the glass). If it scratches, it is likely pyrite. If a nail can't scratch it, it is likely pyrite. You could test it's streak by rubbing it on a piece of hard unglazed ceramic. If it leaves a black mark (maybe with a hint of green), then it is likely pyrite. $URL$ Edit: Based on a approximate volume of 458 mL (that of the Monster), which is 458 cm3, and the density of pyrite of 5 gm/cm3, then sample should weigh about 2.3 kg (5 lbs). Galena (see wienein comment below), a less brassy and less hard (easier to scratch) metallic mineral, has a higher density of 7.6 gm/cm3, which would give is a mass of 3.5 kg (7.7 lbs), closer to what you are showing in the picture. Galena has a light grey streak and contains lead. 

I have seen several graphs showing the prehistoric temperatures and CO2 concentrations derived from ice-core data. My understanding is that CO2 and temperature correlate. I assume that Milankovich Cycles are what caused the variations observed in temperature in the ice record, but what specifically caused the CO2 to fluctuate? 

Bubble in an ancient lava flow What you're seeing is a vug in a vesicular basalt. A vug is simply a term for a mineral-lined cavity. In this case, the host rock is a basalt. You're seeing an ancient lava flow that trapped a bubble of gases escaping from the magma as it cooled. Over time, groundwater infiltrated the bubble. As the basalt was buried, changes in the pressure, temperature, and ion concentrations in the water caused different minerals to precipitate and even change into other minerals. Zeolites in Northwest Iceland Given the location (northwest iceland), the minerals are probably zeolites of various sorts. Anywhere else, you'd most likely be looking at quartz, clays, calcite, or amorphous silica filling the cavity. Northwest Iceland is known for zeolite mineralization within vugs in vesicular basalts. There are several world-class localities for zeolite minerals in the area. Northwest Iceland has some of the oldest basalts in Iceland (they're still very young geologically, however). They've been buried and then the material above them has been eroded away, bringing them to the surface. As we'll see shortly, that's a key piece of the picture. How did the Zeolites form? Initially a bubble of gases escaping from a lava was trapped as the lava cooled, forming a vesicular basalt. Next, groundwater seeped into the vesicle ("frozen" bubble). Then, the basalt flow was slowly buried by many other basalt flows. Chemical reactions occured as he temperature, pressure, and water chemistry changed due to burial. Initially, glass and olivine in the basalt near the vesicle would have broken down into smectite clays. Olivine crystalizes at high temperatures as the magma is cooling, and therefore, it's relatively unstable at low-temperature conditions. Glasses form after the lava has erupted and is cooling too rapidly for minerals to form (a glass doesn't have a crystal structure). They're often unstable because there's no regular atomic arrangement. Given time and right conditions, volcanic glasses will turn into minerals (in this specific case, mostly clays). As the clay-lined vug (a vesicule becomes a vug once minerals begin to fill it) was buried further, the clay minerals began to become unstable due to the changing conditions. When this happens, they transform into other minerals. This is called metamorphism. Zeolite metamorphism is one of the lowest grade (lowest temperature and pressure) types, so the temperatures and pressures involved didn't affect the minerals in the basalt, only the clay minerals in the vug. Depending on the types of clays and the pressure, temperature and water chemistry conditions, different zeolite minerals formed from the clay minerals that became unstable. In fact, you can actually constrain how deeply buried that particular piece of rock was from the minerals within the vug. Finally, the rock above was eroded away, and this particular section was brought back to the surface, where you found it. 

Crystal settling - various mineral have differing melting/solidifying temperatures, allowing for a process of distillation where magma can gradually be made more felsic (from basalt-like to rhyolite-like) Inclusion of country rock (aka assimilation) - where crustal material is incorporated and melted into the magma Partial melting - where only the part of the rock material is melted 

Crystal settling and partial melting follow the Bowen's reaction series (pictured), which tells you which minerals melt at which temperatures. This is essentially the same process of distillation of alcohol by separating it from water, which has a lower temperature of vaporization. Each of these processes allows for a unique rock chemistry, even within the same batholith. While we categorize magmas into different groups based on their geochemistry, we must keep in mind that the geochemistry of any igneous rock falls along a sliding (not discrete) scale (i.e. not every granite is the same). Otherwise igneous petrology would be really easy. See the wikipedia article on igneous differentiation for more information. 

Was the first crust entirely mafic (oceanic) crust which was later distilled via volcanic arcs along subduction zones to make felsic rocks or did the earth start with bits of felsic crust? Are the ancient zircons most likely from felsic or mafic rocks?
