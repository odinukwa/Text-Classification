It's true: there's an isometric embedding of every real tree $T$ on some $\ell^1$-space, i.e., a set $A$ and a map $f:T\to \ell^1(A)$ that is an isometric embedding, that is, satisfies $\|f(x)-f(x')\|=d(x,x')$ for all $x\in T$. I don't know a reference; here's a proof. Let $(x_t)_{t<\alpha}$ be an enumeration of points on the real tree $T$ by an ordinal $\alpha$, assume that the convex hull of them is $T$. Let $T_\beta$ be the closed convex hull of $\{x_t:t<\beta\}$ (so $T_\alpha=T$). Let us construct by induction an isometric embedding $f_\beta:T_\beta\to\ell^1(\beta)\subset\ell^1(\alpha)$, so that whenever $\beta\le\gamma$ then $f_\gamma$ extends $f_\beta$. For $\beta=1$, $T_\beta=\{x_0\}$, and we just prescribe $f_\beta(x_0)=0$. For $\beta=\gamma+1>1$ a successor ordinal, $T_\beta$ is the convex hull of $T_\gamma\cup\{x_\gamma\}$. Let $y_\gamma$ be the projection of $x_\gamma$ on $T_\gamma$. So $$T_\beta=T_\gamma\cup [y_\gamma,x_\gamma].$$ We define $f_\beta$ so as to extend $f_\gamma$ on $T_\gamma$, and prescribe $f_\beta(y)=f_\gamma(y_\gamma)+d(y,y_\gamma)e_\beta$ for every $y\in [y_\gamma,x_\gamma]$, where $(e_t)$ is the canonical basis of $\ell^1(\alpha)$ and $d$ is the distance in the tree. This is well-defined (note that $f_\gamma(y_\gamma)$ is defined twice) and defines an isometric embedding. Finally, for $\beta$ a limit ordinal, then $T_\beta$ is the closure of $T'_\beta=\bigcup_{\gamma<\beta}T_\gamma$, we just define $f_\beta$ on $T'_\beta$ by saying its graph is the union of graphs of all $f_\gamma$ for $\gamma<\beta$; this is an isometric embedding into a complete metric space, so extends uniquely to an isometric embedding of the closure $T_\beta$ into $\ell^1(\beta)$. So $f_\alpha$ is the required isometric embedding. 

The answer [edit: of the second question about weakly/almost malnormal in $G$] is "no" in both cases and you need to reformulate the question as I suggested in the comments. If $F$ is a nontrivial finite group, $U,V$ are nontrivial groups and $G$ is the amalgam of $A=U\times F$ and $B=V\times F$ over $H=F$, then $F$ being finite, it is obviously almost and weakly malnormal. However, if $u$ and $v$ are nontrivial elements of $U$ and $V$, then the centralizer of $uv$ contains $F$, so is not infinite cyclic, and is not conjugate inside $A\cup B$. 

Now I answer the question, which regards freeness of arbitrary cyclic groups (recall that, by definition, a family $(H_i)$ of subgroups of a group $G$ is free if the canonical homomorphism from the free product of the $H_i$ into $G$ is injective). Define $\gamma_i=(g_i,h_i)$; assume that no $\gamma_i$ equals 1 and that $I$ has at least 2 elements. For $g$ in a group, define $o(g)$ to be the order of $g$ (0 if $g$ is not torsion). 

I think question 2 has a positive answer when $G^{der}$ is simply connected [EDIT: and without anisotropic factor], but not in general. If $G=PGL_d$ (so $G=G^{der}$) then $G(K)/[G(K),G(K)]=M/M^d$ where $M=K^*$, this is not a trivial group in general. Relevant refences should be the preliminary chapters in book by Margulis "discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups", as well as Platonov-Rapinchuk's book. 

Yes, because $G$ is top. f.g. and its maximal subgroups have bounded index. Let me prove the latter fact. Let $K$ be the core (=intersection of conjugates) of $H$, so $K$ is an open normal pro-$p$-subgroup. Let $M$ be a maximal open subgroup in $G$. Then either $MK=M$ or $MK=G$. In the first case, $K\subset M$, which bounds the index of $M$. So now assume $MK=G$. Let $N$ be the core of $M$. Write $G'=G/N$ and also denote with primes the images of the various subgroups in $G'$; since $N\subset M$ we have $M'\neq G'$, so $M'$ is maximal in $G'$. Also $G'=M'K'$, so necessarily $K'$ is nontrivial. Let $A$ be the (nontrivial) center of the $p$-group $K'$; it is characteristic in the normal subgroup $K'$ and hence is normal in $G'$. Then $A\cap M'$ is normalized by both $M'$ and by $N'$, hence it is normal in $G'$. Since the core of $M'$ is trivial, we deduce that $A\cap M'=1$. By maximality of $M'$, we deduce that $G'=M'\ltimes A$. The centralizer of $A$ in $M'$ is normal in $G'$ and again since the core of $M'$ is trivial it has to be trivial. Thus $K'\cap M'=1$, and since $K'$ contains $A$ this forces $K'=A$. Thus $$|M'|=[G':K']\le [G:K] $$ Hence $M'$ has bounded cardinal. Since by maximality $M'$ acts irreducibly on $A$ (in the sense that $A\neq 0$ and $A$ has no nontrivial $M'$-invariant subgroup), $A$ is $p$-elementary, and has dimension $\le |M'|$, hence cardinal dividing $p^{[G:K]}$. Since the cardinal of $A$ equals the index of $M'$, we deduce that $[G:M]=[G':M']$ divides $p^{[G:K]}$, so is bounded. 

That's correct: every finite quotient is solvable. Indeed let $G$ be your product of finite solvable groups. Let $p:G\to F$ be a (possibly non-continuous) surjective homomorphism to a finite group $F$. Lift $F$ to a finite subset $\tilde{F}$, and let $H$ be the closed subgroup generated by $\tilde{F}$. Then by the Nikolov-Segal theorem, the restriction of $p$ to $H$ is continuous. But as a closed subgroup of $G$, $H$ is a projective limit of finite solvable groups. So all its quotients by open subgroups are finite solvable groups. More generally, this shows that 

I consider my job of mathematician not as intended to produce new mathematics, but to explore and spread mathematics. Then exploring mathematics consists in 

No. For a finitely generated group, the property "have no codimension 1 subgroup" is called Property FW. Property FW passes to finite index subgroups, so excludes virtual splittings. Actually for an infinitely generated group, the existence of a "codimension 1 subgroup", the transitive version of Property FW, is still discarded by virtual splittings, but there are maybe a few details to check. I'll assume in the absence of context that you're interested by finitely generated groups. Edit: here are missing references. That Property FW passes to finite index subgroups is Proposition 5.B.1 in this arxiv paper. The non-existence of a "codimension 1 subgroup" is called Property FW' (and equivalent to Property FW for finitely generated groups, but not in general). That is passes to finite index subgroups is obtained by a similar argument. The whole point is that when one induces an action of a finite index subgroup to the whole group (see §4.F in the above reference), this maps a transitive action to an action with finitely many orbits. I don't use CAT(0) cube complexes for this. 

Terminology (borrowed from here): if a group $\Gamma$ acts on a set $W$ (here, the plane), a subset $X\subset W$ is $\Gamma$-commensurated if $X\Delta\gamma X$ is finite for all $\gamma\in\Gamma$, and $\Gamma$-transfixed if there exists a $\Gamma$-invariant subset $X'$ such that $X'\Delta X$ is finite (clearly this implies that it is $\Gamma$-commensurated and furthermore that the cardinal of $X\Delta\gamma X$ is bounded independently of $\Gamma$). (The link with ends of coset spaces is that for a finitely generated group $\Gamma$ with subgroup $\Lambda$, the Schreier graph has $\ge 2$ ends if and only if $\Gamma/\Lambda$ has a non-$\Gamma$-transfixed $\Gamma$-commensurated subset. Here restricting to transitive actions would be inconvenient, so I'm using the above language.) 

Fact: ($k$ noetherian) the $k$-ACC condition passes to finite direct products. Proof: it's enough to do it for a product $A\times B$. Let $(H_n)$ be an ascending sequence of subalgebras of $A\times B$. The projections being stationary, we can suppose that the projections of $H_n$ on both $A$ and $B$ are surjective. It follows that the intersection $H_n\cap (A\times\{0\})$ is an ideal in $A$. Since $A$ is noetherian (as I first checked: this didn't use this finite product claim), this intersection is stationary and we're done. 

Here's an example with short exact sequences of (infinitely generated) abelian groups. Fix a prime $p$ and let $C=\mathbf{Z}[1/p]/\mathbf{Z}$ be the $p$-Prüfer quasi-cyclic group; let $C^{(n)}$ be an isomorphic copy of $C$, and let $C^{(n)}_k\simeq\mathbf{Z}/p^k\mathbf{Z}$ be the $p^k$-torsion in $C^{(n)}$. Consider $B=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbf{N}}C^{(n)}$. Let $\mathbf{N}^*$ denote the positive integers. Define subgroups $A=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbf{N}^*}C^{(n)}_{n}$ and $A_2=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbf{N}}C^{(2n)}_{n}$. Then clearly, $A$ is isomorphic to $A_2$, and $B/A$ and $B/A_2$ are isomorphic (to $B$). On the other hand, the exact sequences $A\hookrightarrow B\twoheadrightarrow B/A$ and $A_2\hookrightarrow B\twoheadrightarrow B/A_2$ are not isomorphic, because $A$ contains the $p$-torsion of $B$ while $A_2$ does not. 

There are plenty of ways of characterizing bounded rank for finite simple groups. Let $G$ be a finite group. Define 

Here's now the detailed proof. First observe that $L$ maps the trivial group 1 to itself (edit: alternatively, see the comment by Todd Trimble). Indeed we have a bijection (the previous one for $G=1$, $U=L1$) $\mathrm{Hom}(L1,L1)\to \mathrm{Hom}(1,L1)$; the latter is a singleton and the former contains the identity of $L1$ and the trivial endomorphism and hence is a singleton iff $L1=1$. It follows that $L$ maps the trivial (=constant) homomorphisms to themselves (because these are the one factoring through the trivial group). For any groups $G,H$ use the notation for the canonical injections and projections: $$ G\stackrel{i_G}\to G\times H\stackrel{i_H}\leftarrow H,\quad G\stackrel{p_G}\leftarrow G\times H\stackrel{p_H}\to H,$$ inducing homomorphisms $$ LG\stackrel{Li_G}\to L(G\times H)\stackrel{Li_H}\leftarrow LH,\quad LG\stackrel{Lp_G}\leftarrow L(G\times H)\stackrel{Lp_H}\to LH.$$ We have $$p_Gi_G=\mathrm{id}_G,\quad p_Gi_G=\mathrm{id}_G, \quad p_Gi_H=1, \quad p_Hi_G=1,$$ thus $$Lp_GLi_G=\mathrm{id}_{LG},\quad Lp_HLi_H=\mathrm{id}_{LH}, \quad Lp_GLi_H=1_{LH,LG}, \quad Lp_HLi_G=1_{LG,LH},$$ where $1_{A,B}$ is the trivial (constant) homomorphism from $A$ to $B$. From the first two equalities, we deduce that $Li_G$ and $Li_H$ are injective and we have semidirect decompositions $$L(G\times H)=Li_G(LG)\ltimes \mathrm{ker}(Lp_G)=Li_H(LH)\ltimes \mathrm{ker}(Lp_H)$$ (where the projection to the left-hand factor is given by $Li_GLp_G$, respectively $Li_HLp_H$); from the last two equalities we deduce that $Li_G(LG)\subset \mathrm{ker}(Lp_H)$ and $Li_H(L_H)\subset \mathrm{ker}(Lp_G)$. It follows that the map $$L(G\times H)\stackrel{Lp_G\times Lp_H}\to LG\times LH$$ is surjective: indeed the left-hand map being surjective in restriction to $Li_G(LG)$, it amounts to see that the right-hand map is surjective in restriction to the kernel of the left-hand map, and this kernel is $\mathrm{ker}(Lp_G)$ (by the first semidirect decomposition), and this kernel contains $Li_H(L_H)$, in restriction to which the right-hand map is surjective. This proves that $Lp_G\times Lp_H$ is surjective (I used very little of the hypotheses about $L$: only that it's an endofunctor mapping the trivial groups to themselves). Now we proceed to show that $Lp_G\times Lp_H$ is also injective. If $f:A\to B$ is a group homomorphism and $K$ another group, denote by $q_K[f]$ the resulting map $\mathrm{Hom}(B,K)\to\mathrm{Hom}(A,K)$ given by $g\mapsto g\circ f$. Consider the following maps: $$[*]\quad \mathrm{Hom}(LG\times LH,K)\stackrel{q_K[Lp_G\times Lp_H]}\to \mathrm{Hom}(L(G\times H),K)\stackrel{q_K[Li_G]\times q_K[Li_H]}\to \mathrm{Hom}(LG,K)\times\mathrm{Hom}(LH,K).$$ Let $s$ be the composite map. Let us show that $s$ is injective and describe its image. Since $q_K$ is a contravariant functor, the composite map $s$ is given by $$s=q_K[(Lp_G\times Lp_H)\circ Li_G]\times q_K[(Lp_G\times Lp_H)\circ Li_H]$$ $$=q_K[Lp_GLi_G\times Lp_HLi_G]\times q_K[Lp_GLi_H\times Lp_HLi_H]$$ $$=q_K[\mathrm{id}_{LG}\times 1_{LG,LH}]\times q_K[1_{LH,LG}\times \mathrm{id}_{LH}].$$ Explicitly, $\mathrm{Hom}(LG\times LH,K)$ is given (via the embedding $s$) by the set of pairs of homomorphisms $(u_G,u_H)\in\mathrm{Hom}(LG,K)\times\mathrm{Hom}(LH,K)$ whose images in $K$ centralize each other; here if $u\in \mathrm{Hom}(LG\times LH,K)$, $u_G$ is its restriction to $G$ and $u_H$ its restriction to $H$, and $u(x,y)=u_G(x)u_H(y)$ for all $(x,y)\in LG\times LH$. We see (from the above cumbersome but trivial computation) that $s(u)=(u_G,u_H)$. Now assume that $K=U$ belongs to $D$. Then the map $$\mathrm{Hom}(L(G\times H),U)\stackrel{q_K[Li_G]\times q_K[Li_H]}\to \mathrm{Hom}(LG,U)\times\mathrm{Hom}(LH,U)$$ is isomorphic (by the functorial property of $L$) to the map $$\mathrm{Hom}(G\times H,U)\stackrel{q_K[i_G]\times q_K[i_H]}\to \mathrm{Hom}(G,U)\times\mathrm{Hom}(H,U),$$ which itself is injective, for the same reason as the previous one (a homomorphism on a direct product is determined by its restriction to factors) and also, for the same reason its image consists of pairs of homomorphisms whose images centralize each other. So, writing symbolically [$*$] as $X\stackrel{v}\to Y\stackrel{w}\to Z$ we have shown that $w\circ v$ and $w$ are both injective with the same image (**edit: [$**$]). This implies that $v$ is bijective. Namely, for every $U$ in $D$, $$\mathrm{Hom}(LG\times LH,U)\stackrel{q_K[Lp_G\times Lp_H]}\to \mathrm{Hom}(L(G\times H),U)$$ is bijective. Apply this (the surjectivity) to $U=L(G\times H)$ and the identity of $U$, we obtain that there exists a homomorphism $g:LG\times LH\to L(G\times H)$ such that $g\circ (Lp_G\times Lp_H)=\mathrm{id}_{L(G\times H)}$. This shows that $Lp_G\times Lp_H$ is injective and concludes the proof. Edit: in [$**$] I have to justify that they have the same images. I was initially not careful about this: if $G\to LG$ is surjective for all $G$, then this is fine because the above description really provides the same description for pairs of homomorphisms extending to a homomorphism on the direct product. But if $G\to LG$ is not surjective, it's a priori not clear that if we have $G\times H\to U$, then the images of the factored maps $LG\to U$ and $LH\to U$ centralize each other. However this is true by the lemma below, and thus it's fine. Lemma If $G,U$ are groups with $U\in D$ and $f:G\to U$ induces $f':LG\to U$, then $C_U(\mathrm{Im}(f))=C_U(\mathrm{Im}(f'))$, where $C_U$ denotes the centralizer in $U$. In particular, if $g:H\to U$ is another such homomorphism and induces $g'$ and if the images of $f$ and $g$ centralize each other, then the images of $f'$ and $g'$ centralize each other. Proof: first note that $\mathrm{Im}(f)\subset\mathrm{Im}(f')$, so the inclusion $C_U(\mathrm{Im}(f))\supset C_U(\mathrm{Im}(f'))$ is clear. Now consider $t\in C_U(\mathrm{Im}(f))$. Then $h:y\mapsto tf'(y)t^{-1}$ is a homomorphism from $LG$ to $U$ and the composite map $G\to U$ equals $f$. By the universal property of $L$ (namely, the injectivity of $\mathrm{Hom}(LG,U)\to\mathrm{Hom}(G,U)$), it follows that $h=f'$. So $t$ centralizes the image $\mathrm{Im}(f')$. This proves the first statement. The second statement follows by applying the first statement twice: if $u$ belongs to the image of $f$, then it centralizes the image of $g$, hence centralizes the image of $g'$. Now if $u'$ belongs to the image of $g'$, then it centralizes the image of $f$, hence centralizes the image of $f'$.
