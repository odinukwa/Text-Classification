But they do. Labor Let's look at how labor increases wealth by looking at a couple of examples: Example 1. I work at a farm. The result of my work is some farm produce worth X. For that I am paid Y. The farmer that hired me will receive X-Y. The net wealth gain for the society is Y + (X-Y), or X. Example 2. I work as a barber. I charge X for a haircut. The customer gets a haircut worth X. Net wealth gain for the society is X + (X-X), or X. Since the haircut is consumed immediately, the amassed riches don't increase. Note that the customer didn't lose out - to him a haircut was worth at least X or he wouldn't have gotten one. In macroeconomic terms the GDP increases by X and net savings is unaffected. Trade Trade increases wealth by transferring a good or a service to someone that values it higher. Example 1: I buy a used car from a neighbour for X amount of money. I get a car that is worth Y to me (Y>=X, or I wouldn't have bought it). My neighbour gets X for a car that was worth Z to him (Z<=X, or he would have kept the car). The wealth produced is (Y-X) + (X-Z), or Y-Z, which is >= 0 because Z<=X<=Y. In GDP terms the wealth produced is X - X, or 0, because GDP only measures how much is paid. Example 2: An electronics company imports batteries from China for 10 cents each. They sell the batteries to customers for \$3 each. The wealth increase in GDP terms is \$2:90 per battery. The wealth produced is shared by the electronics company, the shipping company, the store salesman and any others that provide services to the electronics company. Innovation Innovation is both the invention of new and the improvement of the existing. Actually, most innovation is small improvements in existing technology or design. Example: I improve a machine that makes nails so that it can make twice the number of nails in the same time. This means that more nails can be produced (and thus consumed) using less labor. 

There's a very fine point that needs to be mentioned: The participation rate is the percentage of adult population of a country that is capable of work and wanting to work, individuals who are capable and wanting to work are the labor force. Now when unemployment is measured, it is typically the percentage of individuals in the labor force who actually have the kind of employment (in terms of time worked) that they desire. The importance of the participation rate is the following: when some individuals are unemployed for a long period of time, they eventually stop looking for work (the "willing to work" part is no longer valid) either because they've given up, or their skills are too outdated to be useful to the market. These individuals are dropped out of the labor force. Assuming all else is constant, these unemployed individuals leaving the labor force means there are less unemployed individuals as a percentage of the total labor force (lower unemployment rate), but now the participation rate is lower (smaller labor force divided by same total adult population). Therefore, unemployment numbers aren't really telling you the whole story if you assume that people dropping out of the labor force would actually want to work if they had found work, and thus unemployment rates alone may give a better picture of how workers are actually doing. In short: Unemployment rate = total employed/ labor force Participation rate = labor force/adult population As for the retired, I believe those are considered outside the labor force. Example: Assume a coal miner has no other job market skills than the ability to mine coal. Assume country X bans coal mining. All coal miners are left without a job but will not search for a job because they can't do any other job. The unemployment rate is unchanged, but the participation rate drops. Very generally: 

The main factor was bad loans. Moreover, bad loans were made to look like high grade loans by lying and by gaming the system. Housing loans were bundled. The big rating firms allowed a small percentage of bad loans even in the highest grade bundles. So bad housing loans were bundled with good loans. The bundle (highest grade) was then put into a new bundle with more bad loans and the new bundle would also get the highest grade. The process was then repeated a number of times until there was a large amount of bad loans in a bundle with the highest grade. The bundle was then sold at a premium, because some of the bad loans had really good interest rates. When it was discovered that these highest grade bundle actually contained a large portion of bad loans their value dropped. Some financial institutions were hit so hard that they went insolvent. The US government decided not to bail out of the fairly large players. The result was that all debt of that player became worthless, sending ripples through the banking sector that threatened to bankrupt more banks throughout the world. Without intervention from the governments, there would have been a banking collapse. Meanwhile, some countries in Europe had been lying about their national debt and their budget deficits. When the financial meltdown happened the big banks started to look at other loans that could be lower grade than indicated, and their sights set on the cheating countries. Again, the governments (and the EU) had to intervene. As for voiding national debt: FIAT currencies are only as good as the trust people put in it. If the US would default on its national debt (paper money is debt), what would happen to the trust in the new US dollar? Who would dare accept US dollars or lend money to the US in the future if there is a risk that the money will become worthless? 

Market failures often arise due to deviations from the classical assumptions of economics (e.g. Perfect Competition, Perfect Rationality, Perfect Information, Unbounded Computational Capacity, ...etc). There are lists of well-documented and studied market failures and the factors driving them (monopoly is sometimes considered a case of market failure); however, there cannot be an exhaustive list as that would be equivalent to placing a bound on the number of ways people can behave unexpectedly 

I am not familiar with South Korean data; but I believe the Gini coefficient estimated by the US Current Population Survey does not exclude single households, meaning it's not a universal practice for Gini estimation. 

As suggested by the previous answer, definitely get rid of gas prices and median home value. You might also want to reconsider the way you look at the deficit, debt, and GDP growth rate as these are highly circumstantial; a better way to consider these as performance indicators is to compare their observed values to their trajectories at the end of the term of a predecessor. 

From the quoted snippet it looks like they are describing the effects successful branding has had for US companies and for the US economy. 

Demand: Expected return on investments. If the expected return is much higher than interest rates, then elasticity will be low. When interest rates are close to the expected return elasticity will be high. Supply: Money supply. When money is scarce the elasticity will be low. When money is abundant the elasticity will be high. 

In addition, there is a way for the stock market to generate a higher return without an increase in stock market value: 

Short answer: NO, it doesn't affect inflation. Longer answer follows: The lowest denomination coin usually stands for a very small amount of the total amount of cash. There are a lot of them, but their total worth isn't that great. In Sweden, where I live, the lowest denomination coin has been removed several times. The currency in Sweden is called krona (crown) and has the acronym kr. 1 kr = 100 Ã¶re. Changes in lowest denomination in Sweden (the link leads to page in swedish): 

Used to be capital controls. You could only buy dollars (or any other foreign currency) through official channels at the official favorable rates by providing documentation displaying need for said currency (e.g. Travel or import documents). 

In the framework of the ISLM model, a supply shock would be defined as any exogenous force that affects the ability of an economy to produce its natural level of output, this ability is represented by a production function that often relies on available resources and production technology. Therefore, any factors affecting the availability of resources or technology will be considered a supply shock (e.g. Drought and crops). On the other hand, a demand shock acts on aggregate demand by influencing planned expenditure by economic actors or the amount of real money balances that economic actors desire to hold. In short, if it affects available production inputs or production technology, it's a supply shock. Notice that the GDP is just a measure of all goods and services produced in an economy for a given period of time. If you use the expenditure approach to GDP (Y = C + I + G + NX), a supply shock will not immediately act on this formula, rather it affects the formula Y=F(X) (where X is a vector representing production inputs). But note that the two formulas, meaning the two "Y"'s must equal each other, therefore, there will be changes in the first equation to match the second equation at some level of Y. However, you can't differentiate these changes from changes arising due to a demand shock unless you have the whole story. You can't just look at "C" for instance, and assume that any changes in "C" resulted from a supply shock.
