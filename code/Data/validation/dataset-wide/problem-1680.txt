materials that may well be less hard than diamond (and maybe giving rise to the myth, as hinted at in the same article). 

$URL$ This could well be the origin of this myth, however the poisoning could happen with sealed as well as opened cans. Now, with the scare about BPA poisoning, the internal coating/liner of modern cans is blamed by some for all kinds of scary diseases as well, but as mentioned in other questions there is no real scientific evidence to back up the claims that BPA is toxic in the concentrations found in those linings except maybe for infants. For example a recent US government study indicates that: 

So no, a simple test of scratching glass won't identify a synthetic diamond from a natural one. In fact the synthetic may well scratch things the natural one can't scratch! 

using your own source, it lists authorative sources like the FDA stating that Sucralose/Splenda is safe unless consumed in extreme amounts (at which level pretty much anything is harmful). The only "study" your source lists as "proving" harmful effects requires an intake of 10 times the recommended normal dose over prolonged periods, and even then the effect cannot be replicated in humans. 

While researching this question, everything I found tied back to the Olmsted article. In Wikipedia's article about the "Amish anomaly" it mentions that these claims (of the Amish having a lower prevalence of autism) "originate primarily from columns by Dan Olmsted". Rather than simply demonstrating the claim's notability, that article is actually a source of the claim. I haven't found anything that shows whether or not autism is significantly less common among the Amish, but I have found information that gives good reason to be skeptical of Olmsted's claims. According to "The Truth About The 'Evils' Of Vaccination", Dan Olmsted (the author of the article you linked to) was wrong in that the Amish do vaccinate their children but may be somewhat correct about autism being less prevalent among them. 

There's a good paper titled "Same-Sex Parenting and Children’s Outcomes: A Closer Examination of the American Psychological Association’s Brief on Lesbian and Gay Parenting". They give a pretty good summary of what they are looking at: 

Non-smokers are obviously not addicted to cigarettes. As non-smokers smoker 0 cigarettes a day, and 0 is less than 3, there's some truth to the assertion. 

Thus, it's highly unlikely you'll suffer any ill effects from food exposed to the metal of your can. 

I know this is only one data point, but I've been to Miami several times and never seen fish swim in the streets. Can't say it never happens during storm tides, but if such came so high in Miami that there was large scale flooding it'd make national if not world wide news and I'd almost certainly have heard about it (and so would you). Tides high enough to cause enough water to stand in the streets for fish to swim in would be the result of tsunami like events, which'd wreck the city (think the Indonesia Christmas tsunami, Fukushima, or Katrina). I've not heard of anything even close to such devastation in southern Florida after hurricane Andrew levelled Homestead in the 1980s (I think it was). So if it happened it's almost certainly been decades. And it'd be extremely rare. Were it caused by "sea level rise" Miami would have been abandoned by now, and it'd happen (nearly) every day. 

One complication is that the type of banana popular today is the Cavendish, but prior to the 1950s it was the Big Mike, and it's possible the change to the Cavendish could have significantly reduced the danger of slipping on a peel.

Here's the abstract for the study that found "85% of Amish parents surveyed accept some immunizations". One clarification to note is that the 85% figure is for Amish parents who gave at least some of their children at least one vaccine. I also found the blog post by Prometheus referred to in "Olmsted Lied...". The post links to the study by Strauss et. al. 

According to $URL$ "Elderberry Beats the Flu, Prevents Colds, and Strengthens Your Immunity." As with all dietary advice I find on the internet, I'm hesitant to believe this claim (and I'd be very surprised if the claim wasn't at least overhyped). Does Elderberry really have the claim properties? 

Maybe not what you had in mind, but yes. And it's the UN that's at the core of it (not some "secret society" or "evil capitalists"): $URL$ 

I've been unable to find anything that would suggest a phone that's connected to a charger produces more "radiation" than one that isn't so hooked up. At MOST a phone that's hooked up would be unlikely to have battery saver functions activated, functions that when turned on can do things like lower the power settings for Bluetooth and WiFi, and disable GPS reception, which could count as "producing less radiation". Of course a phone that's being charged while turned on would produce more radiation that one that's turned off, but that's irrespective of whether the phone that's turned off is being charged or not so not a possible explanation for the urban legend either. 

That said, this report $URL$ suggests even secondhand smoke can cause nicotine addiction, one symptom of smoking addiction. $URL$ possibly has more information, don't have time now to browse through the entire site. 

A Facebook friend linked to a claim that I find rather dubious. On the website of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, they talk about health concerns about dairy products and have an infographic that makes some rather bold claims: 

That means over the course of one day, you need to save 1.45 kWh (kilowatt hours) in order to save 25 pence. You can accomplish that by reducing your average energy consumption by 60 watts. According to these numbers, having switched those lights from 400 watts total to 44 watts total should be saving you over £500 each year. This nice table shows the power consumption of different devices while in sleep or standby modes. In particular, they found that a desktop computer uses 21.13 watts while in sleep mode compared to 2.84 while off. If you happen to have three desktop computers, then turning them all off will just about get you to the 60 watts needed to save £90. Because of the variability in power consumption between the various types of devices, how much money you can save will obviously depend on what devices you have, but it does not take too many devices to be able to reduce power consumption by 60 watts. 

First you have to figure out what cans are made of. There's many metals used, and then there's alloys of those metals. Tin (or rather tin plated steel alloy), and aluminium seem the most common. $URL$ 

sexual reproduction would exclude the possibility (as there'd be no way to impregnate them prenatally, obviously, unless you want to have offspring impregnated by their own fathers by encapsulting some of their semen into their bodies during gestation), so you should limit your search to those creatures reproducing a-sexually. The closest I could find quickly was the budding of jellyfish, but that's not really the same. Here a single polyp splits into multiple young jellyfish over time. This is asexual reproduction of a polyp which is itself the result of sexual reproduction. Nice description (with a diagram) on wikipedia: $URL$ More info confirming this on $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

Overall this sounds like just another scare story by people who fear technology (and possibly anything they don't understand). 

Update: Here are two studies that show negative effects. They attempt to use more random samples in order to avoid self-selection bias. Neither can conclusively say what is causing the negative effects - from the former: 

The link to the source of that particular claim is broken, but the name of the article in the broken link is "the Amish anomaly". Searching for that led me to "Olmsted Lied, People Laughed: The 'Amish Anomaly' hoax", which makes Olmsted's claims seem quite dubious: 

It's definitely possible for an eagle to be upside down during flight. Here's a Youtube video titled "Bald Eagle barrel roll". It shows some eagles playing or fighting or something and doing barrel1 rolls in the process. The picture you found could just be a well-timed photograph that happened during the middle of this eagle's roll. Here's a gif showing a closer shot of a bird doing a roll mid-flight. 

Ergo, the only conclusion I can draw from what data I have and know from past study of such systems (a lot of it from printed books) is that no such ballistic missile with the capabilities implied exists in the US arsenal, and that any launch of such if it existed would have been very rapidly detected and responded to by the Russians and possibly others. 

According to this site ($URL$ it does indeed work (and here's another one $URL$ Neither of them reference any scientific study though, and a quick search didn't turn one up (but it could of course be such things are too old to be on the net). And another one: $URL$ Here's a site (one of many) selling garlic based mozzie repellant: $URL$ However this site ($URL$ lists it under folklore, but again without reference. 

The contrary is in part true, in that running barefoot rather than wearing shoes with thick padding and cushioning tends to decrease injury and strengthen the foot and leg muscles. $URL$
