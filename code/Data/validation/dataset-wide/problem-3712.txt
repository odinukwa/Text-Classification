Stair Carry - The same dummy is placed into a carry chair (essentially a chair with rear wheels and grips), we lift it up (again two person lift) then go up and down 3 flights of stairs without lowering the chair I've been working on the basis that the lift for this is similar to the floor lift above (if you're at the feet end) so any advice you could give for the previous lift would probably suffice for that. However when lifting from the head end or when in the carrying position at the feet we are advised to tuck our elbows into our sides and keep your arms in a bicep curl position. Hopefully I can find a picture to illustrate all this more clearly. Therefore in addition to the squats to train my thighs and my above question about the lower legs, I think I have to put some effort into my arms too in order to keep the chair up (once it's off the floor and you're climbing, all the effort is in your arms rather than your legs). For general upper body strength I've been planning to do pushups and reading back it sounds like bicep curls could be a good idea too. Is there anything else that you think would help, or any assumptions that I've made and you can point out are completely wrong? I'd be very grateful for any help you can give me! 

According to this article, Muscle growth starts about 1 hr after a workout and continues for up to 24 hours. It is important to have sufficient protein and slow release carbs to ensure maximum muscle synthesis. 

To answer your question, straight sugar is high in calories but low in fat. Its high in simple carbohydrates. That said, I'm not sure the advice you read was so great. It likely comes from the outdated belief that dietary fat/cholesterol equals fat/cholesterol in your body. Eat too much of any of the 3 macronutrient categories (protein/fat/carbohydrate) and you will get fat. Eating huge amounts of simple carbohydrates and the associated sustained high blood glucose levels over a long period of time can put a strain on your pancreas and in some cases lead to diabetes, varying levels of insulin resistance, and arterial plaque. If you want to put on weight, you have to decide what kind of weight you want to put on. If you want to put on fat, the best way to do that is just to eat lots of food with little or no exercise. If you have a normal digestive system then there is always a point at which your body fails to burn all the calories you consume, and you put on fat. If you have a faster metabolism than average, this will be more food than others eat. If you want to put on muscle, then you have to train hard in the gym whilst eating lots of quality food. I hope that answers your question. 

While doing 3rd set, around 7th or 8th rep, I feel sudden loss of strength in my arms and I feel like dropping weight on my forehead or nose. It only happens with skull crusher and that too with 3rd set (that too at 7/8th rep!), not with any other exercises. Its happening from last 3-4 weeks. What could be the problem? TIA. 

I feel quite a pain in my front delts while doing and for 2 days after. In contrast, if I do the it with a chest machine as shown in the picture, I can lift more weight also (can go around 70-80 kg for 3rd set) and I don't feel any pain(soreness) in delts later. So, can I continue doing it with machine itself? What's wrong with my barbell bench press? 

Usually I do flat skull crushers for Triceps but I have seen some guys doing it in incline and decline way. What is the difference between incline, decline and flat modes? Is it same as we do incline/decline (dumbbell/barbell) press for chest? 

I am aware of that per kg protein intake and all. AFA my routine is concerned, I workout in the evening (around 8 - 9.30 p.m). Before workout, I take 1 scoop of protein (25gm protein) and after workout 1 scoop. Along with a scoop of protein after workout, I also take 2 boiled eggs (10gm protein) and a glass of milk (mixed with protein, around 8gm protein) + whatever I get from my dinner. So, this all counts around 70gm of protein in a time span of around 1.5 - 2 hours. I read somewhere that its of no use to take more amount of protein at a time. Is that true? 

Scientific evidence seems to suggest that nutrition timing is NOT as important as most think. Most of the "common knowledge" surrounding this is based on statistics that show correlations. With plenty of ulterior causations to choose from (e.g. those snacking at night are more likely to get fat because they are eating more food overall), there is no point changing behaviour based on this. There is NO real evidence that if eating a controlled diet, nutrition timing does much at all. Our bodies adapt to whatever we throw at it. Its the daily macronutrient totals that are important. You will find this article very interesting. 

With the other nonsense removed, all we have left is to gain some muscle. You may want to stop gaining muscle when you reach your 'aesthetic' ideal. Great. You will have PLENTY of time to stop as gaining muscle does not happen overnight - or without hard work. Actively aim to lift MORE every set. More reps or more weight. If you aren't lifting more in any way (reps/weight) then assume you haven't grown muscle and immediately take a good hard look at your diet (are you eating enough?) or your intensity (are you really pushing yourself to the max). Remember, to put on muscle you need to become a bigger, stronger version of your current self. Your stronger future self will be capable of lifting a lot more than you are lifting now. Break this ultimate goal into smaller goals (rep/weight targets). If you are lifting to failure your reps will look something like 12,10,8,6. If you have been capable of doing 4 sets of 12 it means you were really lazy on the first 2 sets (or perhaps too preoccupied counting the time it takes to rep up and down). Advice 

In a few months I'll have to do the standard lifting assessment for patient transport work in the UK. I'm only very slight myself so I'm looking to improve my lifting capabilities in the intervening months, unfortunately I don't have access to a gym so am very limited in the equipment I have access to. The assessment is in two parts and I'd like advice as to whether I'm working the right muscle groups: 

I just bought some push-up bars to give my wrists a break and was interested to see that the leaflet in it was keen to advise me that "it is very important to breathe normally whilst exercising - do not hold your breath". Apart from the obvious, why is this good advice? Does it affect the gain in muscle you get or is it just so you don't pass out? 

lifting an object from the floor with a straight back holding an object at chest height for an extended period of time whilst climbing stairs 

*with better manual handling technique than that! Anyway for this I've been assuming that as I'm starting in a squatted position then lifting up with bent knees I'll need to work on my thigh muscles. To this end I've been doing squats, is there anything else I could be doing? Would I need to work on my lower legs too? 

I have successfully reduced my body fat from 15% to 8.5%. Keep in mind these are pinch tests so the over all body fat calculated percentage might be a bit off. My abdominal skin fold measures 7.1mm. I eat 3000 calories a day and whenever I try reduce this, I lose muscle (which results in an identical or worsened overall body fat percentage). Its almost as if my body doesn't want to lose any more fat. I don't do ANY cardio - just hard & heavy (to me at least) weight training 4 or 5 times a week. What cardio should I try putting in (assuming that will get me down)? Anyone tried and had success with intermittent fasting? I'm ALMOST happy with my physique. I would hate to come all this way and not achieve a full shredded physique. Here is a picture. You can see that blob of fat where the bottom 2 abs should be. 

Add to that a quality fish oil, a multivitamin, and probiotics for digestive health. All weights are uncooked and 'meat' refers to anything lean (chicken breast skinless, lean beef mince, tuna, etc). Veggies excludes potatoes - just stick to green fibrous like broccoli. Protein powder must be low carb as possible (no sugar). Drink plenty of water (at least 3.5 litres) but not on top of a stomach full of food! Remember, its mostly about FOOD. As well as all this, you should be training about 3 or 4 times a week and HARD. Train every set to failure. Record your reps/weights and ensure you are always adding reps or weights (ever increasing intensity). There is a lot more to it all but this will be a good start. 15-20 reps on the compounds like squats and deadlifts will burn the most fat whilst growing (or at least maintaining) muscle. Forget cardio - and forget situps. It sounds like you already have a grasp on listening to your body. At first you will feel like you are forcing food in and intuitively you will feel like you are eating too much. This will quickly change as your metabolism gets up a gear. You will enjoy sustained energy levels throughout the day. Good luck. 

From my personal experience, daily I do leg raises but on a bench with hands holding head end of the bench (almost same as lying on floor). I never felt it uncomfortable and there are no side effects AFAIK (I am doing it from quite a long time). In fact, I felt it more comfortable than lying on floor version. 

A guy in my gym suggested not to work for abs after regular/other body part workout. Reason was that, if you do abs after regular workout, muscles get loose and your workout will go waste. How true it is? 

Usually, I do skull crusher exercise (1st or 2nd exercise of Triceps day and neutral position with an EZ bar) 3 sets with following weights (8-11 reps range). Earlier I used to do 20kg max (for 3rd set). Increasing weight in time. 

Saturday, whole day I go to play cricket and Sunday is rest day. While doing Chest workout, I feel more pressure on shoulders as most of the chest workouts involve Shoulder movement (Chest workout comes after Shoulder in my routine). So, I am thinking to interchange Lats/Back workout with Shoulder which seems fine. Please let me know your thoughts about it. 

As your body adapts, your 100% will become faster and stronger. Your body will drop fat and you will build muscle in your upper and lower body. 

The exercise famous for being hard on the knees is the leg press - not squat. If the squat is done with the correct depth (hip lower than the knee) so that the change of direction is NOT done while the knees are at right angles, it shouldn't hurt the knees. If you get some soft knee wraps you might be able to convince her to squat with those. If not - I would highly recommend lunges holding dumbbells. They train similar muscles. 

I appreciate that you are new to lifting weights etc - but let me save you years of wasted workouts by blowing apart some common myths you have referred to. 

For normal people, a diet high in protein is NOT harmful. Its beneficial. High protein keeps you feeling full longer. Contrary to what I've read on this forum, your body can utilise (for energy, muscle growth) as much protein as you throw at it per meal. It is a great food for sustained energy levels throughout the day. A high protein (up to 50%) diet is popular with athletes around the world. As for protein in powder form, yes there have been some heavy metals found in them. Some fish also has this. Long story short, there is nothing magical about whey proteins so if you have any health concerns, eat more chicken/beef/eggs instead! Here is a great article from a very well-respected natural body builder (and power lifter) that did his PHD in protein metabolism.
