If your tyre says 700x28c, that means your wheel has 700c of diameter and your tyre is size 28. You should buy a tube that perfectly fits this, and this is very easy as because tubes have, in the box, the diameter of the wheel they were made for, in your case 700c, and the range of the tires they are made for. So if the tube says 24-26 that is ok for you, if it says 24-28 that is also ok for you, etc. According to your description you bought the correct tube, so what the hell is wrong? A few things might have made your flat, in particular there are three typical suspects: a) Maybe your tyre has a glass or a small nail in it, and you didn't check. You removed the old tube and get the new one and the this fragment remained on the tyre, so it flat after a while. b) Your rimstrip is weak and does not hold the pressure, forces the tube against the holes on the rim and they end up puncturing. The solution for a) and b) is pretty simple. When you have a flat, remove the tube very careful so that you know it's original position on the tyre. Check if the position of the flat in the tyre and see if there anything stuck in it. If the hole on the tube is on the inside, then it's time to change your rimstrip to something more sturdier. c) You did a bad job installing the tube. Make sure the tube sits perfectly inside the tyre, and that no parts remain stuck between the tyre and the rim before inflating. To do this it might help to inflate the tube a little but before installing, and check everything after installation but before inflating. Check this guide for detailed instructions. As a side note, I personally don't like fixing tubes as the patch does not expand as well the the rubber of the tube when you inflate and you create a week point there prone to give some problem in the future. 

A couple of things could be the reason of your derailleur shifting on its own. I assume that both the derailleurs and the shifters are in good working order, that you washed and lubricated them and correct adjust them with the respective screws. Please refer to Park Tools repair help guide to correctly set all these adjustments. You can find it here and please bookmark it, because their site is nothing short of amazing. And now that we are talking about this, also check for the rear derailleur hanger alignment, as you can see here. Now that we know this is not a problem, the main reason of poor shifting is your cables being dirty and/or simply old. Replace everything, inner and outer cables. Buy the cheapest ones is usually good enough, a good tip is to put teflon-based oil (cheapest you can find, it's a good buy because you will use it for the derailleurs, chain, etc) inside the outer tube before putting the inner tube in. This will ensure good operation for a long time. About you bike's cable routing, you can find a new plastic piece for your frame here (make sure this is the correct model). I wouldn't bother if yours look good, just clean it. The type of routing on your bike is definitely not the best (as you can see lots of debris accumulate there), but that's ok. There is a neat thing you can do: pass the cable for the front derailleur through the standard places (down the inner tube), but for the rear derailleur use a big outer tube that goes all the way from the shifter to the derailleur (check what works best with your bike frame, if down the top tube/seatstays or through the down tube/chainstays, and choose whichever route because since we are using a outer tube debris are not a problem anymore). This will ensure that cable stays clean and protected and your shifting should be good for a longer time. You can buy cable guides like these (there are more types, just google for it) but I would just use zip ties and do something like this. Be patience and good luck! :) 

As is true with everything, there might one or two exceptions on top-end models (usually fashion top-end, not performance top-end, i.e., the bike brands that you see on podiums ALL run hydraulic disc brakes) where there will be cable-actuated disc brakes, but what more convincing can I do when I tell you that everybody concerned with performance runs hydraulics? Road-racing is an exception, but is mostly political-derived. In 1 or 2 years you will see professionals on the Tour with hydraulics, and most big brands already have them for sale. Maybe sooner 1 2 It is also true hydraulic disc brakes have their specific problems - such as the fluid boiling, but these are solved in most modern iterations of hydraulics, road or mountain. Modern hydraulic disc brakes are reliable, easy to modulate and extremely powerful. Even the cheapest models, for example. Of course you will hear all sorts of people saying how their disc brakes gave them problems, but this is true for everything. Suspensions, wheels, frames (cars, the latest Ferrari 458 and Porsche GT3 both had a problem where they catch fire, and they are extremely high-end products. Sometimes these things just happen and a bad series leaves the fabric). Cannodale, a really good brand, has a recall because a fork could potentially break, which is extremely dangerous. Is cannondale a bad brand? No, this just happens sometimes. There are disadvantages of course, mainly that maintenance is potentially more costly as you will need to bleed them every once (a year? I do it every two, never had problems) in a while (my shop charges $60), but hydraulics are totally worth it: they are more powerful and easier to modulate. For example, you can brake with one finger - they are that easy to modulate and that powerful, while you keep most of your hand holding the handlebar, having a better overall control. Do this with mechanics.. They require less continuous maintenance then cables and nowadays you can buy a nice brake for ~$70 (here), or a decent set for $100 (here). But despite this big discussion, the best think you can do is go to a shop and try both: I am sure you will be convinced. 

I would probably eat them if they look and taste ok. Also check if the package looks ok (and is not swallow, for example). It is up to you though. Ask yourself: would you eat an yogurt or cookies in the same situation? It is not because these are made of sugar that they hold better or not. Some products do, some products don't, and the manufacturer of your gels knows your product better than you, and set an expiration date for a reason. This is true for all edible products, energy gels are no different. 

In this manual, they state the torque for the Giant Defy seatpost should be around 50kgf-cm (5Nm). I know this is for the carbon frame, but they should be similar. You can buy a torque wrench for around $30, which you should, because otherwise there is a high chance you will under or over tight it. I know $30 is a pain in the ass, but think this will keep your $1000 bike running smoothly for a long time. 

Epic Bleed Solution did an amazing post explaining the details of hydraulic disc brakes, covering concepts and mechanic principles, different fluids, pads, rotors, etc. It's a very good introduction to hydraulic disc brakes that you can find here: $URL$ 

As always, it's hard to diagnose something with such a brief description and without looking at it, but the most likely cause is air in your brake system. Brake systems are designed to work with your bike standing still, where any small amount of air is pushed by gravity to the reservoir of the levers, keeping the system working well. When you move your bike around and put it in strange positions, or when you store it vertically, this changes, gravity now pushes oil into the reservoir and air to the lever. This means when you start riding there is actual air somewhere where it shouldn't be and the brake don't feel right. If you keep your bike still for a few minutes this "resets", and air goes back to the reservoir and the brakes star working ok. On the beginning of a ride, and mostly if you store your bike vertically, you should always test the brakes and give them a few minutes for oil to go "down" and air "up", and press the levers a few times because this creates mechanical pressure on the lever so that it gets filled with oil and air is pushed into the reservoir. This is actual advised in some brakes manuals. It doesn't hurt to bleed your brakes and take as much air out as you can, and now that you are at it, check if the system is well isolated, i.e., check for small spills of oil in the calipers and levers and around the tubes. A problem in the system is not a likely cause as the brakes would always perform poorly instead of only after you moved your bike, but it doesn't hurt to take a look. Happy riding! 

That is a pin (which you have) and a clip (which you don't). They are part of the brakes's Pad Retention system. They are important because they ensure the brake pads stay in place. You can buy them online, here for example, but if your local shop is cool they should give you one from the lots of spares they have. Take it easy using your bike while you don't get it fixed. 

There is a certain degree of compatibility, but usually it comes with a big compromise, such as having to use a flat handlebar (for your MTB shifters and brakes), smaller diameter wheels (road is 28", your MTB is likely 26"), lower gearing (pedaling on road is easier so gears are higher) or bigger than usual tires (because of your wide MTB rims). By the time you found a road frame that supports discs and bought all the non inter-changeable components you will see it's not worth it. If you are really really interested in doing this you can post a few pictures of your current MTB and the kind of bike you are looking for and we can help you component by component, but trust me, you will end up getting a road bike. 

I don't completely agree with some things that have been said here. If you like old bikes, if you want it for the looks, go for it. It is a perfectly good reason, lots of people buy and maintain old bikes because they are classier and prettier. There is nothing wrong with it, your passion is perfectly respectable. I personally think something like this is absolutely gorgeous. Just be careful when picking one, because age and rust attack the frame and components, so you should be careful that the frame is not too rusty if you want to recover it, and inspect the bike for cracks every week or so. On the other hand, while it is (arguably) true there hasn't been a huge advance in bike mechanics in the last years, it is also true new advancements in materials, manufacturing techniques and mechanical principles make new components much better and durable. I guarantee you a new, 2015 derailleur will last much longer than a new one made 25 years ago. It will because even though the mechanical principle is the same, a new derailleur has better bearings, better isolated, and the whole construction is more solid meaning there are less tolerances when it is shifting which will end up making it perform better and last longer. This is true for all other components, but mainly for ones that have movement: hubs, headsets, cranks for example. The better quality in modern products will also be more noticeable when you are using the bike, as it will feel more solid and flex less under hard pedaling, brakes will work better, wheel will flex much less, etc. Of course if you compare an old Dura Ace derailleur (some of the best) with a super cheap one sent to you from China for $10 the old one might be better, but if you compare a 25 (from the 90's) year old Dura Ace with a modern Tiagra (some of the cheapest Shimano makes), I guarantee you the new one will perform much, much better. I have used them side by side and 25 years of evolution make a big, big difference. Just look at them, old and new. See how different are the brakes for example? More material, less flex, better bearings, a mechanical principle revised for decades, all means they will last longer and perform much, much better. As true for most things, using an older vehicle (car, motorcycle, boat, bicycle) means you will have necessarily less performance and more maintenance costs. I am not saying an older bike will make you go bankrupt, and it will last if you treat her well, but trust me, there will be a difference. If nevertheless you want to go for the older one, I can't do anything else but pay you a nice, cold beer when I see you with it. 

You can find detailed information about all the setting for a rear derailleur here, including the screw (B-screw) that adjusts distance to the bike frame. You should adjust this AFTER the other two screws that adjust upper and lower limits relating to the cassette are properly adjusted, so follow ALL the steps one by one and you should be good. It is also possible your derailleur hanger needs alignment. Watch your bike from behind and see if the body of the derailleur goes down parallel to the bike frame. If it doesn't, you need to adjust with a specific tool, so you should take your bike to a shop because it's not worth buying it. You can find more information about hanger adjustment here. Good luck!
