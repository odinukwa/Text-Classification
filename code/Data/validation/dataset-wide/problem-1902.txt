I went in for a technical job interview with a small company where they described the process as speaking with two or three groups of people for about 1+ hour each. They mentioned that they liked everyone in the tech group to meet candidates to get a feel for them. Everyone was friendly and it started great. The first group asked general background questions as well as some straight forward technical questions and white board programming. Very much the usual, but also some subjective stuff. They then left me alone while they went to another part of their office to find the other interviewers. At this point the HR contact that originally greeted me came and informed me that the others were quite busy and wouldn't be able to meet. This seemed odd of course. The interview was over and they would be in touch about potential next steps, showing me out. I asked if they'd like to reschedule with the other interviewers, but he said they'd discuss it. As I left I knew there wouldn't be next steps, and a few days later this was confirmed over email. Obviously not all interviews go well and not all candidates fit. Is it however professional to end an interview abruptly midway if the first part isn't ideal? What if the later parts provided some additional info to offset the first interviewer's judgement? 

No, your friend should not disclose deafness on a resume/CV or cover letter unless it will help her get a job. It might be helpful if the job is in a medical field or working with deaf people or similar. Otherwise, it just gives employers a reason to not interview her. If she can do the job without any accommodation (or if in the US, with reasonable accommodation as per the Americans with Disabilities Act), then she should avoid mentioning it to a company at least until she is offered an interview. If they want do a phone interview and she can't do that, then she can mention it at that time. The company might choose to do the interview in person or via Skype or other video chat. If they want to do an in-person interview and no special accommodations are required, then she can either mention it when the interview is confirmed or wait until she arrives. If minor accommodations are required, then she should say so when the interview is confirmed, just as you would do if an interview would include lunch and you have dietary restrictions. Even if an employer isn't overtly prejudiced, they might feel awkward about interviewing someone who is deaf, thinking they won't know how to act. Avoiding mentioning it early on will allow the employer to evaluate your friend's qualifications without that bias being a factor, even a subconscious one. 

I've encountered this in past. I think the spirit of the entertaining and hosting is what matters, not what you're drinking. A good idea would be to invite them to a social venue that has drinks but also food. Offer them drinks if they want, but get yourself a soft drink, "club soda with lime", or some other non-alcoholic drink. You could get water, but that sets a non-participatory tone sometimes. A good idea is to also order snack food. Often in business circles, people will not immediately jump on the idea, but as a host you should order some initial food ideas for the table. So, it's more about being a host than what anyone is drinking. 

bethlakshmi is right on target. I'm also a software developer who used to have a repetitive stress injury, so I'm in almost exactly your situation. I use an ergonomic keyboard and a keyboard tray; without them I'd feel it by the end of a single work day. When I recently changed jobs, I only mentioned this when I called the hiring manager to accept the offer, as I had done with the previous two jobs. Any employer that's hiring you as a software developer will be spending a ton of money on you, paying salary and benefits, as well as the cost of your computer. An ergonomic keyboard and a trackball won't cost more than a few hundred dollars at the very most, so it's really not going to be an issue for an employer. (It so happens that I own an extra keyboard of the kind that I prefer, so I brought it in and use it at work.) I like saying it when I accept an offer, because at that point I can tell them that I need a keyboard tray, and here's what kind, and I need this kind of ergonomic keyboard, and they can order them and have them ready for my first day at work. The right attitude for this is "I need some inexpensive equipment to do my job effectively, and I'm going to be a great new employee." (It shouldn't be relevant to any halfway-decent employer, but this blog post notes that carpal tunnel syndrome "may be a disability under the ADA." If you're in the US and are going to work for a really big company with a bureaucratic HR department and they give you any hassle, just use the phrase "reasonable accomodation" and mention the ADA, and they'll be very much inclined to do what you request.) 

I've been freelancing for a former colleague of mine who has started a new business. I've known the colleague about 4 years professionally, and he reached out to me to join his business as an employee. The new company is made of mostly ex-colleagues of his so far. He has given me a full time offer contingent on the business reaching its next funding goal, likely in 1-2 months. The problem is the salary offer is about 15-25% lower than my previous job, depending on if I ignore the bonus factor. My previous salary was generous overall. I'm curious how I might negotiate this to a more reasonable number? At the very least I'd like not to take a paycut from my previous base salary. I've seen that the company is doing well so far, and the next funding will solidify it, so I don't think they are hurting for cash. The unique factor seems to be that he specifically sought me out for the position based on my unique skillset to offer within the new company, I'm the lead. I've got 10 years experience in what I do, and have created similar things to what they want in past, with lots of transferable knowledge/tools. I plan to use the next 2 months to deliver amazing results, such that he wouldn't want anyone else for the role. No one better, and no one new either. What is the best approach at getting the 15-25% more I expect? I feel like if I just stated the minimal 15% higher, it would be compromised down to somewhere lower. And if I stated "I was thinking 15-25% higher than this number", 15% is the best that would be possible. If I went high at 25% more, it might be considered absurd. At the same time, I'm interested in continuing this role, so he may know I'm not going to walk away from the low offer. I've been interviewing elsewhere with no offers yet, perhaps I play-up other company's interest? 

I don't know if it's exactly impolite, but it's certainly not ideal. You say you're working hard on improving your soft skills, but responding to praise or recognition gracefully is a soft skill you still need to work on. A better response that gets in your point that you deserved it would be something like "Thank you! I've been working very hard to be useful to the company and improve my skills, and it's gratifying to have my efforts recognized. I hope to continue to improve in the future and have a rewarding career here. And thank you for (putting me on such an exciting project) or (supporting my growth) or (something your manager has done that's helpful)". 

If one receives a job offer, should the vacation time be explicitly stated and exact? I received one such for an early employee for a very small and new startup, where the offer received mentioned "participation in company vacation plan when established". The general informal vacation policy currently seems to be take what you need within-reason, get your work done, etc. People just post it to a calendar, etc. The informality is not a big deal, and I do not expect needing extensive vacation. However, I'd be more worried about not taking any, leaving the company potentially, and them not needing to pay out any unused vacation time because it wasn't stated. Should I push for exact vacation numbers even before they've established the policy? The pros would be payout-requirements, and firmness, the cons might be less stated time than the informal policy allows for.
