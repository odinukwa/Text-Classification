The insider Admin copies some sensitive financial data and electronically sends it out of the company to himself or a competitor. Competitive intelligence is lost, and the economic value of the lost data can be significant, maybe even business survival relevant. 

When I was composing my application for a position, I saw the position listed on my University Career Services website and the same position listed directly on the company website. Direct submittal through the company website does not let me attach a cover letter but only a basic applicant profile. Do hiring managers have a preference for how the application is submitted - Directly through the company website or through a third party such as Career Services at my university? I am a graduate student with a MS degree and am looking to work full time in financial services industry. 

What I will be saying is from personal experience. I have found that creating rapport with the candidate puts them at ease. When I was interviewing, I appreciated interviewers who really got to know me as a person and evaluated my competencies through conversation rather than interrogation. Direct questioning would undoubtedly add to the nervousness of the candidate. I also found environment to be a big influence. Try to create an environment that is welcoming rather than cold, such as directly across a barren desk, as the desk symbolizes a psychological barrier that impedes open dialogue. 

From your question, it seems reasonable to infer you work in Human Resources. Screening candidates and discussion of their qualifications in a call such as the one that you describe is often privy only to HR personnel. Hence, you should discuss with your departmental management. It is to their and the company's best interests to stop this behavior ASAP because it exposes the company to legal liability

I work as an IT Auditor as the lead / most senior member of a team of 5, including myself. Currently we are looking to work with a new vendor to replace our current vendor for a specific business process. Today my boss called me into a meeting and stated he would like me to go onsite at the vendor for a security risk assessment. This proposed vendor is fairly large, and will be handling sensitive company information (PII). The scope is fairly involved and includes many areas to review such as access, data protection, BCP/DRP...etc. Given the size of the proposed vendor and the sensitivity of the service they provide to us, I would like at least 1 other member of the team to accompany me onsite for process walkthroughs, interviews...etc. to maximize coverage. However, when I raised my request to my boss, he seemed hesitant and stated we have other pressing work (ex: SOX preparation) to do. If 2 members go, 3 will remain, which I feel is adequate coverage. I also think this is a good learning opportunity for younger team members. (I stated in some of my previous questions team members sometimes lack experience). Meeting and learning to evaluate a vendor can be quite educational. How can I persuade my manager allow additional team members to accompany me? 

You have done very well in fulfilling your responsibilities as a IT security professional. Effective documentation and appropriate escalation are the first steps in making management aware of this issue. As to how to gain momentum in changing situation, does your company undergo independent audits either from external parties or internally through an internal audit function? If yes, does your company maintain a security policy guiding the actions and expectations of end users? Depending on the size and maturity of your company, a documented information security policy should be in place. If the answer to both of the above questions is yes, then a competent and independent assurance / compliance function should document the non-compliance issue during the next audit done. The report will be an additional source of leverage for management to change, as such reports are often required to be seen and acknowledged by senior management. A major issue with your current policy I see working in the IT security profession as an IT auditor, is that users at a lower level of authority can override a restriction given by a higher level of authority, which violates the principle of least privilege. This problem poses major risk to your company in terms of liability. 

In the company where I work, I have frequently found that information silos are a hinderance to team efficiency. The team whom I am a part of is small, 8 employees. To cite some examples, when I ask a question of my colleagues ,responses often include the lines of: 

Finally, IT security is about risk and the acceptance or mitigation of such risk. It may be that your management has a large security risk appetite, and is willing to accept security risks surrounding this application. Alternatively, the control environment / tone at the top at the company, may be lax. I.e: management may be pushing back because they simply don't care. Think of the control environment (or the lack thereof) at companies such as Enron, WorldCom, Tyco.. In either of the above cases, you may have to accept your ability to initiate change is limited by company culture and operating philosophy. 

Working in audit at my company, I have faced several instances of the type you describe above - colleagues being reluctant to accept responsibility or be accountable for an end result. I have found that appealing to their self interest and reminding them of a common goal greatly helps, in my case, enforcing the sound functioning of company IT processes. By accepting accountability for a particular weakness found, such as data integrity issues or systematic failure to follow programming change control per company policy, my colleagues are taking the first step to remedy the issue and in the the process, making their work easier. Having independent assurance that data is complete, accurate and timely increases the reliability of one's work relying on such data. Hence, by cooperating, they are helping themselves by making their work more trustworthy and more easily accepted. To further gain their confirmation / acceptance, I state simply that I am saying what I am saying, not because of bias or a personal grudge, but rather to fulfill my professional responsibility and due care as an auditor. 

Advising on the handling of sensitive information, such as PII in this case, is something I do as part of my work as an IT auditor. I would suggest you first consult any official company policy, if they exist. Most decent sized companies have internal policies over confidentiality and data protection, specifying how sensitive data is to be handled and protected if distributed. You should consult your IT Security team, or IT in general if a dedicated Security function does not exist.

What are some programs available to support new employees? Can you describe how teams collaborate or interact in working on a project What is the development philosophy / focus on interactive methods such as pair programming. 

I am currently a CFA candidate pursuing the chartered financial analyst certification from the CFA institute. This certification demonstrates expertise in investments knowledge and is highly regarded as prestigious by employers alike. I will be taking the level I exam this December. Would it be premature to include the fact that I am a CFA candidate in the achievements section of my resume? Does this carry any weight , or would it just be extraneous / negative? Thank you and I appreciate any feedback from the community. 

As a former IT auditor, you should have experience with IT general controls, application controls, and IT security. Having had exposure to IT controls and IT security will serve you well as with this knowledge you will be able to recognize and mitigate software vulnerabilities that may later be exploited. It should also serve you well with the QA who will be testing your code, as their work is somewhat easier when best practices are followed. 

Finally, you can let management know that current practice exposes themselves to risk. They can no longer deny individual responsibility if something were to break, as accounts are shared. Rational management should be able to realize that by stopping such practice, it serves their own best interests. If your management insists in keeping the policy as is, the best bet is to establish frequent audits of such computers and a "designated owner within IT" to be held responsible for accounts and password management. Management should decide and document its decisions in a policy on how shared accounts can be used such as which users are authorized to use your particular account to logon. Read this article from SANS for detailed best practices around shared accounts that can help you in your discussion with management. 

In this manner, it does not seem the effect of remediation is merely personal satisfaction and / or arbitrary, but that your actively involved in helping to better the company by reducing risk exposure. Most management is reasonable and rational, and they should understand, in a sense you and them have a common interest. I am not sure what country you are in or whether this obligation applies, but if you are in the United States and are a CPA in public practice, you have a duty under professional audit guidelines of the AICPA to report to the board or "those charged with governance" certain matters encountered in the audit. One such issue you should communicate is that you encountered significant difficulty in performing the audit (paragraph .34) 

You are in management and your job is to manage. So do so. The employee you mentioned in your questions needs to realize you have the authority over the group, which includes himself. Try to have a private talk with him and discuss the following: 

It is unfortunate that you are being harassed after returning from maternity leave, given such a leave is a private matter, strictly concerning you and no one else, perhaps save for your direct supervisor. However: 

You can still be diligent about your work, but view the feedback as an opportunity to improve your work, rather than a personal attack about how you work. Different people have different styles to working that works for them and reasonable colleagues should be able to understand. Separating the messenger from message itself is an important skill, particularly when the message may be distasteful, as I surmise in this instance. 

I work in the Info. Sec / IT Audit fields as an IT auditor. As a result of closely working with other professionals in my field, I have a pretty extensive network, which includes people who **currently provide audit / assurances services to my current employer. A personal friend of mine is currently looking for a job in the information security / assurance / audit profession. He is a hardworking, dependable, person with a great personality who I feel would be an asset to almost any company in my profession. From casual conversation, I know our vendors are hiring. Given that he is qualified, can I recommend him to one of our vendors without facing a conflict of interest? Am I overthinking this? I don't want to be seen as trying to influence the relationship between client (us) and our external auditors as independence, trust, and integrity are key assets for someone working in my profession. 

Yes, definitely You should have left sooner, as soon as you felt your professional relationship with your coworkers is damaged and has little chance of making amends. It is also time to let bygones be bygones. Having a bitter attitude about the behavior of others, for which you can't control is not helpful to establishing yourself at your new place of work. Growing a thicker skin and realizing you can only control how YOU react to others will do you well in your future career. 

First I would contend that your experience fixing and and maintaining computers is non - CS related. The experience is valuable and shows you have the ability to apply your theoretical knowledge in a professional work place. The 5 years in which you worked as a security officer is also valuable as this work likely requires strong integrity, responsibility, and attention to detail. These traits are very attractive to a potential employer. Yes, you should most definitely put these experience on your resume.

I am an currently IT Auditor and I say you should embrace the ~ 2 years of experience you had in IT audit and describe how you are likely to be a better developer because of it. Your past experience as an IT auditor should be very valuable particularly in the below areas: 

Why does them being a woman have any bearing on how you interact with them in a professional workplace? To have a professional relationship, you should interact with them in the same manner as you do with men in a professional setting - with respect. Colleagues, irrespective of male or female, appreciate and expect professionalism, respect, and recognition for the merit of work well done. A colleague's gender is irrelevant to how one should conduct oneself in a workplace, and no special preference should be shown in one's professional conduct solely due to the colleague being female. To show special deference, or to apply different standards of conduct when interacting with women can even be perceived as insulting. She is no different from any other colleague, other than she is a woman. Some of the comments below say this might be dangerous or ill -advised because of one's behavior with men. If you treat men "roughly" because its accepted within your culture, then no you should not extend this treatment to women. As mentioned by @ Matthew Read in a comment, rather than look for the lowest common denominator and adapt to the "culture", be the change you want to see and treat all with respect. In the end, I will borrow a quote from @ Patricia Shanahan and say this "You should speak and interact with them just like male colleagues."
