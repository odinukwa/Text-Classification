Judging by the way the crack is moving up the back of the bat it needs some form of repair or strengthening before it breaks. Depending on where your based I'd try and find a local bat maker or contact the shop you bought it from to get Kookaburra to look at it. I've generally found the bigger brands won't deal with you direct, you have to go via the shop. Judging by the face you've already had this taped at the toe, it's probably worth reapplying some tape if you need to use this while you arrange a repair. 

I doubt there is one single reason although the overlap of the IPL and the English domestic season has been a major contributing factor. Many higher profile (centrally contracted) English players would not be available for the whole tournament. Its likely that other players such as Alex Hales and Samit Patel who would be available for the whole tournament were not viewed as good value for money as their county sides would only release them from the domestic contract if they achieved a certain price in the auction. 

It's essentially a cup with curved sides that provide a degree of grip to the ball. The action of flicking the Sidearm at the batsman gives the ball enough momentum of it's own to break out of the cup and head to the batsman on it's own. It's developed from a device used by dog owners to throw tennis balls. 

I've no empirical evidence to back it up but I don't believe they hamper the performance of the bat and they do take some of the impact. I have a five or six year old bat with a lot less horizontal cracking than I have previous had in bats of a similar vintage. For what it's worth I'd recommend fitting it. If you are going to fit it, take the tape off the edges first and then re-apply new tape after the anti scuff is on or it'll all get a bit messy. Personally I use the clear one, it looks nicer for a start! I think the best you can get is helicopter scuff sheet which is clear. If you goto $URL$ and search for scuff sheet there you will find more than enough analysis of it! 

With your action, go back to whatever feels natural. Don't think about what your doing too much just bowl, you'll need to practice it for a while to get it consistent. For your run up, I'd experiment to find something that works for you. You want to be comfortable and balanced when you reach the crease so try different lengths of run up until you find the one that suits you. Ideally, you have to find these things for yourself, other people can advise on how to find it or fine tune what you have but you should try and work your own basic action and run up out for yourself as this will help you throughout your cricket career. Good Luck and have patience with the process! 

What's interesting is that this ball has the same model name TF-1000 as one of Spalding's regular balls, which you can get in multiple varieties (Classic, Legacy, etc) for a wide variety of prices from Amazon Germany. Does anyone know the differences between the Euroleague, Classic, and Legacy versions of this ball? 

Match kits (shirt, shorts and socks), both at the national and club level, are designed and determined in advance. Bigger clubs have new designs pretty much every year, most likely to sell more shirts whereas national teams usually get a new design for 2-4 years (major cups). Teams typically have 2-3 kits. The idea is to have a home and an away shirt, and possibly alternative(s) to ensure there is enough contrast between the competing teams on the field. As for the boots, it's pretty much free.. Most players have sponsorship deals with brands and thus wear a shoe they prefer from that brand. For instance, Messi has long been a brand figure (even has a line of products) for Adidas and thus wears Adidas shoes. Similarly Cristiano Ronaldo and Nike.. Interesting to note that Adidas and Nike also produce the match kits for the respective countries. However I think this is merely coincidental, as I have seen players that wear shoes from a different brand than the kit supplier. I'll look for evidence :) 

I could not find an explicit description of this situation in the NBA rulebook, particularly Rule #8 which governs out-of-bounds and throw-ins. However, it is clearly stated that the ball is out-of-bounds if it's in contact with a player who's out-of-bounds, which the thrower has to be. Thus the ball is not in play until the thrower releases the ball, thus a "sneak-steal" should presumably not be allowed. 

In addition to all these answers I'd also like to point out that a sub in the OT could also serve to "cool down" a hellbent fierce opposition who's trying desperately to get a goal. With some 30 sec.s of pause, you give your players some little time to catch their breath, hopefully help them think properly while the opposition will most certainly be annoyed by the pause and will be force to remount an attacking position. With only a couple of minutes to go, it could take them sometime to get back in to the rhythm. 

My understanding after reading the rules is: as far as the touch does not move the table it should be O.K. otherwise it's a point to the opponent. The last three (in italic) points govern the "contact": 

Besides these you can of course shoot with your toes, or heel etc, but that's not that much different than shooting with your knee or shin; the ball hits you somewhere and if you are lucky and get a "clean" hit then the ball bounces back towards the goal. I would not recommend relying on a toe-shot (even though we have seen several scored this world cup like Oscar's goal vs Croatia) as it's weak and typically very straight ball path. As for how to improve: practice makes perfect. Look for drills, take shots against a wall, against targets, ask tips and pointers from friends. I typically play with the ball before and after the games, and aim at the goal, the posts, the crossbar, any signs or lampposts, even friends. Even that counts as practice... The more shots you take, the better your foot and your brain understands the ball paths, and amount of power you need to put in to get the shot right.
