Two things to note here. First, subtracting inflation from the nominal interest rate is an approximation to the real interest rate, but only in discrete time. Furthermore, the "true" relationship it's approximating isn't division of one rate by the other--you have to add 1 to all three of your quantities (inflation, real interest rate, and nominal interest rate) first to get the true relationship. Here's a brief overview. Consider the Fisher equation of $r = i - \pi$ where $r$ is the real interest rate, $i$ is the nominal interest rate, and $\pi$ is the inflation rate. This equation is often introduced as a linear approximation to the true real rate of interest, given by the equation $\frac{1 + i}{1 + \pi} = 1 + r$ Let's see how this holds in a discrete time model. Denote your nominal income as $Y$ and the price level as $P$. Your real income is $Y/P$. If all this income is invested in some interest-bearing asset in a discrete time model, your real income in the next time period becomes $\frac{Y (1 + i)}{P (1 + \pi)}$ and if we want to find a real interest rate that summarizes this change in real income, we would need to write your real income in the next time period as $\frac{Y}{P} (1 + r)$ which gives us the identity $\frac{1 + i}{1 + \pi} = 1 + r$ that the Fisher equation approximates. However, if we work in continuous time, this breaks down. First, the units don't work out--inflation rates and interest rates are measured in percentage change per year (or some other unit of time), so they cannot be added to the dimension-less number $1$. Second, it turns out that Fisher's approximation is actually completely correct in continuous time. Using derivatives, we define our quantities as follows: $i = \frac{dY}{dt} \frac{1}{Y}$ $\pi = \frac{dP}{dt} \frac{1}{P}$ $r = \frac{d(Y/P)}{dt} \frac{1}{(Y/P)}$. Using the quotient rule, we can rewrite $r$ as $r = \frac{\frac{dY}{dt}P - \frac{P}{dt}Y}{P^{2}} \frac{1}{(Y/P)}$ which simplifies to $r = (\frac{dY}{dt} \frac{1}{P} - \frac{dP}{dt} \frac{Y}{P^{2}}) \frac{P}{Y} = \frac{dY}{dt} \frac{1}{Y} - \frac{dP}{dt} \frac{1}{P} = i - \pi$ which gives us the Fisher equation, no approximations about it! Note that this assumes continuous compounding from your nominal interest rate. If you instead have a compounding rate of $\tau$, we would define $i$ differently, and our equation becomes $r = \tau \ln(1 + \frac{i}{\tau}) - \pi$. However, for the purposes of the data you're working with, I am 90% sure that this modification is completely superfluous. If you want to use something more precise than the Fisher equation, you need to know exactly how your data was computed. What price index was used to calculate the inflation rate? Under what assumptions was the nominal interest rate calculated? In short, while I can't speak to the reasons for your supervisor's recommendation, they're definitely correct that you should subtract inflation rather than divide by it. There's a reason why we use the Fisher equation. 

Where, in economics, are partial differential equations used? I'm particularly interested in micro theory applications, but would also be keen to know of other applications. 

The answer is most certainly yes. You could compare NE on any criterion that you find relevant. A few examples: You could say that $u_1(U,L) < u_1(D,R)$, or $u_2(U,L) < u_2(D,R)$. You could define $V = \alpha u_1 + (1-\alpha) u_2$ ($\alpha \in [0,1]$) and call it a weighted utilitarian social welfare function. Then obviously $V(U,L)<V(D,R)$ for any $\alpha \in [0,1]$. Obviously in other games, one player might prefer one NE and another might prefer another, but not so here. If your question is whether there is a standard way of comparing two NE, I would say that it really all depends on the context. 

This is the beginning of an answer and an attempt to demonstrate how strong the necessary assumptions would have to be to guarantee existence. Let's transform the problem into one that's equivalent but a bit easier to work with. Instead of indexing over families, let's instead index over the agents (members of families). The key to this relabeling is understanding that families can be written as constraints: If agents $i$ and $j$ belong to the same family, then $x_i=x_j$ and $y_i = y_j$. Now we're back in the standard environment with individual agents (not families) but with these familial constraints. Recall the proof of Varian's theorem, which you link in the question. It uses the existence of a competitive equilibrium from equal incomes. In this context, we would need the existence of a competitive equilibrium from equal incomes in which the familial constraints were also met. This is going to be very difficult to do. For instance, consider $i$ and $j$ are in a family, and $$ u_i=x_i + \varepsilon y_i \:\: \text{ and } \:\: u_j = \varepsilon x_j + y_j $$ where $\varepsilon>0$ is tiny. These preferences are monotonic and convex. Basically, one family member cares about $x$ and the other cares about $y$. If each of the two agents is purchasing $x$ and $y$ to maximize his or her utility, you would not expect $x_i^* = x_j^*$ or $y_i^* = y_j^*$ in the competitive equilibrium (see addendum at end). This is why you certainly need some assumption on preference similarities within families (at least to use a version of Varian's proof). My sense is that if you give me any arbitrarily small difference in preferences between family members, I can construct an example around it where there exists no CEEI in which they choose the same allocation. And then, at the very least, you can't use Varian's proof. Two questions: 

USD 2.5m, I would agree with that conditionally. 2m worth of final goods were produced. The workers did not spend the 500k they saved. BUT: you wrote that the suppliers spent the money to produce the car. Depending on the interpretation of the question, the GDP can be different. Since it says explicitly "to produce the cars", those 500k would be intermediate goods that do not enter. There was no consumption. Thus my final answer would be USD 2m (only the cars)! 

The International Fisher Effect (which is not to be confused with the "standard" Fisher Effect that relates differences between nominal and real interest rates to expected inflation) looks at pairs of two countries. So it's not a general statement that higher interest rates always lead to a weaker currency. Your second point describes the more generally observed phenomenon in international economics that higher interest rates might attract investors, thus the demand for the respective currency goes up which leads to an increase in exchange rates. How - or if - the two effects interact depends on which country pairs you are looking at. 

I'm confused about how one acquires the data necessary to compute price indices--specifically, how one acquires quantity data. Suppose I wanted to compute the Laspeyres Index, defined as $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} p_{i}(t_{f}) q_{i}(t_{0}) / \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} p_{i}(t_{0}) q_{i}(t_{0})$ where $N$ is the number of different goods, each $p_{i}$ is a price, and each $q_{i}$ is a quantity. Each $p_i$ is measured in units of currency per units of a good, and each $q_{i}$ is measured in units of a good per unit of time. But as far as I can tell, we can't measure $q_{i}(t_{o})$ or $q_{i}(t_{f})$. These represent the instantaneous rates that a certain good is sold at a particular time, whereas data-collectors are only able to ask how much firms have sold of a good over a period of time--in other words, we can measure $\int\limits_{t_{0}}^{t_{f}} q_{i}(t)dt$ by summing the total sales of all firms that sell good $i$ during the period between $t_{0}$ and $t_{f}$, but not $q_{i}(t)$ for any given $t$. How do actual econometricians measure $q_{i}(t_{o})$ and $q_{i}(t_{f})$? Do they measure the number of goods sold $x$ days after $t_{0}$ or $t_{f}$, then divide by $x$ for a sort of local approximation? Or do they use some other method? 

The only relation I see is that they are both named after Vilfredo Pareto. The Pareto curve is related to efficiency, and I see no way of connecting the Pareto chart to the same concept. Since Pareto was an engineer before becoming an economist, it seems most likely to me that its just that two distinct techniques from two different fields were named after him. I suppose you could use a Pareto chart as a tool to make efficient engineering decisions, so they are minimally related. 

Set the marginal subsidy equal to the marginal external benefit: $MS(x)=\frac{2700}{x}$. Note that, in this case, the government would end up paying the agent $\sum_{x=1}^{15}\frac{2700}{x} \approx 8959$ in subsidies, which is substantially more than the agent's outlay ($200 \cdot 15 = 3000$). Set the marginal subsidy equal to the marginal external benefit evaluated at the optimal output: $MS(x)=MEB(15)=2700/15=180$. Total subsidy is $180 \cdot 15 = 2700$. Set the marginal subsidy as low as possible to get him to purchase each unit up to 15: $MS(1)=0$. $MS(x) = 200 - \frac{300}{x}$ for $2 \leq x \leq 15$. Total subsidy is $\sum_{x=2}^{15} 200 - 300/x \approx 2105$. I suppose here I could even tax the first unit to bring the total net subsidy down further! 

To understand why some countries are rich and others are not, we need to understand what happened to each of them in the past. How and why they developed depends to a large extent on events that took place decades or even centuries ago. This is what economists broadly refer to as path dependence. Brian Arthur was probably one of the first economists to point that out in the late 1980's. Recently this type of arguing was appreciated again by mainstream economics. There is a growing number of scholarly articles that show how and why some countries developed the way they did. With huge implication for future economic development. Two good summaries are Nunn - The Importance of Economic History for Economic Development and Nunn - Historical Development. So the conclusion would somewhat be like that one can't ignore history if she wants to understand why some countries are poor. And more generally why some things are the way they are (one prominent example was the somewhat random event of why we have a QWERTY keyboard system that is a lot slower than other potential alignments of letters on a keyboard. It was determined once by "luck" let's say, and we never switched back...) So all in all I would argue that knowing (and potentially understanding) some history is essential to understanding how our world works. It's certainly nothing that you can sell as a key feature in your CV (like a specific programming skill), but knowing sufficient history would certainly alter anyone's view of the world. And in order to not repeat huge mistakes that were made in the past (as a "society"), we actually need to know what they were and how and why they came about. 

I'm planning to teach an undergraduate course in industrial organization. Calculus is not a prerequisite. I also want to avoid doing too much game theory in it so as to not be duplicative of a similar course offering in game theory. Any recommendations on textbooks? 

Suppose an agent is choosing how much $x$ to consume and $p_x=200$. If the agent's marginal private benefit is $MPB(x)=300/x$ and $x$ takes only integer values, then he will choose to purchase just one unit of $x$. But suppose his consumption of $x$ yields a positive externality such that the marginal external benefit is $MEB(x)=2700/x$ (essentially there are nine other people similar to the agent who benefit as much from the agent's consumption as the agent does). Then the social optimum is where the marginal social benefit equates with the marginal social cost ($p_x$): $$MSB(x)=MPB(x)+MEB(x)=\frac{3000}{x} = 200 \Longrightarrow x^* = 15$$ If I were to ask what the appropriate Pigouvian subsidy was to implement this societally optimal outcome, I can envisage two possible answers:
