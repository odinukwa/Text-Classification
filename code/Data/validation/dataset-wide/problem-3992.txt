I think I understand the construction for $H^2(M)$ when $H_1(M, \mathbb{Z})=0$ and can make it more explicit than the other answers. As I noted in a comment above, when $H_1(M, \mathbb{Z})$ has torsion, we cannot hope for a canonical construction. When $H_1(M, \mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free but nontrivial, there should be a construction, but I haven't found it. Also, I am terrible with functional analysis and infinite dimensional spaces so I will be vague about what "nice" means. Let $\omega$ be a closed integral $2$-form on $M$. Let $\gamma$ be a closed path in $M$. Since $H_1(M)=0$, there is a surface $S$ with $\partial S = \gamma$. Define $\theta(\gamma) = \exp(2 \pi i \int_S \omega)$. We must check that this is independent of the choice of $S$: If $\partial S_1 = \partial S_2$ then $S_1 - S_2$ is a cycle in $H_2(M, \mathbb{Z})$ so $\int_{S_1-S_2} \omega \in \mathbb{Z}$ and we deduce that $\int_{S_1} \omega \equiv \int_{S_2} \omega \bmod \mathbb{Z}$. Fix a base point $x_0$ in $M$. Let $T$ be the space of all nice paths in $M$ starting at $x_0$. If you fear infinite dimensional spaces more than you hate making choices, choose a metric on $M$, let $T$ be the tangent space to $M$ at $x_0$ and interpret "nice" as "geodesic"; by the Hopf-Rinow theorem, we can identify these with $M$. (I can't decide whether my hatred or my fear is greater.) Let $V$ be the vector space of all nice functions $f:T \to \mathbb{C}$ with the property that, if $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are two paths $x_0 \leadsto x_1$ then $f(\gamma_1) = \theta(\gamma_1-\gamma_2) f(\gamma_2)$. (If $T$ is the tangent space to $M$ at $x$, I think we can take "nice" to be "smooth".) Any path $\gamma$ now gives a linear functional $V \to \mathbb{C}$ by $f \mapsto f(\gamma)$. If $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ both have endpoint $x_1$, then the corresponding linear functionals are proportional. So each $x \in M$ defines a point in $\mathbb{P}(V^{\ast})$. Up to the question of how to put a smooth structure on $\mathbb{P}(V^{\ast})$, we have embedded $M$ into an infinite dimensional projective space. Again, if you fear infinite dimensional spaces more than you hate choices, rather than working with all of $V$, choose a finite dimensional subspace such that, for any $x \in M$, there is some $f \in V$ which is nonzero at $x$. We could try doing something like restricting ourselves to harmonic functions $f$ in the hope of getting a canonical finite dimensional subspace, but then we would get into the question of what the analogue of "ample" is in this setting. I don't know, but maybe some differential geometer does. 

Here is one comment that might help you. In the question session after his talk at the 2008 Michigan workshop, Gross expressed skepticism that his methods could see any information that was not visible on an infinitesimal neighborhood of the singular central fiber which you mention. He did not have a good suggestion for what sort of information might be available in the interior of the moduli space, and not on such an infinitesimal neighborhood. MAJOR DISCLAIMERS: I am not an expert, this was 4 years ago, this was a spoken statement which was probably less carefully formulated than something meant to be recorded in writing. I am, for these reasons, nervous about posting it in public at all. But, if taken with all of these caveats in mind, it might be a good answer to "how far can one get with this program". 

Here is a heuristic argument that there is nothing to explain: The probability that $p$ divides the sum of the preceding primes is $1/p$. So the expected number of primes less than $10^9$ with this property is $\sum_{p \leq 10^9} \frac{1}{p}$. Using Merten's theorem, $$\sum_{p \leq 10^9} \frac{1}{p} \approx \log \log 10^9 + M \approx 3.3$$ Here $\log$ is natural log and $M \approx 0.26149$ is Merten's constant. This is an example of the motto "$\log \log x$ goes to infinity but has never been observed to do so". It is quite common for people to look at primes $p$ which divide some quantity $a_p$ and conclude that they are surprisingly rare when, in fact, they are simply growing as $\log \log N$ for the reason above. 

I don't know the answer, but I am posting to make sure I understand the question and give some partial ideas. As Ben says, the question is hard to follow. I am interpreting it this way: Consider the cone of nilpotent elements in $\mathfrak{so}_{2n}$. How does it break into $SO_{2n}$ orbits under the adjoint action? How is this related to the decomposition according to Jordan normal form? (Note: the decomposition according to Jordan normal form can be thought of as the $SL_{2n}$ orbits for the nilpotent matrices in $\mathfrak{sl}_{2n}$.) 

If $g_1(x)$ and $g_0(x)$ are relatively prime, then there are infinitely many irreducibles of the form $g_1(x) y + g_0(x)$. This is due to Kornblum and Landau (1911) and recorded in many places; see Chapter 4 of Number Theory in Function Fields for a clear modern exposition. For $G(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^n g_i(x) y^i$ for $n>1$, the obvious necessary conditions are that $G(x,y)$ be irreducible as a polynomial in $2$ variables, and that there is no $\pi(x)$ such that $\pi(x) | G(x, f(x))$ for all $f(x) \in k[x]$. In the integer case, these conditions are conjectured to be sufficient. In the function field case, they are not! See Conrad and Conrad and Gross. Their exposition is very clear, and they conjecture what sufficient conditions should be. In a positive direction, Pollack shows that, if you fix $G(x,y)$ in $\mathbb{F}_q[x,y]$ avoiding the obvious obstructions and with $GCD(\deg_y G, q)=1$, fix a degree $n$, and let $y$ range over degree $n$ polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_{q^a}$, then the number of prime values obeys the expected asymptotics (and, in particular, is positive) as $a \to \infty$. I am simplifying his result some for exposition; see the original paper. I don't understand the second part of your question. 

Tate's thesis showed how to profitably analyze $\zeta$ functions of number fields in terms of adelic points on the multiplicative group. In particular, combining Fourier analysis and topology, Tate gave new and cleaner proofs of the finiteness of the class group, Dirichlet's theorem on the rank of the unit group, and the functional equation of the $\zeta$-function. Weil's textbook Basic Number Theory re-presented algebraic number theory from the adelic perspective, showing how adelic methods could provide simple and unified proofs of all the results proved in a first course in algebraic number theory (and perhaps in a second one as well.) I have heard rumors that one can similarly rewrite the theory of elliptic curves in adelic terms, and that doing so gives intuition for the BSD conjecture. Franz Lemmermeyer's paper Conics, a poor man's elliptic curves provides a brief sketch. Is there a survey paper or textbook which lays this picture out in full, as Weil did for the multiplicative group, pointing out the connections between the adelic and the classical language at each step, and ideally discussing the connections with BSD? Note: This question has a peculiar history. See this meta thread if you are interested, but feel free to ignore the past and just answer the question if you are not. 

$\def\PP{\mathbb{P}}$Here is a solution without $-1$ curves. Indeed, my family is semi-stable or, if you want the total space to be smooth, then some fibers are $-2$ curves. My family lives inside $\PP^1 \times \PP^1 \times \PP^1$ with coordinates $(x,y,t)$; the map to $\PP^1$ is projection onto the $t$ coordinate. Start with two $(1,1)$ curves $p(x,t)$ and $q(x,t)$ in the $(x,t)$ variables which meet transversely. For a concrete example, I'll use $xt=2$ and $(3-x)(3-t)=2$ meeting at $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$. Now, inductively, find $t_1$, $x_1$, $t_2$, $x_2$, ..., $t_4$, $x_4$, $t_5$ such that $p(x_i, t_i)=0$ and $q(x_i, t_{i+1})=0$. As a concrete example, we can take $$11/10, 20/11, 17/13, 26/17, 41/25, 50/41, 137/73, 146/137, 521/265$$ Our equation is $$y^2 = p(x,t) q(x,t) \prod_{i=1}^4 (x-x_i).$$ This will be nodal when $t$ is the projection of one of the two intersection points of $p(x,t)=q(x,t)=0$, (in the example, $1$ or $2$) or when $t$ is one of the five $t_i$ (in the example, $11/10$, $17/13$, $41/25$, $137/73$, $521/265$). The five nodal curves of the latter type have two nodes, so their normalization is genus zero; the two nodal curevs of the first type have one node so their normalization is genus one. The total space of this family has $A_1$ singularities at the intersections of the factors of $p(x,t) q(x,t) \prod_{i=1}^4 (x-x_i)$. If you blow them up, they'll turn into $-2$ curves. There are lots of variations of this construction. You could, instead, use a $(2,2)$ curve $r(x,t)$ with a single node, and arrange the four lines $(x-x_i)$ to meet $r(x,t)$ at only four distinct $t$-coordinates. An easy way to do this is to take $r(x,t)$ to use only even power of $x$, and choose $x_2=-x_1$, $x_4=-x_3$. You will then get nodes at these four $t$-coordinates, at the projection of the node of $r(x,t)$, and at the two ramification points of $r(x,t) \to \mathbb{P}^1$. I thought that you could get down to six points by choosing $t_1$ such that $t_1=t_5$ in the first construction, but the only solutions are the degenerate cases $t_1=t_2=t_3=t_4=t_5 = (\mbox{1 or 2 in the example})$. I don't have a strong opinion as to whether six is possible (without $-1$ curves). Indeed, I wouldn't be surprised if there were a solution where we take a double cover of a smooth $(2,6)$ curve $R$ in $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$, chosen such that the degree $6$ projection $R \to \PP^1 \times \PP^1$ has ramification profile $((2,2,2)^6, \ (2,2,1,1))$. I don't know how you'd build such a thing, though. If a cover of $\PP^1$ exists with this ramification profile, then we can prove it by writing down the monodromy in the group $S_6$. But I don't know how to force the resulting curve to be hyperelliptic, so that it will have a second, degree $2$ map, to $\PP^1$. Thinking about parameter counting, being hyperelliptic is a condition of codimension $g-2$, so $3$ for a genus $5$ curve. I have $4$ parameters available in choosing my $7$ branch points down in $\PP^1$. So it seems possible. If we pull this off, there will be no $-2$ curves. 

Once you have used coordinates to check that this connection exists and is unique, you can probably prove anything you want about it faster from this description than from the coordinate formulae. 

I would like to think they would not say this if there were no examples of Gorenstein non-l.c.i. toric singularities. Just to emphasize what everyone else is saying, being l.c.i. is an intrinsic and local condition on a ring. So the natural question is to ask about an affine toric variety, since the question for a projective toric varitey just comes down to checking in every coordinate chart. And l.c.i. implies Gorenstein, which not all toric varieties are, so you at least want to include the condition that your toric variety be Gorenstein. 

It is certainly true that the category of representations of a group $G$ over a field $k$ is equivalent to the category of modules for the group ring $k[G]$, and it is often productive to rephrase questions about representations about questions about modules. Below, I give some examples of structure which is easier to discuss in terms of representations. But, as I will indicate, it is usually possible to rephrase in terms of modules with enough effort. Tensor products: If $V$ and $W$ are two representations of $G$, then $V \otimes W$ has a natural structure as a $G$-representation. For $k[G]$ modules, this is not true; the tensor product has to be added as additional structure on the category $k[G]$-rep. Here is an explicit example: Let $G=\mathbb{Z}/4$ and let $H = \mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/2$. Then $\mathbb{C}[G]$ and $\mathbb{C}[H]$ are isomrphic rings, but the tensor structures on $\mathbb{C}[G]$-modules and $\mathbb{C}[H]$-modules are inequivalent. The same issue exists with duals. People who like rings better than groups would say that the issue is that I am talking about the algebra structure of $k[G]$ when I should be talking about the Hopf algebra structure. Topology: Suppose that $G$ is a topological group (maybe a Lie group) and $k$ a toplogical field (maybe $\mathbb{R}$). Then a continuous representation of $G$ is a map $G \times V \to V$ which is a group action, $k$-linear, and continuous. I imagine there is a way to put a topology on $k[G]$ so that a continuous representation is a $k[G]$-module such that $k[G] \times V \to V$ is continuous, but I haven't seen it. And this will get worse with adjectives like smooth, algebraic, ...
