Answer No (as of 2018-02-07) There is a mongoose Black Diamond Double in 2008 which looks like this, but the pivots are in different places. 

I've bought plenty from dx.com and one thing from alibaba which turned out to be a fake. Generally speaking, its the Britpart mentality. If you want an item whose job is not structural, not safety, and its not required to move, then a "pattern" item would be fine. Good items to buy 

Note this shows the 105 brake calipers which don't reach. I'm also missing the top nut that your bike has around the quill stem. Don't loose that! 

* Heat - try heating the nut up with a butane torch. This will bugger up the temper of metals, so don't play the flame on the dropouts or anything you want to keep. Paint will likely get damaged by this. A yellow-flame lighter won't have the power, you need the tip of the lighter blue flame. Possibly combined with the auto centerpunch to shock things loose. 

Your bike has cantilever brakes, which use a straddle cable and then the main inner cable pulls that. Totally typical brakes for the age of the bike, and perfectly serviceable. However the center cable has to run straight up to a hanger, and its not impossible that some brands of seat may foul this area. Not quite sure what pins your LBS is referring to. The full-sized image clearly shows two lugs for mounting a rack (on either seatstay, just by the brakes.) The photo cuts off at the bottom but you definitely have one lug on the dropout where the mudguard currently mounts. Could be the bike shop was referring to your front derailleur cable, which is the wire going straight down the seat tube. That could interfere with the clamp used in the next image. So depending on your budget a rear mounted seat like this should work. 

I found this bike rack recently, and it works fine for normal bike wheels. However the other side has hooks that face out at about chest height. The hooks are steel but are covered in black plastic tube to stop scratching. The hooks were only about 12-15 cm long, so nowhere near long enough to hold a front wheel. The brick wall is slightly misleading - the whole thing was about the length of a carpark, and it was mounted on 4 beefy caster wheels. There was a handle on the left end to pull the whole rack about, so its a moveable solution. For what could the hooks on the far side be intended? 

They don't come as a set - you need to buy one of each. Its up to you if you want to get cheaper or more expensive parts. The lifespan and weight is what varies with price. Depending on wear, your front chainrings might be getting tired. But I've seen some severely worn ones still working fine. Any 8 speed chain will be fine - you could even mix and match KMC chain with a Shimano cassette. But you need 8 speed chain (possibly labelled as 6/7/8 speed) and you need an 8 speed cassette. If you want to get a bit more adventurous you could look at a 30 or 32 tooth big cog. This would give you a lower-low gear for hillclimbing. Its totally up to you whether this is required. Downside of enlarging the cassette is that your rear derailleur might not fit, or it might chatter on the lowest gear. Chains come in lengths longer than what you need. 114 or 116 links (or half-links) So you shorten them to the same number of links as your old chain. You'll need tools to do this - there are some special bike tools. 

For used parts your best bet is the local ebay or equivalent. Also search in your location for a bike co-operative. In my city there are two. Third option is to buy a complete used bike with the bits you want and then swap parts around. Ideally you'll end up with a second complete bike out of it. Buying new steel forks with a 1" threaded steerer is going to be unlikely but not impossible. Try visiting the oldest, ugliest and most cramped bike shops in your area, and ask nicely. They may have "something out the back" for nice customers. If the shop has room for three people to walk side by side in the aisles, its not a real LBS! 

There might have been another millimetre by fiddling, but not the difference I needed. Please ignore the dodgy-looking cracked tyre sidewalls... they where only for testing. Here's the drop-plate I made from 6mm of scrap aluminium bar. 

Depends if the cage is integral with the rest of the mechanism, or if it can be simply unbolted from both. You would save yourself having to break the chain, release and reattach the gear wire, and possibly reindexing the gears. On the downside, there's a good chance the cages aren't going to just simply swap, so you'd be looking at cutting, filing, drilling, bolting, etc. Adding weight and introducing more failure points If the bolt holes line up precisely then a cage swap might be workable, but otherwise just change the whole mech. Its not a big job, just a comparatively dirty one. 

Mudguards / fenders work by intersecting an imaginary line between your wheel and you/the bike frame. There are two main reasons for having them and they're similar but different. 

There are three major brake cable ends, and two gear cable ends. They are quite separate so that users are less-tempted to use a gear cable where a brake cable is required. 

2 hours is about how long your body has glycogen stores for. So you're bonking because your body has used all the available glycogen. The caffeine will be making fats easier to process instead of glycogen, theoretically leaving you with more "on-tap" at the end of your ride. But you are a scrawny wee twig and lacking in mass, so for you there is less fat available, and the bonk wall will be steep and and immediate, a figurative wall. Your solution is to eat more while riding. Start with a gel every ~30 minutes and see how you feel at the 2 hour mark. Gels are basically easily-digested sugar slop with some flavour. If you don't like gels, then try a square of chocolate. Break it up and freeze it overnight, and store it in a top tube bag or somewhere else not directly on your person. Chocolate is also a significant component of your drink, making it a good substitute that can go with you on the bike. 

Backpacks are a generally poor way of carrying stuff when riding a bicycle. And the bigger the pack, the worse they are. 

Using Sheldon Brown's gear calculator at $URL$ and staying consistent with these values Using a triple of 53/39/30 teeth A 11-28 7-speed cassette will return 9.6-3.8 7.1-2.8 and 5.5-2.1 A 11-28 11-speed cassette returns exactly the same, but with smaller steps. Using a compact double of 50/34 teeth A 11-28 7-speed cassette will return 9.6-3.6 and 6.2-2.4 But technology has moved on and we can now have 11 speed cassettes with 30,32,36,40 and 42 teeth. 8 and 9 speed maximum tooth count is 34 10 speed can come in 34/36/40/42 maximum teeth provided your rear deraileur can handle it. Using a compact double of 50/34 teeth A 11-32 11-speed cassette will return 9.1-3.1 and 6.2-2.1 equal to the triple mentioned above A 11-36 11-speed cassette will return 9.1-2.8 and 6.2-1.9 lower low than the triple A 11-40 11-speed cassette will return 9.1-2.5 and 6.2-1.7 lower low than the triple A 11-42 11-speed cassette will return 9.1-2.4 and 6.2-1.6 lower low than the triple Using a standard of 53/39 teeth A 11-32 11-speed cassette will return 9.6-3.3 and 7.1-2.4 A 11-36 11-speed cassette will return 9.6-2.9 and 7.1-2.2 almost A 11-40 11-speed cassette will return 9.6-2.7 and 7.1-2.0 lower low than the triple A 11-42 11-speed cassette will return 9.6-2.5 and 7.1-1.9 lower low than the triple Note: these numbers are development ratio, so one turn of the cranks results in that many turns of the rear wheel. ANSWER A compact double with an 11-36 rear cassette has a lower-low than the older triples. 

The reason heat didn't help is because the head of the bolt is a long way from the threads, and the heat won't carry that far. Applying heat to the outside of the bike won't really help either. 

Then push the driver down the inside between the rubber and the brake to the pinch bolt. Loosen, adjust, retighten, and finally reclip the rubber to the brake. 

There's a special rivet tool that compresses the fitting while preserving the thread. I have one on order, and it looks like this. 

Your one doesn't look quite the same - it does look like a snapped off line exists though. This was probably a hollow connection pin rather than the solid one supplied with that chain, or perhaps sunrace pins are all hollow. 

Some things to do. If any get you a discount, all good but don't expect it This is based around servicing, rather than buying. 

That is incorrect - Too tight is just as bad as not tight enough. What can go wrong? When its too loose, things slip under pressure, or there's enough slack to allow small amounts of motion, which cause wear. And this can happen when its too tight. 

Alternative to bells and horns is to ride more defensively. Specifically that means anticipating what might happen and proactively reacting, or at least minimising the reaction required to avoid whatever might happen. That means riding out from parked cars by an open door width. Slowing down or speeding up to merge with traffic should there be a pinch point or road works. Anticipating hazards like gravel, potholes,or obscuring water puddles and getting around/over them safely. And directly looking at the face/head of drivers who have to give way to you but might not. The human brain is wired to perceive eyeballs more, so look straight at someone with your whole face is more likely to break through the wall of perception. Dark sunglasses decrease the effectiveness of this. (I wonder if googly eyes on helmet or shirt increase this effect?) Louder horns don't help when modern cars have loud stereos and a lot of sound isolation insulation. 

My understanding is that a car has two systems - the springs (leaf or coils) and the shocks/shock absorbers. Springs absorb the initial impact, but springs alone would be bouncy. So Shocks (should really be called dampers) are systems which resist change and slow down the spring. In your bike's fork, one side is a spring and the other is a damper. They act at different times, and act against each other. Through axles were invented to help tie both fork legs together so this imbalance would be less of an issue. In an ideal world you'd have both on both fork legs, but that would mean smaller springs and dampers, which are less effective even when there are two sets. 

Late answer, but when I was a kid I had a leather satchel as a school bag. This was before backpacks were common. It had a decent leather strap that could be worn across the body, or could be lengthened to do a full square lashing. Hard to describe but the satchel sat on the lower part of the back, and the strap went forward of both shoulders, and then behind the neck. It bounces around if you run, but riding won't do that. Since the bag is aft of your backside it should be more aero than a backpack. The neck strap will help you stay more aero too. 

Upshot is I'm now leery about downhill corners and turning fast in general. My riding has modified so I don't go quite so fast downhill, and I'm an early braker and relatively slow through corners. I have an annual distance goal to meet, logged on strava, and that keeps me going. Next year I will switch that out for a climbing goal of X hundred metres of vertical per month. I don't enjoy climbing and am not very good at it. X remains to be decided. Things, Items, by themselves are not motivations. Instead they're a pit of bad feelings about the cost and lack of use. Every time you see it you feel a little worse, and the bike becomes a ROPA (Ridden Once and Put Away.) My slightly perverse streak is to ride cheap and/or old bikes, and I do a reasonable job of keeping up with the faster chaps on their expensive bikes. 

NOTE just to be clear - tyre clearance matters anywhere that the rotating tyre comes close to your bike frame. So that's 

I'd start with a new chain as a simple maintenance matter - this should have been done when the new rear cog went on anyway. Then compare how your new chain lies around the front chainring compared to the old one. It should mesh fairly well over the whole length of contact, not having phased waves of contact and spaces. Finally, are you positive its the front chainring skipping? Your feet are on the cranks so it can still be the back, and you feel it through the pedals which makes it seem to be the front. Get a friend to ride along side, or try riding on a treadmill or rollers... or even use a gopro and a mount to see what's going on. 

Drum shoes, view from the inside. They're not a great fit with some parts worn smooth and other parts never touched the drum. Activation is incredibly simple-the shorter arm is pulled forward by a brake cable, which rotates the shaft. There are lobes on the shaft that push the brake shoes apart, and against the inside of the drum. When the cable pull drops, the two beefy springs pull the shoes back off the drum. 

I've also carried 100 kilos of UPS hardware for 6 km. That was right on the limit of comfort. However I know the nose weight was around 9 kilos and each tyre carried 43-44 kilos. NOTE This assumes your load is just stuff. If you're hauling live people then absolutely stick to the manufacturer's recommended maximum weights. 

Another option is to not go to drop bars, but to shorten your existing flat bars. Its cheaper, but you won't get the variety of hand positions that a drop bar will give. Its also impossible to revert, once you've cut some off there's no going back. However you can use the existing controls, just shuffled inward a bit. Any gear lever system you get will be either indexed or friction. If its indexed, it has to support the number of cogs on that end of the bike, probably 3 for the front chainring / left hand shifter, and 6 for the rear / right hand shifter. If you chose a friction shifter, then its up to the rider to get the chain into the right place, and then friction holds the lever. Bar end shifters are often friction based. Brifters are always indexed. Please do let us know what you ended up doing. EDIT OJS makes an excellent point - road brake levers for caliper brakes than V-brake or a centerpull brake or a cantilevered brake; they will require more cable pulled than a caliper brake. So you may be fitting rim caliper brakes to your conversion as well. Does the frame have mounting holes straight over the tyre? If you have hydraulic disk brakes, then this is getting really expensive quite quickly. Cable-operated disk brakes may or may not work with road brake levers... the cable pulled to activate them must be the same as the flat-bar brake levers. So my suggestion is - don't. Look for a road bike that is like your requirements, and buy it. The red one in the first image is my bike, which cost $123 NZ. So I have a MTB still for towing the trailer or for wet weather or for biking on anything a little rough. Remember, N+1 is the correct number of bicycles to own.
