look for the stead state formula of $T_t$. You can do this by taking (2.8) and the formula for $T_t$, and combine them. Then, get rid of all $t$ index: 

I am a bit confused, because in a text I'm reading both are used at different times, without mention their direct relation. The answer to me seems to be yes. However, Maybe in special cases like when an homothetic function does not start in the origin, or where Engel lines are horizontal, the relation might break. If so, would these be the only exceptions, such that we could conclude that, for most of our purposes, they are indeed equivalent? 

For future reference, Wikipedia is an unreliable source. If you are in an educational institution, it is likely you have access to the New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics (the terms of trade article is here). If not, you can google "terms of trade pdf" and hopefully get the slides of a generous professor who is sharing his/her knowledge with the world. 

You can also see more about the historical literature on induced technological change here and here. 

From a neoclassical perspective, its function is to allocate scarce resources efficiently, based on the invisible hand that make human selfishness work for the common good. Provided issues like externalities, public goods, etc are taking into account, every factor is paid its marginal product, ensuring efficiency. From a Marxist perspective, its function is to serve the capitalist class by exploiting the workers, who are forced to sell their labour in the market receiving a pay below their actual contribution (because, according to the labour theory of value, only labour produces value). The surplus is appropriated by the capitalists, who enjoy the benefits of the system. In my opinion these highly polar views provide the basis with which other, more complex views can be compared. 

Yet, with the risk of an oncoming economic crisis, and interest rates at record low (probably at the ZLB), what can the Central Bank do? Some say inflation is a good thing, as it "greases the economy" by lowering real wages. But that surely will only hit the demand even more. I'm puzzled! 

You ask about the MP curve. Let start with the IS: $$\tilde{Y}_t = \bar{a} - \bar{b}\left(R_t - \bar{r}\right)$$ Your simplified Taylor rule is: $$R^{CB}_t = \bar{r} + \bar{n}\tilde{Y}_t $$ And the effective real interest rate is: $$R_t = R^{CB}_t + \bar{p} $$ Thus, the MP is: $$R_t = \bar{r} + \bar{p} + \bar{n}\tilde{Y}_t $$ This is upward sloping, because $\bar{n}>0$. (Notice that the investment decision by firms depend on the difference between the effective real interest rate and the marginal product of capital $\bar{r}$. Thus, the MP curve has to be written in terms of $R_t$ and not in terms of $R^{CB}_t$). This result holds even before we mention the nominal interest rate. Since the relationship between real and nominal interest rate is linear and positive, the Taylor rule in terms of the nominal interest rate is also upward slopping. But that is not the MP, and it is not what you seem to be asking. 

I am puzzled. Why transfer payments do not increase GDP? I would have thought that it depends on whether that money is spent. Also, is this completely independent on where that money comes from? What if it comes from borrowing abroad, or nationally, or from taxes? 

Milton Friedman would be absolutely shocked by the title of your question. According to his view, Monetarism, and the Quantitative Theory of Money, inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon... But this relation is positive. The basic equation is: $$ QP = MV $$ where Q is real output, which in the long run is given by technology and factors of production, P is aggregate prices, M is money base or money supply, and V is the velocity of money. Taking V constant (not accurate but simple), and Q as given by real factors, then monetary expansions lead always to inflation. This is the opposite to your initial claim. This story is of course specific to monetarism, and a key foundation of the classical dichotomy. Keynes and Keynesians argue that monetary policy can affect real activity. Regarding your teacher's answer, I think d) is wrong. Consumers and investors care about real interest rate, and not nominal interest rate. As such, GDP should not change. This is consistent with her previous assumption of classical dichotomy in part b). 

Brian's answer surely hit a major part of the issue - the level of the UBI. Yet, there are other aspects of the problem. 

Such calculation is extremely difficult, because all the factors involved in shaping the personal distribution of income: relative change in return to different skills/job (think e.g. on skill-biased technical change), demographical/educational composition change (e.g. many new educated young into the labour market), taxation/redustribution policies (if less poverty, less income support welfare needed?), variations in the functional distribution of income (ownership of financial assets?), etc. It also depends on whether you are measuring inequality at the individual or household level, and which equivalence scale you use in the latter. Not to mention that you need to somehow differentiate between urban and rural sectors to incorporate your change. I can think of three options you can follow to get what you want: 

(source here) Regarding the personal income distribution, it is well known that capital income is more unequally distributed than labour income. Therefore, a shift in the distribution of factor income towards capital is to increase inequality at the individual and household level (due to positive assortative mating). Whether this is intrinsic to capitalism or not it's not self-evident, I would say. Finally, from factor income and personal income to wealth inequality there is a long way. Evidence also indicates that wealth inequality is more unequally distributed than income, and a simple capitalisation approach would prove this. But again, even if it is true that wealth inequality has worsen in the last years, given that the premises by which you started are empirically false. If capitalism is the culprit here, it is for other reasons. If you want to argue that high inequality is intrinsic to Capitalism (like Piketty, 2014 does), there are other arguments (e.g. power, taxation, reserve army of labour, technological change). Yo do not need the one you are mentioning, which seems to be at odd with the evidence. 

It depends. Some countries use hourly wage (Australia, Morocco, UK, US), other use daily (Mexico), other monthly (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Peru, Spain), others annually (Bolivia). (this is not an exhaustive list) Countries without a minimum wage established by law are: Denmark, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland. They do however have minimum wages negotiated at the trade union level, even at industry level. Given this information, the "traditionally" adjective you are using is not very helpful. 

Think of robots increasing the productivity of capital by much more than that of workers. If consumers are happy to rebalance their consumption bundles toward more robot-produced goods and away from labour-intensive goods, then the wage rate will fall, affecting workers. 

Then, an important issue is product choice. Comparability depends on products being relatively homogeneous in both countries, so that table above can be filled in completely. This requires an adjustment for product quality when necessary (e.g. mobile phones), part of which is adjusted using hedonic regression (see page 15+ of Chapter 4). Additionally, products must be representative on each country, simply defined as (see point 7 in Chapter 11 for a technical definition): 

On top of this, I think using the ratio of two log prices is also quite counterintuitive. Notice that the following equality is true: $$ \frac{\ln P_{it}}{\ln P_{jt}} = \log_{P_{jt}}P_{it} $$ Thus, by defining your log RPI as the ratio of two logs, you actually have a (non-natural) logarithm, where one price index is used as a base. Even more, this base is changing over time. This is not the case when you use the log of a ratio, as both have a common base (normally, $e$). 

Section 2 of that paper explores some examples of uncomputability in economic theory. This author is one of the leading figures in the field called "Computable Economics", which is an attempt to produce Turing Complete economic theory. In 2000 he compiled a book on the subject. There is also a 2009 handbook of Computable Economics. The 2000's book opens with a quote that hints why Game Theory is not Turing Complete: 

The main (and only) result of interest is shown in "Tabla 1". It indicates the increase in final prices for different industries. Remarkable are the cases of Manufacturing ("Industrias Manufactureras", Ṇ̣o 5), with 8.2%, Energy (No 3) with 4.88% and Transport (No 7), with 4.3%. Housing (No 10) and "Corporative services?" (No 12) are the least affected (0.5%). Regarding the methodology, it is based on a price model of the Social Accountability Matrix. To me, it does not seem like a very through exercise, and it is not based on a behavioural, general equilibrium approach, but more of an accounting exercise. Still, it seems to be the only study available at the moment.. 

I will attempt to answer the first (How prevalent is it?) and last question (Where can I see their work?). There was a recent post in The Economist about the emergence of machine learning into standard economic papers. They produced a nice graph, reproduced below: 

Part A: how much does the UK contributes to the EU Budget This depends on whether you use fiscal year or calendar year estimates. The figures for the 2015/2016 fiscal year are here. The key is the following graph: 

In any case, although I don't have the list at hand, I am very sure it does not include Argentina. The key here is that if the selection of countries were different, and more similar to the countries like Argentina, the poverty line would reflect more of the Argentinian reality. Notice however that the calculation of this line already was converted using PPP levels. This means you cannot simply translate US\$ 3.10 and US\$ 90.30 into Argentinian pesos using market exchange rates (of 2011). You need to revert back to pesos using the PPP rate. Unfortunately, the 2011 edition is not available for Argentina. The 2005 edition is 1.2. For a poverty line in 2005 of US\$ 1.25, and monthly of US\$ 37.5, this corresponds to $37.5*1.2=45$ pesos per month. You might agree that this, in 2005, is nonsensical, as the minimum wage per month was 550 pesos. (For comparison, the Chilean monthly povert line according to the World Bank was 30,000 CLP, whereas the minimum wage was roughly 130,000 CLP). No surprise then that the poverty rate in Argentina was, according to the World Bank, so low. For a very recent study of global poverty using alternative definitions, coauthored by Martin Ravallion (one of the actual proponents of the poverty line statistic), see here. 

(Source here). How these developments are related to Trump is not clear though. Some news reports about these data releases make no mention of a Trump effect (e.g. here (Q4 2017), here or here (Q1 2017)). Another example comes from the stock market. Here is an analysis showing the performance of the stock market under different presidents, after their 100th days in office. I show the main table below: 

which is an ordered set. However, because both the utility function and the cost function are quadratic, it results that 

A related question in this site focuses on the definition of poverty lines by the World Bank. Basically, the WB poverty line is based on national poverty lines, which usually cover minimum nutritional, clothing, and shelter. They do not include other things which other people might consider important, including transport. For instance, I would argue that transport costs is very important too, as it is common in Latin American massive cities for the poor to live segregated, far from core commerce and industrial centres. Additionally, the WB poverty line is based only in a selection of countries. As such, it is not expected to be representative of all nations. For example, as the official WB FAQ states regarding the 1990 poverty line:
