In terms of the numbers involved, it does seem a bit of a stretch to extrapolate from the remains of 124 individuals to: 

Exactly who the Antiu were has long been a matter of academic debate. Some have argued that the "Anu" or "Antiu" were the pre-dynastic people of Upper Egypt. Others suggest that they were a nomadic people from the Sinai Peninsula. If they were the former, they would eventually be absorbed into Egypt when the kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt were unified. It seems likely that the Antiu were one of the traditional Egyptian enemies known collectively "Nine Bows". In the pre-dynastic period the Nine Bows does seem to have referred to "native" enemies rather than foreigners. However, from the perspective of the people living in the fertile Nile delta ("Lower Egypt"), the inhabitants of both Upper Egypt and the Sinai might be considered as "desert-dwelling native enemies". As far as we know, the Antiu didn't leave any records of their own, so we have to rely on Egyptian sources, which generally just show Egyptian rulers smiting these "enemies of Egypt", (all in accordance with Maat). As a result, we know almost nothing about their society, but Oldcat is very probably right when he suggests in the comments above that nomad groups like the Antiu were likely to have had a "trade or raid" relationship with a settled society like that of the Nile delta in pre-dynastic Egypt. 

There are some interesting resources, including records and photographs, available on the web site U-boat Archive. 

So the seat of government, and therefore the capital city, moved from New York to Philadelphia from 1790 until 1800 while the new seat of government at Washington DC was being built. So, yes, New York was the seat of government, and so the capital city, from 1789 to 1790; Philadelphia was then the capital city from 1790 to 1800; Washington DC has been the capital city since then. 

So, why would Nero order some executions by suicide? From Nero's viewpoint, the suicides offered several benefits: 

Many businesses that were owned by foreign nationals found it necessary to make that fact clear to avoid being targeted. Images like the one below are all-too-common from that time: 

Of course, as if all that wasn't complicated enough, all these periods can be subdivided into further archaeological periods. What is more the dates for each period are not always universally agreed. As another example, these definitions are used for the archaeomagnetic dating database being developed by Bradford University. 

The first Inquisition was temporarily established in Languedoc (south of France) in 1184 by the Papal Bull Ad abolendam. This would lead directly to the Albigensian Crusade, which lasted from 1209 to 1244 and resulted in at least 200,000 Cathar deaths, and probably many more. The Inquisition was permanently established in 1229, and run largely by the Dominican order until its abolition in the early 19th century (although part of the institution survived as part of the Roman Curia, and is known today as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith). 

I haven't been able to find online copies of most of the relevant memos, but they are quoted in Barton J. Bernstein's Eclipsed by Hiroshima and Nagasaki: Early Thinking About Tactical Nuclear Weapons. 

The Bronze Age in Britain dates from about 2500 BC to about 800 BC. Burials in barrows with a burial mound are, perhaps, the defining feature of Bronze Age funerary practice in Britain. It seems the change in burial practice accompanied the introduction of bronze-metalworking technology (perhaps literally in the case of the Amesbury Archer). One major problem problem is that there just aren't enough barrows to account for the whole population. If "high-status" individuals were buried in barrows, what happened to everybody else? Perhaps excarnation continued to be practised (this might be a possible function for those henge sites). We know that there was "ritual" (yes, there's that word again) deposition of metalwork in water at Bronze Age sites like Flag Fen. It is possible that remains were gathered after excarnation and also deposited in rivers. We also have increasing evidence of cremation, particularly in the later Bronze Age, with the remains buried in pits (often around existing barrows). Perhaps the remaining population were also cremated and their ashes then scattered. The truth is that we really just don't know what happened to the bulk of the population of Bronze Age Britain when they died. As mentioned above, stone circles continued to be erected into the Bronze Age. At other sites, like Stonehenge, the arrangement of the stone circle changed over time. This has been extensively studied. We have a very clear idea about what happened, and when, but we can only guess when it comes to the question of why? One unique monument from the early Bronze Age in Britain is Silbury Hill. This is the largest man-made mound in Europe. We have no idea of its function, but a series of excavations appear to show that there was never a burial beneath it. 

Cavalry were certainly used during the First World War. It is worth remembering that the First World War was a world war, and wasn't limited to the attritional trench warfare of the Western Front, which is often the first image that people call to mind when they think of that war. 

One of the sources quoted by the Wikipedia article is the United Nations Report of the Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary. If the document is genuine*, I would be inclined to give it much more credence than an unsourced sentence in an introductory paragraph to a Wikipedia article. On page 150, the report states that, on the evening of 23 October: 

Misr is the Arabic name for Egypt, and so it's use by Egyptians as the name for Egypt probably dates to the Arab conquest of Egypt in the mid 7th century (~640AD). There are several theories for the origin of Misr as the Arabic name for Egypt. 

The flag is actually supposed to show the island's links with Cuba, rather than the US. Consider the Cuban flag: 

EDIT: This gilded example (which was actually 57mm in diameter) sold for 25,000 Hungarian Florint (about £7.00 GB at current exchange rates) in 2013. 

The crime reported in the newspapers as "f. and a." was "Fornication and Adultery", as in this case from 1922: 

There is nothing to say whether the fort was one captured before the siege, or built by the Egyptians themselves as part of their siege-works. Personally, I suspect the latter, but once again, the texts are not explicit. In your comment to my last answer, you mentioned a thick wall described in the texts. In fact, there is an entire line missing between the mention of the fort quoted above and the description of the wall. That description is itself damaged, but it seems that the Egyptians named the wall "mn-xpr-ra iH sTtyw tA" ("Menkheperre-enclosing-the Asiatics" - Menkheperre being Thutmose III's prenomen). If this is correct, (as I say, the text is damaged, but this is how I would read it) it seems more likely in this context that the "thick wall" was the one surrounding Megiddo, rather than a reference to the walls of the fort. 

If you are interested in further research into the subject of DNA "haplogroups", including some of the limitations in drawing conclusions from the data, there are a number of good websites available. As is so often the case, Google is your friend here, but two good starting points are Wikipedia and the International Society of Genetic Genealogy Wiki. 

The image is a modern reproduction of a carved image of Ramesses II from the Abu Simbel temples at Aswan. Steve is correct in his comment. The rear-facing case was a quiver for arrows, and the forward-facing one was a case designed to hold a bow. Very few chariots survive from ancient Egypt and until recently what these cases were made from, and how they were constructed was largely a matter for conjecture. We now know that they would have been made from leather. The leather trappings and harness for an ancient Egyptian chariot were identified in an archive at the Cairo museum back in 2011. The collection includes the quiver and bow-case. They featured in a 2013 NOVA/PBS documentary Building Pharaoh's Chariot. Details from the examination of the leather trappings and harness have actually provided key insights into ancient Egyptian chariot building, and will be the focus of a new publication Chariots of Ancient Egypt, expected later this year. (Although, having seen the price tag, I'll be reading it at the library rather than buying a copy for myself!) 

I suspect that the podcast may be referring to published research by Robert Allen of Oxford University. In his 2006 paper Explaining The British Industrial Revolution From the Perspective of Global Wage and Price History. Professor Allen observes: 

So, while in general the Nuremberg Laws did not split up existing marriages between Jews and non-Jews, they did include the provision enabling the Public Prosecutor to do so.

Free peasants The distinction between freemen and sokemen is subtle, and the usage may actually have varied in different parts of the country. In addition, regional differences in how the information was recorded in Domesday Book means that our understanding of those terms may be less than perfect. However, with that caveat, the UK National Archives offers the following definitions for the terms 'freemen' and 'sokemen' as used in the Domesday Book: Freeman 

So, to answer the question. "Why is King Richard I "Coeur de Lion" considered to be a good king, and King John a bad one?" By the standards of the day, Richard actually was a good king, or at least he was considered to be one by most of his contemporaries. By those same standards, King John actually was a really, really bad king. Modern historians take a wider view. While few would argue that Richard was a "good king" by any objective standard, most would certainly agree that he was much better than John. (And yes, I managed to answer the question in less than a book. Just.) 

Unfortunately, the Italian Wikipedia page doesn't cite a source for its claim. I'm certainly not aware of any securely-dated thimbles from Roman contexts here in the UK. I did a keyword search on reports of small finds from Pompeii and Herculaneum, but couldn't find any mention of thimbles there either. 

The claim has certainly been made on a number of occasions. In an article titled Chained to scourge of slavery in the Sydney Morning Herald (dated 6 December 2012), the Australian journalist, Elizabeth Farrelly, observed: 

Perhaps surprisingly, this episode may actually be based events that are reported to have occurred in 1531. In The life of Anne Boleyn by Philip W Sergeant, published in 1923, we read that: 

It doesn't seem so. Earlier Egyptian temples in Nubia, for example the temple of Wadi al-Sabua, had been located within what appear to be fortified enclosures. That does not appear to be the case with the Abu Simbel temples. This, in turn, suggests that by the time these temples were being built, they were considered to be safely within "Egyptian" territory, and did not require fortification. 

For the purpose of definition, the capital city of a country is generally taken to be its seat of government. The United States Congress was established following the ratification of the United States Constitution, so one might argue that the "United States" came into existence at that point. The first session of the United States Congress ("First Congress") formally began on 4 March 1789. 

In terms of famine relief, Churchill initially urged Australia to provide assistance. In response, Australia promised to supply 350,000 tons of wheat. The Canadian Prime Minister, MacKenzie King, also offered to provide aid, but Churchill replied that: “Wheat from Canada would take at least two months to reach India whereas it could be carried from Australia in 3 to 4 weeks.” Winston S. Churchill to William Lyon Mackenzie King, 4 November 1943. 

I've been asking around the people I know who have studied Egyptology, and I think that landofpyramids.org have got it wrong on their Crowns of Egypt page. The Modius is a type of flat-topped cylindrical headdress. It is used in art from the ancient Egyptian and Greco-Roman worlds. An example can be seen in this bust of Serapis. The term "Modius" is actually just one given by modern scholars based on its resemblance to the jar used as a Roman unit of dry measure. That being the case, it seems that the term would be quite inappropriate for Nefertiti's crown. As far as I can see, the term most-commonly used in the literature for Nefertiti's headdress (on this statue and in other artworks of the Amarna period) is simply "flat-topped crown", for example in this article titled Nefertiti's Regality, or this one describing a Dyad of Akhenaten and Nefertiti from Tell El-Amarna. 

The implication being that rings were traditionally worn on the left hand (at least by men). He then reinforces the impression that rings were worn on the left hand when he says: 

I think that was on the Isonzo Front during the First, rather than the Second World War. There were actually 12 Battles of the Isonzo between the armies of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Italian army. These were fought between May 1915 and October 1917, and were every bit as brutal as those fought on the Western Front. Both sides used artillery in these battles. In fact, artillery was said to have been decisive in the Seventh Battle of the Isonzo. In the early stages it was mostly light, 75mm guns, but medium and heavy guns began to be introduced to the theatre from 1916. Some images in this picture gallery show artillery on these fronts. A couple of the pictures show artillery pieces being moved - pulled by horses and manpower. 

A different perspective on the history of the Inquisition can be seen in this article in the Catholic Encyclopedia. 

The existing answers provide an excellent background to the political situation in the nineteenth century. I will try to answer the specific points raised in the question. 

The question of vowel sounds in the ancient Egyptian language is an interesting one. For example, most popular books about Egyptian hieroglyphs will confidently tell you that the vulture: 

Unfortunately, none of the dates for these four eclipses fits all the other details of the story perfectly, particularly if the "fast" mentioned by Josephus is taken to be Yom Kippur. As far as I am aware, most historians still accept the conventional date of 4BC. If the the fast mentioned by Josephus wasn't Yom Kippur, but actually the Fast of Esther, which occurs exactly one month before Passover, then an eclipse on March 12-13 in 4BC actually matches with Josephus details is quite well. This point is made by Suzanne Nadaf in the Queries & Comments of Bible Archaeology Review, Vol 40, issue 3 (May/June 2014). For those who want to accept the tradition that "the Messiah was born in 3 B.C.", based on the calculations of the 6th-century monk, Dionysius Exiguus, the possibility of Herod's death occurring in 1 BC is clearly very attractive. The truth is, as John A. Cramer concedes (in the reply to Suzanne Nadaf's post, cited above), there are just too many possibilities and we have too little hard information to determine the precise date. The question will almost certainly remain open forever. 

What we do know is that the excavations have produced remains from at least 124 individuals. The bones are almost entirely dis-articulated and are scattered along a stretch of the River Tollense more than 2.5km in length. The excavation team have suggested that: 

As Mark has noted above, Bligh was denied charts when he was set adrift by Fletcher Christian and the other mutineers. He was, however allowed to take a copy of John Hamilton Moore’s Practical Navigator in addition to the sextant that Mark mentioned. Bligh knew his initial position and his (approximate) destination. With the sextant and Hamilton-Moore's Practical Navigator, he was able to make latitude observations and so navigate by dead reckoning. He also had a disciplined crew on his boat and he had luck on his side. Bligh's sextant, and other items from that remarkable voyage are held in the collections of the National Maritime Museum in London. 

You can request a "Page Check" which will determine if the document is suitable for copying and, if so, how much they will charge to copy it. If it is deemed suitable by the archivists, you can pay your fees and they will send you a copy of the file. The current cost of a page check is £8.40 (GB). [Costs are set by the UK government] You can employ a researcher to visit the National Archives on your behalf. 

For that reason, I suspect that this example is actually from a modern set of Chinese "copies" based on the early patterns produced in 1854 and 1855. [Sets of these copies are pretty inexpensive online on sites like AliExpress.
