As an addendum, when you talk about "life" and "spirituality", perhaps you're talking about what's translated from the suttas as "holy life" -- perhaps that's brahmacariya -- and features in suttas like this one -- or in this formula. However that may give the impression that Buddhism is only for monks, which isn't the whole truth. 

I won't say that all relationships must end; but if a relationship doesn't end, one of the partners will die. When we knew that my partner was dying, I think then we both/each experienced more love and less attachment than we had previously. 

At the bottom of the page it says its translation is based on work by Daw Mya Tin and documents on the DLMB web site. So, here (on the DLMB web site) is a detailed analysis of the Pali. It ends with a commentary which says, 

Not a very Buddhist answer. Anyway I suppose that's the cause: it may be comparable in its (physiological and possibly/consequently attachment-inducing or habit-forming) effect to recreational drug use. Skill (in hunting) may require a person to avoid or overcome (or deny or control or dissipate) that effect (because it can be debilitating): I'd guess the physiological reaction/effect is more evolutionarily helpful for gross motor activities (running and fighting) than for fine motor activities (aiming and shooting). Wisdom is something else, presumably, i.e. seeing it for what it is. 

Piya Tan has an essay on the topic here: Is Rebirth Immediate? (SD 2.17) And a commentary and translation of the sutta here, Kutūhala,sālā Sutta, which includes "To Vaccha’s second and final question, the Buddha makes his famous statement on the intermediate state." My paraphrase of the essay (if I've read it correctly) is that: 

Do you think someone might have asked that question before? According to Access to Insight, many of the suttas include the following quote, 

Someone (I forget who -- Paul Carus perhaps) drew an analogy with Christianity -- saying that Buddhism is a reformation of Brahmanism, like Christianity is a reformation of Judaism. In my opinion, the doctrines might seem similar superficially, in that they inevitably have some words in common -- a common language or vocabulary, the vernacular. If Christianity and Judaism both use the word "God", here you say that Buddhism and Hinduism both use the word "mind". I don't understand that to mean that it's "copied" though. If I paint an original picture, and you paint an original picture, and we both use the same paints -- we're both using the same paints (the same words) to create our pictures, but that doesn't mean that we're copying each other's pictures. dyana (meditation) Forms of meditation were practised in China too at about that period -- without I think being copied from Hinduism. I don't assume it (meditation) is specifically "Hindu" rather than "human". Sakyamuni did study under other contemporary teachers, before he attained enlightenment -- he found their teachings insufficient, though. dharma became dhamma It's a very general word, meaning something like "doctrine" or "reality" or "the way things are". Every doctrine has (or is) dhamma, by the definition of the word, that doesn't mean they're copied from each other. ideas of reincarnation I'm not really familiar with Hindu ideas of reincarnation, I think the ideas might be dissimilar though. I presume that the Buddhist doctrine of anatta (the non-existence of a permanent self) makes it unlike the Hindu idea. daya (compassion) Again, IMO this (Compassion) is a human theme: not specifically Hindu or copied from Hinduism. How much did Sakyamuni reinterpreted on Brahmanism and how much is disinformed? There are many suttas in which the Buddha interacts with (talks with) Brahmins -- sometimes to criticise their behaviour, or to explain why and how his (Buddhist) dhamma is different from theirs (early Hinduism). I think it's truer to say that it's "reinterpreted" rather than "copied". Even so that reinterpretation (i.e. contrasting Buddhism with Hinduism) may occur especially when talking with Brahmins. There's a Wikipedia article Buddhism and Hinduism -- I think it's an OK article, not brilliant -- at a minimum it begins to illustrate how many similarities there are, and how many differences: more than it's easy to answer fully, here. 

The next paragraphs explain why that "does not conflict with what is said in the texts": maybe that's evidence that this formula, i.e. starting with the first person singular, isn't found in the (earlier) suttas. 

I guess that's a selfish and self-serving view: which you should hesitate to ascribe to the Buddha as a motive. Another motive might be conceit (e.g. "I'm more enlightened than you") but we're told that the Buddha is beyond that too. I assume instead that it may be motivated some kind of kindness or generosity. Or it may be some kind of virtue -- virtuous behaviour. I think there's a sutta where the Buddha says, something like (I don't remember it well), that a person should venerate their teacher ... that being somehow subservient or obedient (to the teacher) is essential ... and that the Buddha himself, with no teacher of his own, said that he would obey the Dhamma as his own teacher. I think that even the precepts, i.e. "don't kill" and so on, are based on empathy/morality/virtue. Also though "unselfish empathy" may be a heavenly attitude, it's only one of them -- there's also "taking pleasure in another's virtue" (which might be another reason perhaps for the buddha's encouraging others' enlightenment), as well as equanimity (see "brahmaviharas" for more detail). Another answer is that there are people who do as you suggest, i.e. attain enlightenment but without being willing or able to teach; these people might be known as "arhats" or "private Buddhas" -- so (trivially) the Buddha tries to help by definition, i.e. if he didn't try to help he wouldn't be a Buddha, it's his trying to help that makes him a Buddha. 

I have a problem whereby because I am thinking about my breathing my breath is quite short "Where" are you think about your breathing: is your focus somewhere around your nose? An alternative might be to focus somewhere lower: e.g. on your diaphragm; or lower (e.g., according to the Chinese, "The Lower Dantian (Jing), located two inches below the navel, is the source of energy which builds the physical body"). Or even lower: my Tai Chi teacher once said to imagine breathing through your heels! In Anapanasati -- Unveiling the Secrets of Life by Bikkhu Buddhadasa, it recommends you shift your point of awareness (in Appendix D in the section titled "Getting Started: Establishing Sati"): 

Some personal counsellors ask questions, along the lines of, "And how do you feel about that?" Maybe that's similar to Vipasanna's asking people to note their feelings. Maybe that turns people's attention inward (not "my partner is wrong" but "I'm feeling ignored" or "confused and angry about my inability to make my partner behave the way I want them to") which might be essential to helping them to act, "rationally" or sanely. Maybe asking 'leading' questions is an acceptable way to steer the conversation. By analogy with a medical doctor they could be 'informed' questions (i.e. informed by your prior knowledge), but still I suppose they ought to be questions (I read a science fiction story once in which a society had a jury system where the jury members were expected to be "biased" but not allowed to be "prejudiced"). Beware that I'm not "a so-called professional", but your professional page (which you linked to) says, 

I don't think that is Buddhist doctrine. I think that Buddhist doctrine is that we tend to view matter inappropriately or with ignorance. 

That type of thinking seems to me like vicious circle and an addiction (harmful, repeated endlessly, seems like it ought to be behaviour people are free to choose to abandon however some people don't seem able to abandon it): however I don't understand what the pleasure in it is if any. Maybe the so-called pleasure in this case is that people (including young children) like to get at least an equal share of something, like to see social justice, so people are wired to take pleasure in righteousness or self-righteousness, or to seek justice (selfish justice, justice for themselves) as a type of satisfaction. 

For a start, there's the parable of the blind men and the elephant. Access To Insight describes this as
