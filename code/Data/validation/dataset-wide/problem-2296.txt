I mark all my stuff with an engraver. All my Nalgenes have my name engraved right on the front under the Nalgene logo. You could engrave whatever you want on the front then do marker over top. The marker may rub off the smooth plastic, but not so much out of the engraving. Even if all the ink washes away, the engraving is still there.

If you think about it, lighting a kerosene lamp with a flint and steel is essentially the same as lighting a Zippo Lighter. The classic of classic lighters has a flammable-fluid soaked wick that is ignited by a small flint and steel. The only significant difference is that Kerosene has a slightly higher flashpoint than Lighter Fluid (Naphtha). 

When you put your sights on an animal at a significant distance, you want to aim just behind their leg, mid way through their body-this is where their lungs are. Real animals don't have targets drawn on them, so you have to know their anatomy and where their vital organs sit in their chest cavity. Here's where you have to use your imagination, because in reality all animals are just brown blobs, and you're lucky if you can get within 40 yards of them most of the time. When you sight up on your animal, this is what should be picturing in your head: 

I'm partial to the taut-line hitch, but you could also use a rolling hitch. I like using adjustable knots because they're easier to get tight, quick to re-tighten if they come loose for any reason, and easy to loose and untie. Simply tie the taut-line hitch back onto the same line after feeding it through the loop, you can then slide the knot along the rope as you tighten the trucker knot (or butterfly pulley as I've always called it), then tie the slack off around the whole system using slip-overhand knots. 

The answer to this question depends a lot on your skill level. You say you want a ski that does a little bit of everything, so I'd recommend a ski with both camber and rocker, but you're going to have to balance length and width based on how you ski. The shorter ski you get, the more control you're going to have on the downhill, but you're going to have to go wider to get the float you need to support 90kg plus a backpack (you need to factor in the weight of your gear and backpack when shopping for backcountry skis). I'm 188cm, but not even 75kg, and I ride skis 210cm long. They are amazing for staying afloat in deep snow, and climbing steep slopes with full skins, but I'm not as strong a skier as I used to be, so I struggle a bit on the downhill in the glades trying to dodge trees. My next pair will probably be 170cm at the longest for tight turning (and slightly slower descents) with a little more rocker because I tend to stay in deep snow. I probably won't enjoy the uphills as much, but if I get a wider ski I should still be able to float fairly well. If you're really not sure what kind of ski to get, then go for the best deal, riding your skis is really the only way to learn what kind of ski you really want or need, but if in doubt, just pick something whics seems to be a balance of everything (rocker, camber, radius, width), and use them for a season, from there you'll be able to discover what type of skier you are and what type of ski you'd need. 

It may be safe for you, but not for your jacket. While it won't instantly burst into flames, your very expensive jacket will get holes melted in it by hanging around a fire, same goes for any other nylons or non fire-resistant synthetic materials. Goose down will burn fairly well, oddly enough there are quite a few youtube videos of people burning down jackets. There is a certain romance associated with having a fire, but it will leave you smelling smokey–necessitating extra washings of your delicate gear–and it will damage your technical clothing if a spark or ember lands on you. I used to wear my nice outer layers around campfires until it dawned on me that most of the stuff I have was designed for alpinism, which takes you up above the tree line into areas where there isn't anything to burn. They aren't meant to be worn around a campfire. In fact it's very ineffective to wear a down jacket around a fire because it will actually insulate you against the heat it radiates. Zipping up your jacket and sipping on some hot apple cider, or hot soup will warm you infinitely faster than sitting by the fire will. Campfire clothes are the heavy wool jackets, and flannel shirts worn by mountain men, hunters and lumberjacks. I have a wool jacket from nepal that I use as my sit around the fire jacket. Lots of people around here bring their hippie hoodies (aka baja jackets) when they go camping or hang out around a campfire. In scouts, everyone wore their wool scouting blankets like ponchos. First-aid responders will tell you that synthetic materials are actually one of the worst things to have on when working with a fire, because they will melt to your skin if they do catch. There are flame-resistant synthetic materials, Scouts Canada stopped selling wool scout blankets because there had been incidents with boy scouts sitting too close to the fire and setting their blanket aflame, so they started making their blankets out of a flame resistant polyester that feels like thick wool. 

Two ways to get started on a hike: with either your right foot, or your left foot :P First and foremost you need comfortable footwear. Doesn't matter what it is to get started, I've led people over mountain ranges and all they wore were cross trainers. When you get more serious into it, then you should determine what type of trails you want to hike on and buy an appropriate pair of boots, hikers, or trail runners for the terrain you're going to be trekking over. If you're going to be hiking on uneven ground or carrying a heavy backpack, get something with good ankle support, if you're going to be hiking on muddy/wet trails, get something that's also waterproof, if you're hiking somewhere hot get something that breathes well, if you're going to be walking on smooth, flat, well maintained trails, just get a pair of comfy trail runners will likely be more than adequate. Don't go out and get the most intense pair of boots you can, it's vital that you get the appropriate boot. I have many pairs of boots, and I pick and choose which one I'm going to wear depending on the hike. After boots, when you feel like you want to upgrade and get some more creature comfort hiking accessories, you should look at investing in breathable technical clothing, a water bladder, trekking poles (poles make a huge difference on your legs in the long trails or steep climbs, and save your knees on the descents), and gradually get larger and larger backpacks as you find your going out on longer and longer hikes. To get fit, just hike often, walk lots, take the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator, and just get up and move around more often. Any kind of activity will prepare you for getting into hiking. 

You're really only limited by your imagination, there are hundreds of things you could use 10' of strong cord for. 

The picture does't show it, but you're supposed to use velcro straps or something else as a safety to prevent the rope from jumping the track. EDIT: If you're concerned about your edge protector flipping over, they do make Roll modules for moving ropes that have both vertical and horizontal rollers:
