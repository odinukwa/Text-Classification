I think what your professor meant by saying; "The difference between math and physics is that physics describes our universe, while math describes any potential universe" is that the study of Pure Mathematics provides a deeper and more substantial understanding of reality than physics. Im guessing that your Professor is in some sense a Platonist, as Philosophy of Mathematics is grounded in Plato's theory of the forms. Mathematics and Physics present two distinctively different ways to understand reality, and the distinction is in the different approaches to discerning what reality is in essence by discerning what it is ultimately reducible to. The Physicist will tell you its matter all the way down, that reality in essence is matter, and that all matter is ultimately reducible to a particle which is indivisible; the materialist approach. Physics will give you technical expertise, but tell you little about what reality is in essence as materialism is an assumption. The mathematician will generally describe reality in terms of the forms, that reality is ultimately reducible to principles of logic, the idealist approach. Pure Mathematics will give you a deep understanding of the nature of reality and technical expertise. I believe this distinction between the different intellectual fruits of labour for both fields was at the core of your professors arguement. 

Miyamoto Musashi's book of five rings, D.T Suzuki's: An Introduction to Zen Buddhism, and Yamamoto Tsunetomo's Hagakure are all excellent work, and there are many more excellent japanese works but these are my favourite. They all explore the idea of performing under a looming threat of death, and give strategies for overcoming fear. 

This question is a paradox, simply because the thinking is in contrasting terms. Logically one cannot conceive of "something" without framing it in a contradictive contrast to "nothing" and vice versa. The key to solving this is obviously in framing it in a way that it doesnt contradict itself. The uncertainty principle tells us that everything simultaneously exists/doesnt exist until observed, which also applies to the observer simultaneously existing/not existing until observed. This would imply that both statements of "somethingness" and "nothingness" are simultaneously and equally true. The problem again is that this is paradoxical, human reason demands that it must be either one (something), the other (nothing) or neither, but definitely and necessarily not both. So, "How could our universe suddenly appear out of nothingness?". Logically it never could have, "universe" appearing out of "nothingness" implies that "nothingness" caused the "universe" (something) therefore they both existed at some definitive point in reality. Personally i prefer to think of them both as parts of a whole, as neither something nor nothing are, or explain the whole. Like two necessary sides to the one coin (reality). The answer i think transcends and explains something and nothing but is neither one of them. 

When Nietzsche announces the death of God, due to his own contributions and that of his contemporaries and predecessors to philosophical progress, he means reliance on religion as a moral compass and source of meaning, is no longer tenable or relevant. Thus "god is dead", or more so the authority of god in the lives of people, is dead. I think he announced it in front of an atheistic public because he thought they'd be most receptive. 

In the 24th lecture of Steven Smiths Political Philosophy class at Yale available on ItunesU, he says that Patriotism is unethical because it implies "a blind deference to tradition" and sums it up in the Phrase, "my country, right or wrong". This seems contradictory for people who live in modern democratic societies because patriotism is at the very heart of democracy as the incentive to vote, and people who don't vote are often met with disdain as it appears that they don't love or care about their country enough to vote. It would seem that the conflict is, what is ethically the stronger drive in human nature, the love of ones wisdom (which is at times anti-patriotic) or the love of ones country? I am familiar with Plato's Crito and the Apology and am looking for an argument which is pro-patriotic that is equally or more compelling than Socrates argument for the love of ones own wisdom as being most ethically sound. 

when it came to ensuring mission success, when making decisions like choosing between sacrificing number 1 (ryker) and number 2(data) captain picard would always do the mission himself (and sacrificed himself a few times but was always saved eventually)because he thought data's life was as valuable as anyone else, yet every crew member was always ready to sacrifice themselves at a moments notice, because mission success was more important than who lives and dies, because if no one sacrifices themselves, everybody dies. silly analogy, i know, but star trek always provides insightful thought experiments on leadership. in the immortal words of the mighty Spock; "logic dictates, that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few". i think this would be closer to the truth; commanders prerogative, during wartime i think the commander would make the decision based on utility and necessity, or how valuable the human or robot would be for future missions, which i think would negate either robot or humans arguments for declining mission. this makes the sacrifice the human as i assume the robot is intellectually and physically superior to the human, thus more valuable in its utility. generally in wartime (or any special mission) necessity is the dictator of action, and a decision based on utility would be most consistent with necessity 

Nietzche doesn't state that the Ubermensch wouldnt be willing to share his knowledge. the Ubermensch is a product of society, the Ubermensch does not come to an understanding of everything in isolation but rather in relation to society, that is his learning is dependant on the learning of others. Nietzche thought he was the antichrist (Übermensch) and wrote a book about it. Wouldn't Nietzche's Übermensch eventually fully understand how the brain works and determine how it can be influenced by stimulation so anyone could end up understanding everything just as the first Übermensch did, and just continue to live in an evolutioned human society still without a final meaning? Nietzche's meaning here is that for the Übermensch mastering the whole spectrum of human potential is the final meaning and that if everyone did end up understanding everything just as the first Übermensch did, they would continue to live in an evolutioned human society, but the understanding of the Übermensch would permeate the structure of society, and the society could no longer be evolution without purpose, it would be social evolution with the goal of mastering the whole spectrum of human potential, a society of Übermensch. so to this interpretation of nietzche his Übermensch does not contradict itself. 

There are generally 2 points of views to consider with this question, materialism which rex kerr has elaborated on and idealism which has its origins in Platos theory of forms, which is the basis for modern philosophy of mathematics. He basicly says that reality has 3 structures., the abstract, concrete and the unchanging forms. He says the forms are the true structure of reality, akin to the rigorous proofs that mathematics produces. Furthermore that the concrete reality is an illusion of how this information of the forms appears to sense perception and that the abstract is limited human attempts at true perception of these forms. In this view the only things which truly exist is unpercieved ideas in the form of laws which generate reality. Max tegmark recently wrote a book which he advocates as a theory of everything called 'our mathematical universe' which is categorised as extreme platonism. 

The scientific method operates by validating theories through observation and experimentation, if the observations and experimentation is inconsistent with the theory, the theory must be rethought. This requires that nature is fundamentally materialistic i.e. that everything is reducible to matter, for if it wasn't, their would be nothing to observe and experiment on. The success of science would suggest that this assumption is well founded, but with science not yet developing a definitive theory of consciousness or reality one could wonder if the influence of the assumption of materialism is the reason for the present shortcomings of science. So, could the assumption of materialism be a flaw in the scientific method? 

Realistically, morality and guilt have nothing to do with this question. Every lawyer knows, guilt on the part of the client has absolutely no bearing on the outcome of a trial, only guilt that can be proven, or absence of proof, will effect the outcome. A lawyer with a conscience might wrestle with the dilemma, but to assume all lawyers have a conscience is erroneous. For most lawyers, it is actually to their benefit financially to have a reputation for successfully defending guilty clients, as this attracts more guilty clients to hire a lawyer with this reputation, as they know, said lawyer will use the law to protect the guilty. Lawyers (not all, but in general) definitely do lie or pretend they don't know somethings, because above all, they are not necessarily concerned about their clients interest, or the public's interest, but about their individual financial interest. Could a lawyer with "flexible" morals justify immorally trying to win a trial if he is aware of the culpability of the defendant to further his financial self-interest? Definitely. "It's not what you know, but what you can prove". Even a judge can be aware of the individuals guilt and this wont change the outcome without evidence. 

It is posited that the most ethical reason for a person to become a doctor is out of a genuine altruistic desire to help people, in contrast to because it is a profession which pays well. Therefore is a doctor who doesnt help people who cant afford to pay unethical? Is it unethical for a doctor to accept monetary payment for services from the poor? 

in the most general terms possible, people are drawn to religions because religions take the thinking out of life, and therefore, removes sources of doubt and confusion. If we think of philosophy as the study of three questions, "what is there?" "how do i know?" and "what do i do?", all religions generally make claim to answering these questions, being why individuals are drawn to them, because they remove alot of confusion and doubt for the individual, allowing the individual to feel alot more confident by giving them a reason, meaning and purpose, to justify their life. Central to all religions is a doctrine of faith, i.e. believing in something without proof. This is important because without this faith, the individual would not be able to justify their sense of confidence in themself for having all the questions of life all figured out and would feel as though they have been reduced to a state of doubt and confusion. The feeling of having an answer to all of lifes questions is equivalent to a state of blissful ignorance, which removes the anxiety associated with the experience of acknowledging ones own ignorance. So you could say that people who follow religions dont need proof, because they have faith, something told to me in many heated discussions with religious peoples. The saddest thing about this is, many people, because they are born into religious societies or famillies, abandon their own reason and conform to the religion (to fit in to the crowd), because challenging a persons belief system (and effectively their sense of indentity and self-confidence) can have terrible consequences on a persons status in a community or family, and cause them to be met with scorn from their peers and closest family members whom they love. So, to what proves authenticity of ANY religion? There is no basis for proof, no justification for belief, other than that the individual believer chooses to believe. The inherent pscholgical need of human nature, to believe in something, outweighs any requirement of proof. To belive that all humans require proof to believe in an idea, implies that all humans are rational, which is both obviously and definitely not the case. 

Could an algorithm that writes algorithms be written? Wikipedia says: An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list of well-defined instructions for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. So could an algorithm (an effective method expressed as a finite list of well-defined instructions for calculating a function) that writes effective methods expressed as finite lists of well-defined instructions for calculating functions? 

Descartes solved his doubt himself and proved the primacy of the mind over the body with his "cogito ergo sum". 

In the fictitious universe of Star Trek, the Prime Directive is the guiding principle of the United Federation of Planets. The Prime Directive, prohibits Starfleet personnel from interfering with the internal development of alien civilizations. This conceptual law applies particularly to civilizations which are below a certain threshold of development, preventing starship crews from using their superior technology to impose their own values or ideals on them. The idea is that if civilizations have developed to the point of Warp drive capabillity, then they would have equivalently mature ethical theories, which loosely translates to; the smarter they are, the more ethical they should be, therefore first contact is warranted. That is, a barbaric civilization wouldnt possess the intellectual sophistication to have a whole wealth of technology and resources we could benefit from, these are generally the fruits of refinement. 

The relation between the complexity classes P and NP is studied in computational complexity theory, the part of the theory of computation dealing with the resources required during computation to solve a given problem. The most common resources are time (how many steps it takes to solve a problem) and space (how much memory it takes to solve a problem). In such analysis, a model of the computer for which time must be analyzed is required. Typically such models assume that the computer is deterministic (given the computer's present state and any inputs, there is only one possible action that the computer might take) and sequential (it performs actions one after the other). In this theory, the class P consists of all those decision problems that can be solved on a deterministic sequential machine in an amount of time that is polynomial in the size of the input; the class NP consists of all those decision problems whose positive solutions can be verified in polynomial time given the right information, or equivalently, whose solution can be found in polynomial time on a non-deterministic machine. Clearly, P ⊆ NP. Arguably the biggest open question in theoretical computer science concerns the relationship between those two classes: Is P equal to NP? What would be the philosophical implications of a solution to the P versus NP problem? 

Is our Philosophy, the Human Philosophy, the only possible Philosophy which can exist? I would say yes, but not in the sense of human philosophy, but of philosophy in the objective sense, not reliant on human philosophers to define what philosophy is, the concept of philosophy akin to Plato's forms. For any philosopher, human or non-human, the practice would necessarilly be centred around the desire to understand reality, so naturally a first question would arise; "What is there"? and then as a necessary implication of trying to answer the first question, a second question would arise, for any given answer to "What is there"? would imply "How do i know"?. And thirdly, upon becoming self-conscious about how i know what there is, would imply a question of, what should i do with my knowledge of "how i know what there is"? or more simply, what should i do? Thus, the study of Metaphysics, Epistemology and Ethics are born. Any conscious entity would be concerned with these 3 questions regardless of whatever language they speak or of their placement in any conceivable existance as these three questions which are the core of philosophy are inseperable from thinking and would be applicable to every conceivable existance of any conscious entity. 

i think having a work ethic is not necessarily ethical but can be consistent with ethics in regards to self-development and virtue. i disagree with "Having a work ethic means being disciplined and hard-working" and rather think that everybody has a work ethic regardless of how disciplined and hard-working they are. I think its more like people with less discipline and who are lazy have a poor work ethic in contrast to people who have more discipline and are hard-working have a strong work ethic. Prudence consistently being the number one virtue for many philosophers implies that in terms of enlightened self development that the more regular, consistently and harder one works in this regard the further one will get in self-development. in this context one could conclude that a strong work ethic is a virtue and that laziness is a vice. Also in Aristotles definition of virtue he says that all virtue is a medium on a continuum of excess and deficiency, so one could say that being a control freak or over achiever could be the excess, and laziness the deficiency, with the virtue of a strong work ethic residing in the correct balance.
