Philosophy differs from purely logical systems in the same way that humans differ from machines. Philosophy has a history... or histories. And it struggles to retain its history lest it fall into a sort of synchronic Alzheimer's syndrome, logical but without meaning, value, development, or content. The non-philosophers you cite may be called "philosophers," even against their own devout wishes, because they are familiar with and responding quite precisely to this historical evolution of philosophical ideas and problems. Specifically, the modern existentialists were responding to Heidegger and Hegel, among many others, who were in turn responding to Husserl and Kant. Even Camus, arguably more of a literary influence, is hardly abandoning reason or the heightened "self-consciousness" of metaphysics. By the time we trace this complex, running dialogue back to Kant, we are already dealing at a rather deep, complex level with the insufficiencies of your definition and the many failed attempts to reduce philosophy, by rationalism or empiricism, to some inarguable logic... and then the logic to some, certain, "value-free" axioms, and so forth. Had you posed your question in 1780, say, the answer would already be "been there, done that." You are certainly not alone in your complaint. Quine and many other notables protested strenuously when Cambridge offered Derrida an honorary degree, causing a great hubbub. But Derrida too was very much an interpreter and historian of philosophy, reason, and its concerns. We have to remember that philosophy's origins among the pre-Socratics were hardly "logical" and mingled physics with poetry, argumentation, and morals. Empedocles, Diogenes, Rousseau, Newton, Marx, Herder, Freud, Weil, Mach, Parsons, Cioran, Habbermas, Kuhn, Foucault, Derrida...there are thousands who could arguably be or were cashiered from "philosophy proper" and probably didn't care. But the danger in narrowing this self-conscious history is to reduce philosophy to amnesia, futile logic chopping, and the repetition to which ahistorical minds are supposedly doomed. 

I haven't read Solaris and hardly know where to go with this question. It touches upon so many essential questions in philosophy. You are basically asking about a definitional limit between life and non-life, biology and physics, which are often described as two different types of causality. The classic, if outdated, text on this from the physics standpoint is Schrodinger's "What Is Life?" Which suggests crystals as a borderline case. An idea which remains scientifically open. On the other hand, the philosophical idea of a pure, inhuman "system-environment" differential is best described by Luhmann and other "systems" theorists, who are not really interested in "life" as some essential boundary. However, your description of the "sea" in Solaris seems problematic. If it just "abides" as a self "in itself" without erasing memory and reproducing, then it does seem to be missing an essential quality of life. It is just some mythical god who endlessly exists. Rather meaningless. I suspect that such an entity could not actually "communicate." Part of the definition of "communication" entails finite, separated selves. And "finite"means mortal. I suspect this "sea" was not thought out with philosophical consistency. To go further into the problems here would be hard work, and I am very lazy and not terribly knowledgeable. I hope this little bit helps. 

Yes, of course. You can *scientifically prove** things deemed supernatural. But once you do, they are no longer supernatural. They are "natural," as demonstrated by the methods of the natural sciences. However, you are probably wasting your time on the various hobgoblins and eerie powers you list. We do not see such phenomena, werewolves, resurrections, or mind controls, requiring scientific explanation. One must first demonstrate them publicly and repeatedly, which in most cases defies their very definition. As Hume pointed out, what we mean by a "miracle" is precisely that which cannot be predicted, controlled, or experimentally repeated. We now fly, cure plague, transmit voices over miles, and perform other formerly "miraculous" deeds. But they are no longer "miracles," except metaphorically. Likewise, magnetism, seances, ghosts, and such have often intrigued hopeful scientists and philosophers. With his tolerant epistemology, William James, for one, "liked to turn the lights down low, to give miracles a chance," as Oliver Wendell Holmes put it. The search is never over, the possibilities are never finally foreclosed. So it is not impossible that some of the Weird World shenanigans you mention may be coaxed into science. We never saw X-rays before, so perhaps meaningful "auras" will be detected. We never operated machines with direct neural input before, so perhaps such capacities may be somehow projected telepsychically. We never created genetically monstrous mice or glowing rabbits before, so perhaps werewolves are right around the corner. The point is that you mistake the categories. Anything can become an object of scientific method. But once it is adequately demonstrated, contextualized within existing bodies of theory, passes experimental testing, and test results are repeatable "at will" we no longer call it "supernatural." And, of course, there's the problem of research funding... 

This should be reduced to a comment, but I will say that I find Luxembourg very good in general, but sometimes bewildering in detail. This being Luxembourg, I suspect that we may be dealing here with questions of raw materials extracted through colonized labor and embedded in the material structure of a society, but not entering into values derived from "production." In other words, the the abiding remnants of "merchant capital." While this is pure speculation, she may be criticizing Smith for collapsing merchant capitalism into the "pure critical logic" used by Marx to analyze industrial capitalism. Of course, Smith would be right to do so, but he wouldn't know it. Since Luxembourg devoted herself to Volume Two, we are dealing with very complex second-order "motions" of capital. These would include the remnants of "merchant capital" that appeared even less relevant to Marx than to Smith. Marx may conceive of "constant capital" narrowly in the production process (for theoretical reasons), where a social "fixed capital" must widen the view to those institutions materialized out of international trade. Pure gibberish, for what it's worth. 

This question is asked out of a relative ignorance of "analytic" or "Anglo-American" proceedings, so broad, simplified answers are quite welcome. A slew of terms may be used to characterize the approaches of individual philosophers as, say, realists, cognitivists, constructivists, naturalists, evolutionary epistemologists, and so forth. Stances with respect to reductionism, AI, metaphysics, relativism, skepticism, and also "fence in" various debates. Can the field today be roughly divided into broad, contending positions? Perhaps ten or so. I do not mean topics or areas of study, but arguments and beliefs that are typically incompatible and can be identified by commonly used terms.... somewhat in the manner of Bacon or Kant's rough division of "rationalists" and "empiricists." I'm looking for the sort of overview of contemporary positions that is hard to sift out of indexes or sources like SEP.... and, it must be added, that individual philosophers themselves are usually quick to deny. 

This is a very interesting question that would seem to have both obvious answers and deeper ones. Since I know little about it, I can only pass along what amounts to hearsay. Obviously, massive data crunching impacts the sorts of questions that can be asked and potentially falsified, more or less across the board. One interesting case is practical or "experimental" mathematics. Paul Erdos, it is said, refused to believe the "logically correct" answer to the "Monty Hall Problem" until the results of massively repeated trials were computed by brute force. And this seems epistemologically a very peculiar sort of development, a confirmation of a prediction not by "nature" but by a machine replication of the logic that proposed it. Science is partly pattern recognition and partially observation of "objects." Like the telescope or microscope, data crunching "reveals" things that could not be seen before. But what are these things? The ontological status of a "correlation" that is purely statistical rather than linear and causal is now mainstream science, since Darwin or Boltzmann, but was still an unsettling development for many, such as Einstein. As @AlexanderKing astutely points out, "correlations" are infinite and may have some potential to subvert the sort of "enabling constraint" offered by experiment. There was originally some question for his contemporaries as to whether Galileo's telescope was purely transmitting or actually constructing the "evidence" it presented. Since very little science can now be done without the "sensory apparatus" of massive data crunching, we seem to be slipping unavoidably into a more "constructivist" circle of confirming-predicting. Sorry, these are more musings than answers. I hope more are forthcoming. 

Several recent books address this topic at least partly from the standpoint of contemporary physics. Jim Holt's "Why Does the World Exist?" and Lawrence Krauss "A Universe from Nothing." The answers, such as "quantum fluctuation" or whatnot, are not terribly convincing. It is clearly an area where physicists leave the confines of physics proper to engage in metaphysics, often without much knowledge of the philosophical tradition here. The concept of "ex nihilo" simply cannot fit within any rules of "physics." Yet such metaphysical speculation, by definition beyond experimental confirmation, is perhaps necessary for the groping advancement of physics. Causality, space, and time are being redefined under new extensions of mathematics and instrumentation. Not sure what your last sentence means. Bit of a ramble. Anyway, it was Leibniz not Heidegger who first posed the question in this way, and it seems to me best resolved by Kant's limits on knowledge, which act as the "enabling constraints" of free speculation. It is generally understood that physicists who address such questions are "off duty." 

While I certainly defer to Virmaior's excellent answer and its interesting tail of commentary, can this be anything but a question of terminology, probably settled only in ancient Greek etymology? The term "broader" creates problems. In ordinary language people "give reasons," as Rorty liked to put it. Anyone and everyone goes through life answering "because" questions, and it takes no special training and, mostly crucially, no definitive or numerical exclusions. To "give reasons" can be ambiguous and ironic, it allows parable and paradox. In this existential and sociological sense it can be seen as "broader." Available to all. On the other hand, "logos" is the suffix affixed to all fields of knowledge, presumably to get at the universal essence of things. Whether such universality is "broader" than human beings "reasoning" with one another is, of course, one of the great, abiding disputes of philosophy. Husserl, perhaps, is a paradigmatic modern case of the idea that some sort of necessary "logic" is inclusive of what can be properly "reasoned." My own sense is that most people (aka "me") would consider "reasoning" broader. And the reason is that is can include compelling forces of irony, paradox, parable, double meanings, etc. in a way that "logic" must rule out. And it would be wrong to conclude that "logic" is thereby more precise, necessary, and universal. As the various forms of "indeterminacy" that have become embedded in modern physics indicate, it is logic that must answer to reason. Logic struggles to be precise. For the human capacity to "reason" absolute precision is not only infinitely regressive, it is death, closure. 

The question is indeed exceedingly broad, largely historical, and liable to be closed, perhaps rightly. But just quickly and generally, in addition to Shane's interesting answer, I would first say that the attachment of the Old Testament to the Gospel and the doctrines of Paul was not obvious nor a foregone conclusion. Indeed, it was, in my own view, very unfortunate, weighing down with confusion, ritual, and patriarchal bile an otherwise Axial Age message, as Karl Jaspers defined it, alongside those of Buddha, Confucius, and Socrates. The reason was in part the very high esteem in which the Roman world held all things ancient, including the Jewish scriptures. Antiquity itself was a form of validity and legal sanction. And the absence of a particular historical "authorship" preserved the interwoven texts against skeptical attack. As a "nouveau enthusiasm," on the other hand, Christian cults appeared disorderly, artificial, and garish. Cementing hermeneutical relations with the ancient texts was a crucial evolutionary adaptation. Of all the texts at last included into the New Testament, Revelations was the most highly debated, and again, in my view, unfortunate. It makes a jarring addendum, following the Jewish wars and the destruction of the Second Temple, to the universalist advances of the Gospels and Pauline epistles, with its crypto-revolutionary, horror-movie denunciations of the Roman system, enemies within, and earthly law. Then the American period of interpretive democracy. It is essential to a "sacred text" that it remain alive and avoid historical closure by ceaselessly generating interpretations out of contradictions, parables, and complexities.. and that it "regenerate" societies and administrations capable of so preserving the text. For better or worse, the Bible in the New World underwent the textual equivalent of the Cambrian Explosion. Geography gave rise to rapid speciation. From the moment the Puritans expelled Roger Williams, the spacious land enabled dozens of break-away denominations and sects to flourish, creating their own idiosyncratic interpretations unconstrained by violent authority... or by rational debate. While some were utopian, many American denominations not surprisingly seized upon the wretched old patriarchal narratives and the fear-mongering of Revelations, a legacy still roiling our political system. Sorry, little more than an opinionated sketch, but given the likelihood the question will be closed anyway, why not? A more specific answer to your question would entail a veritable history of church doctrines. 

"Man is born free. Therefore, man has the right to be free." First, we might ask Man's mother about that. Philosophy as well as religion tends to neglect the role of Mrs. Man in all this splendid a priori freedom. Hobbes is the only philosopher I happen to know of who actually refers in anecdote to his mother, his difficult birth, and the consequences for his philosophy, one in which "rights" are conspicuously absent in "nature." The point being that observations of "nature" itself give absolutely no evidence of such "rights." Humans are quite obviously social and interdependent, and moral rules entail the forfeiture of conflicting assertions of "right." Marx referred mockingly to the a priori British assumption of individual rights as "Robinsonism,"after Robinson Crusoe. In his stricter development of Locke's empiricism, Hume's own observations of "natural" perceptions led him to state pithily that: "You can't get an ought from an is." In other words, facts simply do not contain moral values, as assumed in "rights," and for many years this "fact-value" dichotomy hobbled the atomistic Anglo-American stance, as opposed to the more socially inclined Continental traditions. So, yes, one can argue that the inference of "rights" from "nature" is not empirically valid, and in logic would appear not as a fallacy per se, but as a dubious premise. But "nature" itself is another rather dubious premise, and the question of "rights" is really quite enormous, with many philosophical responses. Much of Kant's philosophy was precisely an attempt to rescue moral premises from Humean skepticism by means of reason.This was revived in Rawls' pragmatic, highly influential attack on the traditional "fact-value" divide.
