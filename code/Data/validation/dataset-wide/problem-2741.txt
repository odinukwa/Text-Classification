will be supertrue (superfalse) iff under all (no) acceptable precisifications of the predicate "bald", the sentence comes out true. A precisification will have the form "... has n hairs", where, e.g., n = 0 is acceptable, but n = 10^6 is not. Sadly, the sentence above is supertrue -- which is the supervaluationist criterion for accepting it as true. Luckier folk, such as, say, Andy, might come out bald according to some precisifications and not bald according to others. Thus, 

I know nothing about the Tao Te Ching, but the sentences you quote are not (logically) contradictory, or paradoxical: 

What you have in mind is the principle of the identity of indiscernibles: the idea that no two different things can have the exact same properties. The SEP entry I've linked to above has a nice bibliography at the end. This principle entails your claim that no two things can ever be identical: if a and b are identical (i.e., if they have the same properties), then "a" and "b" are two names of the same thing. 

In a lecture on philosophy of science, the lecturer said something to the effect that the necessity of identity and Kripke's theory of rigid designators "provides a path back to scientific realism" in contrast to the anti-realism of positivists and the relativism of Kuhn. The typical "both the morning star and the evening star are venus" and "water == H2O" examples were given to illustrate the necessity of identity, and then the discussion moved straight to explaining what scientific realism was, without really explaining why realism and Kripke's result are connected. So how does one make the leap from Kripke's ideas to scientific realism? 

This list is obviously not exhaustive, and several of these questions and topics are interrelated. For example questions of metaphysics and philosophy or religion tend to go hand in hand, as do questions of ethics and political philosophy. As I mentioned earlier, I have found it much easier to approach philosophy via these fundamental questions then by start with philosopher X and ending with philosopher Y. 

Well, such sentences will be true for all precisifications, because either Andy has n hairs or he doesn't, for all n. Therefore, the sentence comes out supertrue -- this is the supervaluationist for accepting it as true. Its negation ("it's not the case that Andy is bald or Andy is not bald"), by the same token, comes out superfalse. The same will happen with every other vague sentence: the supervaluationist semantics validates LEM. Supervaluationism is a semantics that validates LEM but not PB. 

EDIT: The above is how one can see that negation as suggested by Belnap and Dunn is reasonable. But I agree with the questioner that it is unclear that the logic, so described, is a product system. A bit more detail on how to see Dunn/Belnap's system (DB henceforth) as a product system: In DB we have four truth degrees: 

In any event, that we can think and talk about stuff we are not (in Russell's turn of phrase) acquainted with is unproblematic: we become competent users of a singular term that refers, say, to Socrates (whom neither I nor anyone I know have ever met) by becoming a link in a chain of speakers that takes us all the way back to people that was acquainted with Socrates. We are, as Gareth Evans puts it in "The Varieties of Reference", introduced to a name-using practice. You may want to check Mark Sainsbury's "Reference Without Referents" for a more contemporary discussion of these ideas. In Sainsbury's version of the theory, a name-using practice can exist even in the absence of a referent -- think of the unsuccessful name 'Vulcano', that tried to refer to a (nonexistent) planet between Mercury and the Sun. This would be an example of speech (and thought) without an entity we are thinking or talking about. Believers in God, hell, and the like, I take it, believe that we have been introduced to name-using practices of terms that refer to those entities: think Moses, or Christ, who were, the story goes, acquainted with some of those things. An interesting case is our apparent ability to refer to abstracta ("the number 2" successfully refer to the number 2, it seems). Here, of course, acquaintance or causal contact of any kind is impossible. One idea that I find attractive is that we don't really refer to such entities. We merely make believe that we do; we fictionalize about them. For the best worked out theory along these lines, read Kendall Walton's "Mimesis as Make-Believe", or the latest papers by Stephen Yablo on the philosophy of mathematics. 

So it is possible to "translate" continental ideas into analytic style prose, and presumably it has been done before many times (per the continuing demand). Have there been any such analytic expositions of Heidegger, and Derrida? I find Derrida hard to understand, and Heidegger outright impossible, and none of the lectures or sources I've looked at make any sense at all w/r to the latter. 

I am a little confused. On one hand, he states that "This state and this society produce religion", which seems to confirm my original interpretation that religion is a tool of oppression used by the upper class. On the other hand, he later says "Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions.", which I read as saying that religion is a reaction by the masses to the oppression brought on them by the ruling class, not a tool of the the ruling class itself. To extend the drug analogy of the famous part of the quote, the masses are self medicating on the religious opium, it is not being forced on them by their overlords. So which view is correct according to Marx: Is religion a self-administered reaction to oppression? or is it a tool of domination administered by the ruling class? 

The right way to understand Mandelbrot's claim is: the coast of England can be profitably modelled as a fractal (for some purposes). It's exactly the same kind of claim as "The granma pie at Luigi's is a rectangle". So, no: the coast of England is not literally a fractal, and it's not in the world of forms -- it's actually in England :) 

There is no accepted term for the study of change in metaphysics, analogous to ontology for the study of what there is, or mereology for the study of the parthood relation. Many scholars resort to the phrase "the problem of change", or "the problem of persistence". 

Therefore A. EDIT: I see by your comment below that you are interested in question-begging arguments in general. 

A point on terminology: identity is normally taken to refer to the relation that every thing bears with, and only with, itself. So understood, of course, identity is possible: I am identical with myself, you with yourself and everything with itself. 

First of all, you mention a 'Taboo regarding Indian Philosophy'. There is no such Taboo. A Taboo is something that people are not allowed to discuss by religious or social custom. Nobody is worried that they would get banned or censored from the Philosophy SE, or from their university's philosophy department, if they brought up the subject of Indian Philosophy. Contrast that to what would happen if someone tried to discuss a philosophy justifying racial superiority, or pedophilia, or some such topic, then you will come up against a real taboo. Second, you state that Western philosophers are 'unfair' to Indian Philosophy. Well Western philosophers are in the business of doing Western Philosophy, so of course they are biased, by definition, towards their own discipline. Are physicists 'unfair' to biology? Are Classical musicians 'unfair' to Jazz music? Or are they simply doing what they are trained and paid to do? In the same way, in true Dawkinesque fashion, Western philosophers are simply doing what Western Philosophy wants them to do, which is perpetuate Western Philosophy. Finally, you mention in your comments that Western Philosophers have been unduly critical of Indian scripture and religious texts. I would like to point out that Western philosophers have been far more critical of their own Judeo-Christian traditions, than they have been of any Eastern Traditions. If anything you can argue that Western philosophers and academics have taken Indian philosophical traditions way more seriously than they have a lot of their homegrown ideas: When was the last time you saw a treatise on Valhallic philosophy or the divinities department of a major Western university include serious Scientology studies course? 

is that such a statement is as hard to falsify as the original statement is to verify -- and, conversely, as easy (!) to verify as the original statement is to falsify. This point is not new, of course; it was already made by Hempel back in the day. 

So, sure enough, (4) is true: it's a material conditional with a false antecedent; nothing in s not being the case can make it false that if s then r. The puzzlement over this line of the truth table of the material conditional is recurrent at Philosophy SE. Look around and you'll find other related questions. 

appropiate. In the philosophy I am familiar with, the debate is cast as being about the norm of assertion: The quest for the norm of assertion is the quest for a norm (roughly, an imperative) such that a speech act counts as an assertion if and only if it is subject to said norm. Candidate norms of assertion take the form Norm Schema: : Assert that p only if F(p) where F(p) is a function that takes the proposition to be asserted and outputs a specification of the circumstances in which such an assertion is warranted. There are various contenders for the role of F(p) . Let me discuss them briefly in turn. Truth: : F(p) takes p to itself. That is: one should assert only what is true (see Weiner 2005, 2007.) This looks like a natural demand on assertion; after all, assertions aim at the truth -- that is, it is very likely that they fulfill their function in language by mapping onto facts (see Millikan 1984, p. 108f). The standard complaint against Truth is that it is far too weak to be the central norm of assertion. For what if one truly asserts that p on the basis of extremely poor evidence, e.g., one asserts a lucky guess or a correctly believed product of wishful thinking? Surely, one may claim, the asserter in these instances would be subject to criticism despite satisfying Truth. (Lackey 2007, p. 604) The obvious fix to the this problem is to demand that the asserter be justified in believing the asserted proposition. Thus, the justification norm, Justification: : F(p) takes p to the asserter is justified in believing that p. This is sometimes put in terms of the asserter having a reasonable/rational belief in p. Justification is also plausible: it seems reasonable to assume that the asserter has to be in the right kind of evidential relation to the proposition asserted -- and, indeed, we find assertions blameless when they are done in these circumstances. On the other hand, there are cases of objectionable assertions made in the appropriate evidential state. Lotteries seem to supply such examples: if I assert 'Your ticket did not win' merely because I know that only one in a milion does, I may have extremely good evidence -- one that makes you ticket not winning overwhelmingly likely, and my belief that it won't rational and reasonable -- but I still contravene the norm of assertion. Williamson summarises the idea: 

efficiency(QC) > efficiency(non-QC) > efficiency(Human). therefore efficiency(QC) > efficiency(Human). therefore. QC ≠ Human. 

What's the philosophical status of the question of the existence of extraterrestrial? Is it taken seriously? Has any notable philosopher written about it? Can it be considered to be part of metaphysics ? Has anyone written about the implications of the answer: What does it mean for us if yes? What does it mean for us if no? 

So things like the fundamental theorem of calculus and probability theory can't be falsified because they don't correspond to anything observable. They, like all mathematical truths are proved solely using the rules and axioms of logic. This is the whole point of falsification, one has to attempt to show that they empirically observe a phenomena that contradicts their theory. So the Newton's theory of gravity says that apples should fall every time we let go of them in midair. Pre Popper's falsificationism, Newton's theory is falsified if someone raises an apple lets go of it, and instead of it falling it hovers in the air or goes upwards. Similarly per Popper, heliocentrism will be falsified the day that Venus or Mars, or one of the other planets is observed in a different orbit then the one predicted by the theory. This points to an interesting problem with Popper's theory, that of auxiliary hypotheses (also called the Duhem-Quine thesis, or they idea that all observations are theory laden): Consider that at the beginning of the 19th century the orbit of Uranus was different than what was predicted by Newtoninan mechanics and heliocentrism. But astronomers, instead of abandoning the theory, concluded that there was an unknown planet modifying the orbit of Uranus, which they later confirmed and called Neptune. So the dilemma is: When observation contradicts theory, is the theory falsified? or is there missing data that can explain the mismatch between theory and predictions? The issue of how to solve the problem of auxiallry hypotheses is still debated, and hasn't been solved yet. See the ideas of W.V.O Quine, Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend, all in response to Popper's concept of falsification. 

This means that, in order to apply negation to the different truth values, you apply it (classically) to each of its components: 

It comes from Popper's work on falsification. Popper's idea is supposed to apply to all inductive knowledge. For what it's worth, most philosophers of science (as opposed, maybe, to scientists with an interest in philosophy) take Popper's views on confirmation to be wrong. 

is both true and false. Of course, if you are to say such a thing you need to tweak logic to avoid ex falso quodlibet, the feature of classical logic in virtue of which one is allowed to derive anything from p-and-not-p. Such logics without explosion, paraconsistent logics, do exist, though, and the dialetheists that have formulated them (at least the ones I know) are highly intelligent, highly rational folk :) 

The reason some empiricists (most notably Popper) have denied that we can verify an empirical hypothesis is that they were thinking of universally quantified statements such as 

I have been following the news about the current US administration reversing the Obama administration's policies on campus sexual assault. The two opposing positions can be summed as following: 

The fine-tuning argument for the existence of God is based on the fact that certain physical constants can only have very specific values for life to exist in the universe. If there was even the slightest change in any of these constants, the universe would have evolved in a completely different way, and biological life would have been impossible in our universe. The argument then goes that this is evidence for the creation of the universe by a creator who chose those constants specifically so that we could eventually exist. They contend that it was highly unlikely that those constants are due to chance, given the large number of possible values that they could have taken. The only refutation I found of the argument from fine-tuning is that there is nothing unlikely about our universe having the right physical constants for biological life, because this debate wouldn't be happening at all unless there was biological life to start with. This is called the anthropic principle. But this argument doesn't make sense unless there was a statistical population of universes that our universe was pulled from, i.e some form or another of multiverse. Is it possible to refute the fine-tuning argument for God's existence without subscribing to the idea that our universe is just one in a vast multiverse?
