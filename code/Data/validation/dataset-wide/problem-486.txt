So at least for this one study, it appears that allowing your body to start fast, end fast and self pace in the middle, rather than adhering to a strict pace schedule has much better results. While this does not directly address going all out to exhaustion, I would suspect that you would have similar results, in that the body could not clear metabolic waste fast enough to allow completion in a time faster than a inverted U type pace. 

If you want to step up in price, you can look at the Cervelo S5 (Cervelo is arguably the best bike company around for understanding aerodynamics), which has a much more protected rear wheel, the forks more integrated with the frame, and much cleaner lines throughout. 

Second is the frame shape and tube shapes. For the entry level, you may not see a lot of difference (Especially in the known name brands), but almost all still have top tubes that slope downward towards the seat tube, and a few have smaller cutouts for the rear wheel. When you move up the price ladder, tubes start changing shape, and aerodynamic considerations become much more dramatic. As you can see in the Specialized Venge below, the top tube slopes away from the headset, and the seat tube is notched much more than the entry level rides to accommodate a tire being closer and more protected, which increases aerodynamics. The tubes are also more oval/wing shaped, rather than round. 

There are various rebuild kits available on the web, the site Excel Sports has various options, from replacing just the bowties if the main pedal is sound, or the entire pedal surface. I have custom length spindles to accommodate foot splay, so I have used both a couple times to avoid the big outlay on replacement. 

Remember, very few road racers are giving it hell from a standing start. The vast majority of the time they are traveling at a fairly high rate of speed as they approach the end of the race (With the lead out for the sprint, positioning, etc), so the need to jump multiple gears is very limited. Other times where quick acceleration is needed is to jump a gap or catch a potential breakaway, take advantage of a person lagging on a climb, things of this nature. Again, they are traveling at speed, not from a standing start. The reason that you have to jump gears is that it is easy to push the gears (low torque), but you quickly speed up past the point where the gear is effective, and depending on your cassette, you may have already almost passed the speed where the next gear up is effective. Also, road racers often swap gearing in their cassettes, but this is to match the gearing to the terrain. If you are going to be in a mostly flat race, there is no need to have a 28 tooth large cog in the back, so they might go with an 11-20. Conversely, if there is a lot of steep climbing, they may swap to some kind of 12-28 (or greater) configuration. Track bikes (Which would have more relevance to short burst from standing starts in some of the events) have no gearing, they are fixed. 

Just as a confirmation on the comments above, I found a post on a separate forum definitely recommending to use the specific manufacturer grease, with a couple of the following points (Cited here for possible link decay): For the grease itself- 

So rather than blame the bike, realize that it is most likely going to be user error or a stress beyond what was intended by the manufacturer. Although, I would also make sure that while it looks cool, you need to realize that even the amateurs in the video spend hours practicing, and working their way up from basic trails/tricks to the stuff you see in the video. Along the way, you are definitely going to break a frame or two. It's the nature of the beast. 

It's going to be highly variable. If it is always the same foot that you use to unclip, then it may be as simple as being dragged/scraped on the ground at stops. Also, as has been pointed out, the more you use a specific cleat the more that it will wear. Another thing that could be contributing is leg length and improper fit. If your leg does not track straight up and down, or if you have a large amount of float in your cleat, the motion/rubbing could be causing premature cleat wear. This might be able to be corrected with shims under one or other of your cleats. Also, it could be that there is something wrong/worn in the pedal itself on that side, causing excessive wear to the cleats. Lots of variables, probably not a real definitive answer unless there is something glaringly wrong with one of the above. 

What kind of steel? IIRC, powder coating/anodizing can't be done on all metals, and some metals have less options and are more costly (Such as Ti frames). Also, you have to consider the effect of the heat in the process on the welds, and whether they will be affected. A paint job will probably never be as durable as powdercoating or anodizing, but unless you're really hard on your bikes, the only places you might notice it are on the unders of the bike where rocks may strike, and you can get clear protectors for those areas if you want. The other thing to consider is if you want customization. Take a site such as HotTubes and the paint jobs they have produced, you aren't going to be able to get that with a baked finish. 

There is an article on Runners World that asked somewhat the same question, do you start fast or do an even pace? The general conclusion is that elite runners tend to start faster than their eventual main pace, and also increase speed for the finish. The article also cites a study done with 15 well trained cyclists on a 20km time trial. The basic methodology was they did a 20k at their own pace, then two other trials at a steady state to exhaustion. In the secondary (steady state) trials, 9 of the 15 failed to finish the 20k. (The steady state was designed to mimic the same power output as the self paced trial.) 

At any intersection that has marked turn lanes, I position myself inside the outermost turn lane, inside the line enough that I can't be squeezed between a turning car and one going straight. I then proceed through the intersection on a slightly wider path than the car will take so as not to impeded traffic any more than possible, and head for the bike lane. 

All of the information that you need is on this page for USA Cycling. There are three levels for road cycling, starting with C, then B and A. C level I believe is just a clinic that you attend, pass the post test (70% minimum IIRC) and you must be 16. To move up from C to B, there are 11 modules that must be taken and passed, and then to move to Level A, there are requirements for races attended, level of races officiated, and other age requirements. The officials manuals detail these, and are located on this page. There are different requirements for Mountain and BMX (I believe they skip the B level), and the local contacts for Missouri (If your profile location is still correct) are located on this page. As far as fees, etc., that is going to vary from race to race and with the level of the race. I know at the races that our club puts on and a majority of the races in the region, the officials are compensated. 

Tuneups - You generally get one free at about 30 days after you buy the bike. Mostly this consists of readjusting the derailleurs (shifting mechanisms) and the brakes as the cables stretch. Tuneups in my area (Phoenix, Az) cost between $50-75 depending on shop and any replacement parts. Avg 2-3x per year Tires/Tubes - Ongoing. I recommend a tougher tire such as gatorskins ($50 each) for training, and then switching to a performance tire (Conti GP 4000 - $65 per tire) for racing. Tubes range from $7 to $15 each. I would just stick with butyl, even latex for racing is a bit overkill to start. Avg 6-8 tubes per year, 1-2 tires (per wheel). Chain/cassette - $50-100 per cassette, $20-50 per chain depending on quality, plus shop cost to install/change. 1-2x per year depending on maintenance and mileage. 

The biggest difference is strength. There are some road stems that will say they are not recommended for downhill/freeride type riding, but are ok for cyclocross. Road stems will also come in a larger range of angles. Just be sure that when you are looking at stems, you match the clamp of the stem to your steerer tube (1" or 1 1/4" usually) and to the diameter of the bars that you are using. 

The stiffer a frame is, the more it resists flexing under load. For the sake of demonstration, say you have a carbon frame that under a load of 400 watts of pedaling power has 2" of flexion. The actual power going to the wheels is 400 - Cost to flex. Now you take a frame that only flexes 1". Less of your power goes into flexing the frame, so more power gets translated to the wheels, which results in a faster bike. The stiffer a frame, the harsher the ride in general, so it may not be quite as comfortable. If you are familiar with cars at all, it's the same concept behind horsepower at the crank, versus horsepower at the wheels. 

Trainers are notorious for chewing up regular tires. They do sell trainer tires that are built to take the rubbing and wear that a trainer dishes out. What a lot of people do is buy a cheap wheel (Such as a neuvation or similar), throw a trainer tire on it and use that when they mount their bike to the trainer. 

You are asking two questions, one about the bike and one about the tires. Road bikes can easily go on gravel, or even off road. However, the ride quality and handling will be compromised the more "off road" you go. As far as the tires, the more you have "road" tires, the more flats you will have. This is due to the thin nature of road tires for less rolling resistance combined with higher pressure. Road tires have PSI (Pounds per square inch, a measure of air pressure) in the 100-120 range, with very thin tires (and tubes, if you use something like a latex tube) to reduce resistance. Cyclocross tires are thicker, will sometimes have treads to handle grass, mud, water, etc. They will run anywhere from 24-40 PSI depending on type of tire and conditions. Once you go to mountain tires, then you are also putting on lower pressure, and you have much thicker tire and tube material. 

Massage - feels better without all the hair tugging. Taping/bandaging - In the event of a crash, taping and bandaging is easier without hair. Additionally, wounds in general are cleaner when incurred without hair. Vanity - Hair tends to cast shadows and blur the edges of well defined muscle. Cooling - Hair is an insulator, so especially hairy individuals will shave for the cooling effect. 

The final area is the trickle down technology in the groupsets, which consists of your derailleurs, brifters (brake/shifter combination), brakesets. The Shimano 105 and SRAM Force groupsets, which you typically find on the more entry level bikes are comparable to the Dura Ace and Red groups of 4-5 years ago, and as the top levels advance, the technology of the former top groups starts falling down to the next tiers below. In bikes, you can have light, cheap and reliable. You get to pick any two from that list. 

Nickel plated chains have this done for aesthetic purposes, and to provide corrosion resistance. They are also less susceptible to the chain binding itself up. When two metallic surfaces create friction against each other, they create small areas of abrasion (Much like a plaque in your arteries). Over time, these increase to the point where the chain can kink in spots. Nickel helps to stave this off. The wearing may be slightly higher than with a non coated chain, but the difference to the lifespan of the cogs (cassette) is negligible. Chains should be replaced around the 2500km mark on a regular basis, and cassettes anywhere from 5000-10000km depending on many factors. You'll go through 2-3 chains per cassette, and usually I replace my cassette with every 3rd chain no matter what. Dust/dirt/mud and poor maintenance will do more harm and accelerate wear faster than any plating on the chain will.
