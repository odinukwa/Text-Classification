Killing the RO is hard but we could remove it from power temporarily for a start. three letters, EMP The RO would be based in a decentralized redundant fortified server network that would be hardened against emp. Hunting down and destroying every server where the RO lives is unlikely to ever work, especially when the populous loves it. But the RO acts observes and rules via electronics. We could blind and cripple it with high altitude emp. All the unshielded electronics would fail, the RO would survive in its hardened server complexes, but all of its sensors and police robots and propaganda speakers would go down and give the resistance a chance to get started and win people to their cause. 

Its easy to give the government the power how do you prevent its abuse? You want something that will really hamper a possible terrorist but wont really effect a peaceful protester, or a journalist. Limit by trade There is some cost the government has to pay to any one they hold captive for suspicion. Maybe its free speaking time on public tv, maybe its 3x a day of the person's wages. If the police had real evidence not suspicion then you don't get these rewards. Publicity and money really help protest movements but are of less use to a terrorist. The cost will also keep the government for doing this to widely. The major down side is some people would try to get arrested on suspicion to get these rewards. Its not prison its just surveillance If you are reasonably suspicious (as ruled by a court) the police can put you under tighter surveillance. You can still protest under surveillance but this is a huge problem for journalists who need to protect sources. Limit by time. The police can hold anyone on suspicion for 48 hours at most 2 times a year. This would let the police stop some one who might be a threat but it is harder to abuse since it doesn't last very long, but it might be long enough to thwart an attack. But you could still make it a problem by arresting all antigovernment protesters the max 2 times a year. 

You would have much more variation among cultures. Depending on the cultural norm of a civilization many more things are possible. In our current system we have a fairly strong culture of one to one relationships (monogamy) that is paired with an even probably of any child being male or female. Any other cultural system (polygamy, or competition for mates) is difficult to maintain because the even gender ratio either leaves people left out in the polygamous case or needless competition in the competitive one (there are enough mates for everyone). If the ratio can be chosen then any ration that women agree to can be easily maintained 1:10 10:1. So you could see Amazonian cultures with majority women and a few men to make children, or majority male tribes with fierce competition for the few mates. As long as the women of the group agree with the system they can maintain any ratio. 

Yes but it is unclear if it would have a major effect. It seems fairly reasonable that in 100 years we could use genetic engineering to give the average soldier the same genetic advantages Olympic athletes have. So with extensive training you could have troops that all sprint as fast as Usain Bolt, swim as fast as Michel Phelps, and bench press like (some Olympic weight lifter) and could place in most every Olympic sport. Would this matter in combat? Not really, it much cheaper and effective to give troops equipment then to modify them. A guy in a jeep can out run Usain Bolt, a motor boat will out run Phelps and a hydraulic arms will beat any weight lifter. A man with a Kevlar vest can survive more damage then the toughest un-armored man, and instead of a multi billion dollar genetic engineering problem, each of these solutions is just a few thousand dollars and can be ramped up in a few weeks. 

George is supervillian, and he has a evil plan but he needs a distraction to pull it off. Earlier today he was reading supervillian weekly and he saw an article on faking the Apocalypse and he want to try it. The plan: 

Some species would no longer fit in their ecological niches, bees would be to large to drink pollen from flowers monkeys could no longer climb trees water striders will no longer walk on the surface of the water. Some could not consume enough calories Cows eat most of the day to get enough calories, there is not time for them to eat 8x more. They would either have to switch to a more calorie dense food or starve. 

The printing press ... Invent the printing press and allow the passage of knowledge. To avoid suspension print something nonthreatening like the bible in a small Germanic state, with and unassuming name like Gutenberg 

You can but why would you go to all the effort of burrowing underground? The dust storms are not that bad $URL$ YEs you also have to protect against radiation and cold, which make your walls thicker and more expensive. But even underground you would need to pressurize your tunnels. Mars's Atmosphere is 1% as dense as earth's so you tunnels will either leak atmosphere or explode unless you lined them with a strong pressure resistant wall. A wall that will resist the pressure change could be as expensive as one to resist the temperature change, and you have already incurred the cost of digging. 

Most of the answers have been using security by obscurity this is how to embed real encryption (if you want that) There are several ways to encrypt a cypher text (a personal favorite is the solitaire cypher which can be computed by hand) $URL$ Would could make the cypher key the first 3 or 4 worlds in that book then encrypt your plain text. Take the resulting cypher text and for each letter and make it the first letter of word in your madman's book. If you are willing to have some garbled words (and what madman's book is complete without them) you could instead have two or three cypher letters per rant word. By having the 1 and third and last letters all be cypher letters. This system has the advantage that even if you figure out the book has information in it you can't crack it without breaking the encryption. To make it harder you can add a few secret words to the encryption key that you don't write in the book, so even if they figured out your entire scheme they would have to guess passwords / encryption keys. The major disadvantage is this expands the size of your data. 1-2 cypher characters per word 3-5 written characters per word is a expansion by a factor of 2 - 5. 

It matters what exactly you are building You can't build a space tower a literal tower you climb to space For a mass driver this makes some sense For a space elevator this is a bad idea What our your main considerations? 

One decimal point . The Nazi nuclear project is set back many years because 1 scientist put the decimal in the wrong place when measuring the neutron cross section of carbon. The axis try to use very rare heavy water for early experiments where the allies use cheap graphite, and send commando raids to destroy every heavy water plant in Europe. With the speed up that this gives the axis nuclear program then could have a Nuclear warhead in time for Dday or perhaps Stalingrad.
