This a continuation of my first answer. I was trying to edit the previous one but the MathJax processing was freezing my computer. I suppose that answer was getting too long. @Darij: There has been lots of action on this question since I posted my first answer last night. Although, I must say, there has not been much reading of that answer ... ;) In your comments you raised two issues. Issue 1: how does FFT imply part b) of Schur-Weyl duality (the hard part)? My reply: The proof I gave does in one sweep, with no pause in between, the FFT for $SU(d)$ (and not $U(d)$ as in David's answer) and Schur-Weyl duality. But I could have written it in two steps. In this case the main protagonist $T$ would be an array with entries $$ T_{a_1\ldots a_p,i_1\ldots i_q} $$ corresponding to an invariant of $p$ vectors and $q$ covectors. After eliminating the matrix elements of $g^{-1}$ by Cramer's rule, one has a degree $p+q(d-1)=qd+p-q$ homogeneous polynomial in the entries of $g$ to be hit by a suitable power $r$ of ${\rm det}(\partial g)$. If $d$ does not divide $p-q$ then $T$ must vanish. Otherwise $r=q+\frac{p-q}{d}$ and at the end of the argument above using the elimination of $\epsilon$'s and $\tau$'s in pairs with the identity "${\rm det}(AB)={\rm det}(A){\rm det}(B)$", the number of $\epsilon$'s is $q$ while the number of $\tau$'s is $r$. 

This perhaps elaborates on Greg's answer regarding quantum field theory on the p-adics. One approach to studying "regular" quantum field theory over $\mathbb{R}^d$ is to consider probabilty measures on the space of fields $\phi:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. These are obtained as limits of Radon-Nikodym pertubations of better understood Gaussian measures. The mathematical analysis involved, typically based on rigorous renormalization group techniques, is very difficult. One can define analogous models over the p-adics where the fields $\phi$ become random generalized functions $\mathbb{Q}_p^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. There the analysis is much easier, and therefore the p-adic case is a good "toy model" for the real case. The idea is to develop one's tools and methods on the p-adics first, and then add the necessary refinements to handle the real case as a second step. Most of the core difficulties of the renormalization group analysis are already present in the p-adic toy model. However some features of the "regular" real case such as the flow of the wave function renormalization coupling are specific to the real case and therefore cannot be studied with this toy model. This being said I also believe such models over the p-adics are worthy of study per se and not just as toy models for "regular" QFT over the reals, in which I agree with Theo's comment above. 

I Don't have time for a very elaborate answer (will expand later), but I think the main research questions about Schwartz distribution relate to probability theory on spaces of such distributions. This is basically what quantum field theory is about. Some of the recent developments relate to probability measures on $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^d)$ obtained as scaling limits of discrete spin systems. See for example: $URL$ and $URL$ 

It seems to me the answer to: "Do physicists have some tools/ideas/techniques which allow them to make insights, which are not seen for mathematicians?" is indeed yes. Not only such a tool exists but, in my opinion, it is also unique: functional integrals. Predictions based on that tool are what mathematicians have a hard time reproducing and justifying using well-established rigorous theories. Imagine a world where we still would not know how to define an ordinary integral rigorously, e.g., via Riemann sums, but where physicists, engineers etc. use them on a daily basis and with great success. This would be quite similar to the situation today with the heuristic theory of functional integrals developed by physicists. Also, there is an area of mathematics which aims at constructing and studying these objects rigorously: constructive quantum field theory or rigorous renormalization group theory. 

I don't know if Poincaré proved PBW in 1900, but Alfredo Capelli did it for $\mathfrak{g}\mathfrak{l}_n$ ten years before. Here is the link to Capelli's paper (in French). 

Update: I recently came across this article by Alexander Schrijver "Tensor subalgebras and first fundamental theorems in invariant theory". J. Algebra 319 (2008), no. 3, 1305–1319. It is related to what I said above since it deduces the FFT for classical groups from that of $GL(n)$. 

A good reference, for practical purposes, is Section I.2 of the book "Functional Integration and Quantum Physics" by Barry Simon. 

There is a new book in five volumes by Barry Simon: "A Comprehensive Course in Analysis". The first volume, in particular, and maybe also the last one on spectral theory would be ideal references for the OP's topics. I looked at parts of this new series and I think it is really good. I like in particular Simon's "Kvetches" which I can paraphrase as stay away from non-Borel measurable functions or don't go too far from metrizable spaces. The chapter on wavelets is amazing (gives a construction of Meyer and Daubechies wavelets in less than thirty pages). 

Edit Jan 10, 2018: There is a flaw in the reasoning below as pointed out by Will. One needs more conditions on the combinatorial design like the only way to produce a pair partition of $[10]$ only using pairs in $\cup_i P_i$ is to take one the $P_i$'s. I don't know if this extra requirement can be satisfied. Perhaps a round robin tournament scheduling algorithm might work. 

Edit: Having thought about the question a bit more, I realized this is trivial (for the Veronese, but not for secants of general varieties as in the above articles) if one knows the symbolic method from 19th century invariant theory. Consider the secant $\sigma_r(v_d(\mathbb{P}^n))$ for the degree $d$ Veronese embedding. Let $C(F)$ be a homogeneous polynomial of degree $r$ in the coefficients of a generic form $F$ of degree $d$ in $n+1$ variables. If $C(F)=0$ for all $F$'s which can be written $F=L_1^d+\cdots +L_r^d$ for some linear forms $L_i$, then the polynomial $C$ vanishes identically. Indeed, $$ C(F)=\left.M(F_1,\ldots,F_r)\right|_{F_1=\cdots=F_r=F} $$ where $M$ is the associated symmetric multilinear form given by $$ M(F_1,\ldots,F_r)=\frac{1}{r!}\frac{\partial^r}{\partial t_1\cdots \partial t_r} \ C(t_1 F_1+\cdots+t_r F_r)\ . $$ From the hypothesis (and working over a field like $\mathbb{C}$ which contains $d$-th roots of unity) one immediately gets $$ M(L_1^d,\ldots,L_r^d)=0 $$ for linear all forms $L_1,\ldots,L_r$. Finally, one has the identity $$ C(F)=\frac{1}{d!^r}\ F(\frac{\partial}{\partial L_1})\cdots F(\frac{\partial}{\partial L_r})\ M(L_1^d,\ldots,L_r^d) $$ where the point coordinates $x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}$ are replaced by differential operators in the coefficients of the linear forms $L_1,\ldots,L_r$. As a result, $C(F)$ is identically zero. The last identity is what makes the classical symbolic method work. For more on this, please see this article (or here for the preprint version). 

Not a book but a great resource on the fractional Laplacian etc. is the Nonlocal Equation Wiki maintained by Luis Silvestre (I think). 

Edit: As I said, I did not have time to look at your coefficient closely yesterday but from the other answers it turns out you are dealing with a trivial $3j$ zero. In case you need more complicated analogues of your coefficients, I am giving more details and perspective. The Wigner $3jm$ symbol $$ \left(\begin{array}{ccc} j_1 & j_2 & J\\ m_1 & m_2 & m \end{array}\right) $$ is (up to trivial nonzero prefactors) the coefficient of $x_1^{j_1-m_1}x_2^{j_2-m_2}x_3^{J-m}$ in $$ (x_1-x_2)^{j_1+j_2-J}(x_2-x_3)^{J+j_2-j_1}(x_3-x_1)^{J+j_1-j_2}\ . $$ Therefore your coefficient is $$ \left(\begin{array}{ccc} a+c+1 & a+b+1 & b+c+1\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right)\ . $$ If you look up page 2611 of the article by Raynal, Van der Jeugt, Srinivasa Rao and Rajeswari, that we cited in my article mentioned above, you will see that your case (with all magnetic moments $m$ begin zero) is a trivial zero because the sum of the numbers on top is odd. If the sum is even the result is nonzero and this is basically Dixon's Theorem for ${}_3F_2$ series. You can find many more details on $3j$, $6j$, $9j$ symbols with precise signs, prefactors and all that in my other article with Chipalkatti "The higher transvectants are redundant". BTW, I just looked up citations to the Raynal et al. article, and there does not seem to have been much progress on understanding the zeros of $3jm$ coefficients.
