My father worked in Lesotho from 1975 until the mid 1980s. I attended a boarding school in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State from 1975 - 1977 (after which I transferred back to a boarding school in the UK. I returned to Lesotho for the holidays, and between 1975 and 1979 I visited all of the provinces of South Africa. So here are my observations, for what they are worth. My experience was that the state of the infrastructure was comparable to that in the UK at that time (in some ways it was better, given the strikes that impacted services in the UK in the mid 1970s). Metalled roads were kept in good repair, and even dirt-roads were maintained to a standard that allowed a normal family saloon to use them without risk (with the possible exception of the rainy season in some parts of the country!). As far as I could see, education was also excellent - provided, of course that you were white. Education for other groups was less great, as you can probably imagine. However, I played rugby against school teams from other parts of the country and the facilities at all the schools (for white kids) we visited seemed to be uniformly very good. Crime rates were certainly low while I was there. Car-jackings were almost unheard of, and serious crimes like rape and murder were rare. But then again, I'm white, and I lived in areas where most residents were also white. I rarely had much contact with the police, but again, I'm white (and I have a British passport - which really helped on a few occasions), so my experience was mostly positive. The police that enforced the Pass Laws (the laws that enforced segregation under Apartheid) certainly weren't the brightest people I've ever met, but I also never personally witnessed any instance of abuse or corruption. I returned to the UK permanently in 1979, so I have only anecdotal evidence of what happened since, but friends do say that things have got a lot worse, so it's possible that your vlogger is right. But perhaps black South Africans would have a different perspective ... 

These events were recorded by Cassius Dio, and that, combined with other epigraphic evidence (discussed in the paper by Rolandi et al cited above), suggest that the coin should not have been struck until after 8 September 79 AD. 

So, to answer your question, most of the claims listed on those pages to titles in places where Spain no longer rules or which no longer exist rest on hereditary claims on the basis that those titles were previously held by either the ruler of Spain or the ruler of the Spanish Empire. Although they are titles in pretence, their use was nevertheless permitted under the Spanish Constitution of 1978. For the rest, including the Hungarian Crown of St Stephen, there seems to be no evidence to support the assertion that the Kings of Spain have any claim to those titles (even a claim to a title in pretence). 

(quoted in What Was the UK GDP Then? A Data Study p34) The East India Company Act 1813 opened up trade with India, but reserved commerce with China to the Honourable East India Company. The quantity of tea exported from the port of Canton by the East India Company in 1825/26 was 27,821,121 lbs. That was valued at £1,729,949 [Papers Relating to the Trade with India and China, p 47]. Since we already know that most of the money needed to buy tea in China in 1825 was raised by the illegal opium trade (see above), this also gives us a rough figure for the East India Company's revenue from the opium trade. If we assume a roughly linear growth in GDP, then, based on the estimates above, the GDP of the British Empire in 1825 would have been something between £316 million and £420 million. Assuming the mean value of £360 million, then the value of the opium trade was just under 0.5% of the GDP of the British empire in 1825. 

There is an interesting article, Public Voting: Before the Secret Ballot, from The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia. It discusses the various methods of voting used in the United States before the secret ballot was adopted in the later nineteenth century. 

The main reason that the troops of the Union army objected to Lincoln's sacking of McClellan was that the sacking appeared to be a political, rather than a military, decision. Soldiers, then as now, often resented interference from politicians who did not share their experience of the actual events in battle. They had fought at Antietam, and many presumably shared McClellan's caution in the aftermath. I found the following contemporary quotes in the recent book, McClellan and the Union High Command, 1861–1863: Leadership Gaps That Cost a Timely Victory, by Jeffrey W. Green: General George Meade noted that McClellan was sacked after the New York election: 

The historian Victor Duruy, writing in the late 19th century, believed that Zenobia used the Greek version of her name in deference to her Greek subjects. She certainly adopted Greek versions of titles in some of her inscriptions. An inscription on one of Zenobia's statues recorded her name as "Septimia Bat-Zabbai, daughter of Antiochus". "Zenobia" is the feminine form of Zabbai when written in Greek. A slightly later inscription (dated c271 AD) includes the title "Sebaste", the Greek equivalent of "Empress" (the Latin would be "Augusta"). Another, with a dedication stating that the statue was raised by two senior army commanders, describes her as the "most illustrious and pious queen". Coins dated to the following year (272AD) carry her prtrait and the the title "AVG" for "Augusta". 

So it seems clear that the church's attitude to magic, as expressed in its early decrees, and later in canon law, was a highly negative one. 

After the 1763 Treaty of Paris, which marked the end of the Seven Years' War, Britain gained control of most of New France, and also gained Florida from Spain. This meant they now controlled all of North America east of the Mississippi, and the question of the formerly disputed border became moot. In fact, the first British Surveyor General of Quebec, Samuel Holland, had actually proposed a survey of all the British territories in North America in 1762 - the year before the Treaty of Paris was signed. This survey was eventually to be approved in 1764, an it was as a result of this survey that the boundary between Quebec and New York was formally established along the 45th Parallel. 

The reference to the horse of Ramses II is, of course, in the Egyptian record of the Battle of Kadesh which is usually dated to 1274 BCE. 

Sandy Ware is a type of medieval (and earlier) pottery with enough quartz sand mixed in with the clay for it to be visible in the fabric of the pot. The sand acted as a temper which helped bind the clay together, and keep the finished pot from cracking while being dried and subsequently fired. Examples are found across the UK, and have different chronologies in different part of the country. If you are particularly interested in medieval pottery, and want to learn more, the Medieval Pottery Research Group website has some useful links and a bibliography that should get you started. The Portable Antiquities Scheme is a project to encourage the voluntary recording of archaeological objects found by members of the public in England and Wales. Because the focus is on small finds reported by the public, there is a bit of a bias towards metalwork (for example this Roman brooch*), but bits of flint (for example this gun flint), pottery, etc. that someone finds "interesting" are also reported and recorded. There are currently some 335 pieces of Sandy Ware on the database. Archaeologists are fond of using the term "-ware" to differentiate between different pottery types. In London, we also get a type of pottery known as "Shelly-Sandy Ware" which - as you've probably already guessed - used both sand and ground-up shell as temper. 

The Decline of the Highland Chief in the Aftermath of Culloden The 1689 Jacobite Rising was just the first of many attempts to restore the line of James II and VII to the throne. Most of the clan chiefs remained loyal to the Jacobite cause throughout. These were the clans that would suffer most in the immediate aftermath of Culloden. Following the 1745 uprising, rebel Highland chiefs were stripped of their lands. This wasn't unusual. The confiscation of lands belonging to those judged to be rebels or traitors was normal practice. The chiefs who had remained loyal to the government were rewarded for their loyalty. Again, this was nothing unusual. What was new was the methodical dismantling of the Highland culture that followed. The British government passed a series of acts intended to "modernise" the Scottish highlands and integrate them with the rest of Great Britain. In 1746, the government passed the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746. This removed most of the traditional military and judicial rights of the Clan Chiefs. Alongside this, parliament passed the Act of Proscription of 1746 which reiterated and expanded the earlier Disarming Act of 1716. This was the act that banned highland dress and allowed government troops to forcibly disarm highlanders without fear of prosecution. In effect, these measures reduced the status of the clan chiefs to that of mere landlords and the men and women of their clans became simply tenants. The bonds of loyalty between the clan and the chief were being broken. Power was increasingly to be measured by wealth, rather than by the number of men who followed the chief. 

More generally, the scholarly consensus is the so-called Conventional Egyptian chronology. There are some problems with the conventional chronology, however. Most of these are relatively minor, but the source of a lot of scholarly debate. There are also a number of alternative chronologies, intended to solve specific problems with the conventional chronology. However, to date, none of these have been widely accepted. The Wikipedia article provides a good overview. 

Here is the Congressional Record, Volume 57, Pt 1, that includes the records for Dec 3 1918. The resolution that you're looking for (S Con Res. 26) can be found on page 23. For an explanation of "Over, under the rule", the US Government Publishing office has this to say. (Which, frankly, is about as clear as mud). 

The authors then analysed samples from later burial layers. Although the dominant haplogroup was again haplogroup C, the evidence: 

The author further describes some unsuccessful attempts to determine the chemical composition of the inks. 

In 1850, Dr Smith entered into a contract with the city for the care of its "indigent sick". For this he was to be paid the sum of $4 per patient per day. This was to be paid in scrip, which could be redeemed later at an interest rate of 3% [Soulé et al, 1855, p370]. Dr Smith's hospital stood next to a "famed bordello" [Lavender, 1987, 220]. On 31 October 1850 a fire at the bordello (believed to have been started deliberately) spread to the adjacent hospital. Some 150 patients were rescued, but the hospital was destroyed and Smith suffered a personal financial loss of between $40,000 and $80,000 [Durham, 1997, 178] (depending which accounts you read). Either way, this was a significant loss, and - at best - would have accounted for almost two-thirds of the amount owed to him by the city. This seems to have been the event that led him to sue the city of San Francisco for the money that he was owed. The city didn't have sufficient funds in its exchequer, and had to sell large tracts of land to settle the debt. That sale was mishandled, and much of that land sold for much less than it was actually worth. He received the first part of the money owed ($19,239) in February 1851, and the balance ($45,538) later that year. Some of the balance seems to have been paid in the form of 75 of the lots being sold by the city. It appears that Smith sold many (perhaps all) of these lots on to other investors almost immediately. So, allowing for his losses in the fire, and his expenses while recouping what he was owed by the city, he was hardly walking away with a fortune in his pocket. (The same could certainly not be said of many of those who purchased the land from the city!) 

"Dollheart" is the English translation of the French "Cœur de poupée". This was indeed one of the nicknames of King John, and the poupée in this context does refer to the children's toy or puppet. As with most nicknames, we will probably never know who coined it, but according to Jacques Choffel, in the epilogue to his biography of John's older brother King Richard I, Richard Coeur de Lion it was used by his contemporaries to compare him unfavourably with his brother: 

There is no doubt that opium and tea formed a "commercial nexus" that became an essential element of the British imperial economy. Although the British government wasn't directly involved in the opium trade, import duties on tea provided 10% of British tax income. Sales of opium generated about one seventh of the revenues of the British East India Company in India [Robins, 2012, p156], and those revenues were used to pay for the tea that was sent back to Britain. The table below shows the opium exports from India to China (in chests): 

On 23 September, he wrote to Thomas Ewing, Secretary to the Treasury, from Tremont Illinois to advise him that: 

Furthermore, in his trial against Verres in 70 BC, Cicero called several women as witnesses. In his speech, he shamed Verres for having forced him to compel respectable women to appear in court to testify against him. Cicero's objection here is clearly against disturbing women of station, and not against trusting their testimony, otherwise why would he have called them as witnesses? 

Now we come to the crunch. In his Phillipics, Cicero claims that "Antony was as much the cause of the civil war, as Helen was of the Trojan". The implication is clear, and it was an attack on both Mark Antony and Julius Caesar. Plutarch repeats Cicero's statement in his Life of Antony: 

Just to clarify definitions, phonograms are symbols that are used to represent sounds. Ideograms are symbols used to represents objects or concepts. The ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic alphabet seems to have included both phonograms and ideograms from the very beginning, somewhere between 3300 and 3200BC. Words are often constructed using phonograms at the beginning of the word, followed by an ideogram (which we call the "determinative" of the word). The ancient Egyptian phonograms only represented the sounds of consonants (singly or in combination). They didn't write vowels, which is why - in most cases - we actually do not know how they pronounced words. There are quite a number of words which, when written in phonograms, look identical (although the determinative allows us to distinguish between them). It may be that in many, perhaps most, of these cases, the ancient Egyptians used different vowel sounds so that the the words were actually pronounced quite differently. The ancient Egyptian language was written in three scripts:
