I'm running disc brakes on my cyclocross bike with semi-metallic brake pads. I find that I'm constantly having to keep my rotors cleaned off to ensure optimal performance. I'm used to my mountain bike which uses sintered metal pads, and still works well in muddy / dirty conditions without needing excess maintenance. I considered buying new brake pads and swapping them out. However, If I do that, will the new metallic pads work well with the rotor that has been bed-in using the semi-metallic (part resin) pad? Do I need to get new rotors or do anything to bed in the rotors again with new pads? Would it be any different swapping from sintered to resin based pads? 

Look at Downhill MTB gloves, they are meant for folks who are likely to crash in the brush and often have padding on fronts of fingers and knuckles and leather palm protection. 

Why do you wear chainrings quickly? Cross Chaining - If you tend to be in the big ring on the back and the big ring on the front at the same time, you're probably doing it wrong. Same with running the small ring on the front with the small ring on the back. This can cause uneven wear on the front chainrings due to the awkward angles the chain must bend. This can wear the sides of the front chainring teeth and make them more pointy. You are riding dirty or don't lube up first- If you ride offroad especially, your chain can get dirty. If your chain is not lubed properly, it can cause extra friction. Keep the chain clean or it will work like sandpaper, wearing down your chainrings and make sure you use the proper type of lube for your environment. Chain wear tends to deform the inside surface of the gap between teeth, making an uneven 'U' shape between teeth. Riding with an already "stretched" chain - If your chain is worn, It has a different shape, which is going to cause extra wear on your chainrings. If it's worn too much, you can only really replace it. Running with a "stretched" chain is probably worse than running with a worn chainring. If it's a pretty new bike and the chain is well maintained, I'd probably blame it on cross chaining. Be aware of your riding style and make sure you're not overextending the range of your front chainrings. 

Many ulock manufacturers have a unique serial number or key code to make keys for your lock. You can often register your keys with the company or simply request duplicates from them. There typically is a charge. Kryptonite puts the key code on the key, on guard gives you a key code card with the box, other manufacturers vary. On guard lock registration Kryptonite key order page Also, I found Lokitt which offers key duplication services for ABUS/On Guard/Mul-T-Lock keys. They can make keys with key code or they can duplicate from an existing key.

You will probably want to try to use these with V-Brake compatible drop bar levers (long pull) as opposed to standard drop bar levers used with caliper or canti brakes (short pull). One product that comes to mind is a Tektro RL520. I don't think it's advisable to use with an integrated brake/shifter setup (Shimano STI / SRAM Doubletap Shifters / Campagnolo Ergo Shifters). You may want to consider using bar end or downtube shifters, if you're not using an Internally Geared Hub. 

Are there LED based dynamo powered lights suitable for night time MTB riding on singletrack? Likely they would need to have: High Brightness, likely 500 lumens or better. Not sure how that translates to LUX used for most dynamo light ratings. Standlight Mode providing several minutes of light while stopped Be able to produce a relatively consistent output with varying levels of speed. Weather resistsant to handle wet / muddy conditions I'm currently using a battery system, but I'm looking for a non-battery alternative that will handle extended night time use without recharging for events such as 24 hour races and off road tours where I might not have a power source to charge lights. 

You would need a new fork in the front to add v-brake bosses and the frame does not support this either. I don't think it's worth the effort on this bike. It's sure not going to be easy without replacing both fork and frame. I think for your situation, what may be a better solution is to switch to Mechanical Disc Brakes. They are much more field serviceable than hydraulics. I'm going to recommend avid BB7 brakes since they are easy to adjust (you can adjust pad position on either side of the brake) and very easy to find parts for (most shops are going to have pads). 

I suffered from foggy glasses a lot, I prefer to wear clear lenses since I tend to ride after dark frequently. I tried a few of different cycling glasses with clear lenses, eyeglasses with anti-fog coating, motorcycle goggles, and several pairs of safety glasses with no luck. I finally found a pair of $9 MSA Safety Works safety goggles with anti fog coating that work well, don't fog easily, and have good peripheral coverage without obscuring my vision. They sit far enough off my face that they prevent fog when I'm stopped. So far this has been the best alternative to bulky ski goggles that I've used. $URL$ One of the biggest things you can do for any glasses to prevent fog is to keep them clean and free of sweat, oil, and residue. I don't know if this is the best method, but i tend to just clean my glasses with a touch of dish soap and rinse well. Don't use harsh cleaners like windex or alcohol which may strip the anti-scratch and anti-fog coatings. Also, do your best to avoid scratching your glasses, as this will make it harder to see and often can causes refraction when looking at light sources. I keep a glasses case in my bag for storage when not in use. 

I'm trying to buy a front wheel which will work with both disc and rim brakes so that I can use it on my cross bike (with rim brakes) and my mountain bike (with disc brakes) with a dynamo hub to power lights for night riding. Can I use a disc rim with rim brakes (cantilever or caliper) or will I need to buy a wheel that does not have a disc specific rim? 

Most 26x1.25 sized tubes are rated from 1.25" up to 1.5". You should be fine with the 26x1.25 tube as long as that's the lowest size indication on the tube. Though most tubes you'll find will indicate an acceptable low/high range. You're likely to find the tubes indicated as 26x1.25/1.5 which should fit any sizes listed or between. 

I put a new chain on my bike and after 3 rides or so, I developed a stiff link. I'm not sure what caused the issue, but now it barely bends at the pin at all, unless forced. It causes skipping problems when it goes through the derailleur. I've tried scrubbing it and applying lube to the link that is stuck, but that hasn't had any effect. It's a 10 speed chain, so I'm wary about trying to just remove the link, since these chains are not as easy to reconnect and I need to keep the chain long to work well with the wide range 3x10 MTB drivetrain. Is there any way to fix this stuck link? 

I have an older Salsa El Mariachi with a Bushnell eccentric bottom bracket with 54mm O.D. Do I have any options to replace the EBB with a non-eccentric bottom bracket? The current bottom bracket has threaded openings to accept a standard 68mm English thread BB, currently running a standard GXP bottom bracket and crankset in the Bushnell EBB. 

My bike is setup for cable routing under the downtube. I would like to route my rear brake, front derailleur, and rear derailleur cables along the top tube of a bike I plan to use for cyclocross to prevent the exposed cables from getting gunked up frequently with mud or snagged on things when I'm riding through brush in the woods (really bad in the spring / early summer). Reduced maintinance is my goal, I'm willing to take the weight penalty for that since I'm ultimately not ever standing on a podium. I'd prefer not to use complete housing over the whole top tube, but I'll accept that I'll need to do that and use 6 cable clips (3 in front, and 3 in rear) if there are no better options. So, I figure I need two things. 1) Something to keep cables on the top tube. 2) A clamp on cable stop to help terminate the brake cable on the seat tube for the front shifter (I've got a mountain derailleur which goes top or bottom pull) I've seen a 2 cable clamp on solution for 2 cables, the problem solvers backstop, but that doesn't work for 3 cables. What are my options here? 

It will help 2x, though 1x is going to hold chain better. I think you'll still see an improvement with a 2x setup due to added chain tension. When I upgraded the drivetrain on my full suspension to use a 10spd Shimano Deore clutch derailleur it didn't drop chain nearly as much if ever. Make sure you have your chain shortened to the appropriate length as that's one of the biggest factors causing chain slap and jumps is having a chain that's too long. A 1x would likely work better if you switched to a narrow/wide chainring that prevents jumps though. I almost never drop a chain on the 1x setup with a race face narrow wide ring. The front chainring does a lot to stop the chain from slipping off due to the tooth profiles that really keep the chain engaged. I'm running a cheaper 10 speed setup on my hardtail with a sunrace 11-42 casette with a 10spd sram x-9 clutch derailleur and it works very well and was a cheap upgrade vs a whole new 11spd. 

buy cases of beer with the cardboard dividers between the bottles. You can then re-use the cardboard dividers in other cases of beer. 

Sometimes it can be hard to find a small hole. Sometimes it helps to mix water and dish soap together and either pour that over the partially inflated tire, scanning for leaks or submerging the tire in a bucket of soapy water. The soap will bubble and make holes more apparent. You also probably want to immerse the valve to see if the leak may be originating from there. If the problem is coming from the valve, then you will want to go ahead and just replace the tube. 

I've got a pugsly setup as tubeless, running endomorph tires, typically I run between 8 and 12 PSI in the tires depending on the conditions. Is there a significant difference between performance of presta vs schrader valves at these low pressures? 

If you have a singlespeed, you may already have a flip flop hub. A flip flop hub has threads on both sides of the wheel. Typically there is a side for a freewheel and a side for a fixed gear. Take a look at the rear hub opposite the freewheel and chain. The fixed gear side will have two tiers of threads, one larger diameter section for a fixed cog and a smaller diameter section for a lock ring which is reverse threaded. You need to thread on the fixed cog clockwise, then thread on the lockring counterclockwise. You do not want to attempt to put a fixed cog on the same side as the freewheel if it does not have the reverse threading for a lock ring. This is known as a suicide fixed cog because you can't put a standard fixed cog lockring on and would have to use a lockring from a bottom bracket typically to prevent the fixed cog from loosening when backpedaling or skidding. Over time this can come loose and cause you to loose the ability to brake with the back wheel as the cog will unthread as you backpedal. You can however thread a freewheel on to the fixed side of a hub with no real issues. This would thread on clockwise like the fixed cog. No lockring would be used. This can be common when using fixed / fixed hubs which are threaded for a fixed cog and lock ring on both sides. 

I typically buy tubes with removable valve cores (Qtubes brand typically) and I have some stans leftover from a tubeless tire setup for my mountain bike. Would adding Stans to the tubes on my commuter bike help prevent flats? Or would this cause more problems than it's worth? 

I have been using the dishwasher for my bottles more regularly since I started using powdered drink mixes, which leave a lot of residue in my bottles that's harder to clean out by hand than when I was only using electrolytes or just water. Will putting bicycle bottles in dishwasher damage them? I've been noticing a distinct plastic taste on my bottles as of late.
