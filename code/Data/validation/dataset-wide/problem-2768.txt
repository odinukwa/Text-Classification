I like @labreuer's answer, but I'd still like to add another point of view. From the perspective of social epistemology, scientific research is a deeply collaborative, socially organized activity. So it can be misleading to attribute the development of theories to individual scientists. Instead, social epistemology directs our attention to the social processes and scientific institutions that produced the new theories. Regarding relativity, note first that neither Poincaré nor Einstein were conducting experiments and gathering data. The Michelson-Morley experiments provided important anomalies (in the Kuhnian sense, roughly "phenomena that didn't fit Maxwellian ether theory"; see Collins and Pinch's The Golem for a discussion of the complex social construction of the Michelson-Morley experiments as anomalies). Second, neither Poincaré nor Einstein developed relativity ex nihilo. Numerous other theoretical physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers contributed ideas that were wrapped into relativity — Lorentz, Mach, Riemann, Leibniz, Kant — and the idea that measurements are relative to the observer goes back at least as far as Galileo. From a social epistemology perspective, relativity was developed in the scholarly interactions between these theoreticians, experimentalists, mathematicians, and philosophers; it did not spring fully-formed from the brain of one or more individual geniuses. We can more-or-less characterize the contributions of individuals to this overall achievement of developing relativity; but from this social epistemology perspective it's a mistake to say that one individual's contributions mark a strict division between relativity and its forerunners. 

Eric Schwitzgebel, who works on philosophy of mind and other things at UC Riverside, has written several blog posts over the last few months on undergraduate majors in philosophy at US institutions. 

The figure shows the relative number of bachelor's degrees (as a percentage of all bachelor's degrees) that go to philosophy majors, each year from 1987-2016. The trend is basically flat through the 1990s. There's a substantial increase in 2000-2005; another flat period in 2005-2010; and a drop from 2010 to 2016. In 2016, the relative number of philosophy majors is about the same as where it was in the 1990s. In the "Double Majors" post (the last in the list), Schwitzgebel looks into a hypothesis that trends against double majors are contributing to this decline. For example, many schools are putting more emphasis on completing a degree in 4 years, which makes it harder to major in both, say, biology and philosophy. Schwitzgebel does find that schools that encourage/enable double majors have more philosophy majors, and so double majors are very important for philosophy. But decreases in double majors don't seem to explain much of the decrease in philosophy majors. When I was on the regular academic philosophy career track, I often suggested that philosophy programs should create second major programs, with specialized cross-disciplinary curricula in topics such as medical ethics or philosophy of science and technology. A lot of STEM majors want a humanities experience as well, but don't have time for a full second major. This approach probably wouldn't address the causes of the recent decline; but it might help mitigate them. 

The effects of our actions will generally not be causes of our actions; effects aren't characteristic of living beings; aren't subjects of emotional states; aren't generally responsible for planning and practical thinking; and don't bear virtues such as courage or justice. (An action might be called courageous or just, but I don't think we would typically say that the effects are courageous or just.) So it seems like your suggested definition is at least highly revisionist. 

First, there's an article on measurement in science in the Stanford Encyclopedia. The sociologist Harry Collins dubbed this problem "the experimenter's regress" in the 1980s. There's a brief discussion in this Stanford Encyclopedia article; for more detail, see his book Changing Order, especially chapters 4 and 5. More recently, the historian and philosopher of science Hasok Chang has written a detailed analysis of the invention of the thermometer, in his book Inventing Temperature. Briefly, Collins gives a social constructivist/anti-epistemological answer, while Chang's is closer to contemporary social epistemology. (This isn't surprising given the respective times their books were written.) Specifically, Collins points to the internal politics of science, emphasizing how proponents of one approach will recruit allies and marginalize their critics. Chang looks at critical interactions between scientists as more or less epistemically productive debates, which are settled by a complex mix of the better argument winning the day and the kinds of political factors that Collins points to. (Consider how the better argument can win the day by marginalizing people who stick to the worse argument.) 

Asking research questions Designing studies to address those questions Analyzing and interpreting data gathered from those studies Combining findings from several studies to formulate answers to the research questions 

At least in Western philosophy, souls are usually understood as being causes of the agent's behavior. There's disagreement on the kind of cause — for Aristotle the soul was a formal and final cause; for Descartes it was supposed to be an efficient cause — but it was still a cause of behavior. For example, this Stanford Encyclopedia article glosses classical Greek theories of soul as generally sharing these assumptions: 

It's controversial whether self-ownership implies that you have the right to sell yourself into slavery. Usually this possibility is treated as an objection to libertarianism. (Search in the SEPh article for "voluntary enslavement.") I seem to recall that Nozick had some cryptic remarks in Anarchy, State, and Utopia that suggest but don't state outright that you do have the right to sell yourself into slavery. Libertarians generally agree that prostitution is morally permissible and should be legal. Two non-libertarian discussions of self-ownership are worth mentioning. In the introduction to Self-ownership, Freedom, and Equality, G.A. Cohen observes that self-ownership seems to be a central commitment of both libertarianism and the kind of Marxism he was raised with in working-class Montréal. Over the course of the book, he critically engages with Robert Nozick's version of libertarianism, and ultimately rejects self-ownership. In Justice, Gender, and the Family, Susan Moller Okin presents a deep feminist critique of libertarianism. Okin's argument has been neglected in the literature; I wrote a comprehensive review of replies to Okin, with responses to those replies a few years ago. (I discussed every reply to Okin that I could find, except for one very technical reply that had to be cut due to word limits.) Specifically, I argued that Okin's argument creates a fundamental dilemma for libertarianism: either people do not own themselves or justice requires at least some involuntary transfers of property. 

Non-Overlapping Magisteria, or NOMA. The term comes from a Stephen Jay Gould essay, and his book Rock of Ages. The basic idea is that science and religion have different spheres, topics, or domains — the "magisteria" — and that these domains don't overlap. The purpose of science is to describe the observable, natural world; the purpose of religion is to provide moral guidance on how we live our lives; and the two domains are logically irrelevant to each other, so that claims in one domain simply can't conflict with claims in the other. (More on Wikipedia.) Constructive empiricism and other varieties of scientific anti-realism. Constructive empiricism comes from philosopher of science Bas van Fraassen, who is Catholic. On van Fraassen's view, scientific models don't need to be literally true; instead, they only need to accurately represent the parts of the world that we can observe. (More on the Stanford Encyclopedia.) Then, if we understand the long history of life as something that we can't observe, models of evolution by natural selection don't need to be literally true about that history. Instead, they only need to accurately represent the parts of the history of life that we can observe. (To be clear, I don't think van Fraassen himself would endorse this argument, because I think he would say that this history is something that we could observe in principle. My point here is that someone could avoid conflict between religion and science by taking this kind of approach.) The Doctrine of Two Books was important in medieval and Renaissance Christianity. (I learned about it writing a paper on Galileo as an undergraduate, and it's also relevant to understanding how Aquinas reconciled Christianity with Aristotle's more "naturalistic" philosophy.) The idea here is that God has "written" two books, Scripture and Nature, and that humans are called to study and learn from both books. So far this might sound like NOMA. The key difference is that, according to the doctrine, the two books are relevant to each other, and cannot conflict. Apparent conflicts are the product of limited human understanding, and so reconciling the apparent conflicts is an important task for scholars of both books. Importantly, the books don't relate to each other hierarchically. It's not that Scripture takes priority over Nature. A theologian's understanding of Scripture should be informed by a scientific understanding of Nature, and a scientist's understanding of Nature should be informed by a theological understanding of Scripture. Both theologians and scientists are working to understand God's two books, and they should work together. I believe something like this is the position of the Catholic Church today. Of course, all of this assumes that Scripture is a reliable source of knowledge — though your question more or less assumes a religious scientist. (I haven't been able to find a good source of more information. This Wikipedia article goes into a little more detail, but is incomplete and messy. This essay by Ernan McMullin, a philosopher of physics and Catholic priest, works through a highly qualified version of this strategy. McMullin's essay was also published in this anthology.) Another strategy is to offer what I've heard called a guided interpretation of evolution. The basic idea is that God sets up evolutionary scenarios that, as a result of the operation of natural selection and other evolutionary forces, produce the results that God desires. One way to think about this is that, using divine foreknowledge, the Big Bang was configured precisely to result in humans here on Earth (or whatever the desired goal happens to be). Another, somewhat different idea is that God has occasionally (or maybe more often) "nudged" history — killing off this organism, ensuring that this other one survives and reproduces — to result in humans here on Earth (or whatever the desired goal happens to be). I believe something like this was the view of Asa Gray, a botanist who corresponded with Darwin. (There are some scattered remarks on Gray in the Stanford Encylopedia entry.) The final argument strategy that I'll discuss here is to understand scientific naturalism as methodological naturalism rather than ontological naturalism. Roughly the idea is that science proceeds under the assumptions of naturalism (that there are no supernatural entities or causal influences, that the only forms of causation are efficient-material, that observation provides the only way of gaining knowledge about natural causal relations, and so on), but that there's no deep commitment to these assumptions being true. From a methodological naturalist perspective, there might very well be supernatural stuff; but the assumption is that any supernatural stuff that might exist can be ignored for the purposes of investigating the natural stuff. Somewhat like NOMA, methodological naturalism regards religion as a "separate domain"; but it allows for the possibility that this domain is about much more than just morality. Unlike scientific anti-realism, methodological naturalism is compatible with scientific claims being true — so long as they're understood to be true about nature and not "supernature." (This Stanford Encyclopedia entry is mostly about naturalism and philosophy, but in many places the discussion of methodological naturalism also applies to science.)
