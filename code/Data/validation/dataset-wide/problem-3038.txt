the only references to a similar title I can find hint at it being the Chief State Arbiter. Being a civilian position (wikipedia ($URL$ lists the post in conjunction with constitutional changes only), there would be unlikely to be a uniform associated with the role (though of course in the USSR many civic officials, especially high ones, did have high military of KGB rank as well (often general or marshal level ranks), sometimes ceremonial, sometimes actual, and would occasionally wear that uniform). $URL$ also mentions the role, with the "deputy chief state arbiter" nullifying a law in 1992. $URL$ lists the position as being a political appointment by the congress of peoples' deputees in 1988, in the same sentence as talking about the chairman of the supreme soviet, again indicating a civilian level position. 

technically, D-day WAS plan B. The invasion plans called for the invasion to happen on 5 June, not 6 June, but were postponed because of bad weather. Had it failed that day (I think the 7th was also an option), a wait of at least a month was have been called for to get the correct conditions again, and that was considered to be too long to remain operational security, effectively meaning there'd be no invasion in Normandy, would be too risky. 

BACKGROUND In fall of 1187 Saladin's "12,000 professional cavalrymen [and] 30,000 volunteers" arrived at Jerusalem and began a two week siege, assaulting the walls with towers, arrows, rocks, and greek fire. During the first five days of the siege he attacked the walls around the western wall, from the Tower of David and Damascus Gate. After failing there he moved to the northern wall, where he finally breached the city and obtained a surrender. Accounts of the siege don't tell us what formations Saladin used to attack the walls, which is unfortunately exactly what I want to know. My first thought was that I could make a reasonable guess from accounts of another siege he led in 1188, where his "soldiers advanced in waves establishing a shield wall [...] behind which their archers and crossbowmen kept up repeated volleys of arrows [and then the] assault troops [...] storm[ed] the walls with scaling ladders and ropes." Saladin's army attacked in multiple divisions over the course of the day. This seems plausible (though if you think it's not then this question changes to why and what is). But even so, it still leaves one big question to my mind. 

I am skeptical about the author's reasoning for it not being used on the western front, but his reasoning to arrive at the conclusion that Uranium penetrators were created by the Germans is sound based on my knowledge of the chemical and mechanical properties of the metal and its modern use in these applications. 

As to manpower and strategic resources, the V1 especially was dirt cheap to manufacture, and deployment was relatively simple as well so not much crew training was needed either. Perfect weapon for a late war campaign. The V2 was more questionable in that regard, but had its place. A far greater drain on German resources was the great variety of expensive aircraft and super heavy tanks that were being prototyped when those same people and materials could have been much more effectively used to produce larger numbers of Panzer IV and VI models, and more StuGs and JagdPanzer IVs, which might have delayed the Soviets and western allies a bit longer. 

Not all rowers were slaves, free men would be unlikely to be chained to their oars. Galley slavery was the harshest form of slavery a man could face, apart from maybe some mines, and could thus have been a form of punishment for those guilty of serious crimes just short of warranting execution (though I'd guess many would wish they were executed after some time on the oars). 

This question is pretty straightforward. While looking into Victorian British beliefs about Americans and American history I began to wonder about European attitudes toward American Indians; and more specifically their reaction to the human atrocity that was the Indian Removal Act and The Trail of Tears. I quickly learned that Tocqueville glimpsed the start of it, and that while he was distressed by the expulsion he wrote it had been done "tranquilly, legally, philanthropically, without spilling blood, without violating a single one of the great principles of morality in the eyes of the world.‚Äù This implies there was no reaction overseas, which is a little hard for me to believe. That's not because I have a high opinion of human nature, but rather because I've observed that competing nations are generally very quick to point out each other's faults. (Just as the British, for example, were quick to criticize the hypocrisy of American slavery, and the Americans were quick to attack British colonialism.) So I thought it might be productive to ask the following here: Was there a roughly contemporary European response to the Trail of Tears and the removal of the American Indians? Whether in politics, journalism, literature, or elsewhere. As a side note, I'm using the phrase Trail of Tears in the loose sense, as shorthand for the many relocations that took place during the period. 

I seriously doubt you're going to find a publication from the era written by the local equivalent of Al Gore complaining about how the clearing of the forests to make new farmland is causing global warming... And yes, that's tongue in cheek but it's also quite real. There's simply not going to be any period publications stating that they cleared the forests because temperatures were now high enough to make living in those areas possible. So you have to go on what you already know: temperatures went up, allowing farming to extend further north, and this coincided with reduction in forests at those latitudes. So either people cleared those forests for farmland, or they disappeared on their own and the now available land was turned into farmland. Take your pick (remembering that if grain and other food crops can grow better, so can trees, so why would the trees disappear on their own). 

Interestingly, $URL$ does talk about a supreme state arbiter elected in 1990, so maybe the title changed. But again indicates effectively a civilian rather than military position, which would not be uniformed. 

Background: My summer reading goal is to get a handle on Europe from 1850-1914, with a strong focus on the British Empire, and within that a focus on England. So far, I've seen multiple historians single out the Crimean War as an event with major cultural, political, and military consequences. At this point, I admit that I feel like I'm starting to lose track of all those consequences, which I'd like to bear more closely in mind as I move on to the latest part of the 19th century. I'm hoping someone more knowledgeable might be willing to give me a list and summary of the major changes, so I can reference that going forward. Where relevant, I'd also appreciate it being pointed out to me where these changes were totally contingent, and where they dovetailed with broader already probable trends, just so I can keep the threads of causality straight. The Question: What were the major cultural, political, and military consequences of the Crimean War for Britain, and more specifically England, in the latter half of the 19th century? 

Being "developed" has nothing to do with how people dress (or don't). Indian society considered dress to be utalitarian rather than a means to hide the body because of some religious diktats. IMO that's highly developed, far more so than the primitive idea of letting your actions be decided by priests... Also, as a result they had no body taboos like are so common in primitive societies (and in modern societies, which in that regard are very primitive). 

And yes, you're quite right that a lot of countries had similar racial ideas to the Germans (Japan wasn't so much racist as placing no value on any human life, especially that of those who were shown to be inferior to them by being conquered in battle. What the Germans did to the peoples they persecuted was because of their race, what the Japanese did was far more casual. This is shown clearly at the very end, when the German government issued a decree that suicide missions were a disgrace and not to be pursued, were dishonorable, when the Japanese embraced them as a last ditch effort to save at least personal honour in the defeat of the Empire. 

QUESTION Are there examples of stone age cultures that had lived close to or had contact with iron age or medieval cultures, but did not adapt to metal technology? EDIT: The current answer by LangLangC is excellent, but I'd like to gather a few more examples, so I'm offering this bounty to whoever can provide the most new ones. Thanks! 

Background: During the 19th century the great powers of Europe colonized, and informally dominated, large portions areas of Asia, Africa, and (to a lesser extent) Central and South America. Often, as expressed in phrases like "The Scramble for Africa", colonization was a competitive process, with different nations pursuing their own interests in the same region of the world. During the 18th century and earlier, this competition sometimes involved war between European nations, both at home and abroad. But so far as I'm aware, this tendency to open warfare declined after the Napoleonic Wars, with the exception of the Crimean War, which I understand was caused in part by fears of Russian colonial expansion. Even then, the western European nations that were involved all fought on the same side. But the competition for the wealth of the third world must have continued, even if some, like Bismarck, thought that the expenses far outweighed the gains. The Question: During the 19th century, how did the European nations arbitrate the process of colonization among themselves? How did they censure nations that violated agreements, or skirted the line? What was their course of action if one colonial power pursued a course that threatened to destabilize a region? Or, as with the Belgian Congo, exact an unacceptable human toll? An Extra Note: I'm mostly interested in the core of Western Europe (France, Germany, Britain, the Dutch, etc.), but the question definitely isn't confined to that. Thanks for your time. 

To fill out JK's answer: the VOC directly controlled very little except the shipping routes to Amsterdam (and a few other Dutch ports, but the majority of goods arrived at Amsterdam). Indirectly, through deals and influence at the local courts of the rulers of the islands, they controlled far more. By supplying those rulers with weapons, advisors, European luxury goods, etc. etc. they effectively had exclusive trade agreements for most everything that left the islands for the outside world. This was of course later turned into direct control, with the local rulers becoming ever more figureheads for the Dutch governors and their governments, until eventually the Dutch East Indies became a full colony with a permanent Dutch controlled civil service. As the Dutch fleet in the area was also the most powerful in the area (more powerful than even the British for a long time, in fact during the early stages of WW2 the combined Dutch/British/American fleet in the area was under Dutch command because they had the largest contingent of ships and aircraft) their was little that competitors could do to break the VOC's trade monopoly (the Portuguese tried, and later succeeded by subterfuge as they smuggled nutmeg and other seeds out of the Dutch East Indies to their own colonies, causing in years following the prices of those commodities to crash in Europe as supply overwhelmed demand). 

In the early 20th century novel The Scarlet Pimpernel by Baroness Orczy, there are several references made to something called a water-party, with no elaboration other than that it's happening on a Wednesday and people are expected to bring presents. I was curious, so I googled the term several ways, and found nothing. What does a water-party mean in the context of Georgian England, or possibly in the context of the early twentieth century if it's an anachronism? Or is it just an odd way of saying a party on or near the water? 

I'm trying to get inside the heads of historical actors of the period. I'm sure the martial class was just as diverse as any social group, but give me the best summation that you can. I'll expand a little on the question below: What kind of education would a young knight have growing up in 12th/13th century England? Would it be purely martial? Would it, in some cases, include tactics or even abstract disciplines like history or theology? Would they have been acquainted with a literature or oral tradition, such as the courtly love poetry coming out of France, or local epics like Beowulf or The Battle of Maldon? Would they be taught a variety of practical skills, or would they basically just know how to mount a horse and point a lance? What kinds of cultural notions might they naturally imbibe, and would they have had any any universal formative experiences? That probably covers it. Thanks for your time. 

So in a way both are right. Taiwan was for a long time part of imperial China, but never was part of the PRC which was built on the ruins of what was left after WW2 and the Chinese civil war that followed it. And the old ROC claim to the mainland has validity based on the same history. 

These did not 'hold out', they were simply bypassed (with maybe some troops stationed in the vicinity to discourage attempts at breaking out and harassing the allied rear) as irrelevant towards the greater objectives of the campaign, Rome, the Ruhr, and Berlin. Once Germany surrendered formally, these garrisons laid down their weapons just as had garrisons of Dutch troops at Kornwerderzand in 1940, French troops stationed in places not yet attacked by the Germans ditto, etc. etc. If you want 'holdouts', look no further than the Polish partisans who kept up a campaign against the Germans from deep forests for a long time starting in 1939. 

Actually, the oldest national anthem in the world is the Dutch Wilhelmus, which dates back to the Dutch revolutionary war, being composed in 1574, with the text being even older, having been traced back to at the latest 1568. It was not designated as such however until 1932, but had been the de-facto national anthem since that time, including being used on official occasions like crowning of kings and queens. $URL$ has details.
