One possibility is that the other side is not sufficiently tightened. To me it looks like there is too much of the bolt showing on this side, which implies that it may not be able to be tightened completely on the other side. This may lead to slipping. The amount of protruding bolt on each side of the seat should be roughly the same. If you are uncertain take a picture of the other side as well. You may also want to check that the threads on the bolt are not damaged. If it was overtightened the threads may have been stripped, making it impossible to tighten. Otherwise, it could be wear to the clamp front surface as others have suggested. 

I have managed to convert the bottom bracket to work with three piece cranks on my early 1970s UO-8. It originally had cottered cranks. All I had to do was find a square taper bottom bracket spindle that had roughly the same spacing with regard to the bearings as the original. I reused the bottom bracket cups and used loose bearings. I had problems with unthreading on the driveside bottom bracket cup (it's not reverse threaded) so I used thread locker. It works okay. The quality of the only spindle I found at a reasonable price was not great, so it's not the smoothest (there may also be a slight mismatch in the bearing surfaces). Any of the more specific modern cranksets will probably require one of the more expensive bottom brackets with interchangable cups, such as the Phil Wood. However, if you're considering an outboard bottom bracket you will need to think about whether you need to face the bottom bracket shell. I am only familiar with using the Park Tool bottom bracket tapping and facing set for this purpose, which normally is used to face the bottom bracket shell after tapping. Looking at available tools, it should be possible to face the bottom bracket shell with a headtube facing tool if you find it necessary to do so. 

A quick Google search turned up some decent results that are presented below. Cycle-Routes: Seems to give a good overview of the routes that exist, but doesn't seem to give a point to point route. Could be good if you want the general overview of the area to plan your own route, but I usually look for a point to point route. $URL$ 

They aren't really interview caliber but I wear DZR GMT-8's to work everyday. They work nicely for a laid back business casual. DZR has 3 other models if the GMT-8's aren't your style. You could also try Chrome's Kurk-Pro, but those are even less office appropriate. I think the main reason that companies don't make them is that they don't see a big market. I hope this changes as more people decide to bike-commute to work. DZR GMT-8s: $URL$ Chrome Kursk-Pro: $URL$ Here is a picture of a custom job on some dress shoes: $URL$ 

The Park centering tool is just a symmetric piece of metal that fits into the truing stand. If you have a true wheel you can use that just as well. If you are concerned about the dish of the wheel, flip the wheel to make sure it doesn't matter which way you put it into the stand. The centering can be adjusted with the caliper arm lock nuts (according to Park this should only be done if you're moving by 3 mm or less). These are the silver colored nuts at the base of the caliper arm visible in your photo. To adjust them loosen one side and then tighten the opposing side by an equal amount. Do this in half or quarter turns. See the instructions at Park Tool's website for pictures and more information: $URL$ 

Even though it should not come out easily, occasionally the brake boss will work its way loose. Sometimes you can fix this problem by screwing the whole thing back into the frame and tightening it a bit. Then when you unscrew it again the brake bolt rather than the brake boss will come free. If that happens your problem is solved! Make sure that the brake boss is secure and doesn't have play. That would suggest some damage may have caused the loosening. 

Personally I use Google Maps with the bicycle directions option, but I am usually looking for commuting routes not exercise routes. 

I use many of the same techniques that @M.Werner recommends. Get a general fit and then tweak as needed. Generally I will take a guess at where things should be and then climb on. It is usually obvious when I'm way wrong. For a little fine tuning I will balance with a counter top or the like and then pedal backwards for a bit, obviously doesn't work with FG, hopping off and making tweaks. The final tweaks I make come from riding around noting changes to make and then when I take a break or am ready to turn around I make adjustments. I find I get a better idea for how well honed my setup is by actually riding than by measurements. 

An alternative to make the bike less glossy is to scuff the clearcoat a bit. It won't give it a nice matte look, but rather a "broken-in" well-used appearance. Use fine steel wool (0000) and rub the frame in circular motions. It's an inexpensive, simpler method for making your bike less shiny, but may not be the look you're going for. As long as you don't overdo it the damage to the clearcoat should be minimal. 

Tightening the two bolts on the back side of the stem should prevent it from turning freely. Make sure you align the stem and front wheel before tightening. The bolt on the top is for adjusting the headset. If the headset does not have problems, you should not need to adjust that bolt. 

As mentioned by others, barends are able to add additional positions. Some barends can be added to other barends, so there are plenty of options. Aerobars and dropbars are possibilities. 

Cycle Routes UK (different site similar name): Gives route information filtered by area, distance, path type, and difficulty. Again, it is not point to point, but if you are looking for good routes to exercise or time trial against it seems like a good source. You can even add routes that you know about that aren't in the system and help others. If you are looking for predefined and tested routes this would work nicely. $URL$ 

I use compression clothing because they are usually better at wicking away sweat and keeping me dry and cool (remember cotton kills). I also like that because they are tight fitting I don't have to worry about them getting caught in my bike, I have had shorts catch on different parts of my frame before. Another plus is that I think I look pretty good in compression clothing. Bike shorts with a bit of pad are awesome! But as far as fatigue I don't have any information. I think the prevailing theory is that compressed muscles will be less fatigued, but I have my doubts with that theory.
