The correct answer to this may vary based on country, as regulations differ. In the US it is common to see "homeopathic" applied very broadly to products that, yes, technically are not homeopathic. In my experience most contain at least one ingredient that is at homeopathic dilution, with other ingredients mixed in at non-homeopathic dilutions. HOWEVER... Regardless of the regulatory environment, the answer to your question as worded ("Can products labelled “homeopathic” actually contain active ingredients?") actually is YES. Homeopathic dilutions vary. Check the dilution chart at Wikipedia article on homeopathic dilutions It is only when you get to 26X (aka 13C) dilution, that you are guaranteed that there will be NO active ingredient left in the homeopathic product. Below that, there is still a tiny amount of active ingredient there. In my forays into pharmacies looking at what homeopathic stuff is being sold, I see quite a number of products that have 2X or 10X remedies in them. Science tells us those actually do have active ingredients in them. 

Back in the early days of the computer virus problem (the 1980s and 1990s), there was a certain plausibility to this question. Viruses began, in most cases, as mere forms of vandalism created by experimenters ("hackers") for their own amusement or bragging rights. Multiple anti-virus vendors emerged with solutions, and eventually they started advertising their products based on various parameters including the number of virus signatures included. As these things tend to do, this briefly escalated into a "signature war" where each vendor claimed to have more signatures than the others. Vendors jealously guarded their signatures so they would have an advantage over their competitors. It would have been easy during this era to imagine that there couldn't possibly be enough teenage hackers out there to create the thousands of viruses that the top vendors were claiming. In a search for other sources, one might assume that the anti-virus vendors themselves (who stand the most to gain) were creating the viruses. A number of developments around this time (the early 1990s) tend to provide alternate explanations for the virus boom. One was the emergence of virus creation kits such as the Virus Creation Laboratory, which allowed someone with a very low level of expertise to create new viruses at will. Another was the emergence of polymorphic code, a technique where viruses would alter their own code specifically to evade signature-based anti-virus software. Multiple polymorphic versions of the same virus would sometimes inflate signature counts. Because of the emergence of polymorphic code, many anti-virus vendors were forced to change their software (and their advertising messages) to get away from the idea of signature counts. Instead they used other heuristic ways to detect viruses. Frankly, trying to battle in the market over signature count is not a good long-term strategy anyway - your customers get tired of hearing the same message, it becomes costly to keep up your signature collection efforts, and so on. This led to anti-virus vendors beginning to cooperate with each other on signature collection. For a long time the Wildlist was a one way the vendors very quickly handed over new virus samples to each other, so all vendors would be able to respond to new threats in a timely manner. This continues to this day in sites such as Offensive Computing, where millions of samples of actual malware are available to logged-in users. The standards committees have even gotten involved, with the IEEE forming a malware working group to develop standards for rapid sharing of malware samples. Logic would tend to dictate: if the vendors are rapidly sharing samples, why create new ones themselves? And indeed, anti-virus vendors have always reacted negatively when others have publicly created malware for various purposes. Examples of such backlashes have included against a college class in 2003 and against Consumer Reports in 2006. As the tagging on this question would suggest, it is more correct now to refer not just to the virus problem, but the more general malware problem. This includes such concepts as the botnet, something we never saw in the early pre-internet virus era. And that change in definitions leads us to the biggest alternate explanation for the explosion of malicious code. As before, the explanation involves money. There are hundreds of ways to make money online, and many of them are well suited to abuse. This has resulted in the emergence of large numbers of cyber criminals who take advantage of these forms of abuse. These monetary incentives include: 

The lifespan, using this definition, can be affected by usage. Break this down by the reasons why the laptop ceases being used: 

What I've established with these references appears to support some similarity of the immediate effects. I don't want to draw conclusions which are not in the sources, and I'm not sure whether they are adequate to support the idea that the cumulative effect leads to addiction; perhaps we need more references to support that or perhaps an expert in addiction could confirm that this conclusion can be drawn. TL;DR There is scientific evidence of the effect on the brain and there are some similarities to cocaine use. 

'Cloud Seeding' Not Effective at Producing Rain as Once Thought, New Research Shows It's a hard problem to decide though - effectively "hypothetical meteorology" i.e. you must decide when, where and how much would it have rained anyway, had you not done anything. Other peer-reviewed studies have come to a different conclusion: 

$URL$ It appears over 90% of the list are suicides, natural causes such as heart attacks, plane crashes, road accidents and so on. I found some that look suspicious (Geert Tack,Benoit Philippens,Melissa Millan, Shawn Miller), but they're nothing to link them or support an overall claim of suspicious activity. Given that "bankers" is a group comprising many hundreds of thousands (maybe millions) of people it's a sad fact that some of those people will die unexpectedly in any given year. I don't think there's enough evidence to suggest a conspiracy or widespread foul play. 

Viruses, malware, etc. A laptop can only be practically attacked while turned on, so the chance of malware is drastically increased by usage. User initiated software problems i.e. the user deleted something vital or caused a performance problem by installing software. I would guess this is the more frequent cause of replacement of 3-5 year old laptops. 

There are plenty of online sources to confirm this list is accurate. I spot checked a few (Andrew Jarzyk, Li Junjie,Gabriel Magee, Ryan Henry Crane) and others have links to sources. As to whether this is unusual, suicidal bankers are not unusual:

Numbers of convicts compared to non-convicts According to one author around 50,000 convicts were transported to North America over a 58-year period before independence. In 1776 the US population was estimated at 2.5 million. Most of these were not convicts nor the offspring of convicts. So it is misleading to say that "convicts were sent to colonise [north America]" as most of the people that travelled from Europe to north America were not convicts sentenced to transportation. Europe Only Britain transported convicts to north America. So it is misleading to say that Europeans did so. You too are criminal offspring Almost all Europeans are descendents of Charlemagne and of almost everyone else alive 500 or more years ago. The reason is "if you go back 40 generations, you have over two trillion ancestors!". This also applies to other regions of the world. It is almost certain that every person on earth is a descendent of a criminal many generations ago. 

Judging from the number of web-sites that cover this topic, a large number of people have looked for this. None of them seem to have found anything commercially exploitable so far.

** EDITED to reflect edits to the question and discussion in comments. ** Everything in the article seems credible, and doesn't seem to contradict other sources. It does seem guilty of sensationalising the subject because there doesn't seem to be any unique link here - you can could equally draw similarities with love, food, sex, sports or many other things. Certainly we can say there are some similarities between facebook feedback and cocaine use which are backed up by scientific studies, such as this study published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience in which researchers used Functional MRI scans to establish that positive feedback on Facebook does stimulate the reward centre in the brain. 

I would say almost certainly not. I can't see any evidence the Japanese government has passed any law or made any promises to assume liability, and they are not liable under international law - the main law that governs this is the amended IAEA Vienna Convention which most but not all countries using nuclear power are signatories to. Certainly it would appear to be a pretty stupid move to assume responsibility here, and with no source for the claim it doesn't seem credible. 

Accidents. I'm making an assumption that a laptop in use is at higher risk of being dropped, liquid damage, etc. Fans, dust and other cooling problems: Increased use causes more dust be drawn into the system which causes heat related failures in many different componants. Fans also have a limited lifespan, affected by usage and further affected by heat. SSD lifespan is limited by write-cycles. Many modern SSDs will outlast their host computer, but none the less, the lifespan is affected by usage. 

In summary: No, a reliable technology does not exist. It's still unclear, despite several scientific studies, how effective the technology is. It might still useful, at least in some situations, but we can say for sure it's not yet "a reliable technology".
