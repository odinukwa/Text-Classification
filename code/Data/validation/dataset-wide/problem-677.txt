On a ride yesterday, I noticed a spot on my shorts where the fabric felt rough. After washing, the problem became much worse, and there are major areas of damage on both the front and back of the shorts. The following picture shows a close-up of a section of the shorts on the front near the chamois. If I look at the shorts closely, it almost seems like there are short little threads of elastic sticking out. 

In the end, each person must decide what they need and are willing to pay and whether a product provides benefits that they will appreciate. Don't jump to the assumption that other non-competitive riders are wasting their money on expensive crap, but also don't feel guilty if you don't notice or appreciate the difference in weight between two bikes. And if you end up doing longer or steeper rides, you can always change your mind later. 

Some anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that riding while listening to music using headphones is not safe: 

Although this is purely anecdotal, I know from my own experience mountain biking that most of my flats were from so-called "pinch flats" (where the tube is pierced by pinching or friction with the tire/rim rather than piercing by an external object). This was highly annoying. After having switched to tubeless some years ago, I've not yet had a single flat. And, obviously, without a tube to get pinched, there's no way to get a "pinch flat". 

I have a mountain bike with a 2003 Cannondale Lefty DLR Ti fork. As I've been riding the bike this season, I've noticed that the fork is behaving strangely. It doesn't seem to lockout fully and it is a lot "squishier" than it used to be. Also, when it decompresses after a hard compression, I notice a strange noise -- it's hard to describe but it sounds almost like gurgling fluid. I've already tried adding air to the fork using a shock pump (the pressure was very low) and that did make it a little less "squishy" but it's still not working like it used to. It seems to me that it's time to do some serious maintenance on the fork; possibly even a full rebuild. How complicated should I expect this repair to be? What specific skills and tools will I need? What is the procedure for doing a rebuild? I would like to evaluate the level of difficulty of this repair so that I can decide if it is something I'd be comfortable doing myself. 

Is my concern justified, or will a phone based GPS be accurate enough to give me a realistic speed indication? If my concerns are justified, can you recommend some ways to pair the wheel sensors with apps? What general features should I look for in a phone to bring out the best of it for use as a cycle computer / gps. 

I have concerns over the general accuracy of a GPS device to calculate speed. Mainly because I will be using the device in Eastern Europe, and not sure on the accuracy of the coverage. Because of this concern I was thinking of pairing an android based gps app to wireless sensors mounted on the wheel, much like you would do with a Garmin 800. 

Food and additional drinking material I intend to buy on route until I get out far into the country after about 50km's then I'll buy some stock for the road. What have I missed, and any additional tips for this ride are welcome. Last thing I would like to add, I've read on some sites that listening to music while cycling isn't advisable, what would you say? Should I take some form of self protection for the road? Mace or maybe a hunting knife - I mean you never know? Thanks guys - look forward to the responses. 

As JohnP mentioned, it sounds like your wheel may be rubbing against the brake. If you spin the wheel and look at the rim, do you notice one of the brakes getting closer and further from the rim as the wheel turns? If so, a few things to look at: 

Using the "approved" chain is probably better if all else is equal, and it may be worth a slightly increased cost for more peace of mind. If you already have the mountain-specific chain, there's no harm in trying it. And if the mountain-specific chain is far cheaper and you aren't picky about shifting performance, it will probably be adequate (but no guarantees). The "mountain bike specific construction" of the HG-X chains seems to be as follows (quotes from Performance Bike, High on Bikes, Amazon, and Competitive Cyclist): 

At least two reviews on Amazon for this particular pump report problems with the gauge, so I think you probably need to return it for replacement. Before you send it back, though, try DanielRHicks's suggestion to twist the gauge body. In a quick search, I wasn't able to find out whether this particular pump has an adjustable gauge, but it's worth a try. 

Is the v-brake a fairly recent improvement in rim brakes as recent as 2010? I know it is common for people to assume disk brakes are better. But I'm trying to bring down the price of my purchase, and do not intend to go cycling on rough mountain paths, or do too much wet/muddy condition cycling. Which is better in your opinion for my usage? 

I'm interested in purchasing a bike, however due to my location can't get into a bike shop, so will need to order it online. The 2009 GT 2.0 Transeo I am interested in does not explicitly say it has v-brakes. I know it is not the disk version though. The 2010 GT 2.0 Transeo mentions it has v-brakes. 

I have my eye on the Garmin 800. It looks fantastic, but alas I can't afford it right now. I would like a gps / cycle computer that would work well in Europe with maps. What are my options? I want something I can couple with wheel sensors for speed (better accuracy). Next month I intend to cycle through Czech Republic and Slovakia. Thanks in advance 

Familiarize yourself with bicycle laws where you live and ride. In the US many (most? all?) states require cyclists to adhere to the same set of rules that apply to motor vehicles when riding a bicycle on public roads. Some additional rights and responsibilities may also exist depending on where you live (for instance, where I live cyclists are allowed to pass on the right). Most importantly, once you know what the rules of the road are, follow them! The other day I was in the city and a woman on a bicycle passed me driving the wrong way on a one-way street. If you get into an accident doing something like that, most likely you will be liable! 

Bottom line is that when you ride a bicycle in traffic, you are already in a particularly vulnerable position and at high risk for sustaining serious injuries in a collision. It would seem wise to do everything possible to lower your risk of having an accident and I don't see how wearing headphones is consistent with lowering risk. Add to that the possibility that it very well may be illegal to listen to headphones while riding (as cyclists are bound to the same rules as motorists in many jurisdictions) and it seems like listening to music while riding is probably not a smart thing to do. Note that the above applies mostly to driving on public roads. When driving on trails, the laws in most places probably do not prohibit listening to headphones and the danger of a collision with another vehicle is obviously significantly reduced when you're not driving around speeding cars. 

This will be my first long distance cycle over 100km's / 62 miles. Last weekend I did a 60km / 37 mile cycle without too much difficulty, so I'm pretty sure I can get through at least day 1, day 2 will be a struggle but then again I have the whole day on Sunday and can move as slow as I want. This is the gear I am going with : Bike: Trek 7.2 FX (2011) (Stock standard, no mods) - recently serviced! Pants: decent mountain bike cycle pants with pads (not sure on the brand, but a good pair) Shirt: regular cotton t-shirt (nothing fancy) Jersey / Jacket : None Backpack : CamelBack HAWG 20 - holds 3l of liquid. Nav : Garmin Dakota 20 with heart monitor - and map planned - route broken down into 5 stages routing along cycle paths mainly, no major roads, except for the odd crossing here and there. Shoes: Beach style summer sandals with velcro straps - no socks! Contents of backpack:
