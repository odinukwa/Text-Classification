That said, in some fields references can be as simple as someone who casually knows you and your desires in life. For example, if you desire to work in the food/service industry, most staff is hired—or referred to positions—via word of mouth. So you could, theoretically, know someone who you play soccer with on weekends who could simply know someone who knows someone and even thought they have little professional connection, the natural “team” atmosphere of being on a soccer team would be understood as a positive for a back-of-house food prep gig. That last ultra casual example is hyper specific, but since your post is not clear on your career/job specifics I thought I would add that. 

You are not misinterpreting it but they are—most likely—not going engage in preventative efforts against you. That’s simply time & resource consuming. That said, clauses like this are basically “gotchas” in a contract designed to give the person creating the contract and advantage over you if/when the proverbial crap hits the fan. Meaning, let’s say someone on staff just doesn’t like you & can’t pin something on you (i.e.: They don’t like you and want you gone.) they’ll just dig up a clause like this—or others—and suddenly decide to use this against you. Then again, that is not something most sane & functional organizations engage in. It’s a waste of time & effort. The chances are slim. But clauses like this are put in place to make sure that in the oddball chance that they need you gone & have no other choice, they can hold this against you. From a corporate, bureaucratic & organizational standpoint contracts like this are drawn up to ensure the company is always in control of the situation and the signer is not on equal footing. If that makes you feel ill, don’t worry. Have you looked at your lease or rental agreement yet? Or any other casual contract you have. Heck, software usage agreements! Check them out! You might be shocked at how many of these “gotchas” exist in boilerplate language everywhere. 

What you are saying here is exactly what you should say. Stability. Job security. The ability to focus on the core of what I do instead of having to split time between the sundry issues that surround running a business. Be a part of a larger team with similar aspirations & goals. Tax benefits as well since being your own boss typically means losing a large chunk of your net income. Also place a time-frame on when you were an entrepreneur. If you did it for—let’s say—5 years, your answer to a prospective new employer can simply be, “I did my best for 5 years & am happy with what I achieved, but the stability of a standard 9-5 workplace is more appealing to me at this time.” There is no shame in saying any of that because the reality is most employers know all too well how much work running a business can entail outside of the core business functions. I assure you your desire for a more stable environment is not unique. So don’t think that looking for stability is a negative. 

Yes! Absolutely. There is nothing more a company wants than to hire a “white hat” hacker who actually understands the concepts of security, how to test for flaws & how to quantify flaws. You really have no idea how many parochial techs there are in the I.T. world who simply robotically follow a bullet list of items & don’t but really thought into what they are doing. Showing you are inquisitive, skilled & adaptive in the tech world will knock you to the top of any hiring list. 

Verbal agreements are not worth the paper they are written on. And—in an extreme case—they hurt you in the end because the company will ultimately have more resources at hand to perhaps legally challenge you in a confrontation about it than you have to counter such a claim. But you also say this: 

First, it sounds like one person is saying one thing about you & another is saying the opposite. So I would just take their opinion for what it is: Their opinion & not a reflection of who you are. That said, the best way I found to deal with interviewing issues like this is to simply go on as many interviews as possible. Might sound nuts, but here is the deal: While you might be waiting for the perfect position to come along, there are tons of positions out there that you can apply to & interview for. Just go ahead & apply for more than you are looking for, including positions you might refuse no matter what. The goal is to be in practice & get used to the basic rhythms of how these things go. Nothing more. Nothing less. Now I am not saying you should just carpet bomb your application all over the place. But find at least—let’s say—two other positions on top of something you want you can interview for. Anything to get you to be less “rusty” and more spry. And the net result of that is your tension & awkwardness should start to fade away or at least be controllable. Or you might find you were never tense or awkward but simply have a few colleagues who just might read you wrong. 

It’s absolutely not fair at all for you to ask for more fees because your client has learned from your work. Because when you code, unless it is compiled code that is perhaps encrypted, you cannot expect human curiosity to simply see what you did and learn from it. How exactly do you think any of us learn what we know? But that said, objectively look at what is happening: This is not a new problem, but a genuine new business opportunity if you play it right. So what you can do is make it very clear to your client that they learned something from your work. And then if they hit you up for work in the future, bill them more. But that is combative. Maybe you could do something more helpful that will get you paid: Offer your services to him strictly as a tutor. You do not code anything. But for a set fee, you teach him your skills. Should that fee be higher or lower than if you purely coded? Depends. But you should not close a door on an opportunity. This might seem like you are creating the competition but the reality is you are creating an ally and a client who will trust you for years moving forward. 

In general, email accounts at any company are not like a player’s number on a baseball team; it doesn’t get retired after you leave. Your email address at any company is not—and never—your email address ever for any reason. The company can do whatever they want with that email address and you have 100% no say in the matter. That said, you imply you still have access to that email account by stating this: 

Let’s face some facts: Few people want to work for free. We all work to make money; if they suddenly stopped paying you to do what you do would you still do it for them for free? Fairly confident that answer is no. And few people leave a company because they are happy with the company. By stating something like the above you clearly indicate you see more opportunities for “career growth.” Now what “career growth” means? Easy… That phrase combines growth potential in work/task opportunities as well as financial growth opportunities. By stating it that way you simply kill two birds with one stone. Also, if you do have to bring up finance as a part of a decision to move to a new company, don’t put the finance aspect on the new company; direct it to the old company. Say something like: 

Back Door Layoffs: This could be a back door layoff method. Meaning, while your company might not be able to formally lay off staff, they can create scenarios where people doing their jobs will simply “fail” and then be let go for failure to perform. Or force you to do work in an environment that drives you so nuts, you leave. Field-Testing New Policy: Yes, they had to engage in cost cutting before. But often a company sees cost cutting measures as a way to “field test” new “efficiencies” in their organization. Either consciously or not. So when the books are balanced again, higher ups meet, they see cost savings and then decide, “Let’s just make it policy!” 

So basically you took a job you don’t want at a commute you cannot tolerate simply for a perk that was hinted at but not promised? Look, I don’t know what your job entails—or what your company does—but I have worked for some clients who have attempted to “seduce” me into doing work for them by dangling “perks” like this in front of me. For the record I do work as a web developer and Linux systems administrator and these clients were fairly well entrenched in a culture where wining and dining and offering trips was a part of the culture. Guess what? I never went on any trips either. I too was a tad disappointed but at the same time I don’t think I would have enjoyed being flown on a moments notice from New York to Europe to then just sit in front of a computer and try to get work done on demand under a circumstance like that. In general, you should always look at anything being offered to you as a “perk” or “freebie” as something that benefits the company more than it will ever benefit you. Like in my case, all of these gigs lasted years but… They were gigs where I was paid but had utterly no benefits and not security or stability in my job. I mean yes, it sounds fun to tell friends over beers that you did X, Y and Z overseas. You sound like a jetset world traveller. But I assure you, unless the compensation or job experience is really amazing you will be flown to places you have never been to do miserable work while jet-lagged, never to enjoy the locales for fun and then fly back home to do more miserable work. If this is really a perk you want, make sure your next job includes something like this in writing… But like I said… Be careful what you wish for!
