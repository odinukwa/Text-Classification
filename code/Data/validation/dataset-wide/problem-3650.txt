UPDATE: Yes those exercises would work fine. The Y being a better choice than the I. Also just curious what is your goal and why are you trying to target the surpaspinatus? Ideally to get the most "bang for your buck" I'd use a more function pattern (consisting of a diagonal and rotational pattern) such as D2 Flexion. Some of the best shoulder injury prevention and rehabilitation programs consist of variations of these exercises. 

That's were the Prone Y's come in -- they will help accomplish this (strengthening while correcting dysfunctional firing patterns). 

What is great about this exercise - the shoulder flexion provides various degrees of muscle activation throughout the range of motion (ROM) also known as dynamic stability. 

You know that moment. You wake up a few days after a workout and think to yourself, "Ah, now I feel it." The technical term for this post-workout evidence of hard effort is delayed onset muscle soreness, or DOMS. 

The following hormones play a role in appetite regulation. These hormonal effects can be seen after acute exercise and are also associated with long-term appetite changes. 

Understand what the weight belt is doing and hopeful it makes more sense why it's so dangerous. The weight belt is used to compensate for a horizontally wrapping group of muscles collectively referred to as your innercore. 

It’s the runner’s biggest question and worst fear: how quickly can I get out of shape? After putting in hours of training and hundreds of miles, most athletes worry it will all go to waste if they stop. That’s only partially true. Unfortunately, plenty of hard-earned fitness can go away within two weeks. Most studies suggest that an athlete’s VO2 max, the maximum oxygen he or she can uptake and utilize, plunges in the first month of inactivity, according to Dr. Edward Coyle, the director of the Human Performance Lab at the University of Texas at Austin. VO2 max continues to decrease, albeit at a slower rate, for the first three months after ceasing activity. In highly-trained athletes, VO2 max decreases by 7 percent in the 12 to 21 days after stopping training and another 9 percent during days 21 to 84. In athletes who have trained for a few months, and increased their VO2 max with exercise, those changes are completely reversed with several months of not training. “It’s all about supply and demand. If you stop running, you take away the demand,” said Jason Karp, a coach and author of Running a Marathon for Dummies. All the biological systems that come into play when we run are closely connected, so while VO2 max might be one of the most noticeable and important changes, it’s not the only one. Blood volume also rapidly decreases, which affects oxygen uptake. Mitochondrial density, lactate threshold, and the ability to oxidize fat stores all decrease. Even the enzymes involved in metabolizing energy decline and become less active. “What really changes is the ability to consume and process oxygen,” said Karp. After endurance and cardiovascular abilities take a big hit initially, muscle mass and strength also begin to atrophy. In practice, runners often notice that while endurance capabilities go first, it can be possible to hang on to some speed for longer. Now, the good and bad news: all this depends on the individual. Ann Alyanak, who won the 2011 Columbus Marathon and was the 2002 Big Ten champion in the 10,000m, sees a wide variety of detraining effects with her athletes, particularly when she was coaching college. Some athletes would be fine after a week or two of not running and other athletes would lose fitness in that same time frame. How quickly that happens can also depend on where an athlete is at in training. “If you’re at peak fitness, then it goes really fast,” Alyanak said, often because you’re already tapering. “You’re holding onto it anyway, at the end of the rope.” And, if you’ve been training for a long time, then you can maintain some fitness longer. Long-term athletes are often in a better position than those who have been running or working out for a shorter period of time. That can be true even after months of inactivity. “If you’ve done it in the past, it’ll come back faster,” said Alyanak. Elite athletes or those who have trained consistently for upwards of 10 years may see more rapid decline initially than people who haven’t been exercising as long. The elite athletes simply have further to fall. But highly-trained athletes don’t decline to the same levels as less-trained individuals, even after three months of no activity — and, in most measures, they certainly don’t decline to the level of people who have never exercised. “Endurance athletes, however, do not regress to the levels displayed by individuals who have never trained,” wrote Coyle in a scholarly review of the topic. If getting back in shape after taking time off, whether for injury or a mental break, seems like it takes far longer than getting out of shape, that’s not just your perception. “It takes at least twice as long, if not longer, to gain fitness as to lose fitness,” said Karp. “It takes much, much longer to build a house than to knock it down.” Many of your systems have to be built back up from the cellular level, synthesizing protein and increasing the number of mitochondria. The half-line of decline in mitochondrial enzyme is 12 days, which means 12 days of detraining requires 36 days of re-training to return to the same levels, according to Coyle. Much, if not all, of the decline in fitness can be alleviated, though, through cross-training and through shorter intense efforts. If the intensity is kept up two or three times a week, then the overall training volume can decline without extreme decreases in fitness. When athletes taper before races this is exactly what they’re doing: maintaining fitness through short, hard efforts, but allowing their bodies to rest with less overall training volume. “You don’t need as much of a training load to maintain fitness,” said Karp. Losing fitness is not a reason, however, to not take a needed break — a fear Alyanak says pushes too many athletes not to rest. A yearly offseason is important for physical and mental health and can allow an athlete to come back stronger. Rest periods for injury or illness, particularly if they allow some cross-training, are far better than poor training and hurting yourself. “You’re not going to get out of shape in a few days,” Article from competitor.com 

I could not disagree more with those two statements and based on the high quality of some of your answers I'm surprised you'd write that. I'm posting this not to piss you off but hopefully show you a huge piece of the puzzle you're at least somewhat not fully grasping... 

Hips When it comes to hip positioning, it's better to be too high than too low. Too high simply indicates over-activation of the muscles that resist extension forces. In reality, this places you into a more difficult push-up position, not an easier one. It may not be an ideal position, but at least it's not dangerous. In contrast, low or sagging hips (the most common problem) indicates lack of innervation to the right musculature, placing greater strain on the spine. This precipitates a lazy push-up position with an overly shortened range of motion that's very easy to cheat through, allowing people to crank out dozens of ugly reps. So if in doubt, keeps the hips higher. 

According to The Institute for Sports Medicine Children rarely get tennis elbow. It is most common in adults, but can affect adolescents as well. 

It's not that simple. You first need to figure out what the exact issue(s) are and what tests will rule in / rule out the possible contributing factors. For example -- Without knowing these answers, you can end up treating a neuromuscular issue (such as incorrect muscle firing patterns) presenting as Lower Back Pain (LBP) by stretching your hamstrings. 

As you replenish your muscle-building and energy supplies by resting and eating effectively - you assure that you have all the necessary resources necessary to build muscle. In other words: 

This the same as above but without the cushion or pillow to raise it up – you are doing it right onto the chair seat. tip: to make it harder hold, a small weight in your hands in front of you , start with 1-3kg. 

There's actually a showing the process of joint cavitation -- what it looks like when a synovial joint is "cracking". Real-Time Visualization of Joint Cavitation 

1.) Place your hand on the opposite elbow as show below and the elbow and gently pull it across your body until you feel a stretch. 

A more technical answer - the greater the degree of flexion, the more your Rectus Femoris (which crosses your hip and knee joint) limits your range of motion (ROM). 

The Truth People tend to go overboard with the POWER of vitamins. You're likely getting what you need from food already, but taking a multi-vitamin won't hurt. Fat Soluble Vitamins A, D, E, K are stored in the liver and the only vitamins you can "overdose" in a healthy adult this is faily rare. Why? They can build up in your system as they don't dissolve in water. Again if you're healthy and aren't taking 1/2 a bottle of multi-vitamins daily this is something you really don't need to think too much about. Water Soluble Vitamins B and C are filtered by the renal system (your kidneys). Misconceptions Mega Does of Vitamin C (or any other water soluble) will cure your cold. The majority of research shows it does nothing. The placebo effect is a powerful thing. Special Populations One big exception is B-12 for vegan or vegetarians patients. Found in meat, dairy and soy it's recommended to take a B-12 supplement. Why? Your stomach produces a protein called gastric intrinsic factor (GIF). GIF is required by the small intestine to absorb B12. Without this your body cannot create red blood cells. 

Reverse Lunges make the most sense in your case (add a unilateral dumbbell carry if you’re able to maintain your balance). 

That not only means fewer resources that are available for building muscle, but because your recovery is also compromised. 

Not trying to start WWIII (and I think this is literally the first time I've disagreed with DarkHippo) stay calm. Everyone seems to freak out when they're questioned. JohnP was on the right track with his first comment. 

Updated : $URL$ Bret gets it. LOL Regarding the small sample size. You do realize how common studies of less than 20 people are? Large RTC studies are obvious the best but unless big pharma's backing you it's tough to find the funding. Just saw this part "Even if you do completely unloaded bicep curls you will still stimulate red muscle fibers."

It makes no sense to me why the rep range for “hypertrophy” and body builders is according to NSCA and many other sources is 3 sets and 10-12 reps. At the most basic level cross bridges formation determines strength, hypertrophy (muscle size), cross-sectional area and force are all and direct related. So in theory current training recommendations for strength such as 5 x 5's would lead to a greater increase in both size and hypertrophy. Assuming all major factors to be equal (diet, rest, volume load etc.) How does that recommendation make sense? What am I missing? (Related research is always a huge plus) – thanks! 

Failure to stabilize the spine isn't ONLY due to weakness. Altered neuromuscular firing patterns produce the same result. If you're more powerful global muscles are firing before your deep stabilizers this results in large force being applied to an unstablized spinal column. This is why the trA is so important. It is activated first before movement in any direction. Unlike your quadratus lumborum which is only active during sagittal plane movements. Directly from a Systematic Review: When rehabilitating a patient with low back dysfunction, low-load isometric motor control exercises for the TA and multifidi should be emphasized. The drawing-in maneuver should be performed with each exercise to elicit TA and multifidi contraction without activating global muscles. Rehabilitation of the local muscles with specific motor control exercises is necessary to enhance stability while protecting the spine from excessive loads during the rehabilitation program. 

Honestly whatever's comfortable. Wrist Flexion / Extension is essential a pure sagittal plane movement. Try a straight or ez-curl bar, use whatever feels best -- risk of injury is low as this is a distal joint (so it's a much more isolated movement). Other Exercise Options: Use a variety of exercises to help to maximize the strength and contours of your hand, wrist, and forearm. This increase in the overall strength of your upper extremities will also help to improve your hand and wrist dexterity, which in turn can improve competitive performance in athletics, gaming, and even in day-to-day tasks. Seated Wrist Hammer Curls In a seated position with your back straight, place your forearm on your thighs with your thumbs pointed upward. Use a 5-, 10-, or 20lb weight in a hammer position and lift it back and forth slowly for 3 sets of 20 repetitions. This will develop your brachioradialis muscle, which inserts at the distal aspect of the forearm at the wrist. Greater hypertrophy of this muscle will give more definition and balance of the forearm. Seated Reverse Wrist Curls This is to develop your extensor muscles and is also done in a seated position with your forearms on your thigh, palms facing downward, with the wrist three to four inches away from the knees. Grasp the weight and extend the wrist fully. Do this for 3 sets of 20 and be sure to not lift the elbows from the thighs when extending the wrists. Keep the palms down.
