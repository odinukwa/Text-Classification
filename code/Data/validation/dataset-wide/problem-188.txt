We start by pointing NASA's Deep Space Network at the appropriate point in our solar system. We move them if necessary. I don't know how long this will take. Now we can measure any gravitational-signal responses send back by the aliens. Then we come to the harder part. Generating the signal. So, gravity produces gravitational waves, as we have recently proved using two interacting black holes. Now I'm not going to suggest we create two black holes in our solar system (disclaimer: OK, I was going to suggest that we did that using our wormhole-generating technology until I read the question saying that we need to stick with current tech levels). However, those black holes were far away which is why they needed to be big to detect them. Can we get a similar effect by using smaller objects nearby? I have no idea, but since I haven't been paid yet as the lead scientist on this project, I'm going to say "Yes, with absolute certainty"! We make two Space JCBs. They are load-carrying spaceships. Then we fill up their load bins with heavy things (rocks, or lead, or uranium, or asteroids, or whatever is most fun). Now, the fun part. We send these Space JCBs to the point where we detected our aliens, and get them to play Space Chicken. We get these Space JCBs to fly towards each other, leaving only the tiniest of margins where they don't crash into each other. Their masses interacting will produce a gravitational wave, which since it's so close (or possibly inside) the alien spaceships, should be Super Easy to Detectâ„¢. However, for all these aliens know, that was just an asteroid crashing into another one, or however they explain common things occurring on the Light Side. So let's do it again. And again. And again. And again. But let's set up a specific pattern: a coding, if you will. Let's do one pass. Then wait. Then two passes. Then wait. Then three, and wait. Five, wait. Eight, wait. Thirteen, wait. Twenty-one, wait. I think you know what's next. That's right, back to one. This Fibonacci sequence was getting too long, so we'll stick to repeating this sequence up to twenty-one passes. Let's do this for an unreasonably long amount of time, or until the aliens notice, and our detector picks up some sort of coded activity in the wait periods - my hope is that our alien friends will start to pre-empt our numbers by filling in the wait periods, showing us that they are receiving our signals, understanding the sequence, and able to communicate back at us. ? Profit. 

Local features Mountains Apart from the global circulation of the atmosphere, there is lot of local features, that can create deserts, for example. In my opinion, one should roughly imagine where the clouds are coming from and where do they go. Clouds appear above oceans, the warmer the region, the more clouds appear. Then, they follow the prevailing direction of winds. (See the discussion above.) If there are high mountains between, there will be a lot of precipitation on the side from where the clouds go, and dry region, possibly desert, after that. Continents The water slowly rains away above the land. Hundreds or thousands of kilometers in the middle of large continent, there will be a dry region with big temperature differences between summer and winter. (Or even within one day for slowly rotating planets.) This might go to extremes for large continents. 

Well the way that we know about dark matter is by the gravitational effects it has. This is then a place to start generating our communication system. We are using our current levels of technology. OK, great. We can currently send things into space. We can also currently detect local levels of gravitation - . Taking these two facts, and using some our own dontaskium (similar to alien's handwavium but light instead of dark) to generate the appropriate governmental and public support and funding for our venture, we do this: 

Let's speed up this process The receiver should probably be used to guide the creation of the transmitter. You have a tri-state here, so I'm going to suggest: Forget about money for now. That will come later. Instead, get to poring through your research books to find the approach that works. Don't even bother reading papers. Go to a list of physics articles, and devise a scheme to map time-of-day to paper. If this isn't "normal" physics, then you should instead make an exhaustive list of the ways you are thinking of making the transmitter. We are going to use the time of data transmission as a hack to get more information, along with the bit value itself. It sounds like you are going to be able to have very high temporal precision with your data-sending, so let's give ourselves a 1-minute window. Now you have a mapping from time to "ways-to-proceed-to-make-the-transmitter". Your future-self already knows how to make the transmitter, and will have the mapping saved from his past (your present), so all you need is something to monitor the receiver and note the exact time (to the minute, or whatever temporal precision is appropriate) that the device receives the data transmission. Look this up in your map, think about it for a while, have the "Eureka" moment, then go off and build a transmitter (and another receiver). Now you can go to the casino. (Don't forget some day down to line to send a transmission back to the past to allow this all to happen!) But what if the specific breakthrough needed to make the transmitter has not yet been invented, by you or another? Well then we need to refine our process. We can send a 0 or a 1. Let's make the plan: Send a 0 if the breakthrough is from the map you created. Otherwise, send a 1 if the breakthrough is in a publication (book, article, news story, whatever) from that day - i.e., if you receive a 1, it's time to go to every physics journal, every news outlet, every book publishers, and find what was published today. Then again, have a think for a while, have your "Eureka" moment, build a transmitter (and another receiver), now go to the casino and make money. You can, of course, speed up the process by adding more receivers - adding one more receiver increases the number of items you can map to each minute from 1 to 4 (binary). Having three receivers, your map increases to 16, four receivers gives 32 items, etc. Depending on how many items you have to sift through and how fine-grained you need your guidance to be (and how patient you are), you can spend the money accordingly. 

Although my answer is surely opinion-based, I think the answer is: probably never. The reason is, that if you would like to compare human and animal genetic code to a computer code, it would look like 0 % of logic and structure and hundreds of millions years of debugging. This is how evolution works: random mutations are created and if they are useful, they spread. Computer programming can also by done this way with use of genetic algorithms. The results are often effective, but completely incomprehensible to humans. Already today, we can insert almost any DNA we wish into a cell. One could write DNA as a long series of letters and we would be able to synthesize it. The problem is not in the technology, but that we do not know what it will do. Since it is so hard to understand the DNA code, fine changes will probably always require extensive amount of research and experiments. The code is just too messy to change it so simply. If all animals are "very poorly written", we might ask how close are we to writing animals from scratch. It also seems very, very problematic. Unlike life, our software is very hierarchic. Higher level of programming relies on precise translation into assembler-like processor instructions, which rely on processors performing very precisely many simple tasks. Even processor is basically a simple part - transistor - copied many many times into very precise structure. Each level works perfectly and can be completely separated from the next. This allows us to understand it and write software efficiently. Basic units of life - proteins, are much more messy. They do not by any way work so cleanly as transistors and one probably needs much more trials and errors to persuade the whole machinery of proteins to work as intended, cooperating with other proteins. My estimate is that we could still need hundreds of years to find a way around it. 

NO What is the appeal of your MMORPG - do you know this or can you find out e.g. do XY testing on popularity of limiting this behaviour? Are people drawn to the realism, and does this include the capacity for cruelty and genuine response? If so, then from the business perspective you can't do this: granting AIs human rights makes such behaviour illegal, which your MMORPG can't support. You also can't remove the behaviour, as people will not want to play. The question comes down to a matter of public perspective: "consciousness" is not as hardly delineated as we like to believe - but we do like to believe it is. If you release public statements saying that you understand people's concerns, but that these NPCs are art not people: much like a painting or statue that may inspire high emotion in people, they are designed as conduits for our own internal feelings, but not actually alive. More philosophical thoughts on "human rights" in virtual contexts (you can use this in your press release if you want) - humans are not simply a sentient mind, they are a physical body whose form, abilities and weaknesses shapes our physical minds in every single thing we do. We cannot simply be copied, backed up, reverted to a previous version, have memories deleted, etc - our physical form is integral to making our personalities, desires, phobias, mind-states, rationalities and irrationalities what they are. Being "human" is not only self-awareness (or the appearance there-of) - it is the unique interaction between our bodies and brain and the environment and evolutionary history that has lead us to our survival. Virtual minds, sentient or otherwise, could be simulated to have these feelings - but in the same way that I cannot eat the picture of food on my PC screen (still lamenting this after 20 years of internet), simulation is an inherently different process than "human experience". Note that I am not saying better, worse or other value judgements - just different, and that "human rights" are not applicable. 

Alternative viewpoint: Maybe we shouldn't assert that behavior of aliens is in all situations so different from ours. Aliens, if they are evolved creatures like us, probably evolved their psychology to best serve evolution strategy they need. We can notice that dogs, for example, behave not so differently from us. Probably because they are pack animals, same as we are. Cats on the other hand, are solitary predators, and they may be quite inscrutable - their evolutionary strategy is different than ours. There is interesting (although very speculative) hypothesis how our psychology and morality is shaped by our evolutionary origins. It is called Moral Foundations Theory (more here and here). It assumes that morality of almost any society of humans contains elements of five pillars, which have quite clear evolutionary origin: 

Plot twist: the star system IS the intelligent civilization. The starship captain finally made it! After years of training, her first FTL flight had been a success. The approach was perfect, landing textbook and her disembarkment catchphrase worthy of Neil Armstrong himself. The last thing to do was to use the hydraulic ram to ensure the Comms Pole / Earth Flag wouldn't get dislodged after they left. She primed the Pole into the guide tube, powered on the ram and flicked the switch- Kranthos-5, youngest of the planet people jolted as a sudden itch broke out on its surface. Young and rash at 200 million years old, Kranthos volcanoed out a jet of lava to remove the offending sensation. "Strange, it didn't feel like an asteroid." ... Differences in scale make communication difficult. When was the last time you had a meaningful conversation with a cold virus? Edit: Oh you changed the scope of the question while I was writing this :( 

There is very detailed discussion about this issue in the field of Astrobiology. There is many constrains for "reasonable" life. I will try to go through most of them in short points. Let me use following approximate definition of life in my answer: 

With these assumptions, we can calculate how does the portal behave now. If previously, we calculated the difference in potential $\Delta \Phi = g h$, now this difference is reduced by the potential gain inside the portal equal to $a_g L$. So we have $$ \Delta \Phi=gh - a_g L\;. $$ With this assumption, now have to update the formula for $m_f$ to $$ m_f=\frac{2d(gh-a_g L)}{G}\;, $$ which leads to $$ a_g=\frac{2d(gh-a_g L)}{G} \cdot \frac{G}{r_g^2}\;. $$ By solving these two equations, we obtain the final formulas $$ \begin{align} a_g &= \frac{2 d g h}{2 d L+r_g^2}\;,\\ m_f &= \frac{2 d g h r_g^2}{2 d G L+G r_g^2}\;. \end{align} $$ As we can see, with large inner length $L$, the forces near the portals can be made arbitrarily small. It is still true that if you are going from the lower portal mouth to the higher one, you are going "uphill" and you must exert work. How does it look inside the portal? Interestingly, there would be no walls. The space wraps into itself, so it looks like if you are standing between four mirrors: all around, there are images of yourself and of other things inside the portal, just they are not images, but they are really there. You could see your own back. Conservation of Momentum The solution above conserves the energy properly. However, the energy is not the only thing that should be conserved. There is also momentum. With momentum, I do not have any nice idea how to put it into equations. But similarly to the previous case, I guess there would be forces acting on any entering object that change its momentum as it is passing through the portal. The forces would act both on the passing object and on the portal gates. If it is easier to rotate the portal gate so that the object would not change its direction of motion (yes, it could be easy - the portal gates could have negligible inertial mass), they would rotate to a proper position. If they are somehow fixed, the passing object would get strong kick from the portal and its momentum would be transferred to the portal gates. This would definitely not be pleasant experience if you are entering quickly - probably like hitting a concrete wall. Note I do not know if this is the solution you wanted, but it seems quite self-consistent to me. I definitely do not guarantee that it is consistent with the general relativity - it is probably not. (On one side because the portal gates are curvature o space and require extreme exotic mass, which brings additional effects. On the other side because the proposed model is not the only one - I know at least about one more consistent possibility, that is probably the case for wormholes. If you want to go this deep, you should be asking about wormholes, not portals. 

What about putting an edge and a hilt on one of these babies: Folding bike locks are designed to not break, so you are looking at something less flimsy than hollow telescoping swords. You could put in stoppers at each of the joints (I don't know what they're called, the ones where it locks into places and you push a button to release it) to lock each section at 180Â°. If this was well-oiled, a quick flick would fold each section out until it locked, leaving you with a nice sword that isn't hollow - the weak points are the joints/stoppers, so over-engineering them would be a good plan. Edit: forgot to say: Yes it's going to be at an angle. Yes you have to deal with it. If your segments are thin, it shouldn't be too big a deal.
