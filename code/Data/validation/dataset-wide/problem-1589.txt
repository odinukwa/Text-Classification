These three assertions are only supportable by extreme cherry picking of the literature, and ignore all contradictory evidence, and ought to have rung alarm bells from anybody that has taken the time to look into the arguments on both sides of the "debate". 

In other words, it was a contributing factor, but it would be an exaggeration to claim it was the cause. This is also bourne out by a quote from another author: 

While TheBlackCat's answer (+1) is fully sufficient, this letter that appeared in Nature describes the authors experiments which show that (in Boston) if you set up the experiment very carefully, you can show that the Coriolis force reliably dictates the direction in which water drains from a basin specifically designed to negate other influences (see also southern hemisphere replication in this Nature letter). However, the rotation was only counterclockwise if you let the water settle for 24 hours and only started 12-15 minutes after opening the drain. The interesting fact is that the letter concludes: 

There are references to other studies at the SkS article mentioned above (especially the advanced version). The problem is that you can always cherry pick studies to support a point of view, but the best course of action depends on taking a broader view of the scientific literature, and consider what is likely to happen in the real-world biosphere (i.e. you need to consider the local limiting factors around the world on a family-by-family basis). The IPCC WG2 report is probably a good place to start. I'm much more familiar with WG1 issues, rather than WG2, but this article suggests that the IPCC do not agree with Dr Idso. I should however point out that Dr Idso is presenting this work at a conference for climate skeptics only, funded by the Heartland Institute (a political lobbying organisation). It isn't the sort of place he is likely to get a serious scientific peer review of his work that will point out the errors.

The first thing to point out is that "no statistically significant warming" does not mean that there has been no warming, essentially it just means that there hasn't been enough warming to rule out the possibility that there has been no warming. If that sounds counter-intuitive, it is because it is, but that is the way frequentist statistical hypothesis testing works. The way frequentist hypothesis tests work is broadly as follows: Say you have a hypothesis (H1) that you wish to support using a set of observations (X). Next you define a "null hypothesis" that is basically what you need to show to be false in order for your H1 to be true. For example, if you hypothesise that there has been some warming, then the obvious choice for H0 is that there has been no warming at all, i.e. the rate of warming is zero. You then calculate the p-value, which is the probability of observing a trend at least as large as that observed IF H0 is true. If the p-value is sufficiently small, say p < 0.05, this is taken as sufficient evidence that H0 is false so we say that "we reject the null hypothesis" or equivalently "the rate of warming is statistically significant" and otherwise "we fail to reject the null hypothesis" or "the rate of warming is not statistically significant". Now the first point to notice here is that H0 should be the hypothesis you are arguing against. So for mainstream science, which suggests there will be warming due to the greenhouse effect, the natural H0 is that there is no warming. The "Skeptics" on the other hand hypothesise there is no warming, yet they are using that as their null hypothesis as well. This is a grave statistical error as it means that hypothesis testing no longer functions as a sanity check, as the skeptics are assuming that they are right and requiring evidence to prove them wrong. Mainstream science on the other hand are assuming that they are wrong (H0 is true) and asking if the observations refute H0 (implying, but not proving that H1 is true). Now for the second point. If the trend is not statistically significant, there are at least two reasons: Firstly H0 actually is true, and secondly H0 is false, but there is insufficient data to demonstrate that it is wrong. Consider flipping a two-headed coin four times. The traditional test for the bias of a coin will fail to reject the null hypothesis as even getting four flips in a row will happen by chance with a fair coin more that 5% of the time. This is because the power of the test (the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually false) is not very high. This is the case for the "not statistically significant" observed trend we have now, given the expected size of the anthropogenic trend and the noise in the data (weather), the power of the test is so low that it is not at all surprising that the result is not statistically significant. Easterling and Wehner have demonstrated that the climate will occasionally show decadal (or more) periods with little or no trend, and that this is also found in model simulations. To add to this, the hypothesis test assumes that you are looking at an n-year period chosen at random. If you cherry pick the start and end dates, the power is even lower, unless you compensate for the implicit multiple hypothesis testing. The quote from the Independent does not show that it is a "data error" A new study has found that global temperatures have not flat-lined over the past 15 years, as weather station records have been suggesting, but have in fact continued to rise as fast as previous decades, during which we have seen an unprecedented acceleration in global warming. Saying that temperatures have not "flat-lined" is not incompatible with the rate of warming not being statistically significant, because the latter just means we cannot rule out the possibility that the underlying rate of warming is zero. The problem is that most journalists, and an even larger proportion of climate skeptic bloggers don't really understand hypothesis testing. Saying that the rate of warming is the same as that before is not incompatible with the rate of warming being not statistically significant either for much the same reason. The comment about acceleration needs a bit more evidence though. The pause in warming is interesting, it is well explained as a result of the effects of ENSO (see the paper by Foster and Rahmsdorf), and it is providing an interesting area for research in climate variability. This does not however mean that the underlying rate of warming has changed, or that carbon dioxide is not a greenhouse gas etc. So the two views are not actually contradictory. To give a direct answer to the question, whether the warming is significant or not depends on the dataset you look at, how you choose the period in question, your statistical assumptions (e.g. taking into account autocorrelation and multiple hypothesis testing due to choosing the period after looking at the data etc.). Even then, it doesn't necessarily mean much unless you also look at the statistical power of the test. 

As far as I know, nobody is claiming that ocean acidification will result in the pH going lower than 7, so this is at best a straw man. The IPCC project a reduction by 0.3 - 0.4 units by 2100 (e.g. AR4 WG1 report) (current pH is about 8.14). The pH does not need to fall as far as 7 for there to be substantial impacts (see the three sources given for details). I suspect this is just silly pedantry on the grounds that a pH greater than 7 is alkaline, so it is inaccurate to say that it isn't ocean acidification but ocean dealkalinisation. However this is bogus as pH is getting more acidic and less alkaline as the pH drops, so it is perfectly correct to say that the oceans are becoming more acidic, even if the pH remains higher than 8. It is a bit like defining "hot" as meaning above 0C and "cold" as below 0C and then complaining when someone describes a change from 2C to 1C as "becoming colder" and insisting on it being described as "becoming less warm". The glossary of the IPCC A4 report defines ocean acidification as "A decrease in the pH of seawater due to the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide", so they make it very clear that they mean only a decrease in pH. Scientific terminology varies from field to field, if you want to understand the science, you do need to understand the terminology used in that field and not to try to impose your own definitions on what they have said. Having now seen the video, my suspicion was entirely correct. The OED defines "acidification" as "The action or process of making something (more) acidic; conversion into an acid; addition of acid. Cf. acidify v.". The inclusion of "(more)" means that the scientists use of the term is completely in accordance with normal English usage. Senator Ericksen at about 1:03:15 makes a comment that suggests that he understands that "less alkaline" and "more acidic" means essentially the same thing. BTW, a pH of 8.2 is not "strongly alkaline" as Easterbrook states, that is just hyperbole. If seawater is "strongly alkaline", one wonders how he would describe drain cleaner! ;o) Having looked at the video again, excluding the pedantry issue, Easterbrook only makes one scientific argument, which happens to be incorrect (which makes it rather ironic he described it as Chemistry 101 ;o). He states "The effect of global warming is to make the oceans more alkaline, not more acidic, because warming drives CO2 out of the oceans". Now it is true that the solubility of CO2 in water decreases with increasing temperature, but that is only part of Henry's law the other part is that the solubility depends on the difference in partial pressure in the atmosphere and the concentration in the water (the constant of proportionality depends on temperature). So increasing temperatures will have the effect of reducing solubility, but the increasing partial pressure of CO2 will have the opposite effect, tending to increase solubility. Which effect is strongest? Well the fact that the oceans are acidifying (rather than becoming more alkaline as Easterbrook predicts) and that atmospheric CO2 levels are rising at only about half the rate of anthropogenic emissions is very strong evidence that the oceans are taking up large amounts of CO2. It is the interplay of these two factors that to a large extent explains why CO2 levels have been so stable for the last million years, the pre-industrial equilibrium is the point where these two influences balance. There is a good series of articles on Ocean Acidification at SkepticalScience.com, written by Doug Mackie that sets out the basics in some detail. 

As I understand it, Pangea apparently formed as a result of a mantle plume producing very high rates of production of ocean sea floor, which in turn pushed all of the continents together, until the plume subsided and divergent faults within Pangea pushed the continents apart again. There seem to be a fair few papers about this sort of thing, e.g. here and here, but the geology is well beyond me.
