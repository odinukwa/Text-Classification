I've never cared what domain the email address has when looking at the resume. If it is from a prestigious school, then they should have that affiliation already written on their resume. The email address itself isn't going to impress, I think. Same goes for the personalized domain. The exception here is if they bother to look at the site attached to the domain and it is impressive. Again, in this case, it can be listed elsewhere on the resume too, if it is impressive and the applicant has the primary role in the creation of said site. I personally see mobile email addresses / yahoo accounts / edu and gov accounts / personalized domains as the same, so I wouldn't spend too much time acquiring an email address that looks good, and just list the one that you could respond quickly with. With this said, meta data / signature should still be taken into consideration, and the non-domain part of the email address shouldn't be anything too embarrassing offensive. 

I'm still searching for some definitive law, but when in doubt, it's a contract, and you never should've signed such nonsense. (I've seen it too, and walked away ... I don't regret it :)). If you want to be on the safe side, quit now. 

Such groups often stuck together even after passing, because of this very reason: They can't meet the expectations people have if they are alone. 

Then my simple answer is "No". You want graduated software engineers (I think?), not people who could be like them in some years. And, the fact that they are applying in a field so different from what they learned, could mean: They were not hired anywhere in they're branche because they suck (even in their own field), and now their so desperate that they apply to all jobs with a nice salary. Not a good sign for the employer. That you suddenly have not just one, but multiple persons from Material Eng. is another possibly bad sign for this. I've seen this often enough in real life: Groups that did as much as possible together in university etc. (and only barely passed the other things), because 

There is only a need to put the school you graduated from and the date of graduation. GPA is optional, but the only relevant GPA is that at the time of graduation. I think that adding the other school and the GPA at that school would just be too much noise on the CV. The only exception perhaps being applying for a position at the first school. 

I'll answer the question as it is asked. When I need to ask for help, I will usually go where I think I can get the answer the quickest. For example, if I don't know anyone, I will address either the manager or the whole department (such as the project channel in the company's slack) that is in charge of what I need information on. If someone answers me, I will continue going to said person as they have a history of answering me. If later someone adds on supplemental information that helped, I may go to that person instead when I need detailed information, but will continue going to go to the fast person when the detailed person cannot answer in a timely manner. If I don't have a means of asking the whole department at once, then I will stick with asking the manager for who can help me, and allow them to assign someone for me. If the manager isn't available, and I can physically go over to the desks of the department, I will either ask the most available looking person (by themselves, doesn't look like they are in too deep concentration, isn't wearing headphones), or just state my question in the general vicinity and allow someone to volunteer themselves to answer the question. I personally don't have a preference of the gender of the developer so long as I can get what I need in a timely manner, with the least amount of effort in asking from my part. I do not see gender as a factor of developer's competence. When asking questions, for me, it is mostly about getting a meaningful answer in a timely manner. 

And keep in mind that (depending on the jurisdiction), even an actual offer doesn't mean the have to hire you. ... 

That's easy: a) Calculate how much was overpaid b) Be sure to have that money available to be able to pay it back quickly c) Contact you old employer, explain the situation and ask what to do. 

First, as the other answer said too, be "very" careful if this is allowed. Probably it isn't - if a client is so important that the companies existance depends it, it is a good hint that you're really being an employee, not a consultant. And other than fines, it might happen that the company must retrospectively pay taxes etc. for you without you getting back the same taxes (meaning, paid two times). This can hurt much more than the fine. Anyways, some stuff about taxes etc. (very rough estimation, and many small things not mentioned at all): Currently, you have 52000 per year on your payslip as "gross" (not really) salary, which makes about 3700 14 times. After insurance and Lst tax, this might be eg. 34000, ie. 2350 14 times (nice - there are more and more web developers getting maybe half of it). However, because many people are just not aware of it, this "gross" isn't really gross - the employer has additional costs which are hidden to you, namely your insurance again (about half, while you see just the other half), and some other taxes and fees. Including this, your gross salary is more like 68000. If you are self-employed, you've to care about this previously hidden part too. Since you want "significantly" more, how about 2700 instead of 2350 - this would be instead 81000 instead of 68000 gross-gross per year. Then ... while Lst and insurance calculation are not that different between self-employed and not, there is also the Umsatzsteuer, 20%. Makes 97000. Since this is yearly, the missing 13+14 month are already in there. Not in there are the missing 25 vacation days, and average 13 (?) sick days. Since without weekends, national holidays, etc., there are about 245 days per year, this 38 days are about 15% which you get not paid anymore as self-employer person. This added makes 112000. Some random small fees collectively considered with 6% (house number, may vary), 119000. (Already more than double, compared to your payslip gross value). To this, add tax consultant, legal expense insurance, costs for computer stuff (hardware, software, server rent, redundant backups, etc.etc.), and of course office space (including rent, cleaning, furniture, electrity, garbage fee, etc.etc. - all of this is also relevant for home office, just not directly on an separate invoice. Also multiply this part with ca. 1.1 because tax details). What you have now would be what you need/want per year - however, you're not earning money for 8 hours a day over the whole year. The last big point is, enough overhead on your hourly rate to live through times without work as well as non-billable work. 

You've already asked him to explain why he did it that way. He gave you an answer that isn't acceptable to you, so rephrase the question -- "Why is it a good practice to write this type of test in this situation?", Tell him that relying on past tests is not an acceptable answer, and you would like to hear his reasoning on the matter. It is likely that his judgment is there, but explaining things is troublesome and annoying, so he just cited a past item as an excuse. You just need to force those answers out of him. If his judgment is indeed not strong enough, forcing him to explain himself each time will help develop that judgment. Let him know that this is to help him move up in the company (as he has come to you for advice, and you said you would support his promotion). If he is serious in his desire for advancement, he will go along with you. If he does not take these questions seriously, then he may not be the best option for advancement. 

The exact wording etc. matters in determining if it is valid, but basically it's allowed (HGB ยง60). Unless something else is specifically stated in the contract, it ends immediately when you quit. If is is extended, there are some requirements, notably it's max for two years after quitting and your (former) employer has to pay you at least half of the (former) salary (HGB ยง74 and ยง74a). As for the other point... 

This sounds very much like you seek someone to blame for your disappointment for not being hired. This few sentences do not mean that this manager and every other company on the world are 100% liars. 

It really depends on the company culture. If it is an older/large company, there is a large chance that it may require suits for work, but newer smaller companies are starting to dress more casually, especially if it is a non-customer facing position. Have you not seen anyone from the company, or pictures of the work environment? Emulating that manner of dress would be acceptable. However, your best bet is to just ask your contact what the expectations are. If you can't get a good answer from your contact, then I would recommend wearing a suit on your first day, and figure out what to wear on your second day on from there. You'll leave a better image being overdressed than you would being underdressed. There are still many old-fashioned people who take this sort of thing seriously in Japan. 

Option 2: Don't get a headache about this and keep up the good work. Telling the client "you can trust me, you can trust me" like in some sect (just not that directly) has a high chance of backfiring if the client is suspicious right from the start. Another point: Why is it so important to make him believe the result will be satisfying before he/she can see the result? It shouldn't be. As soon as the product is done, if it is satisfying and not overpriced, the client has no reason anymore to believe you want to rip him off. And before that point ... you work, the client pays, and the client has at least enough trust to give the job to you. If there are problems about secret informations or anything like that, and the client hesitates to give it to you to do you work, just ask how you could do it without having it. If it's really necessary, either you get it or there won't be a finished product. The client will understand that (or give you an feasible alternative). 

It kinda depends on the scale of the company. 500k in sales at a huge company would be considerably less impressive than 200k in sales at a 3 person start up. There is also a difference in what is being sold. If it is a physical product, what is the profit margin? Is it something with little to no overhead? Honestly, if I saw numbers in a resume I wouldn't really think anything of it unless the numbers were considerably high -- in which case I would ask for clarification during the interview -- which will likely need to be done either way. I wouldn't put actual numbers in my resume for the reasons above. Without more context, they are meaningless. 

Don't say anything. Because, a) the raise is not a "thank you for all the hard work you'll be doing next year". You earned the raise already. And b) 

exactly. Until you know you have another job, continue everything of your previous one like before. Working, getting raises, etc.etc. And to start with, what will your boss think if you decline a raise? Whatever reason he/she guesses, it won't be positive. 

It sounds like you don't need her teaching you because the manual is good. If that is true, do you have any personal disadvantage because of her sleeping? No? Then let it be. You gain nothing except for potential problems, hostility etc. Let the manager do his own job (if she does this often, he will notice somewhere in the future).
