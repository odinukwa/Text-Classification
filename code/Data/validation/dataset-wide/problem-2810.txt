I am not familiar enough to know a passage in any utilitarian or consequentialist works on this point, but my suspicion is that the answer here would also be yes unless the thing to be maximized is "autonomy." If it is autonomy understood as pure expressions of freedom, then no such wrong is possible. But if it is suffering, then there's no reason to imagine that you are not committing a wrong against yourself when you act in such a way that increases your suffering. 

Information is not a term that appears often in philosophy. It would tend to only occur in some contemporary niches and has little if any historical provenance. Data emphasizes that something is just the raw given before it is processed in some way shape or form. Philosophers here are operating from the sense in which datum is the past perfect participle of the verb "to give." Data is thus normally contrasted with something like perception or possibly knowledge. There's no universal consensus on what data would be among philosophers. Instead, that is a point of contention with some dismissive that such a thing exists apart from perceptions and others asserting that it is what perception acts on. Mostly these debates are going to be in epistemology. At least for me, key thinkers I can think of who are in the debate about data are going to be Locke, Berekely, Hume, and Kant. There's probably a contemporary analytic literature on this problem as well. 

But before we assume that's what's happening there's two issues worth mentioning. First, many normal language expressions can be formalized in multiple ways, and it's not immediately clear that this is exactly the argument your friend means to offer. This ties into the second issue: the principle of charity, which at its simplest is the idea that one should take one's interlocutor's arguments and put them in the best possible light rather than the worst possible one. To give a better reconstruction: 

More generally, I'm not sure that this would qualify as "true but unjustified belief". First off, there does not seem to be anything true about it since the underlying claims and reasons would be false. Second, it would seem to just instead be a useful lie that gets people to behave but in itself has no truth. A second though that crosses my mind is that there's an odd intersection of terms here with "reformed epistmeology" and the idea of "warranted Christian belief" proferred by Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff. But that thesis is roughly opposite in arguing that some beliefs, including belief in God, are properly basic and not in need of external justification for their truth. Instead, these basic beliefs are necessary to make good sense of the universe. 

Then one could simply add that it is "of the proletariat" because that group is the majority (even if it is a democratically decided majority). n.b. I am not here trying to make the argument. Instead, I'm trying to point out that in informal contexts, whether something is fallacious is (almost always) arguable and hinges on (1) identifying the argument some intends to make and (2) hashing out whether what they did argue is flawed in some relevant way. At this point, whether that mistake is a named fallacy or not really loses all relevancy. This stands in stark contrast to formal fallacies in formal arguments (e.g., a proof in pure math) which are damning for the argument. 

Work of the Form: Cat is what enables you to unify the disparate phenomenon that you see under a single idea. 

In Meditation 1, Descartes talks about often being deceived -- especially by his senses. He then decides to embark on a quest to find certainty by abandoning everything uncertain and clinging to only what is certain. He flirts briefly with the idea that he's being manipulated but abandons it -- in part because if he accepts he cannot get off the ground at all. 

As far as empirical science is concerned, our actions are determined Moral responsibility requires our actions to be free 

The third feature highlights how analytic philosophy was, in part, a reaction to the philosophical style of the British Idealists who followed Hegel. But there's several different thinkers I can think of who have a positive relation with Hegel doing contemporary philosophy: 

We have adventitious, innate, and aggregated ideas. Adventitious ideas are only as great as their sources. Aggregated ideas are merely adventitious ideas that I collect from multiple sources. We have an idea of God as infinite perfect, etc. If this idea of God came to me from the outside, it must come from a source equally infinite (per 2-3 with the conjunction that the idea of God exceeds my capacities). Ergo, if it is adventitious, then there's a God If the idea is innate, then only God could implant such an idea. 

Kierkegaard addresses the idea of this type of disconcerting failure under the concept of vertigo through the pseudonymous works Concept of Anxiety by Vigilius Haufniensis and Philosophical Fragments by Johannes Climacus. In both cases, this disorientation is a sign of the dialectical problem of taking your bearings from an inadequate source -- a theme more completely considered by his pseudonym Sickness unto Death by Johannes Anti-Cliamcus. For Aristotle, lack of confidence is a type of vicious character. The Greeks unlike us though hubris or something near to it was a virtue of the magnanimous man alongside the right forms of hospitality and justice. For Sartre, this is being situated by another and should be overcome by one's own bold assertion. If you can give more contours to the emotion, then it would be easier to narrow which philosophers are meaningful to your issue. 

tl;dr - save one woman is guaranteed to save one life now (= actual). Saving data cubes is making a choice that might save many lives in the future (= potential). actual > potential. 

There's a lot going on in here that relates to the history of thought. We get our English word idea from the Greek word ἰδέα ( idea in their alphabet). But we often use it like "I have an idea". We assume ideas are things in our head. 

Confucians and Chinese philosophy more generally. The volume Confucian Ethics edited Kwong-loi Shun and David Wong contains several articles that spell out Confucian objections to rights talk. More broadly, rights talk is not a feature of any classical school of Chinese philosophy or thought. Plato. Rights are not a major feature in his account of the polis. 

Now on to the answer as to why at least one of these arguments must be invalid. First, we need a definition for reference: validity means that if the premises were to be true, then the conclusion must also be true. Second, I'm not quite sure what "pieces of reasoning" are. I'm going to assume that means arguments. Third, it is possible for contradictory conclusions to be reached by valid arguments. This is true because validity only looks at the logical relationship between the premises and conclusion. Thus, we could conceivably have two valid arguments with the conclusions Oswald shot Kennedy and Oswald did not shoot Kennedy. (Thus, the explanation you provide is wrong (or at least horribly unclear) -- because contradictory conclusions means nothing). What matters here is what happens when we apply the definition of validity to each argument in conjunction with the stipulation that the sets of premises for each are true. Let's say the shot argument is argument A. The did not shoot argument is argument B. We can construct the following argument: 

For the first category, famous citations and statistics help (I would suggest for instance Kant's views on animal suffering as a place to start). For the second category, you don't really need them. Depending on the scale of where you are trying to make these claims, this is not the most important thing to focus on. (If you are aiming for a journal, try to see if people in that journal generally concern themselves with (a) empirical surveys when they mention common views or (b) like famous figures or (c) gleefully say things like this without citing anyone). 

And that things when rendered under for the forms of sensibility (space and time) are sensibles for us. And then when subject to the apparatus of the understanding (which for him is 12 categories) become objects of our knowledge. In other words, Kant's claims about not being able to know things is an epistemic claim -- rather than a metaphysical one. In fact, it hinges on a metaphysics of understanding where such things do exist but are restricted from our knowledge precisely because the process of knowing makes them sensibles and then objects for us. I take it that Berkeley's idealism is suggesting more of an Occam's razor regarding the metaphysical existence of things like things-in-themselves, i.e., if we cannot encounter them in our world of ideas, then we should not speak as if they exist. 

P and not P by assumption -- we can start our proof with any contradiction, so we arbitrarily pick P and not P P by &E1 (we can always reduce a conjunction to one of its terms without changing the truth value since P & Q is true iff P is true and Q is true.) P v Z by vI2 (we can always introduce a disjunction when we have a true element because the truth value of P v Q is true is if either P or Q is true). ~P by &E1 (see 2) Z by DS 3,4 (given a disjunction, if we know one half is false, then the other half must be true for the whole to be true). 

Yes, there are such compendiums, but I would not recommend depending on most of them. One that was interesting and gets things roughly right is: Sophie's World. I hear good things about Copleston's History of Philosophy. But can things be reduced down to a great extent to a few simple syllogisms? Probably not. To illustrate the point, considering the following answers to the question: Who was Josef Stalin? 

There's a couple different things going on in your expanded question. Let's take it sentence by sentence. 

I think Kant sees it as consistent with treating people as ends, because murderers have committed the moral evil of wiping one of those ends from the earth. Moreover, it is that you must treat them as ends and not mere means. And capital punishment is not a means to a different end, but an embodiment of justice for Kant. Moreover, it's an implementation of the universalizability schema. i.e., the murderer wills that human life should be snuffed out. Ergo, his maxim is made universal for him. 

If you aren't allowed to just draw any conclusion from a contradiction, then you bracket this by assuming : ¬ ( S & I) as a subproof as step 3, drawing the contradiction (now 3-6), then proof by contradiction using the subproof to get S & I 

For Aristotle, every natural kind has an essence. In this respect, his view has some similarity to Plato's account of the Forms. The difference is where the essence/Form is. For Plato, the essence is in our souls / in the mind of God. For Aristotle, We intuit this essence when we look at the thing, and we learn the essence in this way. Aristotle uses the term "soul" to refer to the essences of living things. These essences have activity -- i.e. life. Thus, it is the nature of plants to require sustenance and grow and reproduce while they are alive. If you kill them, then what remains in Aristotle's view is not a plant. Animals join to this further abilities of sensation, motion, and to some extent cognition. It is their nature to do these things and thus part of their essence / soul. Thus, the quoted passage is stating that you cannot speak of the bodily parts of a living thing without simultaneously referring to its soul. Part of the reason is that the soul is what we intuit that makes the thing that kind of a thing. In other words, if I look at a dog's tongue, when I recognize it is a dog's tongue, I am referring not just to the arrangement of atoms that are the dog's tongue but also the fact that it is arranged, living, and functioning as dog's tongue. In Aristotle's vocabulary, it is actualized as a dog's tongue. The activity is that of soul as organizing matter dogwise and then as a feature of this toungewise. The thing acted upon is matter (or in Aristotle's vocabulary passive). Thus, he's saying it makes no sense to speak of the matter of an animal, plant, or human without simultaneously speaking of its soul. Part of the reason goes back to the first difference I highlighted between Plato and Aristotle. For Plato, when we look at things in the world and see them as things, we are looking at a bad shadow / imitation of the Form. For Aristotle, we are looking at matter and recognizing through our senses (through the creation of an image [lit. phantasm] and then the use of our mind an essence in the thing. Thus, we see something that is formed matter as we see the activity [soul] arranging the matter according to the kind.
