I am hoping to buy one of these in the next few weeks: Specialized Roubaix SL4 Expert Disc Di2 2014 Road Bike But I will be using it for commuting and need some luggage so I need to fit a pannier rack (I'm going to ignore all the shouts of horror about using this bike for commuting or putting a rack on it). Initially I thought that this was not possible and I was looking at getting a custom Titanium frame made with the same components. I have now found a couple of options though. There is the Tubus set of pannier racks. I have used a Tubus rack before on a bike with no eyelets and it seemed to work very well. If I use the Tubus Clamp Set For Seat Stay Mounting and the Tubus Adapter Set For QR-Axle Mounting I think that'll work won't it? I am unsure if the rack will clear the disc brakes though... There is also the Axiom set of racks as shown in the video. They specifically make a rack for road bikes with disc brakes which sounds very promising. I can't see how the rack will attach to the frame at the top with no eyelets and no caliper brakes. I could use the Tubus Clamp set though (which I have on my current bike) So, Will mounting this to my bike damage the carbon frame? Any recommendations about which rack / mounting system I should go for? Thanks 

(this isn't a discussion on the attractiveness of large cyclists and likelihood of sexual congress...) In my cycling career I have varied between 22 stone and 15 stone. At 6'2" the leanest I have ever been is still over 20% body fat. I am not sure I've ever bonked... My normal cycling day is an 18 mile ride into work before I have eaten or drunk anything. I have a yogurt granola thing for breakfast and salad for lunch. Some fig rolls mid afternoon then cycle 18 miles home. I have done 80 mile training rides and really not eaten anything much. I do sometimes feel tired and a bit weak but I thought that bonking was worse than that. I assume that as I carry quite large energy reserves around with me that I don't bonk. 

Scrolling down further under the "Description" section the following additional information is found: 

I'm interested in using BSA crank parts with a certain BB30 frame and I'm a little unclear about cable routing, I'm hoping somebody here can help clarify the confusion. I'm considering purchasing a Dengfu FM286: $URL$ The concern is that I'm going to use a BSA crank parts and they only have a BB30 frame available in my size (3 month wait for BSA version in the proper size). I'm under the impression that frames with internal cable routing can allow the cables to pass the BB area in one of two ways, either through the BB opening, or underneath on the bottom of the frame in tubes, is this correct? For the typical BB30 to BSA adapters, for example: $URL$ $URL$ I'm under the impression that these could be used on a frame where the cables route in tubes underneath the frame, but could not be used in a frame where cables route through the BB opening, correct? If so, here is the further confusion on my part. I emailed Dengfu pertaining to the frame linked above, and received this response: "I show you pictures of BSA adapter and BB30 frame bottom. You can install cables internally." Here are the pics they sent: 

My head is spinning with confusion on BB terminology, I'm hoping somebody can clarify things. I'm interested in building a road bike with the Dengfu FM098 frame and an Ultegra groupset that I would like to purchase from Chain Reaction Cycles. The frame is here: $URL$ And from Chain Reaction the Ultegra groupset can be purchased here with some options: $URL$ or here with pretty much every conceivable option: $URL$ So here is where the confusion begins. The Dengfu link above lists the FM098 Bottom Bracket as "BB: English BB/BB30", I'm under the impression that this means a choice of an "English BB" or a "BB30" bottom bracket, is this correct? Now considering the Chain Reaction Ultegra Groupset links, the one with fewer options does not list an option for BB, rather it states "Incl. Hollowtech II Bottom Bracket SM-BBR60 BSA". The Ultegra Groupset builder with the many options has 2 choices for BB after choosing the Shimano Ultegra 6800 Bottom Bracket option, "English 68mm" or "Italian 70mm" So I checked the Wikipedia page for BBs: $URL$ The table towards the bottom (see the column heading "Bottom Bracket Thread Name") seems to imply that ISO/English & BSC (British Standard Cycle) and BSA all effectively mean the same thing, and that the shell with for these is 68mm. At this point I'm under the impression that the Denfgu "BB: English BB/BB30" means a choice of an English Bottom Bracket or a BB30 Bottom Bracket. I'm also under the impression that the Chain Reaction Cycles Ultegra Groupset with "Incl. Hollowtech II Bottom Bracket SM-BBR60 BSA" would match the Dengfu frame with the English BB option, since BSA seems to mean the same thing as English, and English seems to be 68mm, is this correct? If not, would the Chain Reaction Ultegra Groupset Builder with the "English 68mm" option fit the Dengfu FM098 frame with the "English BB" option (supposing this is actually a separate option from the "BB30" on the Dengfu FM098)? Sorry if this is a beginner question but BB terminology can be quite confusing! 

Again, stop, make sure the other person isn't hurt and doesn't have any mechanical trouble that'll stop them from riding. If there is an injury or either party thinks it necessary, exchange contact info and/or wait for a responding officer. 

Recumbents are great for riding in flat areas, though not as good for hilly areas -- they're not quite as stable at low speeds since you can't as easily reposition your hips, and you can't stand up to torque when you run out of gears. 

Obviously even in a solo competition, one need not excel at all these to be a good cyclist, just be almost as good as the competition in each and excel in one. Cycling really is a team sport though, so a team can still function well if the strategic skills are distributed as long as each member can execute tactically. 

The recumbents that do really well on human powered vehicle speed tests tend to have smaller wheels so that they can get as low to the ground as possible and keep a small wind-profile. It's not because the wheel is smaller though. One thing to keep in mind is that smaller diameter wheels tend to be made wider so that you get a decent size contact patch to corner and brake. This may offset any aerodynamic gain. Aerodynamic gain comes from making the whole bike shorter (as in a recumbent). If you have to make the wheel thicker than the frame, then you're actually adding to the wind-profile. The main arguments for large wheels off the track are 

First, get yourself a decent torque wrench with allen head bits in all the sizes you use for bike parts. Second, print out a sheet of common torque values and keep it handy. There's one at the link above. You can destroy parts by over-tightening and you can build a bike that'll fall apart underneath you by under-tightening. Get yourself a maintenance manual. The web is a great resource, but professionally edited manuals organize information far better than any mailing list. If you can afford a used copy of Barnett's Manual, you should have them available. They're the best reference when trying to build out a bike. Some co-workers that I used to ride with and I pitched in for a set that we kept at the office and we'd come in on the weekend to work on bikes. "Zinn and the Art of {Road,Mountain} Bike Maintenance" are much shorter (and cheaper) alternatives and are fine if you're using fairly standard components. I know I just recommended paper manuals, but I found it helpful to download installation instructions for components and use my PDF viewer to zoom in on the diagrams. The printed ones are too small for my eyes to really see small details which might help you tell whether parts that come in pairs have any chirality to them. Finally, take your time. Don't plan to start building out your first bike 2 weeks before a tour. Start getting parts and working on it early and try to do anything that might require specialized tools or skills like reaming or press-fitting first. Some things like prepping a head tube will probably require a trip to your LBS. 

I'm under the impression that "O.L.D." = Over-Lock-nut Distance, i.e. the width of the axle between the threads, which should correspond to the distance between the inside of the drop-outs on the frame. I'm trying to figure out what the drop-down options mean and which is the correct choice in my case. Here's my best guess as to an expanded explanation of the options in the drop-down (also using the information from the description section): "QR / QR for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a traditional quick release (100 mm wide), rear axle is a traditional quick release (135 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "15mm / 135mm QR for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a thru-axle (15 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a traditional quick release (135 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "15mm / 142x12mm for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a thru-axle (15 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 142 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "12mm / 142x12mm for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 142 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "12mm / 135x12mm for Shimano/Sram 10,11s +$10" means: front axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 135 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes, at $10 additional cost Is my understanding correct? Returning to my specific situation, I'd like to stick with traditional quick-release skewers at both the front and rear, and I used an 11 speed Shimano Ultegra rear derailleur with the FM286 build. So, considering all of the above, I'm under the impression that the correct choice in my case would be the first axle option in the drop-down, "QR / QR for Shimano/Sram 10,11s", correct? Can anybody confirm my understanding of the above? If I'm incorrect in my interpretation anywhere, please clarify, thanks!
