I would like to instead develop a report that a technician could run to determine through stat regression when the log records would be out of bits. So I now need a select statement that would retrieve the LogRecordNumber for each interval of time where we have a log record. Getting the log number once a week would be appropriate and allow me to make a reasonable regression guess at when we will be out of bits. Again these data can be as far as a year back or as soon as a few months ago, so hard coding something like DATE(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) - X WEEKS is not possible. Is there any way to do what I'm suggesting with a query, or do I need to rethink this? If it matters, the database in question is DB2. 

Because the table name was fully qualified with "MYAPP" instead of supplying it later, they cannot simply copy the code that they already have within the same DB2 and just change the schema name. They would like entirely new DB2 subsystems to avoid this issue. Is there any way to avoid this? Are there any bind parameters or other strategies I could employ to have duplicate schema names running on the same DB2 subsystem? 

Is there a way to use named markers in DB2 for z/OS to indicate that the value will be the same so graphical tools only prompt for one input? On queries that have 20+ inputs, this can be time consuming. Is there a better way that I should be doing this? 

Hello everyone I have made a backup to my Oracle 11g dtabase with SID=ORCL using the command this my output after performing this command 

Can you try this , now your password column will be if you want try to do the same for the username . if that does not work please share more info about your table by executing the command in MySQL. 

Hello everyone I'm unable to connect to my Oracle Server remotely using SQL developer ....while I can connect from SQL developer when I'm in the server directly ....I get the following error when I try to test my TNS listener 

Hello everyone I have got a product stock table with a time-stamp column so the so any updated to that row will update the time stamp ,I'm happy with this setting but sometimes I want to update the row without updating the time stamp,so how to write mysql statement that update a specific column without updating the lastUpdate column ? this my statement: 

If it was me who doing the design what I will do is create a with name each nationality have ...and since the the user have multiple nationality ...in the table I will create two columns () for nationality and referencing the table . the above scenario in case for two nationality . for multiple nationality (unlimited) check the below scenario the scenario for this situation will be similar to Customer and orders (one-to-many) ...one customers have many orders ...you will need 3 tables in the table you will the following columns ,, ...the is column referencing the in the table and the is a referencing for the table . hope that will help . 

I believe it is possible to used named parameter markers in other RDBMSes to indicate that the value should only be given once. Example: 

We have several application teams that are looking to do a re-write of large legacy applications. This is mostly COBOL going against DB2 for z/OS (v11). The COBOL code was generated using a tool, so we don't have any access to the source. Let's say the SQL cannot be changed for the sake of this question. They would like environments (dev/test/perf) where they can copy the existing data and test the re-written application (still using the same SQL) while still having a team supporting the legacy system through dev->test->perf->prod. Current SQL example: 

We have a table that contains the log record number for each database captured every minute. This data spans back a full year, or shorter if the database is newer than that. We have to watch the log record number to ensure it will not go over the maximum number of bits that it can have. Currently I'm tracking this information with a simple query and adding it into a spreadsheet. Sample Query: 

When run in Data Studio or any similar graphical query building environment I am prompted to enter values for both parameters, even though the values will always be the same for both. 

I have a query where I will be using the same value twice for one of the parameters. This query will be run under IBM Data Studio to see the results. Below is a sample query: 

For various reasons, I must use a SQLite database with a local application. However, I wrote a Flask app that enables users to more easily classify items in the database, and it runs very slow on pythonanywhere hosting (which I believe is hosting its services on AWS) because of the SQLite. They support MySQL databases, and I believe it would be a significant performance boost for my users to migrate the data to MySQL. However, I need to then pull the data back out of MySQL and write it back into SQLite to work with the local applications. My concern is that the BLOB data would get messed up by creating a dump script (it's binary pickled data that contains Python data structures the application works with once unpickled). Currently updating the local copy is as easy as downloading the SQLite database from the server. What is an optimal way to migrate this data to MySQL in such a way that it will be easy to migrate it back to SQLite? Should I? 

Suppose I have the following three tables: SupportTicket, Device, and Link. I've created these in SQL Fiddle. I want to display a list of support tickets within a time range that meet specified criteria and show a count of the types of devices linked to it. The problem is that my current query is duplicating Support Tickets rather than counting all the devices linked to it on one row. Here is my query: 

after I done this I copied the whole Oracle root folder to external hard drive I formatted the old server ...and I figure out that my configuration for which means the I only have database backup after I done this command ...I'm searching many online tutorial but I don't know which one is suitable for me I'm really confused...I'm using windows. 

I followed the Oracle help ...and I found out that My Oracle service ORCL is registered this is from Oracle support ORA-12520: TNS:listener could not find available handler for requested type of server Cause: None of the known and available service handlers for requested type of server (dedicated or shared) are appropriate for the client connection. Action: Run "lsnrctl services" to ensure that the instance(s) have registered with the listener and that the appropriate handlers are accepting connections. this is the output of ` 

I have recovered my Oracle database using RMAN after following this tutorial $URL$ after I have recovered the database I have created listener ORCL using NETCA ....when I run SQL developer it can connect to the database on port 1521 when I'm on the server ... 

Based on my knowledge MySQL is ACID compliance ...however hope this answer will give you more clearification enter link description here . 

my windows firewall is OFF !!!it's too bad the one who write this tutorial didn't talk about the listener recovery . I can ping my listener using the command ...the lister is already is started not OFF ...I really have no clue what to do . when I try to connect remotely using SQL developer I get the error "network adapter can't establish connection" ...while my SQL developer can connect to other database normally .
