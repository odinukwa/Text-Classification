Assuming you are in the United States, then no, as a general rule you cannot be prosecuted just on the basis of information you provide on the form. In the U.S. (and probably many other Western-style legal systems) there is a concept called corpus delicti. Basically it means that you cannot be (successfully) prosecuted for a crime unless it can be proven that the crime did in fact occur. A statement of "I committed a crime" is generally not considered sufficient proof/evidence that a crime has actually been committed, in and of itself. Of course, there are caveats. If you provide enough specific evidence for your statements to be correlated to an actual, documented crime (i.e. "On May 6th 2006 I stole a red Corvette with VIN number ABN23562303871QX from in front of the residence at 123 Some Street, Portola Valley, CA") then you could be prosecuted if they felt like doing the research to match your statement up with their records. Even in that case, however, they might have a difficult time prosecuting you unless they had their own independent evidence linking you to the crime. The only thing they really know from your statement is that you have knowledge of a crime, with nothing to prove that you actually committed it (perhaps you learned of the stolen car by way of a friend bragging about it, for instance). So from a legal standpoint, you can "admit" pretty much whatever you feel like on the application without fear of being convicted of the crime you're admitting to (though of course an admission of a major crime is likely to invite a follow-up interrogation), so long as you keep your responses vague and do not provide enough information to link your statements back to a specific crime. You could even go so far as to say "this one time, I like totally killed a whole bunch of people, it was so awesome!" and the worst you'd be on the hook for is making a false statement (which is taken fairly seriously in and of itself, in most jurisdictions; though if they come after you with that you could always just say something like "I was talking about playing Grand Theft Auto...video games count as real, right?"). Of course, I am just speaking generally about U.S. law, and to get the greatest possible accuracy you should consult a lawyer who is familiar with your local laws. I am not one. But from the standpoint of "what's the best thing to do to get the job", the answer is obviously a bit different. You certainly won't be considered if you say, even in jest, "I killed a bunch of people". The safest bet is probably to either just put "No" for all of those, or to admit to only minor things. Like "Yes, I slept with a prostitute, but it was at a brothel in Nevada and therefore entirely legal" or "I stole a pack of gum when I was 12. I know better now". Admitting to a major crime in a vague/general kind of way won't/shouldn't get you thrown in jail, but it won't get you a job either. 

This one seems a bit unclear. But if you're following Agile/Scrum, then presumably you're running backlog grooming and sprint planning meetings that involve the developers as a matter of course. In which case I'd expect the developers to give their input on the new story at that point. As long as the new stories aren't being dropped directly into an active sprint (which is a big problem in your Agile process if so), your process should already be built to accommodate this. In a way that's deliberately designed to bring all the stakeholders to the table to review and discuss the story before any work is done on it. 

Could be either, or it could be their way of evaluating whether or not to formally promote you (i.e. by seeing how well you handle the additional responsibilities, first). It doesn't sound like you've allowed enough time to decide anything either way. Depending upon your locale, the responsibilities outlined in your formal job description may have a bearing upon such things as your minimum wage/entitlements (for instance, Australia works that way, however I think that's more the exception than the rule). Or your employer may implement its own policy of position-specific pay scales (regardless of locale). In such cases, getting an employee to routinely work on tasks that aren't formally part of their job description can be a tactic employers use to reduce the compensation they pay. And I've had personal experience with at least one company that deliberately and methodically did exactly that, and on a very large scale. Outside of such cases, however, your formal title/job description is not a significant concern (apart from looking better on a resume if you can put 'Senior X' instead of just 'X'). Having more accuracy is always better, but not necessarily very impactful in most tangible ways. Generally try not to assume your employer is trying to take advantage of you unless you've got some corroborating evidence to prove it. Like if you've had the additional responsibilities for a year, performed well at them, but they flat out refuse to update your position/job-description or even perform an actual performance review. Otherwise you should at least start out by trusting them. To reiterate; my suggestion is to just give it some time, and if the additional responsibilities continue then bring the matter up at the next "natural" opportunity. Try to avoid rushing/forcing the issue. 

Devastation and destruction are being invoked on the basis that the candidate seemed to have a negative attitude towards women. That seems highly disproportionate, and is likely the reflection of bias. Consider what's Fair (to everybody) You also note that you personally would feel fine working with the guy: 

Always apply to more than one company at a time. Have a clear idea of how you would rank each company you are applying to in terms of preference. Schedule your interviews in order from the least preferred company to the most preferred company. 

Yes, although I don't think it's really correct to talk about telecommuting to a specific location. The guy in China could telecommute for the purposes of collaborating with his teammates in the U.S., such as discussing tasks, participating in meetings, etc.. Hopefully you wouldn't expect him to keep U.S. hours and his team(s) would be accommodating enough to schedule their meetings for times that are considered regular working hours in both locations. Sometimes that isn't always possible (time-zone differences can be tricky), but the more accommodating you can make the working environment the more success you'll have with your remote employees. Nobody wants to have to get up at 2:00 am for a meeting because some manager in an ivory tower decreed "all workers in all countries will keep California time". 

Say you had an interview scheduled with a company, and during your pre-interview research you discovered dozens of reviews on, say, glassdoor.com in which nearly every employee complains about the same problems: 

For the first half, fair enough in the subset of cases where that's actually true. The key is to involve the direct stakeholders, not everyone who might have an opinion. For the second half, I think you'd be surprised how intelligent and insightful your developers can be on a wide range of subjects if given a chance. If you've put some effort into hiring quality developers, then they're plenty smart. So why waste talent, and why assume that talented people cannot have insight into a broad range of topics? Besides, if your "business decision" is something like "we're going to change from being a platform that helps people crowdfund their favorite charitable causes to a platform that helps cigarette companies effectively position their advertisements" (to take an extreme example), your developers have a vested interest in knowing that sort of thing. And you have a vested interest in learning that you'll lose 75% of your developers to moral outrage before you make that decision. 

A good place to start is by documenting your current roles/responsibilities and any information relevant to each one. As an application developer that might not include too much specific information, but if there are any server instances that you manage you might want to consider listing the hostname, login details, configuration info, and similar information for each one. Similarly, if you're the keeper of any important developer account passwords (or details for any testing accounts, etc.) you should ensure that they are properly documented somewhere and that the accounts are transitioned over to the company if necessary. If your company has a password protected wiki that would be a good place for storing this information. Though check first in case they already have a policy about where this sort of information should be kept. You may also want to discuss with your manager and see if they'd like you to set aside some time to help with interviewing and/or training your eventual replacement, or if there's any specific information they want to make sure you document. 

Is your goal to make a fast decision, or to make the right decision? Occasionally there's a crisis that genuinely requires a prompt decision. But more typically, a business is better served by investing the time to make a good decision than it is by simply making a quick decision for the sake of making one. The latter is a symptom of a reactive decision making process that tends to see teams endlessly jumping from one imagined crisis or disruptive-context-switch to another for no good reason, and little to no productive work actually getting done. In any business, the cost of even a single bad decision can be significant. Thus it seems unwise to prefer fast decisions to good decisions. 

Yes. Or at least it's just as ethical as it would be if no promotion has been offered. The fact that they say they're trying to get you a promotion in no way obligates you to stay if you decide you'd rather go somewhere else. That really depends upon your position, your industry, your skills, your current salary, and your negotiation ability. I'd suggest checking a salary site like GlassDoor if you want specific figures. And I'd also suggest that you not frame your discussion with your new employer in terms of "I want $X more than my current salary". Just simply say "I'm looking for a salary of $Y, and I'm really not interested in anything less". If they decide to give you a hard time over that, then just say "thank you for your time, goodbye". 

A rumor is not a rumor when it's true. You're leaving because your employer acted unprofessionally, reneged on a verbal agreement, caused you significant personal hardship as a result, and refused to help mitigate the damage that they caused. It's not your fault that information became public knowledge, and even if it was I don't see that changing much. The company will continue to do the same thing to others unless something happens to make them change. If the natives are restless and they lose a few more employees over the matter, I think that's fair enough. Maybe they'll learn something. And in any case it's not your fault or your responsibility in the slightest. You've already made plans to move on, so apart from chewing you out there's nothing the supervisor's supervisor can do to you. The question you have to ask yourself is: Are you willing to lie to appease this person? Because that's the only way to fight the "rumor" now that it's public knowledge. You'd have to deny it, and perhaps provide a plausible explanation of what the "real" reason is. So basically, if you really want to fight the rumor, you have to start telling lies. Though personally, I don't recommend that you do that (if anything, personally I'd make sure that everyone knows that those rumors are in fact entirely true; but I have a low tolerance for unethical employers and in particular for the ones who think that the truth is best swept under the rug). Your employer has made their own bed. Let them lie in it. If your main concern is getting a positive reference, I think you have that in your immediate supervisor. She'd not have aired the reasons behind your departure if she were not sympathetic to your situation. So get her personal contact details and see if she'd be willing to provide you with a reference. I suspect she'd be happy to do so. And if your main concern is your relationship with your co-workers, suddenly coming in with a different story may cause more harm than good. In particular, publicly and loudly refuting your supervisor's story may cause a lot of friction with her. And she of course will know that you are lying through your teeth. Depending upon how she reacts, that could cause significant harm to your relationship with her and your other coworkers. So really, I don't think you should worry about the rumor mill or about what your supervisor's supervisor wants (and even if you did fight the rumor, there's no guarantee that she would ever see you as anything more than "that troublemaker who stirred the pot"). Just quietly and professionally finish up your notice period, and move on. If people approach you wanting to discuss why you are leaving, you can politely say that you'd rather not talk about it. Or tell them the truth; that works too and will kill any untrue rumors that may be floating around, just like the supervisor's supervisor asked you to do. ;) 

I think the best thing might be to take a pragmatic approach to the issue. I understand that it's no fun being lied to, or feeling that you're being lied to even if you're not, whichever the case may be. But set that part aside for now. The questions to ask, from a practical point of view, are: 

No. Generally that's the sort of thing that would be addressed in the context of an annual performance review. It would be reasonable to bring the matter up at your next review, and request that your position description be updated to accurately reflect the tasks that you're actually doing on a regular basis. However, it may not make sense to immediately request a review or to specifically request that they rewrite your job description outside of the context of a performance review. It's possible that they've given you the new tasks on a once-off or trial basis, and that you may not continue with them longer-term. Your job description is there to reflect the things you're routinely expected to do, not necessarily everything that you may be asked to do. So I'd say give it some time, and if your new responsibilities continue then definitely bring it up in the context of your next performance review. 

Be direct. If you want their opinion about current processes and suggestions about possible improvements, then ask them for it. If you just hang back, try to make them comfortable, and hope that they'll spontaneously volunteer the information you're looking for then I think most of the time you will be coming away disappointed (for all the reasons that kevin cline says). Which isn't to say that you shouldn't try to make them feel comfortable, and moreover, safe when you initiate this discussion. Let them know that your company is always looking for ways to improve its internal processes, and that as part of that it's standard procedure to ask any new hires for their opinions on any issues and potential improvements that they see. Also let them know that anything they say will be held in confidence (and keep your word and do it). 

Employee Entitlements Minimum leave entitlements within Australia are set out in the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System National Employment Standards). These include: 

How you get into that discussion is up to you. On the one hand, you could just go straight to your boss with it. That's nice and direct, but may result in a confrontation even if your boss is embarrassed about the punishment she handed down. On the other hand, you could simply ignore the punishment and keep using your headphones. If your boss regrets her actions then she'll likely just ignore it as well, and the subtext of "I will not be treated as a child" should be easy enough to read. And if she doesn't then she'll approach you and you can have your chat. In any case, you should be prepared for all of the possible outcomes of that talk. Perhaps she'll agree that she acted inappropriately and everything will be fine. Or perhaps she'll become even more upset, and try to send you packing (if she has that authority). Or perhaps it will become necessary to get her own boss involved. Just be aware that there's a worst-case scenario there, and be prepared for it. But it seems like the one thing you cannot do is nothing; based upon your reaction to the situation, either your employer needs to stop treating you like a child or you need to find a different employer who will treat you professionally. Harboring such a high level of resentment/"hatred" is not a sustainable way forward. You need to see if the problem can be fixed. And if it can, you need to be able to let that resentment go, forgive, and forget.
