You will have to allow time for mysqld to perform InnoDB Crash Recovery UPDATE 2012-04-25 17:37 EDT Diskspace is needed to write shutdown information into the mysql error log. During any mysql operation that produces temp tables (which are always MyISAM), diskspace is always needed. What happens if there is no diskspace for temp tables? According to MySQL 5.0 Certification Study Guide Page 408,409 Section 29.2 bulletpoint 11 says: 

GIVE IT A TRY !!! In the future, you may add another subject to or remove a subject from the student record. Here is another method using Dynamic SQL that figures out the subjects present in the table 

PROBLEM MySQL needs to be very explicit when flushing to disk in Windows. You have caught on to this when you did and You said you are using sync-binlog = 1. That's great. That only addresses half the log file issues. SOLUTION (or at least SUGGESTION) You need to synchronize all other replication components 

You need to accommodate a larger precision and/or scale. Here is an example as to why I wrote this stored procedure using your specifications for DECMIAL and NUMERIC. 

You should startup mysqld with log-warnings (it should be on by default) and also the max error count 

This will allow INSERTs into MyISAM without cross checking for free blocks within the table. This may make the table grow a little faster. As far as maintenance goes, you must use as not rely so much on on such bloated table. Perhaps you should think of moving to SSD. 

In PostgreSQL, the table_catalog field actually means something. In fact, it is part of the SQL-92 standard. The catalog of a database groups related metadata for a database. See, in PostgreSQL, the information_schema is only for the database you are connected to. In MySQL, this concept is blurred and the information_schema contains all metadata for all databases, especially if you have ALL PRIVILEGES on *.* as with root@localhost. It makes sense that it is there in MySQL but blank. The information_schema in MySQL will collapse for you if your DB user has ALL PRIVILEGES on db.* instead of *.*. In PostgreSQL, the collapse is automatic when you connect to a database schema. So, the table_catalog column is just there for MySQL to be SQL-92 compatible and nothing more. 

You can extract the SQL from a specific schema with the Use mysqlbinlog utility against all binary logs that have the data and time ranges. You will have to name the database you are extracting: 

Look at the column. It increments every time the sum exceeds @freq_limit (20) and resets. Now just run GROUP_CONCAT on object, grouping by 

This will traverse the entire table and recommend column definitions for every column based on the data it contains, the minimum field values, maximum field values, and so forth. Sometimes, you just have to use common sense with planning CHAR vs VARCHAR. Here is a good example: If you are storing IP addresses, the mask for such a column is at most 15 characters (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx). I would jump right at CHAR(15) in a heartbeat because the lengths of IP addresses will not vary all that much and the added complexity of string manipulation controlled by an additional byte. You could still do a PROCEDURE ANALYSE() against such a column. It may even recommend VARCHAR. My money would still be on CHAR over VARCHAR in this instance. CHAR vs VARCHAR issues can be resolved only through proper planning. With great power comes great responsibility (cliche but true) 

The politically correct answer would be that you cannot perform MySQL Replication from a newer Master to an older Slave. You proven the politically correct answer to be wrong. Notwithstanding, the correct answer is you shouldn't do it, at least not for very long. Consequently, I have a very strong warning for you: It can be very unstable and you should upgrade ASAP. Why ? The book "Understanding MySQL Internals" (ISBN 0-596-00957-7) 

This would only apply if you are choosing to query one id. If you are displaying multiple users, it gets a little hairy. You would have to sculpt the query for each column by searching for the field name in the list of public fields, displaying the field if it is found, 'Private' otherwise. 

While I would normally not recommend this To download and install MySQL 5.1.34, run these commands at your Linux prompt AS IS... 

This could just be speculation, but I suspect that if the I/O thread disconnects when it smells a binary log rotation in its master and expire_logs_days = 1, this bug might be happening because the oldest binary log disappears and a slave's I/O thread get thrown under the bus looking for a GTID value it can no longer see. You may need to do one of following: 

STEP 02 : Set Up Replication On the target DB Server, run the following: If you have GTID enabled on source and target servers, do this: 

These information_schema tables have been around since MySQL 5.1.12. Why the difference? To thoroughly demonstrate the difference, let me run an INNER JOIN of these tables to show which values are different. Here is the query: 

or just restart mysql Step 5 : Perform inserts, updates, and deletes on the LapTop (Make sure they do not conflict with needed data on the Master) Step 6 : run this 

an see if the CPU will level off. CPU is not the only issue. I also noticed your innodb_buffer_pool_size is only 4G (4096M) and you have 128G of RAM. From the looks of the processlist, you seem to have a full stack running on the machine. I would suspect that the innodb_buffer_pool_size is too small and MySQL (MariaDB) is spinning its wheels removing old pages and importing new pages in the InnoDB Buffer Pool. You have the room to increase it, because you have 109G (144515380k) of RAM free. RECOMMENDATIONS 

What you may need to do is remove from my.cnf and let assign the value it knows to . Then, restart . UPDATE 2018-02-28 08:24 EST You may need to add header in and put , like this: 

Since the tables you want to check are MyISAM, you can use just one query. For any given table or tables using MyISAM, here is that query: 

Your second question was well covered by joanolo. I would like to address your first question only. On , I answered this question : How to grant super privilege to the user?. In that post, I explained how the SUPER privilege was impossible to grant to a database-specific user. I clarified the difference between global privileges and database-specific privileges by comparing the table structure of and . To show the difference between them in terms of grants side-by-side, please run this query: 

Simply replace the with and you are off and running. Your Original Question Would you like to see a very wicked to fix all fields? Sample Data 

First of all, thank you posting the DELETE query and the table layout With regard to your question, there is nothing you can really do because a rollback is being done via the UNDO tablespace inside ibdata1 (it should have grown immensely). If you kill the mysqld process and restart it will just pickup where it left off as part of the crash recovery cycle. Here is how you can handle large and small deletes in the future: LARGE DELETEs Instead of deleting 70% of the table and create lots of rollback info, try copying the tables you want to keep.
