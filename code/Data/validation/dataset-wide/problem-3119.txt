"Everyone knows that having to fight on two opposite fronts at once is bad..." It can be, for sure. Everyone looks back to 1812 and Napoleon rather than 1918. Germany fought a two-front war and effectively won in the East with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The Germans also believed (somewhat correctly) that the resources gained from their occupied territories in the East had enabled them to keep fighting in the West. Hitler intended to apply and expand that "lesson" from the first war. Now, to think of invading Russia as "opening a second front" is to overestimate the UK's status as a "front". It was a "front" insofar as Germany chose to make it a front. When they decided not to invade in 1941, it did not become a "front" again until June 6, 1944. Yes, bombers and all that, but those weren't really a factor until 1943, at least a year after which the war against Russia was supposed to have been won. 

Your question is pretty much the theme song of the history of Western imperial expansion. Some places to look might be a general history of imperialism. Also a book I much enjoyed that deals with this topic is James Gump, "The Dust Rose Like Smoke: The Subjugation of the Zulu and the Sioux". 

Same reason the chicken crossed the road, to get to the other side. More seriously, the Schlieffen Plan depended on knocking out France before Russia completed its mobilization. Since Russia had publicly begun mobilization before the war, as a way of showing Germany its seriousness, Germany felt extra time pressure to get the job on with France. It seemed like a risk-reward thing, even though invading Belgium assured Britain's commitment to the war and the behavior of German troops in Belgium turned (Western) world public opinion against Germany. Another way to look at it is that there were two hands in Germany and one hand did not talk to the other. The political/diplomatic hand had gone through July 1914 making a bet that they could force Russia to back down from its defense of Serbia, isolate it from France, and otherwise create a balance of power that favor Germany. The Schlieffen Plan was not part of the consideration. When that gamble failed, Germany had to put its money where its mouth was, or face the same loss of prestige that they had tried to force from Russia. So the buck passed to the other hand, the military wing, which was now tasked with fighting a two-front war. Now the General Staff had great prestige, having won three remarkable campaigns in the 1860s to 1871, along with some impressive colonial war action in the 1890s to 1911. They said, "we need to go through the Netherlands and Belgium." The Kaiser took the Netherlands off the table. That at least going through Belgium was necessary in order to assure the timely destruction of the enemy in France was not a matter of great doubt. I recommend Isabel Hull's "Absolute Destruction: Military Culture and the Practices of War in Imperial Germany". 

In August 1939, while Japan and the USSR were skirmishing, Germany and the USSR signed a Non-Aggression Pact that allowed Stalin to put some more focus on Japan (among other things). By early 1941, Japan decided it was time to focus on securing its oil supply in Indonesia and so shifted to its Pacific strategy. Hence they signed a neutrality pact with the USSR in April 1941. Germany showed no signs of a policy shift until June 22, 1941, when it abruptly attacked the Soviet Union. With regard to the USSR, Germany was like "we got this." All through 1941 while Japan was prepping Pearl Harbor, Germany was wailing on Russia. When Pearl Harbor happened, the Wehrmacht was at the gates of Moscow. The Nazi leaders were debating whether to start killing the Jews right away, or "in the spring, after the war" meaning 1942. Likewise, Japan expected its expansion in 1941-42 to present the West with a fait accompli, that the USA would have neither the resources nor the willpower to fight, and that if they did, it would take several years to recover from Pearl Harbor and present a new threat in the Pacific. In other words, they could focus on China, and the USSR if they wanted, later. It did not work out that way. 

Finally, a political factor that is often overlooked: Before World War II Germany's middle class had no political home. Instead it was fractured six ways to Sunday. This had led to much political friction over the years, to the point of enabling the Nazi Party to rise to power by grabbing the votes of a frustrated middle class who wanted an end to the chaos. Finally the Catholics and the Protestants joined forces to form the CDU, giving it a solid base of political support to carry out the Economic Miracle. By the same token, the Communist Party was outlawed, and working class politics was united under the SPD. Political stability and the rule of law are seen as essential conditions for the growth of capitalism. 

I think you have to consider Hitler's decision in conjunction with his antisemitism and the issues with which he was struggling in early December 1941. 

Good question with several answers. First a nod to Lennart for pointing out that Germany grew just like France and Britain and the USA, so a certain amount of "a rising tide floats all boats." However there were some factors that advantaged Germany more than the others: 

Highly educated, savings-minded workforce whose population losses were instantly replenished by the influx of millions of refugees from former eastern Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Wartime destruction meant wonder years for the construction industry. Entire cities were destroyed and had to be rebuilt. Just fighting the war under conditions of scarcity and bombing engendered a high level of state-industrial cooperation and focus on efficiency and optimization. Do more with less. For example, Germany managed to produce more war materiel in 1944 than in 1940. Germany shrank by 25% in 1945 compared to its 1937 territory. Most of the lost territory, such as East Prussia and Pomerania, was historically relatively poor and agricultural. Silesia was an industrial region but hardly on a par with the Rhineland. Other relatively poor regions such as Mecklenburg and Brandenburg were sequestered away into East Germany. So the richest and most industrial parts of West Germany could grow without having to subsidize the East. Ludwig Erhard, the minister given much credit for the "Economic Miracle," astutely kept exchange rates artificially low in order to promote German exports. The Marshall Plan certainly helped somewhat by infusing capital. Rather than investment, East Germany experienced a net loss of capital and industrial plant as "reparations" but still managed to become the 7th largest industrial economy at its height. 

Hitler did not want a Munich Conference in 1938 or 1939. He wanted to attack Czechoslovakia and Poland on his own terms, and retain the ability to attack France at his leisure. His cold feet were about starting a major war, and mainly related to whether the German people were behind him on it. For example, he was resolved to attack Prague in 1938. Goebbels had been given the summer to prep the people for war, but by the end of September he could report no progress, only great forboding. An SS division paraded through Berlin on the 30th that was supposed to rekindle the spirit of 1914; instead there was glum silence. Hitler got cold feet, and got Mussolini to arrange the conference in Munich. Afterwards Hitler felt much regret that he had "given in" to Chamberlain and been such a coward at the last minute, and resolved not to treat with "that man with the umbrella" ever again. He invaded Prague on March 15, 1939 to complete what he intended to do in September 1938, and rip up the paper he had signed with Chamberlain. The goal in 1939 was to isolate Britain and France into a sense of futility that they could get someone else to fight their war against Germany for them, and to start the war in such a way that he could convince the Germans that it was a "preventive war" to liberate an oppressed ethnic German minority in Poland. Another way to ask the question would be, what kind of major war did Hitler intend when he invaded Poland? Certainly one that gained Germany its required Lebensraum without devolving into a Western Front style stalemate, one which required as little sacrifice as possible from a German people that he believed had risen in November 1918 to "stab Germany in the back" just as it was on the cusp of victory. Hence the Blitzkrieg, surprise attacks, and the brutal exploitation of occupied territories in order to prop up Germans at home. Sources: Gerhard Weinberg, The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany, 1937-1939 re: diplomacy. Goetz Aly, Hitler's Beneficiaries re: exploitation of occupied territories. Also recommend reading AJP Taylor only as example of historiography, not for the history written therein. Same with Shirer and Churchill. 

The overall answer is that the Soviets were not rich in railways and destroyed much of it as they retreated. The Germans anticipated this, and had railway commandos rebuild much of the Soviet trunk lines and some feeders to standard gauge. They also maintained several of the wide gauge lines if captured intact and with enough rolling stock. Some efforts, primarily in 1942, were hindered either by the inability of the commandos to keep up with the front, or by the low capacity of a wide gauge line. Source: $URL$
