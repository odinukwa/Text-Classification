Referring to Anna Haukioja in 2010, recommendation of oral probiotics for dental health purposes is not yet justified. 

Per AB Caughey in 2014, "there are a few cautionary items to review before we start inducing all patients at 39 weeks of gestation". 

"Typically higher luminance of positive polarity displays leads to an improved perception of detail" per Piepenbrock C et.al. in 2014, 

Other researchers have observed the same activities of the wild wolf acting as a family unit similar to David Mech's observations as mentioned in the below reference. 

Referring to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), there have been a number of recalls involving lithium-ion batteries/battery packs/battery chargers for use in cellular telephones, portable computing products, and other personal electronic products due to potential hazards. The Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) has identified 45 air transport related incidents involving lithium batteries and lithium battery powered devices and 113 incidents involving all types of batteries since March 20, 1991 which is described here. Several lithium ion battery fire safety testing reports are documented here. Also a detailed study of Lithium-Ion Battery Fire onboard a Boeing 787 by the US National Transportation Safety Board is present here. A recent example of a documented case of cargo hold smoke event by an electrical short circuit involving lithium batteries in a Boeing 737 (DQ-FJH) at the Melbourne Airport on 26 April 2014 is described here. 

Per Allessio Crippa et.al. in 2014, coffee consumption was not associated with cancer mortality and coffee consumption is inversely associated with all cause and CVD mortality. Per Yu X et.al. in 2011, findings from a meta-analysis of cohort studies show that coffee consumption may reduce the total cancer incidence and it also has an inverse association with some type of cancers. This study looking at major types of cancers suggests that the protection depends on the amount that was consumed. 

Molecular clock dating techniques estimate times of HIV-1 group lineages well before the start of Special Virus Cancer Program in 1964. 

However caution should be exercised since some studies such as 'Childhood Growth and Breast Cancer' in 2003 and 'Growth Patterns and the Risk of Breast Cancer in Women' in 2004 suggest that more rapid childhood height growth may be a factor in the development of cancer, especially breast cancer in women since dietary factors may promote more rapid prepubertal height growth, which may be a critical period for the development of breast cancer or other adult diseases. 

Per Kelly G.S. in 2007, "Oral temperatures are influenced by drinking, chewing, smoking, and breathing with the mouth open. Cold drinks or food reduce oral temperatures; hot drinks, hot food, chewing, and smoking raise oral temperatures." "Temperature is increased after eating or drinking anything with calories. Caloric restriction, as for a weight-loss diet, reduces overall body temperature. Drinking alcohol reduces the amount of daily change, slightly lowering daytime temperatures and noticeably raising nighttime temperatures." 

603 Squadron (City of Edinburgh) shot down 57.5 enemy aircraft which is more than double the average of other squadrons operating the Spitfire and also credited with shooting down more of the Luftwaffe's top fighters than any other squadron since 47 of 603 Squadron's confirmed kills were the Messerschmitt 109. Brian Carbury who scored 15 kills (along with Eric Lock) against Bf 109s and shot down 5 aircraft in one day to become an Ace in a Day was a member of this squadron. 609 Squadron RAF became the first to achieve 100 confirmed enemy aircraft kills on 21 October 1940. 41 Squadron claimed over 100 victories from July to Dec, 1940 which included six enemy aircraft destroyed and one probable in June 1940 and 10 enemy aircraft destroyed, 4 probable and 3 damaged in July 1940. Eric Lock RAF's most successful British-born pilot in the Battle of Britain, shooting down 16 German aircraft and along with Brian Carbury credited with the highest number of Bf 109 kills during this period was a member of this squadron. 

However, calcitonin gene related peptide are actually noted to be related to migraine and other primary headache disorders. It is also studied for application in pathologic and pain syndromes. 

"The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) redefined binge drinking as a drinking pattern that brings a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 80 mg/dL or above, a level accompanied by significant physical and mental impairment. For the typical adult, this pattern corresponds to five drinks by a man or four drinks by a woman within a 2-hour period." and definition of standard drink can be found here. First use of alcohol at ages 11-14 greatly heightens the risk of progression to the development of alcohol disorders per study by DeWit DJ et.al. in 2000. "Body of evidence, however, does suggest that early exposure to alcohol may set adolescents up for problem drinking later on, and that delaying the first drink for as long as possible may help to foster more responsible alcohol habits." The health risks of youth drinking per NIAAA are 

The risk of disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease is increased by the consumption of sugary drinks as discussed here. Research shows that sugar availability appears to be uniquely correlated to diabetes prevalence. 

She married her first husband, Dwain Wallace, when she was 18, and divorced him in 1994. She acknowledged in a 2008 divorce filing having had two children in 1994 while she was not married. In 1996, at age 30, she married Joe Davis for the first time. They divorced in 2006. The next year, at 40 years old, Davis wed Thomas McIntryre, though their marriage lasted less than a year. She re-married Joe Davis in 2009." 

Several other factors such as the national debt, interest rates, inflation and consumer buying trends play a role in the decrease of purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. However inflation is distinct from cost of living changes as mentioned by Paul Heyne in 2002 as "Inflation is not a rise in the cost of living. Inflation is basically a fall in the value or purchasing power of money. Looking at it another way, we can say that inflation is a rise in the money price of goods. You may even, if you wish, speak of inflation as a rise in the money cost of living. But the key word is money." 

Artificial stress powerful enough to cause quakes such as building dams, injecting liquid into the earth's crust, coal mining and extracting oil and natural gas from regions where there is high tectonic activity are noted to cause a massive change in stress load of the earth's crust which tend to trigger earthquakes. These earthquakes are called as induced seismicity. 

Colorectal cancer: A study by Sahand Sohrabi et.al. in 2012 did not support an appreciable role for using sitting toilets as risk factors for CRC. 

Referring to the advise from the chronic constipation patient leaflet of the World gastroenterology organization which has representation from 100 member societies with over 50,000 individual gastroenterologists worldwide, mimicing the natural position of squat may help bowel movements, 

These findings should be reviewed with a note of caution since Twitter security engineer Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, director of security intelligence at IOActive have studied the schematics of the 20 cars in 2014 and found that the 2014 Jeep Cherokee and 2015 Cadillac Escalade were the most vulnerable to computer attacks, while the 2006 Ford Fusion and 2010 Range Rover Sport were the most secure. Among the other cars that performed poorly in the testing were the 2010 and 2014 Toyota Prius and the 2014 Infiniti Q50. 

Scientific policy advisers for governments feel that sugar taxes would eventually reduce consumption of such products. 

Estimates of 10 per cent to 30 per cent non-paternity rates are massively inflated figures which contribute to the myth of high misattributed paternity. 

Yes, replication/duplication of fingerprints has been demonstrated through the following methods. a. Gelatin/Silicone: Description of the process is present here and it further describes turning a two dimensional print into a three dimensional mold. 

A systematic review of literature from 1950 to 2009 found that certain patterns of retinal haemorrhages were very common in abusive head trauma. 

Per Shai Carmi et.al. in 2014, "Ashkenazi Jews have an even admixture of European and Middle Eastern origins." 

Quoting Megan Scudellari in the Nature Article 'Ageing research: Blood to blood', "For now, any claims that young blood or plasma will extend lifespan are false: the data are just not there. An experiment to test such claims would take upwards of six years — first waiting for the mice to age, then for them to die naturally, then analysing the data." 

Per James Trussell in 2011, the progestin-only pill is less effective than the combined pill during typical use, since the progestin-only pill is probably less forgiving of nonadherence to the dosing schedule. Whether the progestin-only pill is also less effective during perfect use is unknown. 

Claim #1: The claim that Kambo, the substance derived from the secretions of Giant Monkey Frog (Phyllomedusa bicolor) is one of the strongest natural antibiotics is debatable since the dried secretions are not known to produce the same effects as the isolated biopeptides. Antibiotics are microbial substances that tend to kill other microorganisms or inhibit their growth through bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal effects. 

Similarly, cooking also produces burnt material that contains many rodent carcinogens and mutagens more than synthetic pesticides but this does not make cooking dangerous for health! 

The relationship of financial incentives to performance quality and quantity is cumulated over 39 studies containing 47 relationships in the study 'Are Financial Incentives Related to Performance? A Meta-Analytic Review of Empirical Research' ($URL$ Per this metaanalytic study, financial incentives were not related to performance quality but had a corrected correlation of .34 with performance quantity. Setting (laboratory, field, experimental simulation) and theoretical framework moderated the relationship, but task type did not. Overall, this study underscores the generalization of positive relationship between financial incentives and performance. It emphasizes the wisdom of designing incentive systems carefully; it also highlights the utility of including financial incentives as integral components in theoretical frameworks of organizational behavior and the management of human resources. 

Milk and yeast which are used as substrate for growth of viral and bacterial components are also noted to be potential allergans. 

Meat consumption is seen to rise in the U.S and EU over the past decade and the United States is noted to have a meat consumption at more than three times the global average. 

Department of Water and Power (DWP) confirms that this is safe and the 4-inch-diameter balls are made from high-density polyethylene, which is the same material found in a one-gallon milk jug. This plastic is approved to come into contact with drinking water. 

"Background color did not significantly affect visual acuity when studying the effects of color combination on the visual acuity and display quality using TFT-LCD. The results also indicated that chromatic background may be more appropriate than achromatic background (gray) for TFT-LCD work" per Chin-Chiuan Lin et.al in 2006. However, these results are contradictory to the findings that chromaticity contrast has a profound effect on visual performance, but matched with previous findings that chromaticity contrast cannot improve the legibility. Per the researchers, further investigation is required in the interaction effects between contrast ratio and screen luminance combinations on visual acuity and display quality with TFT-LCD. 

The immune system is a complex interaction of organs, cells, proteins, other biochemicals, and tissues. Research shows that only known or unknown pathogens, “non-self” substances causing allergies, cancer and illness can trigger or activate the immune system response and my emphasis is that tongue cleaning is not one of the known researched mechanisms known to trigger or boost immunity. Triggering the immune response artificially can be done by vaccination. It is preferable to avoid products calling an inflammatory response a boosting of the immune system referring to Mark Crislip. A tongue scraper is a tool used to help clean the tongue. No scientific data justifies the necessity to clean the tongue on a regular basis except for oral malodour. Tongue cleaning is known to improve taste sensation. Cochrane evidence for tongue cleaning 

Reading comprehension is disrupted when playing fast and loud background music. Per study by Ravi Mehta et. al. in 2012, "Most studies find that noise hurts creativity (Hillier, Alexander, and Beversdorf 2006; Kasof 1997; Martindale and Greenough 1973), there is some evidence that for highly original individuals, moderate noise may lead to improved creative performance (Toplyn and Maguire 1991)." 

The primary purpose of deploying shade balls on the surface of LA reservoirs is to protect water quality by preventing sunlight-triggered chemical reactions such as formation of bromate and disinfection by-products. The shade balls are also projected to prevent the annual loss to evaporation of about 300 million gallons of water from the reservoir's storage.
