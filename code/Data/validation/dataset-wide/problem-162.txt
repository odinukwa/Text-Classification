When reading "steampunk" and "internet", somehow I remembered how they do find damaged parts of telecommunication cables burried in earth: air pressure. So I have three more steam punk like data systems for you to offer :) pressure I can't deliver such fine answers like the other two guys who did so at this moment, but I may suggest that you could go for a pressure based analog data transmitting system. At least that would be very steampunky. It would be sloooow as hell, would need a lot signal-refreshers and of course need to be powered by steam pressure, but it might work. Biggest problem would be the noise-signal separation and correct error-handling. But for the sake of security, you could add some kind of gas that is unique for every "provider". And you could follow the pipes more easily than cables. capsules Alternative use a air pressure delivery system - just send punch-cards though it. Will have the same limitations as the pressured system, and needs... operators that shift these capsules from one pipe to the next one over longer distances. At the upside, you could mail slices of pizza and bugs would appear in a pretty other way... Finding out who did send what is a matter of reverse following a capsule and asking the operators, or look inside their protocols. semaphore Huh... if you do know the disc-world... they do use semaphore for transmitting data. Install a clockwork robot that does the transmitting at every station. While you could not send pizza, at least you don't have to worry about leaks any more. So... that might not be an answer to your question at all, but if you are willing to give up the 0 and 1 Internet for something more punky, than you could use this. Establishing a protocol for one of these would be... interesting. pipe-pressure would be hard to direct, but the capsule just need a adress written on it, while the semaphore could go for a dialing-system. More... may come later, if you seriously start considering this. 

by any chance, dude, did you ever play Dwarf Fortress (Masterwork)? Anyway... you may be unable to hide such notifications at a stone wall. Someone with much knowledge in digging who is not a dwarf should be able to tell, if a tunnel has been shaped in a way that is more than functional. Even if they do not know what this might tell them, they will notice. So why not hide your information in plain sight? My fortresses usually wont use such marks, because all you have to do is to find the central stairway, which you might reach by following the paths that grow more wide the more close you are. Well, maybe the size and dimensions could be used to tell this. But what I was thinking about from the beginning were engravings. I remember pictures from mushrooms and other underground plants, from animals, from (laboring) dwarfs and battles and creations of artifacts and even a masterful picture of red sand (wonder how this could be done at a gneiss wall without using paint). And not to forget the mega-beasts that strike boastful poses at the one picture and got struck down by Urist Whoever with his/her faithful steel battleaxe at the next one. And elections results, undead elephants, a brontosaurus in the food stockpile (uh, that one was painful). And pictures of goat cheese... well, you get the point. If you need another thing to think of, think of an Egyptian tomb. Hieroglyphs do look pretty to people who cannot read them, but the others do know, that you would get a instant-meeting with Seth if you step at the plates that are exact 2 royal cubits times 3 royal cubits in size. So if you choose this way, make your pictogram noteworthy in their appearance. No, make them overwhelming in details, but equip the dwarfs shown shoes with three shoelaces for a walking distance of three half hours, place a cloud that isn't raining for a way without water supply... well, no water is something a number of my fortresses would have been happy about. But some actually did die of thirst because the well did freeze in winter. Anyway. That's my offer: hide you information in crazy detailed engravings. But to be honest... labyrinth like fortresses would be pretty inefficient in a economic way. Beside the central stairway, my dwarfs ever build symmetrical settlements; most times in one axis, sometimes even in two, but when there is enough place even three axis (these tend to be the most efficient ones for some reason). However, most times you have to adapt your surroundings and loose any symmetry. Oh, if you send you explorers in such a fortress except them to find interesting switches in the middle of nowhere, the hidden secret fun containment room, at least one dwarf atom smasher, a quantum stockpile, exceptional statues of nothing, unexplainable complex drainage-systems (may incorporate interesting switches too), the upright spear training room and long suspicious hallways with well hidden stone-fall, cage and serrated green glass saw disk traps. ^^ Now strike the earth! 

Yes, there are many good answers, but either I missed it or nobody did came up with this, so another option: Laser. Its plausible for the timeframe; they think about doing this right now. Okay, it will use way smaller vessels (unmanned), but its said you could sling a small probe to the next star within some years. So lets assume they did think about a scenario where the ship does come back without any ability to break. Lets assume further they decided that using the laser-option to decelerate it was put into the ships design from the very beginning. All you need to do is aiming in the correct direction (at both sides). When I think about it... hitting something that's incoming with 0.6c with a laser over half a light-year of the size of a small spaceship will be... well, you need to aim really good for this. To be honest, I'm not sure that's even possible at all. But it offers you a fine plot point, if you are going to make a story out of this: That laser option wasn't planned in first instance, but somebody did remember how they did send probes to Alpha Centauri ages ago, so they install a makeshift-mirror at their vessel while the other side (earth) has the fine task to design a laser suitable for this task within a year or less. But at the end... all you need to accomplish is getting that ship slow enough to have it half-orbiting the sun... How to explain... make an u-turn around sun, and the earth can send all that stuff some of the other answers did name (especially a new engine). After all, no laser that wouldn't destroy that ship at the first hit would be able to eat away all the surplus speed. Just getting it slow enough so it would not fling out of the solar system at the other side. Sadly that will not yield any plus-points. And to be honest: that whole situation does sound like a job for Jeb and the Kerbal Space Program :) But they would use a rope and attach parachutes, than try an air-break at Jupiter. Well... if everything else fails... still no. Post Scriptum: Seriously, do not try to hit any atmosphere for air-brake at this speed - you could aim for concrete wall, that would not make any difference. EDiT: Wait a minute, just some random idea that lured in the back of my head since I wrote down the Jupiter-parachute-idea: Solar-Sail Its the same as the Laser: at its own it will never stop the ship in time, but you could try to use it like the space-shuttles did when landing to get some of your momentum eaten up before you reach the solar system. Well... you would need an incredible huge solar sail, and it would have a fun time passing through the Oorth' Cloud... at least you would make yourself more easy to spot for the laser-guys... 

fellow star-system-generator-creator. So HDE did answer your question as far as I can tell... but I want to offer an alternative, which may not be a direct answer to the question your placed up there, but instead is hooking into the "mass is not enough" sentence. I once had a similar problem, wondering what I do need to get a plausible star (and its star system) with as less data available as possible. So, if you are interested into abandoning the premise of knowing the spectral class first, keep on reading. Otherwise, thank you for your attention and good luck with your work! So... still here? Well, I'm going to be as bold as I can become and say, that all you need to get a "plausible" star is its mass and its age. Mass is required to determine what It will become once the fusion kicks in, how it will look, what the internal plasma flow will look alike, its surface color, its size and the duration of its states of life. But you need at least one additional parameter: its age at the point of checking. Without this, it will be a giant... quantum-like state, being a proto plasma cloud, a mainline-star and a super massive black hole at the same time. Wit mass, you know its potential parameters at each state of its life, and with its age you know, in what state of life it is at the moment you are looking at it. Take a star with ten times the mass of our sun... okay? How does it look after 4.5 B... M... come one, what was a "Milliarde" in English again?... Billion? Anyway, how would it look if its as old as our sun? Pretty black, I assume. But how would it look after about 500 Million years? Pretty blue. White-bluish... I assume. From this point, you might get the spectral you where starting with: Know its mass, you will know the durations of its states of life -> Know a mass and a time when you look at it, you may go for its current state of life -> From its mass and state of life, you may get its size -> from its mass and size, you may get its surface temperature -> from its mass and surface temperature, you may go for its spectral class. sigh Well, I went out of the topic when I realized that the star was the easy part of the work. As soon as I tried to apply different levels of pressure to the layers of all celestial bodies, my planets, stars and whatnot startet to go for abnormal values (I remeber one special "brown dwarf", which got to much non-fusion material during creation and ended up with a chronosspere as big as half of the star system... that was the point where I had to admit defeat because of a lack of knowledge). So, you might want to rethink your approach, but if you really need to insert a spectral class and get a proper star, my approach will be a bit... hard to use, because you had to create a dozend star(systems) and hope to get one which may fit your needs. Anyway, happy system-creation! 

sadly I can't comment yet, so I need to place my suggestion (which isn't a full-size answer if I'm honest) down here. So you want to capture an asteroid for mining and wonder if this is a good idea or might offer risks to high to try this? Why not looking at creatures that already managed to pull of this several times? No, not humans: Kerbal Space Program Some day NASA asked the developers if they can include asteroids gamers could try to catch. As far as I do know, this was done to find solutions to this problem no serious scientist or engineer would pull of. Thanks to KSP near to reality physics (well, atmosphere flight is a bit... crude), whatever did came out was something the real scientists could start pondering about. Just ask youtube for KSP and asteroid and you will find asteroids landed with parachutes, with wings attached, stuffed inside a cargo-bay, attached to a space station... While most of these are plain hilarious and sure no serious way to get an asteroid, some may work in reality. Some use extended GUI where you could read out Delta-V of their rockets, even the mass of these, the thrust employed, the distances they do reach, when they use a aerial break to slow down and so on... But yea, most are nice to watch only. I myself was pretty happy when my first probe finally slammed into the Mars-represenation of this universe, so I can't share insights from that game (but if you ever need to know how to haul a rocket out of fuel from an orbit using ropes and fast unwanted rotations of the construct necessary for this... don't hesitate to ask me ;) So... yeah, not an answer in the spirit of this site, I'm afraid of :( Hope pointing out to inspirational sources isn't a bad thing 

Heyho, if you happen to be able to read german language, have a look into Frank Schätzings book "Limit"... I don't know if there is an english translation. Anyway, its about a company that's basically the only installation on earth that is able to yield He-3 from moons surface, but they didn't loose all ties, because they made their head start by building a space elevator (which happens to be located at a us-owned island if I recall right). And... well, its a long time since I red that book. Anyway, please keep in mind that your moon-base will have a hard time being self sustaining. And at all you might need to do to put pressure at them is taking care of their earth-side operations. Just claim they do produce nasty weapons for groups that want the world see burn and install military at all their earth-bound installations. Now your group of 300 is just a bunch of people sitting at the dark site of the moon. All they can do is playing space-chess with the 3rd-reich guys who happen to be their since the end of world war 2 ;) Well, in this case they would be the owners of that place, because they where there before any UN-resolutions regarding the ownership of space came in place :P Okay, back to serious answering: Consider your renegade-scientists as a prime target for any nation with a considerable big budget for military. Sending a intelligent bomb (don't thing about the explosive agent... all it need to do is make a breach in their base' hull) up their if China, Russia or the USA (europe may have fallen apart until this date) get annoyed is something that any Kerbal Space Program Computer Player could accoomplish if he get the resurces... You could use an old soyus-capsule for accidential crahsing that building. Or laser them. Use them for railgun practice. Today technology isn't far from being able to reach targets this far. And as said before: while its kind of save on the moon, they can't do much up their if their earth-bound facilities are hold by un-peacekeepers (speznaz, usmarines... I can't recall the china-troups name)... You get the point. They need to hold something, the other nations are greedy for and not able to obtain to avoid such situations. Thats where we end up at He-3 which is said to be laying around at the moons surface and waiting for someone picking up it. And... yea, maybe you should read that 1400 page book. Or not. EDIT: Or read @Thucydides answer, which I managed to completely miss. Seriously, this workplace isn't healthy for my observation ability :/ EDIT2: Something to take into account too: They won't have much research ability up there. Collecting moon dust and stones and process them might be something doable, looking into outer space too, but installing seriously powerful research equipment... And don't forget about the communication. Using radio? Flood that site with radiowaves. Using an optical connection? Morse "who read this is dumb" in 200 languages with an earth-side laser and no one would be able to receive a clear message any more. And even more: if you are trying to be something outside earth nation community, don't forget that your pirate scientists won't fall under any UN-law any more. Thats like a free pass for doing all that stuff that isn't part of any weapon or inter-nation resolution. To be honest, I would not like to be part of such a installation, if there isn't any big guardian on earth... Oh, wait, we are part of the prime technology company? Wait, hasn't its posessions been sized by the financial part of the government because of taxation stuff? But one thing there is that might work actually: prospectors right of claiming land. Whoever can make there a living and gather resources first is allowed to use this land (until the country decides otherwise). Something like this might work; just don't tell anyone you are building doomsday-devices up there.
