Edit 2: Also, for what it's worth, I can't find any Campag time trial shifters which are any group set other than Record in any of their online available catalogs. It is common to only produce 1 high end model of specialty items like that, so they may only have made Record models. Also Record 10 speed TT Shifters are discontinued, so if you really want a set, get them ordered while there are still some available. 

Yes, a pedal can be reliably enlarged and retreaded, assuming there is enough metal surrounding the original threaded hole. Most good shops have taps for 1/2" and 9/16" pedals, which are the 2 modern standards. The older French standard is 14mm with a 1.25mm pitch. It is possible to tap out 14mm to 9/16" without issue, if you have the tools and a steady hand. Make sure you use the correct tap for the correct crank arm, as the left arm is reverse threaded. I hope that is helpful. 

The easy fix is getting new brake pads. The hard fix will be when they are worn down to metal and start to dig into the aluminum brake track of the wheel. At which point you will be better off getting a new bike rather than paying to replace wheels and brakes on a BSO. 

The nut in the orange circle is what you need to remove on either side of the hub, there should be no use for a hammer in this application. Simply use an adjustable wrench on either side and remove counter clockwise. The yellowish green arrow points to a tensioner screw, which helps to tension the chain and properly space the axle in the dropout so that it is equal distance on either side. The blue oval is an issue, your chain should not be doing this and i'm not sure how that happened. Is the chain off the front chainring so that it is loose i assume? I would roll the wheel forward and fix this chain hang up before removing the wheel so that your not fighting it when you try and slide the axle back and out of the dropouts, 

Assos Active Wear, the the Swiss cycling clothing company, has a specific, active wear detergent cleanser which is required to use if you want to maintain the very respectable warranty on their clothing. I've found it to do a great job with odor, and a good job with stains, if you use it as a pre-treatment on the stain itself. 

Until you get the hang of it, set up in a hallway, where you can brace yourself on the walls around you until you get up to speed and while you learn your balance. Other than that, you just have to keep trying. 

I used to make them quite a lot, but i always used sheets of sticker paper, you can buy it at craft stores or home office supply stores, it can be tricky to find but then it runs through your normal printer and has a peel-able backing. The adhesive is decent but not amazing. Vinyl is the way to go if you can find a printable adhesive vinyl. For what i used to use them for, which was outdoors, i would print them, let them dry and them coat them with about 3 coats of UV resistant clear coat letting them dry in between coats. That way you get a good seal to resist water and UV fading. It seemed to work pretty well, most would last more than a year outside all day. You can also buy sticker packs of random things off of Amazon or other online stores but the sticker quality is so-so and i would still clear coat them for outdoor use. They are what i used to sticker bomb my mini fridge and it worked quite well. 

I can't find a frame price, but there are good reviews on the Spot Coyote belt drive bikes, and the complete bike with belt drive is $1100 USD. They also make Ti frames with the same idea, but higher priced of course. I would expect that the frame would be around $450-500. Your budget might be a touch low, since any quality frame will start at this price mark, and go up, and isn't likely to include the belt drive kit, unless you buy the complete bike. 

It looks to be an older Currie Electro Drive, they were originally made in 1996 i believe. I don't know much to anything else about them though other than that is one and they exist. Here is the companies website which offers support options. I would look for a serieal number and call them with questions about battery replacement. $URL$ Also, i found this random page that sells parts, you may be able to source a battery and spare parts from them as well. $URL$ This looks to be quite similar as far as the motor mount and rack go. From what i can tell they make a very large battery pack that slides down the side of that rack and connects to those two metal terminals above the bicycles axle (the blue block). You can see them if you follow the second link i listed. 

Generally, repeated issues with broken spokes indicates either damage to the rim, meaning that the metal hoop of the rim is physically bent while under no tension, or that the spokes are at the end of their fatigue life. Any wheel has an expected use life, and usually, you will wear a track in the aluminum rim from braking forces before the fatigue life of the stainless steel spoke becomes an issue. However, if the the rim is damaged, as referenced in your previous question, then the tension of the wheel cannot be evenly consistent, because some spokes must be tighter than others in order to hold the rim true and straight. If our wheel is unevenly tensioned, it allows a far greater amount of movement of each spoke during the revolution of a wheel, and this stresses the spokes beyond their designed strength. And you break more spokes. If the rim is not bent, the same issue applies, except it is smaller movement of the spokes over a far greater period of time which has pushed the spoke beyond its useful life. 

One other idea in addition to the other perfectly good answers is utilizing a drop bolt. They can be bought but are also commonly made at home for situations like this. Here is a couple of images of different styles both store bought and custom made. Home made pipe style 

There are several forums that cater to vintage bikes, one of the best in my humble opinion is the Cabe - The Classic and Antique Bicycle Exchange 

In addition, in my opinion the best defense is keeping it clean and well maintained. Wiping off the stanchions when they become dusty in addition to using a proper lubricant designed for stanchions to reduce friction can go a long way for fork life. One example is Wet Seal by Miles Wide, there are a lot like it though. Wet Seal was developed in part by Suspension Experts who in my opinion do awesome fork work so it is what i would recommend but there are others available as well. 

12mm rear through axle with DT-1. 20mm Through Axle Forks: Insert axle through side dropout, through body of DT-1 and through 20mm ID spacer. Smaller end of spacer faces left side of fork (disc mount side). Push body of DT-1 to left until spacer contacts dropout. Secure axle pinch bolt. 

If you have a 32mm approximate head tube inside diameter, this is an 1 1/8" frame, assuming it is a standard headset design. An 1 1/4" head tube would have approximately a 35mm inside diameter. 

For me, and for many riders that come through my shop, the 11-25 is missing the critical 16t cog, which (at least for me) is the sweet spot. That is, the gear which I don't tend to spin out of, and that doesn't turn in to a grind fest. If I'm doing a Euro trip, then I will run an 11-28, with a compact front. But at home, for daily riding, a standard 53/39 with a 12/25 is perfect. For what it's worth, the 11t cog was designed to give a compact crank, with its smaller front range, the same or similar top speed as a "standard" setup, which at the time was a 53/12 maximum. 

Is it a road dropbar or a MTB riser style bar? These two images should prove useful. If it is a mountain bike style riser or straight bar it's quite simple. If it's a road bar most people (zipp) measure center to center of the drops. 

They come in a variety of colors from a variety of manufacturers. Thus is why i think this would be the most simple and cost effective form to adapt. You could simple attach the battery box beneath the stem or any area out of the way and zip tie the rope where ever you want it on the frame. you could combine colors and get creative with it quite easily. I know that the US distributor J&B sells them so most bike shops in the US should be able to get them, and ive seen them other places on the net as well. Their rather popular for customizing cruisers. Heres a couple images of them installed:
