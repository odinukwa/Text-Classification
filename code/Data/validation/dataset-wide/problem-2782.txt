Not that any member of the set that never transitions from not yet existing to existing is not a part of everything, a contradiction, and there was once (presumably) nothing, so all members of everything experience at least one state transition. Ah hah, no we're getting into the subtleties of grammar. Is the Statue of Zeus a concept? In which case, the concept still exists. Is the Statue of Zeus an arrangement of matter? If so, no matter still exists in that arrangement, but the actual nature of the arrangement still exists as a possibility. Is the Statue of Zeus a specific incidence of an arrangement of matter? If so, then that specific incidence has experienced in second transition into formerly existing. So let's take members of the set of everything to also have the following attributes: an arrangement (for concepts we can use bit-modeled neural arrangements) and an incidence. So every member of the set of everything has a state, an arrangement, and an incidence. Take anything to be a member of the set of everything that is either in the state of not yet existing or formerly existing. Then anything does not exist but is still anything because it exists at another point in time. Similarly, the corollary for space would bundle a location with a member, so that if the Statue of Zeus at Olympia were moved to say, Missoula, then the Statue of Zeus at Olympia would no longer exist and therefore not exist, even though a member of everything with the same arrangement, incidence, and state would still exist. Alternatively, incidence could be tied to location. 

There's is no short-cut: you must climb the Tree of Knowledge and see from that standpoint (or not). Philosophy can help, as it is nominally about Truth. You'll probably have to get a degree to have a seat on that perch. But the real quick path in lieu of that is to ditch books and dive headfirst into every challenge that is creating problems in the world. You'll eventually probably get stuck at the point between God and Science and get lost as everyone else. At that point, contact this author or go on a bigger adventure. 

WE ARE DIFFERENT. We are not only governed by the laws of physics, for when we act with awareness, we have personal agency. No psychologist or neuroscientist has pinned down the origin or seat of consciousness. The simplest conclusion is that it transcends (strict) observability because it is the subject itself being observed and this forms a contradiction. I really wanted to answer this with my robot voice. EXTERMINATE. 

The only "evidence" is by induction. The Law of the Eternal states that anything that can exist, will, given eternity. Posit: YHVH is the continuously-emanating singularity that we know as the Big Bang. As it is a singularity, it, perforce, incorporates other gods or demi-gods encountered within the Hebrew calendar (including the Christian one). Couple this with the actual first-hand reports and observation from the Jewish Orthodoxy, then you have sufficient evidence by induction. 

I know that, at least, in my moral theory, there's no action that can be taken to remove a life forms rights completely. However, developing life forms capable of sacrificing more easily and readily for the collective would seem to me to be a moral pursuit in an environment where sacrifice is necessary. In the case of the Restaurant, since technology should've developed to the point where sentient life no longer must sacrifice other life to survive, I don't believe there's any way the cow could be killed morally. In this case, I would use advanced simulation technology developed instead of the cow to convince people that they are experiencing what is described in the book, but are actually just be induced into a certain mental state. I think that answers a few angles of the question. Hope that helps! ================================================================================== Moral theory in question: 

So X either wants a license not to respect teachers, or the teachers to respect X. What X can control: X can show respect or not show respect. Strategy 1: X does not show respect. As X does not show respect, by X's own philosophy teacher's won't show respect. Therefore no respect is earned and no respect is shown. It is possible teachers may take initiative to show respect. I'm not going to cover that possibility as we know X has already taken initiative in this example. Strategy 2: X does show respect. As X shows respect, X is worth of respect. Case 1: If teachers operate under X's philosophy or similar they show respect to X. Mutual respect earned and shown. Case 2: If teachers operate under another philosophy, they may not show respect to X. X has earned respect but does not receive it, teachers have not earned respect but do receive it. Determining the optimal strategy then requires understanding pay-offs. Now, as the purpose of interacting with teachers is education, you could, for example, place a value of infinity on teachers receiving respect and a value of zero on teachers not receiving respect, as this should maximize educational potential. This would make strategy 2 optimal. If, however, education is not the aim, and minimizing cost is where respect confers a non-zero cost, then strategy 1 is optimal. I don't know X's utility curve, but this is the game theory beyond my recommendation. I do assume a non-zero value on education and a zero cost on showing respect, because that is the curve I operate under and was how I determined my own actions when I was in a circumstance akin to X's, and that is why I will always recommend strategy 2 as optimal. 

Yes, power on one axis/being would simply be distributed in time on the other. Given that they are eternal as well as infinite, the more likely scenario is that they're wise enough to negotiate the boundaries are. Since there is a documented story of one such infinite being gaving rise to another being, that is the likely trajectory of Man if and when He/She completes their journey of Knowledge. 

The problem of your question is the idea of "nothing". What is nothing? Is it some black blankness? Where does that come from? Is it absolute 0? From whence does this order come from? The only answer to your question is to posit a Quantum Sea of Unknowability. It is neither nothing nor any particular thing. Consider it like heat or Hiesenberg's Uncertainty. Or, you can view it like S in physics describing Boltzmann's Entropy where S = k log W, where W is the number of states, in the case of the universe is probably something like infinity, but you also don't know the base of the log, and k (the Boltzmann constant) is a bias in present science in favor of the atomic model of matter. So, in the end, you can't actually quantify it. Get it? 

There is not actually an infinite regress. There is a long, subtle, and biologically ancient regress that you have adapted to unconsciously and simply called it you. But the interesting point, is that what you call "you", is shared at some point, at what your partner calls him/herself. That is, that long chain is connected to your listener's chain. That is what the purpose of dialog is: to continue working each others way down each's respective chains of causal thought until one reaches and creates through linguistic feedback the point in common in which you agree. Call it a shared "cultural meme", but consider that since your perception and cognition systems evolved along similar paths, it actually gets down to shared genetic ancestry. It's very much like the correspondence of physics and math. There the universe co-evolved with consciousness, so that there is a point in common that makes the universe have sense and not be simply and blandly arbitrary -- which would otherwise be its nature. 

I would argue that there is an implicit trade-off between bias and decisiveness, similar to trade-offs between accuracy and precision. I take the following to be an unbiased statement. 

Good morning is an extension of your best wishes - a method of voicing support. Supporting your teacher should enable that teacher to teach better, unless that teacher is functioning under non-standard social protocols, and enable that teacher to better provide instruction. 

Consciousness: the state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings. (Thanks Google!) Well from a grammatical perspective we're certainly safe. I would hold the burden of evidence to be on the counter-argument in this case. I know of no non-egocentric reason to assume that thoughts and feelings are a pre-requisite for consciousness, or even that the human mind is a pre-requistite for thoughts or feelings. 

Now, should the added definition be considered as a bias? Perhaps, perhaps a clarification, perhaps it is meaningless. These are open questions. However, to me this suggests it is possible to refine statements beyond no position, to some position, to a certain extent, without introduction bias. I would argue that this continues only up to a certain point. To me, religion is beyond that point, but I do believe it may be possible to get down to a single a religion. I'm tempted to say only time will tell, but I'm worried that may carry with it my internal bias for optimism and progress. 

Well, there's a historical relationship, where science was under the domain of philosophy before the term science (likely) existed. And there's the logical or categorical relationship where both purportedly concern themselves with the questions of Truth. There's two main relationships. However, in the modern era, science has diverged from the study of Truth, to the study of replicatable phenomena -- a much smaller subset of Truth. 

No we wouldn't create God again, but God would. You have not understood a complex subject, because you're basing your internal dialog on ideas solely from the Christian world (that is the Gregorian calendar) as it relates to the intellectual one. Notably, it is clear that you have not interviewed an actual Jew who has a personal experience (distinct from belief) of God. 

Some statements can be bullshit in the sense that the presenter is merely giving you a "word salad". He's giving you the option to eat it or not. It's much like the fortune program on Unix. It just gives answers, to no particular question. 

There is no way to prove it, beyond the obviousness of it all. So one must choose to believe it because one likes it. That is all one can do. It's a particular aesthetic. 

Communism (and the understanding by Marx) is such a different type of organization, that it cannot be studied from a classical perspective. Few academics have really understood the core difference between communism and socialism, for example, or if they have, they have not commented on it. To really understand it, you have to see the "State" as a type of organizing force (from above), that is simultaneously the individual himself -- an esoteric thing that is akin to a meta-consciousness, and the people within it akin to cells of that body. So there is no taxation, just as there is none within your body -- it is built to maintain itself.
