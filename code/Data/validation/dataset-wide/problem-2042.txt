you don't really have to fill in the time with "inane" topics just for the sake of using the entire hour. As additional benefit, you won't risk being perceived as a person who needs to be micromanaged. Based on my experience in most of the cases half an hour is more than enough for a weekly face to face. 

To optimize your effort, I suggest you take the no response as a lack of interest on your profile and move on. If you really want to show interest in the company/position, give a call before applying and ask some questions about the role. In this way when they see your CV they will already have you in their mind, and you will be "oh, this is that candidate who called me...". 

I lost my mother and step father recently within 6 months of each other. I greatly appreciate the support from the co-workers that did reach out to me to say they were sorry. Some were simple gestures, some sent emails, some gave me something to read that was comforting, and others did nothing but stare with pity in their eyes. It's a tough situation for anybody to go through and any show of support is the right thing to do, regardless of company culture, structure, etc. This type of thing cuts through all of that right to the core of who we are. I suggest you show whatever level of support you would want in return, at a minimum reach out and tell your co-worker that you are thinking of them and to let you know if you can do anything to help them. I know I appreciate the support I got from co-workers, no matter the gesture. 

I don't think you have to fill the entire hour. Managers are normally very busy, and usually glad to cut some meeting short if possible. Therefore, once you have 

If your mind is really made up for leaving, there is no reason in playing with the fire and risking your perspective employer to doubt your commitment. If, as you say, it's the company tune that motivates you to leave, it is not an higher salary that will accommodate that. You are wasting time (yours, your current manager's, your future manager's) just to fiddle. If this comes to surface it won't praise your attitude. 

Stop covering the sh*t he makes. Let managers step on it and let him bear the consequences of his work. If you remove his accountability by filling the (alleged) gaps he creates, there is no way that the organization will feel the need to fix the issue. 

Spend some time with your assistant manager to observe and validate. Solicit 360 feedback from the assistant manager's direct reports to see if anybody else has the same issues. This also gives you an opportunity to turn this feedback into goals and expectations instead of giving a feedback sandwich. Talk to your assistant manager and have them give feedback on their direct reports. If you are close with your assistant, can you talk casually about it? I'm guessing no since you are asking how to approach the problem. Have a follow up meeting with the person who complained and dig further into each of the issues. Come up with specific ones that are troubling and dig into them further. Coach / mentor your assistant with one on ones. You can use these as potential talking points without letting your assistant know that you have been given negative feedback. 

No, it's generally not a good idea. In most legislation there is a difference between resigning and being laid off, in terms of access to benefits. For those I am aware of, being laid off entitles the worker to access social benefits such as unemployment subsidy, while this is not the case for resignation. And when interviewing for another job it is a different story having to explain a lay off or a resignation. Also for the company it can made a difference reporting workers have been laid off or resigned. Again, in my experience certain public funding or tax exemptions are not accessible to companies with a high lay off rate. Under this premises, you asking your company to lay you off sounds like a you are asking them to play the bad guys while you look like the good guy. Some may even take it as an insult to their intelligence and knowledge. 

I find simply saying "Thank You! I love what I do." goes a long way toward being modest. It also shows them you are happy and engaged, which will make any boss happy. 

The key here is who you know. Those activities are a way to get others to know you and be more apt to want to work with you. You do this every day with people at your current job. I'm sure people have left and gone to work for other places. Dust off your contact list and reach out to some of them. Networking is hard but every job I've gotten out of college has been because of my talent and because of the people I know there. Most employers like it when you have worked with somebody they like at their company. This makes the hiring process less scary / expensive for everybody. If you want to do any of those other things, do it with more than just a new job in mind. If you can take some time at night to learn a new skill, use that as your motivation. This will help you from being discouraged if the new job doesn't come out of it. Additionally it may open up a new position within your current company that wasn't available to you before. Also keep in mind that job hunting sucks. It can take days and it can take years. Just stay positive. 

hinting this to most of the prospective employer sounds to them like a "hey, change your entire Excel based workflow just to accommodate for my brilliant capacity with MatLab!". Together with soft skills you may lack or need to develop (as suggested in other answers), they need to be convinced that you fit in their organization, not that their organization can easily adapt to your way of working. And don't forget, of course, that there can be other candidates more qualified than you. 

Large company based in continental Europe. How to handle a project lead who refuses to use English in meetings, even though there are engineers in the meeting who are known to not speak the local language and have been hired with the only language requirement of "good knowledge of English, both oral and written"? Making explicit local language is not spoken and explicit requests to use English have been made and ignored. Addendum: Project Lead is able to properly speak English, and when asked why not using English answered that "using local language is more effective" (though somebody else has then to translate the content of the meeting) Edit: this is not a duplicate of colleagues not talking english, as the person having this behavior is in an higher hierarchical position. UPDATE Made aware of the issue, management has sent an e-mail to remind all employees that meetings shall be held in English. Reaction of the PL has been to move discussions from meetings to coffee machine stand up talks, still in local language. 

No matter what you do, do not take a large list of issues to your assistant. They are going to be blindsided and overwhelmed. Focus on a couple that are the worst and make a plan from there. 

You already negotiated and the new employer accepted. The time for negotiations is over. If you come back asking for more money again at this point, you are showing them that your agreement doesn't mean much and will put your trustworthiness in question. Additionally, they might change their mind about the contract and cancel it all together because of this. Chalk this up to bad timing. Work hard at the new employer and come raise time (or contract renewal) you should be able to negotiate more money based on solid performance instead of what you could have been making at your old employer. 

It sounds at best a borderline comment, as it implies that as a woman you should be more "decorative", which per se is not appropriate, as I assume the job you are hired for is not purely based on appearance. You should probably check what is the company policy on sexual harassment, gender equality and if there is any speak up policy about such episodes. Then, if you feel molested by such comments, take action. I would suggest such order of escalation (but this is based on the policy and culture of the company where I work): 

One of my former employer (and owner of the small company where I was working) drove to work 2 days after getting hemorrhoids surgery, when he was supposed to lay flat in bed and rest. Reason? He thought that without him watching on us we would slack the entire day and steal time from the company. As an underling you can do pretty much nothing about this: anything you may say can trigger her paranoia into thinking you are plotting something against her, ending up in making your work life miserable. If the paranoid behavior is annoying you and affects your working, I suggest: Short term: try to make visible what and why you are doing things to deflect her paranoia from you. Long term: search for a more healthy employment. 

I suspect that they are telling everybody the same thing (as other have said) you just aren't noticing when the others are reminded. It could be that others are being told more than once a day. Have you talked to other co-workers about this? Can you verify they are being talked to as well? Would that make you feel better about the situation? 

Short of specifics (you didn't give them but might have concrete examples), you really can't do anything here. It's classic his word against mine. You need to separate Dave and Bob. Move Dave or Bob to another team (if possible) and see what happens. I'd also reach out to Bob's other direct reports and get some feedback on how they feel Bob is doing with them. If he's doing the same to them, you have something actionable you can take. This type of management will drive your talent out of the company.
