I've worked on a number of Marin bikes and they are impressive IMO. Simple, straightforward design. Here's the bottom line. In this price range, regardless of what you get, you are looking at a Chinese-made frame built to "spec" (what the company wants). Then, various major-manufacturer components are bolted on and the bike is shipped. They are all really rather similar; variations in frame geometry are minimal, variations in component spec are also minimal. It's common to throw on an "upgraded" rear derailleur as this catches the consumer's eye... Costs the manufacturer only a few bucks more. Not that these are not perfectly fine bikes... The main thing you are looking for is fit, which you already recognize as important, and the best components you can get for your money. Most hybrids are made with a frame that leans more to the "road" type, with a straighter top tube. Most mountain bikes have a more compact design with a sloping top tube so that the rider can maneuver on the bike while off-road. The old "standover height" or "inseam" height measurements date to when road bikes were built with the standard diamond frame with a flat top tube. Modern bike design is a little more flexible. 

I don't know if they are still available, but it used to be you could buy a rather simple device... Likely not hard to make one. Essentially, a "star-fangled nut" was inserted into the bottom of the seatpost, and an eyebolt screwed into that. Then, a short length of steel cable ending in a plug that was a bit smaller than the seat-tube diameter. Finally, an extra-long cap screw for the water-bottle cage. Drive the star-fangled nut into the seat-post opening, attach the cable and plug, and drop it into the seat tube. Screw in the replacement water-bottle-cage bolt... Viola! An invisible security system. Or you could just toss the QR and replace it with a bolt; few thieves seem to carry tools... 

The two types of riding are quite different in terms of technique, and the bars developed for both over many years are quite different. Standard road bars, the so-called "drop" bars, have evolved over a century and offer a variety of hand positions for efficient operation under all conditions encountered on the road. Folks who "don't like to ride bent over" are doing it wrong. Mountain-bike or off-road bars vary largely by width; riders who spend a lot of time on tight, woodsy singletrack may prefer a narrower bar, those who ride wide-open trails with a lot of sand and such may like a wider bar. Other than that.. It's a matter of fit and comfort. A slight "rise" may be more comfortable, and a slight "pull-back" may ease strain on wrists. 

I refurbish old bikes, and it's very common for cheaper machines to have cables rusted badly...The better iron usually comes equipped with stainless and they normally look fine even if the bike has been sitting out in the weather for several seasons. 

It's unlikely the chainring was bent by pedaling alone... The forces are linear. However, if you were badly cross-chained and put a lot of pressure on the pedals it might aggravate an existing condition to the point you'd start auto shifting. As for straightening the chainring... If it's steel, no problem. I've done a bunch of them with nothing more than a crescent wrench. Get directly above the ring so you're looking down at it absolutely vertically, and tweak it gently till it goes straight. There should be no side-to-side play. If the chainring is removable, you can simply unbolt it and tap it straight with a hammer on a flat surface. However... If it's aluminum you might do better to buy a new one. Even a fairly small bend may cause cracking and eventual failure. 

Nashbar has been my source for years. Several times a year they have big clearance sales and you can find excellent deals. They carry everything from high-end name-brand stuff to their own labeled products. I still have the original Nashbar jersey I bought maybe 20 years ago.... 

As noted...It's mostly the motor... On nice flat roads with a good roadster...20+ even at my age. However, throw in some hills and a headwind and the average plummets. I have a 2-mile road course around the local park that incorporates 2 hills on each leg. When I was 15 years younger and in good shape, I could maintain 18 around that. Not now... 

I will say this as one who's been riding since the mid-70s (riding seriously, that is...)... Roadsters of that vintage tended to have gearsets that we would generally think of now as meant for racing. Maybe a 24-tooth low cog. I've often said that riders back then must have on average been manlier men or a lot smaller.... Now, low cogs running from 28 to 32 teeth are common, and on a lot of lower-end bikes you see the "extended range" gearset which features a low cog much larger than the rest. I think this is largely because the cycling public is now on average both older and heavier, and us older, bigger guys need low gears.... You can still get 11-24 cassettes, of course, just depends on how sturdy your "motor" is and where you're riding. Few will be able to flog such a gearset up an Alp. 

Direct-pull or "V" brakes are stronger, easier to set up and maintain, and are usually considered an improved technology. Well set-up cantis are not bad, however, and the pads do last a long time. 

It may be tradition, and it may be aerodynamics. Note that some roadsters do... Touring bikes have gradually been switching from the traditional cantilevers to V-Brakes. It's for tire clearance mostly. "Good" caliper roadster brakes are very powerful; A set of high-end Shimano jobs (105 or above) will lock your wheel and they are routinely used by pro road racers. They have a minimal aero profile and contribute little drag. They also look good on a sleek roadster. Also, you don't have to weld or incorporate lugs onto your snazzy carbon-fiber fork legs and seat-stays, which results in a "cleaner" appearance and less weight as well; high-end roadsters are all about weight, as you likely know. 

That would be my thought... Are you sure with all that work you've done you didn't get any grease on the pads or rotors? I would pop out the pads and clean them thoroughly with something like acetone.... Likewise the rotors. Then make sure the cable adjustment is good and the discs are centered... I am just working on the first bike I've handled with discs, so I'm doing a bit of quick research... These are the Shimano cable-pull models. The rear one is not centered properly and drags. 

Cyclocross bikes are also set up for wider tires, and are often equipped with cantilever brakes to accommodate them. I've got 28s on my old Euro roadster. 

Presumably you're wearing a helmet... Some are less "open" than others. I have seen some that have such large holes it would be possible to get leopard-spot tan spots on one's head. I think the sunblock is the easiest solution....There are very light skullcaps available but they're still going to be hotter than not. If you're not wearing a helmet.... Tests have shown that modern, well-ventilated models are significantly cooler than your bare head. 

The only caveat is certain types of Shimano chains which require special pins; they are extra-long and you break off the section after putting the chain together. A lot of the chains you get from Walmart and other sources have a "quickie" link, a special link that just snaps the chain together. however, you will still likely have to shorten the chain. Best practice is to save the old one and use it to measure. 

As noted by Neil. What's the bike worth? I refurbish a lot of bikes that are in need of such repairs; I won't bother with them unless I can sell them for enough to cover the cost of parts and such. And I do all the work; don't even figure that into the calculation. Shops of course must, mechanics have to eat. Are you planning to do the work yourself, or have it done at shop rates? Does your crankset have replaceable chainrings, or must you replace the entire crank? Idlers for the DR are dead cheap....IF you can find the right ones. If you're talking about an entry-level bike, I'd consider donating it and treating myself to some new wheels... 

Neil is right, most all "auto shifting" or "ghost shifting" is the result of cable-tension problems. If the cable is a bit loose, the derailleur will try to shift "up" to a smaller cog. If too tight, it will try to catch the next larger cog. Cables stretch, especially after a short period where the new cables stretch to the point they're stable. after that, they should be good for a long time. Try this. Shift to the highest (smallest) cog and try to pull the DR cable away from the frame. If there's a lot of slack, it's too loose. If it feels very tight.... With either condition, make sure the shifter is in the highest position, and loosen the cable at the DR and then pull it snug. Re-tighten the securing bolt and run it through the gears; it should be very close. Ideally, the chain should jump smartly to each cog both up and down, and seat solidly on the cog. If it's just a bit off, you can play with the barrel adjuster either at the shifter or at the DR. Another cause of such problems is a bent rear DR "hanger", the part that the DR attaches to. Some of these are very soft aluminum and can be easily bent. Make sure the DR cage is exactly parallel to the cogs and the hanger is not visibly bent. 

Some years ago, Bicycling magazine did a shootout on available locks and the Kryptonite "New York Chain" came out on top. Unfortunately, it weighs more than many bikes and is not easy to carry either. Fine if you can leave it where you lock your bike. I'm with the police department at a major university, and we have a program through Kryptonite where we give the kids a (heavily subsidized) Kryptonite U-lock for a mere 20 bucks. Over the 30 years I've been here, we've had only a handful of these locks defeated. Most all the bikes we have stolen (lots...) are locked with the sort of cable shown above. The thief uses a rather small bolt cutter and removes it more rapidly than you could by using the combination. The U-locks are easy to carry, not overly heavy, and offer a "good" level of security. Anything can be defeated with the right tools, time, and opportunity. Deny the thief these things and you have a better chance of hanging on to your bike. Or....Buy a beater and save your nice bike for weekend rides.
