Edit: This answer is now less valid since it was written when it appeared that the author was accused of doing something. Their later clarifications show that he's accused of not doing something - a somewhat different situation. But I'm leaving it in, since it may be useful for someone else finding this question and being in the position the question originally spoke of. Original answer There are basically three possibilities here. 

That's something that he may see as an indication that you're not going to be structured in your work and thus he doesn't trust you to do the job according to the procedures and standards that are current in your company. Also, it's a fair bet that he's picked up on your view of him - that he's less competent than you and that he's treating you unfairly because he knows you're "better than him". These things are likely to give him a view that you can't be trusted to do the job properly according to his/company standards, and that you're likely to try to show him up in front of both your superiors. Given this, why should he trust you? Suggested solution You need to win his trust. First: Respect Stop thinking you're better than him. You are certainly better at some things, but you're not better at all things. Not even all things needed for your job. Also, he's been there longer than you - this means that he knows more about the company than you do. You may be the best network engineer to ever walk the earth, but he's the one who knows what this company needs. That's more important than most of us like to credit. Second: You're messy - work on that. Use GTD, or Time Management for Systems Administrators, or whatever system works for you to keep some structure both on your time and your desk. Schedule time to do the boring parts of your job - documentation, feedback, managing emails... Show him that you are actively working to improve your behavior and to be a better coworker. Third: Talk to him. Ask him what he thinks you're doing well, what he wishes you would do different, and find suggestions on how to improve. Then follow through on that. Ask him what bugs him the most about the systems you work with. Come up with suggestions about how to improve that issue. Don't ever use the words "But why haven't you done $THING..." - that implies that he's stupid for not having done $THING, and will make him go on the defensive to tell you why $THING is impossible. Instead, make it a suggestion - "I've not been here as long as you, so I may be missing something here, but do you think that if we do $THING it might improve the $FOO issue?" Once you actually talk to a person, treat them with respect, and show that you're working on improving the areas where you're not currently doing well, it's amazing how much the relationship can improve and how much more fun the job becomes. 

I am currently working with a project manager and not sure about some of the stuff she expects me to do. As a developer as well as writing code, quite often I am being asked to perform certain other tasks whenever we face a problem. For instance the software which runs perfectly on server A is running really slow on a test server, we make sure that this is not anything to do with the software we wrote and it is hardware related, but then I am being asked to find out why that server is really slow and what can be done about it, I investigate this and find the reasons (i.e. hardware fault, wrong setup etc...) and then report this to her, she then asks me to come up with possible solutions (i.e. contacting the relevant departments and asking them if they can fix the hardware issues or re-install certain software etc...) and this is just one of the examples. I have already spoken to her about this and her response was that it is our (devs) responsibility to take ownership of the problems and find solutions. In my previous roles these kind of situations were reported to the project managers and they were responsible for contacting the relevant people and sorting the issues. My question is as a developer how much of these kind of none coding issues should be handled by developers? Thanks 

Let them know what you're doing to make sure that neither this nor something similar happens again.. 

It helps you keep track of what needs to get done, so you can be sure not to miss something important It helps your bosses know what you're working on It means people won't need to tell you things twice, as in the case where several people come and tell you about the same issue It makes it easy for you to report back to the person who wanted something done 

First, bribes. All rewards points systems are in effect bribes - they are an offering of reward when you purchase more things from the seller. Of course, usually they are quite small bribes. Most larger companies will have some rules about how to choose a vendor, and rules about what kind/size of gifts are considered bribes. (As a consultant, I know some companies that don't even accept a gift of candy around Christmas or Halloween... and others that accept quite a bit more!) The bigger the decision you can make is, and the bigger the gift, the more careful you need to be. Compensation and fairness thereof. If you are always the one who gets sent to the store, and you get a number of rewards points every time you go there, then you are effectively being given an opportunity to get monetary compensation that your coworkers don't get. They may or may not consider this unfair. If it's a huge amount of money (unlikely!) it may even be taxable. 

I am currently quite happy with my current company and role except the commute to workplace, it got to a point that I could not longer do it so I applied for a new role near my home and offered a new job. I then set up a meeting with my manager and explained this to him 3 weeks ago telling him that I have a new job offer and wanted to resign because of the commute, told him the new place expects me start at the end of January (I am on a 2 months notice and in the UK). He then offered me a chance to work from home which I said I would accept and stay here but this needs to be approved by the head office, currently I am waiting the answer from the head office which will come in the new year. I have not given a formal resignation/notice letter but verbally explained my intention of leave. I also explicitly stated to my manager if working from home option is not possible I would be leaving at the end of January, however now I am thinking if this was the right approach. I have now a few options: 

As keshlam says, the only way is to actually tell people that you don't want it celebrated. If you don't want to tell everybody, you can talk to your boss and maybe one or two more people that you trust, to make sure they can squash any attempt at celebration as soon as they hear of it (which they will but you might not). You don't need to give a reason other than "I know that everybody means well and I truly appreciate it, but I'd really prefer not to have any type of celebration". This is another instance where "No." is a complete sentence. They don't get to judge whether your reasons are "good enough"; only you can make that judgement and you already have. If it turns out that your boss and coworkers would prefer to pretend to care (by doing something you have told them you don't want), rather than actually care (by listening to your needs and not pushing something on you against your wishes), it's a clear signal to start looking for a new job. If they don't accept your boundaries on such a personal matter, they won't respect them on other issues either. 

I have quite a good relationship with my manager and really don't want to upset him/the company and want to part on good terms, which one of the above options is good or are there any other way I could handle this? Thanks 

Do nothing. If I can't work from home I will leave at the end of January (but if the company wants me to serve a notice period based on the date of telling me I can't work from home then this will cause a problem as I need to start the new place at the end of January) Write a formal resignation letter today explaining I verbally resigned 3 weeks ago and unless I am given permission to work from home I will be leaving at the end of January. 

First, you don't actually have to have any kind of explanation. "No." is a complete sentence. To be polite, you can expand a little - "Sorry, that won't work for me/us." By not giving a reason, you're not giving him anything to argue against. He can ask you to explain why it doesn't work, and you can repeat "sorry, we can't do that". He may be upset but there's literally not a single word he can take offense with. However, if you do want to give a reason, make it a personal one about your preferences. Again, this limits his ability to argue with you. "I'm sorry, I find it hard to have too many people around me early in the morning - one is my limit." This does give him a small opening; he may say that he'll be very quiet and won't be intrusive or talk - in which case, you fall back on "sorry, it just doesn't work for me". Should you come up with any practical reason - too far out of your way, not wanting to go at the same time, whatever - he'll have something to argue against, and if he can come up with a way to remove that reason (e.g. "but I'll walk to your house/suitable place so it won't be out of your way"), then he'll expect you to accede to his request. Giving him reasons is giving him something to bargain with, and will make him resentful when you don't fulfill what he considers to be your part of the bargain.
