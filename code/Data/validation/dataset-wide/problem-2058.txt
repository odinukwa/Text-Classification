Might be true, but unlikely, since as previously discussed the counter-offer is based purely on what the candidate asked for, not on the budget. 

This is reasonable, and it's why your arguments about coming in early and working lunches are falling on deaf ears. What he wants from you, and the example he wants you to set, is something other than working a specific number of hours above contract. 

There actually is a reason for your boss to decline to answer the question you asked even if the answer is "no". It's not always a clinching reason, but it's playing the longer game. You asked "are you aware of any discussions that have taken place that pertain in any way to my involuntary dismissal from this company?". You already know the reason not to answer "yes". If your boss were to answer "no" when you asked this, and then "I decline to answer the question" when you ask again 6 months later, then he has as good as told you the answer is yes. If your boss answered "no" to this question six months ago, refresh your CV. So your boss has two options that don't leak confidential information that he wants to conceal from you: always say no regardless of the truth, or always avoid the question. You know he hasn't taken the option that requires being prepared to lie to you[*], which is something, but gets you no closer to the actual answer to your question. That said, he could have explicitly avoided the question by saying something like, "any such conversations would be strictly confidential, so you understand I can't answer questions like that". But at this point he's deciding on the spot what he thinks will best reassure you. You really can't deduce anything either way from his response, unless you have some insight into his personality that he'd do a particular thing in one of the two situations, and he didn't do that thing here. The rule of thumb, and there are exceptions, is this: if one answer to a yes/no question would cause you to refuse to answer, then you shouldn't answer that question even if the true answer is the other one. So in this case, you don't answer questions about confidential management discussions. In its full glorious complexity, this issue relates to whether, when, and to what extent, a court or a jury is permitted to infer guilt from a refusal to answer particular questions. And one technique available to journalists is to try to lure someone down the path: "I don't suppose you've ever shoplifted, have you, even as a child?", "Of course not!", "Have you ever lied to the electorate in a campaign speech?", "Well, that's a very interesting and pertinent question, and I'm glad you asked me that. The thing is that my opponent...". Oops. Once you start answering "no" to that sort of question, you need to be all-in ready to lie, with all the risk involved in that. [*] Well, not strictly true, he might be taking the tactic "always lie to the questioner by exaggerating their value to the company, all-around talent, toothsome physical appearance, and fresh minty smell". 

This is possible worry, since it suggests that he believes the sacrifice of family time is in itself worthy. This might be a macho thing for him, much as some consider it more worthy to play through pain than it is to avoid injury in the first place. However, you only said it "seemed" to make your case worse, not that it actually made your case worse. Maybe he misunderstood you, and thought that you mentioned your early hours as a justification why you would never need to stay late, when in fact you mentioned it merely as a description of how you avoid frequently needing to stay late. If so then it might be helpful for you to re-affirm to your manager your willingness to stay late when required, just bearing in mind that you will continue planning to avoid it being required. To get promoted you need to handle this disparity between what you do, and what he thinks a leadership-material employee does. If his expectations are in line with what you're willing to do, and all that's happened is you've had a sticky meeting about it, then further discussion will resolve it. If his expectations are that potential leaders should be in work until 7pm and actively prefer not to see their kids, then you have an actual problem. 

As a Brit myself, I'd say that you should probably fix your spelling. I'd expect a USian living in the UK to have to do likewise for business writing. It's pretty difficult, but not as hard as a completely foreign language. Think of yourself as EFL, use a dictionary and a spellchecker and accept corrections from colleagues. If you can develop the skill to switch accurately between US and UK spelling and style, then you'll have a genuinely useful ability as far as formal writing is concerned. Outward-facing written communication should be done per a style guide, which probably says or implies US English, and if so then anything else is wrong. If there's no formal style guide then you should still be trying to find the company's voice. In the unlikely event the style guide actually says, "any dialect of English is fine", then when they remark on your spelling just point out there's nothing to correct here, they're wasting everyone's time banging on about it, and probably have work to get on with. Internal written communication can be done in British English, or for that matter in French or -izzle speak, but if people are raising it as an issue even in apparent jest, then it's probably worth fixing. Your accent shouldn't be a problem, though, unless it's genuinely unintelligible in a way that's affecting the business (you're not from Swaledale, right, and speaking local dialect?). Even the BBC doesn't have a required accent any more. For them to remark on yours is one thing, it's unusual to them. Be aware that a lot of USians actually like British accents, and of course are somewhat familiar with them from TV if not face to face, so they might not be intending to mock it at all. One thing to try is to play along by correcting them when they try to imitate you, and see if that leads to a more comfortable experience for you: "rock. No, not raack, rock. Not rorck, either. Rock". But if they are intentionally parodying it or otherwise mocking it then that's a personal attack of sorts. You have to judge how aggressive this workplace is, and what it tolerates. You'd think that sustained mockery of a colleague would be unacceptable everywhere, but it isn't. Extreme case, if you're working as an NFL player then your employer has worse forms of abuse to deal with before they get to people making fun of your accent. If you're willing to put up with it as a form of hazing that's just the price you pay for being foreign, then try to see it as funny and insult them in return. But if the workplace is basically civilized, then treat it as you would other personal mockery: quietly ask them to stop without making a big deal of it. This reveals whether they really were doing it in fun or in order to make you uncomfortable: if it was just fun, then they'll stop when they realise you don't enjoy it. If they don't stop, then they delight in making you uncomfortable, which means they're bullying you, and unfortunately you'll need to escalate. A civilized employer will want to deal with bullying regardless of whether or not you have any standing on the basis of a protected characteristic. 

In this case yes, but not always. Ideally, when you looked back over what you'd written you would have found one or more things that on reflection you realise could be hurtful, even though of course you never intended them that way when you wrote them. That's the hope, when bringing something like this to your attention without specifics. But it hasn't worked out that way. I will assume you're bound to respect the anonymity of the complaint, and hence you cannot be told which specific comment caused hurt. Granted, not all answers here agree with that anonymity, but this is not a criminal trial, or even an internal disciplinary procedure, and so it's up to the employer whether to grant it. I think your best move is to do what you can, and be seen to do what you can, within that system. Don't just say, "I won't improve unless you tell me who has accused me", that makes you look unwilling to improve, with a side-order of suspicion that you intend to be vindictive. It might also appear unpleasantly ironic to your boss, that your response to a criticism that your criticisms are unintentionally hurtful, is to demand to treat that criticism like a criminal accusation! So assuming you do anything about it at all, I think you have two good options here: 

That's a legal question about their contracts, but my guess is no. This being the UK, quite possibly their contracts say that they'll work overtime as needed. AFAIK such clauses are not held to mean that employees must make themselves available 24/7. Most likely their contracts don't say that they have to leave their phones on over the weekend in order to be called in at zero notice. Nor is it likely that their contracts prevent them making weekend commitments that would prevent them working even if they are contactable (travel, attending their own wedding, that sort of thing). With a team of four, you cannot get by on just hoping "someone" will be available and willing to come in on any given weekend. Even if everyone was willing in principle (which they aren't, but just suppose) there's a good chance you'll ring around and nobody is able that day. So if 7-day cover is worth having then it's worth scheduling in advance who will provide it each day. 

If it's just the title then it's personal. If the management are going to back it up, by actually giving you a different role from the less-senior developers, then that's another matter, but that could happen with or without a change of title. Just negotiating for a different title isn't going to make them give you a different role. If you're already acting as a senior developer, that is to say the mass of mere "developers" do already defer to your experience and skill, and perhaps you're paid at the top end already, then having different job titles to reflect different roles is more than just a personal thing. But for the organisation to reap any benefits they need more detailed job titles to be available for everyone. The fact they haven't done this suggests they don't see any big benefits for your organisation. Just doing it for you wouldn't deliver the benefits, and might cause serious problems, unless you clearly are the most senior of all the developers and therefore changing just your title makes some kind of sense. If that person at the desk next to you is clearly junior to you, and showed up one day with a new job title "senior developer" and yours was still "developer", I suspect that wouldn't make you happy. Your employer probably won't want to give you a title that's misleading in the context of the titles of your colleagues. 

Nothing you report specifically confirms this, but I suspect he considers the period immediately following 5 to be "core time", in which all team members should be available, at least sometimes. It's all very well putting in hours early, when hardly anyone else is there, but he wants you to be leading, and making yourself available, at a time of day he feels is important for teamwork. To be a leader you need to do more than make time for your work, you need to support others when they are working. That doesn't mean you need to be there every minute they are, but your boss sounds concerned that there isn't enough overlap between your overtime and theirs. Furthermore, if you're setting an example to people who come in to work at 9, then when you leave they will start thinking about leaving. They didn't see you arrive, so that time does not set an example. They may or may not have seen you work through lunch, but even if they did that might not set a good example either because not everybody is productive in 10-hour stretches with no break. Whether your team really needs a specific example of leaving work at a particular time in order to work responsibly, I really don't know, but it seems your boss thinks it does so you're stuck with that for the time being. The crux of this is what he means by "once in a while". When talking about unpaid overtime some people say "once in a while" and mean "one or two days every few weeks, perhaps several days in a row a couple of times a year". Some people say "once in a while" and mean "any time I say so, at no notice, which will become increasingly common until it is essentially every day indefinitely". If you have the latter kind of boss, then you pretty much cannot gain his favour other than by meeting his expectations or somehow changing his view of what a full time job actually is. So this is where the answer to your question lies. If your boss's view is completely out of line with your company culture then a reminder of written policy and/or a visit to HR to get their opinion of where you stand might be able to help you gently guide him towards (a) not considering it a bad thing that people leave at 5 when the work is done, and (b) finding other ways to use you as an example to others than just when you leave. Naturally, you need to be extremely cautious and diplomatic about this, because he won't enjoy his subordinates calling him out over it. However, if his view is the company's view then you're probably stuck with it. Also: 

So something has to give there. First, appeal to your employer to give you your legally-mandated 30 minute break. Just approach your boss describing the problem and offering what you see as the solution. "There's an important lunch-time meeting you want me to attend, but accounts have told me they're optional and I shouldn't charge them. I'll attend meetings where they're needed for my work, but I need to get paid and I need the legal-minimum 30 minute break. What time can I take my break, and what can we say to accounts to sort this out?" If that doesn't work decide whether to raise a formal grievance within the company. Somewhere along this process, they will explain to you how it is that in their understanding they are not breaking the law, which will help you decide how to respond. The reason grievances often work is that a grown-up: someone in HR or senior management, can decide whether your boss is being unreasonable. If account are saying the meetings are optional and your boss is saying they are not, then it may be that HR or senior management will agree with accounts. Often they back managers, of course, there must be a reason they made them managers. But once they consider the legal situation there's a reasonable chance they will overrule one manager in preference to setting themselves up to lose a future lawsuit. Internal complaints needn't necessarily be acrimonious: if your boss wasn't aware of the law, and accepts correction, and you refrain from gloating, then it might be over and behind you fairly quickly. If that doesn't work decide whether to take it up with the authority responsible for enforcing labour laws (who will also tell you pretty quickly if you're wrong about the law). I don't think anyone here can tell you whether or not you should back down and accept unlawful working conditions, neither can they tell you whether or not you should quit the job rather than deal with the hassle. We don't know how important this job is to you, but it sounds like your break is important to you and so you probably should not just accept it. Furthermore you need to be prepared to deal with a certain amount of run-around that might happen: 

Apparently a very flakey boss, who as well as being genuinely cool-minded is passing some of that flakiness off as cool-mindedness. I would hazard a guess that legally your employer is in material breach of contract, even if you don't have any realistic hope of enforcing the contract. How understanding and cool-minded would they be if you just didn't show up to work for a few days and then wandered in? Don't do that of course (tantrums don't help), but that's about as cool-minded as you need to be about late payment. There is basically no excuse on earth for not paying what you owe and not telling the person you owe it to, on or before the date payment was due, everything you know about the reason for non-payment[*]. You don't need to be grateful to your employer for valuing your ideas -- it's part of what you're paid for, especially as a senior employee. Your ideas benefit your employer. So be glad of it but don't use it as an excuse on their behalf. You should give credit for the general laxity, if it's unusual and it benefits you, and be somewhat lax in return. But that must be within reasonable limits, don't give them more credit than they're really due. Ultimately you aren't there for the lack of strictness, you're there to earn a living. So, you might well feel that since you value the company it's worth the risk of staying despite unreliable cash flow, and a reasonable chance that some day they'll run out of money entirely and you'll be left a certain amount out of pocket[**]. But you should assess it as a gamble and you should figure out how many month's pay you're willing to risk in this way before you cut your losses. To my mind that should be a small number -- partly because it's your living and partly because the more they owe you the more you can fall into the "sunk cost" fallacy. There are plenty of people in the world for whom it is 0, and I don't think there's any shame in being one of them. You should not threaten to leave until you're actually ready to go, because you shouldn't make an idle threat. Aside from being poor behavior, it damages your credibility for the future. You should let your employer know (not aggressively) that the unreliability is a real problem for you, both financially and in terms of your confidence for the future of the business. You could also ask if they're willing to make good the losses you've suffered as a result of late payment (that is, any interest or other costs associated with your debts). This will make sure they see the late payment as a problem for you and for them, not just something they can do with no risk and no cost. You don't have to threaten to look for other jobs, they'll surely figure out that if you're not happy and they're not paying you on time, there's a chance you'll find someone who will. You should look around enough to be sure of your options if you leave. And if you decide you want to go at a point where they're behind on pay then you probably don't have to work notice if you don't want to -- but you might never get the back pay if you don't!
