I wanted to write a comment to supplement the fine answer by @Chris H but it was too long, is important, and can pass as an answer. The literal "yes/no" answer is as ChrisH says. Chewing gum can moisten your mouth because the water is being taken out of your body. Some of that can be re-absorbed, but some will be lost. That is: by doing this you may feel better temporarily, but you are dehydrating yourself more in the end. Chris suggests this is a small effect, but I would say that depends on how dehydrated you already are. Severe dry mouth from dehydration can be painful but should usually be ok short term. I have had it to the point it was painful many times, to the point that it affected my sleep wherein I was dreaming about drinking as much water as I could with no relief since it was just a dream (in fact, I have had that exact dream many times; it is not uncommon when my mouth is way too dry). If you go for hours in this condition, assuming you are not keeping yourself dehydrated over the longer term of many days, my experience suggests you should be fine. I do not suggest that you be carefree about it, so please do not take that from what I say, as dehydration can be dangerous. And, as you probably experienced, it is annoying enough that it can detract from the quality of your hike. But in the long term, you should be fine even if you decline the gum, and I personally would decline it whether I was severely dehydrated and couldn't spare to lose a drop, or even if I was only slightly dehydrated. If you go all day like this and cannot stand it, personally I would rather relieve the discomfort by adding water from around me rather than relieving it by removing water from my body. In fact, you could make something similar to gum by taking a plant which is wet inside and chewing on that instead as if it were gum. Or, better yet, drink the sap from a plant then just chew on what's left of it. Of course, the usual warnings about knowing your plants and beware of toxic or poisonous plants applies. 

eat normally for 3 days (I'll assume 3 square meals per day), then hope that I can go completely without food for 5 weeks and 4 days more without dying, or not eat for a few days (assuming I'm initially healthy, otherwise skip this initial fast), then eat half of what you consider a normal meal once every two days, then hope that you can go completely without food for a few days more without dying. 

To dry an object, as you know you want the water to evaporate off of it and out of it. Heat is one of the obvious ways to do that. The dumbed down chemistry lesson However, if you increase the humidity of the air, you will indeed slow evaporation and therefore slow the drying process. The water molecules leave the object you want dry when some of the surface ones have enough energy to break free from the rest. To drastically over-simplify it, imagine the molecules as a bunch of sticky balls all vibrating around (think maybe one of those kid ball pits, but all of them extreme bouncy-balls, covered in slow-drying glue, and with a motor at the bottom keeping them all vibrating), vibrating hard enough that they are moving relative to each other (ie: not stuck in place like a solid). The ones that vibrate hard enough can break free from the sticky mess entirely and get away. The water molecules that do that become part of the water vapor in the air. When water boils, that is when all of them are on the verge of breaking free, and many cross that boundary rapidly. For simple evaporation, you have to wait as the energy randomly shifts around in the water until one of the molecules happens to get bumped around just right to have that kind of energy. Back to the stick-ball analogy: imagine that a bunch of other balls have already broken free of the mass and are wildly zooming around through the air because of all the energy they have. The balls trying to leave the sticky mass will have a hard time doing so if there are too many balls ready to knock it back in. That's kind of like how evaporation works when the air is too humid. The balls (or water molecules) can still get free of the mass into the air, but they now require even more energy to ensure that it happens at a reasonable rate. The ramifications (and crux of the answer) So if you raise the air temperature just a little bit but raise the humidity a lot, you're much worse off. In fact, I would suggest that keeping humidity as low as possible is more important than adding heat, assuming the heat is in small quantities of only a few degrees, or even a few tens of degrees. If you can raise the temperature while also keeping the humidity constant or lower, then that will help, yes. If you can increase the heat a lot though, then it is worth it. If you can increase the temperature of the room to a significant fraction of boiling temperature (close to 100C or 200F), then you're good... except that then it's way too hot, so you're not good. @JiK suggests in comment that some people do tolerate this temperature for extended periods of time, but you won't catch me sitting in a 200 degree F room for an extended time. I certainly could not handle that. So the answer, as long as you are willing to tend the drying process very carefully and actively, is to dry with a flame and get your fabric close enough to the flame to heat up a lot. But only the wet portions; you will ruin the fabric if you get drier portions near the fire too, or if some of it dries out before other parts and is still too hot. What I do sometimes is to hold fabric close to a fire, just out of reach of burning myself, until the water starts to come off fast and visibly as steam, maybe even making a sizzling sound, then I pull it back. That dries it out a lot faster. As for using propane, this might work with a propane stove, but I would be wary of that and way extra cautious. Keep in mind that as you are drying your fabric, the water coming off of it will itself raise the humidity around it. So if you are in a small, enclosed area, each unit of drying will be more difficult than the unit of drying that preceded it. 

Another good point inspired by the answer by @henning, adding my comment there to my answer: One of the biggest worries is that you would follow me. However, the following does not even need to be through any malice. I would worry that it was, but it is still awkward to be followed when nothing bad is afoot. I have actually had socially odd people follow me before and continue trying to be friendly to me. This is rare, but it has happened to me more than once. Sometimes I have even tried to get them to stop following me but they don't seem to get that what they are doing is not socially acceptable. In fact, after trying to be extra nice to this one guy one time for as long as I could bear, I outright told him that I did not want him to keep following me and trying to talk to me; he acted like I was the one in the wrong, and he actually asked me if I needed a hug... yes, that's right, I was creeped out by him, and he asked me if I needed a hug. And I truly believe that he was not out to steal from me nor to hurt me, that he was just a socially odd person. I get socially odd - I'm somewhat socially odd, but there is weird and then there is "I hope I am never in that situation again" level of awkward. Perhaps my experiences are part of what makes this difference between you and I. So being leery of you does not necessarily mean I think you are going to attack my camp at night. If you're creepy enough, sure, maybe that could be a concern too. But I do not want the potential for any problems, whether they be fear of burglary, or even if they are just you thinking I need a hug. 

Everything Else You need to figure out what you are comfortable with, and your weight carried will generally be a weight/comfort trade-off. Only you can decide where on that scale you lie. If you really like being toasty warm, bone dry, well fed, well watered, and to do all that with minimum effort so that you have more time to sit and admire nature, then you need to get used to weight. If you really like being highly mobile during the hike, and you are willing to either spend more time in camp-setup or not be fully sheltered, and have other niceties you don't mind sacrificing, then you can get the weight way, way down. Minimal Camping I am on the "travel lite, sacrifice comforts" side. I would be willing to take just a tarp and sleeping bag for shelter. Since I like to camp even through the winter though, the sleeping bag specifically I do not sacrifice on. Cold weather bag under a tarp is fine. Water: I'm fine taking little to none. Gathering and boiling; for me that is part of the fun experience but for others that might be a nuisance. Food: I don't mind getting hungry, don't mind eating some edible leaves, or even stripping some inner bark off my firewood to eat before burning the rest. My food expectations are low. I've been more than 3 days without anything but water, and I've been more than 24 hours without even water. And there have been plenty of times where I've gone a week or two eating only once every day or two days. The 24-hours-no-water was not planned but it wasn't terrible. Going for days on no food or little food is not exactly planned but I knew it was a possibility, and I was fine with it. I know plenty of people who would refuse those conditions: 2+ square meals per day or they quit. For fire, I'm with you on backups-upon-backups. I like to have at least 3 different ways to start a fire available, but I'll take even more if I can. I prefer ferro rod to start mine with a spark, but having lighters and matches available is a good thing. I had to use a bic lighter to start a fire once this year when the rain and wind were bad. The backup was welcome. However, my primary fire kit is just a tiny tin. It's not an altoids tin, but it's similar, a bit smaller I think, weighs probably a few ounces when full of my kit, and it's sufficient almost every time. I do not weigh my gear, but I think I would be fine with 10 pounds (that's about 5 kg) or less for a 3-day trip. I am sure there are some who would be comfortable with less. If, for some unknown reason, I could go on a 3-day trip I wanted but could take nothing but a bottle of water, a knife, a tarp, and my tiny fire kit, I would not let that stop me from going on and enjoying said trip. Also keep the specific trip in mind. If I were to go on a 3-day hot-desert trek right now I would take gallons of water, a few granola bars, and only 2-5 pounds of other stuff. In the desert I would be paranoid about getting stuck without enough water, so I would be willing to carry 20+kg (40+ pounds), almost all of it water, where someone else might bring a battery-fan and a tent. Maximal Camping On the other end of the spectrum, I sometimes camp with people who "need" so much stuff that vehicles must be brought to carry it all and you cannot stray far from the vehicles. Hundreds of pounds of stuff for a few people. Full camp stove, full kitchen set of pots, pans, dishes, folding chairs, folding tables, extra shelter to protect this mobile kitchen from weather/bugs, etc.. For them, carrying as much as they can possibly lift would still not be enough. Summary Make sure you can supply yourself with the food and water you need to stay fed and the shelter you need to stay alive. I think people should push their limits and try to live with less from time to time since that only makes us better, but each individual needs to figure out how light they can travel and still be comfortable and happy. Don't go with 2 kg of gear and have a miserable time just because I said it's good for you. Bring enough to enjoy the trip. If that requires 18 kilograms, so be it. Make your best guess, then keep re-evaluating. I'll close with a couple tips: An easy way to reduce weight without sacrificing is to research edible plants. If you eat the occasional leaf while you walk and reduce your packed food accordingly, you get a weight reduction practically for free. Second: some items are consumable, therefore some weight is diminishing - 1 pound of food is only carried on day one, 0 - 0.5 day 2, and it's not in your pack at all while hiking day 3, and similar for water reserves.
