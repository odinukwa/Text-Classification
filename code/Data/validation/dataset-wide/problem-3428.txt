There are different oppinions on which rates to use for calculating expected return (I assume you mean throu CAPM?). Most, however, do agree that it should be long-term risk-free, so 1 and 3-month T-Bills are going to be way to short a timespan. Usually you would go with 10 to 30 year government bonds. My professor in B-School recommended 10-year government bonds for a similar case. 

The sale of the bonds (assets) will only affect the assets-side of the balance sheet. If Acme bank did not lend out the money, your “bonds” would go 50-10 = 40. And your cash would go 0+10 = 10. If they lend out the money, bonds still go to 40 and lending goes up by 10, so 50+10 = 60. 

Increasing the gap between assets and liabilities is exactly the same as described above. Assets = (Equity + Liabilities). 

How, in practise, would that be different from what is happening now? ..or what you, as an "investor" could already do? No one is forcing you to deposit all your liquid assets into a bank account - most banks offer some sort of investment-opportunities, where you can buy into different funds with different risk-profiles. Next thing; suppose banks take all deposits and lend out to different customers for various purposes and they receive interest on those lendings - some of those interest are transfered back to you for allowing the bank to use your money. This would actually be the same, as putting your money into a fund. The bank "invests" your money with other customers and recieve some sort of yield on that investment (interest). Difference will be the risk-profile. By "investing" in the bank you recieve an extremely diversified portfolio, funding everything from consumer goods, cars, houses to actually backing large corporations. Most of your investment is being placed high up in the hierarchy of priotization if the lenders go into default, which makes your investment "safer" than if you go and buy bonds in that same company (but obviously also recieves a lower yield). Your proposal will put peoples money in a different place in the hierarchy of debt if customer/lenders go bankrupt, actually increasing the general risk-profile of the bank. In all everything comes down to your risk profile - which exposure do you want your investment to have. The risk of a AAA rated sovereign bond yielding -0.5%, receive 0% on your deposits in a government backed bank, 5% on a BB- mutual fund or 25% on an emerging markets bonds? 

I have been searching around online, but cannot really find an answer to my question. I can find a lot of material covering wealth inequality and how it has developed over time, but haven’t found any material to support my theory (or the opposite). My question is: Is wealth inequality actually a problem? With this I mean the super wealthy vs the rest (if that makes a difference). I will try to explain my thinking as good as possible. My theory is, that super wealthy people tend to not spend all of their money, they may invest it or set it aside. Consider a scenario where an individual owns 99% of all the wealth (i.e. money, disregard stocks, bonds etc in this scenario) in an economy, but spends roughly the same as everyone else in the same economy, effectively “disabling” a huge portion of the wealth. Would the “poor” actually be affected by this negatively? Would prices on goods reflect that “effective” wealth, or the total wealth in said economy? Another scenario could be where one person owns most or all shares in all companies in the economy, and everyone else living of of salary. Would this actually be a problem? I imagine that it is same as above scenario. Obviously these are silly extreme scenarios, I was just trying to paint a bit clearer picture of where I am coming from. If the super rich (or perhaps top 1%) have an average spending similar to everyone else in an economy, with the only difference that they own more wealth, would that actually be a problem; or perhaps in reality a smaller problem than how it is depicted in the media? I am not looking for political standpoints, but a more fact based answer. 

A previous and oft-heard question asked why no inflation results from the Fed pumping money into the economy. Are we simply seeing a methodical wage suppression, thus no official "inflation," while prices soar in certain sectors dominated by "shareholders," non-wage income, and the "one-percent" or whomever? The money moves first into the financial industry, where actual production investment is less attractive. It seems that as long as no money gets locked into "sticky" labor contracts, the Fed can pump away and the results are not deemed "inflation." The money does not cycle up in wages or wage-earner goods. In other areas, however, we do see soaring prices: art, luxury goods, high-end urban real estate, philanthropic gestures, political campaign funding, ivy educations, high-tech medicine, hedge fund fees, dividend payouts, tax-avoidance cash hoards, stock bubbles, etc. Can the absence of official "inflation" be explained in large part by the "disaggregation" of labor, middle-class debt, and a new class configuration since the late 1970s? More like a "redistribution" or even a "customizing" of inflation. 

Like many noneconomists who read about economic history and finance, I always remain somewhat baffled by the opaque generation of currency under the federal reserve system. My understanding is that the banks "loan" money to the government, which prints a federal reserve note or IOU signed by Treasury. But then what? How do the banks actually receive federal currency and/or credit... and determine the amounts they receive? My understanding is that banks can effectively receive as much money as they can "justify" by credit contracts, ratings, and a given ratio of leverage or fractional reserve. Apart from market forces and assumed prudence, are these the only factors that legally limit the amounts of money banks can receive? Can banks essentially get as much money as they say they can securely loan? 

Let me offer a "class-based" answer. Living in Manhattan, I see directly a phenomenon too little reported. There is inflation, enormous rapid inflation within the upper classes. Prices of luxury goods, multi-million dollar apartments, connoisseur items, first-class travel, artworks, ivy educations, rare wines, hedge-fund fees, high-tech medicine, philanthropic gestures, etc. The annual percentage increases are staggering. It is truly as if the money being pumped into the "shareholder" classes is being burned up at a desperate rate. Yet what is traditionally measured as "inflation" is sticky wage inflation. Only when wages begin to rise does the Fed slow the presses. High employment signaled by rising wages sounds the "inflation alarm" and a threat to the interests of the "shareholder" class. Credit flinches. So I would suggest that in many institutional, political, and social ways, there has emerged a class-based solution to the 1970s problem of "inflation." As long as wages are disaggregated the old type of "inflation" does not apply. You can print as much money as you want, as long as it goes directly to a concentrated, limited cartel. This, coupled with destabilization of the Middle East and military control of oil supplies, returned the U.S.from the 1970s "brink" to the sort of stable, wage-depressed, class-dominated economy favored by Andrew Mellon, Prescott Bush, and their ilk. As long as labor is disaggregated, it cannot democratize and "deteriorate" the value of increasing money supplies. 

John Stuart Mill famously remarked that labor-saving machines have not saved one minute of labor. More seriously, Marx argued, roughly, that machines can gain temporary market advantage, but cannot produced "surplus value," which come only from increasing attachment of labor. (Though Marx's value theory is complex and slightly ambiguous.) Nonetheless, observers, neoliberal and socialist alike, seem to agree that machines are "productive" and "labor-saving" overall. For neoliberals this is productive "innovation" and for leftists "technological unemployment." The idea of a future where "most work is done by robots" seems remarkably widespread. This strikes me as a fallacy for three reasons. First, in a rough adaptation of Say's Law, someone must obviously make, fuel, and maintain the machines. Someone else must, for example, mine the additional metals, feed the miners who mine the metals, raise the farmers who feed the miners who....etc. Second, the rise of "labor-saving technology" since the 19th century has come with a huge, five-fold increase in the global laboring population. The "local" increases in per-laborer productivity appear more than offset by the attachment and utilization of increased, lower-cost labor worldwide. Third, the idea of "robots doing all the work" would seem to violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Machines cannot run or reproduce themselves. The only "perpetual motion machine" is life itself. Without humans all machines succumb to entropy almost immediately. This would apply to any level of technology. I am not arguing that machines make no difference. But is this difference primarily local and conditional? Is the local "productivity" of machines primarily and irreducibly a way of displacing labor globally... and redirecting labor through "machines" from lower-cost to higher-cost zones? Above all, is it logically possible for machines to produce more "work" in total than goes into them? Again, even apart from issues about "quality of work," I am always surprised at how many people seem to assume this "robot replacement scenario" is plausible. P.S. Though I would like to respond to answers and comments, the "comment" function is not working for me at the moment, I have asked "Help" about it. My argument from thermodynamics appears to be misunderstood, I will address as soon as possible. 

Consider that you want to purchase a product from a EU country, pricing their products in Euros. Let’s say that you want to buy a product that costs 100 euro. No matter what the relationship is between USD/EUR, the product will still be 100 EUR. Let’s say the USD/EUR is 1.24 as in your example - that means for every 1.24 USD you have, you get 1 EUR. If you want to buy the product you will then need 124 USD to buy a 100 EUR product. Now let’s say that the USD strengthens compared to EUR and the new exchange rate is 1.15 instead of 1.24. Using same logic as above, you now need 115 USD to purchase that same product, giving you a discount of 9 USD just because of the new exchange rate. Remember the product is still 100 EUR - but you can now buy more euros for your dollar than you could before. 

Producers of corn may not be able to afford a decrease in prices. Remember that farmers are (usually) not speculating and not “investing”. They are producing a product that they need to offload in order to make money. They have zero interest in uncertainty (again, assuming that most are not speculating). The future price they can receive today may be better than the spot price in 6 months, or it may be worse - you really have no idea, but at least you can lock it in, so that you know what to plan for. Remember that farmers have two uncertainties about their product when laying the first seed: 1) quantity and 2) price. By hedging the price on some quantify you can reduce your risk significantly (and hence also your upside) which may be far more appealing then the risk of losing everything. 

Capital not being put to work reveals no profit. This capital could have been invested into something else which may (or may not) have resulted in profit for the bank. Opportunity cost of capital could be rather big. This means that the bank is actually loosing out on potential profits. Capital (in form of equity) does not necessarily mean the company is profitable. Many (often smaller) companies are 100% equity financed - this has no relation to profitability what so ever. Increasing the equity/debt ratio does not say anything about if the company is profitable. It could be because the company has build up equity (yay, this means profits), but it could also be because the company has gotten a capital injection (not affecting profits). It works other ways as well - perhaps a company is very profitable (building equity and not paying dividends), but at the same time they increase their debt, keeping the ratio constant; in this case you cannot see if it is profitable or not. Debt is not the same as “not profitable”. Actually most companies have debt because they may be able to invest the debt at a better rate than their interest rate (eg in machinery to increase production resulting in profits). 

You will then divide that by your interest rate, perhaps your average weighted cost of capital, WACC. Let’s say it is 5%. 

As you said it doesn’t make sense to compare entry level finance jobs with non-entry level normal jobs. Salary increase in finance is usually quite large - also many have bonus schemes, which many statistics leave out of the “average salary”. Over time definitely the Quant will make more than the school teacher.
