In my Islamic city, where medieval siege cannons are starting to be used, I'd like a better defense than just walls. I am proposing to the Sultan, that behind the stone walls we add a volume of packed dirt. The design of the cross-section is as follows. 10m high / 3m thick stone wall, backed by a compressed dirt wall that is just as high, but adds an additional 10m thickness, then gently slopes down to ground level at an easy 1-to-12 slope. If it's relevant, the circular fortress around my town is a ring with a radius of about 700m, heavily defended from above; no tunnels in the soil or anything like that. Will an earthen barrier make a huge difference, or is it just a minor help? Please don't point out the huge weakness, which is the gated entrance, unless you have an engineering solution (much appreciated): the entrance weak-point should remain not-relevant. Answers in magnitude of order ("it's a huge help, because..." / "not worth it, because...") are fine, but specifics are helpful. 

Descriptions of the tangential views are important here (because of the premise of the story), but I have a description that is anecdotal, that should be taken into consideration. When approaching Dubai from inland, the stretch of Sheikh Zayed Highway (a highway lined on either side with hundreds of skyscrapers) from Jumeirah to Umm Sequim is about 10 miles. The slight elevation increase and the unobstructed view of this thin stretch of skyscrapers can be seen on a clear day coming in on E-66 once you get about 15 miles closer to it. This is a clear, dry, sunny atmosphere as well. It isn't that the buildings are under the horizon, either, it's just that they're far away (or the atmosphere obscures it). So my guess is a 10 mile wide "tower" (or space elevator) would not materialize into your vision until you are 15 miles++ away from it, maybe a bit more because of it's "solid" nature in the sky. If you illuminate your Space Elevator somehow very, very brightly, then the dynamics of the horizon are the only thing important. 

Pretty broad, so I'll try to contribute. This is pure speculation for a broad question. Solar/Wind - This requires a low number of maintenance labor on production and distribution. The number of people who can do this job is a very, very low proportion of the world's population, I'd say 1:10,000 people can figure out how to do this job. Water - This requires a relatively low number, but there are more people, and higher skillsets, so let's say 1:100,000 people can figure out how to do this job. Oil/Gas/Coal - This, as stated, requires a very high skillset. Only 1:1,000,000 people can do this job. How that translates to proportion is up to you, but I'd worry about getting electricity if you go with a 95% death rate. In Portland, I get all my power from wind, but now there's only about fifty thousand people left in the area, so it's pretty likely none of us know how to maintain wind generators. 

The pipes you want your dudes to hang out in are NOT sewage pipes, you are thinking of stormwater drainage pipes, which can be big enough to hang out in, and drain (typically) downhill to a river or the sea. These are not always treated, and the only reason they smell bad is because bad stuff washes down into them. These are accessed by drains in the curb and manholes in the city have ladders down into them. The largest ("stormwater mains") are typically found under the main streets, and they're the ones you see people walking about in movies. For your story's sake, I don't think you'd find the stormwater pipes near a garbage dump because of contamination. However, you most certainly can have people in both places. Garbage dump populace outside of town and stormwater populace inside town (you can still call them sewers, if you like, but you might mention that you know they're not actually sewers). 

For magic to be known as magic, it must defy a known law of our universe namely that matter/energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Your magic wand must be able to create forces and energy, which is something that science and technology can never do on our planet. I can make a frog disappear just by my will, using no energy; or I can create a giant ball of fire without exerting anything but magic. Things that defy the conservation of mass/energy will be considered magical. There will still be science; theorizing and postulating about how something magical works in certain conditions, etc. and you might even get Theories and Laws. E.g. - McClure's First Hypothesis of the Magic Ring: if you point it at the frog, then the frog will disappear. 

Go Underground Not knowing much about the planet, my preference would be to start civilization entirely underground. I'm not sure if this is what @spacemonkey was implying. The entire city should be underground, and with the materials you've removed, features can be installed. Atmosphere/airlock - You have a potentially lethal environment on the surface, you can easily airlock your city. Protection - Unlike dome-cities, 10m of hard rock offers a lot better protection from any small asteroids: you don't know what might be raining down on this distant planet. Also, I'm not sure what the affects from radiation are at the surface, so this provides a modicum of cheap protection. Technology - you must have developed plants that do not require sunlight? "Sun"light can provide energy to surface collection, and anybody sick of no sunlight (most will have lived their lives in darkness or artificial light, no?) can hop up to the surface, protected, to get their tan on. 

Given an unlimited rocket without direct effects from the rocket onto the hero: In my story, I would like the character to achieve (1) very fast travel; and (2) very high travel. For instance, I have a part where the hero rockets to a height of an airplane, but then descends. Also, must travel distances. While the rocket is hand-waved, the limitations to the human body aren't. The hero has access to clothes you'd find in the closet (including ski gear), the 'hand-waved' rocket, and the helmet allows for 10 minutes of oxygen and protection from exhaust of the hand-waved rocket. But not space gear and not protection from effects of speed, height, pressure, or anything else. I can handle the storyline for logistics, politics, psychology, the rocketpack, etc.; this if about survivability. For the story, what are the speed and height constraints that my hero can survive, given that she can wear warm clothing, have oxygen for up to ten minutes and needs to fly around a lot. She will have to go far and high. Wardrobe is considered modern day, household items, upper-income western lifestyle. The hero has a credit card and knows how to use it, but is no Elon Musk. The only sci-fi is the safe, hand-waved rocket-pack and helmet with oxygen. 

Protecting Mankind: Sovereignty The CSA will likely dictate the territorial rights of different individuals and their countries. Most likely, this will include an extension of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which was eventually ratified by 62 countries stating all bodies are "...not subject to national appropriation by claim of soverÂ­eignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means." Protecting Mankind: Safety International safety standards for space travel might vary for each country, but I would expect them to be of the highest calibre, especially since the "space race" has calmed down a bit. Safety of multiple operators in space has also been discussed. One mechanism that works well is the dissemination of information between operators of peaceful, nuclear power. In my experience, there has been an enormous amount of rapid, international collaboration on design, safety, and issues in recent years. I would like this to apply to international space-faring nations. Protecting Other Bodies: SEA & EIA / PCR One progressive and successfully implemented strategy is to conduct a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) before planning initiatives on extra-terrestrial places, and a follow-up Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) before conducting the initiatives. The first identifies what studies should be conducted along the way, and the second is the studies. Both bring in expertise from a wide range of disciplines every step of the way and either avoid impact, or require offsets and mitigation to the impact. This is a very EU/UN procedure, btw. A Preliminary Cultural Review (PCR) is a system we undertook when working as a planner in Abu Dhabi (and I'm sure is applied elsewhere). This would work if there's life on other bodies. It entails a detailed review of paleontological, archaeological resources as well as any existing cultural communities or resources. It may restrict development, guide development to minimize impact, or make other recommendations to mitigate against the impacts of our space farers on other communities and cultural resources (if they exist). We already have strong protocol for human safety in space, but we don't have the same for our impact on the environment, geological systems, or (if there are aliens) cultural systems yet. But the language exists. 

Tremendous Direct Cost In Ruwais, in the UAE, cut and fill for a 1km x 1km (at a depth of 10m, including above and below the gulf bed) and all the associated costs, with cheap labor, came to about 1,000AED ($367USD) per m2 surface. Your land take appears to be 600bn sqm (3 "UKs") and about 20x the average depth. High-level estimate of 4,404 trillion (plus 20 % contingency for such a project) comes to let's round it to $5,000 trillion USD = 5 quadrillion USD (see comments). Associated Costs Now you can calculate the tremendous loss to trade, tourism, coastal real estate, and the administration and maintenance of this land. Was it worth it? 

Omnivores. But of course, they could be either three. I asked a horse-owning friend, who looked at me oddly (as usual), but told me about a book she read: Deadly Equines, documenting 4,000 years of meat-eating horses on every single continent (including Antarctica). She notes that some of them were in desperation - including human - during things like an expedition, but others are well documented cases of horses that eat meat. It seemed pre-cooked meat was best and most common, just like it is for us, but not exclusive. 

How about a hurricane? It's not unheard of for hurricanes to cross the Atlantic, pass over southern Mexico and continue into the Pacific. In our extreme climate change, one could very well gather strength and be pushed up to Los Angeles. It would require 'the perfect storm' of events. The drainage infrastructure is blocked by debris, so stormwater drainage is unable to be pushed out efficiently as the hurricane dumps enormous amounts of water (and a storm surge). Downtown LA is under twelve feet of water. A beautiful book, called Zaytoun, based on true events during Katrina, described a man who was able to canoe around his neighborhood and see fish and an aquatic world below his second story window, after Katrina (a very different set of circumstances, but true that it was a series of different unfortunate events). Unlike Katrina, Los Angeles is above sea level, but like many storm and flood events it can take weeks before floods recede 'down hill.' For the first few days, it was described by the person as like an aquarium. Later, though, of course detritus filled the water. 

Uh.. you can do this now if you want. Start with your phytoplankton, which get their energy from the sun, and move up the food chain with the kinds of plankton that eat them. Continue up the food chain. For the types of fish we can eat, that reproduce quickly, I wouldn't go with just "one successful type," but rather a wide-variety in order to maintain a healthy ecosystem. The amount depends on the population you're sustaining. You may want to (cringe) milk the mammals to add to the diet; dolphins, for example, produce high fat milks. Or you can have predatory land mammals who eat fish, and get your extra nutrients from them. There are groups of people, particularly some Brahmin, who stick to pescetarianism and milk. 

I gave this a quick test on sandbox, and agreed with the comment that I should steer away from the physics part and focus on the geology, etc. Assuming Europa's ice crust is 10km thick as some speculate, and my explorers bore a drill-hole 1m in radius to the salt water below, would that create some kind of rupture, geyser or blast from a release of great pressure, or would it be more like ice-fishing, where I can drop equipment many kilometers down to the water section? 

Let's approach it the way we can (generalize) human music. I can find nothing on badger behavior towards music, so this is all just speculation. Also, badger humans don't exist (yet?). Dwellings Badgers live in underground dwelling units that are tightly knit. This could suggest a large interest in community and cooperation in tough times and good. This could also suggest a little bit less on the bass, because you'd be shaking dirt all over the place. Diet Diet of a badger is largely known to eat bugs to small mammals. This helps me in no way. Precedents Mr. Badger was a grumpy, but wise character who pointed out the realities of the world to an arguably naive character in the Wind in the Willows. Geography Badgers are primarily found in North America, Britain, and Ireland, but can be found in many other places. Society I am guessing that Badger-People might feel marginalized from both human and badger populations. From those five generalizations, I would put their favorite to be Alt-Country. Brit/US Indie [Geography] music with a realist, sometimes sad slant [Mr Badger]; a bit of alternative feel [Society], a hint of bluegrass [Diet], a social component [Dwelling], and not too much bass [underground Dwelling]. While it is not my favorite music, but I'd call it Indie/Alt/Country/Bluegrass. That is broad speculation. 

This website describes how to make wine in a pinch( I'm opening a wine bar, so full disclosure: I don't recommend this wine to anyone). Summary: 

TL;DR: A Bigger Multnomah Falls Yes, I think all of this is possible. I'm trying to visualize your construct. Consider something like Multnomah Falls. At a rate of 4m3/second you can have make a tiered waterfall (see image). Unlike Multnomah Falls, your ascent should not be so easily undertaken - the cliffs should be higher and sheer. Where there is a bridge here is where your tunnel is. Where it says 4m3/sec you want significantly more. The source of these falls is mostly a freshwater artesian spring, augmented by some snow melt; but it maintains a seasonal flow. You very well could have the same setup. When the settlements upstream (above the top of the falls) accidentally re-route the river, it simply goes down the other side of their high plateau. This makes it much easier, since they simply have to reroute from the source of the springs, which may be closer to the other side of their 'mountain'. The steepness and size of your mountain is no longer restricted to the waterfall's design and source but you must now consider how your mountain functions where people cannot come up or go down it. Perhaps your mountain is really a plateau like Mount Roraima? But with a natural river and springs. EDIT: A waterfall occurs (usually) when the river has worn out the softer stone around harder, igneous stone. The harder stone remains meaning the water goes over it instead of wearing it away as well. On your plateau mountain, the tunnel could have been caused by having a patch of softer stone in the center of harder stone (like granite). It is not unusual for magma to create weird stone formations of hard stone through soft stone like limestone. In this image, the volcanic igneous rock will remain one day long after the limestone washes or 'blows' away to processes. In your mountain, you have a volcanic tube and flow that created a wall with a hole in it, with sandstone or limestone in it millions of years ago. Over the millenia the river disolved the soft stone allowing for a ring or tunnel through which your waterfall now travels.
