In more plain English, people with unhealthy behaviors may be more likely to lose their jobs; Alcoholism can get you fired and lead to an early grave, but getting fired wasn't what killed you. A third reason to take this with a grain of salt is that when unemployment increases, underemployment increases as well. This logic may exclude some number of people who die after they take two crappy part time jobs after they lose their one good job. Those people are not counted in the U3 unemployment rate. If your child or spouse dies after you lose your job and your health insurance, that death would also not be counted. 

The paper uses a quote from another paper to explain why the evidence might be conflicting and messy. 

This government report presents data on felony defendants in America's 75 largest counties. These counties contain large cities accounting for 37% of the total population, and are not nationally representative. In 2009 in the 75 largest urban counties there were 412 felony rape defendants, of which 68% were convicted of something, 57% (235) were convicted of a felony, the rest a misdemeanor. The infographic claims that of the 11 cases referred to a prosecutor, 7 of them will result in a felony conviction. The two sources have a similar felony conviction rate; The difference could be explained by rounding errors in the 7 and 11 or it could be that RAINN took the average of several years of data.

Reading through their advertising claims, I am having a hard time determining what exactly it means to be 72.3% Northern European, or 24% Ghana/Ivory Coast. At what point in history was there an archetypal group of people who were 100% Ivory Coast? My historical knowledge of human migration and population growth is pretty spotty, but I am under the impression that it was a very messy process. Their site has a veneer of science, but is clearly targeted at a lay audience. This question could be improved by finding a scientific discussion of what the company's scientists think their ancestry reports mean. I am skeptical of the claims partly because they seem difficult to falsify. If a DNA test says that my ancestors are 19% asian, who can argue with that? The ancestors in question are dead. What evidence shows that the DNA tests from 23andMe and AncestryDNA provide accurate and meaningful results? Is this evidence sufficient to justify their claims? Note: I have to tip my hat to @Statsanalyst who originally asked a similar question that lacked a specific answerable claim. 

Humans (like other primates) have long squatted during childbirth. The use of a birthing stool to aid the upright birthing position was also common for centuries, and is still used today. I couldn't find any sources linking the use of squatting toilets to childbirth. However, squatting to urinate/defecate isn't uncommon in undeveloped countries; these are also the countries most likely to utilize squatting for childbirth. As far as the mechanism for utilizing a squatting position it's said that the pelvic outlet is larger in the squatting position - thus more room for the child to deliver. There's also less compression upon arteries while squatting as opposed to being supine. It is also suggested that gravity is a factor: the weight of the baby dropping onto the cervix to speed dialation: most reports I linked show that squatting births were in general faster but some studies report more tearing and bloodloss with the squatting position. ($URL$ - for whatever reason that link won't link for me today. The basic conclusion from most reports: whatever position which makes Mom happy and comfortable while trying to squeeze a bowling ball out of a hole the size of a lemon is the best choice. 

Yes, there are studies which show a correlation between methylmercury exposure and attention deficits. One of the 'cornerstone' mercury studies was performed in the Faroe Islands by Grandjean, et al 1999, (Methylmercury exposure biomarkers as indicators of neurotoxicity in children aged 7 years ) where they followed a cohort of 917 Faroese children from birth until the age of 7, which reported 

Is formaldehyde the sole source of the 'new car smell'? No. It's more than likely the combined smell of the VOC's (of which formaldehyde is one) emitting from the interior, as there's over a dozen VOC's which are present. Brown, Stephen K and Min Cheng, 2007. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in New Car Interiors They found that the amount of VOCs present is dependent upon the 'delivery time' of the car from the manufacturer. Those cars which didn't have a 'shelf life' at a dealership had the highest amounts of VOCs present. Those which had been on display outside had the lowest. The chemicals they recorded were: 

This document published by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) appears to be the source of the 2015 murder numbers in the image. It gives names, pictures and details of 21 trans people murdered in 2015. They do not give details on how they found or verified these names. On page 27 it discusses how the FBI's data collection methods undercount anti-trans violence. The FBI tables for 2015 list 1 trans person murdered. The HRC report says of the FBI's numbers. 

Speculation: The highest accuracy prediction, 91% accuracy, was achieved with 5 photos of the same person. However, there were only 219 gay men and 223 lesbians with 5 photos in their data set, compared to ~3500 each for 1 photo. This could be a weakness in their methods, but 200 subjects is still quite a few. It is possible that their methods overstate their accuracy. The predictions based on 4 photos had significantly more subjects and only slightly lower accuracy. If I arbitrarily decided to throw out the multiple photo accuracy, we are still left with an 81% accuracy for gay men. 

They report that they are going to use better scientific methods to look for more evidence, but the dangers of fires are holding them back. 

Examination of the claims in this question In order to answer this question, read the paper in question and skimmed some of the scientific literature referenced by this paper. 

To restate your question, How can we statistically describe the intervals between mega-volcano eruptions? Do they follow a particular probability distribution with known parameters? Can we use this to make any conclusions at all about Yellowstone? 

This appears to be somewhat true. Death rates increase when you lose your job, but 40,000 people per year is an order of magnitude higher than my estimate. This Quora question answers an identical question and concludes that a 1% increase in unemployment results in about 1,500 excess deaths per year in America. My answer follows the same logic as the Quora answer. I have checked his sources, but I am forced to find my own data for mortality rates because his link is broken. There are roughly 162 million workers in the US, therefore a 1% increase in unemployment corresponds to 1.62 million workers losing their jobs. According to this CDC data, for every 100,000 people aged 25-64 roughly 400 of them will die in a given year. That number comes from averaging the mortality rates for the age groups I assume make up most of the labor force. Therefore, for a given sample of 1.62 million working age people, we expect 6400 of them to die in a given year. This meta-analysis indicates that your risk of death increases by 63% when you lose your job. This means that 10,000 people will die instead of 6400, an increase of 4000 Americans per year. In order for this claim to be true, the increased death rate would have to be 630% instead of 63%. The Quora answerer looked at mostly the same data I did, and his answer is of the same order of magnitude as mine. We both make some simplifying assumptions to get to an answer, and I believe his numbers about as much as mine. Take both with a grain of salt. As a further warning to take this logic with a grain of salt, the meta analysis has a pretty detailed discussion of confounding factors. 

So yes, that lovely smell you smell in your new car is a bunch of chemicals you really don't want to be smelling. And, if you live where it's warm - you'll smell more of them. 

Without getting into the blatant commercialism on the site, I'll concentrate on the 'detoxification' recommendation of: Coffee Enemas. These are most often touted as being either detoxifying (as in the Gerson Therapy), a preventative for cancer or a treatment for cancer. There is no evidence that coffee enemas are beneficial. Ernst, E. M.D., Ph.d., F.R.C.P. (Edin). Colonic Irrigation and the Theory of Autointoxication: A Triumph of Ignorance over Science. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology. 24(4):196-198, June 1997.

I have to go pick up my son from daycare, but I'll discuss the ozone portion shortly. ...shortly is about a week later! Sorry guys! Life intruded. Nothing on the Gerson page specifically mentions ozone therapy, at least not that I've seen. Anyone suggesting you inhale ozone is, quite simply, an idiot. They're also putting your health at risk. Ozone is a pollutant in the atmosphere. (It's vital in the stratosphere, but tropospheric and atmospheric O3 is a pollutant and detrimental to human health.) Ozone exposure has been long known to exacerbate asthma. See McConnell, et al Asthma in exercising children exposed to ozone: a cohort study Ozone in your indoor air will also react with any VVOC, VOC or SVOC - very volatile organic compound (formaldehyde, methanol, methane), volatile organic compound (benzene, limonene), or semi volatile organic compound (PAHs) - the same as it does when it creates photochemical smog outdoors.
