To understand why some countries are rich and others are not, we need to understand what happened to each of them in the past. How and why they developed depends to a large extent on events that took place decades or even centuries ago. This is what economists broadly refer to as path dependence. Brian Arthur was probably one of the first economists to point that out in the late 1980's. Recently this type of arguing was appreciated again by mainstream economics. There is a growing number of scholarly articles that show how and why some countries developed the way they did. With huge implication for future economic development. Two good summaries are Nunn - The Importance of Economic History for Economic Development and Nunn - Historical Development. So the conclusion would somewhat be like that one can't ignore history if she wants to understand why some countries are poor. And more generally why some things are the way they are (one prominent example was the somewhat random event of why we have a QWERTY keyboard system that is a lot slower than other potential alignments of letters on a keyboard. It was determined once by "luck" let's say, and we never switched back...) So all in all I would argue that knowing (and potentially understanding) some history is essential to understanding how our world works. It's certainly nothing that you can sell as a key feature in your CV (like a specific programming skill), but knowing sufficient history would certainly alter anyone's view of the world. And in order to not repeat huge mistakes that were made in the past (as a "society"), we actually need to know what they were and how and why they came about. 

If thera are two firms and both of them have constant returns to scale production function. Will the aggregate/industry production function still be the sum of individual production functions. How does CRS effect the aggregate production function of industry? 

No they are not same. Production Possibility Frontier is the maximum amount of output that can be produced using different combination of inputs. However this opportunity frontier is the tradeoff between different outputs that a firm can produce. In order to increase production of one output it has to decrease production of another. 

I'm trying to build a structural model explaining the job search process by the job-seeker. One of the crucial component of job search, that i want to model, is the expectation about the employer. So things like a worker will not apply for job to the employer if he thinks/believe (correctly or incorrectly) that employer is racist, or if we thinks/believe that this job won't pay him well. I want to model these expectations and don't know where to start. I will really appreciate if someone can help highlight few references in this regard and offer any useful suggestion that can help me build the structural model and eventually estimate parameters of interest. 

Thanks for the hint and the link! I think I now managed to find the solution. Putting the exponent on the LHS and replacing $C_t^{1-\gamma}$ with $C+(1-\gamma) C^{1-\gamma}C \tilde{c}$ and $C_t(i)^{1-\gamma}$ with $C(i)+(1-\gamma)C(i)^{1-\gamma}\tilde{c}_t(i)$ i get (subtracting Steady State values): $(1-\gamma) C^{1-\gamma}C \tilde{c}=\int_0^1 (1-\gamma)C(i)^{1-\gamma}\tilde{c}_t(i) \ di$ Assuming steady state values of $C(i)$ are constant across $i$, i can take all values out of the integral and simplify to get: $\tilde{c}=\int_0^1 \tilde{c}_t(i) \ di$ 

The third line of p.45 denotes: $MC_{t+k|t}=\psi_{t+k|t}/P_{t+k}$ but this is probably not the answer you are looking for. Going from eq. (9) to (10), multipliy the right-hand side by $\frac{P_{t+k}}{P_{t+k}}=1$ (you can always multiply by one), the numerator goes into $\Pi_{t-1,t+k}$ (together with $P_{t-1}$), the denominator goes into $MC_{t+k|t}=\psi_{t+k|t}/P_{t+k}$. 

We know that (in this model) the price of patties influences the demand of buns. This is because a cheaper patty makes the whole burger cheaper, which makes me demand more burger and therefore more bun . 

I need to model the job application process by job seekers. Specifically a job seeker when looking for a job, comes across a job and then decides whether to apply for it or not. I want to model this application decision. Assuming that job seeker has already come across a job, I want to model what are the factors (of the job/employer) that will make this person apply or not apply to the job. I will appreciate any references that have done similar modeling or any suggestions in this direction. I have been reading papers from job search theory but I can't figure how to use search theory to build my model. The search literature seem to argue that only factor that may affect person's decision to apply is the wage offer from current job versus an outside option. However, in the absence of wage offer; for example person looking at job description and thinking whether he should apply to this job or not, is the question that I'm really after. I guess this is still a search question, it's just that I want to model for other factors (expectation about wages, job condition, employer, my own taste towards the job/employer etc) in the application decision. Appreciate any help! 

This is a very patchy answer due to the patchy nature of the question. To me it seems that it is being tried to link behavioural economics to the million dollar question of why some countries are rich and others not. First of all let's put forward what behavioural economics actually tries to do: it aims to explain divergences of economic decision making from what standard neo-classical theory would predict. Now to the part of why some countries "lead" and others don't: we still don't know nearly everything concerning that question, but usually two major factors are being put forward: culture & institutions (and very recently there is a strand of literature that tries to make the point that (random) historical events had quite an impact as well - this would correspond to the "luck" point in e.g. Acemoglu's textbook). There is still a debate ongoing whether it was culture or institutions between people like Acemoglu, Rodrik, Sachs, Shleifer... Recently there was one between Joel Mokyr and Deirdre McCloskey on institutions which later was published in the Journal of Institutional Economics. The only thing where behaviour could potentially play in is the culture part. This term is not well-defineable of course, but loosely speaking we mean everything which relates to social- and societal-norms. One important of this cultural component is trust. Trust in government but most importantly mutual trust. The powerful implication for development would be that if people do not trust each other (nor the government), sound businessmaking is rather impossible. When people don't trust each other they don't engage in all kinds of things that usually tend increase a countrys productivity etc... These parameters have been tried to measure through individual surveys like the World Value Survey (WVS). Economists then found empirical evidence later on for the things I described above. Which brings me to the last part: "Theories or analysis?". I think you rather meant to say theory or empirics. Usually those questions are tackled through empirical investigations. 

Let $z_a$ and $z_b$ are two vectors of inputs. $z_a$ is variable in both long run and short run however $z_b$ is only variable in long run. Now let's suppose that the price of one of the inputs in vector $z_a$ increases (let's say $z_a^i$), how would that effect the marginal cost in the long and short run? Can we compare the long run and short run marginal cost because of this price change? I understand the relationship of long run and short run costs and marginal costs, however I am finding a hard time understanding these price change effects. Any help is appreciated. 

The classic reference on this topic (as suggested by my professor) is the book; Theory of Cost and Production Functions by Ronald Shepherd. 

Second derivative of cost function is actually the first derivative of marginal cost function. i.e. $$ \frac{\partial^2C(q)}{\partial q^2} =\frac{\partial}{\partial q}\frac{\partial C(q)}{\partial q}=\frac{\partial}{\partial q}MC(q) $$ Now if $\frac{\partial^2C(q)}{\partial q^2}<0$, this means that marginal cost is decreasing in output. If marginal cost is decreasing then that implies that firm's average cost is decreasing and hence it exhibits increasing returns to scale. 

ad 2. This phenomenon has been studied a lot. Broadly it is referred to as the demographic transition. A good overview is given by the respective Wikipedia article. In the field of Long-term macro there are several publications. One of the latest top-journal publications is: Cervellati M.; Sunde U., Life Expectancy and Economic Growth: The Role of The Demographic Transition, «JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH», 2011, 16(2), pp. 99 - 133. Demographic elements can for sure be endogenised into every macro model. But I doubt that it would be very useful for short run DSGE things, since all demographic changes take place with huge time lags. If you want to study those interesting phenomena, you probably have to go more into Long-run Macro / Economic Growth (Unified Growth Theories put emphasis on demographic elements for instance) 

USD 2.5m, I would agree with that conditionally. 2m worth of final goods were produced. The workers did not spend the 500k they saved. BUT: you wrote that the suppliers spent the money to produce the car. Depending on the interpretation of the question, the GDP can be different. Since it says explicitly "to produce the cars", those 500k would be intermediate goods that do not enter. There was no consumption. Thus my final answer would be USD 2m (only the cars)! 

That depends on your model of the world, and on how you define "goods and services". In a gold standard world, you essentially exchange goods and services with gold. Gold mining is therefore simply an expansion of the money supply. Adding gold to both the nominal and real side of the economy seems to me like today adding money as a good to GDP. If you do this, you get a positive trade balance. It makes a lot of sense to seperate monetary gold, which is on the monetary side, and commodity gold, on the goods side, as Henry mentioned in the comments. In my opinion, it does not make sense to count gold twice. It seems reasonable to seperate the monetary and real side of the world, which then would yield a balanced world trade. To the second question: I am no expert on gold mining, but I could imagine that it is not possible to "drive up" gold production in a recession. What is true is that a (nearly) constant money/gold supply leads to inflation being counter cyclical.
