Addition, based on a comment: A good point was brought up in a comment regarding why the nation that controls this airship would be willing to negotiate limits on its use. The fact that it is the only one who controls such an airship is the only reason it needs to limit its use: it wants to maintain its advantage. By limiting the spread of the weaponizeable technology, it maintains a monopoly on such technology. It would be similar to if the US managed to negotiate the cessation of weapons tests in the 5 years between the first successful US test and the first successful USSR test. Although it would be very limited, the US would still have a powerful arsenal and a head start on any attempts to break the treaty, giving them a large advantage. As for the non-superwepon nations incentive to limit the advancement of such weapons: 180+ real nations have agreed to not pursue nuclear weapons. Clearly, most nations seem to agree that limited superweapons is safer for them than prevalent superweapons. 

This world could be filled with fractal critters. They can be as large or as small as you want, as they just have infinite detail: the closer you get to the critter, to more of it you can see. Perhaps Menger sponges inhabit the oceans? They can be made into some cool carpets. Or perhaps mollusks with Apollonian gasket shells? An Ikeda map jellyfish? Mandelbrot manta rays? I know you only asked for critters, but why stop there? An infinite world could also have fields of Mandelbulb flowers, crops of true Romanesco broccoli, Dragon island chains, caves with Sierpinski stalagmites, Pythagoras trees, and storms of Lichtenberg lightening and Koch snowflakes. The options are, by defnition, endless! 

My best guess is the solar system has enough solid mass for 45-95 Earths, all but two of which are from the gas giants. They can get closer to 500-600 if they can convert hydrogen and helium into material the Earth is made out of. More than 300,000 if they can convert the entire Sun. However, it's unlikely you'd get more than a few to actually have biospheres if you can't convert elements to other elements, since large amounts of iron would be needed in the core of each planet to produce a magnetic field to protect the planet. Let's start with the rocky planets, since it's easy to estimate material from them. For the record, you are overestimating the size of Mars. According to the Wikipedia list objects in the solar system by mass, Mercury gets you 0.06 Earths, Venus 0.82, Earth 1(unsurprisingly), Mars 0.11, and scraping together all of the moons and dwarf planets gets another 0.10 if you round up generously, for a total of 2.09 Earths worth of mass. Let's round down to 2 Earths(or round up to 3, this mass is irrelevant anyway). The gas giants are where the real planetary mass is: Jupiter alone would be more than 300 Earths worth of mass. However, unless your advanced civilization can convert the hydrogen, helium, and other gases that make up most of these gas giants mass into rocks your Earth collection will be a bit soft. So, we'll look at estimates for the solid material in these. Wikipedia provides estimates of 12-45 Earths worth of solid mass in Jupiter, 9-22 for Saturn, 9-14 for Uranus, and 10-15 for Neptune. This totals up to 40-96 Earth-masses worth of solid material in the planets. If they can convert all of the gasses in those gas giants into the material the earth is made out of(32% iron, 30% oxygen,15% silicon, 14% magnesium, 10% assorted), then you could easily get a few hundred Earths. However, all of this is irrelevant if they can convert gaseous elements into rocks: the sun alone would get you more than 300,000 Earths worth of mass. 

No, they would not counteract eachother's tidal pull because the pull of gravity does not increase linearly with distance. The planet would still have two tides, as water will be attracted to each moon. The formula for determining gravitational force between two objects includes the gravitational constant, the masses of the two objects, and the square of the distance between the two objects. Because of the formula's inverse proportionality, water on one side of the planet will feel a significantly smaller attraction to a given moon than water on the other side of the planet. So, if Moon A was on one side of a planet and Moon B was on the opposite side, water on Moon A's side would feel a stronger force towards Moon A than Moon B, leading to a tide on Moon A's side. Similarly, Moon B's side would have its own identical tide, as water on Moon B's side would be more attracted to Moon B than to Moon A. 

They live for 10,000 years, they're a post-scarcity society, have infinite energy, and haven't invented anything new in so long that they barely remember that new things can be invented. That's their problem: they don't know how to invent, how to adapt. It's been millennia since they've faced any real danger or crisis. However, they still know that things can go wrong, and they can't predict when such a thing will happen. So, they go around to 'primitive' worlds, testing them to find successful ways to react to a crisis. They cause one of several potential catastrophes on worlds and record how the inhabitants try to survive, in case they need to do the same. What is a good strategy for an energy crisis? What is a good strategy if we're invaded by an advanced race? And, for the Earth experiment: What is a good survival strategy if we have an incredibly destructive war with ourselves? 

In summary: The bacteria's sulfuric acid and yeast's ethanol would definitely be an annoying, if not very lethal, poison when separate. When combined, they will produce a short-range burst of flame(if ignited somehow). When combined with the palmitic/naphthenic, it will shoot out as a sticky stream(or glob, your choice) of flame than will burn until it is out of fuel. 

Water: A desert is really just a lake with the lake bed on top. A desert still has underground aquifers along the water table, just like any non-desert areas. The only reason a desert is dry is because it doesn't rain, meaning that the water table is lower and the area above the water table is rarely saturated with water. So, to get water all the cities need to do is settle in an area where the water table is relatively close to the surface, such as near an oasis or river, and/or dig a lot of wells deep enough to reach the water table. Electricity: Also surprisingly easy in a desert. If these cities are advanced enough, then they can put the scorching sun to good use with solar panels. Since there are no pesky trees in the way, wind is also plentiful in deserts. Windmills have been used since at least the ancient Greeks to perform work, and could be a reliable source of electricity. If the cities happen to be near a large, Nile-like river, hydroelectric dams could be yet another option. And, as always, there's oil. 

However, the other requirement you seem to have is that it needs to produce a napalm-like gel substance in order to stick the flames to the target. You say 'napalm-like gel', but why not actual napalm gel? Napalm gets its name from the two chemicals used to make the gelling agent: Naphthenic acid and palmitic acid. Palmitic acid is the easy one to explain, as it is already the most common type of fatty acid found in animals. To get large enough amounts, just have the dragon's diet be rich in oil palms for some reason. Some biological mechanism and have it store the large amounts of palmitic acid in yet another sac. Naphthenic acid is a bit trickier, as it is mainly produced during crude oil refining, and crude oil is generally found deep underground. However, your dragon has hope: the Athabasca oil sands are a source of naphta-rich crude oil that is close to the surface. It's not unreasonable to think that the dragons hang out near exposed pockets of oil sands, using chunks of it as gizzard stones to help digest food. Some bilogical mechanism would separate out the naphta, give it some oxygen, and store the resultant naphthenic acids in their palm oil sacs to create the gel. 

It seems like warfare strategy in this setup would result in a couple options, depending on how far the ships can travel outside an island: "Trench" Warfare: As you said, the attacker is at a serious disadvantage since the distance between islands is so large, and all of the 'front' islands seem well defended. Because of this, warfare may result in WW1-style trench warfare: one side launches a massive attack with massive casualties, sometimes even taking full control of an island, but then they always need to pull back to either defend against the other side's massive attack or because their numbers are too few to defend the captured island. Island Hopping: Moving from WW1 to WW2, Pacific-war style island hopping can be a viable strategy if ships can travel past the 'front' islands. Does the enemy have a heavily defended island but weakly defended islands behind it? The attacker can focus on taking the islands 'around' the defenders to cutoff supply and communication lines, forcing the defenders to either pull some ships back to protect these islands or allow the front defenses to weaken due to lack of supplies. Granted, this requires some supplies to be impossible to make on the front islands, like ship fuel or other materiel. Guerilla Warfare: Moving from WW2 to more recent conflicts, asymmetric warfare may be a good option, again depending on if ships can travel past the front islands. Small scale hit-and-run attacks on supply lines, terrorist attacks on civilian targets, sabotage on factories, propaganda efforts to demoralize the enemy and cause unrest/revolts, all of which can be done when leaving the bulk of your force defending your front and can completely bypass the enemy front. However, this also means that counter-espionage and counter-terrorist efforts on your islands need to be as large or larger than your own attacks. Overall, a mix of these tactics will probably be used as each side tries to gain an advantage and exploit the enemy's weaknesses. What each side focuses on really depends on what you want to focus on. 

In short, if this hypothetical civilization had their own Gutenberg and a trade-based production economy, it's reasonable to think they would have an early industrial revolution. It would still take centuries to reach a modern-level of technology, but that would certainly be quick compare to real-life innovation. 

There are really two options for what this would be like, depending on whether physics has mostly been thrown out the window or not: Pretty much ignoring all the non-fun physics: According to this Skeptics StackExchange, the earth is as smooth as pretty fine sandpaper, so it would 'feel' like holding a rough, mostly wet ball of rock. Since you're more massive than the Earth, and thus have more gravity, the atmosphere and all the water would quickly leave the Earth and slosh around on the surface of your hands. Obviously, this would be bad for the Earth because people like having air and water. Earth is moving fast around the sun, but if you're already moving fast enough to hold it, then you could definitely throw it since the only thing keeping it around the sun is gravity which you shouldn't have a problem overcoming. More realistic answer: Assuming that you somehow handwaved physics on yourself in order to be this large, but not anything else, then really a few things could happen: -If you are much more massive than the Earth, i.e. have more mass and thus more gravitational pull, the Earth would be ripped apart by you just being near it. The chunks of (mostly)molten rock and iron would then fall towards your stomach(center of mass) where it would collect in a slowly pooling pile that slowly spreads out around the middle of your body. Obviously, this would be bad for anyone on the Earth. -If the Earth is much more massive than you, i.e. you're big but very light, then you would be pulled apart by the Earth, again due to the effects of passing the Roche limit. Now your molten chunks get to fall towards the center of Earth's mass! Again, pretty bad for anyone on the Earth(which technically includes you now). -If you and the Earth are similarly massive, then you would both be deformed and pulled apart as you fall towards eachother's center of mass. Again, not the best situation for life on Earth.
