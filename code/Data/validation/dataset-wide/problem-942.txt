The term "slash and burn" is generally not used to describe the field burning that is currently done in North America. Burning fields is illegal in some states. It is allowed in other states, but is usually regulated under a Smoke Management Plan. Smoke exposure is a serious health concern and particulate matter pollution is regulated under the Clean Air Act in the USA. Many states only allow field burning at certaim times, based on atmospheric ventilation and current fire potential on the natural landscape. 

Expect every daily retrieval of AOD to have many missing pixels, mostly where clouds appear. Data is removed when the quality assurance flags do not meet some minimum criteria. This can happen when the retrieval is contaminated (e.g. from clouds or sun glint on the surface). If you are interested, you can obtain raw level-1 and level-2 data with all data, including arrays for quality assurance flags. There will also be systematic gaps in the data where the satellite had no coverage. Polar orbiting satellites will get complete coverage near the poles, but widening gaps will appear the closer you get to the equator. 

Air quality modeling helps to fill in the gaps left by monitoring networks, since they are expensive to site and maintain. Monitor networks are relatively sparse compared to the number of major source and receptor locations. So, it is important to carefully consider each site location and pick ones that satisfy multiple criteria. Satellite retrievals and local testimonials can be used to evaluate the initial value of your network. However, you will benefit from quality controlling your model in the areas where your model performs poorly. For reference, here is an example of how modeling and air monitors can be used together to make quality forecasts. Environment and Climate Change Canada’s FireWork air quality (AQ) forecast system for North America with wildfire emissions has a post process called UMOS-AQ (see below). The Canadian researchers built a system that modifies their air quality predictions based on recent surface monitor model/observations comparisons. The Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS)uses GEM-MACH (Global Environmental Multi-scale - Modelling Air quality and CHemistry) and BlueSky Canada. Here is a paper that describes the process. 

What is the significance of the "super historic" rainfall for July in California (July 19, 2015) in terms of climate change and water reservoirs used for municipalities? In other words, what is the likelihood that climate change could bring more of these types of rain events in the future? Related, what is the relative impact on water reservoirs and how much relief from the drought does such an event provide? Does California have a long-term plan to capture more of this type of flash-flood rainfall in the future? 

First of all, the Earth does not receive heat from the Sun, it receives visible light that is absorbed by the surface of the Earth and then heat is re-radiated back into the atmosphere. If the surface is ice/snow, most of the light from the sun is reflected back to space. Sunlight will sublimate a little bit of the ice, but it is normally replenished at a faster rate than it is lost. Ice endures through the summer in Antarctica, even as the air warms up. This is in contrast to the ice at the Arctic pole that completely melts every summer. This is for 2 reasons: 

When reading about methane and its effect on climate, it is clear that its lifetime in the atmosphere is important to the global warming potential. However, the lifetime does vary from 9 to 15 years, depending on conditions. What are those conditions that would affect the lifetime of methane? How does the lifetime of methane vary in the atmosphere? 

This question might be better suited for GIS stack exchange... but I'll take a shot: dx and dy are the distance per grid cell in the projected grid units, which is part of your grid definition. ref_lat and ref_lon are part of your projection definition. i_parent_start and j_parent_start are the horizontal grid cell numbers of the parent grid, where your nested grid sits. I believe WRF grids are oriented so that i,j of 0,0 are the bottom left of your grid (e.g. a typical x-y cartesian coordinate system) and the first pixel position is defined to be at the 1,1 coordinate. In order to create a shapefile of the grid projection, I would personally use the Spatial Allocator Tool from UNC ($URL$ I believe the same tool will map points to your grid as well. However, if you want to map things to check the results, you could use your projection definition to build a custom transformation in a GIS program, project your lat/longs, and then map everything together. 

Scientists can measure the chemical composition of the atmosphere of other planets using spectroscopy. Each molecule in the atmosphere absorbs and re-radiates at specific frequencies of light that are a function of temperature and unique to the specific type of molecule. For more information see $URL$ and $URL$ . 

I highly suggest you read this page here: $URL$ and here:$URL$ which explains global footprint quite nicely and puts it into perspective. 

So, you need to divide all those numbers by 10 to get the actual values. Also, take note in the readme file of these pieces that correspond to the data file in question: 

The answers posted thus far have correctly pointed out that natural life would cease to exist without photosynthesis provided by the sun, and natural heat sources from the Earth would only be enough to sustain some very simple lifeforms, and even that is a big maybe. However, there is one other possibility that I have not seen mentioned, which is the influence of man-made technology. Technically life could survive on Earth in an artificial environment if there were (for instance) man-made power generators that warmed areas (probably underground for insulation). Clearly all life would be dependent on technological processes that would fail at some point and the likelihood of having replacement parts and mechanics is slim at best. But, the advancements in automated artificial intelligence could one day take this concept much further. Furthermore, if there were an external source of energy that could be used (e.g. if we had much more skill with space travel), that energy could be transported to Earth and used in some way to allow life to exist in a highly controlled artificial environment. 

Gerrit is correct, the climatological setting indicates that the value is filled in (not an actual retrieval). If you see the MODIS Vegetation Index User’s Guide, it is discussed a few times: 

I was reading this article about Zealandia and got excited that there could be an underwater continent. However, when viewing the image (below) it appears that Zealandia is much smaller than any other continent. The article says the bases considered were: 

Unlike the arctic, the ice in Antarctica is on a continental shelf, so there is no water beneath it to help melt the ice. Antarctica is the highest continent on Earth, with an average elevation of 8,200ft. At that elevation and within the polar region, ice can persist indefinitely because the average atmospheric temperature is very cold. At high elevations, there is little atmosphere to trap any heat radiated by the Earth, which is why the air is so cold at high elevations. 

HIRS is an old NASA heritage design that flew on both European and US weather satellites as part of the EUMETSAT/NOAA Initial Joint Polar System. The Inrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) will take over the duties of HIRS, since IASI is a more powerful instrument with European design for a European satellite. You can see this discussed here: $URL$ My perspective on this is that historically the US was the international leader in environmental satellites. The Europeans now have better designs and more committed plans to environmental satellites over the next couple decades. So, essentially, they don't need our out-dated hardware anymore. 

grow massive tree farms; increase algae production and forest cover. stop emission sources cover disturbed and urban surfaces (and rooftops) in reflective color/material cloud-seeding (which can also increase snow-cover) Injecting aerosols/particles into the stratosphere to mimic a major volcanic event 

Crustal elements are essentially from soil which have undergone compaction during geologic processes. Particles are then lifted into the air (e.g. by wind) and coarse particles from the soil are suspended in the atmosphere. If the particulate is from wildfire, it is still of "natural origin", but the particulate is from a combustion source. Combustion creates fine particles. Anthropogenic particulate emissions are dominated by combustion sources, because so much of our industry and energy production uses combustible fuels. Combustion creates fine particles. However, there are still several anthropogenic sources that create coarse particulate (e.g. road dust, construction dust, agricultural processes, etc.). 

It is generally assumed that clouds affect climate by reflecting sunlight back to space and therefore decreasing the total warming of the Earth. However, stratospheric ice clouds are said to have a net warming effect, due to (I think) the insulation properties of clouds and the low reflectivity of ice clouds. How do various clouds affect climate? Specifically, what is the relative energy balance effect clouds have as you go up in the atmosphere? Is it just stratospheric ice clouds that have a net warming effect? What really are the insulation properties of a cloud and how do they compare to the reflectivity? 

You might find this article by Licudine et al., (2012) of interest, which discusses monitoring of metals on New Years in Hawaii. 

It seems that you are concerned that your values in the data go above the max value on the color bar shown in the kml file. I wouldn't worry about that. You are using the "level 3" monthly average product, which by definition is highly quality controlled. For most of the globe, typical values will vary between 1 x 10^14 and 5 x 10^15 molec/cm2. Values over 20 x 10^15 molec/cm2 only occur in highly polluted areas. Very large values in the OMI NO2 product are realistic, especially in SE Asia, where the largest NO2 columns are obtained. I have even seen values over 1 x 10^17 on occasion. As the signal gets larger, there is actually more confidence in the retrieval. Really it's the low values (e.g. less than 8 x 10^14 molec/cm2) that you should treat cautiously, as anything lower than that could be "noise". In order to show the variance of values (which can span 4 orders of magnitude) across the whole globe, the color scale chosen works well. Note that the color bar is a logarithmic scale, which helps give definition to the plots in the regions with typical values. You could rewrite the kml file though, and pick a different max value, if you are interested in better plots of southeast Asia. If you are interested in learning more about the product, I highly suggest you see Boersma (2011) and also refer to the user manual. 

How much forested land is currently protected from logging/deforestation? How much is currently at risk? How do tree plantations compare in overall size? I'm hoping someone could answer these questions in terms of the main countries involved. Here is what I have found thus far: From $URL$ 

Yes there is value. 1)Often times we use models to check our own understanding of a process. If the model is built with all known factors included, it might still fail to produce results that can be verified with measurements. When the model is unable to reproduce a phenomenon, the test case can be used to assess what parts of the model need further development. 2)Sometimes systems are too complicated to model accurately (or perhaps there are too many unknowns in the initial or boundary conditions). Although the model might fail to reproduce absolute values that are measured, it might still be able to produce realistic dynamic variance. So, the model is still useful for studying the relationships between the dynamic processes that are involved. This is sometimes how we find secondary effects that are not typically direct outcomes of the model processes. 

Fundamentally your reasoning is flawed because the major composition of the atmosphere is nitrogen and oxygen. "Pumping a few parts-per-million" of some other gas into the atmosphere won't do anything to the relative contribution of GHGs to global warming. GHG's contributions will still be felt the same, regardless of the presence of any other gas. The "anti-greenhouse gas" that you refer does not exist. All gases scatter and absorb different wavelengths of light in unique ways, and this all varies by temperature. However, no gas destroys light energy. A realistic answer is to increase clouds and aerosols, which will reflect more energy back to space before it can be absorbed by the Earth's surface. Humans now account for the majority of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. Regardless if we shut off all our GHG emissions, our climate will still be warm for at least the next century. Realistic solutions to reduce climate warming include: 

Is there some criteria on size that should be met to be classified as a continent? If so, does Zealandia meet that criteria? Or, is it possible that Zealandia is a continental fragment? 

If we consider GHGs on a global level (see Global Carbon Project $URL$ ) we can see how each sector has impacted the atmospheric concentration of CO2 over the past 143 yrs. 

The estimate of 0.6 meters has increased as recent research shows Greenland's melt rate is a bit faster than previously estimated and ocean warming, which causes expansion, is also happening more rapidly. Below is some useful information from the 2014 US National Climate Assessment ( $URL$ ). 

The discussion paper, which is still undergoing peer-review at the time of this post, brings into question the semi-empirical methods used to calculate the rate of sea-level rise on the decade-scale. As an alternative, they use paleo-climate data and doubling times to make their own approximation, which predicts faster sea level rise. Let us be clear, though, the amount of possible net sea level rise over the next few hundred years or so is not really in question. The timing of how fast the sea will rise over the coming century is what is less certain. So, a coastal community doing long term planning could consider sea-level rise even further in the future. Most of Greenland could melt over the next few hundred years, which would contribute nearly 6 meters of sea level rise. If we are strictly talking about the year 2100, though, that is a difficult forecast to make. For planning purposes, it would be wise to assume at least 1 meter of sea level rise by 2100, with definite continued increases. 

Unlike storms and floods, lightning strikes a single point. So the area directly affected by lightning is small in comparison. Another thing to consider is that when you see lightning, that does not mean it touched down to the ground. However, keep in mind the fundamental way that lightning causes destruction, death, property damage, etc: wildfires. Most wildfires are caused by lightning. In the USA alone, over 10,000 lightning-caused wildfires are reported each year. And, nearly 4 million acres are burned by those fires. See the NIFC for more information. So, while it is unlikely to get struck directly by lightning, the fires that are caused by lightning cause many deaths and vast amounts of property damage, which dwarfs the damage caused by floods and storms. 

The context I often see the u,v,w components shown in one plot are forward and backward trajectory plots like those from the NOAA HYSPLIT Model, which provides separate panels for horizontal and vertical movement. There is also 3-D imagery like what's available from UCAR in the cross sections examples for WRF, shown below. 

There was a story on slashdot today $URL$ that discussed a case for teaching ignorance (or rather, what we don't know) to science students. We spend countless hours learning facts about our specific scientific discipline. However, we rarely take the time to learn what is unknown in our field. It says: 

All mass used in construction on Earth comes from material on Earth. Since mass is conserved, there is no change. If we start harvesting material from the moon or asteroids for use in construction on Earth, then there would be a net increase in mass. But currently, the net mass of Earth has decreased due to man, since we have launched many satellites into space which came from material on Earth. 

Ozone is most closely correlated to temperature. Yes you need NOx and VOCs to create ozone, but you also need enough photolysis driven by sunlight in order for ozone to form. The day analyzed in the question is during the middle of winter, which generally does not have enough sunlight to allow ozone to build up in the atmosphere. Furthermore, when there are high NOx concentrations (and no sunlight), ozone will titrate out of the atmosphere. In contrast, PM2.5 generally reaches it's highest concentrations during the winter (or at night) when the mixing layer is shallow due to cold conditions, which traps particles close to the surface. There are exceptions to these rules though they are rare. The exception for ozone is when you have very large VOC concentrations (e.g. near an oil field) over a snow layer, because sunlight reflects off the surface and can lead to twice the photolysis. The exception for PM2.5 is when there are very large sources (e.g. a wildfire) and you get directly within the path of the plume.
