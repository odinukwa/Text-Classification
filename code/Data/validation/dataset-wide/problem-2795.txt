I do appreciate the attempts to detail the differences in the other questions; and I do think that a lot of good points are covered. But I believe the answer to your question is fairly straightforward: The simple fact of the matter is that Q1 and Q2 are addressing different types of subject matter (this is assuming that by 'created' you mean 'created' in the same sense that is usually intended when asking 'was the Universe created'). Q1 is an empirical question. You mention that—being a statement about all bodies—there is no way to fully test whether the law holds. This is true, but it is also a non-sequitur. Physical Science is concerned with finding a model of the Universe that most closely aligns with experimental, empirical, data; no general law will be fully testable. The point is that over time, a massive number of observations are taken, and over time the model is changed as theories are found that more accurately allow for both modeling of past events, and prediction of future ones. Q2 is a metaphysical question. Is there something outside the Universe that created it? (If the question is a physical one, e.g. is there something inside the Universe that created everything within, then the answer is: current experimental data gives no reason to suggest such a thing.) As a metaphysical question, it is inherently non-scientific, as physical science is concerned with things that are within the Universe, rather than things outside and/or prior to it. If you have particular hypothesis about some physical condition that would hold as a result of "everything was created" being true, then you would have two things to deal with: the reasoning leading you from the statement to the hypothesis, which would be non-scientific; and the hypothesis itself, which could be tested against existing physical models to evaluate it. Note that the question of whether any particular hypothesis proves that the overall statement is still outside of science, as science is not geared towards making such determinations. [edited: 2014-07-07] As the question is more-or-less a summary of (or parellel to, depending on the scope one allows) the belief that 'creation science' is a scientific endeavor, a discussion in the comments led me to the following quote from the Wikipedia article on Creation Science , which I think summarizes things quite incisively: 

Although the argument offers the general fact that people have religious experiences, it ignores the specific fact that many people never have religious experiences. Of those who do have these experiences, many already hold a prior belief in God. The Ludic fallacy? Nassim Taleb coined this term in his book The Black Swan. He defines it as basing studies of chance on the narrow world of games and dice. The gynecologists example: 

Just to highlight that there is more than one approach to knowledge, take a look at the following. I know x if and only if: 

Is it possible to construct an argument which follows the above logical form, but has true premises whilst the conclusion is false? If it is possible, then Modus Ponens becomes an invalid form of argument. If it isn't possible, then Modus Ponens is a valid argument form. Take the following argument: 

This is a broad picture of an approach to knowledge known as reliabilism. It is concerned with the truth-conduciveness of your belief forming method. See $URL$ for further information. 

I can offer a discussion on the issue of embryos and personhood; however, I have not kept track of specific names of the philosophers' works that I have read on this topic. I hope this will provide you with thought-provoking points to consider as you develop your presentation - it is a truly interesting and important topic. To summarize this discussion, by the argument I will lay out (that if it is X at the end, in the absence of a distinct change, then it must be X from the start), there is not a good criteria for terminating another human's life at any developmental stage to use its cells. The term personhood is inadequate, and more objective terminology should be used in order to successfully address these ethical and legal topics. Person / Non-person is a binary distinction. (There's no validity to "half-person" or "3/7ths person.") "Person" has many different interpretations, even referring to adult humans; historically, often the adult males of the ruling class were the only "persons" in a society. The fact that even in the US, women were denied full "personhood" within the last century makes it clear that the term fluctuates based upon current societal attitudes and politics. It also morphs depending on the context in which it is used, and in some cases can even be defined by the desire of another human being. It seems illogical (and unethical) that the definition of a rightful member of our species is allowed to morph depending on swinging attitudes and politics. Scientific objectivity is a key in moving away from these fluctuating definitions. So as definitions have shifted from white adult men being the only "persons" to defining person as a living human being, it's become even more critical to define "living human being." Human / Non-human is also a binary distinction. With binary definitions: If something is X at the end of a time interval, then either it must become X during that interval, or else it must have been X from the start. Therefore, starting with the premise that all adult humans are persons: If a human adult is a person, then either he/she became a person at some moment, or he/she was a person from the start of his/her individual lifetime. Then, becoming X requires a distinct change. An individual living human being's natural development proceeds uninterrupted from zygote through adult senescence, given adequate nutrients and environment. The embryo is just one stage in this life cycle of a living human organism. When you zoom in and look carefully, it is obvious that all development is gradual- physiologically, genetically, biochemically, anatomically - from the formation of the independent, genetically-unique zygote through adult senescence. (Look at the above link and see how slowly we change - and remember that these are a small number of stop-motion frames over 9 months of gradual development in gestation.) There are strong scientific arguments that no single defining moment of change in the life development of an individual organism is significant enough of a change to demarcate a change in status to toggle from "not a human life" to "human life." Nor from "not a person" to "is a person." 

[end edit] As an aside: it seems you think that somehow scientific concepts are ill-defined; they are not: everything is defined rigorously, science does not attempt to find the 'why' of things, just the 'what'. Force is mass times acceleration; acceleration is increase in velocity. Velocity is distance moved per time; and so forth, eventually coming to rest at defined measures that anyone can use (generally with easier to use alternatives, such as a ruler or stopwatch, but at heart defined upon some physical property measured as accurately as possible) thus making anyone that uses the terms able to run tests on any scientific hypothesis without any disagreement as to what force, etc. are. However, this does not hold for 'X was created'. Created is not a well-defined concept, nor is it measurable. Axiomatic definitions are fine, but they must be well-defined to be science. In a purely philosophical discussion, yes, definition of terms may sometimes lead to an infinite regress, and at some point you have to find common ground in your definitions without arguing them. And, although your second question definitely has long been a matter of philosophical discussion, turning it into a scientific discussion most certainly does require definition. (And, really, once you have done that, it's hardly even the same question.) 

With reference to Are we capable of understanding the system in which we live? , I once read an interesting book: . You can find it on Amazon or similar websites, here is the gist of it: 

One way of getting around this sort of paradox is by noting that omnipotence is with reference to acts that are logically possible. I.e. God cannot perform logical absurdities. 

Question: Could you suggest some works which critically explore the idea that belief in God is properly basic? Thanks. 

I would like to know how material logic differs from formal logic. From the little that I'm aware of, it is apparently the case that material logic concerns itself with the truth of the content of an argument, whilst formal logic only concerns itself with the validity of an argument form. Question: I'm under the impression that material logic is very close to the concept of soundness, is material logic an outdated concept? I would appreciate any elucidations. 

Science is a method. The scientific method gives us tools to hypothesize and theorize models to fit what we currently observe about our universe. Science is not an absolute truth; our body of scientific knowledge is a collection of the best models we currently have. Many models are extremely strong, some are works in progress, and some are just starting to develop. We don't yet have models to fit absolutely everything that we observe, and there are also many things that we have not yet observed, could never observe directly, or have not yet even contemplated. We are inside of a complex system, doing our best to make models that explain the system. Physics is the primary tool that we use to explore models for the mechanics of the universe. We use our current theoretical models of the universe and extrapolate backwards in order to hypothesize what came before what we currently observe. The strongest theory I have ever read for the initial inciting force is the necessity for the existence of an "unmoved mover" (also called "prime mover"). It is philosophy that illuminated the unmoved mover. I would recommend reading about it. I will try to find a better link that Wikipedia, but it is a great start. Nothing from astrophysicists that I have read has presented a convincing-enough argument for what comes before the Big Bang. Many refer to a singularity, but the force that initiated the expansion of the universe has not been successfully modeled. This suggests that it is indeed philosophy that so far has been capable of going beyond the current scientific models proposed. (I consider religion as being an aspect of philosophy.) There are various proposed scenarios for the very early universe, most of which differ radically from one another. A discussion of some of them can be found in the Wikipedia entry on the Chronology of the Universe: 

However, what your friend seems to be doing is that he is highlighting a feature of your disposition (your beliefs), and then using this in order to refute your argument. In other words: 

Figures such as Einstein were quite interested in the Philosophy of science. In addition to this, a fair amount of Philosophers were on the side of Scientists in the face of postmodern reinterpretations, during the science wars. So far, this doesn't really suggest a vitriolic relationship between the two fields. My gut (uneducated) feeling is that the bedlam in question is a relatively recent phenomenon. Question: Is the "Science therefore Philosophy is obsolete" attitude, recent, or is there a historical backdrop which can account for said tension? Source for Hawking's claim 

Understating the evidence Philosopher Paul Draper has coined a fallacy known as "The fallacy of understated evidence". Although its intended area of application is the philosophy of religion, I don't see why it can't be applied to other domains. 

Science has limits. We use tools developed inside of a complex system to try to measure and model the system itself. It is likely impossible that we, as component parts of the system, could ever build a cohesive scientific model to accurately define the entire system. Science can only expand by extrapolating from our current models and rulesets. Philosophy is a different type of tool which can explore many things that the scientific method cannot. As such, it is essential. Lastly, philosophy has throughout history originated a good percentage of the concepts that science has explored and tested to construct these models. 

Embryos are a stage in development of human organisms. To phrase the issue concisely: If something is X at the end of a time interval, then either it must become X during that interval, or else it must have been X from the start. Therefore, becoming X requires a distinct change - "person" is a binary distinction. There are no "half-person" or "3/7ths person" as valid options. But physiologically, genetically, biochemically, anatomically - all development is gradual. (Look at the above link and see how slowly we change - and remember that these are a small number of stop-motion frames over 9 months of gradual development in gestation.) After the formation of the zygote, there are strong scientific arguments that no single defining moment of change in the development from zygote through adult senescence is significant enough of a change to demarcate a change in status to toggle from "not a human life" to "human life." Nor from "not a person" to "is a person." (Even birth is a process of several hours to several days, and a journey of almost 2 feet. At what moment is it a human life or a person? Out with cord cut? Without it cut? Only head out? Cervix dilated?) Cognition is also a very gradual development that can vary widely between individuals. Discussions on this have very diverse opinions. I argue that if one cannot define criteria for a toggle point, there cannot be a solid argument for any point. Therefore, if no toggle point can be established, it defaults to the beginning of the line - the first point of formation of that particular human organism. Otherwise we are stuck in vagueness, ambiguity -- but this is a situation where there absolutely must be a definition; lacking a clear definition of "life" or "person" results in dangerous inconsistencies in discussions on policy, bioethics, and legality. 

There's a good entry on SEP about Pre-Socratic Philosophy,where Cosmology is also mentioned. you might want to take a look over there. 

If the premise were true, then the conclusion would be true and the argument would be valid. But what if our premise was actually false? For example, what if X was actually a triangle? If is true, then the conclusion is also false. We would therefore have a false premise which leads to a false conclusion. We would need the premise to be true and the conclusion to be false for the argument to be invalid. But, this can't happen. If X is a triangle, then the conclusion is false. If X is a square, then the conclusion is true. Either way, we are stuck in a situation where the truth of the premise entails the truth of the conclusion. The argument is therefore valid. Let's define two terms, of which only one term is directly relevant to the question at hand: Tautology: something that is true in all possible worlds. Contradiction : something that is false in all possible worlds. So, if we have a conclusion that is false in all possible worlds, the argument would only be valid if we have premises that entail the truth of the conclusion if the premises were true. Here is an example (Modus Ponens): 

These are uncomfortable questions, but that's because the realities of these issues ARE uncomfortable. We try to hide behind the word "person" to shield us from the discomfort, but we can't change reality to fit our comfort levels. This would allow people of different belief systems to converse more logically about issues that absolutely must be discussed, without perpetuating the current cycle of conflict and misinformation. To summarize, by the argument I laid out (that if it is X at the end, if there is no significant switch, then it must be X from the start), there is not a good criteria for terminating another human's life at any developmental stage to use its cells. The term personhood is inadequate, and more objective terminology should be used in these discussions. Something important to also consider is that this issue will soon be outdated. Pluripotent stem cells are being generated from other sources, and it will soon replace the use of embryo tissues.  I hope this helps generate some interesting thought and discussion, and give you some points to research and consider further as you develop your presentation. 

It looks like a version of the classic omnipotence paradox to me. For instance, the paradox of the stone: 

I'm going to start with a short answer. If your conclusion is a contradiction then your argument can only be valid if the truth of the conclusion is entailed by the truth of the premises. Longer answer: An argument is invalid if it takes a form where the premises are true whilst the conclusion is false. Take Modus Ponens as an example: 

A well known definition of knowledge is the Justified True Belief (JTB) account. For me to know x, the following necessary conditions must hold: 

Whilst your friend's ideas about beliefs have some merit, they are actually irrelevant to the argument at hand. Your argument could very well be wrong, but not for the reasons that he has presented. This is because he is attacking your beliefs instead of your argument. For your friend's argument to be successful, he needs to attack the notion of creatine helping soreness, rather than attacking the idea that you hold a belief in the utility of creatine with respect to soreness. Therefore, I would say that he is guilty of ad hominem. Nevertheless, I don't think that hunting fallacies and then accusing something of committing fallacy X is particularly useful. Rather, you should be able to explain where the reasoning has gone wrong, and you don't need to know the name of a fallacy in order to do that. P.S. What should be noted is that the impact of creatine on soreness is an empirical issue. If you guys intend to debate the notion that creatine reduces muscle soreness, you have to bring some empirical support to the table.
