It seems that the rule was made to make competition more fair - it would give opponents a chance to determine the type of spin that was being imparted and also to make the game more fun to watch. 

As the excerpts above show, players were unhappy with the financial arrangements that they had with the NBA. The players wanted a better pension, some control over the "whisper" fines that referees could impose, payment of back salaries to certain players, and to settle other working conditions and payments. 

Basically, cheaters have an advantage over the testers - they pioneer new techniques or develop drugs that are designed to minimize the risk of detection. Further, the cheaters usually operate under a veil of secrecy - they don't want their efforts to be detected. For this reason, blood and urine samples are sometimes stored for years to allow more advanced tests to be run, once more advanced tests are developed. The new drugs or techniques are usually detected in the end, frequently because a member of the inner circle confesses. Authorities may also successfully arrest members of these groups and confiscate material used to circumvent existing tests. However, these aids can provide their users an advantage over other competitors until a valid test is developed. 

So the rule specified in @Will Cole's answer conflicts somewhat with this one. According to this 2009 ESPN article, the league has generally instructed refs not to enforce the rule. 

The 1976 Olympics are probably the closest example available. According to Wikipedia, Denver was originally scheduled to host the 1976 Winter Olympics: 

I came across a windsurfing blog post with a link to an Excel spreadsheet (titled "Ultimate Windsurfing Equipment Size Calculator"), developed by James Douglass. His spreadsheet runs some calculations using several factors: 

@Mansfield's answer agrees what with I know about NHL paychecks - 13 paychecks, paid biweekly during the season. According to this Yahoo Answers post: 

The IOC would select an alternate host site, probably at a site that had hosted recently to ensure that the requisite facilities would be in place. Innsbruck had hosted the 1964 Games, and were thus chosen as the alternate host. 

These types of trades are still relatively rare, but allow for teams with aggressive ownership to acquire assets without giving up any additional talent. Typically, only second round draft picks have been sold/traded for cash. 

What you see in the superscript is the scoring for the 7 point tie-break game - Carreno won the tie-break 7-4 vs Muller. 

Since it appears that FIBA rules seem to be similar to those of the NCAA used in the Olympics, does this change in rule enforcement affect the play of NBA stars in the Olympics and other international competition? 

In this ITTF news release, the ranking system will be revised, effective January 1, 2018. Changes include: 

For pitchers, some analysts view a low BABIP as an indicator that the pitcher has been "lucky," since they believe that pitchers have little control over balls that are hit in play. In this type of analysis, pitchers that have lower BABIP that their historic averages are viewed as being likely to perform worse in the future, as their BABIP should revert to the mean/norms. However, pitchers might have consistently higher/lower BABIP due to their styles (e.g., percentage of ground balls vs flyballs) and the quality of their fielders. Similarly, this metric can be used to measure the "luck" of hitters - a higher than normal BABIP may indicate that a hitter will "cool off" over the course of the season, while a hitter that has a low BABIP will tend "heat up" as the season progresses. As the ESPN article notes, there are several additional factors that impact BABIP - speed of the hitter, quality of contact, and the quality of the defense. As an example, hitters will a good hitting eye may have better quality of contact and have better BABIP rates than their peers. Faster hitters might also be able to beat out throws to first, thus increasing their BABIP. 

For teams with multiple first round draft picks, what are the rules defining which first round draft pick that a team would need to give up if it signs a restricted free agent (RFA) that have the first round tender? An example would be the Cleveland Browns, which have the 4th and 22nd draft picks in the first round of the 2012 draft. One writer, Bill Barnwell, noted: 

From Yonex USA site, the flight pattern of the Yonex Mavis 370 comes close to that of an actual feather shuttlecock: 

The article goes on to note a few other examples that occurred after the draft lottery was put in place - the Spurs being able to draft Tim Duncan was one example. @Dor also notes the 2011-12 Golden State Warriors season - they were able to keep their 7th overall pick by tanking in the second half of the season. The lottery now makes tanking more difficult - a team can't be assured of the top pick, but can maximize its chance of getting the top pick by putting forth less than its best effort. 

Note: The rule specified in the article above applies only to the NFL, which has additional rules governing the coaching interview process. 

In contrast, NFL paycheck distribution is simpler. According to USA Today, player paychecks are distributed weekly during the season: 

For example, if team A has two victories (one with a 8-8 record and another with a 0-16 record), its strength of victory is 0.250. If team B has also two wins (over opponents that are 8-8 and 12-4), then its strength of victory is 0.625. 

This spreadsheet might offer the type of info you're looking for. Mr. Douglass also provides an online version of his spreadsheet. He also provides the following advice to beginners in this "Top 16 Windsurfing Questions Answered" FAQ: 

While coordinators sometime serve as assistant head coaches, quite frequently special teams or position coaches are rewarded with this title/role. Not all teams have the asisstant head coach role. 

There is also a mention of Peter Rasmussen's badminton coaching video, if you don't mind paying to learn from a championship level player. 

Another article suggested that the free safety could also be considered the quarterback of the defense: 

The BABIP calculation/metric can be used for both batters and pitchers. The formula/definition that you mention above is a good indicator of what it measures - the percentage of hits for balls that were hit into play. Per this excerpt from ESPN: 

These links are all subjective, but all seem to indicate that nothing really matches the performance of an actual feather shuttlecock. Durability seems to be the largest advantage of the plastic versions. I hope this info will point you in the right direction for your search - please let us know which brand/model you decide on. 

According to the calculations done in this James Click article titled "Taking One for the Team: When Does it Make Sense to Sacrifice? Part 1", he concludes: 

This guide to defensive schemes provides good background material on this topic, including a list of roles of various defensive positions for each scheme, while this 2011 NY Times article contains a list of 10 top defensive tackles. 

Boxing politics and the agendas of the big boxing promoters are also major factors. The leaders of each boxing organization has a vested interest in keeping control of its titles (and associated money flows), and will work with boxing promoters to keep control of each title. In essence, each of the boxing organizations keeps rankings for different weight classes. Boxers may choose to compete for one of more titles of the same weight class across multiple organizations. The article also notes: 

Price of the board - get a cheap board or a higher quality board? Buying new or used could also be a factor Men or women's board - generally a criteria for women, since men/boys will usually get a board designed for men The type of snowboarding the rider will be participating in - "Different snowboards are build for different terrains and different styles of riding." Length of the board - varies greatly by individual preference 

If you live in the United States, you can check out the Junior Olympic Archery Development (JOAD) website, which is affiliated with USA Archery. For other countries, a visit to FITA (Federation Internationale de Tir a l'Arc) site might be a good starting point. The JOAD site contains a FAQ that describes aspects of the program. The JOAD site itself notes: 

The NBA included rights to broadcast playoff games in the $24 billion extension signed with Disney/ESPN and TNT. This deal covers both regular season and playoff games: 

Yes, teams in the NBA are allowed to purchase draft picks with cash. Per this San Jose Mercury News article: 

So for all major indoor court competitions, rule 9.2.1 permits hits by any part of the body. For beach volleyball, FIVB has a similar rule in the 2009-12 rules: 

According to this article, up to two defensive players can have helmets with radios/microphones to communicate with their defensive coaches, starting in the 2008 NFL season. However, only one player can have a radio on the field at any given play. Each of these radio-equipped helmets is marked with a green dot. Usage: 

There is a caveat - these paycheck rules can change periodically due to the CBA rules negotiated by the leagues and their player associations. 

Notably, per Wikipedia (Summer and Winter, the host sites for the 1940 Games were also to be replaced, had the Olympics not been canceled due to the onset of World War II: 

So it seems that you'd need gloves of at least 10 oz. for competition - perhaps larger ones if required for your weight class. However, you should consult with your trainer/instructor to determine what type of gloves you should use for training. Perhaps he/she might want you to use heavier gloves to work on endurance, or gloves with more padding for protection. 

These resources suggest that there's a wide range of drills that one can do without purchasing any equipment - at minimum shadow play and footwork drills can be done without any equipment. At the high end, buying a robot or doing video analysis can be costly, but can provide good returns if solo practice is very important.
