Today, there are many polytheists and neopagans who worship the ancient Roman gods. They are, however, a very new development, and not the descendants of an unbroken line stretching back to the Roman Republic. There was a long period (unless I'm wildly mistaken) when the gods of ancient Rome were fully dead. As Christianity was rising, though, there was a significant amount of time, both before and after Christianity became the official religion on the Roman Empire, when Christians and pagans lived side-by-side. Some of this was peaceful, some of it was less so. But at a certain point, there were simply none of the latter group left, and Christianity had (aside from other religious minorities like the Jews) completed the conversion of the Empire, and of Europe. When did that happen? What is the last reference we have to people worshiping Jupiter, Mars, Venus, etc? Preferably, what is the last reference that is generally accepted as valid, and not simply an accusation of scandalous pagan practices as a way to slander a Christian's name? 

The image of Hitler is very well-formed in the modern public imagination: stern, stoic, focused, commanding and intimidating, with a powerful oratory skill and a terrifying ability to stir up passion within his followers. Ask anyone to do a Hitler impression and they will immediately do one of two things: shout and wave an arm defiantly, or clasp both hands behind their back and glower. He is an iconic villain, and there is very little footage or testimony that I have seen which "humanizes" him as anything other than stern, commanding, and deadly. That being said, we also know that Hitler's public image was very carefully maintained. Public events were staged with care and precision, personal information (such has his family and his relationship with Eva Braun) was withheld to keep him seeming larger than life, etc. Hitler wanted to project an image of power and command, both to his followers and to the rest of the world. However, on the flip side, we also have bits of information about Hitler's personal life that go counter to this image of the dour commander. He was an artist, for example, and his paintings (at least the ones I've seen) have generally shown quaint, tranquil, even idyllic scenes. He may have enjoyed doodling Disney characters and he was a huge fan of American popular cinema, such as King Kong and Snow White. Taking both sides of this into account, do we have any idea of what Hitler was like in private? Was he actually a stern man when he was with friends, or was that simply a facade? Obviously he needed some backbone to do everything he did, but when he wasn't commanding armies or ordering construction projects, did he ever relax? And if so, how? Do we have any accounts of his sense of humor, or whether he was personally a very funny person? Was he a picky eater or a foodie, did he enjoy dancing? Did he tend to quietly "preside" over parties and gatherings, or was he always the center of attention? Do any unbiased firsthand accounts exist of Hitler's general personality and demeanor, either during his time as Fuhrer or before it? 

These masculine forms were still a little bit bulkier than today's styles would prefer (look up some Abercrombe ads and you'll see mostly longer, thinner torsos), but such is the nature of fashion. The main thing to consider here is practicality: the Captain America physique takes a LOT of training and effort to maintain, without actually giving that many benefits above similar levels of strength but with slightly higher body fat percentages. It looks great on camera, but few professional soldiers are going to want to put in the extra effort to get there for no reason. Go to any real army base, firestation, or construction site today, and you'll see basically the same thing: a few guys who go all-out to look perfect, and the rest who are very strong but with less chiseled definition due to their higher body fat ratios. (It's worth noting that word "chiseled" to indicate highly defined muscles, and its connection to chiseling a statue.) I've seen soldiers who looked straight-up fat, but who could seriously throw down because they were still incredibly strong under the top layer. The actors in those movies are essentially male models, and their workout regimen is aimed at making them look fantastic. The ancients had the same impulse for their statues and artwork. But the next time you see an image of real soldiers with their shirts off, whether they're from World War 2 or Vietnam or Afghanistan or Iraq, you'll be getting a better glimpse at what soldiers throughout the ages have looked like: strong, powerful, well-maintained, but also (hopefully) a little more well-fed. 

In all the accounts I've read, when the great empires of the ancient Mediterranean needed to talk to each other, they sent an ambassador or a messenger. As in, someone from Country A brought a message to Country B, and then returned home. Of course, in modern times, most major nations have permanent embassies within the capitols (or other cities) of other nations, so that there's (for example) a British ambassador ready in Washington D.C. in case any British/American talks are required. What is the first example of this? Was there a building or a home of a prominent Egyptian living in Rome during the time of the Republic, serving as the Pharaoh's representative? Did Charlemagne have a standing presence in Byzantium, or Philip II in England? What is the first example of two sovereign nations having permanent, standing offices within each other's territories for the purpose of ongoing diplomatic contact? 

The tendency of each generation to look fondly on the "good old days" and to disparage the next generation is well-known. I remember reading some poem from ancient Egypt lamenting the moral failings of the younger generation, and it sounded exactly like something that might be written today. But has the opposite ever happened? Has any generation, on average, developed a consensus that the next generation was more ethical, more worthy, or simply better than they themselves had been? 

Do we have any indication what Hitler's plans would have been had the Allies continued to appease him? If the invasion of Poland had been allowed, do we know what he would have done next? Some planning document or minutes from a meeting, perhaps, where they discussed what their next steps might be? It seems pretty clear from his rhetoric and later actions that Hitler was, to some degree, picking a fight. That is, he wanted to go to war, if not against the world then at least against certain enemies like Russia so he could get his much-discussed "breathing room." But was that the only purpose of the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the Anschluss, the occupation of Czechoslovakia, the invasion of Poland, etc? To get as much as he could before the bullets inevitably started flying? Or was there an end goal, some ultimate phase that he was aiming for, in lieu of (or in advance of) outright war? 

To the casual observer, the Holy Roman Empire seems locked in time, continuing its almost feudal tradition even while every other part of Europe was consolidating into nations and empires. By the time Prussia conquered the rest of what we now call Germany, Britain and France and Spain had been (at least nominally) unified under single heads of state for the better part of a millennium. What took so long? Why didn't Germany get consolidated alongside her neighbors into a single empire? And what kept the other major powers of Europe from gobbling the pieces of the Holy Roman Empire up amongst themselves? 

If you discount the germs and the gunpowder, how did the average Aztec warrior match up against the average Spaniard facing him? As I understand it European metallurgy was considerably more advanced, but was it decisive or did it just give them an advantage? Were the Aztecs able to pierce Spanish armor? Were their weapons effective against Spanish tactics? A vital part of Cortez's battle plan included rallying local tribes to his cause, but then again even a few dozen Navy SEALS wouldn't be able to stand up to a continent's-worth of angry locals, so needing allies in the New World is kind of a given. But facing off against a similarly-sized group of Aztec warriors, how likely would a Spanish victory be? 

I've seen a number of scifi/fantasy stories (most recently the second season of Avatar: The Last Airbender) in which nominally-powerful leaders are insulated from the events of their own countries by their advisors or generals, to the point where they don't even know that a war is being waged beyond the palace walls. In real history there have been plenty of countries with figurehead leaders whose input was more official than practical, but has there ever been a leader who was supposed to be practically in charge, but whose advisors kept them unaware of a war that they should have been leading? 

I was recently re-watching the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Masks, (because I'm not a nerd even a little bit), and an interesting thought struck me: the culture portrayed in that episode seems to have had a pantheon centered around an incredibly cruel, if not outright evil, torturer-Queen deity named Masaka. The other gods from her pantheon seem to either be hiding from her, fearing her, or trying to counter her influence. This is not unlike the episode Devil's Due, in which another society seems to hold the negative deity, a devil-figure named Ardra, above all others. It made me wonder, have any historical cultures revered a negative or evil deity as their primary or most-powerful figure? Obviously plenty of primary deities (such as Zeus or Odin or even the Old Testament Yahweh) have been shown to be cruel, callous, or capricious at times, but these gods are also heavily tied to ideas like justice, courage, or mercy. They are, ultimately, positive forces in the universe and toward humanity. Have any societies held a strictly evil or malevolent deity above all others? EDIT: In response to several commenters, I thought I'd clarify: I'm talking about gods whose own worshippers considered the god a force of evil, not those who are interpreted as such by outsiders, and certainly not a discussion of whether religion itself is positive. I'm saying that Zeus, Odin, and the Judeochristian God are all viewed by their followers as "good." Were any pantheon-topping gods seen by their own worshippers as primarily malevolent, rather than benevolent? 

In plenty of myths and stories from ancient (and not-so-ancient) history, people are able to fly or climb all the way up to the "dome of the sky," breathing all the way. But even once science had developed enough to make it clear that there was no "dome" and that astronomical objects were an incredible distance away, people were nowhere near the level of technology to reach the upper atmosphere and see what conditions were like at high altitude. At a certain point, measurements of air pressure could indicate that the higher you go on a mountain, the thinner the air gets. Such a measurement could easily lead to the deduction that at a certain elevation the air would disappear entirely, but was such a connection ever made? When was the first time that scientists (or philosophers, etc) suggested that the air surrounding the world might only go so high, and that beyond it was an airless emptiness or void? And when it happened, what was the discovery or deduction that led them to believe that was the case? 

Obviously, once the atomic bombs dropped in 1945, the war was almost over. There wasn't much time to rebuild, or even offer aid, to the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki before the Japanese surrendered and the Americans started arriving, which no doubt changed how things like war damage and reconstruction were handled. But within that period before the end of the war, what did the Japanese government do in response to the bombings? The Wikipedia entry contains a lot of information about the bombings, but barely any about the subsequent relief efforts or response. Was there much of a relief effort for the survivors, or were there no resources to spare? Did the try to rebuild anything, or did they basically just abandon the sites and focus on other areas? Did they respond quickly, or did it take them some time to decide what to do? And once the Americans did start arriving in Japan, did these efforts change, or did they continue largely unaffected by the surrender? 

The Nazis were, as much as any other political group in modern history, masters of iconography and symbolism. The swastika, the eagle and wreath, the solid stone architecture, the sweeping art deco designs, the long red banners, the unique salute, the cathedral of light, and so on. They consistently used symbolism and iconography to spread their message and demonstrate their power to the world. I'm wondering, how much of that symbolism came from Hitler himself, and how much came from people around him? Obviously some of those symbols (like the swastika and the eagle/wreath) are much older than Nazism, but someone still had to have the thought, "hey, you know that old symbol from history, let's use that." Was that person Hitler? Or did he just approve someone else's design? I'm trying to get a sense of how much personal talent Hitler had for iconic design, vs how much talent he had for identifying talented people who could help his cause. 

During the era of the landbridge across the Bering Strait, evidence suggests that people traveled from Asia to North America by foot, becoming the first humans in the Americas and the ancestors of the Native American peoples. That being said, even today the Bering Strait isn't terribly wide. About 50 miles at its narrowest point, roughly analogous to the English Channel and closer than Japan is to Korea. It's not a terribly hospitable environment at either end, so travel might not have been considered worth it, but given how humans tend to work their way into every nook and cranny of a landscape, it seems odd that there wasn't consistent (if infrequent) travel between Alaska and Siberia even after the landbridge disappeared. Is there any evidence for travel, especially consistent back-and-forth travel, between Asia and North America before the modern age, but after the landbridge disappeared and foot-travel became impossible? 

Ancient prophecies, especially those of ancient Greece and the Oracle of Delphi, were famously tricky. There are dozens of stories of great leaders being tripped up by double-meanings and misinterpretations, usually to their own destruction. Now, obviously hindsight is 20/20, but some of those twists and tricks seem painfully obvious to modern audiences. For example, when the Oracle tells you "If you go to war, a great empire will be destroyed," even a schoolchild will recognize that that might be your empire, rather than the enemy's... And yet, over and over, great leaders and terrible generals misinterpret their prophecies, and go to meet their doom. Which fits wonderfully with the ancient preoccupation with hubris, so I'm sure they had no problem with it as they retold the story, but it does raise the question: Did any ancient prophecy-seekers recognize the tricky nature of prophecies, and make decisions or take action based on the possibility that the Oracle's words may have more than one meaning? Do we have any records of people trying to outsmart the Oracle?
