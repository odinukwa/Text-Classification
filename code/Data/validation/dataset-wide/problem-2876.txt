It looks like this is from Daodeijing chapter 27. Given that, I want to preface my answer by saying that I do not know of anyone who works in Chinese philosophy that believes in the historicity of Laozi (Lao Tzu). Instead, we believe this document to be a multiply re-organized text that includes many Taoist notions. (See for instance Franklin Perkins, Heaven and Earth are not Humane, 82). Given that, the literal text is on ctext.org but it won't let me quote it here. A key point in Taoist texts is that we should not identify shàn with goodness in the common sense. That might be more plausible for the Confucian texts, but for Taoists it's not clear that they think standard morality has anything to teach us. The portion we want comes after the 故 (therefore), but it's also useful to look at the part before that. In this context, the ctext translation which renders it as "skilful" is probably better. This ties in the with Zhuangzi's notion of skilfullness which may or may not mean "good" in the moral sense. Instead, it means the one who has wu-wei connection with the Tao. Thus, a better translation is 

I would like to focus on the third one's first variant, what I've called here natural authority. Hegel has an interesting critique of social contract theories -- which is this: they depend on a bizarre myth. The myth being that there was a "state of nature" where we were all beating each other senseless until we realized not beating each other senseless was a better social organization. Turns out, that's not the experience of most of us. Instead, we are raised in families where we are nurtured and love -- imperfectly and in flawed ways but still so (I hope dinner was not a fight to get enough scraps of left overs until you are finally strong enough to slay you father Chronos). So oddly, the state of nature is that we grow up in families where we are protected. According to Aristotle, it is natural for children to love and accept the authority of their parents in that circumstance, and it is natural for there to be love between parent and child. One nice thing in the Hegelian variant of this answer is that we don't have to do exactly what we see in nature. There's no need for us to accept there should be an alpha-ape with a giant harem who beats down everyone else. Instead, we can think about biological realities and work on creating social realities that maximize the flourishing of our families. I think one component is that it's sensible for there to be de minimis a structure such that parents have authority over their children. 

My money is the on apocryphal one but I don't think arises from a confusion with other ancient philosophers -- but rather a confusion about the veracity of the 19th century source and some idealization. 

The use of the terms are indeed confusing in the case of Kant. One main issue is that "realism" means many different things. In this case "empirical realism" can have two distinct meanings each of which Kant engages in a different way: "empirical realism" #1 - empirical things are real. Or to reword that, that which we encounter through the senses actually exists. On this claim Kant is most definitely a realist in that he thinks those things are real. Thus, Kant is a metaphysical realist about the existence of empirical things. empirical realism #2 that which we encounter empirically is the real. In other words, we encounter things as they are. Here, the claim could be true or false depending on how we are defining "the real." The reason is due to the forms of sensibility and categories of the understanding. For Kant, we don't know or sense things-in-themselves. Instead, we place things under the forms of sensibility (space and time) when we notice them and we encounter things as objects when we know them. For Kant, these are the only type of access we have to things. But these things remain actual -- they are not accidentally connected to the things themselves. Thus, Kant's epistemological relationship to whether what we encounter in sense is the real is complicated. Transcendental idealism is a thesis about what we bring to the encounter. Transcendental refers to the need to move past Understanding (Verstand) to Reason (Vernunft) in order to comprehend how mind is interacting with things to produces perceptibles (Vorstellung) and objects. Transcendental idealism is an idealism precisely in rejecting the thesis Kant attributes to Berkeley as "transcendental realism" which is the idea that the actions of mind are what are real and the things themselves fleeting. So to summarize, Kant considers himself an empirical realist because he thinks the things we encounter through our apparatus do exist (metaphysical claim), but he considers himself a transcendental idealist because we encounter them through the apparatus through mental objects (epistemological claim). 

While I understand what you mean by using this construction, there's something inadequate about this wording if we're going to be true to Kant and his idea of the enlightenment. The main potentially problematic phrase is trying to act according to. There's two issues, first, this seems to present the Categorical Imperative as something outside yourself. For Kant, this is the definition of "heteronomy" an issue he addresses indirectly at one point in the Groundwork (the shopkeeper example) and directly in the "autonomy" formulation of the CI. The second issue is that this presents this as "trying." This might be okay depending on what exactly is meant, but for Kant, there is no standard of trying, there's do and don't. A basic reason is that for Kant, the Categorical Imperative is nothing other than what pure reason dictates in the moral realm (this is stated in the preface to the Groundwork). 

The key is in the nuances of the word "add up" and the world "analyze". Nagel is not here saying that all of the physical parts together cannot constitute a mental experience but that however this works, it cannot be merely additive. Nagel is asserting that if we're looking at say "tasting chocolate," there's no half of the brain that does half of the tasting and another half the other half of the tasting. Instead, for it to be tasting, everything has to work together or there's not tasting at all. Thus, the physical bits don't "add up" because the mental is not the sort of thing that's gotten to by merely adding up a whole bunch of other things. Maybe to give an analogy might help. Putting one leg ahead of the other rapidly means that I'm running, and I'm still running even if you shorten the length of my run by several footfalls. Conversely, if I'm writing a sentence in English: "he walks the dog", the sentence is no longer grammatical if you take a single word out of it. What remains is something else entirely. This is the essence of the "add up" claim. Conversely, for physical things, we can (until we hit the limits of physics or our apparatus) analyze them into smaller physical processes. Thus, they are like "running" above. A mental state on the other hand seems like the sentence above -- at least for Nagel -- meaning it doesn't work if you take any piece away from it. (I would wager there are several big philosophers who'd disagree with him, but that's kind of what it means to have a position in these debates).
