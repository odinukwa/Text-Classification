But of course, ours would be a lot larger and flatter. Your dome could deploy from the perimeter of the city and once in place, extend titanium panels to fill the gaps. Obviously, it would need some other form of exotic technology to expand so much - perhaps the city has huge stores of molten titanium under it and using some shaping trick it alloys the titanium with tungsten (to give it a higher melting point than plain titanium) and then funnels more titanium through the bars, suspending it through magnetism or something, until it cools into titanium plates. 

Based on what we know about planetary formation and geology, the mantle and liquid core provide us with a magnetic field. Without one, we'd have no protection from the solar wind: 

link to plot If shaped this way, we can place a circular plate under the city about 900m, to give us the needed field. It doesn't end there though because if we just have a field, activating it will affect everything in its range - it won't just create a nice dome. If this was designed the repel matter and we power it, it would make the entire city explode around it. So we need to carefully shape it. 

Gory details You make \$40k/year, no kids. Minus the \$10k, you're in a 15% bracket so paying ~$4000 in tax. You make \$40k/year, 3 kids. You are underwater because your $45k 3-kid tax > your income. Make \$100k/year, 0 kids. Taxable income is \$90k/year putting you in a 30% bracket, tax is ~22,000 figuring for the curve. You keep $78,000. Make \$100k/year, 3 kids. Taxable income is 30% less (-\$30k) - the 10k standard - the \$45k tax you pay, or \$15k. That's in a 10% bracket so \$1500. Total tax is \$46,500, you keep $53,500, or about what an American nets after also paying state tax, FICA, healthcare and higher education. Make \$1M/year, 0 kids. You're in a 45% tax bracket, so \$400,000ish tax, you keep \$600k. Make \$1M/year, 3 kids. Deduct \$10k, \$300,000 for the 3 kids, and the \$45,000 kid tax you paid, giving \$645,000 taxable income. Taxed at 45%, about \$255,000. With the kid tax that's \$300k, so \$700k you keep. You're being paid $100k to raise 3 kids. Make \$10M/year, 0 kids. Taxable income is \$9.990M, putting you in a 50% bracket for almost all of it. Tax is \$5,000,000, you keep \$5,000,000. Make \$10M/year, 3 kids. Deductions are the 10k standard, 30% (\$3M) for the kids, and the \$45,000 tax you paid for the kids. That's \$3,055,000. Net income is \$7M, back in the 50% bracket so \$3.5M. Add the \$45,000 kid tax you paid, tax is $3.545M, you keep \$6.455M. You are literally being paid \$1.455M to have kids. Make \$10M/year, 9 kids. Deductions are 10k, 90% (9M) for 9 kids, and $135,000 kid tax you paid. That's \$9,145,000, leaving \$855,000 taxable at 45% or ~\$370,000 plus the kid tax. You keep \$9.5 million. You are literally being paid \$4.5M to have 9 kids. 

Now how long can we expect a car to work until it breaks down? Lets assume cars last for miles on average (half of what they're expected to if maintenance is available[11]) and they're already half-way there, so about miles left on each car on average. Based on the average daily consumption of gasoline and the average fuel efficiency[7] we get about miles per day which is very low, so lets assume a highest bound of miles per day. That gives us about days average life for each car, a bit over a year. If the average usage is half that much, we get days, which is a bit over 2 years. Obviously, people skilled with car maintenance, with available parts or scrap to turn into parts and a bit of creativity will get them working for longer, but I doubt you'll get cars older than 5-6 years still in working condition. Of course, that's speculation. So I'd say, as a rule of thumb, halve the amount of working cars every 2 years after the apocalypse. After a decade, you're left with about cars in the US, most of them hosts to parts of their fallen brethren. In 20 years, you have about a thousand cars left. This further removes fuel as an issue - it will never run out by car usage alone, but the cars will run out pretty soon. 

And we better get dinner before all the restaurants close. At this point we're doing command-line just as we do now, except using an actual VT100 instead of a Terminal/PuTTY window. We won't have an because we don't have a recursive filesystem yet, but small steps Ellie. Speaking of small steps, we start writing high level languages and cross-developing; i.e. use the Imsai to cross-compile 80386 to get the Compaq 386 booted up, (mind you, your very first x86 code would be native 32-bit and have no concept of the old 64k/1MB RAM barriers), then use that to cross-compile for the PowerMac G3, etc. The hard part is coordination The problem is, this effort is happening independently in every single location where a functioning Altair/Imsai/Digital Group machine exists. Now the challenge is coordinating the efforts when the phones are down. If the phones worked, any museum-piece 300 baud modem would get the crews talking and sharing code. And the phone company is not idle; they're trying to figure out how to get something up. About a day after telecomm is up, someone will have (re)written BBS software, assuming they didn't find an old copy of BBS source code in BYTE magazine. Now we're doing the same thing we do right here. This increases the speed of the rebuild ballistically - especially since every nation in the world has identified it as a national strategic priority. Firmware is an annoyance Unfortunately many components nowadays, like USB fobs, have "firmware" running on a lower level of the system, and don't really have a "hard" backdoor like the Imsai front-panel to force-load a bootstrap loader. If that firmware is gone, each machine would have to be hacked or scrapped. However that won't be a problem until we get into 2000's hardware, so that Pentium and Mac Quadra 800 will probably still run fine. And with those we can redesign/replace the other. It's true that a Quadra 800 doesn't have a front panel of switches. It does, however, have traces on its PCB, and you would have to do some hardware hacking to get a bootstrap loader into it, or just learn to burn EPROMs. We know the destination Since the design problems are extremely well-defined and well-understood -- all that remains is code-slinging. We don't need to reinvent the wheel, we all know what wheels look like, we only need to carve one. Remember, almost all existing code is understood by somebody who is alive, and who if pressed could rewrite it. Better. It would be the best thing ever. It would let us (heh) "reboot" our computing systems design from scratch, rather than constantly drag along old legacy infrastructure that makes everything complicated. Code would be streamlined and unified partly because we have to get the world back up, and there isn't time to support a bunch of legacy ways to do that same thing. DOSbox gone. Windows gone. Flash gone. HTML/CSS/AJAX morass streamlined. Etc. etc. The government would stomp all the patent issues owing to the national emergency. Haven't you ever wished you could just take a month and scratch-rewrite all your legacy spaghetti code and obsolete standards? Now you can. 

That's a bit of an oversimplified view of civilization. If I understand your premise properly, you're talking about small tribes or nomads gathering together to found a town. Leadership is not dictatorship First of all, they would already have some form of leadership. Even tribes and small groups have de facto leaders, established either by consensus (people just seem to go to them for questions or guidance in daily matters and they have everyone's trust) or by heritage (the chief's offspring become chiefs in their own right and people are fine with it). While this resembles, in the modern political sense, a dictatorship, it is in practice very far from it. Dictatorships have and require a huge distance from the low rungs of society - town leadership is rarely that far removed, unless it is supported by a more powerful authority. In a mere town, what kind of dictatorship could you have? And if your concern is for the longterm implications of that model, there is nothing to indicate what the future political structure will be, either way. Pretty much every early civilization had de facto leaders in the local sense and grew within a strict monarchy. It was only millennia later that some form of official recognition of public will was established within political structures. Politics hasn't always worked the same Even this is oversimplification. Under ancient monarchies, the general will of the people was taken under consideration - monarchs and leaders who ignored it where considered unjust and where unliked, no matter their authority, power or the effects of their actions. Again, even after the need to reflect public opinion was established, it was a long long time until we had anything resembling modern democracy. The ancient greek and roman republics where heavily aristocratic and only the rich could really vote - 9/10 of the population had no say in anything. It was just a glorified lobbyistic monarchy. Nope Considering the above and how recent the notion of a "dictatorship" really is, I'd say no, it doesn't lead to any kind of dictatorship. It would be a long time before there was authority far removed from most people and it would probably be centuries or millennia until public representation was a clear ingredient in political systems in order to make ignoring it (a dictatorship) an ingredient as well. Overall, it's impossible to tell how a civilization will develop just by observing its early stages - especially when we have so few examples to work with. It could develop in all kinds of ways depending on events, contact with other cultures, social reforms, who knows. Scales The formation of democracy straight up is nearly impossible - there is a simple reason: the problem it solves has not been detected or defined yet. Until then, you have implicit and de facto leaders - that structure happens in small groups due to efficiency and division of labor; until it is proven to be ineffective (which in our civilization happened only a few centuries ago), it will be maintained to the bitter end. Also, your impression that a city can only be started by the initiative of one person, is in conflict with how communities and cities form in general. People aggregate to cooperate better - when there's more people, there's more hands to work and less work for everyone, because work and its yield don't scale linearly. That's why you get tribes in the first place. Often, cities spring up where resources are, because everyone goes there - they also emerge around mines, fields, factories etc. . It has to do with proximity and the efficiency of communities, not initiative. From an individual's point of view, cities just happen. 

Since what makes an AI an AI and not components is entirely virtual... ... Death for an AI means it is gone. There is nothing to bury. We do indeed commemorate the passing of humans whose bodies are lost, like the Challenger or Columbia 7, or sailors lost at sea. And that is an option: The empty casket. Or the name on the memorial. 

Tie it to something they want If you play World of Warcraft and want to win in PvP, you will learn the macro language (basically LUA). You want to turn your lights on, every home is a smart home and you better be able to write some Insteon code or you'll be freezing in the dark. We already have a programming language you need to get by, it's called English (here). 

Yes. Because there's a huge opportunity for skipping technological steps. For instance, if you have enough people who know how to formulate epoxy resin out of available oils, you get to sidestep the metal ages and go straight to making high-strength things out of FRP. Any schoolchild can make a DC generator, and countless adults can replicate Tesla's work on three-phase power gridding. You would have wind and hydro going within a year. Obviously the key is we already know how to do those things. It's a lot easier to do something if you absolutely know it can be done, and a rough idea of how. 

Nebulae are indeed what I know as an alternative location as well. They not only contain the essential ingredients (including discharges to help along) but there's rocks passing through them all the time, which is what leads to panspermia according to some theorists. The problem with this, as far as life is concerned, is that when we're talking about "ingredients" and "conditions", we're talking about just enough to form bacteria and very simple organisms (in this case "extremophiles" that can survive space and atmospheric re-entry or first-entry in their case). They can chew on rocks for all time, but there just isn't anything to terraform, in order to allow more complex life to arise. You don't get giant amoebas in space nor space-goats, launching themselves between rocks. Also, this process, while likely in nebulae, would take orders of magnitude more time than it needs on a planet, because everything's so far apart, so you need to allow for a universe that has hundreds of billions of years available to it. Since I can't think of other cases that would count as "space" I'll stop here. To sum up, you can get life in outer space, but it's really really hard to get complex life in space. 

Earth is a very, very windy place as well; ask any pilot. It's just not that way on the surface. I don't agree it would increase wind force proportionally. Ultimately it's about energy. Wind is simply a manifestation of the energy hitting the planet from the sun(s). 12x the density takes 12x the energy to move, and so it'll move slower and impact with the same original force. Ground effect For instance ground effect is why windmill towers are taller than they strictly need to be to keep blades from hitting the ground; to get up in the good fast air. I would think denser air is going to be more impacted by ground effect. Proximity to the ground will slow the wind. Or, the wind up high will be worse - might matter to the trees. Trees I seem to recall seeing another recent post on here that discusses how trees and gravity relate. Your weaker gravity means trees will be able to more easily lift the water they need to thrive. However the wind will present a real challenge for them and require they build themselves beefy. Keep in mind the limiting factor isn't daily wind, it's peak wind - as in the peak wind in a tree's productive lifetime. As a practical manner, it's likely the planet's fauna would evolve** within the forests, using them for protection from the elements. As such, they may not need developments to help them with the wind. You would have to ask whether such developments would give them advantage. Is there stuff beyond the islands of forests which would give reason to leave? The redwood forests depend very strongly on each other to resist the wind: alone they cannot stand, as a forest they help each other break the wind. That's why it's a big deal when a forest company clearcuts to a property line; they stress and endanger the trees on the far edge of the line. For your society that means there may need to live amongst the forest as the open areas may be inhospitable. The stewardship of the forest would be a survival priority, the forest would effectively be community property, which would mean property ownership would work differently. It would certainly change the nature of war: does the enemy routinely destroy your forest to defeat you, or is that so uncomprehensively destructive as to be considered a war crime akin to nuclear war? Would the latter be the domain of the civilized Great Powers, whilst ruined forests are the mark of the civil-war-ravaged third world? Structures Perhaps cities would have complexes of high walls which do the same thing as the trees, breaking the wind so wind speeds are workable on the surface. Perhaps this is done with usable buildings as much as practicable, resulting in a unique, interlocked style of city-building. ** Assuming your planet does evolve. Some are created by powerful beings, especially in fiction. 

The first reason off the top of my head is the time it would take to find a new world that is already habitable or easier to terraform, versus the time it would take to terraform a world that's close by. Habitable planets are not that easy to find Faster-than-light travel is a not a trivial problem and it may take much longer to solve than terraforming. Even if you do manage to achieve FTL travel, the speeds might not be ideal - at light speed, it can take a decade to reach a close-by star system only 10 light years away (a short distance by astronomical standards) and that's assuming that you have one that close that has habitable planets. If you're unlucky, even achieving many times the speed of light could still not be enough. In fiction, FTL travel tends to be extremely fast - moving between star systems is a matter of hours or days. At those speeds, it is indeed a preferable choice to terraforming because you can search hundreds of star systems in a time shorter than it would take to build a basic colony. An additional problem could be how much you can carry with your faster-than-light ship - if the cost is too high, perhaps terraforming is still cheaper despite the enormous cost. To colonize a planet you need thousands of people (44 thousand by 2013 estimates[1]) and a lot of materials and resources. Perhaps you're not sure if it's actually habitable and you have to check first - that's extra time and resources. FTL drives are, at this moment, purely theoretical - we don't even know if they're possible and indeed in some fiction, there is no FTL. Terraforming on the other hand, while a huge engineering task that requires a lot more knowledge than we have, is almost certainly possible. Proximity Even if it's easy to travel to distant star systems in search of habitable planets, it's going to be much cheaper to move within one if you have that capability (unless you're using mass drivers and only make very few of them). By terraforming a planet that's close by, like Mars, you get a whole new planet where people can live and very close to the homeworld. That means it's going to be faster to develop it, trade is cheaper, people can move faster between planets etc. . Another advantage is that we've studied our own solar system enough and its planets as well. A new star system might have configurations we're not experienced with - you could have celestial phenomena that surprise you or geological phenomena that do the same. To put it in Earth terms: it might be hard to grow food in the desert that's next to your city, but you might still prefer working with it in order to expand this city instead of moving far away to found a new city. All of this of course depends on the relative energy and time costs of traveling astronomical distances, versus the engineering costs of transforming an entire planet. Prior establishment You might prefer to terraform a planet, not because it's cheaper, but because you already have colonies on it, but they have to live in habitats. If you, for example, colonize Mars before you have cheap FTL travel and by the time it's cheap enough to search for habitable planets there's already hundreds of millions of people living on Mars colonies, you can't just relocate all of them. You might find new worlds but eventually decide to terraform Mars as well, so that it's friendlier to human life.
