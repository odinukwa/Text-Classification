I found this map of Pennsylvania with dirt roads overlaid a while back. Not aware of similar projects but I imagine/hope they are out there. 

You're right, you want to space it between the shell and cup. You can put spacers on either side to get the chainline right. Most cranksets come with spacers (2.5 mm is probably the most useful size for you) but if yours didn't any LBS should have a few to sell you. Something like this: $URL$ (I don't know if these work with hollowtech BB's or not) You'll probably want to get an assortment of sizes if you can, and use as few as possible to get things lined up (I assume this would help maximize BB stiffness, but really I just hate having excessive spacers - makes it more likely I'll lose one when disassembling/reassembling). 

So I decided to take the plunge and try the tubeless wheels. I've got about 80 miles of road and gravel riding on them now, and figured I should start formulating an answer. I ended up using the stan's alpha 400 rim because of my weight and the lack of rim brake compatibility in their cross specific rim. So far it's been as advertised. The tires can run at much lower pressures than I was able to run with tubes, to the point that if I come back onto the road I actually feel like the tire is going to tear off the rim when taking tight corners too fast (these are corners on neighborhood trails and such, it is not nearly as pronounced when riding on real roads). The lower pressure lets the tires hook up really well off road - probably not as well as a wide set of tubulars but much better than the tubed tires I've used in the past. So I would say yes, there are significant benefits. There are a few gotchas to be aware of though, namely the lack of tire selection - the tires I wanted to run would not lock into the bead. Even at low pressures they would blow off. I ended up going with a set of (non-tubeless) continentals that my shop had lying around. It took a while for sealant to permeate the tire, but they are working great now. I think there are only a handful of tubeless specific cross tires at this time, but feel certain more will be coming. With the alpha (road wheels) you also need a special rim strip (in addition to the yellow tape) for higher volume cross tires. With some tires this is not needed (or even detrimental), but it ended up being needed for mine. I'm sure you could jury-rig something but I would just plan on spending another $40 or so on these strips (just a rubber strip with a valve stem built in). I've been told this is not needed with the iron cross rims. All things considered, I think it was worth the hassle so far. The stans wheels are great - very stiff when cornering, and I saved almost a pound at the rims off what my factory wheels weighed. I will come back and post more once I've done some singletrack riding and a race or two. edit - so I've done some singletrack riding and one race, and now I'm really starting to see the benefit. The stans wheels don't really allow super low pressures (I burped at about 22 psi while preriding the race course) but they feel great at 30. This is for a 220 lb rider with 35mm tires, using the rubber strips. The wheels hooked up really well on the slick grass course, and held up well to dismounts/remounts. At this point I'm ready to call the experiment a success. Looking back the only thing I would have done differently is go with a tubeless-specific tire (it took a long time for sealant to sufficiently permeate the non-tubeless tires I used). 

The inner ring of the 5700 crankset will be removed as it will be a 1x10 setup. Would the chains that are compatible with the derailleur/cassette combination work with the crankset? 

I recently bought a pair of Qbicle Tangent fenders for my folding bike. The bolt for the derailleur hanger is in the way of the mount: 

What chain would be suitable for a drive train that uses a Deore SL-T610 right shifter, Deore RD-T610-SGS derailleur, 105 CS-5700 10-speed cassette (11t-28t), and 105 FC-5700 crankset? According to the Shimano compatibility chart, The RD-T610 is compatible with the 105 CS-5700. It's also stated that you can use the following chains: 

It mounts on the bottom bracket. When installing this, should a spacer also be installed on the other side of the bottom bracket? Right now, my crankset is a Shimano 105 FC-5700 with the inner chainring removed and my cassette is a 10-speed 105 11-28T. I was just wondering if a spacer would be added to the drive side, would that affect the chainline much? 

I don't remember where, but I read once that because a 3/32" chain is more flexible laterally than a 1/8" chain, it is more tolerant of imperfect chainlines. This makes sense to me, but I haven't seen any numbers to support it. So with an imperfect chainline you might see faster wear with 1/8". I suspect the difference in wear is imperceptible, especially with a steel cog. The combination of a 1/8" chain, imperfect chainline, and an aluminum 3/32" cog would probably be where you'd see the most increase in wear because you add a slight bit of play where the chain interfaces with the cog, but I still doubt you'd notice much additional wear. 

So I have a wheelset that I really like, only problem is the first time I rode the wheels a nipple came off the spoke when I launched off a speed bump going downhill. For a long time it was silent (the nipple must have been stuck in some stan's or something) but recently its come loose and rattles all over the place when braking. I am pretty sure this is going to drive me crazy. Looking for strategies that people have found successful for getting a nipple out in this situation. I figure if worst comes to worst I can take the tire off, remove the valve core and put a dab of rubber cement in the rim that will hopefully catch the nipple. But I'd like to fish it out if I can. 

Can you describe "not working properly"? Is it braking power, rotor rub, noise, lever throw,etc? Also, what brake model? Moz's idea for caliper alignment works well on most Avid brakes but it relies on a floating mount system that your setup ay not have. @David The presence of any oil on the pads or rotor is a bad sign (and also likely explains why the brakes no longer squeal as much) - what's the lever-resistance like? Can you pull the lever all the way into the bar? If they've never worked properly I'd suspect they need to be bled, or you could have a very small leak-you don't see any fluid then around the drums that press the pads into the rotor. You can service this yourself but it's finicky and requires a few specialized tools. It's usually the same price to have your bike shop bleed the brake as buying the manufacturers bleed kit, so I don't bother doing them myself. 

Also check out $URL$ when you just can't get it straight. The fact that there's a web site out there that only sells derailleur hangers is what makes the interwebs great. 

My commuter rig is an old trek mountain bike that I've converted to fixed gear with an ENO hub/crankset. I am thinking about going geared for the winter. I have a rear wheel that I built last year and never used (found the eccentric wheel on craigslist around the same time), an SLX rear derailleur and an LX shifter. Looking for a wide range cassette so I can take the bike offroad a bit more often, but I'm hoping to keep my 42t chainring on. I'm willing to take the risk that the ENO ring can work with a 9 speed chain. The best I've found is a shimano CS-HG61 (12-36) which I think would be more than enough, but if there's anything bigger available I'd like to know. Not interested in mods/adapters. 

When it gets really cold (or it is cold AND wet) I wear a pair of neoprene socks designed to keep kayaker's feet warm. I wear these over a pair of thin wool or acrylic socks, UNDER my shoes. I am primarily a mountain biker, and this seems much more reliable to me than the shoe covers that slip over, because of the chance of tearing the cover on something. I think the socks I have are something like these: $URL$ There are thicker models available but I prefer wearing the thin ones over the wool because it allows me to wear the neoprene ones many times before they need a wash. The coldest I've ridden with this combination was probably about 20 degrees with a few inches of snow on the ground and a couple of stream crossings, and while my shoes were soaked my feet felt great. 

But when I look at the crankset and chain compatibility, the only chains compatible with that crankset are: 

Is that derailleur hanger the only type of hanger that can be used for that kind of dropout? I could install the fender so that the bolt of the hanger would pass through the fender mount. The fender would be mounted at around 170Â°; it would just cover the area between the 9 to 11 o'clock positions. Would the fenders be useless at that angle? 

I have a 20x1.75" 6-speed folding bike with 52x14-28t drivetrain. Even with the gearing at 52x14, ~3.71 ratio, I can still pedal uphill. I also have a 700x25C fixed gear with 49x17t gearing or ~2.88 ratio. I have yet to try riding it on uphills so I'm not sure if it's going to be difficult to pedal with that gearing. I know that the gear inches depend on the ratio multiplied by the diameter of the wheels. Given that, I know that the gear inches of my folding bike is at around 74 while the fixed gear is at around 79. But which one actually determines how hard it is to pedal, the gear ratio or the gear inches? If it is the gear inches, would 5 inches higher be that significant? If it is, I'm thinking of getting an 18t or 19t cog.
