The problem is already solved. Joe will die in solitary confinement from thirst or starvation, as his guards and the officials responsible for replacing them all drop dead. 

As a writer of fantasy you will already know about "suspension of disbelief". If a setting in a story is not internally consistent or conflicts too much with a reader's own expectations, that will interfere with their immersion in the world and story. The big difference between fantasy/magic and science fiction is that many readers have a much more solid expectation about how things work if the word science is involved, where the fantasy genre has a much more basic and clich√© set of expectations. With magic, well it's magic. As long you don't violate the rules you make up, the reader will accept that's just 'how it works'. With science, you can make up your own rules (starships can move faster than light), but they need to be an extension on the real-world ones (by going through "hyperspace") to avert conflict with reader's understanding of things. Of course, if you just want an adventure story in space the requirements are not that hard. Borrow the more scientific stuff from an existing source and wing it for the rest. Most likely one of your friends will remark on unscientific stuff while proofreading and you can put a lampshade on it or come to this SE and ask "How to explain away X in my world". This is really no different from a fantasy setting. If your hero encounters a bunch of peasants handily dispatching a dragon without any explanation of how, readers will protest. Dragons are supposed to be fearsome and near invulnerable! Put a lampshade on it and you'll be okay: 

It gives the underclass license to imagine themselves a bit upper class by emulating their chosen, this gives them exactly the one thing they may lack: Freedom! (from being underclass). It gives the chosen the thing they need most: Adoration. It will be addictive as crack to them and they will engage with their fans and promote the behavior. 

Yes, it will lead to a great decrease in military budget. The armed forces that remain will have two or three tasks: 

Example time! A group of people have banded together and set up "Furryland". All avatars entering this zone instantly sprout a soft, smooth fur all over their bodies, while their faces take on an animal aspect and their eyes grow huge. This is maintained by the entire group, leaving them most of their budget for further private perversions mods. Any person entering can allow the mod to take effect without expending their own budget or decreasing that of the furries. If they resist, they will get priority and no change will happen, but this is taken out of the furries' budgets. Before long a group of hostile people is trying to ruin Furryland by making mud tornadoes and fighting the changes to their avatars, costing the furries their mod budgets. To prevent this, the furries set Furryland to be their home locations, abandoning any other claims they might have had. Now, the priority works as follows: The home location effects now override the mud tornado, with penalties going to the hostiles. The hostiles' personal resistance to the furry effect still overrides all, but it doesn't penalize the furries in their home location. One lone griefer tries another way: modding boulders out of thin air far above Furryland, then letting normal gravity drop them on the poor furries. He reasons that since the simulation is the one creating the big crash, the furries can't negate his mod. However, what happens is that with very little effort, barely more than a reflex, the people underneath the boulder can mod it away before it hits them or their home location, this being an exception to the rule that modding the default simulation costs effort/budget. Conclusion Within this framework, cooperation is rewarded greatly by the ability to create and maintain greater things, as well as protecting them through the "home" designation. Conflict is punished by diminished ability to change the simulation. With everyone having supreme authority over their own avatars, you don't need law enforcement, though people certainly can set up a cooperation to prevent "griefing" and other abuse, as well as organizing to create greater things on a cosmic scale. 

Assuming that weather phenomena need to produce benefits to justify their existence suggests you do not understand any of them. They are the result of a complex interaction of physical laws, so they simply happen when conditions cause them to. In the case of tornadoes the condition is a cold air front hitting a warm air front at a certain angle. Tornado Alley in the US just happens to be where warm Gulf air meets cold air from the Rockies and further north. Nothing short of major climate change and shifting wind patterns will change this. If you believe tornadoes are intentionally created by God, the most logical conclusion is that He is mighty pissed off at the American Midwest. Why that might be is a topic for religion, not Worldbuilding. 

Lava factories have many uses, but they are most essential for the world's safety, because they allow villains to be defeated in a climactic fight. Notable examples: 

Plan D: All of the above The odds of anyone (that is not you) caring about your preserved corpse more than all the decomposed ones in graveyards will be fairly low, so you need to have layers upon layers in your plan. Caretakers A small or medium company will be the best caretaker, but stay away from family run businesses, as you are almost guaranteed to get either a complete incompetent or someone with no interest in the business at all within 3-4 generations. If you amassed a sizable fortune, the best choice is a museum or a non-profit with some charitable goal that is likely to remain relevant for a long time. Respect for the founder/donor will get you some of the way, but the priority is to have a thorough selection and training program for the CEO to ensure focus and loyalty, and a succession program that can survive a few resignations or accidents. Lock down ownership of the building, grounds etc in a trust beyond the reach of the company itself for as much as that is possible. You could have a second company somewhere else in the world that manages enough money to buy the location/non-profit that houses your body if things go wrong, but the odds are much worse for this to succeed, so I wouldn't bother. Time capsules Let's assume the caretakers lose interest, fail or disappear for some reason. You don't want your facility to be easy to find, because you don't want to be found by a hobo that will dump your corpse so he can store his booze in the "fridge", looters that will strip the lab for valuable metals instead of waking you or even a random well-meaning person that presses the "thaw" button and then leaves when nothing seems to happen... With the facility well hidden, time capsules are you next layer. Put them in the museum itself, but also in places that you expect to last for at least a hundred years before they get torn down and rebuilt. It's hard to find those nowadays, but count on the power of neglect and budget cuts to stretch renovation time frames. Once activated or revealed, the time capsules should not directly point to your location. Address them to universities and research hospitals. Even if those don't exist anymore, people will get the right idea and bring them to a similar institute. Put some ambiguous and cryptic hints inside, spell out an encryption scheme and encode the vital information in DNA strands. This will ensure that only people with the right kind of equipment and knowledge (as well as a professional interest in seeing if they can revive you) will know where to look for you. Extra bonus option: send a satellite with the same info into space on a long elliptic orbit that will not bring it back to Earth for a few hundred years. Emergency broadcast Similar to the time capsules, but more direct: If your containment facility is threatening to fail for some reason have it send out broadcasts with increasingly clear information. There is a definite risk you will attract the wrong kind of people this way, but rotting away is a certainty if nobody comes to revive you... or is it? The final contingency There is one way to ensure that someone other than you will be there at the time of your (intended) resurrection: You find someone with the medical and general skills to find help for you, who also has a fatal but not debilitating disease. That person will be frozen first, during your life and will be woken up first when the time is right or the machines are close to failure. They will be motivated to find help and if they do get cured, deeply in your debt, so the odds are good they will try hard to have you revived too. 

In summary, it would be just like the current system: Good for the rich and smart, bad for the poor, dumb and minorities (esp. because of #2). Jury selection would still determine the outcome of many cases. 

It can hunt down Somali pirates in rubber boats. If the Navy has any carriers, it will be a very big and expensive escort for a carrier. If not, it will be a very big target for enemy aircraft with long range anti-ship missiles. The modern navies that are actually prepared for battle (not just peacekeeping/support operations) will probably never face off at visual range anymore. They are built around the air power a carrier provides plus support and defense against the extremely dangerous long range anti-ship missiles now in service. Smaller, faster ships perform those tasks better than a single big battleship could. 

The body doesn't always die when the soul departs On rare occasions a soul departs the body before it dies. It could be that its life is complete, it is called to some other purpose or something so traumatic happens that the soul flees the body. Normally this is accompanied by a rapid decline in the body's health and then death. But on some occasions bodies survive, with only instincts and lower brain functions still controlling them. The light's on, but there's nobody home The uninhabited bodies are like zombies, but not quite. When hungry they will hunt something edible, when in pain they will flee or move to shelter. Without the lifeforce of the soul present, they start degenerating slowly even if they get enough food and avoid serious injuries. Unlike real zombies, they can bleed out or die of organ failure as they are still living in a biological sense. A new tenant As befits duality, souls also have an opposite, a kind of shadowy void that consumes all the things a soul lives for. A recently abandoned body can be entered and possessed by these spirits. They provide not only a new drive and intellect, but also a replacement for the soul's life force that keeps the body vigorous. This usually involves some way to take life energy from other beings. Depending on the nature of the spirit, you get a different kind of undead. Vampires, ghouls and the like obtain life energy from living blood and flesh, while the spirits that make mummies and skeletons drain life energy from their surroundings directly, so they can stay inactive for very long times.
