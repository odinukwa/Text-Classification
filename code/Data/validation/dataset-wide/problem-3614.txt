I had simiar issues until I discovered towel toe curls. Simply take off your shoes and socks and stand over a towel. Place the toes of your right foot on the towel and keep your heel on the floor. Use your toes to "curl" the towel back towards your body. It is like you are pulling the towel towards you using your toes. Do 50 reps to the right foot. Do 50 reps to the left foot. Do every day for 2 weeks and then every other as maintenance. Good luck. 

Definitely think you can go sub 25 minutes. The key with running is "Accumulated fitness". The more often you run and the more consistently (say 4 days a week for an entire year), the better you will become. So how do you get there? 1) Run often - minimum 4 days a week but slowly see if you can fit 5 or even 6 days a week into your schedule 2) Run consistently - run every week. Don't skip. 3) Add variety - vary your pace, vary your distance, add intervals, add distance, etc. 4) Extend your long run - try to get to 90 minutes by adding 5 minutes a week. Once you get to 90 minutes, try to make the run faster. One week make the last 5 minutes medium. Next week make the last 10 minutes medium, etc. Good luck! Let us know how you progress. P.S. I have worked with runners of all age groups. Anyone that has 1) desire to improve 2) discipline in training and diet and 3) even a small bit of athletic talent can improve. I have seen the following as good age goals for male "non-runners" under 30 - 21:00 30 - 40 - 24:00 40 - 50 - 25:00 50+ - 26:00 

JEFIT is a site and an Android app, mostly targeted for bodybuilders. It has a huge databases of exercises, almost all of them have illustrations and explanations about how to perform them (example). You can set your routine with the exercises you're doing, and log your workout each time you're at the gym, using the app. You can then track your progress easily and make sure you're getting stronger. The "social" part comes to play mostly in the routines database of the site, where anyone can share their routine for others to use. A video about the app can be found here. The site and app are free, although there's also a paid version of the app ($5) with a bit more options. 

When searching for the internet, or even talking to trainers, you will get an infinite number of routines. How should one choose a routine that is best for him? Is there any logic about it at all? I'm not addressing the exercises themselves but to the general diversion of muscle groups across days of the week. It looks like every mix is possible even when I'm looking for the most recommended routines. Of course most of the routines don't include any explanation other than "you will see the results in X months". The only logical thing about routines that I've heard is that it's better to do the Biceps exercises the same day you do the back, and Triceps on the shoulders + chest day, because the big muscle exercises also effort the according arm-muscle. This way you provide full rest for the Biceps/Triceps when it's not their workout day. Is this true, can I have more examples for this kind of sense in the vague world of routines? I'm working out since August and my results are not satisfying enough. I'm not looking for reasons of why I didn't grow up the way I wanted, but for a fresh routine to become more motivated and consistent. It's just so hard to pick one, and it seems so... consequences-full. I'm having 4 workout days a week. 

Do bird-dogs without lifting your arms. From the quadruped position, lift one leg straight back so it is parallel to the floor. Lower it back to the ground. Repeat with the other leg. For maximum results, place a dowel rod on across your lower back and do the exercises without the dowel falling off. Focuses on activating glutes without rotating hips. Can do 100 of these a day as this is neuromuscular (activating) and produces best results with maximum volume. Do 1 legged bridges but with your knee held to your chest. Lay on your back in a situp position. Pull one knee to your chest and hold it tightly in place. Squeeze your glutes (not hamstrings) and lift up into a bridge position so shoulder to knee is a straight line. Hold for 3 seconds. Lower. Repeat. This is a strengthening and activating exercise but it can cause strain on the lower back and hamstrings if not done correctly. Start with 1 set of 5 to each side. Increase up to 3 sets a day once you are ready. Once you can handle 3 sets a day, increase the reps by 5. For stretches, do the newspaper stretch. Hold for 3 minutes per side in order to lengthen the muscles. 30 seconds will make you feel better but more time is needed to actually lengthen the tissue. Good luck. 

Maybe just a touch lower, possibly where it starts turning into tendon. (Kind of hard to pinpoint, sorry.) I found this article talking about Rectus Femoris pain: $URL$ And it talks about how tight calves (specifically the soleus muscle) can cause you to overcompensate using your quads when doing squats. My calves are super tight and that includes the soleus so... probably onto something there. The only caveat is I'm not getting the knee pain as they describe it, or at the same times (they say it's worse at night.) What I do get is it will "ping" sometimes when standing up from a seated position, or climbing a stair. Between sets of squats my quads feel really, really tight almost like the muscle is clenching around that spot. That said, it doesn't seem to interfere with me actually doing the squats at all and I've been able to continue increasing the weight just fine. So what do I do about it? The article suggests a trigger point massage but it also seems to be selling a book for it so... Would just stretching more help? I've been considering some yoga between lifting days anyway. Should I rest the muscle longer to let it heal? The longest I've rested since noticing this is 3 days... I'd rather not skip too many workouts and lose momentum. 

Depends on your race distance. For races involving mostly aerobic energy, I think you are ok to stick to the simple 10-15 minute "get blood flowing" warm up. For races that involve more anerobic energy, try this 30 minutes before you race. 1) 10 minutes easy designed to get blood in the legs and the lungs. 2) 2-3 minutes a little below race intensity. 3) 30 seconds a little above race intensity. 4) 60 second easy jog. 5) a few strides If the race is less than a 1600, break the 2-3 minutes into 2 45 second intervals below race intensity with 30 second jog between. This gets blood to the desired areas, increases heart beat and also makes the brain adjust to faster than race pace so race pace seems easier. Good luck and good running. 

Great question. Progressive loading is the best strategy. In other words, start easy and increase load (difficulty, stress) as you gain strength. In my experience, it is best to train each pathway independently when possible, at least at first. Part of this reason is that lactate (anaerobic conditioning) interferes with the production of the aerobic enzyme. Would recommend aerobic to be the base of everything you do with anaerobic load to gradually increase. For example, in week 1 of training, perhaps only do 10-15% anaerobic work such as hill sprints or suicides. As you get closer to key competitions, gradually build the anaerobic portion up to maybe 50% of total work. The aerobic conditioning will always be the key though. As the season progresses, mixing the two and game scrimmages will allow for better development. It is crucial that hard days are followed by easy days as well. The Creatine Phosphate system can be developed at all times of the season. The key to ATP-CP development is the work (7-10 seconds max) and rest periods (3-5 minutes). 3 great ways to develop ATP-CP? 1) 60m accelerations to top speed. Turn around, walk back, wait 3 minutes before doing another. 2) Short hill sprints up a steep incline lasting no more than 7-10 seconds. Jog back, rest 3 minutes. 3) Deadlifts at 85% max with 2-3 reps. KEY TO NOT GAINING MASS is to rest 5 minutes between sets and no more than 2 or 3 sets. This exercise does wonders to also gain speed endurance. EVERY athlete can benefit from this regardless of sport and it can be performed 3 times a week. 

Small steps are better than bigger steps, less impact on your joints. It is best not to "jump" too high - always imagine as if you have a very low ceiling above you. Don't run on empty stomach (i.e. hungry) - you will get dizzy and you you will become tired too quickly. 

While most of the trainers train all of their body muscles, it is possible to skip a few muscles and focus on the rest. The best example is all of the guys who don't care about the legs and can end up looking like chickens. What I'm looking for is more example for this unevenness. How would a guy that only does chest-press but never chest-fly look like? How would a guy that only does back exercises but not shoulders look like? How would a guy that only does triceps exercises but not biceps look like? Is there anywhere photos of such cases? Although I'm curious about the subject in general, specifically I'm a bit more interested in the first example (chest-press without chest-flies) because that's my current workout due to itching shoulders. 

What recommendations (fact-based, if possible) do you have for pre-race to ensure optimal performance? Warm up is a given so no need to mention that. But what about nutrition, hydration, rest, etc. Assume a 10 am race. For example, consume 12-18oz of water 2 hours before a 5k to ensure hydration. Thanks. 

Shin splints are commonly caused by imbalances in muscles and supporting tissue. Try these for strengthening and mobility. 1) Alphabet with your feet focusing on rotating your ankles. 2) Towel toe curls or picking up change with your toes. 3) Heel raises. 4) Calf raises. More detail about the above can be found at Exercises to Prevent Shin Splints. For stretching, use these Calf Stretches. Do following a run for 3 minutes to a side in order to lengthen the calf muscles. Good luck. 

2 schools of thoughts on running the day before. 1) rest and save your glycogen stores for race day. 2) warm up and then run a few minutes at race pace. This could look like 10 minutes easy followed by 10 minutes of 30 seconds at 10k pace and 90 seconds jog. If you tapered the week before, I prefer 2. If you haven't cut back mileage, choose 1. Really don't think you can go wrong with either though. Eat before? Again, personal preference but choose something easily digestible and that you normally eat. Choose high carb, low protein, low fat. My personal favorite is a whole wheat bagel with a little bit of peanut butter about 2 hours before race time. Less time? Choose a spoon of honey. If the race is Sunday, too late to truly carbo load. You need a few days before. BUT a pasta dinner the night before would be beneficial provided it isnt loaded with cheese. Besides a carbo load probably isn't needed for a 10k. Oh and lifting, cross training, core, etc. - definitely skip if this is a goal race. Good luck and let us know what your new PR is!
