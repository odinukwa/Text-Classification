There is nothing obviously wrong with your handlebar setup. As long the shift and brake levers are easily accessible and you don't have to rotate your wrists or shift your hand laterally along the bar to reach them everything is OK Maybe I'd consider moving the levers slightly outwards (and I note there is a slight difference in position, the right hand one is slightly more inboard. Numb hands are a common problem. You don't have to ride with your fingers on the levers all the time. Try moving you hands around the bars and bar ends and flexing your fingers from time to time. 

Looks like the component in question is part of the levers and might be a barrel adjuster. BTW that style of lever units with the secondary levers accessible from the tops are known as 'suicide levers' around here. 

I personally would not ride that bike. The top tube is severely compromised now, it will get worse as cracks develop from the ends of the cuts. No-one plans to crash so you can't resolve to always ride it 'gently', You do not want to ride over a pothole or off a curb and have the top tube buckle up into your face, neck or chest. Your proposed fix of clamping a sheet of aluminium over the tube would not be sufficient, neither will JB weld. There is no safe solution for $30. Unfortunately, a proper welding job will probably cost more than you paid for the bike. 

The internet is replete with resources for bike assembly and maintenance. Park Tool Company has a particularly comprehensive set of articles and YouTube videos. Wheel axle obviously fits into the slots in the dropouts in the fork, and then the nuts are tightened on the axle. I imagine you need to know if the washers go inside or outside the dropout slots. Check out this article, look for a section titled "Solid Axle Systems", You can see that the tab washers go outside and fit into a hole in the dropout. 

I think the article you reference is in error. Obviously a longer crank arm gives more leverage, requiring less pedaling force to move the bike but requiring a faster pedaling cadence the pedal to moved faster around a larger circle (same angle/unit time, more distance/unit time). The rider's leg must therefore extend further and more quickly. 

(Weird mix of inch and mm measurements but oh well ..) You can run a quite wide tire in there. If you want to run tires in the 35-42mm range you should consider slightly wider rim than 19mm. If you search this site (or just google) you can find links to tire/rim size guides. 

I'd invest in a pair of bike shorts. Casual riders going short distances on big comfy saddles can get away with casual or regular sports clothing. You wonâ€™t be able to do that riding significant distance on a sports saddle. Bike shorts have padding, obviously, but are also constructed so there is no seam between rider and saddle. Regular sports shorts have a central crotch seam that is painful to ride on. The reason to not wear underwear under bike shorts is to not re-introduce seams between rider and saddle. 

The obvious mounting points for a chainguard are the chainring-spider bolts. There are many 'bash guards' available that mount like an extra chainring that are intended to protect the chainring teeth, but would probably do just a good a job of keeping pant legs away. Most are designed for small MTB chairings but larger ones seem to exist with road -bike BCDs. Try googling '50 tooth chainring bashguard'. 

Here's a version of you picture with labels on the parts I'm probably not using the correct names but these will work for this purpose. 

You may need to replace the brake pads, and the brake calipers and levers are very probably out of proper adjustment. As this is a safety issue, you should definitely have the brakes examined and adjusted by a bicycle repair mechanic. If you feel confident about making adjustments yourself, and have the necessary tools, there are a number of good resources that will show you how to accomplish the task properly. My favorite is the Park Tool Company YouTube Channel. They have a specific set of videos that deal with rim brake adjustment, including identifying the brake caliper types with links to the appropriate adjustment video. If the pads are heavily worn, or have hardened due to age you should replace them - pads are reasonably cheap. If braking is still not strong enough after making adjustments then you could consider getting a set of more expensive higher performance pads. 

If you mean that that the cassette can turn both forward and backwards without engaging the rear wheel hub; the freewheel or freehub is broken. Whether the freehub/wheel can be repaired, or whether the hub or possibly the whole wheel would need to be replaced depends on a number of things. Suggest you the bike to bike repair shop. 

Probably all that is needed is a re-adjustment of the front derailleur cable. The cable is pulled by the shifter lever to swing it outwards to the bigger rings, so slightly too much cable between the shifter and derailleur prevents the cage from being swung out enough to get to the biggest ring. There are many guides to derailleur adjustment out there. My favorite is available on the Park Tool Company YouTube channel (link below), but googling will yield several to choose from. Basic procedure is: To tighten the cable, find the front derailleur barrel adjuster, it will be at the shift lever if you have mountain bike shift levers or on the frame somewhere along the cable run if you have a road bike. Unscrew the barrel to tighten the cable, you may have to go several turns to get the cable tight enough. 

If looking at pre-build brand wheel, look for 'gravel', cyclocross (CX) or perhaps 29" MTB wheels (29" is same as 700c) as these will be built for more strength (at the expense of weight). Note that many wheels and hubs are now built for through-axles but come with quick release adapters. 

Looks like the problem is that both the main levers and secondary levers are too far away from the bar, so on the tops, hoods or drop you cannot reach them. If the levers have a reach adjustment, you can position them closer to the bars. Another possibility is to move the whole units further down the drops, which would move the secondary levers closer to the tops. 

Most racks are adjustable so that the rack can be fitted to a range of seat-stay lengths (more accurately, the distance between the eyelets the rack attaches to). I think this rack designed for a 28-29" wheel may be made to fit as the forward support arms can tilt down but the rack may be positions a little high. BTW, that rack is specifically for the Cube Bosch drive. The double-decker design is for holding a Bosch battery pack. 

If you are going to be commuting regularly so that you rack up some miles, in different kinds of weather, I think it's better to buy an aluminum frame bike and spend the saved money elsewhere. Upgrading the seatpost, saddle, and tires will make the bike plenty comfortable. Money can also be spent on more or better clothing - which will make a big difference in comfort if you are riding in unpleasant weather. Also, remember the cost of replacing tires, chains and cassettes. 

If the derailleur is swapped for another with the same actuation ratio the indexing will be unchanged. Shimano used an actuation ratio of 1.7 from 6 speed to 9 speed mountain and 10 speed road. (Source: Arts Cyclery Blog - Drivetrain Compatibility). So yes, the 8 speed Claris derailleur should work with the 6 speed shifter and 6 speed freewheel. 

Reading the current Specialized warranty policy I'd say you are covered. Only one way to find out for sure though - contact Specialized and ask to make a warranty claim. You will find out if they will cover it soon enough. Unless someone here has been through the same process recently it's hard to say how long it would take. 

It's a SRAM GXP in a threaded bottom bracket shell. Here's how I found out: The Canyon web page says just 'SRAM GXP', so I looked for some reviews thinking they might provide info about the BB. This Mountain Bike Review page has a picture that clearly shows the BB area, and you can see the bearing is an external type, not a press fit type.
