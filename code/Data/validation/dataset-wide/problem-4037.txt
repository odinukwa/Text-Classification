I sympathize with your case. A 2.1 is really not bad. You shouldn't denigrate yourself and view your peripatetic interests as requiring redemption. Taking on a big unsolved problem without guidance or the background of a PhD student seems doomed to fail. Locking yourself in a library with all the world's books is unlikely to produce anything of merit. I have never heard of a case of a student producing something of "intriguing/charming/advanced" and using that to gain graduate admission. The romantic, amateur heroic view of math is largely bunk as pointed out by Terry Tao. There is still hope. I know that undergraduate research is less common in the UK, but I would expect that if you email lots of professors in areas of interest to you and basically offer yourself as cheap or free labor (undergrad student level), there is a good chance that you'll be taken on as an unofficial research student by someone. I know many cases of people in math and science using this sort of informal contact to start research projects that eventually develop into PhD positions. Making yourself known to a tenured professor who can write you a strong recommendation is probably enough to get you a PhD position somewhere (in the US, UK or Europe). It is unlikely that claiming to solve a big problem or do research on your own is going to be trusted by graduate committees. You need recommendations from people trusted in the academic community. There are MO users who have taken a decade or more off from education and successfully started PhD positions at Princeton and other top research institues. Good luck. 

Note that $a\precsim b$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $r\in A$ such that $\|a-rbr^*\|\leq\varepsilon$. Assume that $a\precsim b\precsim c$. To show that $a\precsim c$, let $\varepsilon>0$. First, using that $a\precsim b$, choose $r\in A$ such that $\|a-rbr^*\|\leq\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}$. We may assume that $r\neq 0$. Next, using that $b\precsim c$, choose $s\in A$ such that $\|b-scs^*\|\leq \tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}\|r\|^{-2}$. Then $$ \|a-rsc(rs)^*\| \leq \|a-rbr^*\| + \|rbr^*-rsc(rs)^*\| \\ \leq \tfrac{\varepsilon}{2} + \|r(b-scs^*)r^*\| \\ \leq \tfrac{\varepsilon}{2} + \|r\| \|b-scs^*\| \|r^*\| \leq \varepsilon. $$ 

The answer is `No'. Example: Let $A$ be any C*-algebra that is not finitely generated as a C*-algebra. For example, let $A=C(X)$ for a compact, metric space $X$ that has infinite covering dimension, such as the Hilbert cube. Since $A$ is a C*-algebra, the family $\mathfrak{A}=\{A\}$, consisting just of $A$ itself, is a trivial exhausting, directed family of complete subalgebras. However, there is another such family: For a subset $F$ of $A$, let $C^*(F)$ denote the sub-C*-algebra generated by $F$. Consider the family $$ \mathfrak{B} = \{ C^*(F) \colon F \text{ finite subset of } A\}. $$ It is easy to check that $\mathfrak{B}$ is an exhausting, upward directed family of complete subalgebras of $A$. However, since $A$ itself is not finitely generated, the subalgebra $A$ does not belong to the family $\mathfrak{B}$. Now, consider the identity map $A\to A$, which is clearly a c.p.c. order zero map. When the source is equipped with the family $\mathfrak{A}$ and the target is equipped with the family $\mathfrak{B}$, then the OP's question has a negative answer. Explanation A local C*-algebra is only assumed to have an exhausting, directed family of complete subalgebras. But this family is not part of the structure of the local C*-algebra. Indeed, there may be different (inequivalent) such families for the same local C*-algebra, as the above example shows. A different (and maybe better) way to think of local C*-algebras is as follows. Given a pre-C*-algebra $A$, consider the embedding into its completion $\overline{A}$. Then $A$ is a local C*-algebra if and only if for each finite subset $F$ of $A$, the C*-algebra $C^*(F)$ (generated in $\overline{A}$) is contained in $A$. This shows that every local C*-algebra has a canonical exhausting, directed family of complete subalgebras, namely the collection of all finitely generated sub-C*-algebras. It seems plausible that the structure theory for c.p.c. order zero maps between C*-algebra (as developed by Winter and Zacharias), can be extended to the context of local C*-algebras to show the following: Let $A$ and $B$ be local C*-algebras, and let $\varphi\colon A\to B$ be a c.p.c. order zero map. Let $F$ be a finite subset of $A$. Then there exists a finite subset $G$ of $B$ (presumably of cardinality at most one more than that of $F$) such that the image of the C*-algebra $C^*(F)$ under $\varphi$ is contained in the C*-algebra $C^*(G)$. 

Cosheaves are indeed mysterious gadgets. On the one hand, cosheaves are everywhere, but on the other hand, someone used to thinking sheaf-theoretically may have some problems. I am very close to finishing an exposition on cosheaves, but need another week or so to put it on the arxiv. Bredon's book on sheaf theory has the most complete reference on cosheaves, so you might look there if you like. AS you may know, pre-cosheaves are just covariant functors $\hat{F}:\mathrm{Open}(X)\to\mathcal{D}$ where $\mathcal{D}$ is some "data category" like Vect, Ab, or what have you. Cosheaves send covers (closed under intersection) to colimits and different covers of the same open set get sent to isomorphic colimits. The Mayer-Vietoris axiom is a good way of thinking about cosheaves and since homology commutes with direct limits, one can see that $H_0(-,k)$ is always a cosheaf. In particular, $H_0(-,\mathcal{L})$ is a cosheaf whenever $\mathcal{L}$ is a local system. As you observed, since cosheaves are fundamentally colimit-y, they have left-derived functors rather than right-derived ones. Thus the answer to (1) is yes. In regards to (2), one must be careful. I believe the answer is yes, but allow me to pontificate on the problem. Filtered limits and finite colimits do not commute in most categories like Ab, Vect, or Set. This has serious ramifications through the theory of cosheaves. For example, it is not necessarily true that a sequence of cosheaves is exact iff it is exact on costalks. Here costalks are defined using (filtered) inverse limits rather than direct ones. Another very serious consequence is that Grothendieck's sheafification procedure cannot be dualized to give cosheafification. Thus the usual phrase "let blah by the cosheaf associated to the pre-cosheaf blah" is not necessarily well-founded because it is unclear how to cosheafify! People have solved this problem in the past by working with pro-objects (which corrects for this "filtered limits not commuting with finite colimits" asymmetry) and then they use Grothendieck's construction. However, for abstract categorical reasons one can check that cosheafification does exist for data categories like Vect (i have worked out a proof and haven't found in the literature anyone who claims to have proved this), we just don't have an explicit construction. That said, the usual description of the left-derived functor of the push-forward should still hold. On the other hand, if one works in the constructible setting, one can get the statements you would like. In particular, it is true that cosheaves constructible with respect to a cell structure are derived equivalent to sheaves constructible with respect to the same cell structure. I discovered independently my own proof, only to find that at least two other people have proved this before. However, in my opinion, the equivalence is the "correct" form of Verdier duality. A larger and updated exposition should be available soon. 

Given a Banach space $X$, we consider the space $B(X^*)$ of bounded, linear operators on $X^*$ with the weak*-topology from its canonical predual $B(X^*)_*=X^*\hat{\otimes}X$. What is $\overline{F(X^*)}^{wk*}$, the weak*-closure of the finite rank operators on $X^*$? Since this is rather vague, here are some concrete questions: 

Considering $B(X)$ as a subalgebra of $B(X^*)$ in the usual way, we may ask related questions in connection with $F(X)$ and $K(X)$. The principle of local reflexivity implies $\overline{F(X)}^{wk*}=\overline{F(X^*)}^{wk*}$ in $B(X^*)$. However, it is not clear to me if we always have $\overline{K(X)}^{wk*}=\overline{K(X^*)}^{wk*}$ (I guess not). Therefore, we may also ask: 

Since $A(G)$ is closed under passing to complex conjugation, a positive answer to Question 1 would imply a positve answer to Question 2. Additionally, if $f,|f|\in A(G)$, is there a relation between the norms of $f$ and $|f|$ in $A(G)$? 

There are lots of possible answers to your question, but maybe here are some ideas. They aren't papers, but good projects. 

So group homomorphisms $\pi_{1}(\Sigma)\to U(1)$ correspond on the nose with first cohomology of the $\Sigma$ with coefficients in $U(1)$. EDIT: To be accurate the Hatcher result shows we have an injection of group homomorphisms into homotopy classes of maps. Does anyone know if every homotopy class of maps is realized by a group homomorphism? What bothers me is what comes next. Now replace $U(1)$ with $G$ - any compact simply connected Lie group, take $G=SU(n)$ for example. Now Atiyah claims that $H^1(\Sigma,G)$ parametrizes conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $\pi_{1}(\Sigma)\to G$. Now if the fundamental group or the Lie group were abelian this would be the same statement, but higher genus Riemann surfaces (genus greater than 1) have non-abelian fundamental groups and Atiyah is looking specifically at non-abelian $G$. Also, it seems that the statement of Brown Representability requires abelian coefficient groups, so I am stuck. Does anyone know a clean way of proving Atiyah's claim? EDIT2: I renamed the question to draw in the "right" people. I think the answer has to do with the fact that principal G-bundles over a Riemann surface are determined by maps of $\pi_1(\Sigma)\to G$ (can someone explain why?). This is related to local systems and/or flat connections, which I don't understand well. Thanks! 

Is every group isomorphic to an inductive colimit (that is, directed colimit, also called inductive limit, or directed limit) of free groups? I guess, the answer is no. In that case: Is there a characterization of the groups that are isomorphic to inductive colimits of free groups? 

Given a countable group $G$ with the AP, and an normal, amenable subgroup $N$ of $G$, does $G/N$ have the AP? In particular, does there exist a group $G$ with the AP and a surjective group homomorphism $\varphi\colon G\to\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$ such that the kernel of $\varphi$ is amenable? Background: Let $G$ be a locally compact group. We use $A(G)$ to denote the Fourier algebra of $G$, and we let $M_0A(G)$ denote the space of completely bounded multipliers on $A(G)$, equipped with completely bounded norm. Then $M_0A(G)$ has a natural weak*-topology and we say that $G$ has the Approximation Property (or AP, for short), if there is a net in $A(G)$ that converges to the constant function $1$ in the weak*-toplogy of $M_0A(G)$. This is Definition 1.1 in the following paper by Haagerup and Kraus: Trans. AMS: Approximation properties for group C*-algebras and group von Neumann algebras. Motivation: An open problem in abstract harmonic analysis asks whether given a locally compact group $G$ and $p\in[1,\infty)$, the algebra $PM_p(G)$ of $p$-pseudomeasures on $G$ coincides with the algebra $CV_p(G)$ of $p$-convolvers on $G$. The answer is "yes" for $p=2$, in which case $CV_2(G)=PM_2(G)$ is the group von Neumann algebra of $G$. A positive answer to this problem for $p\neq 2$ is known for groups with the AP, as shown in the following article of Daws and Spronk: arXiv: The approximation property implies that convolvers are pseudo-measures. (For definitions of $PM_p(G)$ and $CV_p(G)$ we refer to the above paper.) Now, given a locally compact group $G$ and a closed, amenable subgroup $N$ of $G$, we have by the above result that $PM_p(G)=CV_p(G)$. In general, it is known that $PM_p(G)\subset CV_p(G)$. The goal would be to show that the quotient map $Q\colon G\to G/N$ induces a surjective map $CV_p(G)\to CV_p(G/N)$. One could then try to deduce that $PM_p(G/N)=CV_p(G/N)$, thus extending the result of Daws and Spronk to groups that are quotients of groups with the AP by amenable subgroups. However, this is only interesting if this class of groups is actually larger than the groups with AP. 

I was inspired by the following algebraic topology orals question: "Is $S^1$ the loop space of another space?" This is easy to see if you recognize that $S^1$ is a $K(\mathbb{Z},1)$, and the loop space of any $K(G,n)$ is a $K(G,n-1)$. I then also remembered that the loop space functor is a functor from pointed topological spaces and continuous maps to the category of H-spaces and continuous homomorphisms. H-spaces being topological spaces that satisfy the axioms of a group up to homotopy (see Spanier, Chapter 1, Section 5). I have three questions: 

This question is inspired by a statement of Atiyah's in "Geometry and Physics of Knots" on page 24 (chapter 3 - Non-abelian moduli spaces). Here he says that for a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ the first cohomology $H^1(\Sigma,U(1))$, where $U(1)$ is just complex numbers of norm 1, parametrizes homomorphisms $$\pi_{1}(\Sigma)\to U(1).$$ This is fine by me, after all by Brown Representability we know $$H^1(\Sigma,G)\cong [\Sigma,BG]=[B\pi_{1}\Sigma,BG]$$ since we know that Riemann surfaces are $K(\pi_{1},1)$s. We then use the handy fact from Hatcher Prop. 1B.9 (pg 90) that shows that... 

Edit 03.03.2015: Logical error in question fixed. The section $\sigma$ may depend on the compact subset $K$. 

If $A$ is semiprojective (the C*-analog of an absolute neighborhood retract, ANR), then your question also has a positive answer. The class of semiprojective C*-algebras includes also many non-commutative C*-algebras (e.g. all finite-dimensional algebras, Cuntz algebras). More precisely, let $A$ be a semiprojective C*-algebra and let $B$ be any C*-algebra. Let $D=C([0,1],B)$ and consider the surjective homomorphism $\pi = ev_0\oplus ev_1\colon D\to B\oplus B$. Given any homomorphism $f\colon A\to B$, consider the homomorphism $f\oplus f\colon a\mapsto (f(a),f(a)) \in B\oplus B$. This has an obvious lift to a homomorphism $\alpha\colon A\to D$ such that $f\oplus f=\pi\circ\alpha$. By Theorem 4.1 in Blackadar, "The homotopy lifting property for semiprojective C*-algebras", homomorphisms from semiprojective C*-algebras can be lifted if they are close enough to a liftable homomorphism. Let $g\colon A\to B$ be a homomorphism close to $f$. Then $f\oplus g$ is close to $f\oplus f$. Since the latter can be lifted to a homomorphism to $D$, so can $f\oplus g$. But this implies that $f$ is homotopic to $g$. 

I'm not sure if this answer provides you with the universal property that you desire, but there is such a category that unifies these concepts that you are after. Cohen, Jones and Segal introduced a concept known as the "Flow Category" in the paper Morse Theory and Classifying Spaces, which associates to any manifold with a Morse Function a category whose objects are the critical points of the Morse function and whose morphisms are the gradient trajectories of some gradient-like vector field. Here is the reference: $URL$ You can get the paper on Ralph Cohen's page if you don't have university access: $URL$ Recall that Morse Theory was invented by Marston Morse to study geodesics on manifolds. Geodesics correspond precisely to critical points of the Energy functional. I imagine that any variational problem fits into this framework. As a word of caution, understanding the space of gradient trajectories lies at the heart of Floer Theory, so if you want to understand Morse Theory on infinite dimensional spaces, prepared to get your hands dirty with some serious analysis. Comment if you want more references. Also, most of the above article is concerned with proving a very elegant result about the classifying space of this category for certain situations. It is very slick! 

Originally I had written: "We know that $B(X)$ is always weak*-dense in $B(X^*)$. (In general, this is weaker then being $1$-norming.) Translating back to $\alpha$, this means that $\alpha$ is always injective." However, as pointed out by Bill Johnson below, not even that is the case. So the answer to my question is a big "NO". If $X$ is reflexive, then $\beta$ is surjective, and so $\alpha$ is isometric. (This can also be seen more directly.) If $X$ has the metric approximation property, then already the unit ball of $F(X)$, the finite rank operators on $X$, is weak*-dense in the unit ball of $B(X^*)$. Thus, also in this case, $\alpha$ is isometric.
