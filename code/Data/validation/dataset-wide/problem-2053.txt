Part of the whole Pay and Benefits package is the benefits... how can you seriously begin negotiating for your total compensation without knowing the rest of the package? Once they give you a firm, written, offer letter, you'd be scheduled for an HR meeting (assuming medium to large company) and receive the rest of the P&B package details, at which point you can start salary negotiations. In my experience (as an employee of a company contracted to the US government), a verbal offer is simply one side asking the other if they would like to come to work. There is nothing binding on either side of a verbal conversation. (In fact, peruse this site for all of the questions that start with something like "I got an offer of $X and now I'm being cheated..."). The verbal part may, if you choose, also give a (very) general outline of your salary levels. I would not say during a verbal meeting, I will work for 58k per year. I might say I would be interested in starting negotiations in the 50's, but anything serious would have to wait until I see the entire benefits package. What giving a ball-park range does it enable you to ensure you're not thinking of $65 an hour and them $20. However, please know that I strive to not even give that much information in the verbal part. There is just too much possibility that you'll say $65 and they were thinking $100. Know your field, know your capabilities, know the economy. Take what you're making now and adjust it. Save the actual salary discussion for the HR meeting you'll get after your written offer. For now, what you've told them is ... perfect. 

So my answer is going to be short, without citations, and I'm sorry about that. Are you employed now? If so, ask them. Go to your HR department, to whomever interviewed you, and ask if they considered your accomplishment at all, and if so, how. If they disregarded it, or if they found themselves wondering why it was there, perhaps it's time now to take it out. If, however, it started some conversation during interview, then unless it could be replaced with more pertinent job related information, it's find as an accomplishment. as long as it is relevant to today. Are you still Scouting? Are you a leader? 

It depends. Do you work in a "blue collar" shop? Older co-workers (40's+)? We grew up (I'm 51) learning how to "tell time" the "old fashioned way" where it is truly easier for me to tell the general time by the hands' positioning on the dial. (This next paragraph is partly tongue in cheek, partly exasperation, and partly truth) Kid's these days! Sheesh. Digital this, computer that, automatic the other. I don't have statistics at hand, but I can safely presume, at least in the world in which I live (Northern Virginia, USA) that the twenty-somethings, millennial, whatever you may, were never taught to tell time. They read the numbers on the digital clock and mentally process that into the time of day. So, you might be seeing proof of generational gap. On the other hand ... If you are working in a less "blue collar" shop, perhaps even high end, maybe finance, or well, how do I put this. I am a contractor for a very large multinational firm. I am contracted by my company to the government in a job I cannot talk about. Those of us who work at the customer site are the "worker bees". Then we have our divisional corporate offices. People who work there, at the headquarters buildings are this set of people. They may be doing the exact job as I am, but they are, by dint of where they work, more concerned with ... lets say image. Dress nicer. Be ready to be seen by the upper management. OK, now we are with the people who care less about what they learned, and more about image. You'll see nicer accessories. Silk ties, vice cotton or whatever (I don't wear one.) I'll wear a wedding ring, they'll wear maybe class rings as well. My watch would be an analog Timex ($20-30). They might wear a nicer watch (I don't know brands, but $100ish). They might also consider wearing analog so as not to "look" like a ... well ... kid. Millennial. Whatever. Then you have the offices where looks matter. That person will know exactly what he wants to wear, and buy it. $1000 or $10,000. It will be stylish, expensive and present exactly the look he wants to present. This will be your Senior VP, or CEO. Bringing it back down and around to you. If everyone is wearing analog, is everyone slightly older than you? If so, don't worry, it's what they know. Do you want to be comfortable, buy and wear what you know. Do you want to completely 'fit in'? Buy and wear (and learn to use) what everyone else does. Does it really really matter? Probably not. You're not going to get fired for wearing the wrong watch. (Unless there are policies, etc) Now for concrete advice. Find a watch that fits well on your wrist, both in looks and feel; one that is not dirt cheap, but is a minor percentage of your monthly salary. Find one that fits these criteria and has both analog dials and a digital display. read what is comfortable for you and know you have done your best to fit in with them as well. 

It would be my guess, they are not intentionally attempting to 'fool' potential employees. They are ensuring you know your stuff. Regardless of whatever their need for you is right now, they want to ensure that if they are employing a coder then that is what they get. If all they needed at this moment was a web designer (please ... all web designers... I know your job is not 'easy' don't kill me for this next line of thought), then what would happen if they interviewed someone with the stance that "right now we need an HTML 5 web site designer" so right now that's what we'll get? For the job necessary at the moment, they will get exactly that. Once the page is up and it looks good and everything works, well they're not going to be forever satisfied. So, now they need some PHP code, perhaps a java module. Maybe some Perl coding as well. They go to their newly hired HTML 5 expert and say we need this and that, and the employee now says OK, I'll need 6 months and four classes to learn it to get up to speed. The company can spend the time and training money and advance the knowledge of the employee, for sure. They can also fire the employee and hire a new person with the required skills. (Depending on where this is happening, it may be more or less difficult mind you.). I am in Virginia, USA. This is an at-will employment state. The company could let the person go, because they no longer meet the skills required, and there would be little to no legal ramifications, beyond perhaps unemployment. OR They could hire a person with the exact skill-sets needed plus all the additional knowledge needed to stay current for the foreseeable future as well. So what should you do now Ask for a meeting with your manager/boss. Be honest and up front with him or her. Let them know that after the battery of testing that occurred during the hiring process you thought X while the reality is Y. You are currently kind of unhappy with the situation, as you feel you will quickly lose skills. Ask him/her what the plans are both near-term and long-term, for the software, the project and the company. This will show you have a concern about your own skills, but also that you are thinking to the future, both of yourself AND the company. For all you know, there may be projects just around the corner which will amaze you. After that meeting, see how you feel. If you are still very much concerned, then re-evaluate your own career goals and hey, maybe it's time to refresh your CV and continue the job search. If that is true, you have one advantage over many other people right now.... you already have a job!
