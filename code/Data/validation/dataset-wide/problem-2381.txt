Isn't the whole point of such an exercise to remind us that we should be mindful, at all times? Though I am a Vajrayana practitioner, I sat for years at the Cambridge insight meditation Center. Some teachers say that concentrating with such focus is no longer meditation. 

I first was interested in Buddhism at the age of 15, but actually started meditating that year with Hindu yogis from India. For some time, I practiced in a Japanese school of Buddhism but after seven years but I realized I had joined a cult. That was very disappointing. Not only did they never meditate, but their practice consisted solely of chanting one mantra. When I asked about emptiness, for example, they would just tell me that this was not important. Later I found myself attending the Zen Center in my community, and then I would periodically attend the insight meditation Center in my city. The one day I met a Tibetan teacher and I realized that this was my path. There is a somewhat mystical or maybe even silly belief in the Dharma community that one finds oneself exactly where one should be. I have found that many Catholics and Jews seem to enjoy the Tibetan practices, probably because of the ritualistic aspects. Who knows. It is not necessary to know everything about each school, for example, because the basics of Buddhism are 1, to be compassionate and loving towards all sentint and beings, and 2, a belief in awakening: that is to say that we can recognize our own true nature, the awakened state, or enlightenment. Whichever path you choose, all you have to do is walk that path and practice. Some individuals are more cerebral, and enjoy reading, deliberating philosophy, and other "academic" endeavors, and they may find themselves enrolled in a Tibetan University for 12 years, in order for them to obtain the equivalent to a doctoral degree, called a GESHE. As such,you may meet a Tibetan teacher who will be referred to as "Geshe-la," an honorific title which denotes that he has received a PhD in Tibetan studies. most monks and nuns in University, at least in the Tibetan system, will study for many years. I wish you the best in your search for awakening. 

Every volitional action of individuals, save those of Buddhas and Arahants, is called Karma. The exception made in their case is because they are delivered from both good and evil; they have eradicated ignorance and craving, the roots of Karma. According to the Niyama Dharmas, the 2nd which is "Bija Niyama" does indicate a determinant force which is inherited by the parents. But in my opinion, it is not a hypothetical idea that what our parents do right here right now or in the far away past, affects us today in the present! No it does not. It is more about what we inherit - by that I mean our genetical inheritance. And that is predetermined by our own Karma : which is the 3rd Niyama Dharma - "Karma Niyama". Our actions bear results. And they are partly what we inherit in a next existence. So the answer goes as such All that we experience begins with thought. Our words and deeds spring from thought. If we speak or act with evil thoughts, unpleasant circumstances and experiences inevitably result. So have pure thoughts, and the results will be pure! Nothing to worry about our parents' deeds! 

Consider a situation (just a silly example) like this: Suppose I'm walking on a road or grass field, and I know there are living beings like ants and other insects lying down on the surface, but I don't have any intention to kill any being while I walk there to reach my destination. But, as I'm walking, consequently, many little beings are killed by me by stomping on them, though I don't have intention to do so. Buddhism says that only an action done with intention will account as a Karma that will affect us accordingly.. Referring to this and the situation I gave for example, does it mean that the killing of insects without intention (though I know I'm going to kill them) isn't a bad Karma? Will I not face any effect due to that action I did unintentionally, but KNOWINGLY? If that's the case, why can't I rob a house and say that I just did it to quench my starving stomach, not to hurt anyone? Isn't the consequence of doing an unintentional action considered as a seed that can affect oneself? Why? If you say I'm wrong, then how is Karma in Buddhism different from that of Jainism, where every action is a Karma? 

But when we think even deeper, if both mind and body are 'sankhara', then who is the 'being' within our minds, who travels through this eternity of existence? This 'being' that some refer simply (and quite wrongly) as an 'Āthma' or in other ways as 'existence'? If 'Āthma' or 'existence' is Sankhara, then how does it endlessly exist? Sure it changes from one existence to another, but it is endlessly existing , which contradicts the nature of 'Sankhara' itself, making 'our existence' immortal. It is like a man travelling from house to house. The house breaks down, but the man is eternally travelling. Who is this man, and how is he eternally travelling, is he is also 'Sankhara'? Shouldn't he also end at some point or the other? In this analogy, the man is the 'existence', and the house symbolizes our body and mind. I know this is very confusing material, but I consider this site a realm filled with knowledgeable beings. I would find myself very happy to find any number of meaningful replies. Thankyou!!! 

As asked in the question, what are the characteristics by which a thing is classified as 'living being' or 'non-living' ? How is a lifeform defined in Buddhism, I mean, like how humans consider themselves as living beings due to various facts such as: their experience in this world due to consciousness, their actions (kamma), etc. If lifeform is defined as something that has consciousness and capable of producing kamma, what things are concious? Is a plant a living being/conscious? Is a stone living being/conscious? Is the universe conscious? Is everything a lifeform in some way? Is rebirth possible only as a lifeform? (I mean, by rebirth, just a transfer of consciousness/experience subject to different conditions. Please correct me if I'm wrong) Can our next rebirth be as a stone/whatever, other than the 5 predefined possibilities (human, god, ghost, animal, hell) in Buddhism? I'd be glad if all the questions are addressed :) 

Edit: I asked this NOT because I wanted help from god or believed in god. I asked this because, Buddha said that there are heavenly beings (gods) with powers, but are themselves mortal too.. So, I just wanted to know, why Buddhists pray to those gods (I've seen many Buddhists praying to god, not all Buddhists). Is that even fruitful?
