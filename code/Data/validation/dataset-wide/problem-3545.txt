Are you looking for an order for these things? I just stopped being a student but I would be inclined to do 

Situps are not the only exercise that can strengthen your core. Other exercises include planks, bicycles, crunches, and inverse crunches. I am not sure your fitness levels but each of these would help you get to a place where you could do a full sit-up. Yoga is also a good way to improve core strength and flexibility as most of the forms work the core. It may also help to get into some good cardio shape as walking and running inherently work the core. You can try something like MBT shoes (not sure how well these work but they purport to help) that would further stimulate your core during these activities. Either way most physical activity involves your car so as you improve your general fitness your core will get better. If you are looking for form for these exercises either look at YouTube or an app such as NTC. 

Lunges and balance are good ideas but I would particularly consider exercises that focus on core and legs. Burpees and updowns are particularly good because they improve leg explosion and engage the core pretty heavily while also working on smaller muscles that increase balance. Burpees will also help with shoulders to accelerate as a racer out of the gate. If you want to include weights deadlifts are also helpful in that they engage the back as well as the core. Really all the classic leg lifts will help. I've also seen a lot of ski workouts that include weight sleds or drag shoots. One big thing to consider would be any exercise that engages your core by throwing off your balance. Bosu exercises come to mind because you constantly have to be maintaining your balance. Bosu stepovers would be particularly good in this case. 

So planks may be good or bad for rest days but it depends on what type of core exercises you do on your workout days. Core is a particularly hard exercise to do more than flex as part of a workout. As a result it can be OK to do core multiple days in a row (but probably shouldn't be every day.) What I would recommend is doing yoga which will dynamically support the core but will also support active recovery and flexibility. 

Bodyweight exercises are in general a good way to go. If you don't want to leave the house or buy expensive equipment then look into plans like Under Armour, Nike Training Club, or Freeletics. Running and biking are great ways to keep up your cardio shape. Even just walking can help you keep in reasonably good shape. At then end of the day look around for a set of exercises or equipment that works for you. The hardest part of any workout plan is the first step: starting it. I'd just recommend a vetted and researched program. Don't go to crazy on equipment or anything until you've committed to something you want to do and then you can decide what to shell out on. 

Nike Training Club and Freeletics both include stretching as part of lifting. I think Under Armour has an app as well. I would recommend including dynamic stretching as a warmup and static stretching as a cool down. A quick google search will give you options for both. For those in particular I would recommend overhead tricep stretch where you put your elbow above your head and use your other arm to pull it toward the opposite shoulder. Also a chest stretch where you put one arm extended against a wall and rotate your body away. 

So one suggestion I would have is trying bone conduction headphones. I have a pair I use for working out and they stay on well. They are also sweat resistant. I am not gonna recommend a specific pair cause that would be kinda against the stack exchange network protocol. The issues I would say with bone conduction is that you can still hear everything around you. This is a double edged sword. I like that for biking, running, and traveling because I have full situational awareness. The bad news is you can hear everything around you unlike most headphones. 

In general this seems like good progress for burpees. I generally take everything people say about their results on the internet with a grain of salt. Burpees are a particularly problematic one because people have different definitions of what good form is. I doubt anyone other than the highest level of athletes could easily do 100 burpees without significant preparation. The idea behind an exercise like burpees is that they work out the whole body including core, legs, and shoulders as well as good cardio without too great an impact on joints. As a result they tend to be difficult for any athlete regardless of fitness level. All bodyweight exercises are going to continue to be difficult because as you gain muscle you will weigh more. With burpees, like any other exercise, you will have large initial gains and then gains will slowly increase. All I can say is keep working on it and make sure you have sufficient protein intake and calorie intake. 

I am an early 20s fairly active person and volunteer firefighter. I am looking to increase strength and speed as an amateur athlete and be a more effective fireman. I have been lifting for 6 years now and I am now about 83 kg at 1.83m and can squat 225x3x10 comfortably and bench 185x3x10 comfortably as well. I am currently in a position where anything other than a home gym would be highly inconvenient. Would the TRX system be an effective way to meet these goals? 

Given your back issues and your doctors advice I'd be hesitant to try most traditional lifting programs. Instead you may want to look at calisthenics due to the decreased risk and lessened strain on the skeleton and joints. There are a lot of good bodyweight workout plans out there and in head to heads they can produce similar results strength wise particularly if you're just looking to build muscle to be in shape and not necessarily to look huge. 

So you're in a cool position that you can eat a lot and try to gain the weight. As long as you keep exercising may as well take advantage of it and eat some stuff that tastes good. I don't see anything that says you have any non nut dietary restrictions so look at getting some steaks. If you can find reasonably priced ones then you will get a pretty dense amount of protein. I also personally tend to eat the fat on a steak while it is calorically dense and high in cholesterol if you are exercising consistently and want to gain the weight it is high in oils that will help you gain. A personal favorite for post workout is tuna fish. It is very high in protein equivalent to most shakes etc. Try making a bowl of easy mac or something similar mixing in tuna (I add salsa as well.) Its high calorie and high protein so will help you gain weight. Oatmeal can also be good for that. A third thing to try would be drink more milk. Chocolate milk has the optimal ratio of protein and carbs for post workout and is a staple of the USOC's recommended post workout regimen. I hope this helped.
