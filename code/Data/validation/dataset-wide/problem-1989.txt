I've been freelancing for a former colleague of mine who has started a new business. I've known the colleague about 4 years professionally, and he reached out to me to join his business as an employee. The new company is made of mostly ex-colleagues of his so far. He has given me a full time offer contingent on the business reaching its next funding goal, likely in 1-2 months. The problem is the salary offer is about 15-25% lower than my previous job, depending on if I ignore the bonus factor. My previous salary was generous overall. I'm curious how I might negotiate this to a more reasonable number? At the very least I'd like not to take a paycut from my previous base salary. I've seen that the company is doing well so far, and the next funding will solidify it, so I don't think they are hurting for cash. The unique factor seems to be that he specifically sought me out for the position based on my unique skillset to offer within the new company, I'm the lead. I've got 10 years experience in what I do, and have created similar things to what they want in past, with lots of transferable knowledge/tools. I plan to use the next 2 months to deliver amazing results, such that he wouldn't want anyone else for the role. No one better, and no one new either. What is the best approach at getting the 15-25% more I expect? I feel like if I just stated the minimal 15% higher, it would be compromised down to somewhere lower. And if I stated "I was thinking 15-25% higher than this number", 15% is the best that would be possible. If I went high at 25% more, it might be considered absurd. At the same time, I'm interested in continuing this role, so he may know I'm not going to walk away from the low offer. I've been interviewing elsewhere with no offers yet, perhaps I play-up other company's interest? 

I am on unemployment, and in the UK, which means I cannot turn down an offer of employment without sufficient cause or my benefits will stop. I had a job offer made last week via a recruitment agency. I was told, with great enthusiasm, that their client wanted me to start asap. Although my enthusiasm for the role was more lukewarm, I accepted. I was due to start on Monday 5th. It did not happen and its a strong possibility their second start date, Monday 12th, is going to pass without me starting. They have now decided they want paperwork from me for background checks that does not and never existed. It requires the unemployment agency to send me a custom letter which will not arrive until end of next week. I have been unable to find an alternative they will accept. I have continued my job search while all this has been pending and now hearing about interviews next week. I've accepted but feel uncomfortable because if I then withdraw (due to starting), I'm burning my bridges with several companies over a lukewarm job offer. So, here's the first part of my question. When would be appropriate to withdraw from this offer? The second part relates to how I would withdraw. I have no proof but believe it is the company not the agency which is causing the issue. The agency also manages recruitment for other clients doing similar work to the job offer. If I am to withdraw then if at all possible, I'd want to be able to then be considered by them for other roles that they have to offer. Is there even a way to achieve that? Update - The lukewarm job offer has turned around and said I can start on Monday after all leaving me with a very tough decision to make and only a couple of hours to do so. I've never disliked the idea of a job so much before I started it but I wonder how much of this is down to new job anxiety. 

I've got about 15 years experience in software engineering with a great deal of experience working with a variety of companies. I've worked with startups especially in the past 6 years, and recently have encountered something odd in salary talks when engaging a new company. These are new small startups with 5-7 ppl, usually 2 cofounders and about 4 dev capacity people. They are well funded at this point usually. What I've encountered is these cofounders assume all tech people on the team will be paid the same salary. This might work if everyone has the same experience or role but often I'm sought because of my experience and ability to deliver and then assumed to be paid the same generic rate as someone 10 years my junior professionally. Or, the founders think they are being generous but fair by not paying anyone more or negotiating one or another. That they are supporting a flat and equal structure of peers. The founders are often young themselves so may not understand how pay often rises with experience. This is not the case with larger startups usually once their hiring process becomes more formalized and isn't just one guys assumption. And obviously bigger companies have this worked out. How can I work with these situations and explain that experience is often reflected in salary and paying 15yrs experience the same as 5 isn't always assumed or might be negligent to the more experienced candidate. 

I suffer with hidden disabilities and although to date I've not needed any workplace help, I do have a little bit of experience I can share. With my disabilities, I am officially diagnosed and as such covered completely by the Equality Act 2010. I reckon based on your details, you would also be covered but I am not a legal expert. Under the Equality Act, you have a right to "reasonable adjustments" to be made by your employer. Your employer does not have duty to suggest adjustments. So, if you have any suggestions, these need to come from you. From your question, I believe you have done this and its been rejected - a bad move on their part given your legal rights. There are plenty of resources for you to help you make an informed decision on what to do next. The two I recommend as ACAS as they can get involved in any employment disputes and Mind. Have a read through this page on the Mind website. I believe you will find it relevant and there is a letter template on there for you to provide the details of what reasonable adjustments you may need. My recommendation is if you haven't already put your reasonable adjustments in writing sending copies to your manager and HR department. If you do not get a reasonable response to this then potentially they are breaching your rights. ACAS would be good to assist with this. A union would also be a fantastic resource if you are a member. This type of thing is right up their alley. Good luck! 

I work in a field and industry where telecommuting is a feasible option for my role, and it is usually a matter of whether an employer will support it as a company policy. I've worked for both types: some that openly support it on a part-time basis (2 days a week usually), and some that don't support the idea at all. I usually find part time good, as opposed to 4/5 days, as it allows for in-person time to resync with employees or get face-to-face meetings done on those days. At this point in my life I have a family and a young infant in daycare near our home. My wife and I both work, and commute 1-2 hr to our jobs in the NYC area. My wife is able to work from home and only needs to commute in a couple days a week. On those days, I need to be home to manage the child drop off and pickup, as well as any occasional problem that might occur. My question is how do I work with potential employers in interviews or even an existing employer and express that this is not just a work preference, an occasional "cable guy coming by" event, but an actual family planning thing that is needed on a highly predictable 2-day a week basis? For the interview: - I frequently bring up the question as one of company culture on working from home. This is usually met with, "we allow it occasionally for one off appointments, but we prefer everyone to be in the office". They usually back it up with management's opinion that this is best for cooperation, on a company level. Even at the end of a strong interview, it is very difficult for me to pose that it is a strong requirement for me. Even to the point where I might need to be an exception to the rule for a while. How can I express this need without disqualifying myself due to a blanket policy? Should I express this need before even interviewing? Some people have advised to start with a company, and gradually try to work it in as an option. Prove yourself, start occasionally, and maybe they'll come around. I've not found this passive approach very effective. For an existing employer: The topic can be challenging. It can be that several employees in the office do have a WFH arrangement, but new arrangements are generally rejected. As an employee, I end up with the conflict that I need this arrangement or I need to find a new job to accommodate the family schedule. Overall, what can be done to express this to an employer that you otherwise mutually value and wish to stay with? 

I am not sure what industry the job is in but some industries are more strict that others and background checks must be completed. However, my personal experience of this is that they do not usually give you a start date until completion. The longest I've had background checks take before being issued a start date was 6 weeks. It was solely because one of my previous jobs were being extremely slow with my reference. I would recommend you start looking for a back up but in the meantime, it would not be remiss to email your contact along the lines of "I am really keen to start with you and am available immediately. Is there anything I can do to assist with the checks?" In my personal case, it required me to visit the employer and chase my reference in person. Hopefully that gives you an idea on what you can do in your particular case. Another thought is has your previous employer filled your position? If you are still on good turns, why not see if they would like you to stick around a few more weeks for the "transition period"? 

I would NOT give notice until the bonus is in your bank account (and cleared). Even if you've been given a letter that states your bonus and the paydate. I had a coworker miss out on a fairly sizable bonus because he put in his notice between being notified of it and it being deposited with direct deposit. While this may not be the most professional if 2 weeks is required, if you want to guarantee the bonus I would suggest waiting until after it is in your bank account, then give a late notice stating your last day is the end of the month due to a pending move. Make it a professional resignation notice otherwise, and it should be reasonable. Since you already have another job lined up, there is not really much they can do overall besides send you on your way.
