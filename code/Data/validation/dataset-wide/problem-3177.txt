It was the Romans who came up with the idea of "citizenship." (civus) From there, it was a short step to "civic responsibility." $URL$ 

After France lost the battle of Sedan, some of the best defenses of French territory were conducted by franc-tireurs, or what we would call snipers, operating "American Revolution" style, civilians sharp-shooting from cover (as opposed to the European formation infantry). They were originally organized as light infantry, as an "adjunct" to the military, as "irregular" troops. When captured, franc-tireurs were summarily executed by the Germans. The reason given were that they were ununiformed troops without a chain of command. (only the first of four Geneva Conventions had been adopted by 1871). So two questions arise: 1) Why didn't the French military issue uniforms, badges, and chains of command to militia units that had been organized, and were operating as franc-tireurs in order to comply with then-existing military customs? 2) Why didn't the "regular" French military adopt "guerrilla tactics?" Put another way, was there a genuine fear/feeling that "lack of uniform" was only an "excuse" for executing guerrillas, and that even regular soldiers performing as guerrillas would be executed? 

According to "Generations" by (the late) William Strauss and Neil Howe, an important factor was the concurrent birth of the so-called World War II generation (1901-1924). Elders of their day, in connection with the new century, wanted to create a better nourished, protected, (and educated) group of children than what they themselves were, using the latest nutritional technology discovered in the 1890s. The result was that this generation grew nearly an inch taller (on average) than their parents, giving them a height advantage over the Nazis (and Japanese) in World War II. This concern, in turn, had been stoked by America's fear of war stemming from World War I. A second impetous was the publication of Upton Sinclair's 1906 book, "The Jungle", about Chicago meat-packing plants that was "aimed at America's heart and hit its stomach instead." This and other publications got America to thinking about the quality of its food, just about the time other early "environmentalists" like President Theodore Roosevelt got America to thinking about the quality of the air and water. In any event, all of the above was the product of a "turn of the century" reform movement. 

The "core" Mongol group was too small, relative to its empire. Even today, "Mongolia" has just over 2 million people. In 1200, it was more like 1 million, with an army of 100,000. Compare this with the fact that China had about 100 million people, Persia, perhaps 20 million, and Russia, perhaps 10 million (population sizes vary depending on how these "countries" are defined). That's too many people for 1 million Mongols to control. In theory, the Mongols could have used "proxies," but they were culturally backward, and could not control more advanced and populous nations, except by force. Only Genghis Khan and his immediate successors could do this, and the longer the length of time after his death, the more Mongolian control was lessened. 

The German versions of "Jud Suess" and "Der Ewige Jude" were not criticisms of Hitler. But they were "take-offs on American (Jew Suess) and British (The Eternal Jew) films of the same names that were critical of Hitler. The German versions were "sponsored" by Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, who took a personal interest in "turning" the Anglo-American films. It is highly unlikely that he would allowed the production of anything critical of Hitler (although it is barely possible that individual critical passages were "slipped in"). The Nazis were cynical, hypocritical people, and it was not above them to "overrule the interests of [legtimate authority and]... amend the constitution." Their only quarrel with such actions was when Jews did them. 

It was in Italy that (initially) non hereditary titles of nobility were granted for military prowess. That's because these titles were not grounded in ownership of land.According to Wikipedia: 

The country was England, and "proved son" in this context means "legitimate son." Leofric probably had many sons, but only one by his lawful spouse, Lady Godiva. More to the point, he had affairs with a bunch of other women, who produced sons that may or may not have been his. The more important issue (absent today's DNA tests) is: was Lady Godiva's son actually his? English law strongly presumes this to be the case, except when it was basically impossible (e.g. when the man had been away from home for a whole year before the child's birth). Given that Leofric cohabited with his wife, and the child at least somewhat resembled him, English law presumed, and therefore "proved" that the child was his. 

The Canonigo may have been charged initially because it was not clear what part he had played in the fracas. But ultimately, he was absolved because it was a case of "no harm, no foul." 

The person that comes to mind is Getulio Vargas of Brazil. He first took power in 1930, in a military-backed coup, after being defeated in a Presidential race, ousting the outgoing President and President-elect. He ruled as a virtual dictator until 1945, at which time he was forced to step down from the Presidency, and allow democratic elections, because his participation in World War II alongside the Allies had undercut the legitimacy of his quasi-Fascist regime, the so-called Estado Novo. In 1948, after his successor, Gaspar Dutra had wasted the foreign exchange reserves accumulated by the country during World War II, Vargas was re-elected President by democratic means. When right-wing military officers thwarted his statist policies (following the creation of "national" steel, mining, petroleum, and electric companies) he "fell on his sword" by committing suicide/ But he left a suicide note that stymied his enemies, and thereby maintained Brazilian democracy for several more Presidential elections, until 1964. 

Yes. Hitler's book, "Mein Kampf" was the second best selling book in Germany in the early 1930s (after the Bible), and laid out his views in excruciating detail. Most people had access to the book, not all read it, but it (and Hitler's other views) were featured in newspapers such as the Volkische Beobachter. Perhaps the more important question, as Denis pointed out, was why people voted for Hitler knowing these views. The issue is that being "anti-Semitic" was not nearly as pejorative in the 1930s as it might be today. Hitler basically ran on an "anti-foreign" platform; tear up the Versailles treaty, whose repayment provisions were choking the German economy, and overstep the territorial limitations embodied in that treaty (re-militarize the Rhineland, unite with Austria, and more). And on the same subject, Germany would settle accounts with those of its citizens that presumably benefited from World War I and contributed to Germany's defeat by aiding "foreign interests," thereby administering a "stab in the back" to Germany. Such views, while abhorrent, were not too far from what was then the mainstream of German politics. So did the Germans of the time "know?" Yes, or at least they should have known by reading the book or at least about it. Did they care? Perhaps not. Or perhaps to the extent that they did "care," Hitler's views would have worked in his favor. 

The important thing to know is that the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts represented the "high water mark" of the Federalist Party. Put another way, it rose and fell with these two acts. The Federalists had always controlled the Senate, and the 1794 Congressional elections gave them control of the House of Representatives. Finally, in 1796, John Adams beat Thomas Jefferson for the Presidency by three electoral votes, with Adams getting the five New England States, New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware, and Jefferson getting six southern states plus Pennsylvania. The Federalists represented the business and banking interests of the Northeast United States, in the manner of Alexander Hamilton, while Jefferson represented the southern, agrarian interests. The Federalists justified the passage of the Acts through Hamilton's doctrine of "implied powers" of the Constitution. Lastly, the Federalists had benefited from foreign developments; the French Revolution and a near-war with France in 1797 strengthened the hands of the pro-British, pro central government, Federalist against the pro-French, "states rights" Jeffersonians. The "countervailing" coalition of southern agrarians and northern immigrants defeated Adams and the Federalists in 1800; New York state "switched sides" and gave its electoral votes to Jefferson (and Aaron Burr), meaning that Jefferson and Burr each had eight more electoral votes than Adams. After being named President by Congress, Jefferson let most of the Alien and Sedition Acts "sunset" in 1801, and pardoned most people (his allies) that had been fined or imprisoned under them. As to why the Supreme Court didn't do anything, it was not a full "third branch" of government at the time of the Alien and Sedition Acts; in fact, not until the principle of judicial review was established by Marbury v. Madison in 1805. Recent Supreme Court decisions on free speech suggest that the Alien and Sedition Acts would have been found unconstitutional by a fully empowered Supreme Court.
