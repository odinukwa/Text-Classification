From Fox News ESPN pulls Asian-American announcer from Virginia football game because he has a Confederate general's name 

with text afterwards mentioning a charity that's raising funds to purchase uniforms. Do people end up missing out on school for want of a uniform? I'm somewhat suspicious of the source - I suspect that a charity could be creating an overly-simplified explanation for what's going wrong so that they can raise funds. The claim being made is even more extraordinary considering what can happen to people who aren't allowed to attend school. 

I'm not skeptical that the "little girl" has gone to university, but I'm skeptical about whether World Vision can claim credit for it. While Mongolians may be stereotyped as a country of nomadic herders, by non-Mongolians and Mongolians alike, data from UNESCO indicates that a significant number of Mongolians go to university, and that women aren't under-represented at uni overall. Anecdotally speaking, I've heard that sometimes people from the countryside go to the capital Ulaanbaatar to get an education, and don't return to the countryside afterwards. As background, I've heard that Mongolians from rural areas often go to boarding school, and start education later and finish education later. Mongolia is only 2% Christian, so there could be an ulterior reason for an Evangelical Christian charity to target little Mongolian girls rather than little Australian or American girls. (Their FAQ on this, Wikipedia section on evangelism) Is World Vision's child sponsorship program responsible for people going to university in Mongolia? Also, compared to countries where World Vision advertises for aid, do Mongolians have difficulty going to university? 

Were "Comfort women" well-paid? My question is about whether they were well paid, and not about whether "Comfort women" were sex slaves. I want to be able to rebut specific claims when encountering negationists, rather than "knowing" that "Comfort women" were sex slaves but not knowing how to prove it. For what it's worth, this is what I had in my bounty message: 

Was inbreeding responsible for haemophilia in royal families in Europe? Example claims: Rationalwiki: 

Several users have since asked for a source, and checking his Twitter feed he hasn't followed up with a source. I know that some children die from guns within their household, but I find the statistic very surprising, unless I've misinterpreted "household Firearms [sic]". Do 3400 Americans die from firearms every five weeks? And are they from guns in their own household? 

In case media reports aren't sufficiently reliable, much information about rabies is confirmed in a WHO document about rabies. Note: it doesn't discuss the possibility of rabies being transmitted sexually. It mentions the behaviour of rabid donkeys in a section titled "Q2: How is rabies transmitted?": 

In this image, the flag (the Rising Sun Flag, not the ordinary Flag of Japan) can be seen on the floor. However, it is part of a exhibition about World War II, and in this instance it can be walked around if one so wishes. (That being said, I'm rather surprised that a war memorial let a flag be projected upon the floor - I thought they would treat flags, even enemy ones, more sensitively than that) That image can be seen at A sombre experience at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, (not Sydney) a blog post by Dean Wickham showing several photos from the memorial. 

The screenshot is from a tweet by Rita Panahi, and the allegation was also made in the Herald Sun (paywalled), a major Australian tabloid newspaper, in a column by Panahi called "The sexual assaults in Cologne show even the harshest facts must be faced" (January 11, 2016): 

The article was posted 14 January 2016, but it has been shared recently, such as this tweet (718 retweets, 662 likes) posted soon after the Stockholm attack: 

Yes. However, he neglected to mention one detail during his performance. Swastikas are a common symbol in Buddhism. Buddhism and Shinto are the two most common religions in Japan (with people often practicing both). More likely than not, the swastika in question was not representing Nazism, the ideology of one of Imperial Japan's allies in World War II. 

Were staff at Bletchley Park predominantly male, especially the ones involved with the most highly skilled aspects of the decryption effort? 

As far as I can tell, the putative explanation is that some (but not all) people in Japan are ethnically different from some (but not all) people living in countries in Europe, North America, or Australia, and that those ethnic differences may be associated with different average body temperature. While I'm primarily interested in Japanese people, any answer with a reliable source that says different ethnic groups have different body temperatures will be welcome. If you're of the opinion that different ethnic groups do not exist, then this claim may be a little hard to negate, but a study showing no differences between body temperature of people who live in Japan and people who live in a country perceived as predominantly caucasian would go a long way to debunking this myth.

Is a large wolffish the result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident? Yahoo News in Is This Giant Mutant Wolffish A Result Of The Fukushima Nuclear Disaster? states that some, unnamed, people think it the result of the accident: 

Deutsche Welle, a more "mainstream" media outlet, had an article written on January 8 mentioning proposals to change the law, and described the status quo: 

Asians have vaginas that are the same as people of European descent. Inspired by Oddthinking's suggestion of using Chinese Sex Ed or biology textbooks, I decided to use something slightly more convenient: Wikipedia. The Japanese and Chinese editions of Wikipedia use the same diagrams for vaginas as those for European languages. They don't use a parallel set of diagrams for European and Asian vaginas. From the Chinese edition of Wikipedia about vaginas: 

Like the commenter, I suspect the conversation did take place. However, I don't know if the explanation, that the USA bombed Hiroshima, eliminating virtually all buildings, enabling the government to start from scratch and change the layout of its streets, is correct. Did Hiroshima change the layouts of its streets subsequent to the war, using the opportunity based on buildings being damaged or destroyed by the bombing? 

A Japanese friend of mine claimed that Allied forces used poisonous gas during the Battle of Okinawa. I asked for a link to such a claim, and got a link to this section of the Japanese language Wikipedia article on the Battle of Okinawa. The paragraph that mentions chemical weapons is 

Is Julian Assange being charged with sexual assault merely because he's alleged not to use a condom? I heard the claim on Australian talkback radio station 2UE this afternoon, and the following was the second hit I got while googling for : Wikileaks Julian Assange rape charge for not using condoms 

In the article "Dolphin hunt claim denied" (page 3 of mX Sydney, 25 March 2015), Australia for Dolphins chief executive Sarah Lucas refers to "the violent and unsustainable dolphin hunts in Taiji". The article doesn't specify what "unsustainable" means. I'm not skeptical of the claim the hunt is violent (killing any animal for food is violent), but I am skeptical of the claim the hunt is non-sustainable. I tried doing a search for dolphin hunting being unsustainable, and only got hits from organizations related to the abolition of dolphin hunting, rather than organizations concerned about the conservation of species or ecosystems. Is dolphin hunting in Taiji unsustainable? 

As the Smithsonian seems to be a fairly reputable magazine specialising in subjects such as science, technology, and art, and researched the issue first-hand, I have to conclude that cargo cults really existed in the form described by Feynman. 

Can earthquakes and volcanic eruptions be "due" or "overdue"? As in "They typically happen every X years, we haven't had one for Y years, so we're more likely to have one now"? I heard Kevin McCloud saying something along that line in "Escape to the Wild", about a volcano in Chile, but also lots of other times. Example claim 

In Adam Higginbotham's article Chernobyl 20 years on, it's implied that nuclear radiation increases the risk of heart attacks: 

Mongolia Mongolia is a counter-example to the claim, being Asian and in certain circumstances it's acceptable to wear shoes inside a home. (Gers are not a fixed structure, so I don't think it's necessarily a house, but they definitely are homes) Mongolia is an Asian country: 

A friend of mine came across an article about the Tokyo Waterworks Bureau, saying that during a football match that was a major qualifier between Australia and Japan, staff had to monitor the match. During breaks in play, they had to increase water flow due to increased use of the bathroom, and they had to decrease water flow when play was happening. I also once saw on a documentary that electricity usage spiked in the UK just after the end of a popular soap opera, because people put on a kettle for a cup of tea. Again, staff working for the UK's electricity grid had to monitor when the soap opera ended, and adjust electricity production accordingly. I'm accepting of the claim that spikes in water usage and electricity usage can occur. But are they major enough, as claimed, to require monitoring by staff? 

I also came across an article in the neo-nazi site The Daily Stormer (Wikipedia description) Forbes Journalist: “I Suspect Anti-Immigration ppl of Organising the Cologne Sex Crimes”, which has an archive.is link of the alleged tweet. However, archive.is explicitly denies that it can be trusted not to doctor or alter pages: 

While the question seems to use the word "Mongolian" to mean "Asian", (a rather dated term for native speakers), I may as well include literal Mongolians as well. The Mongolian word for vagina is "үтрээ" according to Bolor Dictionary (Mongolia typically uses Cyrillic for its language nowadays). Doing a search for "үтрээ" came up with a diagram from a page titled Нууц хэсэгтэйгээ танилцаарай бүсгүйчүүдээ!, which Google Translate translates as "Explore the women inside khesegteigee!" (Google left "khesegteigee" untranslated - it corresponds to the word "хэсэгтэйгээ"). The web site domain name is Mongolian (.mn), the content of the page is Mongolian, and the text of the diagram is almost certainly Mongolian, because the first word is "эмэгтэй", which is the Mongolian word for woman. There's nothing unusual about this diagram indicating that Mongolian women have different anatomy from people of European descent. 

I just read about the concept of menstrual leave. The Wikipedia article says it originated in Japan, and applies in a couple of asian countries. In 2005, Australian Manufacturing Workers Union secretary Doug Cameron asked for menstrual leave to be available for women working at Toyota (in Australia): 

Some phenotypes caused by recessive genes occur in sub-populations that tend to reproduce with other members of the sub-population. For example, Tay-Sachs disease is a recessive genetic disease caused by having two bad alleles of a gene, and mainly occurs in specific sub-populations who reproduce with each other: 

On social media, one tweet a couple of days ago (January 2018) by conspiracy theorist @PrisonPlanet got thousands of retweets and likes. The video quoted in the tweet had in subtitles of the thumbnail something like "die safe shorts" schützt vor übergriffen achtung nicht erschrecken". I tried google translate, but it didn't work too well. I came across a comment from a couple of days ago on a politically extreme reddit expressing doubt about this story (link deliberately omitted): 

Is any underground activity happening at all? If there is economic activity, was most of it gambling in the accepted meaning of the word? I suspect that relatives of cancer sufferers may be worried about medical bills, and would be willing to pay a certain amount of money to ensure that if their relative survived for a few months and therefore got more of a medical bill, that they'd have some extra money to pay for it. Maybe the decreased payouts after 6 months or more is to ensure that only genuinely terminally ill people are bet upon, rather than elderly relatives. By contrast, if someone (other than the bookie) is betting on an individual they have no financial interest in, then that would be seen as gambling. 

From The Independent Germany to tighten rape laws in wake of Cologne attacks, but a search for Google News of "rape Germany laws" also gives matches for The Daily Mail, and Russia Today: 

Citation 31 is "Tanaka Yuki (2002). Japan's Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery and Prostitution During World War II and the U.S. Occupation. Routledge.". This book received a mixed review at $URL$ . Not universally bad, not universally good. I'm skeptical that infection rates were as high as was claimed. (This is regarding allied troops from western countries such as Australia and the United States, not the Soviet Union) For the high rates to occur, a very high proportion of soldiers would be having sex with someone who they weren't married to, and either not be using condoms, or have had their condoms fail on them. Sex outside of marriage, let alone sex with a prostitute, would go against the Christian or Jewish religious norms of most western allied troops of that era. In addition, unless condoms were failing at a massive rate, a high infection rate would indicate that a lot of soldiers were choosing not to use sexual protection even with women who have a lot of partners. The motivation I suspect for inflated numbers is to make western countries look bad, and also to make Japan's actions during World War II seem not so bad in comparison. Was the rate of sexually transmitted disease as high as 55% in allied troops from western countries?

I'm slightly doubtful that a price on carbon is primarily responsible for reducing demand for electricity by that extent in just six months. I would have thought that electricity usage was something that most Australians would have thought about even before the introduction of a price on carbon. Climate change has been a major point of discussion in the more "upmarket" media, and rising electricity prices has been a major topic in the more "tabloid" media. Has electricity demand dropped by 8.6 percent in six months in Australia? And is that drop largely attributable to the introduction of a price of carbon? (For the purposes of this question, "a price on carbon" should be treated as prices specifically designed to prevent the production of greenhouse gases, as opposed to the market price of fossil fuels) 

"MSESPN" is a derogatory term for ESPN. From the same blog, ESPN Profit Plummets As Network Turns Left: 

Is it possible for rabies to be spread from donkeys to humans? People have received medical treatment on the assumption that it can be spread via biting. A man was treated for rabies after being bitten by a rabid donkey. From Man bitten by rabid pet donkey: There are fears that he may contract rabies: 

The reported German quote is said to be "Dann wird das Reich eben einmal die nächsten hundert Jahre ohne Physik und Chemie ausokommem". "The German Chemical Industry in the Twentieth Century" describes it as an anecdote, and cites "Karl Holdermann, Im Banne der Chemie: Carl Bosch, Leben und Werk" (Düsseldorf, 1953), 271-273. I don't know how reliable the cited book is. Someone more knowledgeable about chemistry, German history, or who is fluent in German may be able to dig deeper. Hopefully Germans in the 1950s weren't in the habit of making up bogus quotes to support their own beliefs.
