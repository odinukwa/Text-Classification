Phyllosilicates are just clay or dissolved rock, with one or more OH- molecules. Ammoniated Phylosilicates, instead of having an OH- (Hydroxy group) have one or more NH2- (amides) or perhaps NH4+ (ammonium), which is a different charge so that wouldn't replace the OH but might still bond with silicates with hydro-thermal mixing. From this article. 

If you don't mind speculation, it seems to me that a massive impact - like the one that is thought to have formed our moon, but even larger, could eject shards like that. That such a shard could escape it's solar-system and fly through space between solar-systems isn't unreasonable. Asteroids (to my understanding) are somewhat loosely formed and an elongated shape like that is unlikely. A small moon or larger asteroid near a super-nova might get turned into an elongated shape like that by the blast as another speculative answer. A 3rd possibility might be a ejection from a high velocity and somewhat violent debris disk, perhaps from a planet that fell inside the Roche limit of a white dwarf star. It's still an object that's strange for two completely separate reasons. It being the first ever object observed to be passing through our solar-system and it's thought to be very unusual shape (footnote - better images would be nice). Still, the intersection of two unrelated firsts scores high in statistical improbability, even if the shape can be explained, it still leaves open the question of why two never before seen events coincided with the first ever observed exo-asteroid. 

You should look at the Earth-Moon as a closed system. For a closed system, angular momentum remains constant, but angular momentum in this sense, is around the barycenter. The Moon's angular momentum, in the sense that Wikipedia means isn't the Moon's spin but the Moon's orbit. As the Moon moves away from the Earth, it's velocity decreases but it's angular momentum around the barycenter increases because angular momentum is a product of both velocity and distance from the center. Jupiter, for example, has about 71% of the total angular momentum of the solar system. See article, which I think is related to your question. Finally, 

Rogue Planet Your scenario mentioned planet-like. Now, if it's a planet from our solar-system, that would imply disturbing the orbits of Earth/Venus/Moon, which you specified you didn't want. There's also real danger if you were to have a planet like object in a near Earth orbit that passes from time to time, close enough to cast it's Umbra over Earth. For safety reasons "just passing through" is the way to go. A rogue planet on a hyperbolic trajectory past the sun that, by very rare coincidence, passes between the Earth and the Sun, but close enough to cast it's Umbra over Earth would be very rare to say the least, but a theoretically possible scenario to cast a total eclipse over Earth, but it would need to pass very close and at just the right angle to block the 1/2 of 1 degree of arc that the Sun takes up in the sky. How close? Mars is roughly twice the diameter of the Moon, so would need to pass within about 750,000 km to the earth, and line up just right, to cast a tiny umbra that moved across the Earth. Venus, about 3.5 times the diameter, about 1.3 million km Jupiter, about 41 times the diameter of the moon, would need to pass within about 15 million KM to cast an umbra on the Earth of similar size to the typical Moon's eclipse Umbra. And those are the minimum distances. You'd need the theoretical planet to be pretty well inside those limits to have an Umbra of significant size and for a 3 hour eclipse, bigger is better. What would a rogue planet passing that close look like? Consider that it's passing close enough that it looks larger than the Moon, at least for a 3-plus hours. How close it would need to be depends on the size, as noted above. The minimum velocity for an object on a hyperbolic trajectory just passing through the solar system but near Earth distance would be Earth's escape velocity, or the orbital velocity of the Earth (108,000 kph) times the square root of 2, and if it approached on the same plane and in the same direction as the Earth, the relative velocity between this Rogue planet and Earth, the minimum relative velocity would be about 45,000 kph, give or take. That's absolute bare minimum as a theoretical rogue planet passing inside the Earth's orbit would usually be traveling a fair bit faster than that. So, for a planet like that to remain between the Earth and the Sun for 3 hours, it would need to be about 3 times 45,000 km in diameter, or, nearly the size of Jupiter. A small rogue planet couldn't cast an Umbra over Earth anywhere close to 3 hours because it would pass over the Earth much too quickly. A Jupiter-sized Rogue planet could, theoretically, if it was closer than closer than 15 million km, cast it's umbra over Earth for 3 hours or so, but that would be close enough to change the Earth's orbit and, at the very least, give the Earth significant climate change by pushing the Earth a few million km either closer or further from the sun. Not an ideal scenario. So there's no scenario that does what you ask. You'd need a planet the size of Jupiter, with the mass of Neptune or perhaps less to leave the Earth/Moon undisturbed. A Neptune mass planet with a large ring system . . . just maybe. But given how rare your scenario is to begin with, I'm going to say basically no. You could do it, but it would change the Earth's orbit, or you could do it with a smaller planet but for much less than 3 hours. In any case, it would be a preposterously rare scenario no matter what. What if we move the Moon? With rogue planets, I just looked at the relative velocity between the planets, which is close enough for a near-sighted umpire. When you look at the Moon's umbra, the Moon's motion is much slower, so you also have to take into account the Earth's rotation too. The Moon (Synodic period), takes 59 minutes to cross the sun, that's tip to full cover, and another 59 minutes back to tip. (based on a 29.5 day synodic orbit, 29.5 days to cover 360 degrees, the sun, roughly 1/2 of 1 degree in the sky). So, 158 minutes of partial eclipse, and a record, of 7 minutes total eclipse in one spot on Earth (7 minutes, the record for a total eclipse is possible when the Moon is slightly larger than the sun, close to it's perigee). So if our mad scientists pull the moon closer to the Earth, the period of time for a total eclipse increases but the rate that the Moon moves across the sun also increases, so you're effectively increasing the 7 minutes of total but decreasing the 158 minutes of partial. If you pull the Moon all the way into a geostationary orbit, some 10.5 times closer, the Moon would span an enormous 5.25% of the sky, but it wouldn't move in the sky while the sun would and the sun, which crosses about 1 degree of sky in 4 minutes would pass behind the enormous geo-stationary moon in just 21 minutes. You can't create a 3 hour eclipse by pulling the Moon closer. This is where the Earth' rotation speed comes in. The Moon moves over the Earth in it's orbit at about 3,683 kph, and relative to the sun, but because the Earth is in orbit to, the effective velocity relative to the sun (Synodic not sidereal) is about 8% less. The Moon's umbra effectively moves with the Moon's relative velocity - at least, close enough. The Earth rotates in the same direction that the Moon moves, peak velocity at the equator of a bit over 1,600 kph. In effect, the rotation of the Earth tries to keep up with the movement of the Umbra during an eclipse, but the Umbra moves West to East about twice as fast as the Earth turns West to East. So the solution for your 3 hour eclipse? Make the Moon bigger and push it further away so it orbits the Earth more slowly and it's Umbra moves closer to the Earth's rotation speed, making a 3 hour eclipse, at mid day, close to the equator . . . possible. If we replace the Moon with Venus (3.5 times the diameter of the Moon) and we push it some 3 times further away (which would be pushing the limits of the stability of the Earth's hill sphere), then you'd be a lot closer, as our new "Venus Moon" would move across the sky and across the sun still to fast, but it would move more slowly and closer to Earth's rotational velocity leading to eclipses that stayed in the sky much longer. If you did that, you might get your 3 hours of total eclipse. You wouldn't want to push Venus too far, cause you'd want it a big bigger than the Sun in the sky, but 3 times the Moons distance, it would be about 15% larger and close to the limit of orbital stability. Other silly ideas. Now if you were to Move the Planet Uranus into Earth's L1 Trojan point, which . . . well, the Trojan point would be further away due to the larger planet's mass dominating so . . . that wouldn't work and because L1 points aren't stable, it would also be highly dangerous. Moving on. If you were to move Uranus to where the Earth is and make the Earth a satellite of Uranus . . . we might get longer than 3 hour eclipses every time we were on the far side of Uranus making an orbit. Seems a lot of work though just for an eclipse. . . . but that would work too. OK, I'll stop now. 

For starters, I imagine the physics of the initial orbit of an impact moon would be somewhat complicated, but it seems likely, given an angled impact like the one that's believed to have formed our moon (and hitting at an angle is statistically more common than a direct impact anyway), So, in this scenario, the planet gets significant angular momentum and this angular momentum should dictate the planet's new equator and axial tilt relative to it's orbit. I would think the moon should form roughly along that same equatorial plane, but I'm just guessing. Perhaps it could form several degrees off - not sure. The 2nd point, is, a rapidly rotating planet with a large equatorial bulge and a close moon, if the Moon formed off the equator, would it's orbit migrate over the equator where the gravitation was greatest and would that happen relatively quickly or not at all? That's basically the question. Was the Moon always at roughly 6 degrees off the Earth's equator or has it only moved off an orbit over Earth's equator more recently, perhaps due to the gravitational effect of the Sun? Or are there other factors. Mars' axis is thought to have changed rather significantly due to Jupiter's gravitational effects perhaps 100,000 years agao and it's Moons orbit over Mars' equator which suggests that Mars' equatorial bulge dragged the Moons with it? - or is my thinking way off on that? My thinking is that a planet's equatorial bulge would drive moons towards a 0 degree inclination around it's equatorial bulge and our Moon is different because of proximity to the sun which also has a strong gravitational effect. The 5.14 degrees of inclination is a balance between the Earth's equator and the solar gravity. 

On average, as the Moon moves away it's orbital speed decreases. More distant orbits have less kinetic energy, but again, with a 3 body system it's more complex. OK, I think I see what you're asking on Spin. 

There's no reason why 2 bodies of equal mass couldn't have elliptical orbits around each other. There's an example of that here . The simple way to think about this is, if two bodies of similar mass approach each other, one of two things can happen, they either have sufficient velocity to pass each other with some hyperbolic curving of both objects or there's enough gravitational attraction that they capture each other in orbit, but the shape or eccentricity of the orbit depends on the ratio between the tangential velocity and the orbital speed at the closest pass. For a circular capture the ratio needs to be exactly 1, and that kind of exactness is rare, so we nearly always get an elliptical orbit with an orbital capture. Solar-system planet or moon formation (not moon capture) tends to be much more circular, because elliptical orbits of objects tends to cancel out as large bodies coalesce, but you're never going to get 2 similar mass objects orbiting each other in a condensing gas cloud. Most of the mass inevitably collects in the gravitational center. There can be, however, a tidal influence that circularizes orbits over time, never reaching a full circle, cause that's impossible, but slowly becoming more circular. 

I'm not sure I see the point to this question, but if one of the orbiting objects is hollow and you allow for course correction, then yes, one object passing through the other is possible. I don't see what force would keep the object with a hole in the middle properly positioned so it was in effect perpendicular to the movement of the other objects. There's also problems with the orbits lining up just right rather than missing and giving each other a gravitational push, and with gravitational perturbations from the sun and the moon. A system like that would be a lot easier and require less adjustment if the Sun and Moon weren't there. You'd probably want both orbits to be over the equator to reduce fluctuations, but eliminating fluctuations would be impossible. Every orbit would probably require some adjustment, and while it's theoretically possible, I'm not sure I see why anyone would want too - apart from perhaps it would look cool. 

So, less than 3,000 cm wavelength implies what the LA-Times article said, Methyl and Methylene or CH3 and CH2 groups on fairly long chain carbon molecules, probably tar-like. But that's hundreds, perhaps thousands of molecules that fit those criteria, some with single bonds between carbons, some with double bonds, some maybe more complex and from all the articles I've read, they don't know which ones. They can't tell which hydrocarbons by orbiting spectroscopy, they can only see the signature of the CH3 and/or CH2 groups at the end of the chains. To know which molecules, they'll need to test a sample. So, a mars-like rover is probably going to go to Ceres at some point. Why this is interesting is that these molecules aren't that long lived on the surface of Ceres, because UV light form the sun destroys them and they're location implies they came from inside Ceres, probably by hydro-thermal activity. There's also ammonia rich clay and carbonate rich clay and those are 3 key ingredients to life. None of this is proof that there's life underground in Ceres, but the ingredients are all there (or mostly there). Warm water (below the surface - and Ceres has a lot of internal water based on it's density), and the basic building blocks. It's still a far cry from proof of life as nothing has been found on the surface of Ceres that doesn't exist in comets, other than the implication of underground liquid water. But having all the ingredients in the same place is interesting. Small point to add, but the article above mention Ammoniated Clay and Carbonates. Both of those are building blocks. Neither is organic.
