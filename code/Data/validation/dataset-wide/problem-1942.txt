As Simon suggested, I would also recommend to write an email equally addressed to all parties. Given your bosses are all equal in their work area, and you don't have the situation that one of them takes more care of HR stuff, and the other more technical stuff etc. And even if that was the case, it would be just fair to inform all of them, so nobody would feel left out of the decision. You give them the chance to react to some extent, in what matter they may prefer (condolement for example, or best wishes). That is a good basis for future collaboration, when you cross paths with one of them again. You never know! 

You seem to completely focus on the 'technial factors', I would also recommend informing about the company history / culture to ask questions about that and show interest in the company per se. Especially since you're saying you know the technology like the back of your hand. And even if you're not knowing some little things showing interest indicates a certain level of willingness to learn. Don't forget companies nowadays also put emphasis on soft factors. 

I strongly dislike receiving emails from colleagues that aren't strictly about our work, however interesting or useful they might be, and I would go absolutely mental if someone interrupted me by sending me a link via IM. That might just be me, but the lack of response from your colleagues probably means that they aren't exactly enthused about it as well. On several teams I've worked with I was (sometimes officially, others unofficially) the researcher of the team, and part of my responsibilities was to dig up anything new and cool we could use in our codebase. From my experience, what works best is a casual, in company blog. Every time you find something you'd like to share with the rest of the team, write a somewhat comprehensive article about it, don't just post a list of links without context. It doesn't have to explain the concepts / practices / technologies / tools in depth, but its essential that you point out clearly how whatever you are talking about applies to what you or your team works on at the moment. You could start with the rewrite, write a series of small and casual but comprehensive articles on what new things you introduced to the codebase, what decisions you made and why, discuss challenging issues you faced and how you overcame them. Show real examples from your codebase, point to actual tickets in your issue tracker. In short: context. At the end of the day your colleagues may still ignore you. But this time it won't be because you're spamming them, and you'll have excellent documentation of your thought process and progress of your skills. 

Another way to look at it is to consider whether that activity might be something you'd want treated as a business if it's profitable. You can't deduct your hobbycrafts costs if it's just a hobby, despite being required to report the income; if you want to deduct the costs from the income, then you have to define it as a business. The same applies for those selling on Amazon: to deduct the costs of doing business from the income produced, you must file the very form that acknowledges it's a business. When working for others (such as a non-profit) as a volunteer, it becomes an "occupation" if you have identified responsibilities, a consistent role, or any of many other aspects that show that you function as regular employee (even if unpaid and part-time.) But when in doubt: Ask the other party. They might even give you permission to do something outside of the contract terms. 

Your odds of getting a job that would bring you to the US are pretty low. But if you are already in the US, you have a few options. First, I'd suggest substitute teaching; it doesn't pay great, but technical types are always needed badly, and it would give you an entry point. Second, internship or entry-level jobs may work out if they're for an organization that will eventually have a paying job up your alley. Third, you really need to get back to school and refresh your background, if you can possibly afford it. There may even be special scholarships or funding for someone returning to school at this point in life. The most important thing I'd stress is that you need to show that you are keeping up with the times and are eager to learn. I'm older than you, but I get along with my highly-technical colleagues because instead of thinking "I'm too old to learn all that", I am eager to learn the latest technologies and hone my expertise. The hard part for you, I suspect, is that what you did academically is irrelevant, as is the last 20 years. It's going to be all about what you can do now, what you can contribute and what you can learn to do well that is relevant to today's world. Use all your energy to get started on it right away. If you need to go into a new field, well, there are a number of areas of software engineering that are always short of capable people; there are especially areas of web development that involve programming that's in demand. But don't go to a community college for "web design"; that will be useless. Instead, find a way to develop websites, even if you have to do it for free for a while, just to show off skills, and focus on programming -- Java first, PHP, Ruby on Rails, etc. -- see what's in demand. Thanks to the fear that companies have about discrimination lawsuits, if you can actually do the job, you are likely to land an interview if only as an "alternate" candidate. But you can't do it based on your past; you have to become a "now" person who is useful in 2013. Short of that, you probably could get a job at McDonald's, or something even less desireable. 

Some persons need time to open up! If he is shy, I suggest you to use other communication channels to maintain some kind of work relationship with him, i. e. in this special case: email. It has some advantages: 

If those sites have means to leave personal notes. You could write something along with the update like 'Had a greate time @ X, Now starting a new stage @ Y'. I see similarities to updating your relationship status on social networks. There are people who update the status on the same day, others who wait some month and the third type that never updates these information. If you want to keep the world informed, I would always tend to option 2. Wait till you are certain of the job/relationship and then share it with the world. Because not everybody needs to know, e g. if you quit a week after. If you are comfortable with people knowing everything, and do not think about loosing your face, then you could even post it on the same day. But make sure to write along some conciliating personal notes like mentioned above. 

How do you avoid discussing anything non work related at work? The interest around politics may have peaked after the debate in the US, but in Greece politics (and more specifically the economy) is what everyone is interested in discussing for at least the past couple of years. You'd imagine that it would be far more difficult for us to avoid such discussions, but it really isn't. Just don't talk about politics yourself, and politely excuse yourself from the company when someone else starts the discussion. Coincidentally I've worked in two environments which can be considered polar opposites when it comes to discussing politics, one was a town hall (where politics were actually our work) and the other was the Army (where discussing politics is strictly forbidden). Couple of years after I left my position at the town hall, that involved regular meetings with elected officials, my co-workers there were surprised to find out that (at the time) I was a supporter of a minor opposition party. I had spend nearly seven years in an environment where politics were all there was to talk about without disclosing my own affiliations. I just never talked about it ;) Every workplace is different, but I don't think that in a typical workplace there's much room or time for non work related discussions. Certainly we all take a break once in a while, and we all might get caught in an uncomfortable discussion around the water cooler, but those discussions tend to be short (how long can your break really be?) and easy to evade. My standard excuse when things start getting uncomfortable, or I'm simply not interested in the discussion, is that... I have to get back to work. Simple, isn't it? 

Your contract makes it clear: no other "occupation or business". Having a garage sale is not a business; even the IRS says so. Selling regularly on Amazon is likely to be a business; selling one used item is not. The IRS says, at $URL$ 

In this specific case, I'd suggest avoiding taking it on yourself. Instead, simply acknowledge that it needs to be corrected. 

Many companies in the US do not freeze hiring. 1. Well -of course- hiring varies by industry and arena: You don't really think that construction is busy hiring in December, or retail sales in March, do you? Take a look here for historical numbers by month: $URL$ The differences are easy to spot when you look at, say, Jan 2012 vs Sept 2012, even though the general patterns are similar. There's a nice analysis on monster: $URL$ 

The intent of your contract is to keep your work efforts solely focused on your job, even if it's off-hours. That way, there is no question that anything you develop, during that period of employment, no matter what day or time it may have been done, belongs to the company. You can volunteer, part-time, elsewhere, as long as you aren't given a regular job role. You can play sports and even be captain of the team, as long as you're not paid for it and you don't hold a business-related position in the organization. It's not all that fuzzy. If you want to sell your hobbycrafts on the side, you're breaking your contract as that is a side business. It's not about how -small- the business is, it's that you've agreed that you will have only one job, one occupation, and work for only one business. Period. And even if others get away with breaking their contract, you still would be risking your job if you do the same, and violating the terms to which you agreed. Here is an example from some slightly clearer language in a standard contract; it allows one area of exception that your contract may not spell out: $URL$ 

I had a similar issue once. I wanted an important document from my manager. I planned ahead, I needed it after two month, but within one month I had no answer. So I friendly asked for the state of the matter via mail. Turned out that sth. got mixed up, he politely apologized and after some days I got my documents. You should try the same. It sure will work out. Provided that the the delay is not intended from your manager, if it is, you will notice it in the way he answers. Maybe you should put a second person in CC to have some kind of proof that the mail didn't get 'lost'. 

Address this issue. If you don't clarify it, your boss will bit by bit develop a picture of you being lazy, not caring about the company, etc... Have a talk with him and tell him you have the feeling that there is a misunderstanding. Explain the reasons why you want to be home earlier - preferably kids and wife, and not to watch the new episode of xyz - and show him that you care about the company. Have some facts to back it up, quality of work, you always do your time despite going home earlier. But be cautious not to degrade your colleagues, when you talk about the working hours! 

No, you should not bring this up. You are correct that it could be an issue, a liability, but it's never good form to be intruding into your co-workers' habits. You don't know if he has an arrangement that allows for this, and you are not his boss. It's offensive when employees try to clock other employees. It's never productive, and it puts you in the position of judging someone else's work habits. Unless it -directly- affects you, stop watching the other guy, and just make sure you do what you are supposed to do. 

You'll also have to consider the company's arena and their fiscal year; for example, a company that survives through online sales is likely to add staff some months before the holiday sales hit, to tweak their site for the reality that most retail-type sales occur during the 6-week holiday period (this year, it's down to less than 4 weeks, though, which should make for possible poor retail performance. Companies will also hire for the coming fiscal year, which often means that opening are approved in December -- but so few people are in the office in December that the hiring usually starts at the first of the year. In addition, it's very likely -- but not guaranteed -- that when a company is adding jobs in one area, they're adding in another; i.e. expanding IT jobs will usually suggest expanding accounting, sales, marketing, etc. More to the point, though, you're going to find that this isn't consistent even with a given company; it depends on more factors than can be generalized. But you can view a few years' worth of job creation history, by segment, at $URL$ ========= 2. I suggest you do not send your resume during a hiring freeze. Resumes tend to get "stale" and once they have open positions, they will tend to look at the new resumes first. There are some exceptions where companies will enter resumes into a database, and actually search the database when they have open positions; however, that's not as common as you might hope, and almost all new positions are going to be advertised in some way. If you do submit your resume to a company rather than for a targeted job, do so during the start of one of the more likely hiring periods ... i.e, the first few weeks of January, and right after Labor Day, can work well if new jobs are being created. After Labor Day, you'll also have the advantage of any summer hires going back to school, leaving openings in companies that hire students and new grads. Oh, and while you're waiting for that optimal time to submit your resume, look for specific job openings, and get your on-line info up-to-date and appealing; as a contract worker, I get a lot of contacts from linkedin and careerbuilder, without much extra effort, mostly because my particular work experience contains the right keywords. 

Arguably the simplest form of gamification would be a friendly contest. It could be anything, as long as it's work related, fun, and not too competitive. Fun rewards could range from silly t-shirts to books, nothing too pricey, you don't want people to get fixated on the price. The contest topic should be something related to the current goals of the company / team / project, whichever applies most, and it shouldn't be anything more serious than a friendly challenge. Whoever fixed the most bugs this week gets a silly t-shirt it's quite different than whoever comes last will be fired. Next you could have some kind of leaderboard, if your work has easily quantifiable aspects. To continue with the bug fixes examples, whoever fixes the most bugs each week gets a gold star, or any other silly achievement token you can think of, and every now and then the leader gets a price, bit more pricey than a book (two books?), or a couple of days off work. It would be impossible to come up with specific guidelines for gamification, as the process is entirely subjective (what's fun for me may not be fun for you), and quite dependent on the nature of your profession and the dynamics of your workplace. For example, there were gamification elements in every job I had, even in the strictest and most disciplined environment I had to face, the army. Getting a bit more recreation time than the rest of my company for disassembling and re-assembling my Heckler & Koch G3A4 in record time (don't ask, I don't remember) would be one example. And, of course, no answer on gamification would be complete without a mention to Stack Exchange. Chances are there is (or there will be) a Stack Exchange for your niche, and if you think about it, it's a ready made gamification platform for your company. Have your team mates compete by providing excellent answers or asking great questions, and use the existing reputation / badge mechanisms to quantify their contributions and reward them. If you are a manager, you can always spice things up a bit and ask questions on work related issues yourself, rewarding employees that would give you great answers. What you need to remember is that gamification is not about getting direct and immediate results, but mostly about having fun. Small and frequent rewards, preferably awarding the less illustrious aspects of the job (think: documentation), and always light hearted in nature, as the core concept behind gamification is encouragement and further engagement, not competition.

This is not "discrimination based on personal belief", so your question is moot. Companies are allowed to try to find the best fit for their organization, and one way they do so is to assess whether they think the candidate is a good fit with their company philosophies. Even if your friend had said exactly what they wanted to hear, you have no way to know if he would've actually been hired. It's perfectly legal and acceptable (and normal) for the interviewers to prefer candidates with whom they feel a good "mesh". This is often about personality, but it can extend to interests, philosophies, and any other areas that might affect day-to-day interactions. Virtually nobody is hired purely on technical skills alone. If they were, most in-person interviews would be unnecessary. 

No, it is not common. But the reason for it is that it costs the company money to put together an offer, and they have to also inform other candidates that they have chosen someone else. The purpose is primarily to cut their risk. I'm not sure I'd be too thrilled with a company that played that particular game, though, unless they had at least outlined the potential offer to me ahead of time, so I could compare it with others and decide if they really -were- my first choice.
