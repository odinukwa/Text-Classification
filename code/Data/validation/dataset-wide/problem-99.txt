Many differences are quite easy to overcome. Moderate- and high-gravity-worlders, for instance, can live in a mid-to-low-gravity environment without much trouble, at least for a little while. Plant-men, humans, and slime-molds can share the same atmosphere. Stationary or slow creatures can use hover-lifts to get around. Even some normally-aquatic creatures may be able to get out-and-about, as long as the air is humid. For those that require (or merely demand) full immersion in liquid, broiling temperatures, caustic air, or otherwise extreme environments, however, nothing short of a full environment suit will do... most places. Luckily, the motto of Space Station V is, This Place is Nice 'Cause We Built It Twice. The motto, of course, is untrue. The station was actually built a dozen times, with more on the way; each replica holds the lowest common denominator for the comfortable survival of the maximum number of races. One station is full of water, another hundreds of degrees hotter, and still another filled with caustic air. However, each station is otherwise a perfect duplicate of the original... visually, anyway. The stations beam fully interactive holograms to the others; that way, a magma man can shake hands with a (holographic) water-dweller, and a low-gravity-worlder can carry on a cheerful conversation with a high-gravity-worlder. Ships are automatically routed; where required, transport ships carry passengers to the correct stations. Shops, too, are duplicated between stations, though for a few shops that is simply not possible. Water-dwellers, for instance, are disgusted by the idea of ice cream, and the asbestos-laden magma-man clothing store has little relevance to humans. In those cases, the shops in other locations are only painted store-fronts; while you can look inside and see a magmom buying a cute asbestos solar-flare-hat for her hot daughter, you're looking "through" an otherwise blank wall. The room inside is used for maintenance or storage. Some stores compromise with alternate or holographic wares; or, on the flip side, high-traffic locations are "double-mapped", allowing increased seating without wasting space seating holograms, yet still allowing a merman to wave to his slime mold buddy. As an added benefit, computer-generated holograms can fill a variety of roles, from a basic prerecorded shopping hologram to make shops seem busier than they may actually be, to visually replacing high-dollar items, so shops can look full without stocking useless items. Renting a basic information hologram is much cheaper than hiring and training a real person, and cuts down on the minimum-wage retail-worker drama. Blank walls can be filled with holographic panoramas, making the compressed space of a station feel much larger, while ever-changing scenery alleviates the boredom of what is essentially a modern version of those old airports. 

Keep the bones from traveling - drill a small hole in important bones, like the femur, humerus, and skull. The hole isn't big enough to damage the bone (people may even have these wires installed while they are alive), but once deceased, the bones have a wire run through them, and are bound to a large stone. Moving the bones will break them, but leaving them to rest will keep them whole. 

The first thing the military in the various films do is shoot at the creature with small arms fire. Your monster is quite obviously immune to that kind of damage, and will ignore it, just like the monsters in the films. The next step is larger weapons - tanks, small air-to-ground missiles, and ground-based explosives. Those are unlikely to do much more than mar the finish of your monster, but at least it will notice. The response is the usual mounted weapons: 

Conclusion If a modern desktop computer were kept out of direct contact with weather (sunlight, rain, etc.) in an average climate (say, in a garage or shed), I would expect it to last for between 5 and 10 years. If the same computer were buried in a storage container in the desert (controlled climate, no sunlight, no damp), I would guess that it would last up to 20 years. The first thing to fail would probably be the data storage. However, a computer with an SSD could be reinstalled with handy DVD installation disks; some computer could even boot and run from the DVD itself. Without a hard drive to worry about, the same computer would live another 10-20 years. An old, single-board computer with solid-core capacitors, bulky wiring, fewer components in general, and much higher tolerance for noise (due to much slower processor speeds) may last centuries; as long as the chips and wires themselves don't decay, the device should keep working for hundreds of years. Even then, there are still simpler computers that would last even longer. The NES, for example, uses a very basic processor with easy-to-replace components, and boots from a cartridge using a die-cast circuit for data. As long as they clean the contacts on the cartridges, someone could be playing Duck Hunt on an NES a thousand years from now! 

If you look at history, you'll see that technology grows in leaps, not steadily. Some of that comes from new knowledge, but quite a bit is tied to the tools used to create more technology. The huge rush of new technology in the last hundred years wouldn't have been possible without reliable vehicles and roads, air travel, and computers. To build even one of those things - say, a computer - you'll have to start at raw materials. 2500 years ago, the best tool available was barely at "pliers" technology, which means that every tool you'll need - including more tools to build those tools - will need to be designed from the ground up. First, the raw materials need to be gathered. Since some of the materials for circuit design are very, very rare, or only come from certain parts of the world, you'll need someone who is a top-level mining expert, who has worked both in the field and in the office. That's at least one person. The raw materials will be bound to rock or other minerals, so you need to know how to extract the materials from the dirt you dug them up with. To do that, your best bet would be a chemical engineer, with broad knowledge of how to obtain, create, and manage the chemicals required to extract or create the metals and other materials you'll need. Very few chemical engineers are also mining experts, so that makes two people. In fact, you'll probably need a scientist and an engineer, so three people thus far. Now that you have your materials - and they will most likely be very low quality - you need to actually build the circuits of... your machinery. Circuit boards of today can't be built by hand, and for the first iteration of tools will have to be built that way. So, you'll need an engineer to build the production machines. You should be able to find someone with a broad knowledge of mechanical and electrical design to build a power station, the machines, and warehouses to hold it all; but, such a person probably isn't cross-skilled in chemistry or mining, so that's a fourth person. After several iterations of machinery to build more precise machines and tools, you should have the materials available to build some simple electronics. At this point, you'll also need a master of circuit design, with deep knowledge of computers, circuitry, and everything that goes with it. The electrical engineer could help to design some of the circuits, but really, you'll need an expert for this, too. That makes five people, thus far. Given those four experts, you should be able to build a working prototype within 50 years - possibly less time, but I expect the mining and refining to take a decade at least. Some materials may take even longer to find or refine. However, they will need a lot of help from the local population - while the mining expert is digging for ore, the rest of the experts should be training students of all ages to replace them and to assist them. For safety's sake, I would bring two or three times that number of people; you never know who will die from illness, injury, or old age. Of course, that's only the computer. The other technologies need similar hard-to-manufacture tools, and more experts that wouldn't have similar skills: 

Not only is it possible, but it's easy! You won't need more than a few pages to adequately explain how to generate simple light. I'll explain how, later, but first I'll answer your other questions. My choice of location would be the late 1400s, to Leonardo da Vinci. He was a brilliant scientist and inventor, and would most likely understand the book and be able to carry out the instructions. More importantly, his exact location in both time and space is well known; you could send the book to his bedroom, if you wanted. And perhaps most importantly of all, not only are the materials required available, but he was at the very start of the scientific revolution. If his plans for a "light machine" were spread over the known world in the early 1500s, life would be very different indeed! Language The very first wall you're going to hit is communication. Depending on where you send the book, you may have to write in a language that is radically different from today. English in the middle ages, for instance, is almost unreadable today, and vice versa. The smart choice would be to use Latin; most scientists read it fluently, and thus could pass the book around all over Europe. Remember also that a picture is worth a thousand words - use a diagram over a "word picture." What the heck is this? If you're sending the book back in time, you don't have the option to actually explain how this book works. Without that, you'll need to write a foreword, a page or two describing what this book is, what it intends to communicate, and how to read it. Explain things like page numbers, how to match the words "figure A" to the drawing, and so on. Importantly, the cover should be waterproof and very garish; if it ends up under a bed somewhere, we want it to be visible, and if it ends up outside, we don't want it getting soaked and ruined. Metals Copper, gold, silver, and iron weren't all that hard to come by in the middle ages, or even earlier. Magnetic materials are a little harder to come by, but not unheard of. To make electricity, you need something to carry it. Copper is a good choice because it's flexible and has a low internal resistance, though really any metal will do. Don't bother explaining electricity, unless you have some room in the footnotes; if the person you send this book to can use your plans, they'll figure it out in short order. Just explain how to make wire, how to insulate it with varnish, and how to wrap it, join it, or otherwise work with it. Motors and generators A motor in reverse is a generator; wrap some wire in a big loop, stick a magnet on a spindle in the middle, and crank - instant electricity! Make sure to include instructions for finding the north and south poles of a magnet, and the proper direction to align them. A multi-step process with better and better motors may seem like a good way to go, but a better approach is to show the plans for the best motor possible (multiple windings per core, multiple cores on a spindle, etc.). Finally, tie it all together. Connect the wires from all the windings into a big bundle, with one big wire coming out of the "start" and the "end" wires. At this point, you have a working hand-crank generator. Or, scaled up, a huge water-driven or mule-pulled generator. Either way, you can make some big sparks. If you'd like, a short note on how to feed this energy back into a motor (with heavier wire) would be a fantastic way to note how practical all this is. Imagine the endless possibilities of water power in the early 1500s! If there's space afterwards, you can explain the physics, but for now, we just want to build a light. Speaking of... Light bulb moment Don't try to create a light bulb - or at least, not one of today's standards. Instead, you'll want to make either a carbon-filament light, or just a simple spark light. The second is easy - inside a big blow-glass ball, have the two ends of the wires really close to each other. When the generator is turned, sparks will jump the gap; the more power from the generator, the brighter the light. This isn't an efficient light bulb; it isn't particularly bright, either. Still, it's a light, right? A carbon filament bulb will be much, much brighter, but won't last as long. Two carbon tubes next to each other, with current applied, with glow as bright as the sun for a little while. Not long, but enough to really leave an impression. Edison used a carbonized bamboo filament with great success, lasting over 1200 hours in good conditions. Vacuum The first vacuum pump wasn't discovered until 1650, 148 years after Leonardo's death. However, with the right help, it wouldn't be too hard for the inventor to come up with his own version. However, technology would not be in place for some time to create enough vacuum to produce modern filament light bulbs. So, devote a few pages to explaining how a vacuum pump works, and how to create an efficient version. With the right carbon filament and enough of a vacuum, a bulb should last over a thousand hours - far more than a candle or a simple oil lamp. Exotic materials and Other Information Today, we use tungsten, because it has a high heat tolerance; however, not only would it be almost impossible to find, it would also be hundreds of years before machines were advanced enough to make a filament. LEDs and fluorescent tubes would also require materials that wouldn't be available or produce-able for centuries. Still, writing it down would be useful; even if the first inventor never made it, his successors would surely find a way. In fact, all these explanations should only be a handful of pages; it's really not that hard to make wire, make the wire into a generator, and make a bulb that the generator powers. So, devote the rest of the pages to the science of electricity: transformers and motors, generators driven by water, wind, steam, or horse-power, AC, DC, voltage, current, resistance, even capacitors, inductors, and various micro-circuits. Include mine locations to dig up any metals or minerals needed to make modern circuitry, and modern maps to guide them. Circuits for telegraphs, radios, even television are simple enough to be included. The sky's the limit! Explain as much about modern machinery as possible; the more information available, the faster scientists and inventors will be able to create it. 

The Earth maintains nearly-constant average temperature due to its oceans. Not only do the oceans act like a huge heat-sink, storing and releasing energy as needed, they also move energy from the warm equator to the colder poles. Without oceans, the temperature will only be limited by the heat absorbed by the ground - so not a lot. The atmospheric density is slightly lower than Earth's as well, which means even less temperature regulation. With only 15% of your world being ocean, my guess is that the global climate of the world would somewhat resemble the climate of Mars, though with slightly higher average temperature. Mars' average maximum and minimum temperatures are -7 to -82 C (19 to -116 F) in the winter, and 4 to -73 C (39 to -99 F) in the summer. However, the long days and nights will grow that gap severely. I don't have any hard numbers, just guesswork, but my guess is that the cold temperatures will reach past -150 C (-238 F), and the hot temperatures will be at or above the boiling point of water. Human life would struggle to survive in domes; outside of a habitat, no human could survive except at dawn and twilight, near the water. 

The Nice Way Promote trade, and reward long-distance interaction. Build roads and inns to promote travel. Make your followers build schools and churches, and teach a common language in all of them. Mock or pity those who speak other languages; send plenty of kind-hearted missionaries to all corners of your domain to spread hope, love, and language. Over time, naturally, languages will blend, and while there may be other languages spoken, there will eventually be at least one common language; even in back-woods corners, there will be at least a translator. The Fast Way Pick the largest language group, pull out some holy zealots, and start killing anyone who speaks another language. Promote and reward anyone who speaks your language fluently; smite any hold-outs, using your flashiest and messiest powers, in the most public way possible. Burn books and other material written in other languages. A good portion of the non-holy-language-speaking population will be wiped out, but this guarantees that the entire area will speak a single language within a single generation. Next, of course, you'll need to go to war with those pesky neighbors... 

That doesn't count cost to the parent(s), either, and it's still a significant amount of money. I imagine that several things would happen within a single generation: 

Destroy the bones - burning, breaking, or dissolving the bones would prevent them from being used. Granted, if this harms the soul, you should only do this with relatives you don't like. Hide the bones - a few possibilities here:
