We should not believe in Y's claims only if there is evidence against them Y claims X There is evidence against X Hence we should not believe in X 

The argument, as you present, certainly does not add up. NA is contradicting his own epistemological stance. NA's acceptance of (1) makes him accept criticism of P (as in 3) by default. NA also makes an appeal to ridicule, conflating tooth-fairy and spaghetti monster to God, and making an implicit assumption that all have equal amount of evidence. 

This is for same reason as St. Augustine writes. Just like something that might be considered a "metaphor" might be recognised as a fact, if it is found that the thing said is true, it might also be that a statement that is found to be false was just a metaphor by the author if that statement is not essential to the belief and the purpose of the author was not to pass information about that matter but for example, lead people to salvation. 

They can be used when the author cannot describe an event using known words as they fail to be an accurate description. So he uses a word that best fits the description and conveys what he wants to convey. When author wants to instill a poetic feel or playfulness in text to make it more entertaining or enriching They are used to create a strong imagery with a particular object whose main properties, the writer wants readers to acknowledge in the object or event that author is "metaphorising" A piece of text is linked to another piece of text. Then one of them can be thought of as metaphor describing the other event by means of less conspicuous analogy. 

So, when we say to a child not to touch hot object, even if their will is to touch it, we refer to future will: the child will be hurt by it and the result of that will be undesirable, which means that future will of the child will be not to touch hot object. So, we take into account the future will when say someone not to do something sometimes. But is there any estabilished term denoting both present and future will? I am asking that because I am wondering if the ethics/morals taking into the account both present and future will can be named "will consequentialism". Or another wording for will generalized to the whole time continuum could be named "sense" but I am unsure about it as well. 

Freedom is a language construct. It is used for conviction. E.g. when some social groups say their freedom is violated, it means they are dissatisfied with current status and want something to be changed. Of course, in order to be more persuasive, they ought to use thick moral concepts. One of such concepts is freedom. Therefore, what really freedom is varies on context pretty well. Sometimes it can mean your first definition, sometimes second. Sometimes it can even mean omnipotence and omniscience. Now answering on your other questions, one by one. 

No. There is no empirical way to prove that other person is conscious. To prove that, you should be able to check validity of empirical findings apart from your consciousness, i.e., you should be unconscious while reviewing those findings. However, you cannot review those finding while being unconscious. Hence, such is impossibility. Even if there is a way to empirically establish that other persons are conscious, you will not know about it, for if you know it, it will be in your consciousness, and hence it may always be the case, that the appearance of consciousness in them, is a reflection of your own consciousness, and they are just an AI. 

Ignorance - That is not knowing enough to make a conclusion Bias - Stressing on some things(properties) that are not as dominant as they appear Mistake - Deriving a conclusion wrongly from a premise Justification by current knowledge/belief - Justifying something to be a result of something that is already believed or known to be true 

As long as you have a goal with an end involving the people that you are using, such that if it becomes a universal law (and thus, applicable on you too), you have no problem, but you actually will that for yourself, then you are fine. 

Therefore, there was some kind of popular moral philosophy at those times. Probably it is not different from currently popular moral philosophy, but has anyone made an effort to show what was morally popular? If so, what were them? I am interested in particularly pre-Kantian moral philosophy, because it was the first (accepted by academics) formulated in our era. Previous accepted by academics moral philosophy is virtue ethics, but it was kinda forgotten by the time when Kant lived. 

The analogy from real life: Let's say you have simulated a world in the computer. If you are tracking what happens there it already is changing you. Because that generates new memories in you thus changing your mind. If you're just watching, it is interaction in our world, but as I said may be not the case outside of it. Conscious changes indeed require some kind of tracking thus if you are consciously changing that world, you (as mind) are changing. And many faiths (probably all) declare that god[s] is/are conscious. 

Why yes? Ask any human whether they consider group sex, promiscuity or other unconventional sexual practices good. With higher than 50% probability answer will be "no". Of course this is the result of Christian faith at least in Western world (as Conifold pointed out). But I'd say it had global influences due to colonization by West (pre-20th century) and globalization. Of course you will point out that I'm saying about unconventional sexual practices. But that's what the question is: it asks not about sex in marriage, but about sex in itself. Since of that and the feeling that minors can be involved in such sexual practices it is considered good to censure sex in society. Obviously, we can't ignore the fact that laws censoring sex may try to reduce teen births as well. But in my experience they are not really effective as the vast majority of 13 year olds (my country laws suggest 16 year old age for sexual consent and right as everywhere 18 year old age for watching porn) know what sex is and even have masturbated. Not surprising at all, is it?
