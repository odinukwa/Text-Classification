A resignation does not have to be "accepted". You are cancelling your contract. That is a one-sided action. If you would need your employer's consent, you'd be a slave and slavery is illegal. The only thing you need to do is to make sure your notice actually reaches your employer. This can be done in various ways. The easiest probably is going into your boss' office, handing in your notice and get a written receipt. This is a standard procedure and every HR department will have forms for this. If this does not work, this means your company is either a disorganized mess or your boss is an idiot. This probably goes hand in hand. If you have to get a proof of handing in your notice on a certain day without help from your boss and HR department, you have two options: you can come up with colleagues who come with you and witness the scene and give you a written testimony that they saw you handing in your notice or you can check with your postal services. Most will have a way of sending letters that are documented. You get a return slip and an explicit confirmation from the postal service that the letter has indeed been delivered on a certain date. The only "acceptance" criteria might be that your letter has been opened on the next business day. For example if you sent it on friday, it got delivered on saturday but with nobody in the office on saturday and sunday, it got opened on monday. That would indeed be a case where while it was delivered on saturday, monday might be the date you have to calculate from. Although your contract may state otherwise (where I live, having notice periods that read "you may quit at every quarter, provided you give at least 6 weeks notice" are common for example), in general Your notice period starts on the day your company is made aware of your resignation. Your company may not chose to turn a blind eye. They are aware of it as soon as their business day starts and your resignation is in. You still need some kind of written proof though if your company is not willing to comply. 

That's a great idea. The best answer I can give you is ask your employees. Only they know what would make them happy. Giving them something they did not ask for and instead ignoring what they really want is not going to raise morale. Ask them, make a list, prioritize it, make it happen. If something is too costly, tell them. 

In Germany, transportation to or from work is generally not paid by the company. The only exception are remote places you cannot reach by public transport like oil rigs. But even then, you'd have to get to the pick off point by yourself. One reason for this is that providing transport or payment for transport is considered a "Geldwerter Vorteil" (literally translated: an advantage worth money) that is taxed just as if you got the money that it's worth instead. For example: if your company gets you a free public transportation ticket for a month worth 40€, you will need to pay 20€ to the state as taxes, just as if the company had given you 40€ cash. Obviously, giving someone a free ticket for public transportation who does not use it, is a bad thing. He might go by bike all month and still pay 20€ taxes for the 40€ ticket, even though he did not actually use it. Figuring out individually who could actually profit after taxes from subsidized transportation is too much hassle for any company I know. If a company says it's subsidizing public transport, that's not true in the true sense of the word. It's not subsidizing. The company is just acting as a reseller, getting a better margin buying the tickets in bulk, so it can sell them to you for a cheaper price. You still pay for them the exact price your company paid, which means you got no "Geldwerter Vorteil" because if you pay 30€ for the ticket, you get something worth 30€, the price listed on the bill from the public transportation company, instead of getting a 40€ ticket for free. For the injury, even if you were injured on company grounds or time or on the way to or from the company ("Arbeitsunfall"), the company itself would not pay. All your expenses would be covered by the insurance that is mandatory. So yes, you will have to take a taxi and I would not ask your employer for transport. After all, if he cannot provide any, the only thing he can do is pay the very same taxi. And we already established, that expenses are yours to pay, whether you are healthy or not. The only exception I can see is if your employer actually is in the business of transporting people. If you need a KTW (KrankenTransportWagen, kind of an ambulance for scheduled, non-emergency cases) to get to work and you work for a rescue service, going through the official channels would probably look strange. Especially arriving in a transport vehicle of a different rescue organisation would probably be frowned upon. 

It sure depends on what you said, but generally, I'd say no. As long as you can do the job, I really don't care who said what on twitter half a decade ago. Who knows if twitter is still in business by that time. I will hire you based on your skills on the job and your personal attitude in the interview. But employers can hire (or even fire in some countries) you based on whatever criteria they see fit. So maybe putting your twitter account name on the application might not be your best move, because I cannot see any benefit. 

The perception of people is fickle and mostly their imagination and bias and personal opinion of you. If you want to be hard working in their "perception", just come 5 minutes early and leave 5 minutes late, so you catch all of their "feelings" about your time at work. If you want to be hard working in terms of "working", make sure your coworkers have your results when they get in. It does not matter when you did this, but they will know you did this while they were home. 

Matter of fact you have a third option: stop pretending it's Scrum and return to command and control. Because that seems to be your current behavior. Sure it's sugar coated and you listen to them, but if you don't value their opinion, you might as well stop pretending. 

Yeah... no. Go with what you have. That's great and should be plenty. If somebody does not value a masters over a github page, you do not want to work there. If you wanted to include your github profile it should be polished to at least the level of your masters/work experience. Anything less would be like serving cold fries with an otherwise great burger. You want to be remembered for what you did well, not the crummy extras. However, polishing to that degree is hard and you don't need it, so think about whether you should put time into polishing it at all. Just leave it off. 

So you are in a job that is cheating you out of money, with a shady legal background, in which nobody is lasting longer than 2 years and the best thing you can come up with is "it's above minimum wage". Don't invest time there. Make money while you need to and in the mean time, find a better job or an education that will allow you to get a better job. 

In corporate Germany (academia may differ), you are supposed to have an "Arbeitszeugnis" (job reference/certificate of employment) for each job you previously held. Referencing actual people as contacts is pretty much unheard of. You can do it, but you will probably get a few raised eyebrows because you will be the only person to do this. Best case, people will think you are a US citizen. "Arbeitszeugnis" is only relevant for actual jobs you had. For purely academic experience, when you apply for jobs, your degree is sufficient. 

Get a lawyer. And talk to your Gewerkschaftsvertreter if you have one. Preferably in that exact sequence. Just because you are right does not mean that you get what you want. Especially in your Probezeit your employer can fire you any day for any reason. If he fires you right after you refuse to do this, you probably still have a good case in court, but until you win that case, you are out of a job and need to pay a lawyer. If you want to refuse, make sure you don't flat out refuse. Show alternative options. What would be the cheapest device that could do what is required? How fast could you get one? It's never good to tell some one "No". It's always better to say "Not this way, but I have another solution to the problem". 

No It's not ethical. You were acting of your own free will when you signed the contract that now makes you stay another month. It's not a hardship or their doing. You did that. In addition, you still get paid. You'd be the first to complain if the company would take the same stance ("he's leaving anyway, why hold up our side of the contract"). The ethical way would be to talk to your company. Notice periods are contractual. Any contract can be changed if both parties consent. If your company allows it, you could have a shorter notice period or none at all. Long story short: keep your promises. Especially those you gave in writing. Breaking them because you don't felt like keeping them in the first place is not ethical at all.
