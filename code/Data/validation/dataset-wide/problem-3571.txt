Barbell back squats are probably the most effective exercise for strengthening everything south of your belt line. Everything else is a half measure or more dangerous. If there was a more effective way to build lower body strength it would be used by professional athletes instead of squats. I'm not sure what your existing knee injury is and what it would preclude you from doing. It's fairly common for people to avoid squats because they have some random knee pain that very well could be resolved by (as you stated) strengthening your legs. I wrote up an answer a while back that you may or may not find useful, it's basically how I structured running and strength training. Backing up a bit though, you should be able to do a squat without pain. If you can't squat (no bar, no weight) without pain then you really do have an injury that you either need to let heal or you need to have some professional medical help for. If you can do that, start working with an empty bar. Then put 5lbs on the sides, and then ramp up. Follow a proper strength training program. Don't look at squats as something other people do. Look at it like a very normal movement for a human being. If you can't do it without pain, it's akin to not being able to lift your arms in the air: it's a problem and you need to address it. Start light, pay attention to your form, and ramp up safely. 

A typical 10lb bag of ON whey protein costs ~$115 USD. There are 149 servings (1 scoop = 1 serving) in a bag. So 24 grams of protein (with negligible carbs and fat) costs $0.77 USD. I don't think you'll find anything cheaper anywhere. And if you do, let me know. 

I don't know what kind of routine you're on, and overtraining is hard to nail down as it presents itself at different levels. The threshold of overtaining gets closer and closer to your target volume as you progress in fitness. At the novice level overtraining doesn't really matter, the effects don't last that long, and you'll recover quickly. At the advanced level it can sideline you for weeks. The line between overtraining and your target goals gets very thin. If you've been working out for a while and you're not already on a solid progression program, you may want to consider moving to one. It maximizes your strength training gains and minimizes your chances of falling into overtraining. It could be a lot of things, but if the only thing you've modified is intensity and you never had problems working out in the evenings previously, overtraining is at least worth considering. In the short term you could try using a small (start around 0.5mg) amount of melatonin an hour or so before you want to go to sleep, but that's duck tape on the leak. If you haven't stumbled across Mark Rippeteo's Practical Programming book I'd recommend it; it offers some excellent insight into this physiology. 

If you can do pullups, that would be my recommendation. In general I frown on isolation work because it's not natural and a good way to get tendinitis and other overuse injuries. With pullups, you have some options that hopefully won't hurt: palms towards you, palms away, and palms towards each other (if you have that piece of gear). I'm not sure what part of your arm is bothering you, but another option is ring or suspension pullups. Those are a bit tougher because you have to stabilize on them, but they're somewhat more forgiving on your joints because you can freely move into a position that's more comfortable. The good news is that regardless of the particular technique you use, you'll get a terrific upper body pulling exercise, with ~85% recruitment of your biceps. If you got tendinitis from doing curls (typical), it's a great learning moment to switch to compound exercises. And in particular, a proven strength training program. 

"Everyone" in this case is patently incorrect and repeating gym nonsense. According to the prevailing logic of gym goers we should all curl and bench press, maybe doing the leg press or smith machine when we notice our legs look pencils. Then back to curling in the mirror. Mark Rippetoe (author, trainer) has written extensively about the benefit of full depth squats for your knees. From Rippetoe's writing: 

I'd really advocate for sticking with the right lifts and getting the form dialed in: the weight amount really doesn't matter other than convenience of being able to walk up the 45lb olympic bar and use it or more. So here's what I'd star with: 

Those "common sense guidelines" rely on the fact that you're relying on weaker muscles and putting load directly on connective tissues. Provided you use great form and light weights, the essay linked above indicates you'll have good results. But that's a far cry from the proper and safe lifting form for heavy deadlifts, lifting heavy things around the house or workplace, etc. Another good reason for practicing rounded back lifts is that often the real world doesn't afford us perfect anatomical conditions. Lifting a child out of a carseat, as an example. There's a bend, a twist, and the weight is fairly far ahead of you. Also, isometrically locking your spine and doing things like a conventional deadlift does strengthen those muscles, in much the same way that a plank strengthens the abdomen. 

You want to start with the support position, or what would be the top of the dip. You can move your hands away from your sides a bit, which will dramatically increase the leverage on your shoulders. As an aside, if you go far enough (with years of training) and you can even hit the "iron cross". I would practice the support position, being able to hold that for maybe ~10 seconds at a pop. Once you can do that, start dropping a little bit, letting your elbows go up/back/out. It will be pretty natural once you have the support position dialed in and have moved up and down a bit to do a real dip. The hardest thing about ring dips (as you're probably experiencing) is the shoulder stabilization, but once you get it I think you'll find them much more comfortable than regular dips. Mark Rippetoe has stated (Starting Strength v3, I think) that weighted ring dips are pretty dangerous, and I'd agree. The loads on your shoulders can be immense if you flare your hands out at all. So there's still a good place for regular dips if you want to pile on weights. But good work on getting some rings, there are some awesome things you can do with them. Check out Beast Skills for stuff like the front plank, Jim does a great job of explaining those. Between front/back planks, dips, l-sits, and pullups they really are a fantastic investment. 

I had a slightly similar situation to yours in that I traveled around a developing nation for a couple of years without access to any form of gym equipment. In short, I would try to do something like this: Gym Days Do full body barbell strength training. One day do squats, overhead press, and deadlifts. The other day, do squats, bench press, and power cleans (or barbell or dumb bell rows). Those are equipment dependent exercises and you'll making the most use of your time. Honestly, you could just do that twice a week and you'd make good progress. Aim for 3 ramping warmup sets of 5, then one set of 5 around 80%, then one set of 5 around 95%-100% (as in 95% of your 5RM, not 95% of your 1RM). Home Days A lot of this depends on your goals, but these are some ideas and you can mix/match. 

You're really on a pretty solid path. Buy a beer for whoever tipped you off to low-carbs and Rippetoe. 

You may want to avoid this. You're doing a barbell front raise, but adding in a ballistic motion with your "explosive" aspect. The front raise is basically a body builder isolation exercise, and with all shoulder activities you want to adhere to strict form given the ease of injury. If you want to get a bar over your head, learn the (quite complicated) snatch. With the snatch, the force to get the bar overhead is via the legs and hips, the arms are simply there to act as ropes at the bottom and support struts at the top. Any "lifting" with your arms is bad, as you'll never be able to lift with your arms what you can explode with your hips and legs. If you want to exercise your shoulders, I highly recommend the seems-easy-but-it's-not barbell overhead press. This is a very difficult lift which humbles even the strongest people. It's also terrific for shoulder development. 

The most successful (pardon the pun) recipe I've seen for weight loss has the same basic ingredients: Control your diet. I think you definitely have the discipline but 500-800 calories is generally pretty dangerous. I'm not being hyperbolic to state that your body will eventually die if you only consume that many calories, but you'll have plenty of serious health complications first to sound the alarms. There are some good calorie calculators out there that will tell you (a) how many calories you need to sustain your current body and (b) what kind of reductions you can think about with corresponding anticipated fat loss. I reject the notion of "it doesn't matter what you eat", and I've seen vegetarians and vegans in particular quite guilty of having terrible macronutrient profiles but wrapping it up in a banner of "I'm eating vegetarian/vegan so therefore it's healthy." Strength training. Several times over again, strength training (typically weight training) has shown to be more effective than "cardio" for fat loss. In short, your metabolism increases as muscle tissue is expensive to maintain from a caloric prospective. Systemic positive health choices. To this I would put in treating any chronic health issues, getting sufficient sleep, and trying to move around rather than sit down throughout the day. You mentioned that your current weight gain and fitness loss is over a roughly 8 year period. It took a while to get where you are, and it will take a while to get back from it. Fortunately it won't be 8 years though, I think reasonable in-the-mirror-changes can be expected within the first six months if you stick to it. It's a whole lifestyle change, but arguably the most critical for any of us to make. 

Very few people really have this one dialed in. Maybe you do, but odds are you don't. There's a great website I've used called Body Recomposition and the writer is a pretty qualified guy who goes into nutrition. Speed and endurance are the two primary levers you can play with as a runner. And when training, you are generally tackling one or the other. You combine them both on race day, but that tends to beat your body up pretty hard. In the 5k distance range, you have three types of training that come into play: 

Calories in, calories out, and the nature of the food you eat. This will have the largest impact (by far). Basically you need to dial your calories and macros in tighter so you're not taking in so many calories. Strength training. You're doing that already, but be careful because if you start to reduce your calories too much you can lose a bit of strength, and/or not progress as quickly. Aerobic activity. Running, swimming, cycling, and other activities will consume more calories although people tend to have a habit of over-eating to compensate. Don't burn 300 calories and reward yourself with a 500 calorie meal. 

Consider getting a pair of rollers. Rollers, with a fan in front of you and a mirror to your side will help you a lot in riding fast and getting your form dialed in. Rollers in particular are a great way to get rid of hobby-horse-hips and smooth out your strokes. Rollers are also one of the preferred ways to warm up before a race because you can ride 20 feet from the start line, and toss them in your car with a couple of minutes before the gun. 

If all you have is that bar, you can do three valuable lifts. Do all of them: building one part of your body up and ignoring the others will make you weak, prone to injuries, and have a funky posture. 

Provided you have no underlying conditions that would make exercise harmful for you, I don't know why you'd have any problems. Perhaps just ensure you walk around for a couple of minutes before you tackle the 30 floors. As a bonus, in the event of a fire or other emergency you'll know those things like the back of your hand. 

"General old age" isn't marked up there, and although those monkeys managed to hold on to a few more years, I don't think they're plagued by the same diseases that human beings are. This is one of those times where I think the difference between humans and apes becomes clear. Monkeys don't work office jobs, don't drive cars, don't sit on sofas, and didn't have a more than 2x increase in their life expectancy in the last two thousand years. Medical care has allowed us to far surpass our old average life expectancy of ~30 years. I think the more important question, and it's assumptive to think the monkey-calorie study answers it, is: Does a reduced calorie diet mean a human being will live longer, given that the leading causes of death are completely different in humans and monkeys? You and I have a completely different set of challenges then a monkey does, so the mechanisms we need to employ for our health are likewise very different. For all the primary causes of death except for nephritis, exercise has been shown to seriously reduce your chances of ending up with one of them (it even addresses depression which is linked to suicide). For Alzheimer's (2010 study): 

I've been squatting for several years and have done regional level competitions and some quasi-formal training and coaching. Normally I can get any additional answers I need from other fitness friends books by guys like Pendlay and Rippetoe. Recently I've started getting a pain-less popping sensation in my adductor magnus area. No idea if that's the muscle it's really coming from, but it's in the triangle between my hamstring, adductor, and glute, one just one side. It feels a bit like some muscles are moving around on top of each other. It doesn't happen constantly, it doesn't hurt, and it doesn't seem to affect anything. It only happens in the bottom of the squat ("the hole"). Does anyone have any references to a common fitness injury or mobility issue that could be going on?
