Once they'd gone up the Channel the only way back was round the North of Scotland and down the West coast of Ireland. The winds and currents around the British Isles say that this is the only way to do this. Effectively you can't sail the other way round as there are strong currents round Dover, and you need a ship capable of a certain minimum speed to actually make it round the point and into the Channel even if the wind is with you. You can also look at the historic transatlantic routes which follow much the same sort of pattern as this follows the prevailing winds and currents as shown in the maps below. Source Currents 

Orwell wrote a fairly terrifying state in 1984, but a lot of the technologies referred to are now obsolete or redundant, though other factors are still perfectly valid. Telescreens: These are now redundant. We each carry a little spy in our pocket that can listen wherever we are and track our movements. We no longer need to regulate to have a telescreen on in our house as someone in the room will always have a mobile phone turned on. Two minutes hate: It's hard to tell the difference between this and a Trump rally, but it's about uniting the people in adversity, telling everyone that the enemies are still out there and they must accept the bad things to keep them safe. Children informing on their parents: This was a side plot leading to the downfall of the neighbour. Taking away the children and turning them against their parents is still perfectly valid and still terrifying. Now we have new factors though Overwhelming marketing: How much of what you do or think is controlled by what's broadcast through your telescreen? We all like to think that we think for ourselves but for how many of us is that actually true? Misinformation: A lie runs around the world before the truth can get its boots on. Even faster with a good clickbait tagline on social media. Who needs the heavy hand of control when you can just tell people a pretty story and have them believe anything you like. Security cameras: There are various figures about being seen by 300 security cameras a day. This is an old figure for London, it may or may not be true but it means your day to day movements are now easily tracked. Those cameras are mostly linked to networked computers. Anything that's on the net can be watched centrally. Where I'm going with all this, is that the crude old methods of informing on every little crime, and making people suspicious of each other, leaving them constantly in fear are not required with modern technologies. It's far simpler and easier to use the technology that we accept and want day to day against us and if someone complains, just write them off as a crank. Everyone thinks they live in the best of all possible worlds and even keeps reelecting their leaders from the same cabal as they always have. In practice Orwell was wrong, Huxley was right, but Orwell is the one we remember. Huxley wrote Brave New World, also dystopian but rather than being oppressed by power, the people are controlled by pleasure. Enjoy your "reality" TV. 

These people are not lazy unfit modern people. Their primary transport is walking in an age when you walked or stayed home. This means that their baseline of physical fitness is higher than ours. Their required gear is considerably more basic than ours. We'd carry changes of clothes, cooker and fuel, tent, sleeping bag etc. etc. that these people wouldn't even think of. Sleep under a tree with maybe a bedroll, (folding) hide pot for cooking, firelighting equipment, bow for hunting. Terrain is against them, no modern or Roman roads to speak of, uneven ground, forests can be surprisingly open at ground level, or totally impenetrable due to undergrowth. Occasional forest fires and browsing animals will keep this clear, depends on your environment. If it's clear then an open forest can be very easy soft ground to walk for miles at a time. Modern experience (personal), we used to do 50miles in 4 days in wild country carrying full kit (1/3 body weight) while being experienced but not especially fit city teenagers. We did this in the knowledge that we could have covered that distance much faster without load, easily two days even on that terrain. Hostiles are possibly irrelevant. You're talking about an age with a much lower population density, once you're a day's walk from a town you're unlikely to see anyone unless you're on a direct route to the next town and even then merchants and highwaymen only. People didn't travel much, soldiers would be on the roads not in the back country, highwaymen would be on the roads to find targets, no point being in the back country. The adventures will come at the river, the rest is just a lot of walking. Estimates: If they want to make a route march of it and get lucky hunting: 9 days or fewer. Steady walking with a little time to gather food: 12-15 days. The river This is actually the biggest problem, it could add several days to find a crossing. They probably can't swim, there probably isn't a ford, there won't be a boat unless they find a town which I get the feeling they're avoiding. They'll have to follow the river a considerable distance to find a suitable place to cross, the first crossing inland from the sea will almost certainly have a town or village. Depending on avoidance of others/country/terrain/river width/speed/etc. add 1-6 days just to cross the river. As an example, Harwich and Felixstowe* are port towns on the English East coast. They're a few hundred meters apart. To travel from one to the other without a boat is over 30miles, even using the new Orwell bridge. Without a crossing a river is an impassible barrier. n.b. For a modern hiker on a known trail: The Pennine Way, 268 miles, can be done in around 3 weeks with no particular hurry, carrying full kit. *Arbitrarily selected because I know the towns not for any other particular reason, I'm sure there are equivalents requiring far longer detours. 

We are the Borg. Your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own. Resistance is futile. It's a world so unlike our own that there's no comparison. The closest would be the Borg (Star Trek) or Gaia (Foundation). The whole planet effectively becomes a single collective consciousness. All technology is available to all people, all thoughts and ideas, (all bank details,) all grand plans. Going to school would be pointless, you already have access to all the knowledge. No social media, no radio, maybe television/theatre, but possibly no verbal communication at all. Why use words when an image in the mind is so much more efficient. There would be live performances. People able imagine the most detailed worlds and stories would train to give public performances surrounded by people "listening" while anyone could tune in to the performance itself the experience would be greatly amplified and intensified by being surrounded by hundreds of other people sharing the same experience and thinking the same thoughts. 

In a civilisation that has achieved type 2, this will be the primary purpose of religion. Consider the scale of a society that has achieved that level, and the struggle to maintain an identity within those masses, something to say that "I am unique" within this vast sea of people. Religion gives a culture that you're born to, a set of customs that set you apart from the masses of the worlds and mark your membership of a smaller group that Dunbar's number is more capable of understanding. 

The method you use for directing the antimatter as a weapon and the method you use for defending against it are going to be closely linked. The simple answer being: What works for the weapon will work for defence. Somehow you have to manipulate the antimatter into a beam, quickly directed or redirected to use as a weapon, without it colliding with the inside of the weapon itself. Whatever method you use for that will equally work to defend another vessel against the beam itself. At the technological point where antimatter can be used as a weapon, it can equally be defended against. The trick is going to be that nobody would believe you'd use a weapon with such a high risk to your own ship and hence wouldn't have defences against it. This only works once. 

The psychological approach is the only way, you'll have to get her through friends and family, the direct approach is a dead loss. 

Eugenics was all the rage until someone tried it In the early part of the 20th Century the concept was very popular with the European intellectual elite. To start running it in your own country without undue protest you need to start by turning the people against each other. If your society is not homogeneous, blame one section of it for the over population and any other problems your society may have. Create a law to force those members of your society to wear a clear visible marking, a green crescent on their arm perhaps, maybe a yellow star. I shouldn't really need to say more than this, you all know where it's going. 

I'm going to challenge the basic premise on the grounds that you've already lost the war. Air superiority is key, if you control the airspace you can control the ground. If you ground troops are worrying about rods from god, you've lost air superiority and probably lost the war. Your air/space superiority forces should be handling this by keeping the appropriate orbits clear of vessels capable of launching such weapons. Don't track the projectiles, track the launchers. The launchers are going to be large, slow moving and fairly obvious. There's no point trying to track a bullet, even one fired from such a range that you've got 5mins or so to impact. By the time you've detected the launch, located the projectile and identified the course, determined and communicated a safe direction for the troops to move in, it's probably too late to get out of the impact zone, especially if they've fired a spread centred on your location. Let the flyboys handle the flying stuff, the grunts should be worrying only about what's on (or near) the ground. 

Yes and No Would you believe this occurs at a predictable time every day in the UK? During the break at the end of popular soap operas a significant percentage of the population of the UK puts the kettle on. Total load spike on the system can reach 3GW, equivalent to approximately 1.8kW load per household for around 1.75 million kettles at almost exactly the same moment1. This is a known factor and you can set your watch by the power surges relating to it. Power stations are on standby, more power is made available in France to cover the spike. However this is a known effect at a known time and the system is geared up to cope with it. Dropping a 3GW load onto the national grid without preparation would likely knock large sections out. 1BBC video source probably not available outside the UK 

This depends on how big your territories are going to be, we use country as a fairly arbitrary word to define a politically defined area. We imply that it means more than that but ultimately it doesn't. You could have any of the following, some more strictly defined than others: 

Fire already having been covered, I'm going to pick a secondary but important factor. Storms Under deep water storms just roll over and pass you by, even the mighty tsunamis are just a ripple on the surface, but once you get into shallower waters all hell breaks loose, and the destructive power of water comes into its own. This means that if a tribe moves into shallow waters for any reason, they'd be better off carrying on up and building on land instead. 

It won't take long to change from one to the other. Excessive movement of people puts excess load on the system, it means the logistics become complicated, the government won't know where to send resources causing waste in a system that must be efficient. The system must know where everyone is, people should stay where they're put. 

The enemy's gate is down While we know that in practice it would all be drones and allow no manual control, a story needs a hero and pilots make good heroes. However as anyone who's played asteroid will tell you, even in two dimensions controlling flight with 0 resistance is a fairly difficult thing to do. That's where pilot aids come in. Let the AI/autopilot or other similar system handle stability control. A feedback system from the joystick that maintains rotation while there's pressure and stops it when the joystick is released. Gryroscopes can track the actual angles involved, that's a very basic technology, the computer fires the thrusters to stabilise the movement. The pilot just needs to point and shoot. This of course requires a switch to disable it for plot reasons. You'd be mad to disable it in practice, but the hero can cope, otherwise he's no hero. There are multiple options here, you can have it accept lateral movement, correct lateral movement, accept or correct lateral movement only on command. All of these have advantages in a theoretical fight. Spin/tumble should always be corrected unless the pilot disables it. Additional notes More thrusters fewer weapons 6 thrusters only handles lateral, you need off axis thrusters to handle rotation. 6 clusters of 4 or 5 thrusters will do it. If the ship has weapons in all directions, there's no need for the pilot to handle complex maneuvers. A bit of hand waving to limit his arc of fire to something along the primary axis of his ship.
