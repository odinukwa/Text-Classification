I also faced the exact same problem. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be that many online resources for this field, and the existing ones aren't really that good (e.g. the one by Leiden University, like many other MOOCs, is just way too superficial and brief). My suggestion is just to find good textbooks and read them. When there wasn't any MOOC online, programmers also learned a lot, by reading good materials. In fact I'd say they're likely to be more reliable than MOOCs in a lot of aspects, since top-quality MOOCs are really few, but you can pretty much guarantee that textbooks widely used and reviewed are written with care. Here are two that I personally have used: 

You can surely find other books by searching online. Of course you might argue that those resources aren't free. But I guess you have to realize that the current proliferation of free materials in programming is really not a norm yet in many other fields. And even in programming, to find really good materials you usually have to pay anyways. 

I'd say this (names indicating gender) might actually be quite a western-centric phenomenon and I'm not sure whether it's even mainstream in the world. It's totally possible that more cultures give genderless names than not. It's just that when names are transcribed into western alphabets, western people won't be able to tell what they originally meant anyways, so they still suppose that gender-specific names as such in their culture are the norm. Coming to think of it, it's actually very weird for us Chinese to see that in western societies 1. there are strict distinctions between male names and female names which are not to be easily violated by social norms and 2. once a female gets married to a male, she changes her surname. Such things never happen in China. And also, your example about Japanese is largely incorrect. While the suffixes you listed are indeed common male/female names, there are also a whole lot of names which are neutral in the same manner as in Chinese. I'd say actually in modern Japan the later case might even be much more than the previous case. One funny historical fact is that during the sengoku period, there was a female lord named 井伊直虎(Ii Naotora), with 直虎 being a totally male and "strong" name (虎 is "tiger"). Well I guess the situation of this question(so many upvotes) reflects the fact that the majority of people here on SE are still westerners then :P 

This might not be directly what you were looking for, but if you're interested in the "names" for numerals, one thing I think might be valid is the point of "discrimination", i.e. because the numbers are all quite frequently used in daily conversations, people need to discriminate them as distinctly as possible. This is similar to the role played by genders in gendered languages. Thus you might observe that the pronunciations of the basic number words from 1 to 10 are mostly very distinct in most languages and they're not easy to be confused together. Maybe the true "origin" of those names can be a bit random, but the point is, through the evolution they must be as distinct from each other as possible. This was the theory of one of our professors anyways and you may go to his blog for detailed expositions. $URL$ $URL$ 

Adjuncts are stackable. Complements not so. Although one exception is ditransitive verbs which take two complements. 

You may look at deep learning approaches in general. This would be similar to what "reading comprehension tasks" are trying to achieve. Search for some papers and you shall find related ones, for example the paper "A Thorough Examination of the CNN/Daily Mail Reading Comprehension Task" at $URL$ There is also a paper list from a course I just had the last semester: $URL$ which you might find helpful. 

I'm on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and the Praat version is 6.0.04. Strangely I couldn't find any result on Google and it seems that I'm the only one who's encountering this issue? 

Apparently, "eu" is the subject in "eu gosto (de isso)" while "me" is the object in "me gusta (algo)". Why such a difference between two languages? What's the historical evolution of this expression? 

Some time has passed since the original question. For people looking at this question now, I'd say "Computational Linguistics" certainly encompasses more researches related to humanities, such as historical linguistics. A parallel would be the computational approaches employed in sociology or history research - Fundamentally they are still sociology and history nonetheless. "NLP" is much more closely related to computer science. Especially now in 2017, NLP is almost exclusively about how deep learning helps with various practical tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation etc. Another illustration of the matter would be that NLP is mostly a research direction under various Computer Science departments, especially in the US, while many "Computational Linguistics" research is actually under the Linguistic department/Philosophy faculty and the degree program confers a Bachelor of Arts degree, especially in many European universities. Of course the boundary might not be that clear and many universities which offer Computational Linguistics degrees have long been involved in more "NLP-esque" aspects of research as well and have been hiring professors with CS background. But the above generalization still applies. 

Sorry if this question sounds a bit basic. I haven’t had a solid grounding in phonology/phonetics yet so I am a bit confused about these concepts. We’re trying to build a model which studies certain properties of tonal languages. I understand that a vowel can be generally represented by four formant frequencies. However, I’m now trying to add tone into the representation, and I’m a bit confused by the relation between formant frequencies and pitch frequency. In the following picture from Praat which shows four tones of Chinese, it seems that the numbers in black on the left are for formant frequencies (represented with red lines), while the numbers in blue on the right are for pitch frequency (represented with blue lines). 

I think what you're searching information over is Inflectional Morphology First I'm not sure the idea that "it just seems to be taken for granted that tense is expressed by modifying the verbs." is very valid. If ever somebody made this claim there would be a lot of Eurocentrism in there. This claim might be true for a huge number of Indo-European languages and also fusional languages but it might not stand at all for a variety of other languages, ancient/Mandarin Chinese being an obvious example. Basically, there is this (perhaps incomplete) classification of "isolating" vs. "fusional" vs. "agglutinative" languages. Citing Wikipedia (apparently not the best source but it still provides some information), an "isolating" language by definition "is a type of language with a very low morpheme per word ratio and no inflectional morphology whatsoever. In the extreme case, each word contains a single morpheme." I suggest you find some materials in that direction. Simply searching for materials on "isolating language" should give you a lot of what you're looking for. This entry on WLAS might also be useful. In any case, there doesn't seem to be a pre-established reason why inflectional morphology must exist. A lot of missing language features in one language compared with another can be well covered by some other mechanisms. For example, in German there is no gerund, but it doesn't stop people from being able to express the idea of something happening right now.
