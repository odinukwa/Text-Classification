Prior to the turn of the last century, it was nearly universally believed that scientific theories could be proven in the same way as theorems in mathematics could. The surprising collapse of Newtonian mechanics, Newtonian gravity, and classical electrodynamics caused philosophers to realize that no amount of verification can lead to a guarantee that the next experiment won't produce a null result. Karl Popper recognized that theories were indeed not provable, but maintained that they (or at least the good ones) were falsifiable. This idea is still deeply entrenched in popular opinion and is still commonly offered as a solution to the problem of demarcation. However, the claim that scientific theories are falsifiable does not hold up under scrutiny. 

I think you might be confusing determinism with what’s called ‘chaos.’ Chaotic systems are deterministic, nonlinear systems, which are characterized as ‘chaotic’ because of their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. ‘Nonlinear,’ just means that they can be described by nonlinear differential equations. The so-called ‘butterfly effect’ is a colorful way of illustrating this. Nonlinear systems can be so sensitive to initial conditions that differences in how two computers handle floating point rounding errors can result in wildly different computational outcomes. This leads to a general inability to accurately predict nonlinear behavior, which can lead to confusion between chaotic and random systems . In practice, there may be no meaningful distinction, but in theory, chaotic systems are completely deterministic, whereas random systems (such as a quantum mechanical measurement) are taken to be fundamentally nondeterministic—meaning that the outcome is fundamentally not determined by the initial conditions. 

The only conclusion you can draw is that just as you can not prove scientific theories, you also cannot disprove or falsify them either. A 'proven' theory might turn out to be wrong just as a 'falsified' theory might turn out to be correct in some way we could never imagine at the time. 

While I really like Virmaior's answer, I would like to add a few points, mainly regarding the ideas of verifiability and falsifiability as they relate to scientific theories. 

There is a strong hostility toward theistic views in academic science. I read a poll about ten years ago that indicated that the majority of scientists in academia identified as atheists; among the most elite, that number jumped to something like 98%. I can't find the poll now, but my experience has been consistent with this. It didn't use to be this way; for example, Descartes and Newton were both Christians, and both men viewed science as a way to explore God's creation. In their time, science and religion were commonly seen as being perfectly compatible. In my opinion, the shift from theistic to atheistic was cultural and not a scientific; I.e. there is not an experiment we can do to determine God's existence. However, the scientific atheist will strongly disagree with this and will posit that their worldview is in fact supported by science--or at least that it is the more scientific view. It is this strong belief (that their worldview is supported by science) that, in my opinion, leads to the hostility you note. 

It's not clear what a scientific position is. So let's replace 'position' with 'theory' so that the discussion is clearer. Requiring that a scientific theory not contradict any other scientific theory is definitely not a criterion of science. If it were, we would be in really bad shape. New theories always contradict those they replace. This is how science progresses. Furthermore, I would suggest the following principle: If X is a scientific theory or hypothesis, then it's antithesis (~X) is also a scientific theory or hypothesis. Note that I'm not saying that they are both equally good. I'm just saying it doesn't make sense to say that claim $X$ is scientific, but ~X is not scientific. This principle is especially important in consideration of the percentage of scientific theories that have turned out to be wrong. 

Dawkins, I'm sure, is making this connection through his reductive materialistic worldview: I.e. he assumes the truth of reductive materialism, which implies that personal identity must supervene on the physical—i.e. the body—which is an expression of your genetic code: similar to positing that a copy of a computer program is the same program. This is not my view, just what I imagine Dawkins would say if challenged. In general, however, I think the problem of personal identity is much harder than Dawkins assumes in the above passages. Consider the following questions: 

Where does my personal identity from? Why should there be such a thing as personal identity in the universe at all? If we consider the continuum of matter, why should some clumps within the continuum have specific personal identities? Why am I me and not someone else? 

Randomness refers to physical processes only. Mathematical identities like 1 + 1 = 2 are independent of any physical property or process and would be true even if the physical universe were to disappear. The debate over determinism is centered about whether the entire universe is deterministic; if it is, then determinism is true; if it is not, then determinism is false. For determinism be false, there only needs to be some nondeterministic process out there. We don't need to go so far as to claim everything is random—and we definitely don't want to start positing the instability of mathematical truths! 

Most historians of philosophy mark the beginning of science and philosophy at 585 BC when Thales of Miletus predicted an eclipse and claimed everything was made of water. From that point until about the 18th century, science was considered a branch of philosophy. ‘Natural philosophy,’ as you noted. Physics was the first area of research to formally break off from philosophy, and psychology was the most recent. Generally, when a branch of scientific research becomes sufficiently mature (or rather successful), it will break away from philosophy—or at least that is how the process is commonly described. Thomas Kuhn describes science as being organized into paradigms. Paradigms allow researchers to assume a certain common framework and avoid fundamental arguments of a more metaphysical nature. In this description, the breaking-away process can be thought of as the result of the formation of a paradigm. Before the formation of a paradigm there is massive disagreement at the most fundamental levels; after the formation of a paradigm, the answers to basic questions have been assumed, and researchers are now focused on filling in the details (at which point they get their own department). 

If you drop the word 'experimental' from your question, then Pythagoras is probably the closest you'll get. He believed everything was made of numbers. A close second would be Plato who believed mathematics to be the key to understanding the world. Both men might take issue with your term 'experimental science,' as they thought science was a purely mental activity. 

seems correct. But in the next part, he appears to equate personal identity with a specific genetic combination: 

Suppose there was another human out there with DNA identical to mine, I would hardly want to say that that person was me. Suppose my DNA were to change due to a virus (or radiation or simple copying error—something that has most likely already happened), surely that would not change who I was. 

Supporting Details As Thomas Kuhn points out, in his book 'The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,' the scientific community will go to great lengths to prevent an accepted theory from being falsified. Take the famous example of the observation of perturbations in planet Uranus' orbit, which were not predicted by Newtonian mechanics. These discrepancies between observation and theory were known for nearly 70 years. As Kuhn points out, the scientific community does not reject a theory the first time there is a null result. In the case of the orbit of Uranus, the scientific community, rather than rejecting Newtonian mechanics and Newton's law of gravity, instead hypothesized the existence of a yet undiscovered planet: Neptune. They even calculated the exact location where the new planet would have to exist in order to explain the inconsistencies, which lead to the discovery of Neptune—a great achievement for Newtonian physics. However, never during that 70 year period (between the discovery of the discrepancy and the discovery of Neptune) did the scientific community ever consider rejecting Newtonian mechanics. A few years after that, the existence of the planet Vulcan was hypothesized to explain persistent irregularities in the orbit of Mercury (irregularities that had first been observed a century earlier). However, unlike Neptune, the planet Vulcan was never discovered, and Mercury's orbit was only explained after Einstein published his theory of general relativity in 1916. A third example, from antiquity, was the inclusion of epicycles by Ptolemy in the Aristotelian system of astronomy to account for irregularities in the observed orbit of the planets. All three of these examples highlight the scientific communities ability to defend a theory in the face of inconsistent experimental data. The point of these three examples is to show that the scientific community can always tweak the theory or tweak auxiliary hypotheses (i.e posit a yet undiscovered planet) in the face of incongruent data. Moreover, even when a theory is 'falsified,' there is no guarantee that it won't come back to life a century later. Take, for example, the particle (corpuscular) theory of light, which was supposedly falsified in 1819 when the French physicist Dominique-François-Jean Arago observed a bright spot at the center of the shadow of a circular disk (a bizarre prediction of Fresnel's wave-theory put forth to discredit the theory). Resistance to the wave theory collapsed and by all accounts, the particle theory of light was completely and utterly destroyed. However, fast-forward to 1905, and the particle theory is resurrected by Albert Einstein to explaining the photoelectric effect and ultraviolet catastrophe. The point is that the scientific community can always explain away a null result by challenging one or more of the auxiliary hypotheses, and/or by adjusting the theory to account for the results. And even if the scientific community agrees that a theory is falsified, it still might be resurrected at some point in the future new and unforeseen reasons. Conclusion
