I use an Altura pannier (or both if I'm caring a lot and need the full 46 capacity), and a detachable shoulder strap that I keep in the top pocket of the pannier. It's on the bike most of the time, but when I need to take it off and carry it round the strap is always there handy, and the rixen & kaul fittings make the pannier easy to attach/detach. It's not quite as comfortable as a dedicated over-the-shoulder-bag (sometimes the pannier clips can get in the way as I'm walking about), but it's definitely good enough for what I need. 

In wet conditions, my current brakes are pretty poor. Without switching to disc brakes, what are my options for v-brake pads that work better in the wet? I'm only thinking about this for my commuting bike, which is mostly a flat ride to and from work. But sometimes the rain can get pretty heavy this time of year. 

I would add to the already existing answers some of the thoughts that come to me as a bike user. For me using a bicycle is a mean to prevent getting out of shape. Using an electrical bike would be like going hiking with a car or elevator. This applies for a lot of my friends riding bikes. Some of my colleagues complimented me on the fact that I exercise daily by riding to work. In the same register, I expect the opposite reaction for riding an electrical bike, as it would point the user out as a lazy/weak person, unwilling/unable to do any effort. Not saying it's true or right to be judged, but people often live by what others think about them (the coolness factor). you may get coolness points in the gadget section, but it's a different group of people that will compliment you on that. So it depends on where you want to position yourself. A cheap bicycle is something you can easily toss in some corner when reaching a destination (edit: and of course diligently chain it up), without too much worry regarding theft. Can't do the same (with peace of mind) with an electrical bike. Depending on where you live, using a cheap (second-hand, maybe) bicycle for two to three months already pays for the bike itself, by saving on transport costs. With an electrical bike, there is a steep initial investment, and the ROI is spread over a much longer term. Electrical bikes are heavy and not so easy to maneuver in tight spaces where you need to carry them (like stairs). If they are light usually they are very expensive. Finally there is the same concern as for electrical cars: will the charge last for the whole trip? If not, you'll have to pedal-drive a lot of additional mass accounting for the motor and battery. 

Note: I finally found the relevant article, so I'm editing my first answer. According to the article R431-7 of the French "Code de la route": 

I'm currently designing the "electric bike of my dream" (please do not laugh! it's for fun, nothing serious), and I came up after some though with a tricycle, where 2 rear wheels are supporting the battery and cargo weight, and a suspended front part for the rider. The simplified kinematic of the bike is the following: 

The link between the front part (in blue and red) and the rear part (in orange and green) would be made by two rotations: R1 for suspension, R2 to be able to move the front part sideways when making a turn. The rear part is supposed to stay vertical (well, more or less perpendicular to the road anyway). My question is about the suspension part, and its influence on the "rideability" of the bike. I was thinking of putting two suspensions (SL and SR) to provide some positive "feedback" on R2 when making a turn, and to make the front part stay vertical when parked. On paper this looks nice, but I was thinking that this may be a problem when: 

While I'm not sure this qualifies as an answer, because with such questions there is usually a lot of guessing, your issue sounds like a flexing issue or a worn rear-hub. The flexing could happen because of your weight (maybe fatigued frame? or just flexible) resulting in slightly changed geometry while riding vs suspended mount. A worn rear hub could cause a wobbling or light tilting in the cassette while under load. I would also check the cables while the bike is mounted on the stand and see that the clamps or the bike position (handlebars sitting at a hard angle, pulling on cables) are not somehow affecting the tension in the derailleur cable. 

Here is a suggestion that might help with your troubleshooting. It might be the b-tension screw that needs to be adjusted. If you say the noise appears under tension, check if the g-pulley (upper pulley) on your derailleur is somehow rubbing the largest gears in the back the wrong way :) Here's a video tutorial on adjusting the b-tension screw. Another suggestion that comes to my mind is that the derailleur arm could possibly give under tension and bend to the right or to the left, causing the shifting to be imprecise and rubbing the sprockets. This could happen because of a to short chain or bad derailleur (having play). This one is also easy to check, by looking at the rear sprockets when the noise is present (should be done on a bike stand). 

I'm consider getting bicycle rollers for use over winter, and I expect after the initial newness has worn off it might become boring. Can I realistically watch a DVD while using rollers? Or do they take too much concentration, and I should look at getting something like a fluid trainer instead? 

I have an HTC Hero, which is a great phone, but the battery life is pretty poor if I'm using the GPS and music player on it as well. The phone uses a mini-USB connection for charging, and I have a Powermonkey portable charger just in case my phone runs out of juice. But for longer rides, the extra charge and a half I get from the Powermonkey might not be enough - what other good options do I have? Either to charge the phone, or the Powermonkey, when cycling. 

Insulation tape. In multiple colors to suggest a really bad taste, as opposed to single color conspicuously hinting at a bike that's been intentionally uglified. Adding some rusty bits and pieces from the other bike would help. I'd say also remove panniers, or any accessories that scream "quality". There are sticker glue removal solutions in stores. I've been using some cleaning solutions normally used in furniture manufacture for cleaning up marker writings, excess hardened glue and stickers from the final product before shipping. Stickers instead of insulation tape have the downside that, being made of paper, they don't come off in one piece, making them even harder to peel off cleanly. Further adding some really ugly (cheap, cracked) mudguards could contribute to the overall cheap feeling. 

Something to take care of is the increase in influence from side winds, and a small increase in aerodynamic drag. I used to bike in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, which is often a bit windy, and you can immediately feel the difference riding with and without panniers. However the net effect from side wind can be overall positive; as with sail-boat, depending on the shape of your panniers, aerodynamic drag with side wind can be smaller than without. You can optimize the shape of your panniers by carefully filling them. It can be sometimes fun to have to manage your bike stability in strong wind. See this video to see an example :) 

The feedback force and behavior would depend on the choice of d and h as seen on the diagram (h can be made negative if needed). Another (probably simpler) solution is to only have one suspension in place of SL and SR, w/o any "feedback" couple. What would be better in your opinion? Does a small feedback for R2 would render the bike not rideable? As a bonus some "artist" views to get the whole picture (on the rear view you see only one suspension): 

I switched to using Specialized Armadillo a while ago because of frequent punctures, and I haven't had any since making the switch. I'd highly recommend them. 

Use your phone to take a photo of your bike location, being sure to get some easy to find landmarks in the photo as well. E.g. if you had just taken the photo above and your bike is the front centre one, those two trees should be fairly easy to find again when you come back. If it still takes a while to find (or the search area is very big) and your phone has GPS, you can probably tag the photo with the location as well. 

Mine stays on my bike all the time. After I clean/fill it, I put it back on my bike. I do run the risk of forgetting to fill it up, but the worst that's happened so far is that I've ended up with half a bottle of day old water. Which is much better than no water :) 

Given the number of rainy days in the Netherlands, just keep your bike outside for a few days :) No seriously, I lived several years in Amsterdam, and never ever washed my bikes. Dutch style would be to bring down a bucket from your flat and wash your bike with a cloth or a sponge and water from the nearest canal. In my little experience washing too hard a bike is usually counter-productive. If the bike is correctly designed it will withstand lots of mud. Just keeping the chain clean from sand is usually sufficient. 

It's not really clear if that imply you have to stay on the right of the road, but according to the second paragraph it would make sense to draw this conclusion. However, especially in France, there is the official law and the less-official customs, which can be quite different from each other sometimes. From my personal experience of both living in France and riding a bicycle, staying in the middle of the lane with cars behind you is the surest manner to make the driver loose his patience and start trying to do crazy things, like driving few centimeters close to your back wheel. So I would not advise it. But keeping a safe distance between your path and the right side of the road, such as around 1 meter, is what most riders do.

It's cross-referenced and you can search on the text. Obviously it's in French :)
