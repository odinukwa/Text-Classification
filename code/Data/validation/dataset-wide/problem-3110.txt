I'm assuming that you truly are interested in this research so I will be forthright in my answer below. First, I think it should be obvious why you cannot find information that satisfies your research hypothesis. The short answer is real historians normally do not drink the kool-aid of political ideology. Second, this question assumes the generally accepted confrontation of North vs South Vietnam is correct. Cold War propaganda is how I will term it. 

So, in sum, the Mongol Navy had no significant achievement to speak of, unlike their land-based army. But it did exist: 

NOTE: The author of this article is Condrea DRĂGĂNESCU (from University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Bucharest,59 Marasti, District 1, 011464, Bucharest, Romania). He has written quite a few articles on Corkscrew Wallachian. Another with specific discussion on taxonomy and the Corkscrew Wallachian is A note on Balkan sheep breeds origin and their taxonomy) (pdf). And this paper for the name Corkscrew Valachian (same author, pdf). 

Allow me to digress and point out, with particular focus on Ivan's enemies on the Ugra River in 1480, the so-called Mongols ... again the details matter. The correct term should be Tartar-Mongols (also known as the Great Horde, and not to be confused with Golden Horde of the Jochids). The importance of this distinction will be explained in a moment. 

CONCLUSION In other words, it was an origin myth - the Dorians were created after the collapse. By the way, Cline does not bring up the Dorians again (i.e. after dismissing their role in the collapse - as per quote above). 

Therefore, no -- there is no animosity between Cantonese-speakers and Mandarin-speakers, but there are debates and to term it as "animosity" is a stretch and stereotyping the North-South divide. However, there is a cultural divide between Northern and Southern China, from ancient history to today. 

(I do not know if this is an answer but having read OP's profile, he seems to be trying to get with the program of SE, so I will try to help.) 

Q: How come Thutmose III's army was not seen by the people in Megiddo? The Egyptian army took 7 hours for the last man in the army to pass the mountain! Answer: Apparently, it was 12 hours. They weren't seen because there was no one guarding the middle pass (because it was unlikely Thutmose would use this pass, the most dangerous). 

Port Moresby The Japanese invasion (and intended occupation) of Port Moresby was abandoned. The official name by the Japanese was Operation MO. The Wikipedia explanation shows a few possible reasons why it was aborted but it has no mention of Admiral Inoue of the Fourth Fleet, who was in charge of Japanese Base Air Forces (for the intended occupation of Port Moresby). The details are quite complex so I will only reference involvement of Admiral Inoue's in Operation MO here, in battle order of Battle of Coral Sea (which has a reference to Operation MO). There was tussle between him, Yamamoto and IGHQ (see OP's comments below). 

Please allow me to say that my answer tries to address this in terms of history, not political values. I am not Viet and no, Vietnam today does not separate itself into South Vietnam vs North Vietnam. It is simply Vietnam. 

I am writing this because I believe the Wikipedia article on Turko-Mongol tradition does not really help readers understand the concept, which gave rise to this question (my assumption). Also, (perhaps) this question stems from a confusion between genetics (biology) and genealogical relationship (linguistics). If that is the case, this article on language family might help clarify: genetic relationship (linguistics). Having said this, the answer given by T.E.D. is correct insofar that the proposed Altaic language family is now discredited because, if the hypohtesis is true, earlier forms of Turkic and Mongolic language should be more related (linguistically, not biologically) than later forms. Instead, comparative linguistics has shown that, in fact, "the earliest written records of Mongolic and Turkic languages shows fewer similarities rather than more, which suggests that they do not share a common ancestor, but rather have become more similar through language contact and areal effects. Because of this, most modern linguists do not accept the Altaic family". Source Again, back to T.E.D.'s answer, on his statement "the similarities are more due to long proximity than heritage" -- this is areal effects. So, in fact, the present day similarities of Turkic and Mongolic languages is due to a long period of contact and was expedited by Mongolian expansionist policy, which gave rise to Turko-Mongol tradition (14th century). To end, here's a paragraph from Turko-Mongol Relations (chapter twenty-one of The Mongolic Languages, Routledge, 2003): 

Ashoka of Mauryan Emprire Ashoka (son of Bindusara) would be the start of Buddhism in Gandhara. He was a significant emperor of the Mauryan Empire (322 BCE - 185 BCE). This period is much earlier than the Ghaznavid Empire (975 CE - 1187 CE). 

Therefore, it should be clear (to me anyway), Oğuric Turks arrived in Western Asia from Eastern Asia (i.e. in other words, they migrated). And to define them simply as "Oghur (western) and Common Turkic (eastern) branches" is to ignore their origins. 

I believe it was a manner of speech to refer to children, born to royalty, with pre-destined roles. As your Penguin Monarchs series on Wiliam III and Mary II (2015) has it -- this quote is from Chapter 1, aptly titled "Children of State". The quote provided (in question) is from mid-paragraph. Here's the full paragraph (for viewers here who might not have the book and to flesh out the full context):

Based on FAO, I will use the name Corkscrew Walachian / Valachian, altho Wikipedia has it as Wallachian Sheep. Both quotes below are from Pastoralism And The Romanians History - People, Languages, Genes And The Local Sheep Breeds, In North-Eastern Black Sea Steppe (pdf), Scientific Papers Series Management, Economic Engineering in Agriculture and Rural Development, Vol.13, Issue 1, 2013. 

(I saw your other question on Qutuz's mud-slinging with Hulagu. So, I hope I don't blow your bubble here). Here goes: What did the Golden Horde get out of the alliance with Mamluks? Answer: They did not have one. The Mamluks claimed they had an alliance with the Golden Horde, but that's just it: a claim and a very long con by the Mamluks. Gives new (old?) meaning to the saying: Fake it till you make it! Baybars was just full of it because he was trying to cover up his slave background with an invented 'alliance' with Berke (of the Golden Horde). Like Qutuz (the other question), Baybars was a Qipchak Turk who was sold into slavery. Mamluk is Arabic for "property" or "slave" (depending on context). SOURCE: Anne F. Broadbridge, Kingship and Ideology in the Islamic and Mongol Worlds (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), p.58: 

SOURCE: Reuven Amitai-Preiss, 'Mongols and Mamluks: The Mamluk-Ilkhanid War, 1260–1281' (Cambridge, 1995), pp.79-80. The fact that Abaqha and troops could 'return back' tells us that Berke's army didn't finish them off. Remember, Jebe and Subotei chased the Shah (Muhammad II) to the Caspian Sea during the Khwarezm campaign. (I placed that additional paragraph there because of that famous quote -- just wanted to show the context of that quote). 

Stating the obvious, there were multiple causes of the French Revolution. One of it was the Assembly of the Notables, i.e. the French nobility. Hence, they were not quiet by-standers before or after the Revolution. Because of the lack of co-operation of Assembly of the Notables with the King -- as well squabbling among themselves -- the direct result was convening of Estate-General of 1789, which started the Revolution, i.e. 5th of May, 1789. 

In short, the social structure of Roman society was not to inter-mix with the barbrians of the provinces. Here is a speech by Claudius that did not go down well at the senate because he wanted to admit noble citizens of Gaul to the Senate: 

In case we need another confirmation that we are not imagining a link between Shakespeare's child of state and the political maneuvering of his time, Wikipedia's entry on this sonnet has this (2nd paragraph): 

Trincomalee, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) was the base of Royal Navy's Eastern Fleet during WW2. In 1942, after losing Prince of Wales and Repulse, the Eastern Fleet retreated to Trincomalee after the fall of Singapore. Not sure if this was Yamamoto's call, most likely not. Admiral Chuichi Nagumo’s 1st Air Fleet (5 carriers) - veterans of Pearl Harbour the previous year - conducted the raid against the Eastern Fleet's 'base'. They probably did not realise the RN Eastern Flett's new commander, Vice-Admiral Somerville had created a new base at Addu Atoll in the Maldive Islands, where the the Royal Air Force had a station -- RAF Gan. Historians, generally, didn't view positively the tactical decisions made by the Japanese during the Pacific War. Regardless if it was decision of Imperial General Headquarters, Yamamoto or Nagumo, the decision to strike at Trincomalee was in line with Imperial Japanese thinking of the time -- to capitalise on their success at Pearl Habour and expand the 'operational space' further by taking on (and taking out) the British Royal Navy. It doesn't mean, with hindsight, it makes a lot of sense but there were many decisions that did not make sense: 

The question, as is, covers a long period between Alexander (d. 323 BCE) and Mahmud of Ghazni (b. 975 CE) and the ethnic and religious influence changed extensively over the period of more than a 1000 years. So, I will focus on Gandhara during the early stages, immediately post-Alexander, and with particular emphasis on Buddhism (Gandhara was in the question title before subsequent modification). 

Ashoka's Legacy Ashoka's legacy is the spread of Buddhism, to Gandhara and the rest of the world - source: 

THE WEAPON: BOW AND ARROW Weapons have been used in Chinese martial arts from the time of Shang dynasty (c. 1600 to 1046 BCE), but it became much more prevalent during Zhou dynasty (c.1050-256 BCE). Ranged weapons were available - bows and arrows - but they were limited to aristocrats only because it was one of the higher forms of martial arts: 

"What was the church's attitude to supposed witches prior to the 15th century?" Answer: Exodus (22:18) says: “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.”

I'll try to answer the main (title) question, What is the origin of the Scythians? -- I am not qualified in linguistic classifications. The straight-forward answer is, as steppe nomads, they migrated west from Central Asia to West Asia (Pontic-Caspian steppe) -- their nomadic empire was given different names, Scythians (Greeks), Saka (Persian), etc. 

On the first question, ...is there any evidence of them expanding northeast towards the present-day petroplavlosk-kamchatsky area?, no -- I don't believe there is any evidence of Mongol empire stretching to Kamchatka. As a steppe society, I believe the Kamchatka Peninsula is way out of Mongol Empire's range of operation. But let's not leave it at that but expand on the point because they have tried (and failed miserably) to invade Java and Japan. Nevertheless, let's keep in mind, in history: lack of evidence is not evidence of absence ... As for the second question, ... were there factors that prevented them from expanding there?, I believe the following factors might be good reasons why they did not make it that far:
