which allows us to ignore the possibility of children being disowned and disinherited. But you also specified:

Discussion: Lagrange Points. In astronomy and orbital mechanics, Lagrange points are positions in an orbital configuration where an object remains fixed relative to the other bodies. Point 3 automatically removes typical orbital positions such as Low-Earth-Orbit and Geosynchronous-Earth-Orbits. This leaves the Lagrange points as a natural selection; but, there are 4 such points for Earth and The Moon and 4 more for Earth and The Sun. Earth-Moon Lagrange Points If we look at the Earth-moon system, L1 is a natural point to choose for the station. It's situated between Earth and The Moon with relatively quick access to either body and can observe Earth's full rotation with ease. That being said, L1 poses 2 issues: 

We have the technology to drill to Mars' core. We can produce any type of nuclear weapon in any quantity.

So how do we motivate the wealthy to raise more children? By looking at what currently motivates them and structure raising children as providing a similar benefit. In this case, they are very clearly motivated by a desire to pay less taxes. Therefore, Legislate tax breaks proportional to the number of kids raised. Write the legislation so that the amount of money saved from taxes per child is greater than the amount of money spent to care for each child per tax year. This creates a net-tax break. Structure the legislation so that raising more kids returns a greater tax break. More importantly: do not cap it leaving it uncapped maximizes the generational distribution of wealth. This creates a dangerous issue: exploitation How does one protect the children from malicious upperclassmen who intends to exploit them for financial gain? It would seem simple to legislate the following points: 1. Each child must be guaranteed a share of the inheritance. 2. Each child must be treated humanely (and this much be checked) 3. If the child dies or goes missing, formal investigations must be had. But, we're talking about the supremely wealthy and their armies of lawyers and accountants. Obviously, if they'd like to maximize their tax cut, they will be motivated to adopt a massive number of children. In the short term, this benefits them; however, in the long term, they may wish to keep their wealth and not distribute it after their death. Similarly, they may wish to keep the children at a manageable age to reduce costs and psychological overhead. Anecdotal example: rich teens invokes far more legal fees than rich 10 year olds. Or, they could sell the kids (ex: females) when they reach a certain age and make a tidy profit. Therefore, they may attempt to trade or remove kids from their parentage, be it adoption to another wealthy family, or 'mysterious disappearances' (read: murder, human-trafficking, slavery, prostitution). Without heavy government oversight, it would be simple for the obscenely wealthy and obscenely malicious to exploit lower-class adopters for financial gain. Similarly, one can see them forming the equivalent of a foster home. In essence, you'd be shifting the foster-care system to the wealthy; but, like the current foster care system, incredible oversight will be required to prevent exploitation. 

By the courtesy of the other dead I don't know if all cultures believe in souls ascending to heaven, so relying on your enemies in battle may not be wise. However, since not all your dead are trapped (those who are reachable can be helped), it could be a matter of courtesy in those cultures to not ascend the minute you are free, but have a look around, especially in times of war, for fellow souls which are trapped and free them before you go. Army units in particular can have it planned ahead that everyone who dies makes sure all the others are alive or descended. 

If we knew, we wouldn't need spells The thing about what we do to animals, is that we don't really know how they feel about it. Many people honestly say that they don't believe animals can suffer or feel pain, and that's why it's all justified. Others enjoy the benefit of the doubt. If we could speak to animals, we could know for sure how they feel and decide accordingly. A moving speech from a cow would probably make many people go vegan (others would argue that these animals wouldn't even be born if it wasn't for us needing them for food). If they turn out to be feeling-less, we would use them even more. So the real question is, what would they say. What would they say? I believe what they would say is exactly what they say now, in actions and demeanor. When my dog says "woof" I know what she means. It's not complex ideas, mostly emotions and basic needs. I doubt an animal would evolve the complex skills of symbolic thinking without being able to use it. I also highly doubt that they can express emotions without feeling them, as some think (I doubt that's even logically possible) So lab animals would probably say "I'm scared", "I'm in pain", "I don't like the person in the white coat" etc. Nothing we couldn't have guessed already. To conclude 

Of them I'll ignore the Parthians since I'm unfamiliar with their history. Romans BY 1 ADE the Roman Empire had been ruled by Augustus for 28 years. Following "The Transformation", city dwellers would panic over the size of vermin and rural citizens would panic over the size of their cattle or wild animals. The cities would calm rather quickly given the presence of Praetorian Guard, police, and fire fighting established by Augustus and the Roman Legionnaires of course (who happens to include rural farmers in their ranks). Given the large presence of weapons among the populace, I expect they'd make short work of any animals that happens upon them. Deaths by mauling or animal attacks would surely increase; but, this would motivate a systematic response from the Senate and Emperor. Given their technological prowess, I expect the Romans would construct walls to keep out larger animals. Unlike the Germanic tribes, the Romans would benefit from light sources, horses, roads, and steel/iron weapons. As such, the Germanic tribes would never become a threat to the Romans. Furthermore, given the different chain of events, it's debatable whether Augustus would die when he did (14 AD), especially if Livia did poison him. Considering the Roman Empire's existing domestication and distribution channels the Roman food supply would increase eightfold from meat sources and massively from agriculture (since agriculture would grow to compensate for the animal's increased diet). Furthermore, it's not a stretch to consider how quickly they'd attempt to tame said animals and use them for work or transportation. One of Rome's biggest technological issues was energy sources. With 'The Transformation', every animal they put to work would output 2-8x more energy. How far could a horse 2x taller and longer travel? Imagine how that would affect the Cursus Publicas (also implemented by Augustus)? How would this affect the ability to transport the materials needed to construct walls and aqueducts? This would be a very different Roman Empire without much of the limits that crippled it by 1000 AD. What is questionable though is the status of their outlying regions (Egypt, Anatolia, Phoenicia, Spain, France). Here I won't speculate (for the moment). China Unlike the Romans, the Chinese are a different beast. By 1 AD they'd mastered warfare and have strongly unified. With the onset of "The Transformation", they'd have the capacity for a rapid response. Since they were quite familiar with East Asia, they'd successfully wage a land war against the animals. I say this because they have strategy, steel weapons, and most importantly: crossbows. Where the Romans have numbers & organization, the Chinese armies would excel in the use of Sun Tzu's stratagems and the skillful application of weapons. Given the knowledge of Salt Peter and China's history of technological advancements during 'war' (namely the warring states period), I have no doubt that they'd develop gunpowder centuries ahead of time. Conclusion Yes, Humanity would survive; but, it'd be a vastly different world likely dominated by Rome & China. Further Questions 

Find someone with hindsight and a sketchy character Give them money Have them falsely confirm your alibi and blame the crime on someone else + discredit whoever is condemning you (including if it's the judge his/her self!) Maybe throw in some conspiracy theories for the hell of it Stall the trial, say "we just can't know for sure what happened! So many alternative facts!" Walk away happy as a clam 

Btw, sorry to nitpick but why would the planet-facing side of the moon be dark all the time? Just look at our moon, it's earth-facing side is almost always partially lit 

Edit: I added the tag to encourage out-of-the-box answers. I would accept some craziness for better results, although simplicity is preferred. (There isn't an actual study!) 

You don't know this, but in the program that is your consciousness there are break points. I.e., points in which the program stops, and you have a chance to reflect on it and perhaps change it. The way this works is that you suddenly have an out-of-body experience, in which you realize that time has stopped and you have an ability to change certain things about yourself (see details below). You know that once you 'resume' yourself you will forget that this ever happened, and you don't remember it ever happening before although you are aware it's possible that it had. What you can do: 

Suppose I'm a rich, well-connected psychological scientist with a lot of spare time, and I'm sick of WEIRD science. 

They are not really fire-proof Much like ruining a dishwasher with water, you can burn a dragon with fire - if you direct it to a weak spot. There's no reason why the outer belly of the dragon should be fire proof. Also, when it breathes fire, the fire doesn't stay close too long. It's most likely created outside the body. Fire is much more dangerous when someone pushes it at you. 

Aligned center of mass with parent. Matched rotational spin (specifically the precessional angular speed of the ring to Earth’s rotational angular speed). artificial gravity induced by centripetal acceleration. Stabilizers to prevent precession of the ring. Since the station is uniformly circular, its center of mass lies at the geometric center of the ring. Gravitational problems, when applied to uniform objects, simplify down to the gravitational forces acting upon the center of mass of each object. If the ring's center of mass aligns with the parent, then it will not experience a net gravitational pull from the parent. If, however, the the point is misaligned, then the ring will experience a gravitational force from the parent. Since the misaligned center of mass of the ring lies well outside of the ring, the entire ring will move as the center of mass orbits the parent's center of mass. This induces an external spin upon the station which introduces precession beyond what the stabilizers may have been designed for. 

Fundamentally, because L1 orbits with the moon, for every 24 hour period, points A,B,C,D will always return to the same position; but, the station will orbit 13 degrees to the marked L1 positions, each one above points A, B, C, and D respectively. Now suppose we have three shifts, each representing countries in the Cyan (CY), Magenta (MG), and Yellow (YW) nations below; and, suppose that the shifts are marked as CY from 00:00-08:00, MG from 08:00-16:00, and YW from 16:00-24:00. This means that after 9 days, the Earth will have rotated 9 times, and be at the same position; but, the station will have traveled 119.7 degrees around earth, or ~ 1/3 of its orbit. As a result, when CY begins their shift at 00:00 hundred hours, they'll find that directly below them is the start of MG territory. Normally this would indicate that they are ending their shift and MG's shift is about to begin; but, the station time is 00:00. If you choose L1, your station will need to use a 23.11 H day with shifts every 7.7 Hours (7 hours 42 minutes) to ensure shifts start and terminate above their respective territories.
