The only time I could see this being done would be if the first round was a recruiter screening, and then they ask you to refine your resume before passing it to the company (your applications should be different on a per-application basis anyway). Worth pointing out that I would avoid changing my given details mid-application, as that may indicate that you're trying to hide something, or are being less-than-truthful about some aspects. 

I'll admit that a 4-hour technical question is a little long, but is probably something to do with the seniority of the role. You appear to have missed the point of the exercise and are making excuses not to do it. Job hunting requires a sacrifice of personal time to do (the hunting, interviewing and testing), and companies expect you to be able to make those sacrifices. 

If you're talking an either-or situation, there are other factors to be considered. For me, I'd be looking at how often I'll need the added functionality of the laptop (the ability to take it to meetings/site visits, etc.) over the issues of fixed keyboard, trackpad, and screen. For me, being able to move my keyboard around my desk without throwing issues with the screen, and the ability to raise and lower the screen would do it for me. Plus the fact that a relatively small 17" monitor would be difficult to get on a laptop. 

Worth pointing out that many employers have rules about cell pones and personal calls, so reasonable recruiters/potential employers shouldn't require an immediate response to all calls. That being said, there will be some that will think less of you for letting your phone go to voicemail. Two points that I would make would be, as said above, ensure that your voicemail functions, and you either get notified of messages, or check regularly. Second, I would avoid putting your new number on any broadcasted application. If you make an application to a role, then that's fine, but if you're posting your CV on a job board/site, then I'd avoid it. I've found recruiters to be somewhat persistent and obstinate as a general rule (not all, but enough to get to me), and tend to call you repeatedly about opportunities which are not suitable, or not desired. 

Try to have less than 4 targets you want to 'hit' during the presentation, and if you must add shortcuts that let you skip anything in the middle. Really widdle it down to what's most important to show. This also cuts down the number of targets you need to clear before 'forcing' the presentation forward if people ask questions or want to go back. If people are slowing you down on target 2 and you have 8 more things to show you won't make it. But if you're on target 2 and you're already halfway through it becomes much more manageable. The Question Phase: At this point, let the demonstration step back and take a more natural tone. Re-visit the earliest part of the demonstration, and intentionally slow down and begin re-treading what you've just gone over but leave massive openings for questions. The goal now is to smoothly transition from "demonstration" to "live Q&A". If all goes well you've managed to fit an introduction and your main demonstration in under 7-8 minutes. Now you've probably wanted to go into waaay more detail on just about everything, and here's where the magic happens: People will have questions! BUT! NOT! ANNOYING! QUESTIONS! If you structured your points well, you'll find people are asking questions to all the points you wanted to hit anyway. This will both be interactive, and you'll have almost scripted your audience in advance. You'll also look incredibly well prepared as you're literally continuing your initial presentation, but in a responsive manner. Because you've covered the broad-brush stuff people won't ask nitpicky questions either; you'll find the questions people ask tend to be just one level of detail higher than what you've shown. If you go into super-detail people will ask super-detailed questions. If you keep it basic, people will ask the moderate questions in line with the points you wanted to hit. In the end if there's other things you wanted to hit that weren't asked, you can always drop any last-second pointers as the presentation wraps up, after the questions have died down. Personal Note: When I used this format I was working with a group known to interrupt and de-rail presentations. I also couldn't handle a huge number of questions because the product I was presenting (a website) was completely broken and unfinished. This is compounded by the fact that if they saw how horribly unfinished it was we risked them losing interest and not selling it. Imagine presenting an online shopping cart... But there was no cart, no product pages, and only one "working" category. That's where I was at. By keeping back most of the detail the staff wound up focusing on the points I wanted to cover, and I was shocked that nobody realised they had never actually seen any real content. In the end they were surprisingly glued to the presentation. 

I've seen numerous non-work related entries in resumes along the lines of: May 20xx - Jan 20xy Backpacking, Southeast Asia Travelled in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Worked for a NGO and visited Buddhist retreats. Aug 20xx - Jan 20xz Sabbatical Bought a boat and went sailing in the Caribbean. Also took time of when having my first child. Do not attempt to 'excuse' or 'justify' that you took time off; merely state the experiences gained as if they had been work related. Save going into detail about how and why the breaks were taken for the interview. Having non-work entries on a resume can make it stand out - which may be good or bad. However, since the periods are months to years, they probably at the very least need to be commented. 

EDIT: It seems you've only waited 21 of 30-45 days. So there is no outstanding payment. Not all clients acknowledge receiving an invoice. If you require such an acknowledgment, you should explicitly ask for it. 

Accept the nomination, as there is no way for you to know whether you would ever be nominated again. The upside to accepting is that you at the very least on your resum√© can claim to have been nominated for XXX in your first year out of school. The downside to declining could be risking to be percieved as an oddball, an over-thinker, ungrateful and so on. On a simplistic upside-downside scale, it seems the downside is potentially more harmful than the upside is beneficial. 

In a Danish context, this would probably not be a problem. After all, you are actively showing that the location interests you - and you already having a network there means the risk of the job not working out for social reasons (home sickness, loneliness) seems vastly lower. 

Wanting to return to your home country will virtually always be considered a valid reason for resignation. In fact, the reason is so generally accepted, you probably won't even need to cite other workplace-related reasons. Having said that, emigrating to another country is often difficult - especially if there is a language barrier. These things take time - but if you already now feel that your expectations and reality are too far apart to ever really meet, perhaps it is time to cut your losses. 

Maybe. It depends on who dropped the ball; if it was the recruiter, the government, or the employer. If it was the recruiter then demand compensation from them and depending on the laws of the area you may be able to seek legal compensation if they turn down your request. If it's the government there may be paperwork to fill out otherwise you're up the same avenue as with the recruiter, but historically speaking you'll be in for a harder time since governments tend to be very slow moving and might just say "we never guarantee a response time". You might spend more time than is worth fighting for compensation, and there's a chance you won't be. If it's the employer, that's up to your personal judgement whether you seek to demand compensation before starting. You can certainly politely request it, and a 'good' employer might give you a token holdover for the mix-up. But if you choose to press it you may risk damaging your relationship with them early - so it's a personal decision up to your discretion. 

Lastly, and this one is personal: - Have you been to a doctor lately? If you have severe sleep issues despite a HEALTHY lifestyle, you may have an issue like low blood pressure or nutrient deficiencies. 

While counter-intuitive holding back information keeps it digestible, and when you do get questions later you'll find they'll closely follow the bullet points. Just because you put a bullet-point on a presentation saying you'll cover X doesn't mean it has to be scripted. This actually manipulates the questions into the presentation; if you know questions are coming - make it the questions you want. Then you'll be prepared and in control during the demonstration. The Demonstration People expect demonstrations to take longer, and whether you want them or not questions WILL eventually come: so what you want to do is cover the main points in the demonstration very quickly so by the time people begin butting in with their inquiries you've already hit the marks you've aimed for. Keep this step under 3 minutes, and treat it like the introduction. This isn't the time for detail yet. This is just showing your introduction again, but live. If you can, have the areas of your demonstration ready in advance. Don't explain, just show, and keep any description down to sound-bytes. If you can, write a 'micro-narrative' which people will mentally follow, such as the path a user might take though a system: "This is the online store, simple, clean. The shopping cart, and here's the checkout page." Don't rush this part though; even though you're moving quickly, you still need to keep it digestible. The main risk here is having someone in the room ask "can you go back?", which will kill all momentum and kick you into the main questions phase prematurely. If you have particularly impatient audience members who ask questions, take the question but try to use it as a lead-in for the next part of the demo. If I were showing a shopping cart and my next stop was the checkout here's how I'd manage the following; 

Perhaps a explanation along these lines could work: All code rests on assumptions - which may turn out to be wrong or even start out as correct, but later become false. Quite often, it is assumed that user input validation is centralized, so underlying services assume their input data is valid. If someone else bypasses this central validation, bugs will be expected. Very few bugs are created on purpose, but rather because another developer changed code without being aware of the assumptions related to that code. Sadly, most code is undocumented, meaning developers need to make educated guesses regarding use. Others times, documentation exists, but only as way too long templated Word documents that typically bury the relevant stuff in tons of boilerplate. In addition, the more documentation, the less likely that is has actually been updated when the code changes. 

It seems your 3-day projects turning into 3-week ordeals could be viewed as a form of 'agile development' with numerous short feedback loops. Perhaps it seems chaotic, but if it delivers value it is merely a well-functioning light-weight process. Have a talk with your manager about the working process, stating that you are unsure of whether he and the organization are satisfied. There is a good chance that he views you as flexible and delivering value; two things that usually resonate in an organization. 

I have a degree in geology, but have never worked as a geologist. Being a programming freelancer, I still list it - even though it seems less relevant than computer science or engineering would. Apart from demonstrating that you have higher education, it can sometimes actually make your CV stand out from all the other more 'predictable' ones. 

Telling him you feel he is overworked seems like a really bad idea, as you essentially will be telling your boss that he isn't doing his job. That could seriously backfire. A less risky approach could be to offer to help him. Next time he seems overworked, offer to take a task you could do, off his hands. If you complete it successfully, continue to offer your help until he eventually starts delegating tasks to you. It is probably a lot better that you demonstrate that you can ease his workload than have a conversation that will at the very least be awkward and potentially disastrous for you.
