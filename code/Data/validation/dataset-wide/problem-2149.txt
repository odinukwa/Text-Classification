Keep track of the interuptions you create. How many were uneccessary? You may have opened the door to this behavior. Is this being done by one or two people? You may have a point. Establish times when you do not want to be disturbed. Many companies have an open door policy, so this may not be so easy. It's unrealistic to think everyone should always assume you're busy. You'd be surprised if you ask politely for someone to come back at a later time. I don't think you should assume everyone else will memorize every piece of trivia in your company. I'm amazed at how much easier it is to find information on the internet than within my own company. 

I think the best gift you can give is to refer him/her to other job applicants. This not only shows you appreciate what they did for you, but that you acknowledge their abilities and are willing to go out of your way and put your reputation on the line by vouching for them. 

401k rules are not entirely to the discretion of the company. Most of the fairness rules are there to make sure those on the top part of the salaries don't get preferential treatment. $URL$ You being an exception to the vesting period could draw some attention from the IRS and your company wouldn't want the hassle. Go ahead and ask. If they can't do it, they may just feel a higher starting salary is easier. 

Working remotely is not as common as people may think even for programmers. Just look at the job sites and compare. It is a complicated trust issue that may take a lot of time. I've worked remotely (far enough away to require air travel) at 3 different jobs, but this didn't happen until I worked there for 2-3 years. Edit: I recommend the section on how to approach a boss to work remotely in the book, The Four Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss.. It is a pretty good strategy that I've paraphrased a bit here. (Side Note: I think he's back-pedaled off his claim by excluding things you like to do from his definition of work. As a programmer, I guess if I only spend 4 hours a week answering user email, I've made it.) 

It's probably an individual preference. And if your group prefers the isolation all the time, it may hinder the group productivity. Talk to your coworkers about the communication impedance. This is a good thing if interuptions are a problem, but it's bad if everyone is reluctant toa speak to the group when needed. If you need to have a meeting, have everyone turn around in their chairs away from their computers. Make it quick. Four people talking to each other while working on their computers is good for chit-chat, but not important discussions. Multi-tasking is just a euphemism for not paying attention. 

Whatever level of reinforcement they're getting, remove it. They show up, but they don't work. Make them leave. This takes away any enjoyment they get from hanging around and believing they're fooling someone into believing they're actually a contributor. Take this away. There will be some who don't care and would rather be somewhere else, but at least these people who hang-around doing nothing are not a constant reminder to those who are working. Feel free to discuss this with those who are working. They may not want to take any responsibility for this, so they may not want to vote in favor. I would present it as, I told the people who aren't working to leave, do you mind? They'll probably be non-committal. Good, don't mention it any more and let everyone get back to work. 

You're going to have to tell some lies or at least half-truths to these questions. Indicating you're this close to graduation, but decided to quit isn't going to get you very far IMHO. Things always come up. You can tell them you have another offer or the dog ate your homework. Consider an internship and don't waste grown-up's time. 

You may find you have to tailor these to the requirements of different jobs. If they want 5 years of experience in technology "X" you should highlight that fact. The intitial review of your CV may be by a person who is not familiar enough with technology to differentiate between someone who knows what they're doing and someone with 3 years of experience. A cover letter may the place you stress how well you know the technology (details included in CV) eventhough you only have 4 years instead of 5 years of experience. You don't want to draw attention to this fact by literally indicating the number of years, but someone could do the math by looking at your job experience. 

Although it is great that she wants to be productive, but it is not acceptable to do it at the expense of the others at the meeting. The goal there is for everyone to benefit. I don't think email is as effective. You should have confronted her in person if you feel this strong about it. It can be difficult for people to understand your full intent of a request. Sometimes email comes across as blunt and impersonal, but in this case it may be seen as not a big deal. It is easy to give a quick reply with excuses. Next time it happens. I suggest you request a one on one meeting right after the next meeting this occurs. If the problem is solved, you should thank her in person. It is important to keep up appearances. She actually may be getting many things done, but the impression by others in the office may not agree. 

Get over it. You've made your objections and suggestions, so now it's time to get things done. That means you have to accept the leader or go find another job. You could ask to work on a prototype to make your point, but eventually, it's time to stop with the planning discussions and get the thing built. I know as an engineer you feel there is an absolute right way, but as many have point ed out, it's not always black and white. Your company has no mechanism for someone leaping over their leader when there are technical disagreements on projects. You can try and start something, but I doubt that will help this specific project. If you implement the leader's ideas to the best of your ability and they fail, maybe they'll make you the leader and some jr. dev will want to implement some framework barely out of beta and accuse you of a bad design. 

I think there are two factors here that indicate you should make this situation an exception besides the fact you think it would be a good job. 

If you're sincere about wanting to stay, just ask for a raise. Put in your notice if you don't get it. You shouldn't do it right away. Take your time and write a good resignation. Let them know that you like the company, but found an opportunity that fits your career goals. Don't put in writing that you left for more money. They'll assume you're getting more money. Just tell the truth if asked during the exit interview. Don't burn any bridges. 

I suspect there is a communication breakdown here or someone in authority isn't taking charge. Teams are easier to manage within themselves, but it can get difficult when they have to be shared. There may need to be a shift to a more stringent/formalized process when it comes to "borrowing" people's time who don't directly report to you. Here are points you need to address: 

When the CEO gives you a directive that contradicts what your supervisor wants, document it and give it to your supervisor. Use the same system for tracking requirements, changes, etc. Make changes to delivery dates if necessary. Everyone needs to know how these changes affect the project. Having this documentation is very important. The CEO probably doesn't remember half of the stuff he's telling everyone to do in the "drive by" meetings. If you think there are going to be negative consequences using the CEO's input, privately send those concerns to your supervisor. You're just providing information. He can decide to over-ride it, discuss with the CEO, etc. At some point, someone should notice all of these changes and decide if they are hindering the project or not. Your supervisor will have to decide if the CEO's technical advice is bad enough to confront him over. It just looks like your manager isn't going to question the CEO, so under this context, I don't see how any advice is going to fix this situation unless you can motivate your boss and toughen him up enough to take on his boss. 

You have to decide if you have enough of a relationship with your boss where you can discuss this with him. Not all people will pick-up non how irritating this is to you. I would tell him that his negative reactions have made me not want to make any suggestions. Get some feedback on what you tend to do wrong in his mind. Are you using too much jargon? Are you always pointing out very rare edge-cases that annoy him? Should you approach him at different times of the day? Would he prefer email responses? You may find that he is irritated with something or someone that doesn't have anything to do with you.The point is, if you want any hope of fixing this situation, you're going to have to talk to him about it. Emphasis your goal is to be productive and effective in a way that works for your boss. If he thinks his yelling is not that bad or for some reason you should just take it, moving on or just saying as little as possible may be your only options. 

Not all graduate students get to do research on anything they want. You have to be able to put a committee together of people that know something about what you're doing. You picked a technology you were comfortable with at the time. It happens. A thesis is much more of a learning experience for the student than creating ground breaking research. You think it is one of the best companies for many reasons. That's pretty compelling. If I'm trying to lure someone away from another company, I have no problem with higher salary playing a role. Just don't give the impression that is the only reason. Personally, I'm getting sick and tired of people being treated as a pariah for wanting to make more money. If I'm leaving a job that pays 40K for one that pays 100K, you bet your ass money has something to do with it. 

Many people will follow the boss's lead. He works they work; he plays they play. He's gone; they do whatever they want. If you're on a team with people who believe this can go on forever and there's nothing they can do or are willing to do, you're stuck. Identify the things that will make money, start doing them and encourage others to do the same. Maybe you can hold some meetings or discussions about these things during the coffee breaks instead of taking other time away. If you really think you're on the brink of leaving, have this conversation with your boss. Maybe he feels that since he can't afford to pay good people more money, the least he can do is get them to blow off an hour or so. 

The graceful way is to offer your manager a potential solution to help him with the amount of work in his plate and getting projects finished sooner. Don't start with trying to limit your hours in general, but doing things at the last minute is taking a risk of more errors. He may be worried that things will happen without his knowledge. Work on documentation of the requests and that if you feel someone is making an unnecessary requirement, you'll bring it to his attention. He is responsible for the project and sometimes that leads to micro-managing. There could be other checks and balances required by the company to keep him in the loop. I've had managers who tried to insulate their team from ad hoc requests especially and I only would work directly with users when given permission on particular projects. There may be other solutions to free up his time (Isn't that the real problem?). Does he take on the sole responsibility of finding replacements? You'll never provide the best solution until you have all the information. Just because this is a bottleneck for your projects may not be perceived as a problem for the company (ie. they don't care if you have to work late.).
