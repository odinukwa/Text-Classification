Most gun ranges will accept live ammunition for disposal in my area. I would check there, and if not there, a police department would be my next stop. This answer probably only works in the United States, I am not sure about abroad, and as a commentor pointed out, outside the United States, and especially in Europe, you may be finding military unexploded ordinance left over from the war. Don't try to pick up ordinance like unexploded artillery shells. Additionally, shotgun shells and other ammunition often contain lead. If you are handling shotgun shells, expended or unexpended, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before you eat, or wear gloves. Seperate the shells from other items in your pack so you don't contaminate anything. I never allow my children to handle expended shells because lead is particularly hard on children. In reality, picking up a few shells here and there probably isn't going to materially change your lead load, but best practices are certainly to be cautious and if you routinely encounter spent shells, make sure you have good lead abatement habits. Shotgun shell specific: I have dealt with plastic hulled shotgun shells by using my pocket knife to score the outer shell so that I can remove the end. Then I dump out the pellets (remember they are likely lead), remove the wad, and then you are left with the two most dangerous parts of the shell, the powder and the primer. You can dispose of the powder in any number of ways. My favorite is to make a pile and light it on fire. Without containment, the powder just burns, it doesn't explode. You can also just scatter it and it won't be likely to pose a threat to anyone, however you haven't removed it from the environment at that point. As for the primer, don't try to do anything with it. It will explode if hit with a concussive force. A primer can kill a person if it is up close even without any sort of containment. Just take the leftover primer and shell to your local shooting range for disposal. Now you are hiking back much less AND if a shell happens to detonate in your pack (extremely unlikely), it is only the primer with no powder to ignite, so the damage will likely be nothing or close to nothing. 

If your friend is undoubtedly dead, then your own safety becomes paramount. If you can't safely get to the body, then you can only leave it in situ until you get the authorities there (by whatever means). In the unlikely event the body is in the open and readily to hand, then practically speaking, protecting the dignity of your friend (and family) is most important. If you have no means of contacting the authorities from where you are and have to travel some distance to gain help/communication: 

Because roads are harder than hooves, and whatever is harder usually wears down whatever is softer. It's also pretty good protection against chipping/splitting that the horse may get from stepping on rocks. 

A couple of factors from my own experience are: Pronation - I over-pronate slightly, so the outside of my heel gets worn down more quickly than the inside. When it wears past a certain point, I find myself rolling my ankle more than usual and end up buying new boots. Sole material - The softness of the sole material has a large impact on the longevity. Soft "comfort" soles of course wear out a lot faster than harder soles. This of course is why running shoes wear out quickly. Of course, the downside is that harder soles can be a little less comfortable, but that's something you'll need to weigh up for yourself. I'd agree that 300 miles (30 decent walks) are on the low end of what you'd expect. I'd advise you to take a good look over your worn-out boots and identify where they've worn out the most, then buy something that addresses those points. Or take an old pair into a reputable store and ask for guidance. 

I use a very nice pair of 15x50 image stabilised binoculars for birding/wildlife. Yes, they're pretty heavy but when I can stand next to a birder with a dedicated spotting scope and see things that he can't, I'm pretty happy with myself. It's also pretty good for aviation and for casual star-gazing. The image stabilisation doesn't seem to affect image quality in any significant way. Heavy and expensive though. 

At the risk of suggesting the obvious here: 1) Rig up an internal hoop. Use a spare of one of the external hoops and cut a few inches off to fit. Pad the ends, and Velcro the ends and top to the inside of the tent. 2) Put a few more guy-ropes on the end hoops to encourage some more lateral tension. Second option should be the easiest one to try. 

I like using small boats for duck hunting. I was recently given a sit-in two-seater kayak that I have painted and I am ready to take out on the marshes. Although I have used small canoes and the like before, this will be my first time in a kayak. I specifically want to use this boat where the paddle is more difficult because of length, wind, or current, and I want to use the double-ended paddle, lower profile, and lower weight of my kayak to get to further places. I am trying to figure out how to transport my shotgun. My shotgun doesn't need to be at the ready because I will be kayaking to a location, setting up and hunting, then kayaking back. I could bungee it in place on the deck or throw it on the floor of the kayak in the floating gun case I use, but I am concerned as it is a high-dollar item and I want to do all I can to make sure I don't loose it. Getting it wet is inevitable so some water will be fine. What are the options for transporting the gun in the way most likely to be retained in case of an accident? My kayak is a two seater with no spray skirt. My dog will be riding in the front seat and has been trained to do well on all manner of boats, so she will be fine but taking up the front seat. This will be in fresh and salt water. The temperatures will be about 35 degrees F to about 60 degrees F. Any tips or tricks for transporting high-value cargo in a kayak like my shotgun? 

The butcher's comments sound completely bunk to me. Although there may be some difference in overall taste by not keeping your meat vertical with good air circulation, this variable is often out of our control during hunting, and for a short amount of time right after the kill with a dressed animal, the difference will be small, in my opinion. Your butcher is probably doing what most deer processors do and is going to take your deer, and 12 others, and process them in bulk. You get back your meat pound-for-pound, but it could be from any of the other 12 animals. This means your meticulous care of your animal goes completely to waste when you get some idiot's deer that was poorly dressed and poorly cared for. Butchers control for this aggregation a little by trying to reject lower quality animals, and I think that is why they don't want to butcher yours. There may be other factors at play if this a local butcher, such as he is full up and doesn't want to admit it, only wants to process larger animals because his profit is higher, etc. Your doe could have had the supplest of summer succor to savor, and have meat that is so sweet and tender that it makes the best Waygu beef taste like sawdust in comparison, and the slight delay in hanging may have not produced the apex taste of that meat, but it could still be one of the best deer ever. Or, she could have been subsisting on twigs and bark, and no amount of care will elevate her beyond the grind-and-heavily-spice stage. I wouldn't think twice about how you handled your deer if it were mine, and I would process her expecting the taste to be much more controlled by her summer diet than your handling. Do yourself a favor and just process the deer yourself if at all possible. The results are so much better than the processor, in my opinion, that the ability to process the animal myself is what has kept me big game hunting after some of the other attraction has faded. Everything you need to know about butchering a deer can be learned from Youtube and reading, but for deer, I would start by identifying the prime cuts (tenders, and backstrap) and cut those out and save for steaks. Then start cutting high up on the rump. Cut off a bit, fry it up and try it (maybe a dash of salt to bring out the taste). If you like it, cut steaks out of that muscle group. Keep going and soon you will run out of steak. Grind the rest. Cut off bits from different parts and do this sampling technique and quickly you will know what you want for steaks, stew, or grind. Once you do this, you can tell by sight, feel, and smell, even after the meat is off the carcass. Enjoy the best part of deer hunting, in my opinion, the butchering!
