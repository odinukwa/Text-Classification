I think I missed a lot of opportunities to go faster when cruising and not taking advantage of tailwind. I find that if I put short effort in acceleration, the tailwind will take care most of the speed maintaining work. For big tailwind I can usually see leaves rolling on along my general direction. Lately, I think if wind noise is more quite, I might be in tailwind? So how can you tell if you've got tailwind or wind direction in general? (without flag anywhere nearby) 

big. difference. Let say the GF (48 kg) can output 256 watt of power. That means on bike A (16 kg) her power to weight ratio would be 4 w/kg while on bike B (8 kg) it'd be 4.57 w/kg. Compare that to random guy (64 kg) who can produce 320 w. On bike A he'd have 4 w/kg and on bike B it's 4.44 w/kg. The gain is bigger for the GF than the random guy (0.57 w/kg vs 0.44 w/kg). 

I thought I read somewhere something like having someone drafting behind also has effect to the rider in front. I wonder if it's true and would like to understand how does it work because it's quite unintuitive (if it's true at all). So, other than robbing the rider in front from tailwind, does the drafter help at all? 

Carbon fibre frames and forks don't have the same amount of travel (shock absorbing capability) as shocks. I had to dig up to get some evidence and from an old Trek Madone brochure I found some vertical compliance numbers, which were based on 2007 models: 

My understanding is yellow is better for moving objects and orange is better when you're lost and needed to be found/rescued. Consider the following quotes from Wikipedia (not exact colors, but close): School bus yellow "The color was chosen because it attracts attention and is noticed quickly in peripheral vision, faster than any other color. Scientists describe this as follows: "Lateral peripheral vision for detecting yellows is 1.24 times greater than for red." and Safety orange "Safety orange is used to set objects apart from their surroundings, particularly in complementary contrast to the azure color of the sky (azure is the complementary color of orange, and therefore there is a very strong contrast between the two colors)." however Hi-vis clothing "A 2009 Australian study of drivers trying to see stationary cyclists on a closed circuit found that fluorescent vests (without retro-reflective stripes) were not a significant improvement on black clothing at night, and that retro-reflective strips were more effective when attached to knees and ankles than on a more or less static jacket." So maybe we should just drop the vest and put reflective strips on legs. 

It's a common problem with GPS that has no wifi or cellular network assistance. In any case you should wait for the GPS to have a lock before you ride. What I usually do is get out on the road, stop, wait for lock then continue riding. You obviously don't want to stop and wait forever. Good thing is while it's trying lock your position, you can see on the display how many satellites it can see and how strong their signals are. So, if just outside your office you see that only there are only three satellites the GPS can see, better to go to a near open space (e.g. the federation square) and try to get a lock there. Other option is to use a mobile that has a GPS. Mobiles can use wifi and cellular network (which are plenty in CBDs) to lock position quickly. Possible down side is less accuracy on cheap mobiles, but I don't think that's a big issue for commuting where the roads around cities are straight. Mobiles should also be more accurate with tall buildings around where satellites signal are patchy and completely blanketed by wifi and cellular networks. 

I was coming out of a corner and saw something on the road about 10 meters up but only from about 5 meters I realised it's a snake trying to cross the path. I panicked but didn't really do anything. Fortunately, it crossed the past quick enough, I just ended up so annoyed/scared. What's the best action in that situation? Accelerate as hard as you can, while trying to avoid it? Or aim for it? I was too afraid that if I stopped it might chase me. 

I remember one of the old Discovery Channel team mechanics, said the difference between Trek sizes isn't that big (2 cm) so their riders could use 1 size smaller or bigger. Other than fit, there's also personal preference, like going smaller to get a lighter frame, and pros do this. So, don't sweat about it too much. If you have a pretty good guess about your perfect size, than 1 size smaller or bigger wouldn't matter much. Even if you did a test ride, I doubt that it will help much if you didn't have a good idea of what to expect. Even if you could get a perfect size (53 cm), because it's only based on seat tube length, it might not give you the perfect fit still because the top tube length could be shorter/longer for you. You can adjust differences in seat tube length by adjusting seat post and switch stems to accommodate top tube length. I used to ride 52 and now riding 50 madone because the 52 was sold out and that 50 was heavily discounted. The shop shown me that even with smaller frame the measurements are still the same as the old bike. That said, if you're thinking about ironman, I think you should go with the 54 because the the wheelbase is longer and will give more stability. Usually TT bikes have longer wheelbase. 

In time trial races, I see people are using these big chainrings. Is 50/11 combination doesn't give enough top speed? What's the real advantage? I can only think of the negative, which is it makes the speed difference between two cogs wider. EDIT: new info I found this article One ring to rule them all: Tony Martin's Canyon Speedmax, stating another benefit of using large chainring: 

One time I hear someone said, with satisfaction, that his aero wheels sound awesome. I wonder where does the noise come from, is it because you ride so fast the pushed air makes the noise or is it just noise of carbon fairing vibration? 

The only 'theory' I can find is Steve Hed's, which is based on aerodynamic of wheels. See this article $URL$ for example. While this sounds like it only make sense for road wheels, I can't find any theory against it on other type of wheels. Looks like the best combination would be of the tyre to be as wide as the rim, so the tyre will 'look' straight to the air, e.g. 23 mm tyre on 23 mm rim. There are also tyres with 'lip' that should cover the gap between tyre and rim to make it even smoother. If you put 28 mm tyre on 23 mm rim, the tyre will create a bulge that will be visible to the air. This also makes tyre selection rather limited because rim sizes don't vary much, e.g. 23 mm rims only available a few years ago. Currently, I'm still using 19 mm tyres on my 18 mm wide rims. I'd love to get 23 mm wheels so I can use 23 mm tyres first because it's better, second because it's hard to find 19 mm tyres. On Sheldon's page he also mentioned that many cyclist exceeded the recommended widths on his page without any problem. About the rim being disc brake rim, I don't think it makes any difference because even if the rim was shallower, the wheel diameter stays the same. 

Furthermore, on Trek website, they say their Trek Domane has at least twice the compliance of other bikes, on the generous side that would be 1.3 inch using their own data. That's only 33 mm of travel. That said, maybe watching Paris-Roubaix video can convince you either way, either you think they're crazy or that road bikes are not too bad in that kind of awful condition. Btw, carbon bikes are not only lighter, they also look good ;) 

This might not be welcomed but Michele Ferrari has a website $URL$ The idea is to use smaller gear and higher cadence because using 11 cog requires tremendous amount of torque that makes it hard to pedal efficiently. With 11 speed cassette now available, tighter spacing between cogs is achievable with 11 cog. But use 12 if you want to be efficient. 

iBike is a power meter that uses the same thinking as yours. Instead of measuring forces produces by your legs, it calculates power based on speed, gradient and wind resistance. So what you get is power measurements that has wind resistance factored in as you want, plus gravity and other resistance. see $URL$ Compared to other power meters, it looks like a pretty good cheaper alternative, it's still not cheap. 

You get aero benefit when you ride at the front and at the back. So it depends on how big is the group. Or more to the point, how long you spend time at the front and at the back. If you ride in two lines in group of four the you get the aero benefit 100% of the time (in different amount). If there are 6 in a group riding in two lines then 67% of the time you get aero benefit, assuming equal time spent in every position. If the group forms 4 rows then you get benefit 50% of the time, and so on. It diminishes as the group gets larger. If you're a protected rider or just a passenger, then you don't get any benefit at all. But you could also spend 99% of them in the middle of the pack conserving and wishing you have all aero advantage when it comes to the sprint. I think when riding in bunch (forming more than 2 lines) the aerodynamic is a bit different for the guys in the middle because it's not only there's less air resistance but it also sort of move in the same direction as the group. Kind of like there's no advantage of being aero when having some tailwind. Positioning might be the key there. 

You know the dust that's left on the rims' groove after a while, does it have any significance in braking or rim life? When washing the wheels I just realised that the dust must be coming from brake pads but couldn't figure out whether or not I should wash the wheels more often to keep it clean. Will I make the pads and rims wear out faster if I clean more often? 

Some levels of group set give higher level of customisation too, like shorter or longer crank length for example or shifter adjustability. Electric group sets also give some functionality too, i.e. not having to adjust/tune derailleurs and guaranteed perfect shift every time. Other than functionality there's weight and bling, which could be socially important. I prefer a balance approach, if you're buying a top level bike, then get Dura Ace to match. If it's a second level bike, then get Ultegra, and so on. Otherwise you will risk someone (like me ;) asking why you put tiagra on a nice bike, you're not doing justice and so on. 

I'd say it can be normal because there are many factors can stress a wheel and depends on the quality of the wheels, they might need to be trued again. There's an article about how they build wheels at Bontrager: Inside Bontrager Wheel Factory. tldr; Expensive wheels are trued, stressed, trued, and stressed again, trued again. Your wheels were trued in the factory (maybe only once), then you stressed them and now somebody needs to true them again. 

If you can, find the approximate gradient of hills you want to climb/train on and estimate your power to weight ratio. For 7% climb 34/25 (front/back) is good combination if you have power weight ratio >= 4. With less power, or more weight/load, just get the biggest cassette allowed by the rear derailleur. This way you can maintain about 60 rpm or higher on long 7% climb and that's good for training. Just upshift when you want to train at lower rpm. $URL$ can help giving some ideas how a climb like. 

11-26. You can't get higher gear combination than 53/11 with a 50, 11 is the smallest cog available. And 53/28 is about equal to 50/26. Hopefully it will be more comfortable because the tighter gear ratios. 

You have to check if the chainrings have the same Bolt Circle Diameter (BCD). I think compact cranks have 110 mm BCD and normal one usually 130 mm BCD. See also $URL$ to see BCD in detail. 

In case of road bikes, back in 2012 (when question was asked), there was simply no option. There was some cyclocross setup but didn't really sell in this market. Road single chainring group set only available in 2015 by SRAM. I just switched to their 1x11 (48t 11-36) from 2x10 (50/36 11-26). Hardly miss the closer ratio of the 2x10 or top speed, which probably would be important if you race. I really appreciate the easier effort needed to clean bottom bracket area. I can see that 1x12 setup is coming, so expect to see more people switch from double chainrings. And then we'll probably can have single chainring specific frames, i.e. without the extra cable stops, hole and routing for front derailleur. 

I have a satori, but should be similar with other trainer. The satori has 10 resistance settings. In addition to that, you still have your bike gears to adjust the load, so you can spin fast with very light load. So you shouldn't worry that it will be too hard to spin. To give some illustration, the lightest setting should be rideable for anyone who can ride a bike. #3 setting with max gear on the bike should be pretty hard for someone with 200 w. 

Check the specification. Some wheels have weight limitations, but your model doesn't look like to have one. One example is one of the Hed wheels (Jets) which in standard build (18/24 spokes) limited to 190 lbs but can be upgraded (with more spokes, 20/28) for 225 lbs riders. 

Mostly cosmetic and weight. You can check shimano website ($URL$ and look for "exploded parts" documents the parts your interested in. You will find that different level of components (105 vs ultegra) share a lot of smaller components and where it differs sometimes it's cosmetic (e.g. cap on top of the shifter) or weight (e.g. carbon material). Some parts do have performance differences, hubs for example, can have more balls in the bearings then lower level hubs. It's a good idea to check those tech documents to see what you're paying for. 

You are correct that weight is force (mass x gravity acceleration). If you're continuously falling and using imaginary pedal convert the force into forward motion then you can accelerate like gravity. But you're not continuously falling, for every downward movement of your body you also push upward, which means you don't get any gain there and the force driving your bike comes from your legs (and wind). Unless you can gain power by gaining mass (possible), it'll just weigh you down.
