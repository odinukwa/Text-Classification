1 word: Disease. Disease is your friend in this instance. In the real world, the prevalence of disease in the temperate climates is, well, tempered by the arrival of winter every year, which kills lots of carrying vectors of disease. The tropical parts of the world have no such protection, and, since humans have been living in tropical areas such as Africa for hundreds of thousands of years, local diseases are particularly well adapted to infect humans. For sailors and would be colonizers from Europe, unaccustomed to the local disease load, this was almost certain death. Crew losses due to disease during the 16th century ranged up to about half of the crew. (!) Every fresh boatload of would-be colonizers would be struck just as hard. Europe did not make any serious inroads into Tropical Africa until after Pasteur's germ theory of disease laid the basis for thinking scientifically about combating disease. Even the survivors would be left weakened and at risk for the next bout of disease. 

Svalbard Archipelago, Nordaustlandet island. 14,443 square kilometres, uninhabited, mostly barren and covered in the Austfonna glacier, demilitarized by treaty, so no pesky soldiers to get in your face. It's so remote that the German outpost there during WWII took months to find out the rest of the Nazi forces had surrendered. 

I believe the instant you put something into one side of the portal, out comes out the other, as if you stepped through a doorway. Do you mean what happens if you turn off the portal while the object is halfway through when the portal closes? If you want to destroy something -- as in the game -- it's easier to open up one side of the portal high above the target and one side on the floor beneath the target and let the target fall repeatedly through until it reached terminal velocity, then close the portal, so the object crashes at high speed into the floor. Or open a portal high above the target and then open the other side under a very heavy object so that it crashes onto the target. 

Quick Answer: Here's a really good paper on the subject. One graph in the paper indicates about 30 milliseconds for most of the audio -- muzzle blast through echoes -- to be received 9 meters from a rifle. Onto that, you'd add processing time, which I would guess would also be measured in the low milliseconds. The processing time should be fairly constant, and you could run multiple detectors -- optimized for different distances and directions of fire. The dominant times would be: a) how much of the 30 or so milliseconds your detector needs to see to make the call, and b) the distance of the gun from the cyborg -- depending on the direction of the fire. My musings: So it depends on the relationship of the cyborg to the bullet's path as to what it will hear. If the bullet is fired at or near the cyborg, and if the bullet it supersonic, the cyborg might first hear an impact -- though that would be hard to distinguish from other sounds -- followed by the shockwave from the bullet, followed by the "bang" of the gun, then echoes and reflections of the shockwave and the "bang". If the bullet is subsonic, there will be no sonic crack, but if the bullet goes beyond the cyborg there may still be a fairly unique "zing" of a fast object flying by. If the bullet is fired away from the cyborg, it will hear the "bang" first, then some of the sonic boom. And then a fair amount of reflections and echoes. Loudness-wise, an unsurpressed rifle can be 160 dB very close by. (This is why suppressors or hearing protection are a big deal: percussive sounds like this will damage your hearing if greater than 140 dB. Remember that the dB scale is logarithmic.) Sound intensity falls off with the square of the distance, though if you're close there are probably not a lot of sounds in your city that are as loud as an unsuppressed gun, if only because of lawsuits for hearing damage. Msalters' answer is fascinating. I imagine their product uses multiple sensors, spread out over city blocks, to triangulate the position of the shot. (Not an easy task due to reflections/echoes, etc.) So, all that said, if you only intend for your cyborg to determine that a shot has been fired somewhere nearby, the time to detection would vary depending on whether the shot was fired towards or away from the cyborg (with supersonic bullets, at least). At an absolute minimum, if a supersonic bullet was fired at the cyborg, the shockwave would reach the cyborg in as little as 1/3 the time it would take the "bang" to propagate to the cyborg. At a maximum, the shot would be fired away from the cyborg and we'd have to wait for the "bang" at the speed of sound. If you want to locate the shot, you would have to wait until multiple cyborgs hear the shot, and coordinate between themselves. (Or perhaps one cyborg that has a pretty long distance between its "ears", but echoes/reflections will still make it difficult.) Actual recognition time is dominated by how much sound you need to hear to capture enough of a picture of the sound wave to try to identify it, followed by processing time. Considering you have cyborgs, I assume there is a lot of computing power, so that would add something on the order of a few milliseconds. 

Plasma weapons are a popular SF concept that just won't go away. They are encountered in such diverse places as the original Star Trek TV series, and the Babylon 5 TV series. They play the role of a futuristic flame-thrower. Their main draw-back is that they won't work. Plasma is the so-called "fourth state of matter", and is basically hot air. When we say something is hot, we're actually talking about the speed with which its individual component atoms wiggle around. Room temperature gas moves at about 500 m/s. Obviously, plasma is really really hot. That is, it is a gas heated to temperatures comparable to the interior of a star or the center of a thermonuclear explosion so that all the atoms are ionized. Unfortunately, according to the virial theorem, the plasma wants to equalize its internal pressure with the external, i.e., it wants to expand into a diffuse cloud of nothing. And since it moves really really fast, this means that after the plasmoid travels for one second, its diameter will be approximately five thousand kilometers, i.e., it has dissipated into nothing. More cool info here So I'd go with lasers. :) For extra oomph, make them gamma ray lasers. 

While so called mind transfer into a new body is all very interesting, and will obviously be Brin's plan B, he's strangely unwilling to have his primary body die in horrible agony, only for some body double with his memories to inherit all this wealth and power. He's more interested in direct technological ways to gain (near)immunity to being killed in the ways listed above. 

Elves might be an insular culture, seeing crossbreeding with round-eared species as a bad thing. This might be reinforced by an increase in deformities and so forth from such crossbreeding, such that they are called "monsters". In such a society, where the pointiness of one's ears is a sign of genetic purity and likelihood of avoiding genetic problems in one's children, you would expect a selection force towards pointiness. The existence of some round-ears in each generation - whether just as a random mutation, a dalliance with a human, or rape by a human hunting party - is unavoidable. But if these are treated as second-class citizens, then what elven lady would want to mate with them and doom her children to such a life? 

One way is to place everything in plain sight. The cash cage is in the center of the room, visible to everyone, but close bars/mesh prevent access apart from through slots and one locked gate. Try to rob it, you have to get past everyone in the building. Downside in this security is if you breach it, there may be a stampede of patrons to take advantage... But if you can arrange it so that anyone accessing/raiding the vault would be visible to those in the room, and would have to leave through them, then you've done well. Security is best when multi-layered. Access corridors should allow viewing of those who approach. There should be dummy vaults and other misdirection, big security for a vault that contains only casino chips. Lots of ways to view people approaching the vault, lots of ways to prevent them arriving, lots of identity checks, lots of ways to prevent magical approaches, magic nullifying fields, etc. In a world with magic, the actual vault could be an airless vault carved of bedrock 50 ft below the ground, filled with superheated oil, with no tunnel or passage leading to it, and only the money, a number of golems, and small one-way airlocked portals for moving money in or out, only openable briefly, at specified pseudorandom times, by a trusted mage, when a golem briefly disables a specific ward that would otherwise prevent teleporting, and the money capsules only be safely openable after cooling, etc etc. End of each night, the profits go in. End of each month, wages are drawn out. Each coin of the money itself could be cursed to cry out when taken until returned to the oil. Or to silently report its location to the mages. Or the conveniently carriable bags that it's in could do this, thus using fewer spells. Wards (and backup "tripwires connected to bells") could detect digging, and other voids could be filled with acid to discourage random digging. 

It will be tough I am not a doctor or an expert on the topic, but I cannot find any sources for permanent acclimatizing by humans above 5500 meters. La Rinconada, in Peru, is the highest known permanent settlement, and it's only at 5100 meters. Military studies show no adaptation and continuous degradation of functionality above 5500-6000 meters, with the death zone starting around 7000. There is a good source from the US Army here. Admittedly, this is under the stress of military opeartions, but about 20% of military personnel seems to develop HAPE (potentially fatal bleeding in the lungs) operating over 5000 meters. Above 6500 meters, sleeping becomes very difficult, digesting food is near-impossible, and the risk of HAPE increases greatly. As far as vegetation goes, you're either in the nival (permanent snow) zone or in alpine desert territory. You're unlikely to get anything beyond lichen and maybe a few scattered grasses. It'll be mostly gravelly desert. Whether it will be ice or desert is determined by latitude and the prevailing winds. But to put things in perspective, even in a tropical context with wet winds you're likely in a alpine desert situation above 4500 meters or so. Obviously in temperate and boreal mountains the permanent ice cover will be much lower. 

This would be called sports. This caste would become professional athletes. In one sense, the original Olympic Games reflected preparation for war: hammer throw, spear throw, wrestling, running, jumping, shot put (strength), etc. Add more modern martial sports like archery, fencing, shooting, biathlon, etc. Add in orienteering (quickly moving over terrain with a map and compass), and more abstracted martial activities. Perhaps sports are restricted only to this caste. Perhaps these sports are restricted only to this caste and other castes only participate in others (badminton, baseball, soccer, table tennis, bowling). Or perhaps anyone can participate in these sports but only clans within this caste compete in the Olympics. It would be oriented towards the level of weapons that are known. If your society has firearms, target shooting, skeet shooting, paintball competition, etc, would directly contribute to military prowess. But being in great physical shape with high stamina, endurance of pain, eye-hand coordination, etc, would give you a huge advantage over more sedentary people. I'd have more problems trying to imagine a society in which no killings occur. Not even accidental (manslaughter)? Really? No one dropping something out a window onto someone's head? No one pushing someone in jest and the person falls down the stairs to their death? No one using the wrong ingredients in a food dish and accidentally poisoning someone? Not one single person getting angry and stabbing someone with a kitchen knife in a moment of passion? I can conceive of a world where murder is extremely rare and warfare doesn't happen, but... 

First of all, simultaneity is an ill-defined concept in the modern understanding of the universe, so realistically, the question can be answered with a simple no. Second of all, I'll assume we're talking different (and arbitrarily distant) galaxies in the same universe. When you bring in multiple universes, there's no good reason to assume the time dimension's arrow would be parallel and pointing in the same direction, so comparing times across universes wouldn't make much sense either (imagine one universe's time arrow as perpendicular to the other --- this actually happens inside event horizons of black holes.) But let's try to avoid answering no, because that's boring, right? Let's imagine some partial workarounds. On earth in the distant past, sailors would determine their position with reference to the stars. In the universe, you can use the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background to know how long it's been since the Big Bang, since it will decrease as time passes and the universe expands. With sufficiently accurate measurement, you can get arbitrarily precise results (down to a certain limit). Under a Newtonian framework, that would be a universal clock. However, in the real world, two observers using the CMB clock will assign perfectly reasonable times to a distant event (say observer A 'waving' from his galaxy to observer B on Earth), with the slight snafu that the times won't actually match. 

I don't think any one thing would do it, but a combination of things all together would. Giant turtleshells as bathtubs, coconut shells as helms, a man being loaded down with a single watermelon (I don't know what fruits are native to Indonesia, sorry), hunting through grazed grasses waist-high or higher, etc. Google image searching "Pygmy" has a lot of images, but in a quick look, I can't see anything obviously leaping out as a height cue. You can't tell how tall they are. The ocean, perhaps? "It was a balmy, windless day, the calm waves no more than a half his height". Another might be borrowed items. In a 3D computer game, it's hard to give the users a sense of scale. Familiar built objects are one such. So for the "Borrowers" series of books, showing that the items were repurposed human items worked well. In Pratchett's "Carpet People", the central conceit is again only slowly revealed, but the scale is greater, so in its way harder to grasp. Could your Floresiensians perhaps have some items from the Erectuses and Neanderthals? Edit: another thought: the square cubed law also works in reverse. Smaller characters can be far more elfin of feature and weight. They could be sticklike of proportion while still having whippet-like strength and speed. So they might have different modes of locomotion: they can scramble in the thinner twigs of trees, and in a forest, leap through the canopy with nimble ease, using the springiness of the trees to help: they needn't use the floor. Climbing trees, they can grasp the wrinkles of the bark, since they are light enough that bark is a realistic handhold. Some forms of undergrowth could become a "go through" instead of a "go round" thing (bramble thickets, etc). On the other hand, even a small stream or brook would be a swim for them instead of a paddle. 

I upvoted @Mormacil's answer, but let me give you an analogy that you may find useful. In some countries, you can refer to a building by a street address: 1854 Jackson Lane. You could find Jackson Lane and go in the correct direction and somewhere adjacent to 1853 and 1855 you'll find 1854. 

Actual naval warfare is constrained by a curved earth, air resistance, and the asymmetry of water and air. So aircraft carriers have a huge advantage over battleships, not because of swarms of small vehicles, per se, but because the small vehicles travel over the horizon. Similarly, submarines lurk under the surface and fire torpedoes that you can't really hit from a surface vessel. On the other hand, a laser in space can hit a distant target far faster than a physical projectile. Not to mention that carriers may become obsolete as hypersonic missiles and torpedoes are finally perfected. So maybe future battleships will launch these -- or maybe they'll all be launched from land bases and targeted via satellites. The ultimate space weapons are launched from enormous "vessels", where we might loosely define a huge device and an entire solar system as a "vessel". Look up Relativistic Weapons in the fascinating Exotic Weapons page. (The exotic weapons page is absolutely worth a read... be prepared to spend some time there.) These are the ultimate, unstoppable weapons for destroying entire planets. Small targets would be hard to hit with one, of course, so a swarm of small spaceships might take out your launcher, but if you get a first shot you'll destroy their planets with no chance of them defending. Lots of luck with them surviving in a bunch of little ships with their home planet(s) gone. Space is larger than the ocean. Even at some FTL speeds, it'll take you longer to get to a battle than the days or even weeks it takes a ship to cross the Pacific. Which tilts things towards larger ships, I would say.
