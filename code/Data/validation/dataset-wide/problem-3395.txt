You must be confused with unability to tell whether or not the vowel matters here. The examples do not provide sufficient information to judge whether or not the vowel plays any role. Simply because there are no consistency: cant be compared to . In order to make sure, ask your teacher to provide with samples starting with: 

There are also other colloquial question particles, but in neither case question mark is required. Nevertheless, some people would like using question marks to "stylize" their conversations. 

All cases occur when the speaker uses direct speech. Let's see what happens in each case. Inflections As far as I know, all Slavic languages retain gender-related inflections according to the original subject, as in Russian: 

I guess, you simply misunderstood. Using spoken language naturally requires both abilities, hearing and talking. Therefore, a person who has difficulty with any of these abilities (or both) is forced to use sign language. From the medical standpoint, hearing impairment at birth leads to inability to learn how to talk, so such people, even though their vocal tract is fully functional, may have difficulty to reproduce sounds of speech. However, there are modern training techniques simplifying the process of learning. 

@Eleshar's answer sums it up very well: “Good luck with separating some of the forms into morphemes”. Still, there's one important difference that makes it impossible to draw a straight parallel between classifiers (of isolating languages) and morphemes of inflexed languages. This is because in fusional languages, the modifier morphemes conjugate as well! Here's the story. When Lewis Carroll was traveling to Russia, he saw an interesting Russian word: . It means, "people who defend themselves". He wrote this word in his diary according to the English phonology: . Most likely, Carroll was marveled about the consonant which sounds unusual to an English speaker; we, instead, will dig into this word's morphology: 

Without loss of generality, let me focus on Thai speakers speaking English. While there is a broad set of initial consonants in Thai syllable, the final consonants are very limited. Namely, only voiceless plosives , nasals , and sonorants are available. The rest of the consonants, when in final position, are mapped to the eight ones above. That's why you can hear instead of "goal" (a football term), instead of "this", or instead of "beach". English words containing consonant clusters can also be distorted, either by "converting" consonants to syllables or by simply losing them. This is easy to notice when some Thai speakers say suffix denoting the plural number; the very word "words" can be pronounced , completely losing the final consonant. Note, no vowel → no syllable → no sound. Also, many distortion happens to R-colored vowels: "there" can convert to and so on. All listed phenomenons can be perceived by English speaker as chopping off the words at the end. 

Hence, all possible initial consonants (6 ones) and all possible vowels (4), minus six existing combinations = 6 * 4 - 6 = 18. Having 18 additional examples, you will be able to tell whether or not the vowel matters. With only 6 examples, the simplest rule applies, vowel does not matter. 

Unless knowing exact words, it may appear almost impossible to "build" the words from a root and affixes, even if you are familiar with their meanings. 

So, it just seems that cshu.org has incorrectly imported phonetic representation from electronic version of OED. Case closed. :) 

Armenian is one of such languages. More, it is one of the oldest languages known to be mostly phonemic. Quoting from here: 

but again, no reference to "fish". So, my question is, how to prove that Thai "fish" and Slavic "to swim" are relatives? 

The formal description has been already given in the excellent @ColinFine's answer. Let me give a different description in "layman terms". Mongolian characters usually have four distinct forms: isolate, initial, medial, and final. Vowels and have exactly the same glyphs in their final form. Here are the four forms for and , correspondingly. Note, both have two versions of final glyphs: 

A language with a certain degree of inflection is called synthetic language. The subsets are highly inflected and weakly inflected. A synthetic language which has derivational morphology so that the complex words become synthesized by concatenation of unchanged morphemes is called agglutinative language. If the bound morphemes serve several roles at once (e.g., person+case or gender+time) and therefore change, that would be a fusional language. In the above cases, the prefixes are not considered separately because usually, all types of affixes serve the common role in the morphology. 

In Thai, calling people as they were your relatives, is a linguistic norm. Here are some details first: 

Note that the "unofficial" pronunciation is very close to a decomposed written form, e.g. , , etc. I have also found a hypothesis expressed by Nantana Danvivathana in their book The Thai Writing System, page 188. Quoting: 

It's not because of nouns. It's because of "things" and "relations". Adjectives define attributes of things (nouns, pronouns, etc.) Adverbs define attributes of relations, where relations can be actions (verbs) or other attributes (adjectives or adverbs). P.S. Yet again, sorry for a rather philosophic answer than a linguistic one. I'm sure I'm not the first to suggest this, but I'm sincerely not aware about any academic researches over this matter. 

As every piece of software, it can be confused by some awkward contexts and phraseologic constructs, but in general it works fine. As of how to write your own one, most likely, you will need: 

3. Subsequently, this term moved towards self-propelled sea mines that have been invented in 1870's. 4. Before 20th century, cars looked rather like horse carts. With the progress of automobile technology and car racing, the designers equipped their cars with cigar-shaped bodies. 

If a stranger's age and social status looks like he/she could be your elder brother/sister, call them พี่ . If their age is equal to yours, use the same word for politeness. 

The bigrams for it would be: "I ate", "ate a", "a green", "green apple". Note there can be funnier bigrams like "I ??? a", "ate ??? green", "a ??? apple". The trigrams are: "I ate a", "ate a green", and "a green apple". You have actually started moving this way. Computing a word frequency is essentially an unigram, a corner case of n-grams where the order of Markov chain equals to zero. A single word along with its weight is an unigram by itself. Step 1, analyzing the corpus Say, your corpus contains 30M phrases and 30 of them contain a word pair "green apple". The bigram would be like: 

For further details, I would recommend this great lesson by Stuart Jay Raj: Not Just You and Me - Getting past Khun คุณ Phom ผม and ดิฉัน DiChan in Thai (Youtube) 

Just to coin one more way to express inclusive OR versus exclusive OR. In Ukrainian, we use "or X, or Y" construct to denote exclusivity: 

Chinese speakers tend to minimize phonetic distance between the tones. No, I don't say they ignore it. They only emphasize tones when needed (e.g., the context allows a different word pronounced in another tone). Thai is the opposite. Native speakers highlight the tones pretty accurately. 

A typical approach to pronouncing final consonants is adding a short Schwa after it and then practicing with gradual shortening the vowel to the minimal possible length. I have no academic books on this topic, but I have personal experience teaching my Thai friends how to pronounce English final consonants. In Thai language, a considerable amount of consonant sounds can't be final in the syllable, so average people have difficulty even with seemingly easy final , , or even voiced plosives — while, obviously, having no problem with these consonants as initial ones in the syllable. This technique has helped me a lot.
