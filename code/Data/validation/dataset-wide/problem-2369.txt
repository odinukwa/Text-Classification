A lot of timber gets harvested in the winter, especially now that you can harvest timber from the comfort of the heated cab of a harvester. Falling trees in the winter does the least amount of damage to the trees, the ground, and surrounding vegetation, it also makes it easier to haul the logs out because they just slide across the snow. The cold helps with the curing of the wood too. The moisture content in the tree is low to begin with, and it dries out slow as you wait out the rest of winter and ease into the warmer months. 

PBSS? A variation I'll often use when there isn't too much drag in the system involves keeping BOTH hands on the rope under the belay device, and never letting go of the rope. I start with both hands holding the brake. When I pull, I pull up with both hands to take out the slack, then brake with both hands, slide the top hand up, then slide the bottom hand up, and repeat. This works well on belays where the rope isn't dragging on the rock, but as soon as you get some friction in the system you need to let go with that one hand to help pull the rope down. 

Girth Hitch I think the knot you're using is appropriate if the idea is not to lose your kit, another knot may run you the risk of losing something because it came untied without your blessing. If you're using cheap cord, then don't bother with the knot if it's giving you grief, just cut it at the knot, your cord will get shorter each time, but it still usable for a couple cuts. If you want to be able to attach something to your bag or belt quickly without fiddling with your knots, then I recommend simply girth hitching it: 

I think your best bet would be to look at their other National Parks, Vatnajökull is the biggest (It covers 13% of Iceland), but apparently Snæfellsjökull National Park is Iceland's main attraction: 

Toss the middle first. Throwing your rope isn't always the best solution. High winds, trees, and rocky slopes can make it easy for you to get your rope hung up. Throwing your rope is only really advisable if you're on a steep vertical cliff and there's little or no risk of getting your rope hung up on anything. When you do throw your rope though, it's best to flake it into at least four separate coils; two coils for each strand. Coil the middle, then coil the end of each strand. When you throw, throw one strand at a time. For each strand, throw out the middle coil first, then throw the end after, this way you can better direct where you want your rope to go. In situations where you don't expect you can throw the rope without making a mess, then it's best to let your rope out as you go down. Flake your rope out into a sling on your side as shown below: $URL$ 

The answers is to simply get a proper 4 season tent designed for camping in the winter. There's a reason why 4 season tents are different than 3 season tents, and that reason is because the weather and temperature of that fourth season (winter) is much harsher than the other three. You are not going to find a 3 season tent that performs as well as a 4 season. 4 seasons have a much more durable fly to protect them from the elements, and are devoid of screen vents which let in drafts and let warm air out. Many are constructed with a double wall to help insulate the tent. In general, 4 season tents are significantly warmer than 3 season tents. You don't have to break the bank buying a 4 season tent, take the MEC TVG for example, It's a professional quality 2 person mountain expedition tent that goes for $339 Canadian dollars, which comes out to only $257 USD at current market prices. 

What you described is certainly an option, I imagine when you said you were belaying between your feet, that you had an equalized anchor in the crack, and were possibly sitting nearer to the tree, tied into the anchor using a locking carabiner and clove hitch while belaying between your legs like the illustration below. 

I would recommend using a double figure eight I always use this knot when tying off the end of the rope, it's stronger, safer, and it's easier to untie. 

There are at least two types of dry ropes, those that have a single dry coating, and those that are "double-dry", they've had both their sheath and their cores coated. Single dry ropes typically are only coated on their sheaths, but the coating tends to wear off quickly, so some manufacturers use a single treatment that penetrates to the core. The terminology doesn't seem to be consistent, some distributers only categorize ropes as dry or non-dry, others add categories like dry-core, dry core and sheath, or 2X dry. But the difference is just how many times the ropes are treated to be water resistant. 

There are really only two main considerations for hammock camping: the first is hanging the hammock (trees); the second is whether or not it will be warm enough to sleep in a hammock (temperature). Hammocks are great at keeping you cool, so they are best suited for sleeping in hot humid environments where there are plenty of trees to hang it from, and where you aren't going to get cold at night. I've been camping with people who have brought their department store hammocks out into the Canadian Rockies, they had no problems with finding trees to hang them from, but they froze at night when the temperature dropped to nearly zero. There are of course hammock systems suitable for sleeping in cooler climates, but there's a learning curve, you can't simply apply what you know about ground sleeping to sleeping in a hammock. There's a lot of convective heat loss in a hammock, particularly from below, whereas in ground sleeping you're more concerned with conductive heat loss against the ground. The solution in hammock camping is to put blankets on your bottom: 

Slip knot will work fine, but if you want a more secure knot then I would probably recommend the Poachers knot. It's essentially a slip knot tied with a double overhand instead of a single. 

If it ain't broke don't fix it. These's only one real guideline for sharpening anything, and that is to sharpen things when they get dull. If your edges aren't dull, or dinged, or rusty, then they likely don't need to be serviced. Inspect your bases and edges for any nicks or gouges regularly, if you take your board or skis to the shop to get waxed they typically sharpen them at the same time. When I sharpen my skis I check the edges with the backs of my thumbnail. If the edge shaves bits of nail off–then it's sharp, if not–then it's dull. Typically the biggest indicator that it's time to service your board or skis is when things don't feel like they're going well anymore while you ride. Or you've hit a big rock or stump and you've done damage to your bases. That's if you're a casual recreational rider. If you're a serious racer, then you're probably going to get your skis serviced before every race. 

Connect the hooks to the short lines to the main line by first feeding the dropper loops through the perfection loops, then the hooks through the dropper loops, just like putting a new leader on your float line. 

We have one spot under our back deck where Robin's make a nest every year, last year we had a nest with five eggs: 

Andrew Irvine's body was not found unfortunately, and he was the one who was carrying the camera. There have been other expeditions to retrieve bodies off of the mountain, there is a foundation in Nepal dedicated to cleaning up Mt. Everest, and to date have retrieved tonnes of garbage off of the mountain, and they collect some bodies as well, but most people request that the bodies of their fallen loved ones be left on the mountain. For the Most part, extractions are impossible due to the extremes of being at such high elevation, and bodies are left exactly where they fell if they died in the death zone, except for bodies which lay right on the trail, those ones tend to get pushed over the side of the mountain, or they're left on the side of the trail and the 200km/h winter winds will blow them off the edge in the off season, the rest just stay where they are, and will likely remain there, preserved for years to come (just like George). There are over 200 bodies on everest, and that number keeps climbing every year as people line up to go die on the highest summit on Earth. 

I had a campfire discussion not long ago with a man that got pulmonary edema while attempting the summit of Aconcagua, and we got into the discussion of the effects of high elevation. I had always assumed that after you adapted to the thin air, the risk to your body was how thick your blood got with the production of extra red blood cells to compensate for the lack of oxygen. The thicker blood making frostbite and edema more likely because of poor blood flow, and heart attacks and strokes more likely because of increased chances of forming blood clots. But my friend said it had less to do with thick blood and more to do with the lack of air pressure... What does low pressure do to you? What exactly happens to your body at high altitude? 

This will depend a lot on the individual. Some people may be able to acclimatize quickly, others will not. In parts of Western Canada the temperature is regularly +30°C in the Summer and -30°C in the winter, so the people here have to adapt to both extremes every year. How effectively you adapt to the climate often depends on your upbringing. Your body learns to adapt to its environment pretty well while it's developing, so kids raised in an environment will have a much easier time adapting to that environment than an adult who moves from one environment to another. It may be possible for some people to train their bodies to adapt to a colder environment at a quicker rate, but in my opinion freezing your butt off in shorts to adapt to the cold quicker is less about adaptation and more about relativity. A classic example is the kid who complains about the house being cold. Their tough-love daddy sends them outside in the freezing cold for a few minutes, then when they come inside the house suddenly feels a lot warmer than it did before they went outside. Your friend might think he's adapting to the cold, but really he's just freezing himself to the point that when he puts his good layers on they feel way warmer than he remembers. One way to help control your body temperature is to watch the number of calories you consume. Food is like fuel on the fire, if you're cold, eat more, if you're too hot, don't eat as much; your body will allocate the calories appropriately. I eat way more in the winter than I do in the summer. There's lots of times in the summer where I won't eat at all because it's too hot, but this may be because my body has adapted to converting a lot of calories into body heat in the winter times. As a cold climate dweller, and an ice climber, I don't try to fight the cold, I defend against it, if I'm cold, I dress up or eat something and move around to warm up. No one I know indulges in any kind of "exposure" or "temperature" training foolishness. 

A bell curve simply measures your median level of climbing ability in your gym. The "science" behind it is simply to cater to your customers, you need to set routes to attract the biggest demographic to your gym, which for most gyms is in the easy to intermediate range. At my local wall, one of the ways we would determine the "median" of our climbing demographic was during our Everest Challenge event. Hundreds of people would climb day and night to climb the elevation of Everest on the wall, and track which ropes they were climbing, and how many times they climbed them. At the end of the event it was easy for us to look at the data to see which ropes were climbed the most, and determine which grade most people were climbing. The route setters would then know which grade of routes they needed to set more of. I set routes for years at my university gym and for competitions. I can tell you it's easy to set easy routes, and easy to set really hard routes, but to set intermediate routes inside that curve at the level where the majority of your climbers abilities are - is quite difficult. I'll give you an example: Easy route = Bunch of big jugs close together in a ladder up the wall, there you go kids. Hard route = A few garbage holds that are hard/hurt to grab and move off of; or, a series of really strenuous moves that the average person can't piece together without lots of core strength, training, and a lot of screaming. Intermediate route (your bell curve routes) = trying to balance between easy and hard, without giving the stronger climbers the ability to dyno through half your route, bypassing many of the holds and ultimately reducing the difficulty rating of the route. The ultimate challenge in setting intermediate routes lies in forcing beta. It's almost like a chess game, where you're trying to plan ahead in order to force your opponent to make the moves you want them to make. Forcing moves in a climbing route at an intermediate level is the hardest part of route setting, and takes a lot of experience, skill, and imagination. I would spend hours working on a single move in some routes, making it almost impossible to pass that section without using the exact beta I had intended them to use. The move wouldn't be that complicated, but if you didn't use it your balance would get thrown off to the point you could keep a grip on your other holds. Ultimately though, someone always manages to find a different beta to bypass a section, even if the move is more strenuous than the prescribed beta, and causes them injury in the process. One thing I would do to force people to think about their footwork is use garbage holds like two-finger pocket holds in places where stronger climbers would normally cut their feet and campus through cruxes. I figured the threat of blowing a tendon would be incentive for them to change their climbing style, and actually spend some time figuring out the beta I had intended for them to use. Alas, instead of using their heads to solve the problem using a series of less strenuous moves, they would shove their fingers in the pockets, pull hard and shred flesh trying to dyno past half the holds. The "curve" for each gym is going to vary place to place, and will be determined by the demographic of climbers that frequent the gym. Each gym may employ its own method for determining how many of each grades need to be set, some will simply be at the mercy of whomever sets the routes and the style of climbing they favour.
