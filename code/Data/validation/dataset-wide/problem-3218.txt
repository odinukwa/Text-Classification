Stalin want "secure" borders for Russia. To the south, that meant parts of Turkey, at least the "Straits," and part of the Balkans, say Bulgaria to secure them, plus parts of Persia, all the way to the Persian Gulf, according to sources such as the Molotov-Schulenburg talks, quoted in sources like William L. Shirer's "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich." These were far beyond Russian imperialist borders. To offset this, Stalin was willing to accept "less" in the west than the Russian borders. He was willing to "horse trade" parts of Poland, e.g. Warsaw, and even LIthuania held by the Russian Czars. What he wanted most was the Pripet Marshes, and the forest along and in front of them, for defense. 

The Confederates were better at keeping units up to full strength, both by replacements, and by "merging" units. (This was managed at a regimental, not company level.) At the battle of Gettysburg, for instance, there were seven Union Corps versus three Confederate Corps, but the ratio of Union to Confederate troops was 7 to 6, not 7 to 3, because the Union Corps were at half strength (or less), while the Confederate corps were close to full strength. Union troop shortfalls were legendary; the First Minnesota Regiment had an original strength of 1,000, went into Gettysburg with 264, and left the battle with 47, before it was finally merged with another unit. Josh Chamberlain's 20th Maine started with 1000, and went to Gettysburg with just over 200, before it was offered 120 deserters from other Maine regiments. (Chamberlain talked 117 of those men into joining his unit.) One reason was that Confederate state governors were tasked with sending men to the central army, while Union state governors were tasked with sending regiments. So Confederate regiments could be "filled out" as long as state governments met their manpower "quotas." Union governors sent raw new regiments while old regiments went shorthanded. This changed only after 1863 when the Union instituted the draft and had a central "pool" of men. Then, they worked around the state quota problem by combining units from more than one state, and funneling draftees into these "mixed" units. 

King Louis VII was probably one such king. His first wife, Eleanor of Acquitaine (in)famously complained that he was "more of a monk than a man." When they got married (as teenagers), he donated her wedding gift, a valuable rock crystal vase, to the St. Denis Basilica (church). 

The music of the Ming Dynasty was a "throwback" to ancient Kun Qu music that went back roughly two millennia, to before the Birth of Christ. It was a deeper, sadder kind of music that the lively music favored by the Yuan (Mongol) dynasty. It harkened to a time when people lived barely on the edge of subsistence (most of China had advanced beyond that by the mid first Millennium, or what the Europeans call the Dark Ages), except that the Ming Dynasty was one of the more tragic dynasties in relatively modern Chinese histories. The idea of needing sacrifices to appease the gods was an element of Ming music, and notably absent from culture of other modern Chinese dynasties, while being a "staple" of the ancient ones, as well as many other non-Chinese cultures from before the birth of Christ. 

Bruce Lee was a Martial Arts instructor who was also a successful actor that popularized Martial Arts in the United States through film. This popularity extended to Latin America as well. $URL$ "Adios Bruce Lee" is a tribute to him because of his untimely death, at the age of 32 from brain swelling brought about by an allergy or reaction to a particular medication. It was made by an Argentinian producer, and Adios means goodbye. 

I am writing as the author of "A Modern Approach to Graham and Dodd Investing. Published in 2004, the book discussed the 1929 crash and predicted another one (which occurred in 2008-2009). It also provided a road map of how "other events" caused the fallout from the 1929 crash to turn into the Great Depression, and why the absence of such events have (so far) failed to produce a similar result this time around. From page 314: 

A carrier strike group consisting of a single carrier is a peacetime construct. This is enough for patrolling and "power projection" purposes. The U.S. Navy has basically been at "peace" since the end of World War II (some land bombardment in the Korean War, but no naval battles), and of course, during the Interwar period. Groups with multiple carriers formed up in World War II because reserves were needed against enemy "first strike" capabilities. Hopefully, a U.S. fleet wouldn't lose all of its (multiple) carriers at the same time. My guess is that we will see a return to multi-carrier groups if there is another major (naval) war. 

Even as monarchs go, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor was one lucky individual. He inherited Austria and the job of Holy Roman Emperor, as well as the Netherlands (including Belgium) through his father, whose parents were Maximilian of Austria and Marie of Burgundy (this province, but not the Netherlands, was lost to the French). On his mother's side, he inherited Spain through her parents, Ferdinand and Isabella. When Charles V abdicated, he divided his holdings, with his brother Ferdinand inheriting Austria and the Holy Roman Empire. His son, Philip II, received Spain (which had come through Charles' mother), and the Netherlands (which had come through Charles' father). Why did Charles V divide his Empire at all? Did the Spanish and German sides have trouble getting along? More to the point, why did he give the Netherlands, which had come through the German side of the family to Philip, along with Spain, instead of to Ferdinand, when the Holy Roman Empire was at least contiguous to the Netherlands? (Spain was not.) 

Perhaps the earliest attempt to free Negro slaves (at least within their jurisdiction) was by the Quakers of Pennsylvania, late in the eighteenth century. "Abolitionist" reformers picked up the pace early in the nineteenth century. Perhaps the most famous of them was William Lloyd Garrison, whose first issue of the Liberator in 1831 opened, "I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation.... I am in earnest—I will not excuse—I will not retreat a single inch—AND I WILL BE HEARD." $URL$ Another famous abolitionist in the 1840s and 1850s was the preacher Henry Ward Beecher, and his even more famous sister, Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Lincoln's election was the culmination of a situation where abolitionists like the ones mentioned above had won the support of perhaps half the country. 

Serfdom and feudalism aren't the same, but they are related. Feudalism is a system of land grants given by kings to high nobles, subdivided by these nobles to petty nobles, subdivided by petty nobles to large "gentleman" farmers, etc. thereby creating a landed hierarchy. What makes feudalism work is serfdom, that is, tying peasants to the land on which they were born and work on. If peasants were free to come and go, land would lose much of its value, thereby undermining feudalism. 

Many Nazis did fight on the front lines, if for no other reason than that their party status depended on that fact. For instance, the fiercest graduates of the Hitler Jugend were put into the Waffen SS divisions, where they were given the most critical assignments, but also the highest priority for equipment and supply. Other, more senior members of the Nazi party were "too critical," either in actual fact, or under pretense, to the civilian leadership or management to be used on the front. 

Bogdan Khmelnytsky was arguably the "William Wallace" of the Ukraine. He not only took on the one noble, but the whole Polish noble "Establishment," to the point where even the King of Poland (a personal friend), wouldn't defend him. So he basically started a war between his Cossacks and the Poles. He was initially successful but the Poles were unforgiving; they wanted his head and continued the war, which started to turn in their favor. This drove him and Ukraine into the arms of Russia, and helped set the stage for Poland's decline and Russia's rise. 

Short answer: Because sailors spent a lot of time in or near tropical latitudes (where rum was most available), protecting the "sea lanes,"(or raiding them, in the case of pirates). As another poster pointed out, rum was made from sugar, a tropical product. It's true that rum could be manufactured in northern latitudes, but those products were largely bound for Africa in the Triangle (slave) trade. Rum could also be manufactured "locally" (near the sources of sugar). Most (European) soldiers, on the other hand, fought and spent most of their time in nothern (mostly European) latitudes. It didn't make sense to "import" rum from the tropics when "scotch, whiskey, and vodka" were available. 

I would date the transition to aircraft carrier domination to the Battle of Midway, in June 1942. The Japanese fought an old style battle in four ship waves. In the first wave as a carrier task force, plus supporting cruisers and battleships, whose main task was to soften up Midway by air bombardment, and then screen the rest of the Japanese fleet. In the second wave was a supporting force of four cruisers. In the third wave were the transports, escorted mainly by battleships and cruisers. And the fourth wave contained three of Japan's largest battleships, which was supposed to deliver the coup de grace to the American fleet, after it presumably rushed to save Midway. After the destruction wrought at Pearl Harbor, the Americans had only one "wave," a carrier task force of three aircraft carriers and supporting cruisers, roughly equivalent in strength to Japan's first wave alone. The battle degenerated into an air to ship battle, along lines similar to those of Coral Sea, fought a month earlier. With their greater focus, the Americans sank all four Japanese aircraft carriers, while the Japanese, who had been concentrating on Midway at the expense of watching out for American carriers, sank only one. (Two, if you count the temporary destruction of Midway as a "carrier.") The surviving American carriers then stayed out of sea range of the Japanese battleships, but the Japanese didn't dare to invade Midway while the Americans had carrier aircraft within air range. This battle proved the dominance of carrier based aircraft over ships. Carriers had proven their worth at Coral Sea, but it was considered a "fluke" because no battleships had been involved. At Midway, Japanese battleships were present and had their "chance," but basically chose not to fight. 

At that time, Ukraine was under the control of the Soviet Union. And the Russians basically controlled the Soviet Union. So they basically controlled Ukraine. Thus, the transfer of Crimea to the Ukraine was a "Greek" gift that would enable the Russians to control Ukraine better. Since it was on their "books," the Ukrainians would have to manage it, while the Russians would de facto control it. Not a bad idea, as long as Ukraine in fact remains your colony. 

From the 15th to 20th centuries, the Moroccans had a love-hate relationship (but mostly the former) with the Ottoman Empire. For most of that period, they could get trade goods from India and the rest of Asia through the Ottomans (Saracens) by land. They felt no need to explore for alternate sea routes to "India." 

Mountain roads are "best" built along ridge lines that minimize (to the extent possible), the surface area of the mountains containing the roads to minimize the necessary excavation. This, in turn, is dictated by the process of building the road through the parts of the mountain, where the slopes are the "minimum." At its heart, the Great Wall is just a long "road" with walls on both sides. You can see from the pictures that the mountains on either side tend to have steeper slopes than the ridges through which the wall is actually built. These ridges are the points of minimal slope changes. (Think of these slopes as "hypotenuses" over the x axis with the ideal slope being zero.) A path that was "straight line" (as the crow flies) would usually violate the above rule, and therefore be inefficient in a real environment, even though it would look "optimal" on a map. So a wall with appropriate "bends" will "take less material and guards to defend [than] if it had taken a straighter path." 

"Defense in depth" was the key to winning, after the earliest battles. With a "long thin line," you will either "kill or be killed" at the first shock of battle. That's how wargames play, but not how warfare was conducted by the time of the Greeks and Romans. The Romans won mainly because they "outlasted" almost everyone else. With their training and experience, they would want battles to last a whole day, and hope that the other side breaks first, instead of staking all on the first contact. Their system of rotating troops was the best for their time, and they used "checkerboard" formations to advantage. Other armies weren't as efficient in this regard, and they fell apart sooner. 

That's a bit like saying, why did no Prime Minister of England marry into the royal family to merge the two? It could happen of course, but it is not likely to, because of "jealousy" on both sides. Let's look at the possible permutations as they may have occurred in Japan: 1) The Shogun, or one of his sons, marries the Emperor's oldest daughter. Women couldn't inherit the throne in Japan, so it would have gone to the Emperor's oldest natural son, or if necessary, the Emperor's oldest adopted son. 2) The Emperor or Crown Prince marries the Shogun's eldest daughter. That doesn't much work either. The Shogun is basically the country's chief warlord. Barring some once-per-millenninum exception (e.g. China's Wu Zhao or CiXi), women didn't make good warlords in the "old days." 3) The Emperor and Shogun "marry." Not possible before "modern" times, and its tolerance for same-sex marriages. 4) The Emperor adopts the Shogun as his son. That might actually be possible, but only if the Emperor had no other male heirs. The "ancients" were all conscious of their family lines, and most Emperors (and Shoguns) would shrink from "corrupting" theirs in this way. It's true that the Minamoto Shogun line was a "branch" of the royal family. That would represent a de-merger of the two, which is a more logical result (given the laws of entropy). It's easier for a "distant" member of the royal family to "parachute" into the Shogunate, than it is for the Shogun to "rise" to Imperial Rank. To use the English example, suppose Prince William eventually became King of England, while Prince Harry "resigned" from the Royal Family, ran for a seat in the House of Commons, and later became Prime Minister. That is a much more plausible scenario than some Prince Minister, call her Margaret, marrying Prince George in the royal family. (Most people become Prime Ministers at much older age than royal heirs to the throne marry.)
