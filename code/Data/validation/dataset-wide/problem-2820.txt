Namely, there seems to be something jumbled about what happens in 3. I would probably formulate this type of argument as follows: 

In philosophy, fallacies relate to arguments which are composed of claims (a claim is something that can be either true or false). A fallacy is either a violation of formal rules of inference (a fallacy in formal logic) or more loosely one of a myriad of argumentative strategies that are considered erroneous (fallacies in critical thinking or "informal logic"). But in both cases, fallacies occur in claims or in the structure of the argument. So, there's one problem with the locution "fallacious question" which is that philosophical arguments are not composed of questions. The closest I can think of among the fallacies to what you are saying is a "straw man." A straw man occurs when someone attributes to you a ridiculous argument and then shows that this argument is invalid -- and then uses to claim your own position is invalid. The best I can imagine is that it may have a name in rhetoric or debate. 

(I take it that the new first sentence is not supposed to be a result based on the next two sentences, but just that author telling you what they are about to tell you.) But the second example cannot be similarly rephrased. It's hard to see that any sentence could rightfully be said to "follow" from another, instead of just providing more detail. 

So to keep people from being stressed, we should give them control. If we didn't have P2, we wouldn't be able to conclude that the people with control and no heart disease did not still have high stress. (They might have high stress and no heart disease because they're physically fit, for instance.) Then we wouldn't be able to say that having control meant not having stress. This is equivalent to not being able to assert that having stress meant not having control. 

A quick skim through the "Inorganic Physics" section of Hegel's Encyclopedia shows 5 separate paragraphs with reference to Newton, and all of them are disparaging. If there's a real philosophical justification for the hate I cannot find it. No argument seems to come out of the criticism. But it's Hegel after all, so there's always the possibility of something more. Why did Hegel oppose Newton so strongly? Can this shed any light at all on the Encyclopedia, or is it just a strange personal quirk? 

At the most basic level, they differ in terms of what they are analyzing. We'll work with your example (in part): It is wrong to kill someone. A consequentialist theory tells you something is right or wrong based on either the intended or actual consequences. In its classical Utilitarian articulation, it also include a "harm principle" that prohibits harming others in the process of maximizing pleasure. But this harm principle is not justified in terms of maximization -- thus showing one potential problem for these theories. Looking at it "it is wrong to kill someone," the consequentialist says this when there is a negative consequence relative to the valuable commodity lost in killing someone. On such an account, it is conceivable that killing someone could be not merely licensed but morally praiseworthy or possibly even obligatory. A deontological theory says actions are right or wrong based on whether or not they express the completion of duties or not. Looking at "it is wrong to kill someone," the deontologist tells us that it is wrong because killing someone violates a duty -- either to oneself or to others (possibly including God). On such an account, if killing is wrong as a violation of a fundamental duty, it is always wrong. (It could also be wrong on more contingent grounds -- I promised not to kill you until next week Tuesday so I have a duty to my word and to your promise). A virtue account generally asks whether they allow the person to flourish and grow. Here, the virtue account tells us it is wrong to kill someone because of how this warps the character of the person and how it fails to demonstrate excellence in response to one's emotions or thoughts. There's a lot of different virtue theories so it's going to be hard to nail down what "virtue theory" says as to when/why it's wrong to kill someone. Given these basic sketches, one could see virtue accounts a species of consequentialism centered on a certain idea of the person and its excellence. It's going to be much harder to draw deontology into a consequentialism but it can be done by suggesting that what we are maximizing is the completion of duty. But it won't be identical because you're still evaluating differently when looking at the morality of actions. 

EDIT: For any future readers: I've picked virmaior's answer as I think it answers the question fullest but Patrick R's answer is also great and gives some very useful context about the translation. 

Unjust prayers You correctly note that God , even when such a prayer entails injustice. This is however not a problem with prayer but rather our flawed application of it. Of course God will not grant a prayer for an unjust action; such a wish is, I think, probably to be counted as a sin. Prayer generally But of course these are not the only kinds of prayers. The more interesting question is, why pray at all? After all, God has perfect knowledge, and God's will is immutable, so if you are in the kind of trouble that God would help you with, God is already knows about it and is already either going to help you or not. From Aquinas's Summa Theologica, Part 2.2, Question 83, On Prayer, Article 2, Whether it is becoming to pray?: 

Infinite Thought, Introduction by Oliver Feltham and Justin Clemens, p 25. There's a bit of a mistake here, because (p 24, itself citing Being and Event 146) 

I will try to reword that here. Hegel maintains that an act of will requires the self to make itself particular (thus denying premise 4). It's a bit hard to follow but the basic idea is that to will something requires having a particular objective and that to have a particular object means that the self must also take up a particular position. In the process, the thing we will loses the formal nature that makes it universal. An analogy might help, in a sense, someone can will "to get a girlfriend" and that seems pretty broad, but the moment he wills towards getting any particular girlfriend, he's not willing an idea that's universal but a particular thing. Moreover (as Philip Kl√∂cking helpfully notes), Hegel believes this permeates the activity of the will. When the will engages in acts of willing, it always does so by selecting an object and thus restricting itself. Thus, for Hegel, will is by definition finite. For Hegel, this is particular bad because the human self is Spirit (a technical term for Hegel) which is unlimited and infinite. And it can achieve this unlimited and infinite nature only in knowing the infinite (this is a central claim of his Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion but is made explicit several times between pages 200 and 300). Hegel's denial of premise 4 is an en passant move in his larger denial of premise 3! Interestingly, Hegel thinks that we can know the infinite specifically as God, and that the mistake is to know God as a particular. In the process, the self qua thinking Spirit is at one with the object of Spirit (rather than being up and against an object as in the case particular acts of will). 

It's obvious that relative wonder is compatible with a scientific perspective. My first instinct was to say that Dawkins only feels relative wonder, while Keats feels absolute wonder. But I don't think that has to be true. There's a way in which the scientist's rainbow is no longer absolutely wonderful. One of the great things about rainbows is that they don't require any analysis; just look at them and you'll feel joy. The experience is sort of unmediated. But then look at the rainbow through the eyes of a physicist. The rainbow is no longer mysterious and no longer experienced unmediated. That's not to say a physicist can't enjoy rainbows; they can, but not in the same way as usual while they are investigating its electromagnetic properties. But I think Keats goes too far if he says that science must destroy miracles. Instead it can defer them. The miraculous thing is no longer: Look, a rainbow!, but: Look, the amazing intricacies of refraction and wave motion! This may well be the wonder Dawkins is describing. I know some mathematicians who feel the same way. To your last thought: On what principled grounds can we say rainbows are wonderful but the US tax code is not? I'm not sure that any exist, but do we need them? It doesn't seem to me that there's an exact science of wonder. Nor should there be. Part of the wonder of wonders is their fuzziness, the way they appeal to me, not some lifeless objective standard. 

I am not claiming this is definite insofar as again the question is whether Hegel thinks that this only occurs when the state is actualized, but if he thinks he has grasped the concept of the state without its actuality (i.e., with what is presented in this text), then there's a problem with that claim in the Hegelian system. To reword that, this passage suggests either that 

I think what you are fundamentally running up against is "what is the definition of justice?" because you are asking whether or not we should try to achieve equality as a goal in our morality. There are two discussions that come to mind for me. First, in Plato's Republic, there's the discussion of justice and whether justice for the society is bigger than justice for the individual (BK II). The relevance is that for Plato a big question is what is justice and how to define. On the majority reading, the answer given by the text is that justice is a well-ordered society. But there's also a minority reading that questions whether Plato is saying justice for more people is better (and that the small village offered in BK I is superior to the Republic offered in the rest of the text). Second, Mill spends a good portion of Utilitarianism arguing about the nature of justice and trying to find a way to maximize. For him, justice is happiness maximization with harm minimization. But he also argues that this is the real content of everyone else's ideas about justice. As with Plato, Mill seems to want to say this is the most happiness for the most people. But again, the question is why? Regarding Plato's account, Aristotle is critical of one feature that might matter -- which is that Plato's account eliminates private relationships and imagines care for children will still happen. At one point in the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle argues that this is nonsense because we care most for that which is our own. In a sense, Aristotle is the first economist because he recognizes that we act for our own benefit and profit and would not do so if it did not exist. There are a number of reasons why people want equality in terms of goods. I would suspect some of it stems from equality in terms of rights. Here, the issue is that if rights are rights to do specific things, then poor people have less rights than rich people. Of course, we are not obligated to accept this definition of rights. A second reason can be that we believe slavery is wrong. For some people, they believe one person's profit is at the expense / enslavement of others, so they will maintain that the government should make things just again by redistributing (obviously this is a hackneyed presentation and believers in equality in terms of wealth will have more precise accounts of how the current arrangement is leading to exploitative growth). 

which is even worse. Unfortunately truth is defined inside a particular language. Therefore we cannot tell within the language itself which one is in the wrong: or any one of to . Instead of throwing out particular theorems because they are paradoxical, we throw out sets of rules that generate those theorems. The new set of rules in the case of set theory had the axiom of restricted comprehension which avoids the problem. 

We shouldn't consider the purely economic strain of Marxist thought because it does indeed seem to have been debunked. The labor theory of value is simply false, so his prophecies have not come to pass. The revolution was supposed to be a historical necessity, even if not a historical inevitability, and yet while it has not happened, other world-historical events have. Plus workers are not necessarily paid merely what they need to survive. We (well, I) no longer live in industrial, but rather post-industrial nations, and Marx could not possibly have foreseen post-industrialism. Wikipedia seems to think the last big thing in the field was done by Kautsky, so my feelings are perhaps not uncommon. I highly recommend pursuing intersectional studies as well as decolonization. For the latter Frantz Fanon is particularly well regarded - The Wretched of the Earth is a good place to start. For the former, Simone de Beauvoir's Second Sex is rightfully a classic of feminist philosophy. It isn't strictly speaking Marxist but certainly builds on Marxist logic, e.g., the way material circumstances shape ideas - in this case, woman's oppression being internalized. Her work has been much improved-upon. I'd recommend, to start, Judith Butler and Patricia Collins. Collins' Black Feminist Thought is an ideal introduction to third-wave, intersectional feminism. (See also this.) Butler is a dense, maybe inaccessible writer who owes a lot to Derrida. Her main claim is that gender is performative---see Gender Trouble. Politics: Badiou is a Maoist and metaphysician who tries to tie the two together. His main work is Being and Event, but it's pretty dense and uses a lot of set theory. If you just want to get a handle on how he thinks Manifesto for Philosophy is probably a better call. Toni Negri (with Michael Hardt) wrote the landmark Empire, which draws on a lot of the work done by others on this list. It's about modern-day imperialism and contains a strong critique of dialectics and mediation as tools for thought. And finally we have ideology/culture generally. Gramsci's Prison Notebooks are on this front far ahead of their time. Adorno and Althusser are chronologically the next step, but I haven't read too much of either. Supposedly "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses" is quite good, and that's by Althusser. As for Adorno (with Horkheimer), you'll want Dialectic of Enlightenment, though you have to take the bits on jazz with a grain of salt. Finally there are Foucault and Zizek. It's hard to know what Foucault's actual political beliefs are but he is entirely in debt to Marx and Nietzsche for his genealogical account of oppression. No matter what your interests are you should read Discipline and Punish. Zizek is controversial because he's still alive and sometimes he says really tremendously stupid things but I found The Sublime Object of Ideology to be pretty good. What's really accessible, and in fact down right funny, are his movies: Pervert's Guide to Cinema and Pervert's Guide to Ideology. They're a very fun jumping-off point.
