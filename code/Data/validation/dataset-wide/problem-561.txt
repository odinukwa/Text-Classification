There are no compatibility issue at all. For the most part, Campagnolo, SRAM and Shimano have designed their groupsets to work to common frame characteristics. Drillings for electronic might be an issue in that Campagnolo EPS has until recently and still in the case of Chorus) needed an extra drilling for the Power Unit charge port, but that is a hurdle that any competent fitting technician should be able to clear. Campagnolo make adapters for all of the current formats of BB with the exceptions of BB Rite in PowerTorque only (they do it in UltraTorque) and Specialized OSBB, neither of which is not a problem that applies here. Shimano use third party solutions - they don't offer any in-house compatibility with anything other tha BSC or Italian threded BBs. 

Given that all the manufacturers spend enormous amounts of time & money on R and D to make sure that all their parts are properly compatible and will behave exactly the way they want them to, it's crazy to mix and match. My company do work as a contractor for Campag but another part of my company also look after general mechanics training and so we are very familiar with Shimano, SRAM etc at all levels - and if you asked if a Campag chain could be used with Shimano I'd say the same as the other way about - yes, it'll work but it won't work as intended or even as well as the proper item - you will also be binning your warranty and if it all goes wrong and you end up in hospital, don't even bother trying to sue either manufacturer ... the same applies with KMC (here, KMC take up the liability, good luck with that if you ever need to call them to account) and SRAM - designed to work with SRAM of course ... This is all completely normal and to be expected. The days when you could mix and match with total impunity disappeared some while ago ... 

Daytona and Chorus use different cage fixings, so swapping a Daytona cage in in place of a Chorus 10s one is not possible. Daytona used a circlip, Chorus uses a tubular bolt to secure the cage to the lower pivot assembly of the rear derailleur (RD). Unless the RD has been crashed, or the cage has been "snagged" by the spokes of the rear wheel, it's unlikely that the cage is deformed. More likely is that the rubber o-rings that set the amount of float on the top pivot have softened with prolonged contact with mineral oil and the RD is no longer hanging dead square - this assumes that you have done a full & correct RD set-up. If you want to send us the RD for checking, we can do this ... HTH Graeme Campagnolo main UK Service Centre www.velotech-cycling.ltd.uk 

I'll declare an interest in that my company is the senior (Main) Technical, Service and Warranty Centre for Campagnolo in the UK - but having said that. the Service Centre work that we do for Campagnolo is not all of what we do - we supply general technical training to the industry across the board and I am also part owner and Technical Director of a business that looks after Services de Courses activity for races and spotifs here & in Europe (www.servicecorps.eu), so I have seen the best and the worst of all the electronic and mechanical systems out there. There are some urban myths around electronic - wet weather performance being one. This is not an issue for any of the systems in the market if they are properly installed. Shimano has slightly greater vulnerability because there are more breaks in the wiring loom than with Campagnolo but if it's assembled to Shimano specs this is not a problem. Battery life - Di2 and Campagnolo are both around the same - both will give from a full 4 hour charge, something around 1200 km of normal use - it depends how much you shift and how the split is between F and R shifting. F shifting is more power consumptive in both systems. If the battery fails, Shimano defaults to the inside chainring. Campagnolo allows you to manually position the RD under any lower (easier) gear than the one you were in when the battery failed but you can't manually move the FD. In our experience, most people with electronic shift are so paranoid about this that in real life it's never a problem. Electronic shift won't make you go any faster in and of itself ... it is more accurate though and once correctly installed, it will remain as accurate as it was the day it was installed, unless the user changes something, chain, cassette and chairing wear of course needing to be accounted for. The accuracy of shift remains, however tired the rider. In competition, this can matter. Cost and cost of ownership - Shimano Ultegra Di2 is at a killer initial price point - the system is robust, spare parts are widely available and expertise likewise. Problems though, can be a headache to diagnose and the diagnostic software also requires (at the moment, anyway) connection through a relatively expensive interface to a PC. Campagnolo Chorus is comparatively expensive but offers a higher-spec, carbon crank set and on-board basic diagnostics. In my general (and genuine) experience, chainring and cassette life is better than Shimano, chain life can be better and I have never seen a correctly fitted Campagnolo chain fail - I have seen one or two instances with Shimano chain that I can't account for by fitting (but maintenance and use play into this and there is also a lot more Shimano "around" so that might also account for it on simple probability rules. If the cost and availability issues are not the decision makers, then in terms of functionality, there is very little to choose - both shift, shift relaibly and well. Some users prefer the ergonomics of one over the other, especially when wearing gloves - Campagnolo use a thumb lever to shift one way, a lever behind the brake lever to shift the other way so you are never in doubt which way you are going to shift - that's not always the case with Shimano with their closely-located shift buttons. Campagnolo place the feet closer together on all their crank designs than Shimano - this gives more options for bike fitting (if that is a consideration) and could be said to be inherently more "aero" FWIW. Most of the choice, costs aside, are going to come down to aesthetics and ergonomics. There is very little bad product from Shimano or Campagnolo in the market now, design and execution from both makers is excellent. IME if SRAM could sort out some of their build-quality issues, they'd be up there as well but conversation with bike mechanics will tell you where their preferences lie and it's not as often with SRAM as with Shimano or Campagnolo - having said that a lot of mechanics are more wary of Campagnolo because they don't see it so often and equate doing things differently, with doing things worse. Not the case - but you do have to know how to set it up & that's not the same was as Shimano. 

The Centaur 10s crank will give you the closest-to-original performance but the problem areas are all around the width and overall design of the chain. Whilst the post fromFred above is true insofar as it states that the external dimension of the chain is different, it neglects to say that because of that width difference, in addition to a difference in chain construction, the way that the front derailleur and the chain interact is different. Occasionally the chain will "ride" or "float" when going from a big chainring to a smaller one, without cleanly engaging the teeth of the chainring. Going "up", there is a problem in that the ramps on the chainrings are designed to engage the outer cage plate of the chain to help it "lift" - the 9s chain does not have flush rivets, they protrude slightly, so the upshift ramps don't work anything like as well - you can mitigate this by also changing the chain to a 10s Ultra Narrow chain and adjusting the FD with great care. It is not a combination that we would advise, however. As the main Campagnolo factory-appointed Warranty and Service Centre for the UK, we can assure you that the above answer is correct. 

Might be a spec change by Shimano - I know that there is no change to the Campag chain. As they are not designed to be compatible, if Shimano have changed something they will have done so only referencing their own 9s HG type chain which is slightly narrower than Campagnolo's. The other things to look at are a stiif link or a chain rivet protruding slightly at the join. If it's once per crank rev (rather than once per full chain rev) it would be more likely to be related to the rings - if you are doing 11000km per chain / cassette I'd guess the rings might be getting pretty tired unless you are changing once every couple of chains - depends whose rings, riding conditions etc ... 

RD-AT115 has a screw thread pitch of 0.8 mm, the standard size for a 5mm metric thread. The later RD-DA004 and related rear adjusters, including RD-SR014 all have a thread pitch of 0.5 mm, standard size for "M5 fine". The older, typically 8 and 9s RDs did not need such a fine adjustment to cable tension, simply because the precision required of the system as a whole was not as high and the rear derailleur return spring has, over the years, been gradually reduced in strength - in fact there are two slightly different strengths in use according to the derailleur model and year, and have been since 2002. This has meant that the pitch of the screw and so the amount of variation in tension per full turn that the screw induces, has needed to be changed. There are also materials differences that affect the overall price of the derailleur but not the function - so some adjusters are made of a simple Magnesium Zinc Aluminium alloy, others are made in polished stainless steel. 

Yes, this missing plastic piece is the culprit. It does need to be there. If the derailleur is within 3 years of purchase, is in use with a full Campagnolo drive train (chain, cassette, crankset and chainrings, no 3rd party joining link in the chain) and you have a valid proof of purchase, then it is possibly a valid warranty claim - the warranty can be operated by any bicycle shop, who will need to forward the part to a Service Centre where the problem will be assessed and if appropraite, the warranty operated. As the main Campagnolo factory-appointed Warranty and Service Centre for the UK, we can assure you that the above answer is correct. 

You will need a pre-2000 rear derailleur as the cable pull ratio was changed in MY2001 and the lever / rear derailleur movement artio, if you use a current 9/10s RD will not give you accurate indexing. You can use and front derailleur from Campagnolo describing itself as "9/10s" compatible but you may find that you need to set it up with more care as the most recent 9/10s FDs have a different movement to cable recovery ratio, too - this is not such a big problem on the FD as it is on the rear, because you are not aiming for such exact index points but it can still be a consideration. As the main Campagnolo factory-appointed Warranty and Service Centre for the UK, we can assure you that the above answer is correct. 

How old is your Veloce system? This may (as previously commented) be a spring issue in a pre-2007 system. After that, it's a whole-shifter-body issue, except for Veloce UltraShift, available only in 2009 - these shifter units are serviceable, although you do need the parst which are now almost impossible to find (we have them here at the main UK Campagnolo Service Centre). 

No. it won't shift correctly - SRAM must be used with appropriate SRAM levers, Shimano with compatible Shimano levers, Campagnolo with compatible Campagnolo levers. Each manufacturer has their own ratio for cable recovery to derailleur movement, each company has their own strategy for coping with the fact that the angular movement of the chain sprocket-to-sprocket across the range of the cassette has to vary slightly. Shimano and SRAM manage the latter mostly in the lever, Campagnolo split the management across the lever and the cassette spacing, which contrary to most internet chatter is not the same as Shimano / SRAM and nor is it constant.
