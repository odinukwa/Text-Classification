It's also safe in the sense that nothing is going to blow up while writing - it's all on paper. It's an exploration of what could be that examines the consequences, before it's built. So much for the term safe; now for laboratory. Laboratories are places where experiments are done, tests are made, theories are explored. Likewise, a science-fiction novel is a laboratory for the future. What if this is true? How does that affect the plot? Look at some of the questions on Worldbuilding.SE and you will see that the world that is constructed imposes restrictions on things that can be done in that world, and it affects how the people in that world operate. And finally, the term that is I think the strangest in that quote, sterile. The fourth definition of sterile as per Webster is 

You can make an argument for anything, really. It just depends on whether it's a good argument. I'd argue that the common interpretation of Fahrenheit 451 as being about government censorship isn't a very good interpretation. What fits much better is the one that the author himself intended: 

Even if Singer's work wasn't very well known, the popularity of the author's work isn't a requirement for being picked. What the committee says Finally, I might point out that the Nobel committee itself issues a statement explaining its reasoning: 

If, as Will Crawford says, instead of ramifications, it actually says machinations, the phrase makes even more sense. Machinations are schemes/plots. In other words, it's saying that Ella's not-so-savory (evil/non-legal) plans to gain power and money by marrying Cody were common knowledge to journalists. 

Was he familiar with Twain? While I really couldn't find much on this topic, here is what I found. As a comment mentioned, 

This is the purpose of the firemen: to continue what humans on their own began. Without the firemen, one could argue, the situation would be mostly the same - a few eccentrics, but the majority focused only on violence and quick entertainment. And that's exactly the statement which Bradbury wanted to make: today, we are going down that path. When I go down my school hallway I see more phone screens than mouths talking. I'm considered an extreme nerd (and so are most of my friends for that matter) for ::gasp:: liking to read and learn. School has moved away from learning and towards making school "interesting" and incorporating "technology". This point about school is also made in Fahrenheit 451: 

The phrase "that most limited of all specialists" refers to "the well-rounded man" in this sentence. When we refer to a "well-rounded" person, we refer to someone who generally knows a little about a lot of things, and is able to appreciate a lot of things. They're the sort of person that knows who painted the Mona Lisa and perhaps The Ambassadors (if you're wondering on the latter, it's Hans Holbein the Younger), has read Romeo and Juliet and perhaps The Catcher in the Rye, knows what particles make up an atom, and so forth. In other words, they can catch basic allusions and references made by others. (This is a bit of an exaggeration to make a point, but ah, well.) They specialize in knowing a little bit about everything. On the other hand, another specialist (think a savant, here) might make a point to know everything there is to know about Beowulf but have no clue that Julius Caesar is really more about Brutus, and yet another might be a stellar particle physicist but not know a femur from a tibula. So why is the first type of specialist, the well-rounded one, more useless? A savant-type specialist knows everything (or darned well near it) there is to know about a particular topic. When a problem comes up, they are almost assuredly able to solve it, or at least get the ball rolling. But the well-rounded specialist? They have no idea how to do anything of any depth in any field, because they've only skimmed the surface in a lot of fields, instead of going very in depth in one. It's a bit of a rephrasing of the expression, "Jack of all trades, useful at none" (or something like that, anyway). As for the second part of your question, the author is, I believe, referring to the fact that it's easier to be able to see only one perspective on an issue as opposed to being able to see multiple views on an issue. 

If you think about what a mushroom cloud would look like from the inside in that very instant before it incinerates you, it would look like a halo - one would merely see the ring, not the whole "poof". 

The point here is more along the lines that as fallible humans, we cannot really know what is truly right - "All [...] not understood" meaning we don't have the full knowledge of the situation. His last two lines here sum up his point: "And spite of Pride" (though we make think we are wiser and would like to believe otherwise) "in erring Reason's spite" (in spite of the fact many philosophers and moralists believe they have found out their morals using sound, unbreakable logic) "One truth is clear" (amidst all the things we think might be right but aren't sure) "Whatever IS, is RIGHT". Thus, I'm not completely sure that Pope was quoted exactly as he would've liked to be, but the point still stands, I believe. 

I've been reading a lot of Vonnegut recently, and I've noticed some interesting stuff. Slaughterhouse-Five or the Children's Crusade, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater, and Cat's Cradle are similar to a novel in format, though Slaughterhouse Five is of course all "out of order" and in two of the three, Vonnegut breaks the fourth wall more than a few times. On the other hand, Timequake is this weird combination of stream of consciousness, real life, and fiction, so you have no idea what the heck's going on. Semi-similarly, Wampeters, Foma, and Granfalloons (a collection of Vonnegut's talks and articles) go over all sorts of different topics, with little rhyme or reason (at least to my mind), feeling kind of stream of conscious-y as well. Interestingly, looking at the dates the novels were published, it shakes out as follows: 

(This is from the speech of Mordred at the beginning; he is encouraging Arthur to go off to war against the east so he can begin his treachery to gain the throne, as far as I can tell.) Is it a correct interpretation to say that the "Eastern wolf" are the "heathen kings" to the east? I'm not sure if there's more to this reference than that...was Fenris wolf, for example, chained to the east? Does this allude to anything else? 

So by including the line, Eliot is referring to people's vices, one of which is criticizing others, being hypocritical. Thus, the interpretation still fits. 

So in this case: a laboratory barren of previous ideas, so it is therefore open to the creation of new ones. If you want to explore the absence of government, you can write about it while ignoring previous stances on the subject. You can introduce out there things like warp drives. It allows you to be more open to new ideas by taking them away from the backdrop of the old ones. As the book The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human (google books link) says: 

I think there were several factors here, though of course we don't know all of them. Not really niche Firstly, I'd like to address the point of audience. While you say 

In Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur it's very heavily implied that Merlin enchanted the stone and the sword in it so it only could be pulled out by the true king of Britain/Arthur: 

Ideas can be frightening, and can hurt those who produce them. See for an example the ideas of Galileo, and where they got him - house imprisonment, banned from discussing the heliocentric view. Science fiction, on the other hand, can be frightening, but it is contained. It is fiction. Yet still, like all literature, it contains an idea - it conveys the author's point, but more subtly than outright stating it. 

The second paragraph proposes the exact opposite, by arguing that there is no standard moral model. That is, it argues that there is no "correct" system of moral beliefs, and that whatever someone considers right or wrong, is right or wrong - thus the Alexander Pope quote, "Whatever is, is right". In this case it reformulates the purpose of the novel into 

Well, the rabbit is described as our universe, pulled out of a magician's hat, where the magician is God. Philosophers, discoverers, they are the ones Sophie says built the Tower of Babel, or climbed to the tip of the rabbit's hairs. She thus represents the Tower of Babel as a great achievement. Sophie then represents God, or the magician, as wishing to not reveal the trick, limiting the philosophers and humans. The meaning of this could be taken in several ways. First, God can be seen as a harsh God from this picture - one who limits the explorers, the most creative, wishing humans to live a passive life, accepting their world as it is. Second, God can be seen as a God who wishes to preserve the questions, and wait to reveal them at a later time - that is, He is not ready to reveal the answers, so He stops the humans from climbing out to watch. Third, God can be seen as protective - perhaps humans are not ready, or never will be ready, to see the answers to their deep questions, and so He is protecting them from their own wish. There could of course be other viewpoints I have not thought of, but these are the three big ones that immediately appear to my mind. These viewpoints range from "good" to "bad" - the third viewpoint representing a "good" God, the second not as obviously benevolent, though He could be; we don't know, and the first "bad". The question is which Sophie takes to be the case. Originally, I thought the first interpretation was most likely, but after more thought, I am leaning towards the second interpretation. The reason is the amount Sophie swings around between different viewpoints on God. At first she questions the existence of God (how could God have come to be?) and then later feels "at one" with God/the universe. Her perspective on God varies as much as that of the philosophers. The second viewpoint seems neither good nor bad from our limited perspective, which makes me think it's the viewpoint she'd take. 

To explain #2 a little more - David was incredibly ashamed after he committed adultery with Bathsheba. In Psalm 51, listed in the NIV as "A psalm of David. When the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba" David says 

(Nazg means [finger]-ring or [magic]-ring.) If it did come from Black Speech, as likely, that would indicate a very low probability that that is association with your 'azoch'/'azoth'. Adunaic, on the other hand, is more interesting. Adunaic was the speech of the Numenoreans, which derived to some extent from the Elvish languages (as the Numenoreans were those who were gifted by the Elves, so they were very aware of Elvish languages) though with some distinctions. For example, it has some of the characteristics of Khuzdul (the language of the dwarves), and also has noun classes. Westron then derived from Adunaic. The language of the Rohirrim is an archaic relative of Westron similar to Old English, therefore by taking this route it is not completely unlikely that 'Azog' may have had its origins in 'azoch'/'azoth', but for in-universe reasons I am disinclined to believe this the case (as stated above). There is yet a third possible route. The black speech (probably) was based upon, as said earlier, hittite and hurrian, and a not insignificant selection of orcish dialects were probably based upon this as the orcs were created (or rather perverted) by Morgoth, and Sauron was his lieutenant (see Silmarillion) but there were some orcish dialects that were based upon Westron, according to Robert Foster's Guide to Middle-Earth under 'Westron', though it should be noted that this book was published before the History of Middle Earth series and its associated information came out. If the orcs Azog was among used such a Westron-based language, I would still, however, have some doubt in my mind as to whether this was an association Tolkien would make. It then gets more confusing when one comes to the 'Orc' section in the same book. Here it says that the more Westron based orcish dialects were used for communication between tribes, whereas more black-speech based dialects which varied dramatically from tribe to tribe were used within tribes. If this is the case then the personal name of Azog probably still came from this black-speech based dialect; under 'Black Speech' it says that many Mordor orcs, indeed, had their names in a "debased" form of black speech; then again, Azog wasn't necessarily a Mordor-orc, though he could have been. An important note It should also be noted that Westron is represented as English in the book, but the whole book is represented as translated, so the names that we're referencing weren't the actual names, but the translated names, which I'll admit gets kind of confusing. For more information on this bit, see the font of all knowledge, Wikipedia or Appendix F of the Lord of the Rings. To summarize the situation as best I can: since Westron was the most commonly spoken language in Middle Earth, Tolkien treated that language as English and then worked from there so that languages closely related to Westron, like the language of the Rohirrim, were treated accordingly. Thus the language of the Rohirrim comes out much like Old English. In other words, Tolkien as the translator represented this world as if it was ours and the legends in our tongues (sort of; his own versions of our tongues with a few others added in). General resources I would check the conlang stack exchange which allows questions on Tolkien's languages. I'd also take a look at this website (one of the most detailed and well-sourced descriptions I've found of Tolkien's various languages). Finally, check out the History of Middle Earth, especially, in the case of this question, volume 12, The Peoples of Middle Earth, which, to quote the above site, 

Interestingly enough, this is not the only time a tree appears in Tuwhare's poetry. In Friend, he writes for the last stanza 

Which I think also points towards critics. "Hypocrite reader" - it's a common phrase that "those who can't do, critique" - and so critics can be seen as hypocrites, who examine something and point out all the flaws, when they themselves have many flaws and haven't created something nearly as good. As for "my similar" - most of us by nature critique - it's normal to notice the flaws before the perfections. So the passage is saying, keep the critics far away - else they'll dig up what's left of the person and their memories and doings and destroy the things that are growing from their work.
