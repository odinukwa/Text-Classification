Common to them all above are that they are various reasons for ignoring exactly certain specified information. Not more, not less. Now, all of the above reasons apply to why you may what to study E-localization of a space. Examples are given in previous answers. We have arithmetic squares for various E, some people prefer to work with E only, so why not localize? And, obviously, any physically meaningful quantity of a (7,10)-extended QDW-theory on 2-brains, is an E-invariant, right? ;) Localizing is obviously different from studying just the E-homology of the space, even if you try to be fancy by upgrading the values to, say, to E-module spectra or one of the zillion other natural choices. These other constructions do not forget exactly what you choose to ignore. Localization does. There is of course the interesting subsequent question of relating say the E-completion (constructed as the Tot of an explicit tower, and often more computable) to E-localization (which has the good abstract properties). But that is a separate story... By the way, Bill Dwyer wrote a beautiful survey paper "Localizations" a few years ago, with lots of examples $URL$ 

I'm not sure exactly what you are after, but here is an elementary discussion, surely well known to you. Rephrasing what Mark Hovey said, the first question you should ask yourself is probably why localize at all? There may be several reasons. Here are some: 

Yes: As has been pointed out, admitting the structure of a connected $A_\infty$-space is the same thing as being homotopy equivalent to a connected loop space. The Hilton-Roitberg criminal, mentioned by Vladimir Dotsenko, was the first example of a closed manifold homotopy equivalent to a loop space, but not to a Lie group. The space has the rational homotopy type of the compact Lie group Sp(2). In fact there exists "rational criminals", i.e., finite loop spaces that are homotopy equivalent to closed smooth manifolds (as always, by the Broto-Kitchloo-Notbohm-Pedersen theorem), but not even rationally homotopy equivalent to a Lie group. However, they only start occurring in rank 66 and onwards. See this paper that I wrote with Andersen-Bauer-Pedersen 

I feel a bit funny posting this as an answer to someone who has written a book with "finite groups of Lie type" in the title. But I also find the matter both confusing and interesting (and full of conflicting terminology!), so here's my outside take on this, being a topologist of training: (My own literature references include the standard sources: Carter, Gorenstein-Lyons-Solomon3..., as well as the recent (recommendable!) book by Malle-Testerman): I thought the most general definition of a finite group of Lie type was close to your definition $\cal L_1$: Definition ($\cal L_3$): A finite group of Lie type $G$ is a finite group obtained as ${\mathbf G}^F$, where $\mathbf G$ is a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$, and $F$ is a Steinberg endomorphism (aka "twisted Frobenius", a composite of a Frobenius map and an automorphism of $\mathbf G$), or a group obtained from such a group ${\mathbf G}^F$ by modding out by a central subgroup, or passing to a normal subgroup with abelian quotient group. Groups of this form will have many "Lie-like" properties, and in particular admit a canonical BN-pair structure. (Admitting a BN-pair structure would be another possible definition!) Some authors restrict $\cal L_3$ by assuming $\mathbf G$ is semi-simple, or even simple, and some authors don't allow central quotients or passing to subgroups contained in the commutator subgroup. (One reason to allow the central quotients and subgroups is that otherwise the construction rarely produces simple groups: $|{\mathbf G}^F|$ only depends on the isogeny class of $\mathbf G$, e.g., adjoint and simply connected form have the same order, so ${\mathbf G}^F$ itself will never be simple unless $\mathbf G$ has associated Cartan matrix of determinant $1$.) Sticking with reductive (rather than simple or semi-simple) has the advantage that Levi subgroups in finite groups of Lie type are still finite groups of Lie type, which is useful if you're doing induction. If you (for some reason) want to avoid tori $\mathbb F_q^{\times}$ and twisted products of non-trivial groups in this definition, but keep $GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$, you can maybe add the assumption to $\mathcal L_3$ that the root datum associated to $\mathbf G$ is indecomposable, and the associated root system not a product of two non-trivial root systems, or something like that? To an outsider this seems artificial? However, not all classical groups will be in $\mathcal L_3$, e.g., $SO_{2n}^+(\mathbb F_q)$ (with the standard (classical!) definition). The problem arises from that its not connected as an algebraic group when $q$ is a power of two, so one has to pass to an index 2 subgroup, the kernel of the "pseudo/quasi-determinant", instead of the old-fashioned determinant. In particular the Weyl group of $E_8$, which is a central extension $2\cdot SO_8^+(8)$, is also not in $\mathcal L_3$, as Derek alluded to. ($W_{E_8}$ is "even further" freakish than $SO_8^+(2)$ since the central extension is related to that the index two subgroup $Spin^+_8(2)$ has non-generic Schur multiplier $\mathbb Z/2 \times \mathbb Z/2$, not zero as usual.) I would (perhaps naively) argue that these groups also should not be considered finite groups of Lie type since they (unless I'm mistaken) do not admit the structure of a BN-pair; the structure of their p-radical subgroups is more chaotic (the Borel-Tits theorem fails). Interpreting your $\mathcal L_2$ to consist of groups $G$ which has a filtration by normal subgroups $1< Z < H < G$, where Z is central in $G$, $G/H$ is abelian, and $H/Z$ is a simple non-abelian subquotient of a group in $\mathcal L_3$ (or equivalently $\mathcal L_1$), we will have $\mathcal L_3 \subseteq \mathcal L_2$. With these interpretations, we can give the following response to your question: 

If you are willing to make "niceness" assumptions, assuming that the n-type is, say, nilpotent with finite fundamental group, then the dimension, in any reasonable sense, will always be infinite, since it will have homology in infinitely many dimensions. The first result along these lines is due to Serre: J.-P. Serre, Cohomologie modulo 2 des complexes d’Eilenberg–Mac Lane, Comment. Math. Helv. 27 (1953), 198–232. I wrote a couple of papers about this back in the days: $URL$ $URL$ where I prove that the cohomology, also as a ring, will be huge. If you don't want to make assumptions on the fundamental group, then it is an open problem. There are no known examples of n-types that are not $K(G,1)$s but that are homotopy equivalent to finite dimensional CW-complexes. And that there are no such examples has been stated as a conjecture by Casacuberta-Castellet in "Mislin's book of conjectures": $URL$ 

The space $BG/G$, with the model you describe, has been studied, but is not completely understood. It's $\pi_1$ identifies with the abelianization, but there may be higher homotopy. It identifies with a hocolim over the Quillen category with objects all subgroups and morphisms given with conjugation and inclusion. I'm not sure the group $K$ will have a very meaningful description (but I hope I'm wrong). The question you ask actually came up earlier on the Don Davis algtop list, see $URL$ and look under "Question about G and BG", and the responses. To my regret I can't find the notes by Bill Dwyer referred to here, though they have been in my possession. 

Yes, for any connected X we can find a $\pi$ such that $H^*(X;k) \cong Ext_{{k}\pi}(k,k)$ This is the Kan-Thurston theorem: Kan, D. M.; Thurston, W. P. Every connected space has the homology of a K(π,1). Topology 15 (1976), no. 3, 253–258. combined with the universal coefficient theorem and the isomorphism $H^*(K(\pi,1);k) \cong Ext^*_{k\pi}(k,k)$ 

As stated in previous answers, the answer to the question is no. Here is another viewpoint, which gives additional information about the relationship between $G$ and $BG$: A pair $(G,BG)$ where $G$ is a topological group homotopy equivalent to a finite CW complex, and $BG$ its classifying space, is called a finite loop space in the literature. So the question is if a finite loop space $G$ can have classifying space $BG$ homotopy equivalent to a finite CW complex, and the answer to this is no. As pointed out in the previous answers, to get that $BG$ does not have a finite dimensional model, it is easy to reduce to the case where $G$ is connected (using that $BG$ is not finite for $G$ a finite group), so let's assume this. Now, by the structure of Hopf algebras (Milnor-Moore) $H^*(G;{\mathbb Q})$ is an exterior algebra on a number $r$ of odd dimensional generators. The number $r$ is called the (rational) rank, and agrees with the usual notion of rank of compact Lie groups. Hence by a spectral sequence argument 

Proof of Fact: The claim e.g., follows from a more general statement saying the rank is also equal to the number of odd degree generators for the mod $p$ cohomology (see Kane: Homology of Hopf Spaces Section 13-3, which uses the Bockstein spectral sequence to deduce this). To get the more limited statement of the rank being positive one can give a more pedestrian argument: Suppose that $G$ is non-contractible. Then (since its a simple space and a CW complex) $\tilde H^*(G;{\mathbb Z}) \neq 0$. If this cohomology is torsion free, then the rational cohomology is non-trivial, and we are done. So suppose there is torsion. If there is non-trivial $p$-torsion in $\tilde H^*(G;{\mathbb Z})$ then, by the universal coefficient theorem, $H^*(G;{\mathbb F_p})$ has cohomology in two consecutive degrees. So $H^*(G;{\mathbb F_p})$ has to have generators as a ring in odd degrees. But then the structure of Hopf algebras algebras shows that the Euler characteristic of $G$ has to be zero (since $H^*(G;{\mathbb F_p})$ contains an exterior tensor summand on a odd degree class, if $p$ is odd, and a truncated polynomial algebra on an odd degree class, truncated at $x^{2^k}$ for some $k$, if $p=2$). But $\chi(G) =0$ implies $\tilde H^*(G;{\mathbb Q}) \neq 0$ as wanted. Additional info: There has been a lot of work on finite loop spaces, starting with the work of Hopf and Serre in the 1940's and 1950's, since they are generalizations of compact Lie groups. (Hopf looked at the weaker notion of H-spaces.) There is by now in fact a classification of (connected) finite loop spaces; see Section 3 of my survey paper $URL$ 

You have some a priori interest in only studying spaces up to a certain equivalence relation (physical, philosophical, application-based). E.g., you study spaces up to homotopy since many physical properties are preserved by continuous deformation.... You know some procedure for (more or less) reconstructing what you are really interested in from the localized pieces. E.g., you have arithmetic squares that (try to) piece localizations together. You are really interested in the unlocalized object, but all the tools at your disposal factors through the localization. So you might as well study the localized objects, to rid yourself of information that your methods will not say anything about anyhow. E.g., you want to compute the integral homotopy groups of spheres, but you consistently screw up your signs when looking at odd primary stuff, so you localize at 2. 

The Schur multiplier $H^2(G;{\mathbb C}^\times) \cong H^3(G;{\mathbb Z})$ of a finite group is a product of its $p$-primary parts $$H^3(G;{\mathbb Z}) = \oplus_{ p | |G|} H^3(G;{\mathbb Z}_{(p)})$$ as is seen using the transfer. The $p$-primary part $H^3(G;{\mathbb Z}_{(p)})$ depends only of the $p$-local structure in $G$ i.e., the Sylow $p$-subgroup $S$ and information about how the subgroups of $S$ become conjugate or "fused" in $G$. (This data is also called the $p$-fusion system of $G$.) More precisely, the Cartan-Eilenberg stable elements formula says that $$H^3(G;{\mathbb Z}_{(p)}) = \{ x \in H^3(S;{\mathbb Z}_{(p)})^{N_G(S)/C_G(S)} |res^S_V(x) \in H^3(V;{\mathbb Z}_{(p)})^{N_G(V)/C_G(V)}, V < S\}$$ One in fact only needs to check restriction to certain V above. E.g., if S is abelian the formula can be simplified to $H^3(G;{\mathbb Z}_{(p)}) = H^3(S;{\mathbb Z}_{(p)})^{N_G(S)/C_G(S)}$ by an old theorem of Swan. (The superscript means taking invariants.) See e.g. section 10 of my paper linked HERE for some references. Note that the fact that one only need primes p where G has non-cyclic Sylow $p$-subgroup follows from this formula, since $H^3(C_n;{\mathbb Z}_{(p)}) = 0$. However, as Geoff Robinson remarks, the group $H^3(S;{\mathbb Z}_{(p)})$ can itself get fairly large as the $p$-rank of $S$ grows. However, $p$-fusion tends to save the day. The heuristics is: Simple groups have, by virtue of simplicity, complicated $p$-fusion, which by the above formula tends to make $H^3(G;{\mathbb Z}_{(p)})$ small. i.e., it becomes harder and harder to become invariant (or "stable") in the stable elements formula the more $p$-fusion there is. E.g., consider $M_{22} < M_{23}$ of index 23: $M_{22}$ has Schur multiplier of order 12 (one of the large ones!). However, the additional 2- and 3-fusion in $M_{23}$ makes its Schur multiplier trivial. Likewise $A_6$ has Schur multiplier of order 6, as Geoff alluded to, but the extra 3-fusion in $S_6$ cuts it down to order 2. OK, as Geoff and others remarked, it is probably going to be hard to get sharp estimates without the classification of finite simple groups. But $p$-fusion may give an idea why its not so crazy to expect that they are "fairly small" compared to what one would expect from just looking at $|G|$...
