$Pr\left[ \frac{H(n, N, M)}{n} \geq \frac{M}{N} + t\right] \geq f(n, N, M, t)$ $Pr\left[ \frac{H(n, N, M)}{n} \leq \frac{M}{N} - t\right] \geq f(n, N, M, t)$ For all $\epsilon$ there are $k$ and $t^*$ such that $$ \frac{1}{2} - \epsilon < f(kn, kN, kM, t^*) $$ 

I have three three questions, the first two of which probably have the same answer and the third of which is more vague. For a set $A$ let $L_\alpha(A)$ be the constructible universe up to $\alpha$, built from $A$ as a set (and not a predicate). Further let $X = (B, f)$ where $B$ is a transitive set and $f$ is a bijection from $\omega$ to $B$. Also assume that the background universe has whatever large cardinals you would like (or that would be helpful). In particular though there is at least one inaccessible cardinal in $L$. (1) Suppose $L_\alpha\models ZFC$. Is it the case that $\omega_1^L = \omega_1^{L_\alpha}$? (2) Suppose $L_\alpha(X)\models ZFC$. Is it the case that $\omega_1^{L(X)} = \omega_1^{L_\alpha(X)}$? (3) If the answer to (1), (2) is yes, is there any simpler way for $L_\alpha$ to know that $\omega_1^{L_\alpha} = \omega_1^L$ (other than $L_\alpha\models ZFC$)? Finally I will just make one observation to highlight why this question isn't trivial. If you replace $ZFC$ with $KP$ then there are many countable admissible sets $L_\alpha\models KP$ with countable (in $L$) ordinals $\beta\in L_\alpha$ such that $L_\alpha \models \omega_1 = \beta$.

I am not sure if it counts as "set theoretic" forcing, but Makkai's the model existence theorem, which is a uniform treatment of Henkin constructions for $L_{\omega_1, \omega}$ can be viewed as a modification of Robinson's model theoretic forcing. For a good reference see Hodges book "Building Models by Games" 

This isn't a direct answer, but rather consists of two references (in the same book) which when you put them together provides a proof that all elementary categories are sketchable. The book is "Locally Presentably Categories and Accessible Categories" by Adamek and Rosicky. The first reference, Theorem 5.42 and Theorem 5.44. These theorems together show that a category is accessible if and only if it is equivalent to a cateory whose objects are models of some theory $T \subseteq L_{\kappa,\kappa}$ and whose morphisms consist of all embeeddings which preserve all formulas of $L_{\kappa, \kappa}$. In particular this implies that for any first order theory $T$ the category whose objects are of models of $T$ and whose morphisms are elementary embeddings is accessible. The second reference is Chapter 2F, and in particular Theorem 2.58 and Theorem 2.60 where they show a category is accessible if and only if it is sketchable. 

Computable Equivalence Relations Underlying set: Natural Numbers Notion of Computable Function: Computable function. This is the analog of Borel reducibility for the natural numbers. This is relatively new to be studied. References: 

Let $X$ be a transitive set containing $T$ along with $(C, J)$ and with $|X| = |T| + |(C, J)|$. Let $V^*$ be a transitive elementary substructure of the universe $V$ containing $X$ with $|V^*| = |X|$. As $V^*$ is an elementary substructure of $V$ and $V$ thinks there is a model $M$ of $T$ in $Sh(C, J)$ we also have $V^*$ thinks there is a model of $T$ in $Sh(C, J)^{V^*}$. Because the satisfaction relation is absolute $M$ should also model $T$ in $Sh(C, J)^V \cong G$. But $M$ should have presentability rank no more than $|V^*| = |T| + |(C, J)|$. 

While I won't be able to give full answers to the questions, I would like to point to a few ideas which I believe are relevant. I first would like to respond to your question: ``How big is the class of theories that have models in any Grothendieck topos?''. It was a little unclear whether you intended the question to only be about first order theories or not so I will consider the full case of (set sized) theories of $L_{\infty, \omega}$. First note that if a theory It is worth pointing out that given any geometric theory $T$ which has model in any Grothendieck topos must also have models in SET. Therefore any such $T$ must be classically consistent. However, if $T$ is any classically consistent theory (not just geometric) we can find an equivalent geometric theory by Morleyization. As such if there is some Grothendieck topos $G$ in which $T$ has no models then either: 

Knaster-Tarski's fixed point theorem: If $L$ is a complete lattice and $f:L \rightarrow L$ is order preserving, then the set of fixed points of $f$ form a (non-empty) complete lattice. 

Suppose V is a model of Godel-Berney's set theory with the axiom of choice. A well-known result of Kunen says that there can be no elementary embedding $V$ to itself. This result further implies that there can be embedding from $V$ to $V$ which is $\Sigma_1$-elementary. Is it consistent (with say Godel-Berney's set theory with the axiom of choice) that there is a $\Delta_1$-elementary embedding from $V$ to $V$? How about a $\Delta_0$-elementary embedding? 

What is a good source for Silver's proof (or a more modern version) that Con($\exists \omega_1$-Erdos cardinal) implies Con(Chang's Conjecture)? Silver's original proof seems to have never been published and I didn't find a proof in the set theory books I looked at (i.e. Jech's "Set Theory: the 3rd Millennium Edition" and Kanamori's "Higher Infinite") 

For a sequence of real numbers $s = (s_i)_{i \in n}$ let $M_s$ be the collection of functions $f:[0,1] \to [0,1]$ such that $$(\forall i \leq n) \int_0^1 x^i f(x) dx = s_i$$ In other words, $M_s$ is the collection of density functions whose first $n$ moments are $(s_i)_{i \leq n}$. I am interested in how much information knowing the first $n$ moments tells us about the function. Specifically, if we have the first $n$ moments of a function $f$ and we wish to approximate $f$ by $g$ with the same first $n$ moments, how badly could we be wrong? To make this precise, for $p \in \{1, 2, \infty\}$ let $\alpha_p$ be the function of $s$ $$\alpha_p(s) = \sup_{f, g \in M_s} ||f - g||_p$$ So $\alpha(s)$ is an upper bound for how far off we could be if we approximate a function with first $n$ moments $s$ by another function with the first $n$ moments $s$. Are there known lower bounds for the functions $n \to \sup_{|s| = n} \alpha_p(s)$ or $n \to \inf_{|s| = n} \alpha_p(s)$? I feel this must have been studied so references are also welcome. 

Note $\frac{H(n, N, M)}{n}$ is the fraction of balls from the sample which are white and $\frac{M}{N}$ is the expected value of $\frac{H(n, N, M)}{n}$. Let $T_t$ be the even that $$ \left|\frac{H(n, N, M)}{n} - Exp\left[\frac{H(n, N, M)}{n}\right]\right|\geq t. $$ Condition 3. can be thought of as saying, "if we imagine the balls are infinitely divisible, then $$ \lim_{t \to 0} \Pr(T_t) = 1, $$ i.e. as $t$ goes to $0$ the probability of a sample being at least $t$ away from the expected value goes to 1." 

I realize this is a slightly ill-defined question, however it seems probable that it has none the less been worked out and so I would appreciate any relevant references. 

It is well known that for any compact metric space $(X, d)$, and any ultrafilter $\mu$ there is a map $i_\mu:\prod_\mu (X, d) \to (X_d)$ in the category of metric spaces and Lipschitz maps where $i_\mu$ is an isomorphism in this category (and in particular an inverse to the constant map $\Delta: (X, d) \to \prod_\mu (X, d)$). It is also known that for any compact topological space $(X, O(X))$ and ultrafilter $\mu$ there is a map $i_\mu: \prod_\mu X \to X$ such that for all $U \in O(X)$: $$ (\forall (x_n) \in \prod_\mu X)\ i_\mu(x_n) \in U \leftrightarrow \{j : x_j \in U\} \in \mu. $$ Further the ultraproduct $\prod_\mu (X, O(X))$ in the category of (compact Hausdorff) topological spaces has $\prod_\mu X$ as its underlying set. My questions are: For which compact Hausdorff topological spaces is $i_\mu$ always continuous? For which compact Hausdorff topological spaces is $i_\mu$ always a homeomorphism? 

Suppose $V_0, V_1$ are (not necessarily well-founded) models of ZFC and suppose $\varphi$ is a first order sentence in a finite language $L$ (in our background model of set theory). Because every true finite set is an element of the well-founded part of both $V_0$ and $V_1$ we can consider $\varphi$ as an element of both $V_0$ and $V_1$. Is it the case that: $V_0 \models$ The deductive closure of $\varphi$ is a complete $L$-theory if and only if $V_1 \models$ The deductive closure of $\varphi$ is a complete $L$-theory? Thanks. 

Kleene's Second Recursion Theorem If $F$ is a total computable function then there is an index $e$ such that $\{e\} \simeq \{F(e)\}$. This has many applications such as effective transfinite recursion. 

Suppose $\circ:G \times X \to X$ with $X$ countable. There is a measure preserving dynamical system $([0,1]^X, \lambda^X, G)$ where $\lambda$ is the uniform measure on $[0,1]$ and for $(a_x)_{x \in X} \in [0,1]^X$, $g$ takes $(a_x)_{x \in X}$ to $(a_{\circ(g,x)})_{x \in X}$. If $X$ has a finite orbit $Y$ then there is an invariant measure preserving map from $([0,1]^X, \lambda^X)$ to $([0,1], \lambda)$. For example $$(a_x)_{x \in X} \mapsto \sum_{y \in Y} a_y \mod 1.$$ If $X$ has no finite orbits will there still always be an invariant measure preserving map from $([0,1]^X, \lambda^X)$ to $([0,1], \lambda)$? As a concrete example, is there such an invariant measure preserving map when $X = (\mathbb{Z}, S)$ and $G = $Aut$(\mathbb{Z}, S)$, where $S$ is the successor relation (and there is no other structure on $\mathbb{Z}$)? 

It is worth mentioning that in a strong sense half-graphs are the only thing which can cause irregular pairs. In the paper Regularity lemma for stable graphs by Malliaris and Shelah it is shown that when you bound the size of the half-graphs which can occur in your graph four remarkable things happen: (1) Irregular pairs are not needed. (2) The density of edges across regular pairs is very close to either 0 or 1, i.e. for any regular pair "almost surely" there is an edge connecting any two elements or "almost surely" there is no edge connecting two elements. (3) Every element of the partition is very close to either a complete graph or an independent set. (4) Then number of pieces needed to get an epsilon-regular partition is only approximately (1/epsilon)^k where k depends on the maximum size of the half graph which can exist.
