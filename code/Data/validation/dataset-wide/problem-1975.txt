This means your bradford factor is now 150. This falls into the typical threshold for "Consider Issuing a First Written Warning", so when you come back expect an even more serious response. 

I'm not sure what you mean by implied here - if they accused you of this, they are accusing you of misconduct, and this webpage may have more information for you. If they didn't say it outright and it is your interpretation then we need a little bit more information as to exactly what they said. 

It sounds like they are using the Bradford factor. The formula is S2 x D which for you with 4 absences and 5 days is 80. This is in the typical "Consider Issuing a Verbal Warning" threshold. I expect this is why they are harsher. 

As other answers have said, the national average includes long term sickness which massively drags the average up. I expect you're quite a long way above the average. 

My iPhone signature is automatically "Sent from my iPhone". My iPad does the same, and on my Android tablet, I get "Sent using Cloud Magic Email". Finally, on Desktop, it says "Sent Sent from Nylas N1" While I like all these apps / devices, and I'm happy to support them via a single line advertisement, I am not sure how professional it appears. I sometimes remove the signature but I'm never sure if I need to or not, and I normally leave it after a couple of email exchanges. Is there a sliding scale - is this fine for internal emails, but not advised externally, or should I just disable the signature for my work account? 

Yes - you've had a lot of absence, across many occasions, which is disruptive to your work and to the work of others. This can cost them a significant amount of money and time. In addition, they are following internal guidelines (the Bradford factor seems to be part of this). If they aren't consistent, they open themselves up to discrimination. If they are always relaxed about absence then someone will start to take advantage of this. 

Full-time in the UK is a poorly defined amount - a full time worker is normally considered to work more than 35 hours (which you do). The average full time worker is close to 37.2 hours per week, so their argument of you not working many hours is wrong. 

This calls for official process Either task management system (could be bit overkill), but it should be oficially known to everyone that: 

In my country is usual to have two types of wedding announcement: Wedding announcement I believe this is the best for you. It is simply official info about the wedding: 

I got recently contacted by a headhunter about new job. While I am totally happy at my current position, the job offer was so interesting, that I decided to apply for the job and see how do I stack up. However, the new company hiring process is 100% online and one of the steps requires to fill in my personal data, namely Skype account for later interview (should I pass tests which are automatic) As a tester by profession, I discovered bug on the page: My skype account is connected through my Microsoft account and therefore my Skype ID is my e-mail adress. However, the web form for inserting skype account has a validation which refuses sign to be entered into the field intended for skype. So, I told as a form of joke, that I definitly fulfill requirements for a good tester, because I am finding bugs even before being hired. I got back answer that I should describe this to the support of that website. I did describe the issue and got back answer, that this id going to be escalated to the DEV team of the site and I will be contacted back. Next working day I have been contacted by headhunter about what is the resolution, where I basically copypasted answer from the support. The day after, I got again contacted by this headhunter, asking me about if I got any resolution of this issue. (No). So I got asked to let the headhunter know if I receive any answer from the support until end of the day (Did not get any solution and told headhunter so). The last e-mail from headhunter literally reads: 

TL;DR: I am stuck in hiring process because of wrong validation of one of the automatic steps of hiring process for new tester. As already experienced tester I know that fixing bugs costs time. But recent communication with headhunter let me in belief that such issue should be fast fix. How much should I push the issue to know if its fixed? 

I'm currently sitting on the other side of the table, building up a team. Maybe it's not the norm but for me, if you 'talk the talk' as they say, I can get a feeling for whether candidates are good on the job and ultimately I'll form my picture working with a candidate on a trial day, or pair programming session. So, if you genuinely are good at a job, display it not by preening yourself on something but by having an honest conversation, being interested in what problems you would be facing and - if you can - Current producer supplier, on how you would approach those difficulties, regardless of whether you would be hired. Would work with me, at least. 

Step 3 demands your creativity. Think outside the box, don't go looking for "That One Job" that you want to do in the long run, but see how the things you like about that perspective can be fused with the job experience you already have. These jobs are out there and with an open mind, unblinkered, you will find it. And sooner than you expect. 

I don't consider interviews as tests that can be passed or failed, but at opportunities to gauge whether the interviewee would fit the position I'm seeking filled. If they went through the trouble of researching what I might ask and prepared the answers on a sheet of paper, I might actually consider that a good thing, because it could show their determination to learn what it takes to get the job, and, by extension, maybe also do it well. What bad might come from this: probably only wasted time on either side. You pass the interviewee on to somebody with domain knowledge to find out whether their skills are adequate for the open position and they might figure out the interviewee is not. But unless you know the domain of the interviewee, you can't do much more than follow a script of questions about it. So failing to see that their answers might be scripted (unless you heard them before, verbatim), shouldn't reflect badly on you. 

Applying for job is sort of like sales with yourself as the product, so you can apply this here. What does this mean? I'll take your example: 

Once you go through a recruiter you usually aren't allowed to contact the respective company directly. Conversely, recruiters won't follow through once they realize you're already in contact with the company, because it's costing the company extra money to pay the recruiter, which they won't pay because they already have a relationship with you. Also, taking up the offer of a recruiter is hardly keeping them from introducing more potential candidates, because it increases/activates they pool of candidates and because the more people they introduce the more likely it is that someone will fit the profile and they will get paid. Telling the company that you've also been contacted about this job by a recruiter may be helpful if you wrap it in a hint towards their stated policy of not working with recruiters. It shows that you pay attention to them and that others deem you a fit for the position, too. 

4. Watch body language: Most people tell you using body language that they "had it enough". Watch for crossed legs, crossed arms, overall look of being annoyed and voice change. If your friend becomes angry, stop immediately. My personal trick? 5. Drink water during giving feedback: If you feel your friend had it enough, drink from a glass. Slowly. It will: 

Also, my question is: What is the ratio? If you are only two people in team, then logically the ratio of answered e-mails should logically be 50:50 To me, it sounds like "one last drop" - your colleague might feel like he is answering all the e-mails, while you do nothing. So if someone tries to judge you for not answering low prio non urgent e-mail, their motive could be "I had it enough" So next steps: 

Again, assume misunderstanding, assume best intentions and act as willing to change, willing to take over, willing to step up (proactive, active, happy to do more work) 

Tell something good about a part which needs to improve Tell what needs to improve in that part Tell something nice (something else than in step 1) about the part which needs to improve 

2. Select main areas which need to be improved and stick to them No one wants to hear that their CV has 302 issues. Select two most important and stick to them 3. Use "sandwich" approach: 

Now. As a tester I know that fixing bugs can take some time and sometimes much more than just several working days (especially if it is generally minor issue like validation affecting just one user). But, previous conversation made me feel like that issue should be fixed soon and I will be able to continue the hiring process. While nothing is critical on my side about if I will be hired or not, it makes me now bit nervous in how should I proceed next. On one hand I do not want to look desperate in needing new job by pushing the headhunter about how to proceed next. On another hand I would like to know if a job posting several levels better (and thus several levels more demanding) is something I could fit for or not. During describing this issue, I offered the headhunter that I could create new Skype account to meet the form validations. But obviously, I would like to keep this option as very last one. How should I proceed next?
