Insects are sometimes viewed as currently dominant taxonomic group. They may have social behavior, hierarchies, bees can communicate each other the location and build relatively complex structures like honeycomb. These families may be superior to human families as they consist of big number of adult, fully capable individuals, not just of two adults and children who cannot do much. The only problem is the small size (so limited size of the brain), but say Hercules beetle may be 17 cm long so the brain need not be very small. Titan beetle is slightly shorter but has more massive body. The problem is probably that social insects are not as big as these beetles. Also, it may possible to have distributed brain built from brains of multiple individuals, using sound or electromagnetic waves to communicate. A bee brain contains about 950 000 neurons, human has about 100 billion. 105 000 bees would be required to have the same number of neural cells. That much can easily live in just two hives standing nearby (60 000 per hive) - fully realistic. It may be only a question of time before the nature hits that opportunity. 

So a 70 kg spider producing just 1 g of silk a day would need an additional caloric intake of 4500 Cal per day for silk production. Since real spiders eat enough to tide them over for days at a stretch: 

ETA: However, even with a thread 10 times thicker (10 microns => 100 microns) and 100 times heavier than normal spider silk, 1 g of spider silk would be more than 166 m (1.31 g/cc /(0.005 cm *0.005 cm *pi)), so it is highly unlikely that even a giant spider would be producing 1 g of silk a day. [Thanks to @Sempie for bringing my attention to this]. So more realistically, unless silk production is significant enough (in terms of width/density/length) to weigh a lot, it would have insignificant calorie cost. Additionally, Spiders often recycle their web silk. If these giant spiders are not expanding territory, they could be eating old silk to 'touch up' their webs, which could eliminate external (non-silk) caloric requirements even more. Hence: 

Let's take that number as "Caloric requirement at rest", since a captive Tarantula would have limited activity as compared to a 'wild spider' who would need to actively hunt for prey. For spiders, a significant source of metabolic cost is also silk-creation. [1]. So the more web/silk a giant spider produces, the more calories it will need. Spider silk is light - enough spider silk to go around the world once would only weigh 500 g, but let's say these giant spiders spin proportionally thicker silk, so that the same length of silk weighs a 100 times more. 

The species must be different enough to take the ecological niches so non overlapping that they would not compete significantly with each other. For instance, they must be adapted to the climate conditions so different, that area occupied by another species would not look more attractive than Antarctica for us. Species with similar niches do not co exist. One is always slightly stronger and pushes another out. This is true for all species, so should be true for thinking species as well. The only exception is if the environment has some stable variations, say humans would be stronger in summer and neanderthals in winter (probably was not the case). Geographical separation may work for some time, but as civilization evolves it soon takes over the whole planet even with rather primitive means of transportation. 

Yes, it is. A Hayflick limit. There is an actually existing "division counter" inside the body cells that can result the needed scenario. The cells of the animal (human) body can only divide limited number of times. This is because they are not capable of copying the whole genetic material: prolog and epilog of the "life book" in the DNA are not passed to the daughter cells. To work around this, start and end of the "book" just contains non-coding junk that does not carry the required information. However after the cell divides many times, this propagating damage reaches vital regions where real information resides, and the cell cannot longer divide, or the daughter cells die soon after division. Having such a "clock" would not prevent cells from being arbitrary active and smart, dividing and regenerating the body, even from very significant damage, as long as the "counter" is still above zero. The lost border sequences are only "regrown" at the start of the new organism and shortly afterwards. 

The paper linked above also gives an equation for activity cost of web building. Total Cost of Web Construction ~ (4.5 * Weight of Web in mg) + [Weight of Spider in grams * (2.79 * Weight of Web in mg)] calories I'm assuming this activity cost gets taken care of by Kleiber's Law, but if it doesn't, then the dietary requirements would be: => (4.5 * 1,000) + [70,000 * (2.79 * 1,000)] = 4500 + [70,000 * 2790] = a whopping and unsustainable 195,304,500 Calories! (An adult African elephant needs around 70,000 Cal per day for comparison) 

The reasoning behind this is that smaller an animal, larger the fraction of their body mass consisting of structure rather than reserve. Structural mass involves maintenance costs, while reserve mass does not; ergo small animals respire faster and need more calories per mass than larger ones. Assuming Kleiber's Law to hold true for these giant spiders, we can calculate their metabolic requirement by comparing it to a "real-life" spider of comparable activity levels, plus caloric requirement of silk production. A Goliath Bid-Eater, the largest tarantula species by mass, weighs around 70-80 g on average (though it can grow to be 170 g). According to spider-care websites[2], a diet of 6-8 crickets per week is sufficient for "the larger tarantula species". That's only about 10 Calories a week! By this calculation: 

A good, wise book can help you emotionally a lot - somebody wrote it and somebody printed. A good music or good painting, the same. These things are not alive by themselves. Emotions that they cause come from the humans who made them. A robot that talks great causing lots of positive emotions and can help, advise by telling the right thing in the right time would be a masterpiece of humans and engineers who have built it. This is ok. Same as the old sword from the famous past of the family, made by the famous master - also may provide emotional assistance without even being able to talk. Such "old trusted family robots" can be found in science fiction. The same knowledge, if ever acquired, will allow to develop a destructive robot as well (like capable of breaking personal relationship between two humans, or drive the depression till suicide). Still nothing new here, machines can cause pain or kill if designed to do, and lots of such have been built over history. 

There is no need to assume that water creatures cannot use processes or technologies that require air environment. Some manufacturing processes do require vacuum, or have required in the past (vacuum tubes, for instance). Humans live in the air but were capable of making vacuum when needed. And, for sure, they create water environment when needed (most of the chemistry). Aquatic creatures could make air environment, or even vacuum environment in they laboratories as required. For instance, diving bell may be possible to make from some shell or water plant, allowing to experiment with air technologies to discover lots of amazing things. In the Earth, spiders create air environment under water without any intelligence.
