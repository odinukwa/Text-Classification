As @Dukeling mentioned in his comment, if the recruiter asked you to send a text message, that is what you should do. There are a number of possible reasons that he might have suggested this: 

Specifically in response to your question about staying motivated: This answer is based upon my long-time thoughts about job interviews, but I think it can be expanded to the process of researching potential new employers as well. Try to approach thinking about job searching as furthering your knowledge about the field you work in. In every interview I have ever attended, the interviewer has asked me a question that made me think a little differently about what I am used to considering the standard responsibilities that go with my job description. Maybe they asked me about supervising other staff members, and I have never been in the role of supervisor before--well, now I know that at some firms my job title includes supervisory responsibilities, and it is important for me to begin thinking about how I will learn/develop this skill. They might ask you a question about how you would solve a problem that makes you realize that they use completely different processes than your current or previous employers. Now you have a new skill that you can begin learning about that will make you a stronger candidate for future opportunities. Questions like that can give you a tremendous insight into the way different companies function--and could potentially spark ideas for ways you might improve the processes you use at your current job. It's a little more difficult to tease this type of information out of a company website, but I still think that, as you review and research potential employers, you can try to think about how what you learn from their websites can enhance your understanding of your industry. Maybe they offer services that your current firm does not offer--think about how those services might be related to or combine in productive ways with the services you expected. Job hunting is never a fun process--but for me, using it as an opportunity to increase my knowledge and understanding of my chosen industry gives me an extra boost of energy that helps me move past those feelings of disappointment that occur when what I think is the perfect company for me doesn't even respond to my cover letter and resume. 

This is extremely minor. She has around 20 years on you and is at the "senior citizen"/elder level in society. 

This is somewhat major. I don't know anybody that likes being yelled at by their boss in front of everyone. It would seem this has been her style for a number of years, so I don't see a way you can change this. Just put it on your list of "cons" of the job. 

This is a question better asked on Security Stackexchange than here, but let me give it a shot. First, the safety of handing over this kind of information is highly contingent on how much you trust this recruiter. Is this a person you basically have exchanged emails or talked on a phone a few times? If so, this is similar to handing over this information to a person on the street. Can you be certain this supposed recruiter isn't going to use this information for identity theft? Or even if this recruiter isn't an identity thief, given the lack of concern this person seems to have about your privacy, can you be sure that this recruiter doesn't just leave this information in some online email account guarded with the password "password"? Note that while a passport number is not usually (at least in the US) used as part of identity verification except by certain governmental agencies, your passport does contain AFAIK the date of birth and possibly other identifying information that is used commonly on the Internet for identification purposes. It is not at all safe to give the last digits of your Social Security Number. It is used as part of identity verification for various government websites and even for some corporate websites, e.g. insurance, banking, or credit cards (see this site for more detailed info). This is no longer 1995. Most people are aware of identity theft and that SSNs are a security weakness. The recruiter is either ignorant or not very respectful of your privacy. Either way, I would not want to continue working with such a person. The thing that raises suspicion is that this should all be part of the background check later. If the recruiter is legit, then the recruiter doesn't really trust you (or his/her candidates in general). I would not want to continue a working relationship with a person that clearly distrusts me from the start. 

Well it sounds like he is not going to take a hint (I think ignoring several messages and blocking him on other sites should have been enough, but...), so I would be blunt. Write back to him and say "based on my previous experience working with you, I do not feel that I can provide a positive referral for you. Good luck in your job search". 

You can also set a timer and keep track of the time you are spending here. If you are on the site to search for information, and then you find yourself getting "caught" by the site after you have found the information you are looking for, set a timer for 10 minutes (on your phone or computer), and when the timer goes off, leave the site. If you are in the middle of an answer, copy the text you have written so far into a word processing document and save it there. That way the next time you have time to spend on the site, you can paste it back into an answer field and keep going. 

I can simply accept said situation and ignore that. Don't believe it is the best for the project I should try to help in a more well meaning, subtle way 

It is becoming clear that while he wants to learn, he is doing some harm to the project. It is not being noticed, nor do I want to make it go noticed: I respect the person and want to find a constructive solution. I also recognize that this all comes down to authority in the end. I do have a boss I should mention, who is keen to keep everything flat and equal. I have already expressed that while I believe in dynamism and equality, there comes a time one should take some lead in specific aspects. I have suggested for equality that the boss should give a lead to each of the member in it own best competence. For now the boss has refused, fearing some reactions. My question: is it ok to want to mentor, and if yes, is the way I tackle that mentoring correct ? 

The problem is: how do you optimize the number that everyone will agree upon? Consider that the only disadvantage to naming an unrealistically high number is that you either appear insane/not worth dealing with or that the other side can't find common ground to negotiate on (no point in negotiating with someone who says, "give me one billion dollars just BECAUSE.") So there is nothing wrong with giving a number first, as long as you give them a way to negotiate with you and they feel you are dealing fairly with them. People frequently involved in negotiations hear bizarre reasoning all the time. They deal with otherwise intelligent people who have stupid reasons for the prices they demand (just a little watching of "Shark Tank" should convince you of this). This means there is no point in appearing to be a smart negotiator. In fact, there is advantage in looking like a chump, as long as you don't appear so dumb you won't take their best offer. Collect all relevant salary info, as much as you can, from as varied sources as you can. Anything related to the responsibilities of the job and anything related to someone of your background. Remember you are going to need to explain this in some semi-coherent (but not necessarily intelligent) manner during negotation, so you should take some notes on the details. Then throw out all the lower salaries and leave the very highest. Take the average of this. This should be higher than any number you could possibly have hoped for. Add some wiggle room based on the variance of the entire sample. Or hell, depending on what you find reasonable, just increase this amount by some arbitrary amount that has some meaning to you, like the cost of your ideal vacation. Find a way to fix the data sample to justify this increase. (Later, you can reduce your ask by a similar amount, if they make it up with some generous vacation policy or something -- see where this is going?) Now that you have rigged your sample data to have more than enough justification for the well-meaning chump you are going to represent yourself as, you are ready. When you are asked to give that number, give it to them by first stating, "I believe the market value of an above average (insert position title) is $$$. Due to my experience in (attributes/skills semi-fitting your background), I believe my number of $$$ - (smallish arbitrary number) is more than reasonable; however I understand you might not agree or this may not be within your budget. Please let me know either way and I'm happy to discuss." The point is to appear like you put some thought into it and that the number is based on some reasoning that you are willing to adjust. Now the discussion is on your terms. They are going to have to argue you down, and the result is going to largely be a result of your negotiation skills. But that's a good start. 

I do have an small internal question as to my way of reacting at my current workplace. We are small team with quite broadly defined roles, but with quite overlapping skills and competent members (or so I'd like to think). We are all technical members with a specific main skill though. I have a more senior outlook on the code side of things and believe I can structure and express a technical vision of the project. I am weaker on other aspects too, but that is ok, to each his own. I also have measurable years of service in the IT world. I do have a younger colleague, whom I know is competent, and whom insights I respect, but quite lacking in code quality and structure. He recently was struggling with an aspect of the code, quite ostensibly, and I happen to have implemented said aspect some time ago. I noticed that and proposed some help. He firmly refused said help. It does happen often, and I believe he wants to impose himself, or at least he fears for his competence being put to question - which I do not intent to do, really. He ended up indeed struggling with the problem. I do not want a small team going through power struggles. Now, I personally would like to help, I believe it brings the project further forward. It feels like the sensible, mature thing to do. Now two things: 

I agree with the other answers already posted, but just wanted to suggest that you might want to create different resumes depending on their usage. If you have a LinkedIn profile, and you upload a resume with that profile, I would make sure that that resume is optimized for ATS, so that if employers are generally searching for candidates with specific skills, your resume is likely to be found via that search. If you are responding to a specific job opening, however, I always advise optimizing that resume for that job opening. If possible, use a hybrid resume that looks good and will work with the ATS, but always rework your resume to highlight those skills/positions that you think are most likely to resonate with the particular employer. 

There are probably things here you aren't aware of, as a new employee. Reaching out to her perceived competitors/enemies is not a great suggestion to make. Maybe she's paranoid, or maybe they really are all out to get her. Who knows. You might as well give her benefit of the doubt for now. I'm not saying this is the case, but for all you know, your entire department is constantly under threat of being absorbed into the departments of the people you want to ask for help from. There are many plausible scenarios for her behavior. As you said, she has been there for 40 years. Maybe she knows something you don't. My opinion is that there really is only one negative from what you said. Yes, it is a big one, and only you can make the call, but from what you said, you really like the company and your work -- realize that's something not many people have. 

I am not a doctor, but I was taught that once you have been on antibiotics for 24 hours, or without a fever for the same length of time, you are no longer contagious. Short of debating the accuracy of these statements, as long as you follow these guidelines you are being completely responsible and professional, and should return to work as soon as you feel able to do so. As for the comment by your co-worker--you can also look at it as a positive social interaction. He noticed that you were out, and went out of his way to acknowledge that you are back again. I would assume that he meant it as a humorous way to connect with you, unless and until he proves otherwise by some sort of rude or inappropriate behavior. 

You make it sound as if it was expected from your colleagues. I cannot for one instant imagine your boss, or your service boss, asking this from you. For instance, it often happens that, at small companies, employees gather informally to buy coffee or drinks or what have you. That is just being socially "aware" as far as I am concerned. Now, if you don't feel like participating, which you are totally entitled to, just firmly, but friendly say something like: "I understand that this is the way you do that here, and look no offence, I will not participate since I don't use your kitchen/stuff and [some other reasons/or no reason at all]". It is your very own right, but then if everybody contributes and you are drinking the coffee there, don't be surprised if people give you the cold shoulder. If not, no worries, just say so. 

I faced a similar situation--one of the men in my office took a trip to Thailand and brought back a calendar that featured beautiful topless women, which he then posted on his office wall. I wasn't really all that bothered by it, the office was mostly men, and it was extremely unlikely anyone from outside the company would ever see it. Regardless, I felt it was an inappropriate thing to have in a professional environment, and so I let our HR department know that it bothered me. That would be my suggestion--if you feel like something has the potential to be offensive, which you clearly do--even if you don't personally feel offended, then follow the appropriate procedures to report it. When you do so, it takes the onus off of the manager to take care of it, and pushes it over to the HR folks, who should have some sort of official process for informing the employee. Hopefully informing him in this way will not cause him to lose face in the same manner as he might have by being confronted in the moment, but regardless, it is very important that he understand that this was an inappropriate choice for a workplace environment, so that he won't make the same mistake again.
