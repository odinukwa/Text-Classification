Additionally, many forks offer a travel adjust option (e.g. Rockshox Dual Position and Fox TALAS). They tend to be big, stiff and relatively heavy forks which work best in their longer travel mode, but can be lowered in order to aid climbing up really steep ascents. However, they're far too heavy for XC racers. If you made them light enough for XC racing, they'd be too flexible for the more gravity-focussed riders. Additionally, the adjustable spring can have an effect of the suspension's sensitivity. They're a compromise. By the way, features such as Fox's CTD/ProPedal and Cane Creek's Climb Switch don't usually limit suspension travel. They firm up the shock's Compression (and in some cases Rebound) damping. This is to improve the pedalling efficiency of a longer-travel suspension design, in order to help with climbing, or riding on flatter, smoother terrain. They can still use all of the travel if they need to. The climb setting is a compromise. Those compromises aren't necessarily a bad thing though: They enable me to ride my 150mm travel 30lb bike up and down some of the craziest terrain you can imagine. It'll probalby never win an XC or DH race, but it's still a fantastic bike. 

For English-threaded Ultra Torque, the right (chain) side cup unscrews clockwise, the left one anti-clockwise. For Italian, both unscrew anti-clockwise. It's most likely that you have English. I don't know how you could tell for certain though without asking your bike maker, measuring the size, or seeing which way they actually unscrew. For the reason why the English is 'correct' see the link in the comment below. 

Degreaser or brake cleaner should be just fine on the disks. I've had success with just rinsing pads in boiling water - the heat drives off the oil. 

The best jacket that I've found for cold or cold and wet weather cycling is the Cycle Shirt by Buffalo. The Pertex shell it isn't waterproof at all, but your body heat evaporates all but heavy rain. Contrast this with Goretex, which when soaked on the outside cannot pass water vapour, and so ends up condensated on the inside. 

Different brakes use different designs and different fluids, and as such have slightly different bleed kits and procedures. I've answered what I can below. 

No. It's a trail bike. You'd need to add an extra 40-60mm rear travel for a start. It's also perfectly capable of being ridden down many DH tracks as it is - it just might not like the 40ft gap jumps :) With tongue firmly in cheek, there's a few things you might be able to do, but none of them will turn it into a proper downhill bike. Most of them will void the warranty and/or break the frame! 

First thing to do is check all the pivot bolts are tight. If that doesn't fix it, figure out where the play is. Is it in the swingarm pivot, or the shock bushings? You can figure it out by holding onto each joint in turn and moving the swingarm. You shoukld be able to feel which part is loose. If it's been like it for a while, it might be all three points. Once you find the source of the problem, I guess you'll need to go to your local bike shop (or the place you got the bike - Decathlon?) and see if they're able to source the spare parts. Shock bushings should be easy enough to get, but I don't know about the pivot hardware. You'd need to open it up and have a look what's in there! 

It looks like I burn 100 Calories per hour on average. Do activity trackers report the extra burn due to the activity, or the total including the base. To put it in other terms, if it says 800 kcal for an hour's ride, can I eat an extra 800 kcal or only 700? 

If you're training your muscles - for strength or endurance, I would eat. But if you are training your energy transport and metabolism then there is a lot to be said for not eating. Training on an empty stomach will force your body to burn fat earlier. By spending longer burning fat your body will adapt to this mode and increase its efficiency at doing this, so that your endurance past your stored-glycogen limit will improve. 

I have had one fail, but it was on a second-hand bike and I've no idea what its provenance was. It was sudden, but not catastrophic - I was riding down a 5 mile hill and felt the saddle start to wobble. When I stopped I found the post had cracked in a spiral up its length. The ride home out of the saddle was hard work, but I'd be far less worried about failure in a seatpost than forks or bars. 

Fit a proper DH fork (e.g. a Rockshox Boxxer) and a direct mount stem Bodge a longer stroke shock into the frame (if you can find a pull-shock that long) Now your head angle and bottom bracket are in a crazy place, fit an angle headset (Works Components or Cane Creek) and/or some offset shock bushings (e.g. Burgtec) to put them back somewhere vaguely sensible Fit some heavy duty wheels (e.g. Hope Pro2Evo + Stans FlowEX, or Mavic DeeMax) Remove the front derailleur, and replace it with a single chainring and a chain device Replace the cassette with a close ratio one and switch to a short-cage derailleur while you're at it Upgrade to 203mm disc rotors and Shimano Saint brakes 

You might get lucky and find adaptors from one brand of hub will work in another, but in general that isn't the case. 

I've not done the maths, but angular momentum is proportional to the radius of the circle. So those big wheels benefit a lot from mass reduction, but the relatively small turn around your chainring much less so. Overall I'd think that the chain mass can largely be considered just another part - if it's much cheaper per gram to save weight there than your saddle or bars go for it, otherwise your money may be better spent elsewhere, especially as the chain is a consumable part. 

In my experience any road accident fast enough to hurt will injure you through any clothes you are wearing. I've ended up with badly gashed shoulders and haunches where my shorts and jersey have just been scuffed. The thing that I took away from my last big crash (35km/h onto rough tarmac) was the importance of a helmet obviously, but also how mashed my fingers were, and how bad my palms would have been if I hadn't been wearing mitts. 

Your bike uses a "high direct mount" front derailleur - so yes, you can upgrade to an X0, as long as it's a high direct mount model. SRAM and Shimano both sell "non-group" transmission and braking components, usually only to OEM customers (i.e. the bike manufacturers). This means they aren't in a "group" (e.g. X7, X9, XX1, Deore, SLX, XT, etc) but allow bike manufacturers to hit a certain price point. For instance I've got some brakes and hubs that're roughly equivalent to Shimano Deore components, but they're fairly plain looking, with only a Shimano logo on them. They're perfectly good parts - just not quite as high end / refined as as the ones that get the nice branding. 

Put simply, a master of a craft will be better at it than a "jack of all trades". A dedicated cross country race bike will be better for XC racing than an All Mountain bike. The same would be true of the dedicated downhill race bike. An All Mountain bike strikes a compromise in the middle, making it a good choice for someone who wants to do a bit of everything. It's a bit more complex than that though, e.g. the Specialized Enduro makes different compromises to their Stumpjumper Evo. One is closer to the DH end of the spectrum, while the other is more of an XC/Trail machine. Cherouvim's answer points out some of the compromises (geometry, inefficiency, weight, flex, cost). Others include things like wheel size (XC racers might want a 29er, DH racers a 26er, and Enduro riders — who do a bit of both — might go for 27.5) and axle size (9mm QR is lighter but more flexible than 20mm thru). Which compromise you choose depends on what you want to ride! The "do everything" bike you describe would be complex and compromised, but it does exist: 

I bought a new road bike with Campag Athena 11 speed in March last year. To the end of Jan it had covered 9000km. In all that time I hadn't changed the chain because I don't have the Campag tool, and the KMC chain was not available. I finally got a new chain recently - unsurprisingly the old one was very stretched - so I bought a new cassette as well. The thing is, the new chain on the old cassette runs very smoothly, and even dismantling them and comparing the cogs I can't see any change in shape or size! I don't know what Campag are making them out of, but it's fantastic stuff. Everyone I've spoken to is convinced that after 9000km on one chain the cassette will be useless, but the prevailing advice is also to change the cassette when there are issues, and there just don't seem to be any. 

I don't know about the current Avid brakes, but Avids do have a reputation for being really difficult to bleed properly. The older levers also trapped air above the bleed port. For current Shimano brakes I use a syringe and push fluid through from the bottom to the top when bleeding them. 

In general, no, there is not a "a best suspension frame" (just as there is no best car, best breed of cat, or best person). There are loads of different suspension designs (single pivot, FSR, DW Link, Maestro, VPP, URT, iDrive, ABP, Switch, Pathlink, Droplink, to name only a few), each with their own distinct advantages and disadvantages. There are also a lot of different types of bike, aimed at different types of riding. What works for World Cup cross country might not work for downhill racing, at RedBull Rampage or even on trail bikes. They all make a different set of compromises. There are also a lot of different people with different riding styles, priorities and preferences. There's so much more too add into the equation, too (sizing and geometry, cockpit, wheel size and so on). So while there might be a best suspension frame design for a given rider on for a certain trail, there is no single suspension design that stands out above all others in all situations. Have a read of $URL$ which provides a good primer on the topic. 

I need to remove the bottom bracket bearing cups from my 2010 Athena groupset. Do they both unscrew anti-clockwise, or is one side different (and which one)? 

Overall it was a hoot, and I heartily recommend it, but you do have some major cons as well as pros compared to a normal bike. 

Where can I find free online spinning or turbo classes? Ideally videos, but just audio or even an annotated playlist would do. 

I've had a couple of road crashes in the last 3 years. One I hit a patch of ice and ended up sliding sideways down the tarmac. In the other I was clipped by the rear wheel of the guy in front (ok, maybe I clipped him, hard to say) and went down clipped in and over the bars. In neither case, nor most of my mountain bike crashes, do I remember having any time to react - I was aware that I was in trouble, and then on the ground bleeding. So I'm not sure that any strategy would have helped me out. Ironically, this is coming from someone with 20 years experience of aikido! I think that my last crash was a pretty perfect ukemi, judging from injuries I received, but it sure wasn't a deliberate act. 

Once you've spent all that money, you'll have a complete mess of a frankenbike that doesn't work anywhere near as well as a proper DH bike. As Vorac commented, you're better off buying used. The Specialized Status is a good value place to start looking. With that said, an angle headset might help make the bike more confident on the descents, without completely ruining it. 

I suspect Shimano don't consider it to be necessary for their brakes. The fluid used in Avid and Shimano brakes is completely different, so I imagine it needs to be handled differently. 

Only with manufacturer-specific parts, and only with hubs that were designed to be adapted (e.g. you could probably adapt a 15mm bolt-thru hub to 9mm, but not the other way around). For example, Hope will sell you adaptors to let you use Pro 2 Evo hubs with these drop-outs:
