It could be an anti-catabolic cassein protein that is combined with other stimulating ingredients like creatine, caffein, etc. But I would not advice you to eat right before a workout. It's not natural and your digestive system takes away a lot of your energy. As long as you don't post the full ingredient list I can not give you a full and correct explenation for your question. 

In my experience I would say none. A tennis elbow is an inflammotory injury of your tendon that needs to rest. Keep it could and make shure you rest enough. You could also take a five day cure of an inflammation blocker while you are resting. If you will not rest with this injury, it will only become worse... 

Like Tsvetan says, you can't cure tireness. BUT you can cure the stress you get from work type stuff... My advice to you is to put some PLAY in your training. Make it fun. Don't just do boring routine repetitive movements, but try to add some game characterestics to it. Winning should not be your main goal here. PLAY itself is. It brings your MIND & BODY in the here and now. This relieves your body from the stress you bring home from work. After a training of play you will feel a lot different and more relaxed. I do this kind of training when my clients are to stressed out for a normal personal training session and it works very good. If you want more info on how to put more play in your usual training methods take a look at these names on the web: -Frank Forencich -Mark Sisson -Erwan Le Corre -Ian O'Dwyer -PTaGlobal Play Another option is running a 3km run barefoot. This also takes your mind completely of work for some time because you have to be 100% alert for sharp rocks and stuff. It also improves your running technique so that's two for the price of one if you ask me :) 

If you're a programmer that means you're sitting most of the time. This implicates that the muscles of your backline are overstretched constantly and the muscles of your front line are over tensed. This outs in an aching pain in the lower part of your back. Your orthopedists are right. You can fix this with exercise. BUT And this is a great but. Fixing this kind of problem is not easy. You should really talk to a good personal trainer. Conventional fitness exercises just don't cut it and can make your injury even worse. If you do the wrong exercises the situation of imbalanced tension between your frontal and back muscle chains will even get worse. I strongly recommend you NOT to do any conventional abs exercises like set-up, cruch, ... . This is an advice given by people who follow convenional wisdom. This will make your injury even worse! You should not do any intensive sports before your problem is fixed. If you really want to sport before your problem is fixed then I advice you to go for a swim. You should do exercises that stretch/open your frontal muscle chains and relax your back muscle chains. That way the tension in your back will dissapear. It's hard to do this with conventional exercise so forget training on endurance, with weights, ... A good personal trainer should know how to handle your problem. Once you start training you should already see improvement after a few trainings. 

Myofibrillar and Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy do not lend themselves to being a black and white "it's either one or the other" result. Depending on your initial muscle mass levels, you may put on mass which will be sustained simply because it's muscle you should have had to begin with. In that case, putting on mass would not mean it's sarcoplasmic. Nor does it have to be 100% Myofibril density increase. It can be a combo which favors one or the other. As far as the benefit of mass goes, let me first correct the previous poster on his nomenclature; There is no such thing as an 'Olympic Powerlifter'. It's either Olympic Weightlifter OR Powerlifter. Powerlifting is not an olympic event, nor are the two disciplines the same in the execution of their respective lifts. A powerlifter squats, bench presses, and deadlifts, competing in one of many federations at state, regional, national, or world level. An olympic weightlifter snatches (not a power snatch - a full snatch) and clean and jerks (not a power clean - a full clean and jerk), competing under ONE ruling body (the International Weightlifting Federation) and ultimately the goal is to compete in the olympics (if your lifting weights to be a weightlifter and not a just a fitness enthusiast). Strongman Competition I'm not as clear on in terms of ruling bodies. They were under 'Worlds Strongest Man" but that may have changed, and there may be more than one now. Anyway, strongmen compete in a whole variety of odd object lifting, truck pulling, and grip / carrying feats. Enough on that. I am a competitive powerlifter in the American Powerlifting Federation in the 242 lb weight class. My opinion is that training for hypertrophy is NOT critical when you are trying to improve your power lifts. It would stand to reason that this is true of olympic weightlifting also. The main reason why is that these are weight class sports. Thus, the stronger you are, while being as light as you can be will be to your benefit. Let me use an example; The weight class below me is 220 lbs. I lift in the 242 lb class because I actually weigh 233 lbs. So let's say another lifter weighs 239 lbs. Both of us compete at 242 and we achieve the same three lift total of 1,500 lbs. I will win because I am actually lighter even though we are both in the 242 class. Excess fat is obviously the worst. But excessive hypertrophy can be bad too. There are tons of examples of people who are super strong in powerlifting and very light relative to what they lift. Bob Peoples deadlifted 725 at 180 lbs of bodyweight. Lamar Gant deadlifted 688 at 132 lbs of bodyweight, squatted 595 and benched 352. Dr. Fred Hatfield has a whole list of his accomplishments at various body weights here: $URL$ Rock Lewis benched 600 lbs raw in July 2007 at 241 lbs of bodyweight. Brian Cass has all three of his lifts over 700 lbs at a bodyweight in the 220's. It goes on and on... John Inzer, Eric Cressey, ... Getting bigger DOES NOT necessarily mean getting stronger. And training for hypertrophy specifically is a waste of time in my opinion. Just be careful when you research this because their are guys 275 lbs and over who squat and deadlift in the 900 lbs and some over 1000, as well as some ultra heavy bench presses. You have to pay attention to whether they are using gear or not - by that I mean squat suits and deadlift suits and bench shirts. The geared (or equipped) bench is over a grand already. The raw world record is 715 lbs. So make sure you know what you're reading before you make conclusions. All the lifts above, with the exception of some of Hatfields lifts, are all raw. 

This answer comes after 5+ years of the question being asked, so its directed more to a future searcher than to the OP. The first time I ran just 1 km on loose sand (on the beach) I actually had aching legs, abs and glutes for 1-2 days after running. Same as the OP, I'd been running varying lengths on various kinds of surfaces without any problems. The aching abs and glutes indicate that sand running works the "core" rather intensely. Running on sand is very different from running of a proper surface - in addition to a greater range of motion, your legs need to work harder (implying greater stress on just about every muscle/tendons/ligaments in the leg) to push off with every step - the little stabilizer muscles which are rarely used on regular surfaces need to kick into action on a soft surface. More importantly, due to the shifting nature of loose sand your core works a lot harder to just maintain balance and posture (hence the need for strong core/glutes). So overall, of you overdo it without practice, you'll have the usual stress related injuries. But if you work up to it and do the necessary core strengthening exercises, you might come to actually enjoy it as a thorough workout, as I now do. You'll also notice that running on sand significantly improves your sense of balance and helps improve (both speed and posture) your regular running as well. 

I usually drink about a liter of water after waking up every morning and go running (2x/week 5k and 1x/week 10k+) shortly (15-20 mins) after. I never feel any discomfort due to the full stomach. But recently I was warned this is "bad"; are there any physiological reasons behind this, or merely a matter of convention? Edit (after answers): As I found out recently, this sort of thing (running on a full stomach, e.g. shortly after lunch) is done often enough in various military academies/bootcamps. So it is really unlikely to be physically harmful. 

Disclaimer: I'm not an expert and you need to ask a good physio/sports-doctor. In my experience (also backed up by that of many others, just check bodybuilding related forums), the body adapts to whatever activity you regularly engage it in. This is one of the major reasons people are often advised to switch up their workouts/routine when they plateau at a certain level. Just changing things can be surprisingly effective. In the context of your problem: you've adapted to whatever style of running you were engaged in. Presumably a lower cadence implies longer distance per step and knees rising higher. This is what your muscles and tendons/ligaments were used to. A faster cadence works the system differently. I'd suggest treating the faster cadence business as a "new" thing, and starting out small (short distance bouts at the new cadence) and only increasing slowly. Other things you might also need to check: if your striking (forefoot/heel first) is still the same, shoe cushioning (very soft is bad for high cadence) (try medium if not hard), if shoes are designed for your pronation type, and your "balance" (try running on loose sand). Other things you need to do: rice (rest/ice/compress/elevate) the bad knee, knee strengthening exercises, core strengthening exercises. Good luck and see a physio, ideally one experienced with running. It does sound like ITBS. PS: I've had itbs for similar reasons, as well as from switching hard and medium soles frequently, and from increasing distance too quickly. PPS: listen to your body, don't push your way through these symptoms - learn to recognise/distinguish the pain of tiredness/exhaustion from an actual potential physical problem. You can push trough the former but need to respect the latter. Oh, and stretch plenty. Before and after. Even during if you feel stiff.
