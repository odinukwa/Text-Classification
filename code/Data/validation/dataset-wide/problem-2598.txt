I have found hard to get stories and teachings of Buddha in the book Manual of Buddhism by Hardy Spence. Is Manual of Buddhism by Hardy Spence, a good book to study Buddhism? 

I am hopeful that I will attain Anatta. After I attain Anatta I will cease to be expressible. That hope motivates me to give up the clinging to forms, feeling , perception , consciousness etc... But what about the clinging to the hope of getting Nirvana...? Should I give up hope of getting Nirvana in order to achieve Anatta or Nirvana ? 

In other words when self identification with forms,feelings,perception,consciousness and/or volitional formations occur such a view as highlighted by you also occurs. I think the the wrong view of moral nihilism gets generated when we say that every self ceases to exist after death(i.e body and self are same) or that every self lives for eternity(i.e body and self are different). In both the case following holds true : 

Here, Shakyamuni is saying that the true aspect of all phenomena is that it has no existence. Another way to say this is that causes don't have intrinsic implications; only effects do. It also is to say that, whatever happens, that doesn't mean anything other than that that happened; how one reacts is all that matters. Here one can see how Shakyamuni's statments of the true aspect of all phenomena can be easily applied to our day-to-day lives, so the next logical step is to have a system of, in essence, figuring out which different effects one can create from any phenomena. This leads us into the next philosophical idea. 

In a relative sense, it is obvious that the father is the cause of the child's immediate suffering. That is plain to see. If the father was not abusing the child, then at least this one suffering would not exist. On a deeper level, however, all suffering is caused by karma. That is one of the four noble truths. For the father, his karma has ripened in a negative way such that it bears the fruit of abuse. His karma also has likely placed him in an environment to lead to such a situation. The father's suffering in this situation is thus caused by his own karma. For the child, his/her karma has ripened in such a way that he/she is in a relationship that has fostered abuse against him/her even if it is not the child's direct immediate responsibility. It is the law of cause and effect - the child's suffering was the result of ripened karma. The child was born into a specific circumstance and so on, and so forth. This does not mean that the child bears guilt for the situation at all. We, especially Westerners, develop attachment to the victim in a situation and produce a dualistic mindset of perpetrator vs. victim. On a relative level this is important - the father should be punished under the law. However, according to Buddhism, we develop equanimity for all. We feel equal compassion for both the child and father as we see with deeper wisdom that the karmic fruits of both parties led (and will lead) to their suffering. But each person bears their own karma - each person bears their own suffering as a result of their karma and the ignorance in their mind. To contrast, I recently read an account of two Tibetan nuns who were imprisoned, tortured, and raped for many years by their Chinese oppressors after the 1959 occupation of Tibet by China. Instead of choosing suffering, however, these women viewed what was happening as the result of karma and thus were able to find peace in the situation in that the karma was being resolved - it would not linger any longer after the events were over. Horrific and horrible as a situation may be, a mind directed towards enlightenment can view any situation and opt to avoid suffering and thus end the negative karma. We can also choose not to act on negative karma (i.e. in the case of the father in the abuse) and avoid it as well. It is not fatalism to hold such a view of karma - each decision is indeed our own responsibility moment to moment. That said, if we are not brought out of ignorance, we may never see it as such and thus cycles of abuse can persist across generations of families. Perhaps the father was abused when a child - you can see how things get complicated quickly. Of course, it would be wrong to simply say, "Well, too bad, that was the karma." That is fatalistic and incorrect and lacking compassion and love. However, once one has received wisdom and had some level of realization, you can see how any one being's suffering, be it human, animal, or otherwise, is the result of their own karma and the subsequent results from karmic causes. It is the cause and effect that has persisted indefinitely backward in time and stopping one's own negative karma is indeed a big part of enlightenment. 

Namo Buddhaya. I am a beginner.I want to dedicate rest of my life developing mindfulness.I know there are four ways of attending mindfulness. I understand all the four ways. However I am not sure how to undertake all the four ways of attending mindfulness. Is there any progressive way of attending different mindfulness techniques? Should I choose different mindfulness technique at different times ? Which mindfulness technique would be useful for me ? 

It is said that Nirvana is not changing. But I found a text here which states that dharma of conditioned arising is unchanging. 

You have got it wrong. You say without consciousness there is literally Nothing. This is not true.Buddha rejected Consciousness as self. But remember Buddha didn't say he became Nothing after attaining Nirvana. Buddha did not answer the question whether Tathagata ceases to exist after Nirvana or continues to live. Therefore it wrong to believe in annihilation of Self or Continuation of Self after attaining Nirvana. Following Sutta will help you understand the nature of those who attain Nirvana: 

Technically the SGI (Soka Gakkai International) is a lay Buddhist group, but there aren't any priests or nuns, so it may also be considered a secular form of Buddhism also. It is an orginization, but in my experience, I have never fealt like they were just trying to get my money or anything like that. There are many meetings that one can attend and there is a strong community emphasis, so you get to know a lot of people. Once a month, there is a big city-wide meeting which people often attend, but there is also a monthly district meeting, which usually comprises a small number of people (~5-20). In addition to that, there are many other meetings which one can attend (many do) outside of these two meetings. Usually at a meeting, there is a part where everyone medetates, and then after that, we often times talk and discuss the certain literary works of Nichiren Daishonin, a buddhist monk from the 1200's. That is where the meeting is more philosophical. After that, there may be food or something like that and people usually just talk with eachother. There are some meetings where there is only medetation (toso), and meetings where there is only philosophical discussion (study meetings). I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for, but that is probably one of the more common sects of Buddhism, so depending on that country you live in and the size of your city, there probably is at least a group of people there who practice. Here's a link to the SGI website if you're interested. 

My questions are : What is the meaning of the fact that Buddha is the root of Dhamma? Similarly what is the meaning of the fact that Buddha is the eye of Dhamma? And what is the meaning of the fact that Buddha is the foundation of Dhamma ? 

Offcourse conscience plays a vital role in the enlightenment. Following quote from this sutta explains how : 

If there is no Self , then what Self is there to be affected by the karma which the non-Self now performs? EDIT: A similar question I guess was asked in Samyutta Nikaya and Buddha replied as follows : " With thy thoughts, which are under the dominion of desire, dost thou dream thou canst overhaul the teaching of the Master " However I not sure what that means. I would be really happy if someone can explain the meaning of that answer from Buddha. 

I've been learning about time and the varyous perspectives that it is viewed through, and it seems like there are two main ways of thought. The first, generally associated as a western mindset, is that time is linear. The second, and this is generally considered more eastern, is that time is considered cyclical. I'm pretty sure that this is also a common way-of-thought in Hunduism, but I'm, in particular, wanting to learn more about the nature of time from a buddhist perspective. Of what I have read sutra-wise (pretty much just the Lotus Sutra), I have only seen time's cyclality being alluded to once, when Shakyamuni Buddha is saying that, at the end of a kalpa, when the world is consumed by fire, his pure land will, although appearing to burn with the rest of the world, stay safe and untouched. I assume from this that at the end of kalpas, it was considered that the world would burn (maybe signifying the start of a new cycle). Anyhow, I'm just wanting to know more about the nuances of Buddhist-cyclical time and how one can comprehend/view the world in such a way. 

And so on, I could keep going, but I think you can see there is much more here than a simple materialist approach can resolve. 

Although I was not present, it sounds like the monks were not referring to "punishment" in the sense of being "punished for sins" by some divine arbitrator. Instead, the fruits of karma (cause and effect) ripen and cause what we name a "rebirth" in a higher, lower, or equal realm. In the Buddhist tradition, anything that is not a human rebirth is perceived as not desirable as the human experience is the one most able to approach enlightenment. Since the fruits of karma come about from one's own actions, it would be self-inflicted "punishment" - perhaps not the best choice of words but not wholly inaccurate. Is it punishment if you fall to your death after jumping off a cliff? We might say it is gravity "punishing" an individual in such a situation - such is the verbiage here. In Buddhism, it is up to you to experience your own karma. Nobody judges you for it or can change it for you, but karma will allow you suffer the consequences of your decisions. Interestingly enough, the Buddha contradicted himself on a number occasions depending on the crowd he was speaking to. This was due to the skillful use of words to explain something to his listeners in a way that they could understand. Have you thought that perhaps the monks in this case were employing skillfulness in a similar manner to describe these things in such a way that it would cause you to wrestle with these concepts? As an aside, it sounds like the real problem may be with the question of rebirth and a desire to object to any language centered around it. If indeed rebirth existed, then would you still have an issue? There are a number of highly realized individuals throughout history that have claimed either experience or insight into other planes of experience. That said, I have wrestled with the concept of rebirth in the past and can't say that I have solved it but I would put forth a few thoughts: 

I'm wondering if pali has a specifically designated word for the view that the outer world is a reflection of one's own life state, not the other way around. Additionally, I am wondering if there are any good recources that people know of online that acts as a pali dictionary for buddhist philosophical concepts. 

The 3000 Realms is an philosophical theory developed by T'ien-T'ai, a Chinese buddhist philosopher. It is to say that the, "entire phenomenal world exists within a single moment of life (2)". The realms themselves are used as a way to "categorize" the phenomenal world. Below is a chart explaining how he came up with 3000 realms: (2) The Ten Worlds (or Ten Spiritual Realms) are basically thought to be the full spectrum of one's life condition, which comes from ones life force (i.e. how one feels). I'm not entirely sure where the concept of the ten worlds comes from, although I believe it is a relatively universall concept, at least within Mahayana Buddhism. In short, however one feels can be represented as one of the "Ten Worlds", or "Spiritual Realms". The part of the chart which lists it as "The Ten Worlds and Their Mutual Possession" is referring to the fact that T'ien-T'ai considers the ten worlds to exist within each other. That is to mean that, even in the realm of hell, one can exist in a realm of buddhahood. An example from history of this concept would be of Martin Luther-King Jr.. He led the civil rights movement in America for some time and did so peacefully and, as far as I know, ethically too. One may say that he often times existed in one of the upper worlds like Buddhahood or Bodhisattva (I don't know the Ten Worlds well enough to be able to say with much confidence which particular world he was in while he was working for Civil Rights). Anyhow, while he was doing that though, he was angry because of the injustice of how he and other people were being treated and that motivated him. However, the important distinction to be made is that, although he was angry, he didn't act violently, he still thought and acted like one who was in one of the higher worlds would act. The inclusive world which he often dwelled in was Anger, even though he was in one of the higher worlds nonetheless. Another important aspect of the Ten Worlds is that the entirety of them exist intrinsically within us at all times and one can, moment-to-moment, move from one world to the next- either up or down. That is to say that, at all times, for all people without exception, the World of Hell exists within us, but so does Buddhahood. -- The next part of The 3000 Realms is The Ten Factors. This theory too comes from the Lotus Sutra in the second chapter (Expedient Means) and is expounded by Shakyamuni to Shariputra and goes as follows: 

The base (most subtle in Buddhist terms) awareness we experience seems to be the exact same awareness that animals and even insects experience. I am not talking about intellect or cognitive abilities but the simplest base sense of "experiencing the world around us". Personally, meditation on this concept has helped. "Hells", "Heavens", and the like could simply be states of mind. In some ways, we are born, live, and die moment to moment as each moment causes the next, and a bad mindstate in any given moment could indeed be considered "hellish". Modern neuroscience has not been able to pin down if human experience is indeed purely physical or if it is perceived by the brain. I have corresponded with numerous neuroscientists on Quora and have found a consensus that this is still the elephant in the room. Sure, we can see how the brain uses nerves to send a signal to my fingers to tap the keys on my keyboard. But the actual experience that decides to initiate the tapping? That is still elusive. Modern quantum physics involves reality coming into being when there is an observer. Perhaps our experience is the observer when a quantum wave collapses? If so, it is independent of the physical universe it observes. (On yet another side note, the overlap between Buddhism theory of mind and quantum physics is a fascinating study) 

I personally have a hard time explaining The Ten Factors and so I'll also add a link that describes The Ten Factors (3) more clearly. To the best of my understanding, The Ten Worlds are how we feel emotionally, and the Ten Factors are how we project ourselves upon the world and how these two concepts interact with each other. -- The final part of The Three Thousand Realms is called, "The Three Realms". I know the least about this part of the Realms, and so my explanation for it probably wouldn't be complete, but there are many websites which I think would be able to better explain them. Everything that I would be able to say about them is addressed in the image I added above, so I'll stop here. -- What is important to know about The 3000 Realms as a whole is that they describe all of the possible effects within a single moment of life. It also means that everything is subjective - in terms of point-of-view - and that all things are equal. The reason that I have included the concept of The 3000 realms is because it shows that not just Shakyamuni has a life force, and also that one's enlightenment (world of Buddhahood) intrinsically exists within one's self (as well as every other realm).
