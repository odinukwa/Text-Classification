In each of the Philippics, Demosthenes rails against Philip's underhandedness and his fellow citizens' cowardice and complacency. References to money are generally confined to questions of raising funds for war and there is no reference to gold mining by Philip. The fourth Philippic talks the most about money, and in that, Demosthenes indicates that inflation is not a problem: 

England held the ascendancy for a long time in France because it had two very capable leaders in Henry V and the Duke of Bedford at a time when France was wracked by internal strife. But a successful occupation required a lot of factors to continue in their favour. Whatever England's successes on the battlefield, the Burgundian alliance, French disunity and particularly the English financial situation could not have been expected to hold forever. Sources: 

Joan of Arc Or rather, God. Before her arrival on the scene, it had appeared to English and French alike that God was on England's side. Her contribution to the lifting of the siege of Orleans gave some hope to the Dauphinist cause, and for a while, a belief that God was on their side. The emphatic victory at Patay and the coronation of Charles VII further enhanced this view. Desmond Seward wrote that: 

The Greeks had demonstrated military superiority over the Persians for many years. Both Cimon and Agesilaus had led successful expeditions into Persian territory. That Persia maintained its dominant position over Greece had not so much to do with their own military capabilities, but rather because of the incessant warfare amongst Greek cities. Their focus on destroying each other drained their resources and enabled Persia to make territorial gains in exchange for money supporting one side or another in the Greek wars. Plutarch lamented that when Agesilaus met with success in Asia Minor and was intending to march on to the Persian capitals, he was instead ordered back to Sparta by the ephors to fight against other Greeks. The Macedonia that Alexander left behind was very different to the Greek city states. Alexander did not have the restraints imposed by ephors, voters and term limits, so had much freedom in his military planning. Macedonian conquests under Philip and during Alexander's early reign set the foundations for the conquest of Persia. The subjection of their neighbours, including a weakened Greece, enabled Alexander to march without fear of suffering Agesilaus' plight. The conquered wealth, including from the gold mines of Amphipolis, could pay for a military substantially larger than that under Agesilaus while still leaving enough troops to protect the homeland. The allure of Persian treasure was also a great incentive for those in the much poorer Greece to take to arms. I do not share Livy's assessment that Alexander would have failed against Rome. The situation of Perseus is not a valid comparison. At that time, Rome was already the dominant power of the western world while Macedonia had lost much of its power and was commanded by less capable generals. A better choice would be the example of Pyrrhus, commanding a smaller territory and fighting some 50 years later when the Romans had grown in power, who was successful in battle against the Romans but ultimately lost the war due to insufficient reserves. Alexander was better resourced and would not have had this problem. More importantly, the Romans had not in Alexander's time adopted the tactical changes that would give them superiority over phalanxes in later years, so he would also not suffer as severe losses as Pyrrhus did. Alexander would not have been able to defeat Carthage, as that would have either required naval superiority or a massive overland march. 

During Persia's invasion of Greece under Xerxes, Ephialtes betrayed the bunch of Greeks at the very strong defensive position at Thermopylae by showing the Persians an alternate path around the pass. This led to the complete defeat of the Greek army and the death of the Spartan king Leonidas, and opening the way to the sacking of Boeotia and Athens. While I can see the argument that this was unsuccessful because the Persians ultimately lost the war, the fact that it gave the Persians control of a decent chunk of Greece for a year and that they lost for a wholly unrelated reason (mostly due to Salamis) would make this at least a short term success. In the turmoil at the end of Qin, Qing Bu was one of the most important generals of Xiang Yu, who became the hegemon. After the fall of Qin, Liu Bang and Xiang Yu vied for the throne. Qing Bu later joined Liu Bang and attacked Xiang Yu in the rear, and was critical to the eventual defeat of the latter. Towards the end of the Later Han, Liu Zhang was an independent governor of Yizhou. When he heard that Cao Cao intended to attack his northern buffer state of Hanzhong, he was convinced by his advisor Zhang Song to invite in Liu Bei to help protect Yizhou. However, both Zhang Song and Fa Zheng, who was sent to welcome Liu Bei, were secretly plotting to have him displace Liu Zhang. Despite initially protesting that he could not behave so treacherously to his own kin, Liu Bei eventually found an excuse to act. A number of other generals betrayed Liu Zhang during this conflict and Liu Bei was ultimately successful. Zhang Song didn't live to see it though. He lost his head when his brother informed Liu Zhang of his actions. 

The need for a pristine image of Henry V to serve as an English propaganda tool (including as recently as WW2) has led to some of his more questionable acts being glossed over. I'll leave the last word to Seward's final sentence of the introductory paragraph quoted above: 

By the time that Qin had totally collapsed, Xiang Yu was China's hegemon. He allotted governance of different parts of the country to various men. Some, like Tian An of Qi and Wei Bao of Wei, were descendents of the prior kings of those areas, while people like Wu Rui of Hengshan were given their posts based upon distinction. All of them had full control of their own forces and were largely free to pursue their own policies. Liu Bang was one of these kings, and some of the others submitted to him in the fight against Xiang Yu. Liu Bang also relied upon three key generals - Han Xin, Peng Yue and Qing Bu - each of whom were promised the position of king as the condition for their assistance. Thus, at the formation of Han, Liu Bang found his territory full of kings who commanded the loyalty of their forces and expected a great deal of autonomy as reward for their services. While he had his own military force (the conscript Southern Army and the professional Northern Army, both based in Changan) and could theoretically command the kings as he pleased, the size of their territories made practical enforcement of this difficult. As Qing Bu demonstrated, it was quite feasible for a king to revolt and be a genuine threat to the empire. Liu Bang therefore spent a lot of time removing the various kings (either by plots or putting down rebellions) and replacing them with his relatives (Wu Rui was eventually the only non-relative king remaining). Even with relatives in charge, the central government could be at the mercy of the kings, as demonstrated by the rebellion of seven kings under the reign of Emperor Jing. One of the responses to this was an imperial decree that territory should be split up between a king's sons rather than passing in full to a single heir, announced with the excuse that the Emperor was acting out of kindness to all princes but really intended to dilute the power of kings and limit their ability to threaten the Emperor. Another was the establishment of commanderies in locations that inhibited the kings' ability to cooperate. Commanderies had existed from the start of Han and were headed by centrally appointed officials. Initially, many commanderies were near the capital Changan, but as time passed, they were established also in strategic locations such as between potentially troublesome kings and along the empire's frontiers. A key part of the power of Liu Pi, the leader of this rebellion, was his ability to mint his own coins and the abundant ore available to do so from his territory. Eventually, this power was removed and all minting of currency was done within three central offices (there were still counterfeit coins, but they couldn't be made on a scale that could sustain a rebellion).

I'm not as familiar with the poliical history of other countries. Some examples of those who have not resigned from parliament straight after resigning as Prime Minister are John Major (UK), Margaret Thatcher (UK), Paul Martin (Canada) and Jenny Shipley (NZ). 

Proxy marriage is a wedding in which at least one of the lucky couple is absent, with a proxy filling in instead. It was fairly common amongst the nobility in the middle ages to engage in this practice. One intriguing instance that I have read is that between Philip II of Spain and Elizabeth of France, with the Duke of Alba acting as a proxy for the former. The process included a consummation in which Elizabeth and the Duke of Alba went to bed with one leg naked each and touched these legs against each other. When and where did this practice originate? In the original case, what problem was it intended to solve? How long did it take for the practice to receive official or widespread recognition?
