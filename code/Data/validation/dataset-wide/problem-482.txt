It's the most common kind of threadless headset. External cups, caged bearings. It uses a 5/32x20 retainer (bearing size x count), which again is the most common type and available online and at most shops for cheap. If you want you can also use loose 5/32" balls, which is more of a hassle but slightly better for headset longevity because you get more contact area and loose balls migrate around more freely and reduce pitting. 

The only other piece you'd need to know is the actual total cable pull of your SL-BS77 9-speed bar end shifters, which requires measuring since 9*2.5 doesn't work because it's got some phantom movement both before and after its normal range of clicks when in indexed mode. I have them on a bike so I undid the low limit, put it in friction, put a mark on the cable and came up with 24.5mm total movement. So, the answers: Shimano 10 with a 10-speed Shimano road RD works because 24.5*1.7=41.65 (the total amount of derailer movement you get) and 3.95*10=39.5 (the minimum total range you need, here a smaller number than the 41.65). Shimano 10 with a 10-speed mountain RD doesn't work because 24.5*1.2=29.4. Shimano 11 with an 11-speed Shimano road RD doesn't work because 24.5*1.4=34.3 (derailer range movement), which is less than 11*3.9=42.9 (range needed). Shimano 11-speed mountain RDs have an even lower actuation ratio (1.1) so we know that won't work either. So in other words, all the 11-speed shifters pull quite a bit more cable, so this friction shifter and probably many others out there in the world can't really sub in for them, primarily because the actuation ratio the systems run on has been made quite a bit different than in the past, plus the cassette itself is a little wider. You could almost do it by just using an older derailer with the 1.7 ratio, but not quite (24.5*1.7=41.65, and we need 42.9). Hacking the cable anchor to tweak the ratio by that much is probably achievable. Campy 10 with a 10-speed Campy RD won't work, because 24.5*1.4=36.75, and 4.15*10=41.5. But it will work, barely, with a Shimano RD with the 1.7 ratio. 

This isn't a formula for you so maybe not the answer you're looking for, but it gets tricky because a fork isn't just a straight line; because it has offset it's kind of like a triangle itself for the purpose of doing the exact math here. The thing most people who care about this question would do in practice is model the frame's fixed points in a 2d CAD program, model the forks in question (remembering that to do so you're making a right triangle where the axle to crown dimension is the hypotenuse, the offset dimension is one leg, and the other leg is an unknown length that can be solved for or figured out automatically in CAD), then plug each fork in to the frame model such that the unknown leg is in line with the head tube, and then pivot the whole thing around the point of the rear axle until the front axle snaps to being in plane with the rear. Then you can see the resultant head angles and BB heights easily. You can also easily see what angle changes at the headset would give you. There are many free 2d CAD programs that can do all this. 

If there's a way to get out the broken bit with a suitably powerful magnet, that's got to be by far the approach that causes minimal further complication. Getting a replacement bleed screw for this brake may be pretty difficult (or Tektro may just have one to send, who knows). It is critical to use the right screw and o-ring so that the seal works. Cow magnets are pretty strong and readily available, and the right shape. Of course a pickup magnet or computer magnet may be more readily on-hand. There may be some creative way you can figure out access to an electromagnet. Drilling into the tool steel of the broken bit without destroying everything else does not seem very realistic to me. In theory you could find something to bond a tool to the screw and broken bit, unscrew it, then use heat to undo the bond. In practice whenever I try something like this the bond doesn't really get strong enough. Using an adhesive to pull on the broken bit is pretty likely to get it stuck in worse, although it's true that in theory this might be avoidable. You have the advantage that the broken parts probably want to mate closely and provide lots of surface area. You might try cleaning the surfaces with alcohol on a q-tip, put a very tiny dot of epoxy on the connection point, sticking it on and securing with a rubber band, and leaving it for its full cure time. If you can avoid using enough epoxy that any spills out the crack of the bit, you should be safe from making it worse this way. 

Doing this without machine tools would mean using a die. Left drive freewheels have left hand threads in 1.375x24 and M30x1, and M30 is too small here. Off the shelf dies exist for neither in left threading. 

The thinking with them is to protect the contact point from contamination and provide a slick surface, reducing friction. They do achieve that to an extent, especially early in their life. The problem is when the liner itself starts junking up with grime that can't be easily removed, it will then cause friction problems itself. For this reason, I think going without is fine in many cases. Some bikes use them to prevent cables from rubbing the frame on painted surfaces, raw carbon, etc. In that case I would not recommend going without. You can get replacement pieces from inside shift housing. Take a long piece, cut the outer plastic down it longitudinally with a razor, then whip it hard against a hard surface. The wire strands will come apart and you can take the liner out. 

I've heard the notion that by tugging down on the valve aggressively as you inflate it, you might be able to mitigate the problem. I'm highly dubious but it may be worth trying. I've been able to fix it seemingly for good by layering pieces of rim tape and/or tube at the valve to build up the area there, essentially creating a more normal face for the valve to interface with. I used electric tape to hold them in place and I layered several lengths of them to create a little bit of a taper effect to smooth the transition. A normal rim strip then goes on top of all that. I believe I cut the valve hole on each of the layers first. Note that doing this on most rims could easily create problems with the tire bead not wanting to seat evenly near the valve, but from what I can tell this issue tends to come up on rims that are odd-shaped with deep well sections. 

They all have some play in the fit. The target outside dimensions for the most common bike hex wrench sizes (4, 5, and 6mm) are all around .1mm less than the bores they fit in, which match the nominal sizes with a tolerance of I think +/-0.05mm-ish. That shouldn't lead you to feel they're "very" loose, but they typically aren't exactly snug. Very loose suggests using imperial aka fractional/SAE wrenches, whereas virtually all Allen bolts on bikes are metric. The only exceptions I've encountered are certain 90s BMX stems. That it's Chinese is here nor there. 

This is conjecture, but one avenue for a pretty simple fix achievable with hand tools and no real special skills could be making a seatmast by bonding a pre-made carbon tube of a suitable OD into the hole with epoxy, (presuming the ID of the seat tube is consistent enough for this to make sense) and then using an off the shelf seatmast topper on the top of that tube, possibly with some intermediary aluminum or carbon shim material in the way as needed. Or if the IDs worked out and you were willing to make a non-adjustable seat mast, you could steal a bonded-in saddle clamp from an old seatpost and bond it back into the ID of the mast tube. 

The exact difference can't be easily quantified in terms of how short is too short. The closer in you get, the more amplified an effect your steering inputs will have, creating a feeling of touchiness. It's not optimal, but it's a pretty subtle downside and well worth it if it's what it takes to get comfortable. Comparing bars with different amounts of reach (and drop, especially since most bars with smaller reach numbers will also be shallow drop), a major consideration is that the smaller the number, the less variance is created between the different hand/body positions. That's why it makes sense for the size of the reach/drop numbers to scale with the size of the person. 

Among bike parts manufacturers, the norm by a very wide margin is for there not be sidedness. There are exceptions, such as hubs that use sealed cartridge angular contact bearings, but I believe those always have different color seals on each side, and there's not very many companies that use them. And there are some cases such as Campy freehubs where you remove one side's seal before installing it. As I understand it, the seal (closure) type code you see on the seal of a bearing describes the type of sealing used by the closure it's inscribed on. I believe that in all cases, if it says the same thing on both sides, you don't have to worry about sidedness. 

Yes, that is a crack, or at least looks to be with about as much certainty as a pic can provide. That's a relatively common place for cracks to occur, with the thick square-edged boss creating a stress riser on the thin tube. That the line of it continues into the area where a shifter or cable stop would cover the paint adds to my doubt that it's a scratch in the paint. 

The first diagnostic step from where you are is make sure the little screw on the front of the lever is snug, then disconnect the cable from the RD, pull away the housing from the lever, confirm the cable is intact and not jammed/fraying inside the shifter, and gently tug on the bare cable as you shift back and forth through the gears. If it feels normal there, including the 3-4 shift you're having trouble with, then the shifting problem is of the mundane variety, i.e. excess cable friction, hanger alignment, tweaked derailer, improper setup, etc. If it isn't shifting correctly even as you're tugging on the bare cable, you need to figure out if it's a broken spring or other internal part or if it merely needs cleaning and re-lubrication. It's usually obvious if something is broken, but if not you can do the clean/lube step first. There are different ways of doing this, but the quick and dirty one is just flush it good with silicone spray lube, working the pawls back and forth with a pick if they're accessible, and also putting a dot of grease on the pawls if possible in emulation of new STIs. If it's not broken that will make it work again about as reliably as anything else. Alternatively, a more perfectionist approach is unscrew it from the mount, take the hood off, and put the whole thing in an aqueous parts washer without agitation, and then re-lube in a similar fashion as above. If it's broken, you should probably throw it away and get another one. If you want a really questionable new hobby, you could try to track down a donor to steal parts from and do this. The good news is that just getting another replacement used right ST-3300 or new Claris 2400 is pretty feasible and cheap. If you get another one of the exact same shifter, you can play the trick of unscrewing the old one from its mount and putting the new one in its place without even having to redo the tape or brake housing.
