There are some examples given by Pjateckiĭ-Šapiro in Classification of bounded homogeneous regions in n-dimensional complex space. Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 141 1961 316–319. and On bounded homogeneous domains in an n-dimensional complex space. Izv. Akad. Nauk SSSR Ser. Mat. 26 1962 107–124. (I have a vague memory that the smallest examples are 4-dimensional, but might have misremembered.) 

Although one cant find a threshold function with exactly the properties you ask for, there is often something quite close to a threshold function, given as follows: For an integer n, consider all Turing machines of size n such that the given theory can prove they halt with a proof of size at most n. Then define f(n) to be the largest number of steps that any of these machines take before halting. This function is computable if the theory satisfies some form of consistency, possibly omega consistency. The theory cannot show that this is computable, and although there are smaller functions that the theory cannot show are computable, they are in some sense not much smaller. So for most practical purposes it is a threshold function. 

This was answered in the negative by Max Dehn, who showed that it was impossible to cut a cube into a finite number of polyhedral pieces that can be reassembled into a tetrahedron. This was accomplished by associating to each polyhedra $P$, an element $D(P)$ of the group $\mathbb{R}\otimes_{\mathbb{Q}}(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}\pi)$ that is invariant under cutting and pasteing. To obtain his result, Dehn then proved that the cube had value 0 in the group above, and the tetrahedron had a non-zero value. My question is this: is there a more conceptual explanation for why this question should be answered in the negative? In particular, the corresponding statement about polygons is true: given two polygons with the same area, there is a decomposition of the first polygon into polygonal pieces that may be reassembled into the second (see the Wallace-Bolya-Gerwien Theorem). Is there a specific property of polygons that we are exploiting to prove WBG, that fails when we go to three dimensions? 

There are presently no applications of the monster group in physics, though there is a lot of misleading speculation about this. However in the other direction there are some applications of ideas from physics to the monster group. In particular the no-ghost theorem in string theory is used to construct the monster Lie algebra acted on by the monster group. The ideas from physics seem to have no direct connection with the problem of realizing the monster as a Galois group over the rationals. This was solved by Thompson, who showed by character-table calculations that the monster satisfies a sufficient condition ("rigidity") for it to be a Galois group. 

I think the second construction is not correct. If you replace the cover with the category whose objects are all intersections of elements of your original cover, then the two notions agree. 

The question is in the title. I am trying to apply the Mitchell (Freyd-Mitchell?) embedding theorem, which states that for every small abelian category $A$, there exists a ring $R$ such that A embeds into the category $R$-mod. The derived category is not abelian, of course, but I have a particular subcategory that is abelian, and life would be easiest if the derived category was smal, so that the subcategory was small and abelian. 

Some intuition might be given by the following informal analogy with measure theory: if we have a measure space of measure 1, then club sets are analogous to subsets of measure 1, while stationary sets are analogous to sets of positive measure. In other words, club sets contain "almost all" ordinals, while stationary sets contain "a positive proportion" of them. 

Because its Weyl group contains -1. For split semisimple groups in char 0, taking duals corresponds to acting by -1 on the weight lattice, where irreducible polynomial representations correspond to weights modulo the action of the Weyl group. So if -1 is in the Weyl group (acting on the weight lattice), then any (irreducible) representation is isomorphic to its dual. This includes the groups with Dynkin diagrams A1, Bn, Cn, Dn for n even, E7, E8, F4, G2 but not An for n>1, Dn for n odd and E6. 

The idea being to somehow use that$-E$ is nef on $E$. EDIT: the exceptional fibres of $\pi$ are one-dimensional and $R^{\bullet} \pi_*O_V = O_W$ EDIT 2: we may assume that the support of $F$ is one-dimensional 

In general, I am trying to understand why a new notion of open cover is necessary if all I am interested in is remembering stabilizers. Certainly this is too simple a mind-set, so feel free to enlighten me. 

"The Geometry of Moduli Spaces of Sheaves" by Huybrechts and Lehn. Thankfully, it seems that an updated edition is in the works. 

"Without loss of generality" is a standard in the mathematical lexicon, and I am writing to ask if anyone knows where the expression was popularized. (The idea has been around since antiquity, I'm sure, but the expression itself might not be that old.) 

A few of the more obvious ones: * Resolution of singularities in characteristic p *Hodge conjecture * Standard conjectures on algebraic cycles (though these are not so urgent since Deligne proved the Weil conjectures). *Proving finite generation of the canonical ring for general type used to be open though I think it was recently solved; I'm not sure about the details. For vector bundles, a longstanding open problem is the classification of vector bundles over projective spaces. (Added later) A very old major problem is that of finding which moduli spaces of curves are unirational. It is classical that the moduli space is unirational for genus at most 10, and I think this has more recently been pushed to genus about 13. Mumford and Harris showed that it is of general type for genus at least 24. As far as I know most of the remaining cases are still open. 

Let $\pi: V\to W$ be a resolution of singularities, let $E \subset V$ be the exceptional divisor, and let $F$ be a coherent sheaf such that $R^i\pi_*F=0$ for $i>0$. 

In section III.3.4 of Eisenbud & Harris's "The Geometry of Schemes," we/they construct an infinite family of double structures on $\mathbb{P}^1 \subset \mathbb{P}^3$ that are distinguished from each other by their genus. Here is the construction (let's just worry about $\mathbb{C}$ for now): Let $d$ be a non-negative integer, and let $S = \mathbb{C}[u,v,x,y]/(x^2, xy, y^2, u^dx - v^dy)$. Then $X_d = Proj$ $S$ is a double line with arithmetic genus $-d$. Eisenbud and Harris then go on to say that "every projective double line of genus $-d$, with $d \geq 0$, is isomorphic to $X_d$." My question is: where can I find a proof of this statement? More generally: if you fix a curve $C$ of genus $g$, how can I describe the moduli of genus $d$ double curves lying over top of $C$?
