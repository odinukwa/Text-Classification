Strava (Premium) can determine your speed using GPS data, although GPS can be less accurate than a dedicated sensor because it jumps around a bit. There's no magic way to determine cadence without a sensor, except maybe counting it in your head. 

Very cheap tires are likely to have little or no puncture protection. Unless you're riding under very optimal conditions, slightly higher quality tires are worth it when you consider the time/cost of replacing or patching punctured inner tubes. 

Max 32T here refers to the largest rear sprocket, not the total capacity. So with an 11-28 you'll have no problem. 

There's also the somewhat nebulous concept of whether or not "the race is on". Basically if you're cruising along in the peloton it would be extremely bad form to suddenly attack out of nowhere when you hear that the leader has had a mechanical, been caught up in a crash, etc. But if people have already started attacking each other, it's less fair to expect the favorites to stop racing and wait up, potentially wasting whatever opportunities existed on that stage. An example might be if the rider in 5th noticed that the riders in 3rd and 4th are having trouble keeping up. If the person in 1st has a mechanical and the whole group waits up for them, the rider in 5th potentially loses a chance to move onto the podium, through no fault of their own. The "race is on" defense was used in this year's Giro d'Italia. The leader had some "gastric distress" right at the bottom of a major climb, when teams were already fighting each other for position with some in a group out front. The rider in 2nd started to wait up a little, but the other teams were attacking each other, so he had to stay with them. ($URL$ 

I just installed a new chain on my 2002 Trek 2200 Road Bike. The old chain was a Shimano 9 speed that I installed 18 months and about 5000 miles ago. It had stretched modestly and was full of winter cruft/grime. The new chain is a SRAM 9 speed, my first time using the gold snap ring system. I followed instructions and made sure I have the same link count as the chain that came off the bike. The cassette was new with the old chain, so it has about 5000 miles on it and doesn't appear to have significant wear. After installation and a clean/wipe/lube/wipe, I took it for a 15 mile easy ride at about 15-16 mph. It shifts perfectly and I didn't have to make any adjustments to either derailleur. Three times, however, when putting it under stain (once on a modest hill climb, once starting from a stop sign in a fairly big gear, and once on an acceleration coming out of a sharp turn) it skipped several teeth and caused my foot to slam down hard. On the hill, it actually hurt as I had my weight off the saddle (not really standing) and I came down hard on the inside of my thigh. I think all three were on the right side (power train side) pedal stroke, and I don't think they were all in the same gear. I'm pretty sure it was the rear cassette that skipped, not the front chainring, but it did happen really fast each time. I will also say that it's not like these were the only three times I put substantial pressure on the pedals in the ride - I wasn't going hard, but I wasn't being tentative or anything. Also, in case it's relevant, it was cold, about 40 degrees F or about 4 degrees Centigrade. My question: Is this going to get me hurt, or will the new chain 'settle in' over a few rides? I searched here and pretty much got confirmation of what I had previously thought, that you always get a new chain when you get a new cassette, but you should be able to get a few chains out of each cassette. Thanks! 

Standing to pedal won't damage your knees. Supporting and propelling you when you are standing is exactly what knees are designed to do. If anything standing is better for your knees than sitting. When you are sitting down their motion is limited because the top and bottoms of your legs are 'fixed' in position. When you stand your knees and hips can move freely which is a more natural movement. Watch a child riding a bike and you'll notice they naturally spend a lot of time standing up. Standing pedalling does require more core and upper body strength than seated pedalling and maybe that's why your shoulders are aching check out BikeJames.com if you are interested in exercises help with that. As an aside standing pedalling is less efficient than seated pedalling but it lets you put out more power. If you compare top level riders in pretty much any form of competitive cycling you'll see that they spend a lot more time standing up than a comparable recreational rider. 

Go for a ride, and try to get in as much climbing as possible. You'll probably be amazed at how quickly your strength will improve just with three sets of good form concentrated upper body calisthenics pre-ride. Again, if you have dumbbells or a weight bench you could do bench presses/military presses, or laterals, and you could do rows to help with the "pull," but the goal isn't really do to a full on weightlifting session, just some quick calisthenics with one effective push and one effective pull exercise and at least two, preferably three sets as you prep for your ride. 

I believe that the ten speed chains have a narrower link in order to fit the tighter cassette, which might actually cost more to fabricate. I know that in the SRAM chains you have to use a new PowerLock link each time according to the instructions, so it's still tool less but not something you want to use for a weekly cleaning. 

Bedding in brakes removes any glaze from your new pads, and any contamination from your disc rotors. It also transfers material from the pads onto the rotors, which helps them work together. It's essential to get the optimum performance from your brakes when you change pads. Follow these steps: 

Practice braking! With practice you'll get to know when you're about to start skidding and you'll be able to reduce the pressure on the brake levers. Ultimate stopping technique goes like this: 

That's probably all you need to do. However some people, myself included, like to pour water over the hot brakes. I'm not sure this actually improves anything but even if it doesn't it sizzles and steams, which is pretty cool 

If you are having problems lifting the back wheel then you can try practising it on it's own, without lifting the front wheel: 

In terms of components you're tyres are the most important factor in how quickly you stop - wide spaced knobs are good for stopping and softer compounds are better as well. Lowering pressure will improve stopping distance as well. The problem is that tyres that stop well won't roll as quickly. 

The cantilevered dropouts date it from 1989 to 1996, the threadless headset to the later end of that. Based on a quick look through the catalogs here, it looks like a 1995 R700, their entry level triathlon/TT bike, which was sold that year with a polished aluminum frame and black fork. That's making the assumption that it wasn't converted to tri-bars later in it's life. It was had a 2x8 (16 speed) drivetrain, not 3x8 (24 speed), but looking at the picture it looks like you may have miscounted the speeds, I see a double not a triple. The brake levers also don't match, but that's an easy switch so they could be aftermarket. 

I had a pair of stock tires that had the same issue. Unless I physically held the bead in place during inflation, there would be parts just like in the video, where the bead was getting sucked into the rim. It was ridable, but I could feel the dip every revolution. I couldn't find a solution by fiddling with inner tubes and rim tape, but replacing the tires with some higher quality ones totally solved the issue. If it's in your budget I would just replace the tires, better quality ones can make a big difference in ride quality, too. 

Even if you don't read Mastering Mountain Biking Skills (and you should, it's great, and has a section on riding switchbacks) there's a bunch of information on author Lee McCormack's site LeeLikesBikes. 

Get in a low position (if you can - the bike might limit how low you can get). As you increase pressure on the brakes shift you backwards trying to keep you weight in your feet. Drop your heels to drive your weight into the pedals. Brake as hard as you can without skidding. As you come of the brakes gradually move your weight forwards. 

Once your have it dialled you can combine it with lifting the front wheel to hop. Breaking the hop down into two separate components also helps when you aren't carrying enough speed to clear an obstacle in one go - first you can lift the front wheel over, then you can lift the rear. I also recommend you check out LeeLikesBikes for some great information and videos about hopping. Personally I'd always recommend a good pair of flat pedals for learning skills like this - they force you to use good technique instead of 'cheating' by pulling the pedals up. If you can't bunnyhop on flat pedals you can't bunnyhop. 

That's not calculating your lowest gear (which would determine how easily you could ride up a ramp), but the total gear range. So the difference between your fastest gear ratio and your slowest gear ratio expressed as a percent. Generally speaking a wider range means a lower lowest gear, but you could also get a higher range by making your fastest gear faster. This page might also be useful- $URL$ 

For disc brake bikes specifically, you want to have them positioned in the way that makes them easiest to open without touching the discs. For the front this is easily achieved by putting the lever on the right (in whatever orientation you fancy), but you can also have it slightly in front of the fork on the rotor side (behind also works if it's not interfering w/ the caliper). In the rear, I find that just slightly below the chainstay works best for me, making it easy to brace against the chainstay for both opening and closing. 

I wouldn't recommend shoe polish with any dye in it at all, because it's only going to get on your gear, and even "neutral" shoe polish is probably less likely to be formulated for a high friction application like a saddle as opposed to a shoe where waterproofing and "gloss" are the more likely goals. I agree with the previous answer that a natural product is likely to have a better result than the synthetic ones, especially a combination of conditioning oil and wax, like the Proofide that Brooks recommends. 

The "pure" answer to the question as asked is probably as others have said, climb as much as possible. But perhaps a better answer is to admit that cycling is awesome for aerobic fitness and leg strength but not as great on the upper body. Obviously, cross-training is an option, but even if you are 100% committed to your bike, you can probably get significant results from two common calisthenics pre and/or post ride: Push-ups and Pull-ups. The key is that you want to develop your chest/shoulders/triceps (pushing) and your back/biceps (pulling), and doing multi-joint exercises is likely more efficient/helpful than isolation exercises. If you can't do pull-ups and don't have access to a lat pulldown machine you can help yourself by using your legs to give yourself a gentle assist. If you have or can scrounge some dumbbells you can do a bit more. Try this: 

Bike James has a bunch of information on strength training for mountain biking, and he has also created a bodyweight workout. I've been doing his workouts for around six months now and it's made a massive difference to me, both off-road and on my daily commute. Specific exercises I would recommend are the turkish get up (amazingly relevant to cycling), and, focussing on leg strength, deadlifts and squats. If you only have a light pair of dumbbells there are variations of both which will do you a lot of good. 

Clean your rotors - you don't want them to transfer any grease and grime to your new pads. You can buy dedicated brake cleaner. Fit the new pads and find a place where you can build up a bit of speed. A hill is helpful for this. Build up some speed and then brake to a gradual halt. Repeat a few times.
