How does this benefit the team, the organization How does it benefit you, so the result is that is benefits the team, the organization 

After two hours, go to one of them and casually ask how is it going. Or, make it random. What if they are on social media with their friends. If they understand they must be accountable, they will start to straighten up. 

Oh wow. And after you were hostile, they are still bothering you. They probably thinks this is a full-out war. That's quite immature of them though. 

No need for that. A sweet email will be fine. Who knows, maybe they will take you out to lunch on your last day! 

There is not much you can do to address the situation, you are at their mercy. If you have many interviews lined up and many job offers you have the option to reject job offer from company with disrespectful interviewers. I've noticed rudeness occurs when they are doing "due diligence" of interviewing you because 

It sounds to me like you've got quite the predicament, and you are trying to hold to some unreasonable ideals. 

Explain to your children that self organizing and empowerment does not mean they get to do anything they want. If your team decided to go steal some automatic weapons and rob a bank, you aren't obliged to follow through with them just because they are empowered. They cannot "fire" you. That is the role of your manager. Firing always comes from up the chain, not from below. Sure, they can jump rungs in the hierarchy and work with your boss to remove you, but since apparently your boss and your bosses boss are both on leave without having put anyone in place in their absence, there's not much of a hierarchy to go to. You've got a few months. 

I agree with the other answer: No. However, I have a bit different of logic, because I tend to like answers that have more tangible roots than most social questions like this allow. Swear words, linguistically are rather interesting. They get used when you have no other words to describe what you need to express, but you feel obliged to express something anyway. So, if I was interviewing and heard a swear word, I would have to assume at least one of two things: 

I haven't had performance review in my career and it might seem odd but I feel danger, my manager is based in another city and we are in another. He is coming for our meeting. I know I had issues and i might get laid off today but do I get a chance to talk of why I am so slow or why I had trouble communicating or I do that in a appeal (If I am allowed to appeal the decision)? 

I have performance review and it is within my probation period. While I never had one before and generally I find many question regarding performance review after a 1 year in a job. I am curious to know what goes in the meeting and what are the the do and don'ts of discussing it in meeting despite your review going bad, good or worse. (Although I had been lagging behind my task) 

What you described here is a reasonable approach. It's always good to respect people, and having a default way to respect anyone is good. However, Mr. X has now asked you to call him by his first name. To decline to do so sends a funny message. It says "I respect everyone, and I do so by using honorifics. However, I will not respect you as an individual. Your individual preferences are not as important as my generic way of greeting all humans who have a pulse." It's not quite the message you want to send, is it? Try to call him by his first name. If it's hard for you to do because you've gotten in the habit of using honorifics, it's find to slip up and call him Mr. X by mistake. We're all human; he'll understand. But try, because that effort to treat him as an individual is true respect. A demonstration of effort goes a long way. 

There is a scholarship program for current employees in our company to go to graduate school. The Graduate school in question require letter of recommendation from supervisor via online. It's been more than 10 years I've been in University, and back then when I asked for letter of recommendations, the person would give hardcopy in sealed envelope. Now, Graduate school website says: 

I disagree. There are infinite ways one can always show they are adding value, build relationships. As long as there is a lot of work to do, a lot of things to innovate, then their is an ocean of such opportunity, one needs to ask themselves how else they can contribute. 

It probably made you look bad. They say pig likes to fight in mud, only difference is pig enjoys it. Pig is your coworkers in this case. 

Are these coworkers straight out of college? Perhaps college interns. Sometimes they behave that way because they don't understand real-world. Or they can just be annoying people 

All scientific evidence I have seen fails to demonstrate puzzles as effective. However, I believe they have some potential in non-scientific approaches. Consider that everything in the interview process is a tool. They're tools to help you and the company determine if they are good matches for each other (mostly to help the company, but it goes both ways). Accordingly, the interviewer uses any tools at their disposal. Some interviewers may find that asking a puzzle question is an effective tool in their toolbox to learn more about you, and then ask more pertinent questions. In such a scenario, I think puzzles are very useful. Its not the answer to the puzzle that matters, per se, but all of the subtle details surrounding it I would like to switch over to fiction for a moment, specifically Frank Herbert's Dune. Fiction is often in a good position to explore the extreme version of a situation, and sometimes that can make the less extreme version more clear. In Dune, one of the groups has something known as the "pain box," or "agony box." You put your hand in it, and it uses nerve induction to generate the most excruciating pain in the universe. It is part of a test to determine if you are sufficiently human to go forward with their "interview." It is explained that it is not the pain that matters, it is how the interviewer observes your reactions, and interacts with you while you feel your hand melting off. In the hands of someone who does not know how to use it, the box is useless as anything besides a torture device. However, in the hands of someone who knows how to use it to accomplish their goals, it peels away layers of defenses so that they can conduct the real portion of the interview without interference from shallow things like memorization or bravado. Now, after describing that interview, aren't you glad that they're really just asking you to solve a few puzzles? 

I am a Front end developer. I am sometimes assigned task that i do before time, therefore i ask my manager to check it. Is it a good idea to ask your Reporting Manager or Project Manager to have a look, making him jump off his seat to come and look at the work or it is better to do it and keep it aside while i do something that is good for me i.e study online or watch tutorial. In both cases i just don't want to sound bad, because when i call my manager to have a look, it remind me of time of school, when you use to call you teacher to ask you have done your work first. :P 

I have never given a noticed period so I am not sure how it is going to be, but my question are post notice period.Am I obliged to give an answer to the question if my manager asks things like what company you are going to or what package they are offering you, so we might know and offer you same? Am I obliged to answer those as notice period I am still under the contract and I to sound rude in other words burn all the bridges. 

I had similar situation (not as bad as yours). I set up plan for each day, and told each person what I expected from them. And I would check with them individually on a weekly basis. 

So far, I have my current supervisor, and past supervisor whom I can ask. How do I approach? Do I simply say, please register for this online system, or do I create an account and password for them, ask them to log in and change it. Is there anything else I should do Bottom Line: How to make it easy for supervisors past and present to provide letter of recommendation for this online format? 

Can you do self-learning on your free time? From there, you can show more of your knowledge, your employer can give more responsibilities, and eventually a raise. Maybe you can strategize eventually starting your own small business, i.e see Small Business Administration. I don't believe they do background checks. And it doesn't have to be in IT. See what else you are good at. This was a shot in the dark. Best wishes! 

Some talents are easy to capture in an interview. If you're interviewing to be a drafter, questions about your proficiency in AutoCAD (or a similar product) are quite reasonable and help quantify your ability to do the job. However, some talents (typically so called "soft skills") are much harder to test. Sometimes the interviewer wants to see what's underneath the veneer you put on when you entered the interview. Frankly, no matter what job you are interviewing for, you're going to be put into positions that put pressure on you. They can't test for those specific scenarios because they simply don't know what they will be. Each person's career pits them against different challenges. Instead they have to test for generic skills. One of the effective approaches for testing these skills is to ask questions that are outside of the "comfort zone," forcing you to dig deep. One famous question is from Google, asking about the resistance between two points on an infinite grid of 1 ohm resistors. This particular problem was very popular on the internet a while back as people looked for solutions to it. However, the purpose of the question was not to see who could get the right answer. It was to give an opportunity for the interviewer to see how you approached such problems. How did you structure your work? Did you get frustrated? All of these are very hard to quantify, and even harder to bake into one single numerical metric, but a skilled interviewer can glean a remarkable amount of information just by watching you operate in such a stressful environment. As for the task seeming to be "unrelated" to what you are interviewing for, it might indeed be unrelated. However, you may be surprised at how interrelated soft skills can be. As you work the job (assuming you get hired), you may learn to appreciate why that particular test was related. In an interview with an ex-Blue Man Group actor, I came across a similar interview test for clowns. The test was simple. The clown walked on stage in front of a group of people, said nothing, did nothing. They stood there. When they felt they had made meaningful contact with at least one person, they walked off stage. Given that clowns are almost never just standing still like that, the test might seem unrelated. However, if you dig deeper into the job and understand what a clown actually has to do to accomplish their job, that particular test was surprisingly relevant. Also, if you asked anyone to quantify the results of that test, they would chuckle at you and say "that's not how it works, pal." You can approach such a question may ways. You can jump into it with both feet, and belt out your best Sinatra, or maybe some Go Go's. Or decide not to let the question touch you at all and instead choose a nice rousing round of "Row Row Row your boat," while gathering yourself to answer the next question perfectly. Or perhaps you ask for clarification as to why you are being asked to sing. The ability to politely ask for clarification at the right moments is a highly prized skill in business. It's a skill that can save millions if applied at the correct moment. Any way you choose to treat it, the purpose of these curveball questions is to get to see a side of you that would not show past the thin veneer we put on when we go to an interview. It's a side that will get out if you get the opportunity to work 9-5 for several years with these people, so they might as well get to know what they're in for! Let them see what you will bring to the table after all those years. 

Next time you encounter this type of behavior you can POLITELY ask "how well do you think I fit for this position?" ... perhaps they will be attentive and/or give courtesy to end interview early. But don't discount disrespectful interviewers. I had this type of experience once and was STILL given job offer 

If numbers aren't required, don't use them. You may find quality more relevant that quantity. Resume should list 2 or 3 tasks (and percent of time spent on them. These must add to 100%) Under each task, you list sub-tasks such that it falls into 

Ask what have they done to solve the problem so far. Lot of times, people can troubleshoot their own problem and learn in the process. If your friend attempted to find a solution and was unsuccessful, then offer your time to help 

Your management is also at fault. They should understand that managing interns (interns, not seasoned employees who have seen the world) takes time and dedication. To re-iterate
