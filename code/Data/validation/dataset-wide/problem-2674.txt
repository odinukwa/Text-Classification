I don't think Aristotle's concerns were the same as, say, Kant in this regard; he does not (in my reading) appear to be referring to the "sensible/intelligible" distinction. Trivially, one could argue that although the subject matter of Euclid's proof is intelligible rather than sensible, one's learning it is most definitely a sensible process, and therefore the knowledge comes through an experience of a sort. 

It's more a problem of the rigorous definition of terms. I'd suggest you take a look at the Wikipedia article on Life which proposes a seven-step definition, and then continue reading the linked articles on each of the seven terms. This should get you started on the most common definition of life; you can then go on, if you wish, to explore alternative definitions (such as entropy-based or systems-based). 

I'm not sure if "anthropomorphising" is the correct word here; when referring to a cause and effect, we are not necessarily viewing this cause in human-like terms (although we certainly do that on occasion.) However, we are implying a relationship between the cause and the effect that we know (since Hume) may be really no more than a regularity. 

Here's a New York Times article on the notion; note that the term is not really used much in academic philosophy, but rather in conservative political ideology. 

The question is based upon an incorrect premise; mirrors do not flip left and right. Furthermore, this is a matter of physics (and optics), not philosophy. The philosophical portion of the question-- the intuition that all dimensions should be "treated equally", and that nature fails to do so-- follows from this incorrect assumption. 

Of course they do. What would it mean to make a claim completely devoid of evidence? Do you think there is any philosopher who claims that murder is wrong, or that a work of art is beatiful, for no particular reason? 

Actually, I doubt that this is true; it is very rare that one comes across a term that is completely devoid of meaning. I suspect that you mean that you come across terms that are ambiguous, or loosely defined. 

No fallacy; the reasoning is relatively sound, although the manner in which the issue is framed is a bit confused (from a traditional philosophical perspective.) Skepticism is generally used in an epistemological context, not in an ethical one. This is not necessarily a problem, since most ethical theories have some reliance on knowledge. For the purposes of this discussion, I think we can safely say that a non-relativist ethical system would have to be foundationalist; put another way, if we wish to avoid ethical relativism, we are required to have some privileged foundation for our ethics. So, the challenge then would be to come up with some kind of ethical foundation which would rise to the skeptical challenge. Naturally, if you side with the skeptics, this effort is going to come up short, and one is then left with some form of moral relativism. It is worth noting, of course, that "moral relativism" in this context does not mean "everyone is free to do what they want to", any more than skepticism means that we are completely without knowledge. 

For Nāgārjuna, śūnyatā is definitely equivalent to niḥsvabhāva (the lack of svabhāva.) And yes, this means that both beings and Being had no essence. Furthermore, śūnyatā is itself empty; we can't reify śūnyatā into some kind of meta-essence. So: the essence of all things is that they are essenceless. That's the paradox we live in. 

It's really not that hard. If you have an apple zero times, you have zero apples. You have no apples. The state of being appleless is really not terribly profound. 

No, it means that Kant's whole moral philosophy is imperfect. That's not a big shock; I don't think anybody (outside of Kant himself) actually thought that it was. I think that there are very few today who would doubt that humans are not perfectly rational, and that any attempt to ground an ethics in pure rationality is going to be incomplete at best. But that does not mean that Kant, or his moral writings, are worthless; on the contrary, they remain important works to grapple with in any later ethical developments. 

The argument fails on Proposition #1. "The language of physics is mathematics" is true only in the sense that mathematics is the language used by physicists to model the empirically observed effects measured in the physical world. This does not mean that all physical systems can necessarily be modeled mathematically, or that any set of mathematical formulas will completely describe the functioning of the physical world. EDIT: I fear I may not have made my point clearly enough, so let me try again. The relationship between mathematics and physics is approximately the same as the relationship between baseball statistics and baseball. (Substitute "cricket", or some other local sport if necessary.) We can say that baseball statistics is the language of baseball, and can expect that the formalisms of the statistics will form a coherent system (in that the numbers balance, and there are no conflicts or contradictions.) However, this system of statistics is not the equivalent of baseball. To think so is confusing the map for the territory. The "self-consistent whole" and "theory" in steps 3 and 4 is a map. No amount of further manipulation will teach us much about the territory we have not already explicitly put into the map. 

I suggest that you'll find that translations of Indian philosophy into European languages are spotty at best, and that this is not an exceptional case. 

I think that the question betrays a misunderstanding of rationalism; Descartes does not argue against the notion that "our knowledge of the world comes from our senses"-- he simply argues that some knowledge (regarding mathematics and logic, primarily) come through reason alone. So, answers to the question "To what extent does our knowledge derive from the senses?" are generally going to range from "A very large extent" to "Completely." Within this range, however, there are a very large number of different opinions-- a number which exceeds the number of epistemologists who have addressed the problem, as many of them have changed positions several times over the course of their work. If this problem interests you, I suggest you find an introductory textbook on epistemology; it will lay out the territory nicely. 

Nor would you have any need to do so. No one using a single-number measurement is expecting that number to be meaningful outside of context. Nor, for that matter, could any written text contain the instructions for how to read the language it is written in to be used by someone not already able to read that language. 

Wrong. You have experienced a small fraction of that potentially infinite time "behind you", but there is nothing stopping you from conceiving of, say, the year 1890, which (to all appearances) occurred without your presence. Of course, if you are a Buddhist, the year 1890 did include your presence, in some manner or another, but that's neither here nor there-- and that's precisely the flaw in the argument. Imaginary time is symmetrical, whether we imagine ourselves around to experience it or not. 

First: if one wishes to examine the writings of the known pre-Socratic philosophers, these have been widely published and are readily available. From these, it is difficult to find anything that Plato borrowed from anyone prior to Socrates. Next: if one wishes to look at the contemporary documentation of Plato's place in Greek philosophy, one must turn to Aristotle; this is the only significant source we have. Naturally, this is skewed by the fact that Aristotle was a student of Plato's. Then: if one wishes to take a broader historical view, one can turn to Diogenes Laertius, who remains the best (relatively) early historiographical source regarding Greek philosophy; however, he was writing many centuries after Plato, and although many of the sources he relied upon are now lost, we have no way of knowing how many other sources were lost before his time. And this takes us to our final, Rumsfeldian point: there's no way that we can possibly know how many philosophers or texts are lost to history-- we necessarily know only that which has survived. However, I would suggest that there's no particular reason to suspect that Athenian chauvanism was a major factor since many of the pre-Socratic philosophers that have come down to us are from other places (such as the Ionian school, or the Eleatic school, etc.) and these appear not to have been suppressed. 

I would suggest that you look at the literature on Gettier problems, as they would show why it is not always the case that 

As for the particular meanings of the various pseudonyms, and how they relate to each other and to Kierkegaard's own opinion: this is a matter of much scholarly discussion, and I don't think there is any solid consensus. I remember reading (in the late 1970s) a good article by Alastair McKinnon on the topic, but I imagine the field has shifted quite a bit since then. 

Well, that's trivially true-- but usually a number is used in a given context. For example, if we say "78 percent", we are describing a relationship-- that between 78 and 100. 

Not really. In fact, the entire discipline of phenomenology is predicated on the notion that one can bracket the distinction between a visual hallucination and a veridical act of seeing. Furthermore, ontology needs to deal with all kinds of entities that don't exist in the material world, so hallucinations are in no way unique. 

The position you describe is indeed the logical outcome of a Deist position, and does not only apply in monotheist situations; Epicurus founded his philosophy from a similar starting point, which can be summarized concisely in the Tetrapharmakos. I don't much care for the translation in the Wikipedia article, but it is enough to get you started. 

Yes; to the outside observer, it might appear that the Chinese room (or the computer equivalent) understands Chinese. If an investigator were given two teletypes, one of which goes to a trained Chinese translator, and one of which goes to the Chinese room (or its computer equivalent), there is no reliable way the investigator can tell the difference. In other words, they are functionally equivalent to the observer. However: as shown above, our intuition tells us that they are actually very different, and that understanding Chinese is very different than the mechanical simulation of understanding Chinese. 

I wish you luck with this, but I think you're going to find the gap between physics and metaphysics to be unbridgeable. Absolute Truth is not the domain of physics. That being said: from a philosophical perspective, to exist is reducible to possessing causal efficacy; in other words, for something to be said to exist, it needs to be capable of having some kind of detectable effect on something else. So, the question for a physicist would then be: is it possible for something to possess causal efficacy without having mass or energy? I don't see how this would be possible, but I'm not a physicist. So, I suspect that the answer to your question (Does the philosophical foundation of physics imply that existence is contingent upon the "posession" of mass/energy?) is "Yes"-- but I stand prepared to be corrected by a physicist. 

You've made a hasty generalization; everything is not opinion. More specifically, perception is not opinion-- I cannot eat a lemon and decide that it tastes sweet, nor look at it and decide that it is purple, and I can't smell a foul odor and decide that it smells pleasant. 

I think that one can find a rational justification for the position, if one is willing to accept certain basic principles. Let us start from the standpoint of Kant's second formulation of the Categorical Imperative (from the Groundwork of a Metaphysics of Morals) which reads: Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end. Let us then take the position that all sentient beings, by virtue of being capable of suffering are entitled to the same moral protections as humans (but not necessarily the same moral obligations). From the combination of these two positions, it follows that to eat an animal (or use an animal product in any direct form) consists of treating said animal as a means to an end, and not as an end in itself. Now, obviously, both of the premises of the above syllogism are open to debate, and I'm not particularly motivated to try to defend either of these premises from the variety of criticism they may be open to; but I don't think there is anything about these positions that puts them beyond the pale of reason.
