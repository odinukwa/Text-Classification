Maybe I'm reading too far in to your question, but for me, this doesn't stop at "worry or don't worry." After all, worry either makes us sick, or motivates us to change. So, instead, consider the potential ways this could motivate your behaviors: 

You should get the picture by now. The way you counter this, as @Daniel indicated, is to redirect to - you guessed it - a discussion about your skill set and your contribution to the company. To circle back to your specific question, you asked: 

I think you need to step away from analyzing the interview and worrying about what he thought of you in the interview. That's history now. Also, give up on comparing yourself to other interns. There's a reasonable expectation that different people will get different assignments and respond to them at different levels of capability. Your internship is yours, not theirs. Focus on two things: 

Focus on your own improvement and your own workload, and work with your boss to address your coworker's impact on you, versus trying to fix your coworker. 

I think the answer to this question depends on your long term plans, and those of the employer you're interested in. Checking in once every 3-4 months implies that either: 1) You've found another job but are willing to jump ship at a moment's notice, or 2) You've been unemployed for months at a time. Depending on the industry and employer, these may both be incredibly bad signs, or they may not be a big deal at all. Checking in like that also implies that you aren't aware of, or are too lazy to check, the channels the employer uses to hire. Do they have external job postings on their website? Do they use a recruiting service? Are you aware of those channels and are you keeping track of them? Or are you expecting that this contact of yours is going to do that legwork for you? If you DO check back in, I would only do so with purpose. Don't check in unless you have something meaningful to say and keep it brief. You mentioned outside research - perhaps you could provide some info on that, offer to share what you've been doing, or even ask for feedback on it (assuming that was appropriate in your culture/industry). This is where professional social networking tools can be handy. It's easy to stay in someone's peripheral vision on Linkedin or similar sites without being a pain in their side. I try to maintain a moderate level of activity on Linkedin with respect to my professional interests - liking or commenting on articles, posting things I find relevant, etc - maybe a few times a month. Doing so keeps your name in someone's feed, without the need to stalk them or pester them with emails, and it gives them a (passive) way to know what you're up to. I feel like this is as much a question about professional networking as it is a question about recruiter/employee relationships - and when it comes to networking, you have to make sure you're offering something as much as asking something. No one wants to network with someone who is asking for something but has nothing of value to say or offer in return. 

It's worth noting that Open Source doesn't mean "isn't real." It doesn't even mean "has no economic impact." Lots of open source projects have plenty of "real" implications in terms of powering millions of dollars of economic activity and impacting every day lives. The good news is, you can get involved in this massive engine and make a difference, without first having to get hired by a specific employer. So - don't look at it as "not real" or "low risk" - instead, look at it as a learning opportunity and the chance to make a difference, outside of your paycheck. 

@user had a great suggestion in comments on another answer. To paraphrase: Be honest, but also be ready to turn a bad situation into something positive. Besides the basic value of honesty, employers really like candidates who can turn a challenge into a growing experience - or who can learn from failure - rather than employees who don't bother to try to understand challenges and just move on to something else. You don't need to have a pages-long monologue prepared, but it makes sense to have two or three specific, brief "stories" ready in your head - a few sentences each - where you can describe a factor that challenged you in your past employer and why that helped you grow (looking for a new job somewhere else is a type of growing). Then, when you get asked the question of, "why did you leave?" you can give a general high level summary, and add one of your stories. If they probe further, you've got some backup material ready with your other stories, too. At the risk of putting words in your mouth, let's look at the last sentence of your first paragraph and rephrase it to fit this approach: 

Specifically separating out problems with your own workload (caused by your coworker) will allow you to focus on things you have control over, and things you are personally responsible for. It may seem like a subtle difference, but saying "I'm unexpectedly spending time fixing issues with other people's code" is very different from saying "my coworker writes poor code." The first is a problem your boss can help you solve or at least understand (in terms of explaining your priorities), the second is just a complaint. Your boss may already be aware of and working on your coworker's code issues, and he/she needs to be the one making the decisions about whether or not you're involved in fixing the issues (while he presumably works with the coworker on an improvement plan). Him browsing popular websites or having issues with his work quality may be worth mentioning to your boss, but you can't expect to take responsibility for that and you can't expect to correct it yourself. That's the boss's job. A hard lesson to learn is to be able to do good work yourself, even if you're on a team with people who don't pull their own weight. 

Chances are, if a product is big/important/well established enough to be known widely in the industry, then it'll be generally accepted that it has been created as a team effort by many people over a long period of time. In other words, if you claim to have developed a component in Microsoft Word, no one is going to hold you personally responsible for the public's opinion of Microsoft Word. That said, specific product names are probably less important than explaining the overall scenario. Again, focus on yourself. Instead of naming specific branded products, describe the problem as you did here - that you were able to add a feature from one product onto another product. Think about what made you successful as you did that and describe those factors, rather than just focusing on naming or not naming the product, or the public's opinion about the product you worked on. 

My point is this: Don't get hung up on his arguments because they don't matter. You should not accept a salary because that's what your coworker's make. You should accept the salary because YOU think it's fair for YOUR contribution to the company. If you continue to get nowhere, you need to face the facts - one of the following is true:
