As I understand it, in the original bible passage, Jesus says to Peter "And I tell you that you are Petros, and on this petra I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it" And in the original Aramaic, the word used is also a noun which translates as "Rock" or "Stone". According to wikipedia Petros had not previously been used as a name, but in the Greek-speaking world it became a popular Christian name, after the tradition of Peter's prominence in the early Christian church had been established. In many Latin languages, Petros is rendered as a the word for rock/stone in that language. For example, French Pierre is both the name of the saint and a word for stone. In others, the gender changes (a rock is female and inflects at the end differently to the male name) but the relationship between the words is transparent. So how did stone come to be rendered in English as the opaque Peter when referring to person, Peter. It's obviously a cognate with the greek and latin words, but how did it enter the language and end up with its current spelling and pronunciation? My best guess is that is travelled as a given name across the channel before the bible was commonly read in English, as an Anglicised form of the Romance language name, and when the Bible was translated, it made sense to the translators to use the existing English name. But this is just my guess. 

Some other examples are the Mongolian, and Buryat languages, which use 2 systems for day of week names, one based on the planets and one based on ordinal numbers. In Mongolia 

However "thì" may not be used very often, instead they are dropped completely, for example "cái bánh này ngọt" - the cake is sweet, or "trời lạnh" - it's cold, esp. when going with exclamation words like "em đẹp lắm" - you're so beautiful! 

I don't think there's an alphabet without names for the characters because if there wasn't, how can they spell the words? In certain circumstances spelling is neccessary. Even logographic scripts like Chinese have "names" for the strokes and "names"/pronunciations for the radicals. The strangest I've ever seen is the character ん/ン(n) in Japanese. To spell it we only produce a nasal sound inside the throat without a vowel because in Japanese that character represents the coda and is the only one that cannot produce a complete syllable alone. So IMO it's hardly called a "pronounceable name" although we can still spell the words. 

Please find the traditional Mongolian texts as well as more information in the link since it's hard to paste the vertical texts here without breaking the layout You can also read about the names of week in different languages here: Days of the Week in the West, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Mongolian 

In Vietnamese I don't think there's a direct equivalent of to be in English, but there are some words to describe the meanings like @bytebuster said: 

While in English Romance languages and Germanic languages, the rendering of fractions usually corresponds to that of the ordinal numbers, i.e a fifth, and a sixth, a seventh, etc. ; it seems to me that conceptually, they are are a different entity. To highlight this, in Germanic and Romance languages there seem to be a few exceptions peppered in the lower numbers: English ½= a half 2nd = second , ¼= quarter vs. 4th= fourth. Spanish: ⅓ = um tercio 3º = tercero . All the texts I've read refer to the set of "half, third, quarter, fifth..." etc. as the "ordinal numbers" of a language. However, it seems to me they are a separate conceptual entity (innately; but also as demonstrated by the presence of the exceptions). Is there a linguistic term for the set of these words in a language? Are there any examples of languages which have a set of words (more than 2 or 3) for fractions that are different from both the ordinal number (e.g. "one third") or the cardinal (e.g. "one over three") numbers. 

These answers deal with the parts of our thoughts that take place in language, and yes, that is largely context dependent, as others have outlined. That is to say, if you're thinking about best way is to phrase something, or trying to understand a specific sentence you've just heard, then you'll think in the language you're thinking about. However, it's important to note that cognitive science shows us that most of our thoughts don't take part in any language at all. In fact, strictly speaking, thought precedes language. Generally the only time we think in language at all is is when we are thinking about language, thinking specifically about talking to people, or for some other reason we are deliberately putting our thoughts into words. Language is essentially a medium to express our thoughts, not the medium in which we think. So if I'm trying to decide what I'm going to say to my boss when I call up and phone in sick, I'll think about the words in whatever language I'm planning to speak to her. But, if I'm thinking about what I'm going to do with my sick day, planning what I'm going to have for dinner, thinking about how I feel about a particular person or thing, or remembering something I did the previous day; none of that takes place "in a language". There are various studies in cognitive science that bear this out, as well as (less scientific but useful to understanding) observations about day to day life. For example, after we hear a speech or a lecture, we remember the concepts but rarely the exact wording; these are recorded in a "raw" "language free" format. That is to say, unless a specific wording of a sentence jumps out at us for its poetic or aesthetic value, our brains don't remember a single individual sentence what we've just heard, and yet we retain the content. Now that's not to say that we can't memorise individual sentences word for word; we often choose to do this, and if a specific figure of speech jumps out at us as interesting then we might make a mental note of it word for word; but that doesn't mean we think in language any more than remembering the hook of a pop song means that we think in melody. Similarly, people who mutually speak more that one language with each other regularly often can't even remember in what language a specific conversation took place, but can remember the content. I can't remember the specific study, but I once read one where polyglots were given a short piece of text and then asked afterwards to say what it said. They took the same amount of time to do so regardless of whether they were summarising in the same language or a different language as the original; which showed that they weren't mentally "translating", just relaying the information they had absorbed, showing that information isn't coded in a specific language. For more on this I suggest you look into Steven Pinker, he's got some great freely available lectures on the subject online. 

I think it all depends on how you define "near" future. To make things concrete, we have a very large corpus of spoken English from Philadelphia, where dates-of-birth of our speakers range from 1888 to 1991. Looking at the historical trends across 100 years, I'd feel comfortable making predictions about how the language will look in 3 to 4 years from now, but I think what things will look like 10 to 15 years from now is totally up in the air. For instance, in the 1970s, it was reported that the vowel /aw/ (as in house and down) was fronting and raising. This fronting and raising pattern looks pretty robust in data collected all the way through the 1980s, into the early 1990s. If you had asked me in 1995 what /aw/ would sound like in 2020, the best guess I could have made based on the available data would be that it would continue shooting up to be something like [iw]. However, starting in the mid 1990s, the data starts to turn around, and it looks like /aw/ is taking a nosedive towards a lower, backer pronunciation. As such, I'd guess that in 2015, /aw/ is going to be a little lower and backer than it is now, but I don't want to bet any money on what'll be going on in 2030. 

Morphologically triggered stem changes could also be a good example. For instance in sang, the phonological process indicates the past tense, and is pronounced simultaneously as the lexical material indicating the verb "to sing." 

In Vietnamese songs the tones will generally follow the melodies. Of course sometimes there still be some odd, out-of-tone sounds but most of it is a product of an amateur musician. As André Müller said in this answer: 

The sound /ð/ doesn't exist in Vietnamese. And d in Vietnamese doesn't represent any of the D-like sound as you expected. The d sound in Vietnamese is /ɗ/ which is a voiced alveolar implosive and written by the character Đ/đ In Northern Vietnamese the letter d represents the phoneme /z/ which is no way similar to /j/1. However in the remaining dialects of Vietnamese d still represents the phoneme /j/, so there's no difference from Chinese. 1Note that /y/ is the sound of u in French or German ü, not the sound of y 

However, albeit the name, it should be noted that in Vietnam Monday is the start of week, and there is a song about that which everyone should learn from kindergarten, too. It was said that this possibly originated from Portuguese when the Portuguese Jesuit missionaries came to Vietnam and created an alphabet based on Latin characters for Vietnamese. 

an object x is a part of set X: là, e.g. "đây là quả táo" (this is an apple); an object x has property of y: thì, e.g. "cái hộp thì đỏ" (the box is red) located at: ở, e.g. "tôi đang ở văn phòng" (I am at the office); to mean, e.g. yêu là chết trong lòng một ít (a sentence in the famoust poem by Xuân Diệu) which can roughly be translated as "to love is to die a little bit in the heart";
