Along with to what has already been said, the bike is less than ideal, but you now have purchased it and it can be used, probably quite successfully. For a 40 day tour with that bike I would consider replacing the front fork and/or bars with a touring fork and butterfly bars - although your budget, biking experience and tolerance for less than perfect fit may mean you wish to leave it as is. The new fork solves the front rack mounting problem and removes the suspension (a disadvantage when touring) and will reduce weight. Swapping the fork and keeping the same bars is an easy 30 minute job. You would need a fork with the correct steerer (looks like a straight 1/18th) and would need the correct axle to steerer length so as not to throw out the bikes geometry. it would also need disk mounts and the same axle as your wheel (or a new wheel). Steel would be my material of choice. Butterfly bars gives you more hand positions choices than a flat bar, and come in sizes that allows you to keep the MTB shifters and brake levers. Swapping bars is a bit more work, but still reasonably straight forward. I would also consider throwing on an adjustable stem to allow simple bar height adjustment. An easier (and cheaper) alternate to swapping to butterfly bars would be bar end extensions and maybe an aerobar of some sort. Personally I do not like extension on a MTB due to increased risk of injury in a crash, but for touring, they provide another hand position. Again, an adjustable stem could be a worth while investment. 

I had one of these. With the exception of the narrow brush (which can be bought seperately), whos curved, toothed end is wonderful for cleaning gunk out of cassettes, I found the tool a waste of money. I wound up throwing mine away. If you're seeing a lot of grime, your problem is almost certainly not the conditions in your area, although this can exacerbate the problem. Rather, you probably leaving too much oil on your chain/drivetrain. The following will work better than the Park cleaner, save you money, and reduce your environmental impact. Equipment needed 

In my experience, which is sadly rather high, bike thieves tend to look for shiny, and easy targets of opportunity. Camouflaging your bike as a beater will cause most to simply scan right over it. Incidentally, the following happened to my roommate in Paris, with a brand new $3K mountain bike: He pulled up to a fixture of some sort, leaned his bike against the fixture, and started fishing around in his bag for a lock. Whilst doing so, a thief road up on a beater bike, sprung off said beater, sprung on roommates fancy pride and joy, and road off while my roommate looked on in shock and horror. Probably wouldn't have happened if his bike looked like a beater. A further tip is to look for a good locking place -- somewhere with nice bikes on parade, in view of gendarmarie, or in view of many cyclists (where a thief might suppose you are among said cyclists) are good choices, as is underneath a security camera, such as those typically found in car parks. Finally, workplaces often have a sheltered area where you can lock your bike in relative safety. Last but not least, you can leave the QR for your bike seat, and take the seat with you when you are leaving the bike for an extended time. This tends to be quite discouraging as it both makes your bike look like an abandoned beater, and makes riding off on your bike uncomfortable. 

A quick Google search of "Andriod cycling apps" will give a a thousand apps, 500 reviews and 100 "best for cycling" lists. Anything in the top 20 of any of the lists will do that is being asked. So the real question is which ones "save energy" - I presume you mean use the least amount of battery power. The problem with this approach is really down to relying on GPS, and the nature of cell phone screens, which both large amounts of power. A normal phone can get 4-8hours life with GPS on, and the back light needed to run the display reduces it to a few hours at most. The amount of power the application uses is insignificant compared to the above two, so to all practical purposes, any app that meets your requirements will use the same amount of power. Unfortunately, because of these battery life limitations amoung other things, cell phones are not idea bike computers, which is why there is still a huge market for dedicated bike computers. If you want to get the cell phone to last as long as possible, you need an app hat will turn the screen of and leave the screen off unless you explicitly look at it. If you really want real time data you can see at any time without pressing buttons, a $20 wired cycle computer is still the most reliable and cheapest way to get it. As far as applications, I currently us iCardio on my andriod phone and find it does everything I want and more. I won't recommend it over others, as I haven't used anything else for years. 

Regular maintenance I do this once a week, or daily when riding in inclement weather. That's pretty frequent, but the more frequently you do it, the quicker and easier it goes. You can experiment with frequency depending on your riding conditions, but you should find this is all the drivetrain maintenance you need until you chain wears out, with the gunk-cleaning being a special case. 

clipless pedals : buck for buck experience tells me this is your biggest win. It makes a big difference in power transfer. frame stiffness: while bike weight (unless your talking >1kg) isn't going to make much difference, a stiff frame which allows for efficient power transfer will. Changing your bike doesn't seem to be an option for you, but adjusting your seating position and height so you get most effective oomph from your pedalling is worth trying. Aerodynamics makes a big difference for a strong headwind, or at higher speeds. So drop bars, a longer stem, or possibly bar ends could help you out here. Rolling resistance can be a big factor too, and this is a cheap one to improve -- get kevlar bead, high pressure tires with a slick surface (if your current tires have a degree of knobbyness to them, you'll notice a big difference here). Light tires make a much bigger difference than frame weight because of rotational momentum. 

I also strongly recommend a chain-checker -- a simple little tool for checking chain wear, but you can always just run by your shop periodically to have them check it, if that's convenient. Cleaning a gunky drivetrain I say drivetrain, because it's usually not just your chain that's gunky, the casset, chainrings, and especially derailleur typically get really gunky too. If you're keeping your chainring lightly oiled (defined below) you won't have to do this too often -- after a really muddy ride for example 

You may not need to get a professional bike fit to fix the problem, and the problem may not be fixed by a correct bike fit. If you do not know what the fitter is doing, be prepared to spend $200 for not much improvement. The comment by @Neil "Research bike fit yourself and adjust your bike accordingly. It won't be as good as a pro fitting, but it's definitely better than nothing." Has to be the best advise given to this question. Even if you get a less than ideal bike fit doing it yourself, making even small changes can result in significant improvement. By understanding even a little of the dynamics, you should be able to get a fit that is comfortable, even if not 100% efficient - you may even get it spot on. One advantage of reading up on bike fits is should you end up going to a professional fitter, he will be working with someone who at least has a basic understanding of the problems and compromises, and you will be able to ask intelligent questions and give more accurate feedback. You will be able to more accurately explain the compromises you want (e.g. Setting up for a time trial is not the same as a touring would be, road is somewhere in the middle). For this reason alone, I do not recommend going to a fitter without having a basic understanding of what he will do and a clear understanding of what is important to you.
