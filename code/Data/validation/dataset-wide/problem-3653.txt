If all trunk-flexing exercises are out, I think you need to ask McGill what's left. He seems to recommend a modified lumbar-spine-neutral crunch called the "curl-up" alongside the bird-dog and side plank:

Lifting fast will make you stronger, but strength is not hypertrophy. However, strength will help you increase volume, and volume is one of the primary causes of muscle growth. For more on volume's relation to hypertrophy I recommend Strengtheory's article on volume, which has plenty of references. The bottom line there is that hypertrophy is largely determined by the number of challenging (read: to failure or near-failure) sets. My recommendation for someone doing a 5x5 with the goal of hypertrophy is to do the reps relatively fast. It's even recommended for strength gains to be explosive, even on "slow" lifts like the squat. This helps with recruiting fast-twitch muscle fibers. As to the time between reps within a set, I'd recommend not referring to this as "rest", since that confuses the issue with actual rest periods between sets. It also doesn't reflect how that time should feel: if standing with the bar on your shoulders during a squat set is easy, you're not squatting enough. It should be slightly taxing. But time-between-reps-within-a-set should be between half a breath and a few breaths. For something like squats or presses, where you're bearing the weight between reps, it's really up to you regardless: if you're doing a 20-rep squat set and want to take ten breaths between rep 18 and 19 (and you should!), then go ahead. It doesn't make rep 19 any easier or less effective. For exercises where you're not bearing the weight, try to keep that time minimal, within the context of "a few breaths". For example, if between deadlift reps you take five breaths at the bottom, then it's not really a single set anymore because you're taking true rest. 

You're making up excuses while sitting around instead of wrestling and testing your ideas. Yes, bigger people are sometimes harder to wrestle. Sometimes. Often a big fat person who doesn't train is easier to wrestle because they're unathletic, weak, slow, and ignorant of technique. They can fix that by training--either getting stronger and staying the same size, or by losing weight, or by learning to wrestle. 

Make sure you use the full range of motion in each exercise, keep your back straight for everything, learn good form, and lift heavy. If you need more conditioning work, run, using both sprints and distances up to 5k. I'd do some bodyweight work (read: dips and pull-ups) to round out the training. 

You might be able to just adjust your form and keep your current weight, but in order to be sure that you don't accidentally jump much closer to your 1RM, I'd drop to 95 pounds and restart the progression on bent-over rows. Taking twenty pounds off should be plenty to make sure you can do the exercise with corrected form. It's also not a huge drop in weight in absolute terms. Disclaimer: I haven't done bent-over rows in years, and only got about as far as you are now. This advice is based on the other pressing and pulling I do, in which I am merely a beginner. 

I'm not convinced that people "hate" it. I think what you're seeing is probably exasperation with how popular the machine is in disproportion to its usefulness. 

Volume If you can do two or three sets of about 6 chin-ups, I'd focus on volume rather than any particular set or rep scheme. That's because it's hard to stick to any particular number of reps per set with chin-ups in general, and especially so when the trainee can do less than 10 in a set. (Increased but tolerable volume is frequently the goal when deloading and working back up or altering rep ranges when this problem is encountered with barbell exercises.) Instead of doing sets of six with kipping, I'd focus on getting 25 strict chin-ups in every workout (or even every day, or every weekday). That might mean a set of six, then four, then two sets of three, then four sets of two, then one. Don't worry about the number of reps being consistent across sets. Other tools Negatives are an enormously productive way to increase chin-up numbers as well. Maybe make your last two or five sets all negatives, where you jump to the top and lower yourself as slowly as possible. This allows you to dramatically increase the pull-up volume you can achieve, and it does so in a more productive manner (for strength and pull-up performance) than kipping. Holds are very useful as well. When my maximum pull-up number is low, or when my elbow is inflamed, I'll alternate workouts with an A and B system. On A workout days, my pull-up workout is as described above, with no negatives or holds, just focusing on volume and maximum number of reps per set. On B days, I pick a number of reps I know I can do reliably. (This is often quite low.) I do three to six sets of that many reps, as negatives, each performed with a hold at the beginning (at the top) and end (at the bottom) of the set. Sometimes I'll do holds between every rep. This slow, low-volume approach gives me plenty of training stimulus for the movement while avoiding the high-stakes intensity of going for a maximum number of reps in each set. 

When you're doing a novice progression, a 2-week break can set you way, way back. I think you should be working at around 175. Don't try 205 again without working your way back up. That said, there are some things. Your first squat rep was a tad high but the rest were okay. Good job! Yes, it's weird for your deadlift to be so low compared to your squat. Why might that be? Well, your setup for the deadlift is simply not correct. 

It depends what kind of stretching you're doing, and what kind of stretching program you're on. I recommend buying Stretching Scientifically by Tom Kurz and reading about the topic in detail. 

Since you can do 5 to 7 pull-ups and your goal is muscle-ups, I'd focus on high-rep sets in every workout. Three sets of 8 is OK, but I've found that pull-ups respond very well to volume. Five sets of 8 on "pull" days, plus 3 sets of 8 on "push" and "leg" days would be a start. So would greasing the groove with sets of 2 or 3 all throughout the day, if you have access to a pull-up bar at home or work. Another method that's worked for me is to pick a target total number of reps--50 would be a good choice for your situation--and try to hit that every day (or every workout day) in as few sets as possible. Don't fry yourself on your first set, don't exert yourself to failure, but just push yourself to get a lot of reps in each set and to keep adding sets until you hit 50 total. This approach worked for me when "3 sets to failure" stopped helping. As for transitioning to muscle-ups, you should be training on rings at least some of the time, incorporating dips into your regimen, and trying out a false grip. When working on a bar, changing your grips and switching to chin-ups at least part of the time can help with muscle-up prep. 

Without those three basic physical qualities--strength, power, conditioning--the reaction time of the less genetically gifted will always be lacking, because they find themselves unable to apply their sport-specific skills due to weakness, slowness, or fatigue. Once you have those bases covered in your training regimen, sport-specific agility drills will be much more helpful and highly recommended. 

So though not an exact match, 36 is pretty close to 40, and 54 is pretty close to 60, and 74 is pretty close to 80. So hey!--it looks like being "lazy" with the plates worked out. However, yes, this does mean that there are thresholds where I have to decide whether I'm going to add A Whole New Warm-Up Set. A week or so ago I had to decide to add a ~185 set, because I had been jumping from ~135 to the low 200s without an intermediate step. Worry? If a trainee is struggling with their max sets, and is also on the threshold where they should be adding an additional warm-up set, caution may be warranted. This is where the SS method may best mine: by keeping the number of warm-up sets constant, one avoids major disruptions to what really matters, that is, your work sets. While on Starting Strength, the goal is to maximize the success and progress of your work sets. One hears cries of Work Sets Uber Alles! and Linear progression will rescue you from the depths of weakness! and so on. That's a valid approach. If that's your method--and I've had success with it--I'd hew close to the prescribed warm-up percentages, take the increases in weight in stride, and don't worry too much about adding 5 pounds to your warm-up sets. It won't matter much. However, I've also had success with making sure that my warm-up sets involve a little volume too. That's why I use my "add the plates that are easiest to add" method. This ensures that I get practice with the lift, and that I get plenty of training volume in even if I burn out on my work sets, or if the work sets have low volume (such as when I do high-intensity doubles or triples).Â  It's your call. But I wouldn't fret about the difference between warming up with 150 and 155. For instance, in the following scenario with a work weight of 205#: 

The Olympic lifts are great for practicing and generating powerful, explosive legs. The snatch and clean (and their power variants) are the most explosive training movement and should be the focus of your training for explosiveness. However, one should not solely work the Olympic lifts. Supporting lifts like the back and front squat, regular and Romanian deadlift, overhead press and push press are all necessary scaffolding for a successful and healthy Olympic lifting regimen. Make sure you start with a base of strength and mobility before challenging your body with heavy cleans or snatches. One should also include jumps for height and distance (box jumps and broad jumps), using either one or both feet at a time.
