I am not sure what exactly is meant by a repeated structure but at least some covering graphs should qualify. Covering graphs may be quite large, however they admit concise description via voltage graphs. The edges of a small base graph or voltage graph are equipped with group elements, called voltages. For instance, an n x n tessellation of a torus can be described by a single vertex with two loops and group elements (0,1) and (1,0) taken from the group $Z_n \times Z_n$ assigned to the loops. Of course most graphs admit no compression in this way. 

I am aware of recent book "Configurations of Points and Lines" by Branko Grunbaum, the book by Juergen Bokowski: "Computational Oriented Matroids" and the book "Computational Synthetic Geometry" by Bokowski and Sturmfels. I am not sure if any of them gives the final answer to this problem. 

Cycle vs Even cycle. Most questions about cycles in graphs have analogs in even cycles for bipartite graphs. For instance, it is trivial to show that a bipartite graph on an odd number of vertices cannot have a Hamilton cycle. In such a case the bipartite analog of a Hamilton cycle is a cycle missing exactly one vertex. Minimal Girth. For graphs, 3 is the minimal possible length of a cycle. For bipartite graphs, the analogous number is 4. Triangular vs quadrangular embeddings. In topological graph theory, a triangular embedding of a simple graph determine its genus. For bipartite graphs, the analog is an embedding with quadrangles as faces. 

In "continuous" mathematics there are several important notions such as covering space, fibre bundle, Morse theory, simplicial complex, differential equation, real numbers, real projective plane, etc. that have a "discrete" analog: covering graph, graph bundle, discrete Morse theory, abstract simplicial complex, difference equation, finite field, finite projective plane, etc. I would like to know if there are others. But the real question is: Are there any important "continuous" mathematical concepts without "discrete" analog and vice versa? 

If two graphs have a common cover, then they have a common universal cover. The "maximal" cover is therefore unique. In general, the reverse is not true. The "minimal" common cover may not be unique. This was shown by Wilfried Imrich and me. See also European Journal of Combinatorics Volume 29, Issue 5, July 2008, Pages 1116-1122 

I removed the actual journal title and other details since they are not important for this question. I would like to have some general criteria or guidelines that would help me decide whether to accept such an offer or not. 

The fist part of your question has a negative answer, since both Fano plane (73) and Moebius-Kantor configuration (83) are cyclic configurations. Here it is shown that the cyclic covering graphs over a dipole with girth at least 6 are exactly Levi graphs of combinatorial cyclic configurations. In your terminology, each Levi graph of a cyclic configuration has a "voltage-graph representation". Note: a dipole is a graph consisting of two vertices and a number of parallel edges between them. In particular both the Heawood graph and the Moebius-Kantor graph are counterexaples. If v = uw is a composite number, it is sometimes possible to find a suitable voltage graph on 2u vertices and voltages from the cyclic group Zw to produce a straight-line drawing of the corresponding polycyclic configuration (v3). Unfortunately this method does not apply to cyclic configurations (vk), for v prime and is not certainly not understood well for k > 4. I am not sure what happens if pseudolines are admitted in such drawings having rotational symmetry. 

I do not think that edge-coloring is necessarily less interesting than vertex-coloring. I work in neither but have used both in my research. I have a feeling that vertex-coloring may be perceived as more important in general graph theory, where the object of the study are graphs not necessarily with some particular structure and colorings are closely related to graph morphisms. Vertex color classes are independent sets, while edge-color classes are matchings. I found both concepts very useful. However if the coloring is considered as part of the structure, it is hard to tell which concept is more popular. For instance, incidence geometries may be viewed as graphs with a given vertex-coloring. On the other hand, say, a Cayley graph is a graph that carries a natural edge-coloring structure. 

Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold where closed balls are compact. Let $W\subset M$ be a submanifold of $M$ that is closed as a subset of $M$. Define the cut locus of $W$ in $M$ as $$\mathrm{Cut}(W;M)=\overline{\{x\in M\mid \exists y,z\in W,\text{with $y\neq z$ and } d(x,W) = d(x,y) = d(x,z)\}}$$ where the line denotes "closure". 

Let $U$ and $V$ be open subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ and let $\mathrm{OEmb}(U,V)$ denote the space of open embeddings of $U$ into $V$ with the compact-opent topology. Let $\bar{U},\bar{V}$ denote their one-point compactifications and let $\mathrm{map}(\bar{V},\bar{U})$ denote the space of maps between them again with the compact-open topology. There is a (set-theoretic) map $$\mathrm{OEmb}(U,V)\longrightarrow \mathrm{map}(\bar{V},\bar{U})$$ that sends an embedding $e$ to the map $\phi(e)$ given by $\phi(e)(y) = e^{-1}(y)$ if this value exists and $\phi(e)(y)=\infty$ otherwise. Fact: This map is continuous. More generally, it is also continuous if $U$ and $V$ are Hausdorff locally compact locally connected topological spaces. What reference should I cite for these facts? 

I haven't found an explicit reference in the literature, but as Johannes Ebert pointed to me, in the second part of Theorem 4 of R. Arens, Topologies for Homeomorphism Groups, American Journal of Mathematics, Vol. 68, No. 4 (Oct., 1946), pp. 593-610 it is proven that the inverse mapping $\mathrm{Homeo}(X)\to \mathrm{Homeo}(X)$ that sends a homeomorphism to its inverse is continuous with respect to the compact-open topology, provided that $X$ is Hausdorff, locally compact and locally connected. The same proof works as well to prove my question (under the assumptions that $X$ and $Y$ are Hausdorff, locally compact, and $Y$ is locally connected). Therefore I think that Arens article is a good reference for this fact (together with an indication saying that the proof has to be mildly adpated). This is how the adaptation would go: Theorem: If $X$ and $Y$ are Hausdorff locally compact spaces and $Y$ is locally connected, then the collapsing map $$\phi\colon \mathrm{OEmb}(X,Y)\longrightarrow \mathrm{map}(\overline{Y},\overline{X})$$ is continuous with the compact-open topologies. Proof: Take an embedding $e$ and consider a subbasic neighbourhood $(K,U)$ of $\phi(e)$, where $K\subset \overline{Y}$ is compact and $U\subset \overline{X}$ is open. Let us denote by $U^c$ the complement of $U$ in $X$ (not in $\overline{X}$). An embedding $f$ belongs to this neighbourhood if $\phi(e)(K)\subset U$, and this holds if and only if $e(U^c)\subset K^c$. Therefore $e(U^c)\subset K^c$ and if any other embedding $f$ satisfies that $f(U^c)\subset K^c$, then it holds that $\phi(f)\in (K,U)$. We distinguish two cases: \underline{If $\infty\in U$}, then $U^c$ is compact and we are done ($(U^c,K^c)$ is an open neighbourhood of $e$ that gets mapped into the neighbourhood $(K,U)$ of $\phi(e)$. \underline{If $\infty\notin U$}, then $K\subset e(X)$, and therefore $e^{-1}(K)$ is compact. This is the situation that Arens handles. We use that $X$ is Hausdorff locally compact to construct a pair of open neighbourhoods $V,W$ of $K$ with compact closure of $e$ such that $$e^{-1}(K)\in V\subset \overline{V}\subset W\subset \overline{W}\subset U.$$ Then $N:=\overline{W}\setminus V$ is compact, and if $f\in (N,K^c)$, then $\phi(f)(K)\subset N^c$. Observe that $N^c$ is the disjoint union of $V$ and $\overline{W}^c$. Now we use that $X$ is locally connected to assume, without loss of generality that $K$ is connected (this is detailed in Arens' paper). Therefore, if $f\in (N,K^c)$, then either $\phi(f)(K)\subset V\subset U$ (this is what we want) or $\phi(f)(K)\subset \overline{W}^c$. In order to rule out the second case, we make the additional assumption (again without loss of generality) that $K$ has non-void interior, then we take a point $p$ in the interior. If $f\in (N,K^c\cap e(W))\cap (\{e^{-1}(p)\},\mathring{K})$, then $f(e^{-1}(p))\subset K$, but then $e^{-1}(p)\in \phi(f)(K)\cap V$, which is non-empty, and therefore we have ruled out the second case and $f\in (K,V)\subset (K,U)$. 

It seems there exists such a thing: There is a spectral sequence by Anderson that computes the homology of the mapping space out of the cohomology of $M$ and the homology of $N$. Here is a link to the announcement: $URL$ I have not been able to find the subsequent paper with the proof.
