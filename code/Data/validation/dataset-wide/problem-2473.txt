Ruben2020, and who ever might be interested in answers of you question: Begin a time where the matter of "what makes one a stream-winner" seems to interest many and maybe because many "Noble-Born" are currently remind, meting they reminder, on their old path they have already gone, it's maybe worthy to recollect the teachings informations about this matter in a good manner and everybody should be encouraged here to point out possible mistakes and missing points. ❋ - Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammā-sambuddhassa - ❋ 

At one occation the "Bu-SE yogis" have assembled in the forum and talked about "Are the Jataka tales of the Pali Canon authentic words of the Buddha?/ In what timeframe was Jataka tales added to Kuddaka Nikaya?", histrory, bad and good guys a around it and soon engaged in loud disputes. Then Johann entered and looked after what the matter was and thought "it would be better to talk on Dhamma or dwell in silence (2. Jhana), what would be good here to give or to avoid?" And the wrote: (Note, the stile here is to make it more alive and a teaching it self, no need to assume Johann as Buddha or anything special at all. But you can use such idea to lift yourself and your awarness if you like and find it useful) Relating a little to the answer of Dhammadhuta here and itk possible problems: both, to be and not to be, are no really useful question for the path. Why, because if pondering wether "is it" or "is it not" "was it" "was it not" "what will it be if it was" "if it was not, where...", all this questions that cause dukkha are not contuctive for getti g beyound it and one can continue them endless and each stand will cause another to fight it. So maybe its better to ask maybe: 

"What do I not see for now, or overlook currently,that I see there conratictions? Whish part did I not understand so that it causes me doubt?" 

Being conscious, having consciousness, feeling, certain intellect... is not what makes a being a living being, thought on Unconscious beings (asaññasatta), still considered as satta (beings) althought nāma (mind is very subtile), Like a empty glass would be considered as empty of liquid, yet still wet. Sects have developed their certain views and for the most plant like is not considered as living being, but if we take a look at the suttas, Buddha did not spoke of a para-Samsara in the wheel of birth: 

In reagard of more detail of the virtue, my person gave recently some words on it in a discussion: Can there be Non-Attachment without Virtue? In regard of recognition by others (and in the case one seeks for prove by others), is needed to know, that only a "person on integrity (e.g. a Noble One)" can know of anothers persons integrity (MN 110). The Sutta Paṭisalla Sutta: Seclusion contains also explainings here that: 

Sherly, giving up ones carrier (that what is carry one on in the wheel of love and suffering) is already a beginn for a good "Buddhist" carrier and to start this Dhamma-carrier with Generosity and giving ones wealth is the normal right fist step, but be careful to do not use Bussiness with Generosity as a means for exact the same way as before just by changing the company to this modern one which has stolen the original trademarks of the Buddha. At least, why would you like to help the poor if not out of love again? If willing to wander on in the world pleasant, chose a rightious lifelihood and don't be a trader in generosity and Dhamma 

In regard of the virue of a streamwinner there are many views and disputes of which, how and if a streamwinner can break the basic four precepts and missconuct in consuming means which cause heedlessness. Since the virtue of a Noble person of first degree is based on gained right view, he/she is not able to act strong unskillful deliberated. It might be that faulty acts happen in "affect", but even done he/she does not hidde such a fault and has a natural desire to confess it immediately. How ever, he/she is in any case incapable to performing acts out of niyata micca ditthi, evil wrong view, and therefore incapable: 

He/She maybe not conscious about having the " Dhamma-eye but like answered to question 4. is not in a strong danger to follow wrong teacher, in an amout that is not in the frame of the conduct and way of thinking of a Noble One. Becoming aware about the Dhamma is also answered under question 4, which can have four general typs of reminder: 

So to do not only dwell at this or that end of ones world/cosmos, just to find out that this end is not lasting at "the end", one needs to understand "The All" incl. the sixth sense-door, mind, and this "All" has a limit of whichs beyound, Nibbana, can not be declared or explained, the end of all suffering. Sabba Sutta: The All 

The answers should already countain the sources. One of the best collection of Suttas might be the Studyguiden Into the Stream - A Study Guide on the First Stage of Awakening, by Bhante Thanissaro, which will provide many additional informations and teachings, not only for gifted "Noble-Born's" but also for Dhamma-, Faith- and most suggested for those "with little faith" for now, to not only gain more of it, but also put all means into practice and finish a task so less are capable, bringing behind the most of all burdens to be for ever behind. 

AN 4.191 indicates that one (here a previous monk appearing under Devas), if not reminding him-/herselves ("dies with a muddled mind") either is remembered by 

Itks maybe worthy to keep in mind that one needs to be very honest and proof very in detail all corners and dismantel any kind of quickly made judgement in its seriousity. That, how ever, requires to know, heaving heard the good teachings and understand clearly their meaning. In regard of the fetters, a stream-winner has abounded the first three lower fetters of the ten fetters: 

Let my person now end here, and may this words and explaining be a foundation for many to find the entrence to the path of the circle of beginnings and ends, suffering. May all beings rejoice with the merits here done by the support of many with their previous contributions, given possibilities and sacrifies and may the Devas tell those, who have not seen, have not heard, about. Anumodana! A maybe modified and extended version of the answer you may find here where you are also welcome to discuss and place comments: [Q&A] The Cosmos, traveling the Cosmos, and its limits and reaching its End.

At this stage one with discernment, could have transcendent form (rūpa), but to complete - the first needed - task finaly, it goes on: 

In judging at least, there are indications that the Buddha left it to ones possibility to recognice it as such, which is on one hand seen in the fact that in certain rules dealing with live not only the factor "it must be a living being" but also "one needs to recognize it as living being" are needed to be present. In regard of how careful one needs to observe the pointing on: "even if as small as an bedbug" shows not only matters of size but also the knowing "this could have life" when thinking on egg as criteria. In the Metta-sutta, the Lord Buddha is said to have meantioned: sata (creatures), pāṇā (what has life/breath), bhūtā (being born) and also "seeking for birth", aside of size and visibility as objects of metta (goodwill) So generally, rather to seek for food that does not cause suffering or to speculate that in this or that birth one becomes not just food at the end, is to use the fact that life needs food, and life always ends up as being just food, wiser to let all appearances of life one recognises be a force od saṃvega ("fear") and to go on an gain and use life best and proper to make suffering an end while being as harmless as possible: Puttamansa Sutta: A Son's Flesh And seeing that to much answering might derive others here from certain food from it, its maybe also a good time to make a leave here for now and let others take birth as they like by do not derive them from possible taking even a birth followed by Saddha (refuge in the Gems and Sila) and end up in the Unbound, the deathlessness. By practicing the four Jhanas (improper) one can become a Unconscious beings (asaññasatta) which is generally not so desired by the most. Anumodana, and don't forget your duties in regard of your Gods and father and ancestors not today!

To regard the first. Whenreading the stories and look also torward the situation they are told, the actors their structure and the possible purpose (see also "Befriending the Suttas - Tips on Reading the Pali Discourses" In this manner, when starting with the stories situations when told by themselfes, they mostly have been stories been told when the community of monks was assambled and allone with the Buddha, mostly involved in idle talk or when issues of Vinaya or special things happened. When the minds awarness is currently in a very low stage, eager ofter papanca, its not possible to pull it into a sphere of Jhana and teach then things beyound the world. So the anchor here was always also very wordily to use the situation to give a lesson on moral, Vinaya but mostly to increase faith, that the audiance will be urged on one hand: "if you do like them, you will face this" (samvega) and on the other hand faith in this regard, that "even not really practising on the path, my merits have been of that sort, that I am now able to teach you as a Buddha", aside of the many sacrifies done to gain such perfections. So they are mostly not really purposed and in situations when supramudane teaching would have been possible. In regard of urging the monks, for certain purpose of stilling desire after wordily stories (like you mostly have, TV, relatives... socialicings), or the way my person here presents an answer, similar, not with to high teaching to keep the mind entertaint and lift it to the most possible state, teaching there faith and precepts, the basics for the path. Such teaching in stories, if either intended for idle purpose, to simply socialize for gains, or when meeting an audience that is only capable to use the food for entertaining the mind wrong, is of course fast and easy to use for currupt ways and for a bad. Here again, the stories most have been told under the monks and in certain situations. Since a longer it was usual, especially because the audience is, if after gain, naturally a greedy one and after low etertainment, to use them as simple medium for improper purposes, but that circumstances does not make them bad, useless, unreal or not conductive perse. Every good teacher will from time to time sit down with his disciples and tell "very human" stories. My person, for example, likes to tell such a "Jataka" in relation of "when I was stil a Bodhisatta, not walking direct on the path", "Devas" and fatherday, to give a moral lesson and chances to increase faith (Saddha, Sila and certain Samvega) like in the cinema (action, horror and love) for a good entertainment and purpose to increase the good qualities of mind, not to wn a lokk of audience for gains, even "risking" that most will say "look at this crazy". The secound question is this of encountering seemingly conflicts, more and lesser, which mostly is because we again have this "this is real, only this" desire, forgetting that the teaching is a step by step way and has not equanimity and or Nibbana at the beginn, in the middle as in the end as means, but that are results of seeing "now this is the front and that is the behind" and vici versa and to know where our mind currently dwells, is attached with. If we make all a matter of "not-self" not understanding that there are places where we need to multiplicate and places where we need to divide to get the task of de-velopement done, we/they are not only simply celebrate the Uposatha of the Jains, being just thieves and just cut us simply of for long time. On the other hand, if we use the Jatakas like those celerbrating the Uposatha of the cowherds, we/they might not shine radiant, but do at least not cut them of from the path entirely, even if simply after gain and at least keep the cart, even without goods inside, alive. If we use them like the elders and wise did since they exist, for laypeople especilly and all those still need to increase moral and faith to gain path, than we simply use them for the Ariya-Uposatha purpose, take the moral, practice the eight Silas minimum while listening and rejoice in the dwelling caused by the reflections, Buddhannusati... Devannusati, turn our mind to where ever it is nice to dwell or even use the teachings of a higher when having reached this concentrations and go beyound rebirth and their stories. How ever, without the steps and their means, the higher can not be reached and if they have been ture, the steps and means, you will know only for sure, if you could have reached the heavenly realms or even awakening, as for the last it might be that you even again, do not really grasp after this question any more but maybe just give them as means for others to be able to clime up ond beyound where you have gone, beyond. So having actually not been anywhere, it would be maybe not wise to cut away and destroy by starving it, what you can not understand for not or not clear enought to understand the purpose before having done the task. To give at the end a simily of Ajhan Chah:
