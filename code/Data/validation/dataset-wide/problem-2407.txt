I was reading the wiki page about Akashic records and in 'See also' there is link to Glossary of Buddhism, so it seems like it's connected. Therefore do you believe in akashic records or something similar where all events and our experiences are stored? 

By meditating you are increasing the flow of kundalini (life force) in your body's meridian system (body's channel network). This helps you to removes all kind of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual blockages you can have. This process opens emotional highways to areas that have been hidden for you. The purpose is to become more sensitive to energies around you by developing abilities that allow you to travel in your own emotional evolution and be spiritually connected. The sound is basically a vibration where certain hearing ranges can be perceived by your brain and translate into auditory perception. When you are meditating, you are getting into your higher aspect of your being where your consciousness raising and expands and you can basically feel that vibration of the sound through your light body (that is why it can be so intense). 

There is usually no 'we', as in most cases studies are performed by limited number of people within limited set of conditions on limited number of people (which they barely know) using limited laboratory setups (spirit world doesn't work like that), and other people just reading about their conclusions which are influenced by their own point of view. Then the rest repeating what they've just read without trying to repeat the same study for them-self justifying they won't be able to achieve the same under same laboratory conditions. Furthermore, we tempt to reject any successful metaphysical studies (such as this one) given the fact that we no longer subject metaphysical experiments to the laws of physics. So according to modern scientific logic, if you can't measure something - it doesn't exist, even you can experience it or see it with your own eyes (e.g. Qi Gong experiment). Same with dreams and thoughts. We know they do exist, but they cannot be measured using physical instruments (we can measure brain waves, but it doesn't prove their existence). This is due to fact that majority experiencing this phenomenon and no one questioning it. Similar with OBE, if more people will experience this in first person, at the end we'll have to accept it as a fact without able to measure it. So what about changing scientific approach from relying on external sources into experiencing them on your own (similar like with dreams)? Like experiencing flow of energy in your third eye which could not take long time to practice. Many people in the world mastered astral projection which was studied by many scientists in the past with successful results. So in fact, you can 'observe' this phenomena, however not by using scientific physical instruments, but by experiencing yourself and observing it directly by inducing an OBE via meditation. You can also experience and measure this phenomenon using your own mind-body-spirit complex if we can classify own being as a measuring instrument. 

As far as my curiosity managed to spread to far, I think Ajaan Fuang is a great example. Not much is known about him except for a few transcribed talks and some quotes here and there, and some stories told by his students of their experiences with him. One thing I remember about him, as far as being different goes, was that one time some Thai Monk Magazine (or something along those lines) went after him, trying to get an interview. When he heard about this, he avoided them at all cost. Finally they managed to pin him down somewhere, and asked him, "Could you give us a dhamma talk?" His response was, "Yes. Today's dhamma talk is one word: 'buddho.' If you can't keep this in mind, there really isn't any point in my telling you anything else." Another great quote is, 

So in this sutta it looks more like he's worried about the auspiciousness of the environment rather than the current condition in which a monk dwells, and his being pleased is based on his assumption that the monk will soon generate right effort, and not that he'll be heedless. However, I think it's important to stress that Ajahn Brahm's purpose for telling this story, regardless of where he had heard it, were probably that he has many lay followers which come to the practice with high expectations for quick results. He has to teach people how to give themselves some breathing space first - and that, I believe, he does very well. 

Maybe mentioned NMR scanning was not the right tool to measure something out of thin air and giving subjective "prove" that nothing survives after our death based on the failed experiment. There were many attempts using different methods which were actually successful. For example Russian scientist Konstantin Korotkov photographed a person at the moment of his death with a bioelectrographic camera and his Kirlian photography shows the life force of the person leaving the body gradually. 

Proof can be subjective (everybody expects different sets of evidences). Most of the studies are very limited and based on the wrong scientific assumptions that all matter is unconscious, consciousness is an illusory artefact of the chemical brain and there is no spirit, no mind and nothing other than mechanical and chemical stuff. There are many hypotheses of our existence and ultimately we can never prove something for 100% as there are always some other factors due to complexity of our reality that we're living. The problem is that a scientific theory must make testable or refutable predictions of what should happen or be seen under a given set of new, independent, observing or analysis circumstances from the particular problem or observation the theory was originally designed to explain. Therefore you can't even prove your own existence. Secondly non-physical spirit world can't be measured using physical instruments, because it doesn't make sense to do that and it goes beyond that. However there are certain scientific studies which proves otherwise (that mind is produced by the brain), for example Consciousness as a State of Matter (see: video) by Max Tegmark, Professor of Physics at MIT which explains that consciousness can be understood as a state of matter (perceptronium), capable of giving rise to self-awareness and subjectivity. 

In the early suttas, this sort of question is deemed irrelevant for the practice; that is, as long as there's a problem, and you can do something about it, then any time wasted on wondering whose problem is it, what constitutes a problem, does it have an inherent existence shared by all beings, etc, is categorized as falling victim to Mara. [1] That being said, here are a few things to consider: 

I've heard Ajahn Brahm tell this story during a lecture which was recorded on YouTube, so I can confirm it's definitely told by him; however I don't remember which one it was. The story is not (strictly) in the suttas. It is probably (very loosely) based on AN 6.42, and deals more with the disturbances of nearby lay life as opposed to the wilderness. 

My 2 cents: Before you can judge whether another person is accomplished, at anything, or not, you have to be accomplished yourself. You have to develop your sensitivity such that you know true from false even in very subtle cases. I'd say that as long as the Buddha inspires you, pushes you to do things which deep down you know are right, you stick with it to the best of your ability. Ultimately it is said we should know for ourselves. There is no clear-cut proof for a claim for which its axioms have not been laid down and understood. And by what teachers tell us, nibbana is not a logical conclusion based on our pervasive daily axioms, it's an axiom to be verified for oneself. Until we realize the truth of this axiom, our job is to stick with it and see what it leads to, where it leads us. And we just keep pushing forward, chipping away at our mental defilements, each one at their own pace. But any steady pace is better than staying in place, to say nothing of regressing. As for living inside the matrix, you should realize that this perception is a modern one, and brings with it quite a load of baggage from science fiction, so you should be very careful with it. To the extent of my readings, the Buddha never spoke about delusion in terms of the existence of objects (in fact he did not approve of such discussions), but rather in terms of the benefits we perceive in our conventions, which simply keep us in the cycle, because the nature of our objects is to appear, cease, and reappear, over and over again. Each time they near perishing, we should be very careful about our suppositions. We should realize their nature, that our control over their ways is limited, so as to not crash down with them. 

Science was also clear some time ago that our Earth is flat. If you think the example is too old, what about long-term clarity of science that there are no any planets in our Solar System beyond Pluto due to ultimate trust in modern scientific measurement tools (not to mention wide criticism of researchers who claimed opposite)? Now science found something opposite, that there is actually extra Solar System planet (appeared from nowhere?) and now we need to rewrite a lot of scientific books again. Therefore please be aware that science is constantly evolving, scientific theories constantly are superseded by new one which are more adequate and it would be very wrong to assume that all current scientific assumptions are fixed (see: superseded scientific theories). Therefore we can't assume that a single body-of-knowledge has the ultimate truth. Science means 'knowledge' and it's about questioning everything and seeing everything from the different point of view based on conclusions given the available data. 

Our current neuroscience beliefs state that our memories are stored chemically in the brain and disappear at death, therefore you can't simply attain enlightenment by neurosurgical means, because our mind is not physical. Think of our brain as an interface to our non-physical mind (consciousness). So enlightenment is not something that can be invoked physically, the same as cutting Einstein's brain won't give you any intelligence gains, no matter how our neuroscience would progresses. Enlightenment can be achieved only by a state of mind of your spiritual progress. As our neuroscience accelerates, we can only enhance our brain circuitry to process more data (like photographic memory, abstract thoughts, etc.), as our current brains only handle an narrow amount of the information that is constantly being fed at the unconscious level, but it's nothing to do with attaining enlightenment. 

Speaking of Ajaan Maha Boowa, you should have a look at the book available in several formats, for free, here. It's a translated transcription of several talks and Q&A sessions he gave to lay followers in London back in 1974. 

Just like anything, if you approach a subject thinking that all you need to do in order to understand it is to reduce it into terms you already feel comfortable with, terms that are already socially acceptable, you're going to face obstacles in getting to the deeper message. Getting an academic education today, and the ego boost it can leave you with if you're prone to that kind of thing, is bound to be a kind of obstacle to understanding. I suspect that the intention of the author was to imply just this, and not that reason is to be thrown out the door. 

I tend to side with this approach. In many ways a good working example of its beauty is the Thai Forest Tradition. You can read more about it on the DhammaTalks website. Noted teachers are: Ajaan Mun, Ajaan Lee, Ajaan Fuang Jotiko, Ajaan Chah, and Ajaan Suwat. Also, an American monk who had trained there for over 10 years: Thanissaro Bhikkhu. There are many things in later texts (e.g. Abdhidhamma) which directly contradict instructions given in the canon - instructions which, though hard to follow, seem to have razor-sharp reasoning and efficiency if adhered to. The Thai Forest Tradition shows that you don't need a PhD. in Buddhist Studies in order to penetrate the message. As Ajaan Chah once put it, 

People are believing in reincarnation concept, because it makes perfect sense. Based on above mentioned facts and by connecting all the dots together, one can easily come into same logical conclusion without need of blindly following mainstream knowledge. When you come into realization that consciousness is not only illusory artefact of the chemical brain, but it's omnipresence beyond time and space (where time and space is illusionary construct, even according to Einstein), you will start seeing everything from different angle and your mind's perception will change forever. 

These are wrong assumptions. You need to open your mind and start seeing reality in terms of waves, not the separate atoms (oneness not separateness). Double slit experiment (see: video) gives another clue that it is consciousness that affects our reality and that we are actually living in simulated reality (see: holographic principle). Recent UK, Canadian and Italian study gives evidence that our universe could be a vast and complex hologram where information makes up our 3D 'reality', not atoms it-self. Professor Skenderis comments: "Einstein’s theory of general relativity explains almost everything large scale in the universe very well, but starts to unravel when examining its origins and mechanisms at quantum level. Scientists have been working for decades to combine Einstein’s theory of gravity and quantum theory. Some believe the concept of a holographic universe has the potential to reconcile the two." Based on above recent studies, it is suggested that all physical manifestation (including illusional existence of atoms) comes from self-aware consciousness which can be a state of matter. 

One thing which is important to remember is that the Big Bang theory is a mathematical model that fits in with physical observations and helps with predictions. The model is beneficial in that it's both useful and intuitive. However, there might be many more models, possibly more complex, or simpler, which would do the same job. Saying we know that a Big Bang occurred is thus a shorthand for saying "for our intents and purposes, it's good enough to assume that a Big Bang occurred." However, although it's good enough for cosmological study, it's obviously not good enough for individual predictions, i.e. which code of conduct will lead to the highest form of welfare. For this purpose, empirical science has found its way into the field of psychology, which is, unfortunately, notoriously lacking. The Buddha's Dhamma includes such a code of conduct, and certain cosmological references, but always in terms of the individual, e.g. what gives birth to our experience of the world, what sorts of possibilities are there to experience, what sort of conduct leads to each, etc. Though the Buddha recalled past lives from, to quote, "many eons of cosmic expansion and contraction," he didn't present (in the suttas) any clear-cut genesis story. There is one sutta where he talks of how worlds of experience are generated, but never in terms of the origination of "what's out there." Nor did he take a stance on whether things have an inherent existence or not. You'll find many interpretations of the Buddha's statements about the world. For instance, when he describes an "intergalactic void with a darkness beyond any other," it correlates with black holes. When he speaks of other realms of existence, it correlates with other galaxies, or (considering recent cosmological theories) universes. When he talks of beings who are invisible to the ordinary human eye, it correlates with the theory of dark matter. But it's crucial to note that these are all worthless speculations, which might or might not have anything to do with his intentions. They have nothing to do with the tasks he left us with. It's useful to note how, even though infinitesimally few people have been on the moon, us lay men and women always want to hear more about the size of the universe. When we think of the solar system, we're awed; the milky way, woah; the observable universe, and now the multiverse theory, we just can't get enough. If and when multiverse becomes a standard belief, we're going to watch out for bigger revelations. All of this to feed out insatiable intellect. Regardless of whether the size and origination of the universe is of any importance to us, we can clearly see why the Buddha, even if he knew about it, would not even spare a taste if it didn't directly support his path of practice, which is said to be the path to end the craving for existence and thus the end of all of our stress and suffering. Hence, Science and Buddhism are not in competition. We study science for certain purposes. We practice Buddhism for others, such as to set clear boundaries for ourselves so our minds don't get carried away with ideas and sensations. In doing so, he implied we'll be able to find out the truth about many things. But that in itself wasn't the basis for his message - one which he said we urgently needed to hear.
