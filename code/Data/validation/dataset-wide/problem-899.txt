This is actually fairly common and has no real significance. It's a purely decorative process called edge painting (or fore-edge painting) because it's color painted on the fore-edge of the book (go figure). It's common on religious texts, but that's only because religious texts simply tend to be better made and better decorated. It's quite general, though. 

So, no. He hasn't, and won't, talk about it. He gives another self-reply, which explains why it's taken so long, and why he wishes people would stop asking about it: 

I recently finished Flatland (full text link), and I found it generally a somewhat disconcerting read. I realize that it's satire, and it's written in the tone of satire, particularly when it comes to women - but some of the remarks that they make in writing are very off-putting. I can conclude roughly one of three things: 

The entire crew died, excepting Odysseus, fairly early in the Odyssey at the hands of Zeus by request of Helios. Pretty early on, Odysseus warns the crew not to eat the sheep on Helios' island (XII 417-422, Robert Fagles): 

So it's known that as a practice it goes back at least that far. Chabad holds a slightly less reserved view: 

While it's possible to hypothesize about how O'Brien ended up in government work following being had, perhaps suggesting that practices have changed over time, or aren't as absolute as they seem, the fact remains: he was probably caught, and was probably stopped. 

So, there you have it. It would seem to have originated in the 9th or 10th century out of a desire to codify, and make a pass at standardizing, the way cant works. As to the differences between Ashkenazi and Sephardic cant, well - cantillation isn't a part of the Torah itself, and doesn't necessarily have to stay fixed. Since there's no religious imperative to maintain universal cant in Judaism, it makes sense that different groups and regions would drift apart in cant at different times. (If you've ever been to services in differing temples, you'll know what I mean - many of the cants sound similar, and although frequently, are not always identical.) 

This methodology consistently gives passages multiple meanings, where one could easily gloss over it without any recognition. It appears that this may have been done to tie memories more closely to the narrator, rather than conveying them as independent scenes. The lack of quotation marks is for depicting personal thoughts and feelings, as well as dialog as it appears in her memory. This would fit well with one of the book's underlying themes of gaslighting. Memory is unreliable, and is in the eye of the beholder. Quotation marks are a sign that what's being written is exactly what's being said, and removing them when the narrator begins to discuss memories is a subtle way of instilling doubt: it's just her word, only. There is no record. 

Tolkien answers these questions in the appendices of the physical copies of many of the original books. (Some editions of the books don't include the pronunciation guides, but most do.) A more detailed pronunciation guide, however, appears in the back of the Silmarillion, which was kindly reproduced by this blogger. You can also find some more details on the Tolkien Gateway. Your specific questions, answered: 

The song Mabel Grey, by Brown Bird contains peculiar lyrics. The lyrics are awfully specific about what happened to this ship, which is a common pattern I see when a song is referent to a real-life event. It's reminiscent of Barrett's Privateers, in that it appears like it could be referring to a specific event, and is written in the form of a historical allusion. But, while Barrett's Privateers is fictional, it contains the details needed to tell a full story. Mabel Grey here seems to be a snapshot of some existing story - its descriptions are both cursory and rather specific, leaving a great number of holes for the listener to either fill in, or, alternately, understand within a pre-existing context. That leads me to wonder if the Mabel Grey was a real ship and person. There certainly have been both ships and people named "Mabel Grey" (or, Gray). Notably, two schooners that wrecked have borne the name: one sunk on March 11, 1904, off the coast of California, and the other has an entry on ShipIndex, but doesn't seem to have any other public information. These are my best guesses as to where I would start. But I really have no clue. Is this song referring to a real event? If not, is it new fabrication, or does it refer to something else? 

It is clear from web pages such as this one and this one that (unlike "sonnet" or "limerick" or "tanka") the term "grook" or "gruk" is not a widely used term for a recognizable verse form but rather a word invented by Piet Hein for the poems he wrote. It is possible someone other than Hein has written grooks, but the Internet does not seem to know about them. Hein, with his starkly elegant design work (see this for a suprising instance), seems to have become a Danish culture hero. But I do not think his poetry is much imitated. 

For a discussion of what Byron is saying here, see R.P. Lessenich's Romantic Disillusionism and the Sceptical Tradition: 

The important bit here is that "the elves took him". This, I suppose is what Tennyson based his version of this detail in his Idylls of the King, which has passages like 

Apparently there was a folk belief or folk saying that pigs can see the wind. This is seen in line 1108 of Part 2, Canto III of Samuel Butler's 1684 Hudibras, with the line "As pigs are said to see the wind". (Footnote 139 of an edition of Canto VII of Don Juan pointed me to Hudibras.) Google will lead to many occurrences, including an essay by Emerson, in YouTube videos and in the lyrics of Johnny Cash and in discussions of folklore. One occurrence is in a bizarrely bad anonymously written story "The Pirate and the Cruiser" anthologized in Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of Blessington's The Honey-Moon: 

This is not an exact answer to the original question. TROTAM was first published in Bristol in 1798 in a collection by Coleridge and Wordsworth, Lyrical Ballads. As one might expect, the very first edition is rare, and subsequent editions numerous. The earliest version I have found on-line is of a 1798 London edition. It titles the poem as ""THE RIME OF THE ANCYENT MARINERE,/ IN SEVEN PARTS." The parts are labelled simply "I." , "II.", on up through "VII.", (without the word part) each starting on a fresh page, with fancy rules above and below the numbers. 

Here the contrast is between two worlds, the world of action and the domestic world. (Green, cow-studded Holland versus Italy, with its blasphemy, strong passion, vice.) Most chapters are simply numbered, lacking titles; of those with titles most are either "The Hearth", "The Cloister", or "The Cloister and the Hearth", naming the scene of the chapter. The passage quoted above is at the end of Chap 73, "The Hearth"; the next, Chap 74, "The Cloister" starts out 

In general "vessel" can mean a ship or boat, or a container for liquids. I suppose your quotation takes it in the latter sense. 

I had previously checked that the detail the OP asked about was not in Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain, so I turned to a modern English translation of Layamon's Brut which has this to say about that: 

It's a small world: the anthologist knew Byron, having met him in 1823, soon after Canto VII was written, and wrote a book about him. The story itself seems to have first appeared in the United service journal, and naval and military magazine; October, 1836. 

describing the scuttlebutt that Gareth heard in the scullery. Here "the Prophet" is Merlin. And elsewhere in the Idylls: 

If you enter the google books search "part second" you will see this construction was a perfectly normal practice in the 1700 and 1800s. Here are some of the hits I got: to The Ploughboy: A Poem, Part Second (W. Cook, 1855), to Sadlier's Catholic first reader: part second, Part 2 (James A. Sadlier, 1883), and to Zoonomia ; Or, the Laws of Organic Life: Part Second. By Erasmus Darwin, M.D. of 1797. There are many others. I think "part the second" is more common, as in Both Sides of the Gutter: Part the second by P. Byrne. Both it and "part second" mean, of course, "the second part". You are possibly familiar with Carroll's The Hunting of the Snark, whose cantos are "Fit the first", "Fit the second", which is more of the same sort of thing. For yet more instances of this construction, try google books "chapter fifth": I got hits on Walter Scott, Jules Verne, and so on. To answer your question: your book says "Part first" and so on because that's what the author wrote. This style seems odd or ungrammatical to you only because you are imperfectly familiar with 19th century English. As a speculative aside: I think usages like "Part the first" and so on might once have been more common than "Part one", with the ordinal form of numbers being more common in such contexts than the cardinal form, and that the use of Arabic or Roman numbers in spelling might be connected with this shift. To this day when we read aloud the written words "King Richard III" we actually say "King Richard the third", and sometimes when we see "December 25" we say "December twenty-fifth" or "December the twenty-fifth". Although written English is "alphabetic", the phonetic basis or theory of the alphabet (which in English is applied in notoriously quirky ways, but still applied) does not govern the pronunciation of Arabic or Roman numerals. According to this speculative theory, the usage "Part first" that OP reports would once have been a correct reading of "Part 1" and its use here reflects both the conservative habit of using ordinals in this context and an archaizing tendency to avoid the use of Arabic numbers in the form "Part 1". 

I also found a far more authoritative source, Jacqueline Pelliccio from Rutgers University, who notes that the absence of quotation marks in characters' memories are indeed intended to cast doubt on the integrity of the dialog: 

Note: the fact that farm tools double as weapons is pertinent to understanding some of the things characters say, and isn't explained as such in-text, except contextually. 

This honestly exactly mirrors the pacing of the story. Kassad's story starts out as a militaristic reminder that philosophical arguments won't really help that much in the face of this kind of struggle. It then sidetracks into the arrival of Moneta, and his relationship to/with her, in a way that could only be uncomfortably described as pretty close to divine and divine intervention. Besides, Kassad's story ends after the Shrike arrives. 

There's a common trope in Western fantasy that, up until now, I've sort of taken for granted: the "true name." This is the idea that all things have true names that are somehow more closely linked to what the thing is, and that knowing it grants some degree of power over the thing. This has many forms and tropes, but they all have the exact same underlying elements. Most commonly, though, it's used as a plot device with regard to people: 

Notably, the primary cause for doubt (the phrasing of some 80 letters) is still there in Spanish, and is actually a little stronger in its conveying the idea of an approximation. "Some" in English doesn't necessarily mean there's deviation; it can just be a color word. But what in English is written as "some 80 letters which are black in color" is written in Spanish as "de unas ochenta letras de color negro." The key word in Spanish is unas - it's not actually strictly necessary, and adds a little bit of ambiguity, because here, it just means "approximately" or "about." It can still be a color word in Spanish, but I think that's less likely. If Borges wanted to say that, yes, they are exactly 80 letters, Borges would probably have left it at "de ochenta letras." ...but, just before that, Borges does say "...libros de formato uniforme," and enumerates exactly the ways that the books in "uniform format." The linking of the books' uniform format and eighty-letter rows in the same sentence heavily implies that all the rows in all the books are 80 characters long. If you want to doubt that there are 80 characters in a row, there's definitely a reason to, but I don't think it's a very good one. 

You don't have to read that. You probably shouldn't, honestly. But this is by far not the only example of this sort of stream-of-consciousness meandering excess in the Papers. I know Hamilton was operating on a short time-scale when writing, drafting, revising, submitting, and printing these essays. But this smacks of a disregard for any sort of editing process. This sort of leads me to wonder: were the Federalist Papers ever edited in a thorough and rigorous way? If so, by whom? And if so, what on earth were they checking for, and what changes did they make (if we know)? I'm more interested in whether there is evidence that they were vetted by a third party, but if there's information on Hamilton's approach to self-editing that could be relevant, I'd count that, too. 

I recently started reading the book, "Social Justice in Islam." This is a book by Sayyid Qutb, translated into English by John B. Hardie, commissioned by the Near Eastern Translation Program. There's not really any good references to any of these people online outside this book, nor is there any information about what the Near Eastern Translation Program was or what it did. Questions about who ran this program and why aside (though I'm very curious to know), they went to great lengths in their translation to highlight the controversiality of this book. But they really didn't talk about what in it was controversial, who found it controversial, and why they classify it that way. The foreword to the book reads like someone defensively trying to justify translating this book, ending, for example, with:
