The Eighty-Years' War / Thirty-Years War which ends in 1648 with the Westphalia Treaties was a very long conflict in which all European countries and peoples took part in various coalitions, alliances that changed over time. It is widely considered as a religious War because the catholic European powers (Holy Roman Empire, Spain, etc) fought against Protestant enemies protected by Gustav Adolph of Sweden, later joined by Catholic France, who wants to counter-balance the power of the Austrian Habsbourg dynasty and prevent them from reaching hegemony in Europe through the transformation of the Holy Roman Empire in a "real" State (it was rather a confederation). But it is also a struggle between the Holy Roman Empire and its northern and eastern dependencies and a political struggle in the Holy Roman Empire to strengthen the weak power of the Habsbourg Emperor. However it is a major conflict in European history in which the alliances changed a lot. It led to the formation of a power structure in continental Europe that lasted until the Napoleonic Wars. 

This is a play from the 14th century (reportedly "the first secular tragedy written since Roman times") relating the tale of Ezzelino da Romano and written by one Albertino Mussato. Is there an online English text? Or at least a published book where it appears in translation? 

What examples can you find of these? I want the list to include people who satisfy two criteria: (a) Major political leader = king, president, prime-minister, very senior cabinet minister, mayor of capital, something in this league. (b) Scientist = someone who has actively worked in science (published papers or books) or at the very least had an impressive career in industrial R&D (with technical accomplishments, not just as a bureuacrat). One example: Chaim Weizmann. Another, less obvious one which makes the cut nevertheless: Yury Luzhkov EDIT: Adding from answers: Angela Merkel, Tony Tan. 

In France they called it "The Great War" (La Grande Guerre), pacifist veterans called it "La der' des der'" (The Last of the Last (Wars)). In England it was called the World War, or the Great War. I think the German diplomats were the first to call it a World War (Weltkrieg), before it even began. I don't know of any other names for it in German. i know that "satellite" wars have their own names in some countries, like in the Baltic states (where the fighting lasted until 1920) and maybe in Turkey and inÂ Greece. 

France wasn't prepared. The French strategy in the late 30s (including the military industry which had been greatly weakened in the 30s) did'nt include attacking Germany before 1941. They could have invaded Germany (the Ruhr would have been sufficient) in 1936 (before the Anschluss and the annexion of the Czech arm industry). But it was clearly not possible in 1939 (lack of planes, lack of an effective offnsive supply chain, lack of efficient tanks, even if they had th best models at that time). That's why they chose a defensive/attentist posture, that, strategically, was much likelier to succeed that the crazy German attack strategy that could have failed very quickly hadn't the French been so slow to react because of their rigidity, lack of efficient intelligence (or any intelligence), obsolete command structure and some unfortunate incidents (like half of the staff of the nothern French Army getting accidentally killed just before the discovery of the German attack). 

Now that the smart folks here have figured out what this is about, I was able to google a contemporary (!!) English sumamry of the case (written in 1794 so it does not take later developments into account, naturally): here. Another contemporary source which refers to the case, if rather tangentially, is the early (if not first ever) conspiracy theorist Barruel who claimed that the Neuweid situation had Illuminati written all over it. See here for his book. I don't know if any of his "facts" are true but since he was a contemporary, his reference to the matter might be useful. 

Partial answer: this page indicates that the trials were paid for by the Control Council of Germany, aka Allied Control Council. I couldn't find an online budget for the council, but perhaps the printed 9 volumes of its papers, duly mentioned in the wiki article, contain this information. 

With a caveat, I'd say "yes." The caveat is that there is no doubt that undemocratic violence and voter intimidation twisted the results somewhat (citation: Richard J. Evans, The Coming of the Third Reich, Penguin Press, New York, 2004), especially in the elections that brought him to power. His total of the vote would not have been as high without this violence. As to the point others make above about Hindenburg appointing him chancellor and bowing to pressure, especially from the millions of SA troops, I'd say that that's an undemocratic aspect to a democratic system. In the same way, America today has a news media with massive power to place or destroy candidates, and does so due to political pressure, financial incentives, all sorts of undemocratic reasons. This is undemocratic, but we don't claim unanimously that our political leaders all came to power undemocratically (?). To the extent that violent voter intimidation exaggerated Hitler's showing at the polls, that was indeed an undemocratically-won portion of the vote. However, I haven't seen any sources that show that he wouldn't have won enough to make a right-wing coalition, if he hadn't had that extra bit of phony, undemocratic help. 

Probably they got well mixed in the "generic Russian" gene pool, with not a few other peoples, and beyond the possibility of distinction nowadays. By the way, if I recall correctly, the current scholarly opinion is that only the nobility converted to Judaism and not the mass of the people. Hard to tell, though, as the sources are rather nebulous. If, however, the conversion was indeed limited to the nobility, then it'd be a very serious blow against the theory that Ashkenazi Jews are descended from Khazars. 

Actually, according to recently declassified records, it seems that Churchill was very much in favour of summarily executing Hitler should he be captured. Whether this would have really become policy or remained just a bit of Churchillian bluster is impossible to tell. 

The Red Orchestra (so code-named by the Gestapo, in contrast to the Black Orchestra, which were German conservatives against Hitler) were among the most famous communist resisters of Hitler and the Nazis. Some of their members, such as Harro Schulze-Boysen, were military soldiers or (in Schulze-Boysen's case) Luftwaffe-men operating in occupied eastern Europe. Schulze-Boysen was credited by the Gestapo with causing the deaths of a number of Gestapo spies during the Spanish Civil War because, as the Gestapo later found out, he was passing on their names to the leftist soldiers in the war (see Canaris by Heinz Hoehne, New York: Cooper Square Press, 1999, 241-2). Schulze-Boysen and fellow conspirators Hans and Hilde Coppi were working in Poland in 1942 when the Oberkommando des Heeres (Army High Command), having deciphered their secret communications with Moscow, arrested them. Boysen, the Coppis, another co-conspirator, Arvid Harnack, and Harnack's wife were all put to death. 

Well, turns out that there is a wikipedia article about this. It is not clear from the article how valuable in reality was the help the US got from Lucky Luciano. It certainly was valuable for him, procuring him an eventual release from prison... 

I think your chronological premise is wrong: there were large Jewish communities in Europe already in the early Middle Ages. For instance, in Germany. 

I have always presumed this to be the case. They have a similar form: two chambers, the lower representing "all the people" and the upper representing, very roughly speaking, "institutional forces" (in the British case it used to be the Church and the aristocracy, in the American case it's the states). The electoral system and the procedures are largely similar. It also stands to reason that the American Founding Fathers, being well-acquainted with the British political tradition, would have emulated it, adding what they surely perceived as improvements. And, as far as I know, Britain was the only European country to even have a proper parliament in the 18th century. But this is all surmise and conjecture, no matter how sensible. Is there documentary evidence that Congress is a conscious imitation of/improvement upon Parliament?
