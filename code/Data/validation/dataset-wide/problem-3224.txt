The Northern Expansion Doctrine was the idea that Japan should pursue its imperialist objectives through Siberia, which was diametrically opposed by the Southern Expansion Doctrine which was the idea that Japan should pursue its imperialist objectives in the Pacific. I know that the Southern Expansion Doctrine was supported by the navy and became the controlling doctrine for Japan's military actions after failure of the Northern Expansion Doctrine epitomized by the defeat of the Japanese army by the Soviet Union at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, but I cannot find any information about the formation of the Northern Expansion Doctrine. There is information out there about the genesis of the Southern Expansion Doctrine, but not the Northern Expansion Doctrine. My question is what was the genesis of the Northern Expansion Doctrine within the Japanese military, and government? 

The caloric intake of the average Cuban increased after the revolution, but since this was due to rationing there was little to no diversity in the diet. Pérez makes the claim that by the 1970's malnutrition had been all but wiped out. Similarly, education increased so that the percentage of the population completing sixth grade increased from 20% in 1953 to 32% in 1970. So all in all, there was a large impact. The immediate impact was very negative on the country. This was a combination of the exodus of people, and the hit to the economy. After time the impact became more positive, but is somewhat of a mixed bag. People's life expectancy went up, caloric intake increased, per capita income was redistributed, and literacy went up. These increases were not without cost. For further reading see: 

Another reason that minor political parties receive so few votes in the United States is the strength of party identification. The reality is that most people take on the political party of their family, and once they are a "member" of a political party they are very unlikely to change that membership for a minor political party. The book Partisan Hearts and Minds talks about how political party affiliation is similar to religious affiliation, except that you are more likely to switch your religious affiliation than your party affiliation. This strong sense of party identity is paired with a general disinterest in the specifics of the political system which has been expertly showcased in the seminal work American Voter, and the horribly depressing, but spot on, book Stealth Democracy. So, basically you have a system that was not designed with political parties in mind, populated by voters that are born into their political camps and have little interest in the specifics of the government/political system, which means that they are not terribly inclined to go through all the additional work that would come with supporting some third-party candidate. 

I found two sources that say that Trotsky was detained by British naval authorities in Halifax and spent time in a detention camp in nearby Amherst. 

After WWII France was in rebuilding mode, and yet they insisted on trying to reclaim Indo-China. It would seem that in the new world order this did not make much sense for a country that was trying to rebuild itself to commit to such a massive amount of blood and treasure to something that would arguably not produce much dividends in the future. I'm looking for some articulated reasons by the post-WWII French government to try and reclaim the territory, or a compelling cost-benefit argument as to why they pursued this course of action. 

So, if the government takes land for public use (say for example a factory to be repurposed to produce tanks) they would have to pay just compensation. Just compensation has been deemed to be fair market value at the time of the taking paid in cash. See e.g. Olson v. United States, 292 U.S. 246 (1934) The process is often referred to as Eminent Domain. I should point out that the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution makes the Fifth Amendment applicable to the States. In the United Kingdom the system is referred to as "Compulsory Purchasing." The University of Maryland has a nice discussion on takings in general. So yes, in common law based countries in the west, like the UK, and the US, compensation is likely to be offered, in fact it is required that it is offered. 

First, Haiti achieved independence in 1804, way before the US Civil-War. Haiti was originally called Saint-Domingue Wikipedia says that name was originally "Ayiti" as derived from Taíno and African languages 

From a geopolitical standpoint I would say that the United Nations, the Bretton Woods Institutions (World Bank and International Monetary Fund), and the World Trade Organization are the clearest examples of globalization. These organizations are the vehicles through which the countries of the world interact with each other, exchange ideas, handle problems created by new technologies, trade with each other, etc. Globalization really began with the rise of international trade, because trade is one of the chief ways that countries exchange ideas, and is also one of the motivating factors behind the actions of states. All of the organizations (UN, WB, IMF, WTO) deal in some ways with the free flow of trade, ideas, and people, which is what globalization is largely about. 

Before we get to the numbers it is important to state that the US Navy is really far and away the most capable blue-water navy in the world. The US Navy can project power over the entire planet. I'm not sure why you assert to the contrary in your question. Let's start with the US Navy force size from 1917-1923: 

But the above website doesn't cite where it gets the account of the information. So, your reading of the event never occurring seems to be in line with reality. There is no compelling and convincing evidence (that I could find) to believe that the event actually did happen. 

The reference on Wikipedia to Batista's resignation at a party on New Year's Eve in 1958 does not have a citation. I have been unable to find any reference that confirms Batista resigned at a New Year's Eve party. There is a source which states that Batista resigned at Cuban Army Headquarters on Jan. 1, 1959. This article in the UK newspaper The Guardian dated Jan. 2, 1959, does not mention where the resignation took place, but does confirm the flight from the country in the early hours around New Year's Eve. There is, however, a reference in a New York Times article from Jan. 2, 1959, that Batista resigned at Camp Columbia, the Cuban Army Headquarters, in the early hours of Jan. 1, 1959. The resignation at Camp Columbia would make sense, because Batista had officially come to power by means of a coup in 1952 that took place at Camp Columbia. Since the army was his base of power it would make sense that he would resign where his power was most concentrated, not to mention the access to airfields at the location allowing people to escape. 

The American Colonization Society thought that colonizing Africa for the purpose of returning US slaves to Africa was the solution to slavery problems. Why, and how, did they come to decide that the area now known as Liberia was the ideal choice for such an endeavor? Was it because most US slaves came from west Africa? 

The article seems to argue that the final option, the closing of the last pagan temples is the most appropriate for the end of the civilization. I can find a lot of articles advocating that the end was when the civilization was absorbed into the Roman Empire, but I am wondering is this the majority view amongst academics, and does it make the most sense as the end of the civilization? I realize this is somewhat opinion based (what history isn't?), but there should be someone who can articulate why one point is the accepted majority, if it exists at all.
