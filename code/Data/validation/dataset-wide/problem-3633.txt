A good shoe will adapt to your foot over time of using it. You want it to be comfortable at all times during running. I would stick with the suggestion of buying it at the end of the day. A walk into town should warm your feet up to their normal working size and shape. 

Not exactly the answer you are hoping for but the following resource could prove very useful: $URL$ You can get some significant strength gains using just your bodyweight and very basic playground style equipment (bars/boxes). If you are set on using a dumbbell here is a resource that gives you more options: $URL$ 

What you need is a bit of a lifestyle change but the first step, wanting to make a change, has been made by yourself and this should be your driver when being healthy is difficult and the caf√© muffins call to you. The most important next step is to fix this: 

Should I balance my exercise with my calorie-intake. Yes, sort of. If you are doing 3x 30 minute runs a week you probably don't need to adjust by much. You add that many calories back in through a very small amount of food. I personally run 3x 10k runs a week and sometimes one will be longer. Based on my heart rate monitor, I burn approximately 1000 calories per run. As a result I need to eat some carbs beforehand to ensure I have energy to perform the run and get a good time. I know this because I did some runs without adapting and suffered because my diet is low-carb and I do intermittent fasting. The point of all of this is that you should not adapt your calorie intake to account for 'calories used' number from a machine. You should listen to your body and adapt to its needs. It's not as cut and dry as taking the number of calories burnt from the treadmill and eating that much food to balance it out. Only you will know what is the right amount of food to lose weight and have enough energy to do exercise. 

Eat at a maintenance calories or more. NOT LESS. Ditch PPL and pick 5x5 Stronglifts back up, do the entire thing. If you follow 5x5 Stronglifts to the letter, you should achieve 5 reps of: 

Minor story detour before my answer. I am 5ft5, 80kg, and I work out regularly and have respectable lifting ability compared to the average joe. My friend is 80kg, 6ft and cannot lift their bodyweight in any lift. We did some archery last week, after half a hour I look over and my friend is struggling a lot to keep his shoulders level, chest flat, arms straight, etc. Afterwards we had a chat and he stated that it became really hard to fire the bow after about 15 minutes of doing the activity. I had no such trouble, I could have gone for another half a hour. The only difference was a bit of height and a lot of practice using muscles. You are correct, the answer is no. "To get good at doing X activity, DO X activity, a lot." Your muscle memory, strength and endurance will grow over time with continual practice. You body takes the easiest route to make any repeated activity require less work and cause less CNS stress. So you should be working out at a weight that is greater than your draw strength. Don't limit your lifting to your sport though, aim for big numbers! Focus on: 

Tidy the kitchen, clean it, sort out a rota if you need to. You cannot eat on a sensible budget in a healthy way without cooking. You need to take some time, each day, few days or week to prepare your food for the day. Get some Tupperware and plan out your meals using a calorie tracker (myfitnesspal or similar). Your meals should be ready to pick up from the fridge in the morning and should last you all day. Lunch: 

Aesthetics: I'm doing this to look good. I am pairing my exercise with a 10-15% calorie deficit to reduce my BF% from mid twenties to high teens. Balance: I want to achieve what I deem to be a balanced body. My squats and deadlifts are good for that of my goal bodyweight but my upper body is lagging. Improve my main lifts (Deadlift, Squat, Bench). 

I'm going to keep this as simple as possible. Hopefully some of these answers will help others in similar situations. 

Exercise should be challenging. Doing the same thing every time you go will result in your body doing the minimum to become efficient at that activity. You need to constantly move your goals as you get better at a activity. In beginner weightlifting most programs start at 20kg (bar only) and add 2.5/5kg every time you go in a linear fashion. This is the principle of progressive overload and it is proven to force your body to constantly do work and develop itself into a more muscular, lean (and good looking) machine. Body fat percentage. I can use myself as a great example here. I am 80kg, 5ft5 and male (look at my profile for my lifts). I work out 4 times a week lifting weights with a known program, track my macros and micros via myfitnesspal AND I was not losing weight. I checked my bodyfat last week and compared it with a long time ago when I was at the same weight and I found that I have gone from 32% down to 23% while maintaining the weight (same measurement technique). This may be the case for you, lots of beginners gain muscle and lose weight simultaneously. It was just my period of that got extended beyond my first 9 months of sustained lifting. 

Common Issues I can't push up! Are my arms too short? Should I use paralletes? No, your arms are not too short to do an L-sit. You just lack the ability to push down through the shoulders (depress the scapula), or to compress enough (see here for a demonstration of maximum compression)). The foot-supported L-sit from the progression will help with the former, compression work will help with the latter. My upper leg cramps up and hurts! What do I do? Massage it out and continue onwards. It'll get better with time. 

Special note: Trainers/PT's have one thing in mind, your wallet. In the vast majority of cases they are aiming to keep you coming to the gym so that you can keep paying them. They don't often care if you gain muscle or change your look, so long as you keep turning up and regularly paying them. You can learn literally everything you need to know about fitness by doing some reading, hit up reddit first. $URL$ 

There is a lot of praise for Push-Pull-Legs style routines where you have a session mainly "pulling" focusing on back and then next week you are "pushing", focusing on your back. I understand that working all muscle groups is important but what is the basis, scientific or otherwise around why PPL routines are deemed so successful compared to a simpler routine like Madcow or ICF? 

Lets review the impact of a PT/Coach in both: Competition-centric This is your Olympic weightlifting coach, baseball coach, football coach, running coach, etc. You are working in a competitive environment. A common term for this kind of person is "athlete". A coach does not commonly receive direct payment from a athlete, they often are paid through club membership. You have a coach for a few reasons: 

I have done a lot of legwork for you here, lets take a look at the meals mentioned in myfitnesspal's calorie checker: 

This is very subjective to your personal build. For a beginner to the concept of farmers walks: Male - 25kg, Female - 20kg (each hand) Use principle of progressive overload to steadily increase the weight to the maximum dumb/kettlebell you can use in your gym and then increase the volume of the exercise. Keep to 50-100ft for distance covererd 

Here is a link to a great warm-up which is recommended for people doing dips and pull-ups. There is also a video you can follow here: $URL$ 

Once you completed the above program, work out if you want to go for a "ripped" look or be strong af. And pick a suitable program accordingly. That is at least 6 months away. 

Everyone's hips are slightly different. Most people turn their toes out to ensure that their knee tracks over their toes. That said, squat stances can vary massively depending on type and sport: Powerlifting vs Olympic and the myriad of squat types: Safety Bar, Back Squat, Front Squat, Overhead Squat, Sissy Squat, Zercher Squat, Box Squat, High Bar, Low bar... Personally, I do lots of squatting and with nearly all of them I take a slightly different stance. I worked out my stance by following a 3 month linear progression on them to find what was comfortable. Keeping feet parallel and forwards puts a lot of pressure/torque on ankles and is not really efficient for holding extremely heavy loads as it can often lead to you shifting weight onto the outside edge of your foot, rather than centre/mid-foot. The opposite, toes out further than knees track causes torque on the knee joint. My advice is simple: Squat in a position that feels natural and reduces/eliminates knee pain without your knees caving in or your lower spine flexing. I'd recommend finding a safety squat bar if your gym has one, they can eliminate a lot of common issues with squatting when used correctly. 

It's a really general question so I'll keep my answer general by sticking my the sports-science mantra: 

Many more exist, go look for them. Snacks: Look for a place locally that sells fruit and dried nuts/berries (UK have Holland & Barret, whole foods, Bulk Powders on amazon). Work out portions of them, tupperware them, and snack on those. 

With reverse banded squats the total weight moved decreases as you get lower in your squat. With banded squats you start at an overloaded level. The main difference is how you load the bar, both are effective at helping you improve your lockout during the squat. With banded squats you load the bar with less weight overall to compensate the banding resistance. Reverse banded also means that you potentially will break your bands if you bail the bar. Physically both are similar but due to the assistance in stabilisation at the top I prefer to do them using normal banding method. 

Can you gain height after puberty? No. Can you gain height through exercise? No. Your bone structure determines your height and after puberty has passed, that is fixed. Get used to being the height you are, accept and embrace it. I'm 5ft 4in and I think its great. As for exercises to build muscle, do compound barbell movements building up to heavy weight with a linear progression (add 2.5lbs every time you go to the gym), go for 5 sets of 5: 

Muscle is lost when it is not used. Muscle mass can be reduced over time through lots of steady-state cardio but that requires months/years of effort. Muscle reduction due to 'cardio' is vastly overestimated by most. 

Of course you can. HIIT is very good for you and should be part of your normal workout regime. Your program of fitness sounds pretty good. 

The article continues, quoting Dr. Michael Schwartz, an obesity and diabetes researcher who is a professor of medicine at the University of Washington: 

Based on my earlier answer, we could group "cardio training" as medium intensity exercise and "fat burn" as high intensity. Based on a 40 minute session you are burning more calories over a high-intensity session than a medium intensity session. Therefore, you will lose more weight. Exersise.about.com gives some data on this: The chart below details the fat calories expended by a 130-pound woman during cardio exercise: 

By combining the above with eating less calories than you use up in a day you will lose weight and gain muscle mass (over 6 months to a year). Once you have completed either then you should know what you want to do and reset your personal goals. 

I'm going to stab in the dark and assume you are getting home-cooked-style meals (which usually have around a 20:40:40 protein, carb, fat macronutrient split). I don't need a calorie counter to tell you that you are cutting pretty hard with that diet, by restricting both fat and carb intake and trying to fill your calorie needs for the day through protein. This works (as you have no doubt found out) in helping you lose weight and gain some muscle (called re-composition). Problem is, if you are working out 7 days a week at a high intensity then you are going to run into fatigue pretty fast with that listed diet. You simply are running on "empty". Your lifting progression will stall, your running times will stall, you will feel tired all the time. Advice: 

I personally would cut out the swimming for now but you have explicitly said you want to do it, so if you do then do it on one of your rest days. 

A note about eating the same thing every day: This is a really easy way to ensure you are always hitting your calorie and macronutrient requirements, however, it is not for everybody. Some people will get bored with this method and their adherence can suffer as a result. Feel free to create multiple different meal plans for different days that all meet your nutritional requirements. 

You cannot expect a formula to be exactly right for you. The only way you will know what you need to eat (in terms of calories) to ensure that you can gain/maintain/lose weight is through experimenting yourself. Use Sedentry as a guide and then if you aren't losing weight, reduce calories and vice-versa. Problem with categorising exercise as absolute is thus: A comfortable 10k run for me uses around 1000 calories. I would class this is light/moderate activity, even though it is for 1 hour constantly. A crossfit class is 15-30 minutes of very high intensity but only burns around 400 calories. I would put that as hard/very hard exercise. I do crossfit 5 times a week and run 3-4 times. My daily calorie intake to maintain is around 2300 but that calculator suggests I should be eating 2800. I know that 2300 is right through experimenting aver the last year. To gain weight, you must eat more calories than you use. Increased exercise does help increase appetite for some people (as does other things like reducing caffeine intake) but you just need to take in more calories overall. For people with a low appetite, eating more is hard. You are sedentary by the tool you linked, a walk doesn't really 'count' as exercise like the tool suggests. The difference in metabolism from the norm you have suggested isn't really a truth. Just eat 1 pop-tart to compensate. 

I wrote this answer on another site so, disclaimer: I am copy-pasting my own work: How important is nutrient or meal timing? Under most circumstances and in the grand scheme of things, it's not critical. Of far greater importance is hitting your calorie, macro- and micro-nutrient needs over the course of the day. After that, consistency and commitment should be applied to an appropriate workout plan that suits your performance and/or body goals. If you tend to train in a fasted state, getting your post-workout nutrition in as soon as possible is a good idea, but the first two points (daily diet goals, consistent training) still take precedence. For a good paper reviewing the literature examining the ideas and research behind nutrient timing and the "post-workout window", check out this meta-review. For a review specific to protein timing and it's effect on strength and muscle building, check out this review. 

To get strong, lift heavy By constantly moving on you elevate your heart rate and fatigue takes over. Don't think of your muscles getting fatigue but instead think of your whole body. For example, deadlift and bench press use completely different muscle groups but you won't find anyone going to do a set of heavy deadlifts after a heavy bench set. What you are doing is basically circuit training, still a valid activity but you aren't going to "get strong". Your definition of strength may be different but most common one is "ability to move something heavy, once". Your routine develops muscular endurance. Which way is better for strength: do one type of training at once or rotate different ones and save time needed for resting (or neither)? Neither. You need compound movements, drop the machines and pick up a barbell. Squat, deadlift, press. 

Finally, on a personal note: It is clear your want to lose weight and gain muscle, and it is likely you can do this at your level. However, you need to make more sensible choices in diet and exercise if you want to achieve your goals: 

Personally/Anecdotally I like weighted planks a lot, I feel that they have helped develop my stabilization. I also like using them for smaller muscles: forearms, traps, calves.
