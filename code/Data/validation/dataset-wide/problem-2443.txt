When practicing insight meditation and when observing mental formations arising then sometimes shortly after another mental formation arises caused by the first mental formation. An example could be a memory that arises then shortly after another memory arises that is closely related to the first one. The second memory is clearly caused by the first one since its similar in appearance and "acts" like a continuation of the first memory. This picture is from Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma by Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi. The picture can be found in the chapter "Compendium of the cognitive process", at p. 155. It shows the different stages in the process of cognition. 

Here is a quote on the four ways to arahantship. The quote is from the book "In The Buddha's Words" by Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi, p. 268-269: 

It probably refers to the balancing of the Five Spiritual Faculties, especially Concentration (samadhi) and Energy (viriya). If the Energy faculty is unbalanced, leading to the 3rd Hindrance of Sloth and torpor (thina-middha), one needs to arouse energy. This can be done in a number of ways such as; 

The brahmin householders explain that they do not understand the phrase "unrighteous / righteous conduct and conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma" and ask the Buddha to further expound on his teaching. The Buddha then explains in details what unrighteous and righteous conduct in accordance with the Dhamma is: 

I stumbled upon this story about a 200 year old buddhist monk found in Mongolia where its claimed that he is not dead but instead in a very deep state of meditation. I have heard about dead meditating monks before where its been claimed that they are not really dead but in deep state of meditation. Here are some quotes from the story: 

Suicide is a concept. It belongs to conceptual reality. Nibbana is one of the four Ultimate Realities (Paramattha Sacca). 

Volitionally taking the life of another living being is only possible if one has defilements left. Killing is rooted in hatred (dosa). An enlightened being such as an Arahant or a Buddha has eradicated all defilements and fetters and are therefore not capable of killing since the unwholesome root is simply not there. 

Well, how we are born is due to past Kamma (among other natural laws as well). While that is said, Buddhism goes much deeper than the physical appearance, ones sexual orientation, political preferences etc. Buddhism is about ending suffering. Its about cultivating and purifying the mind and eventually becoming free from Samsara. One can practice the Path no matter what ones sexual orientation is. These things are not important. What is important, is the quality of mind in an individual. 

In the Samyutta Nikaya, The Buddha also mentions the Middle Way. Here in the "The Book of the Six Sense Bases": 

If one practices correctly and consistently, then one will not expect anything, because one has seen for oneself how expectation creates suffering and bondage. Expectation is a hindrance and produces suffering. Expectation should be observed and noted, with mindfulness in the present moment, thereby using the hindrance to cultivate insight. 

The nature of Dukkha will become very clear when practicing insight meditation. One will come to see that conditioned phenomena are unsatisfying due to them being impermanent. It is likened to a glass cup with a little, almost invisible crack in it. That glass is in a process of breaking up already when it has come into existence. Or a bridge where the pillars have tiny cracks in them. From far away the bridge look solid but when taking a closer look, the pillars are breaking up, soon to fall apart. Mahasi Sayadaw likened the break up of conditioned phenomena, here the physical body, to a dilapidated house that can come down at any time. All conditioned phenomena are dukkha because they do not last and they are uncontrollable, since one cannot make them stay any longer just because one wants them to. Likewise painful phenomena will not go away just because one wants them to. If you want to understand this in the deepest way, you have to practice insight meditation and see this with your own eyes. 

These imponderables the Buddha advices not to contemplate since they will only serve to agitate and destabilize the mind making it less suitable for practice. 

You could treat it as you would do in Vipassana meditation, i.e. to treat all physical and mental objects the same way. You can also use it to further deepen your practice. If you have increased time and energy, you could practice Dana and do e.g. volunteer work. Its really up to you. The Buddha taught that one should do good, practice the Dhamma and lead a pure life. 

I think the questions you ask are important and very broad. You might consider splitting them up or keeping only the first question "What exactly is Jhana?". I will point you to some of the litterature where you can find answers on your own. Here its important to couple the studying with practice or else you will not really understand what Jhana is. You will only understand it intellectually which is like only being able to peek through the door while practicing insight meditation is like opening the door and walking into the room. Or like the onion-simile. Intellectual knowledge will only allow you to penetrate the top layer while experiental knowledge gained through insight meditation will allow you to penetrate into the deepest layers and the core. I suggest you check out; The Visuddhimagga on p. 131-162 the Jhanas are treated. The Jhanas and the Lay Disciple According to the Pali Suttas by Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi. Here Bhikkhu Bodhi goes through the Jhanas, Right Concentration, Stream Entry and other important stuff related to Jhanas. Meditation lecture by Bhikkhu Bodhi. Here Bhikkhu Bodhi talks about both Vipassana & Samatha meditation and explains the 5 hindrances and the Jhanas. I think this lecture is very good and any meditator would learn a lot by listening to this talk. A Critical Analysis of the Jhanas by Henepola Gunaratana. Here is an analytical study of the Jhanas. It goes through the hindrances and the Jhanas. Lanka 

In Samsara, the conditioned reality, everything exists due to causes and conditions. Mental and physical phenomena are constantly arising and ceasing. They are ever-changing, uncontrollable and oppressive. All conditioned phenomena follows a certain "order or recipe". I have made a drawing to illustrate this process. What can be seen here is that phenomena has 3 phases, i.e. Arising - Presence - Dissolution: Click on photos for full size 

This acinteyya discusses the origin of the cosmos but i think the question about the origin of the intention that must give rise to the forming of a mental formation, here a choice, might fall into the same category. Why is that? It is similar to be searching for a "first cause". A first cause complicates the entire picture. One can then ask what caused the first cause? Or what caused the cause that caused the first cause? And so to infinity. It will not give a satisfying answer, unless one is a Buddha. If one is not, then it will only leave the mind agitated and stressed out which is not conducieve to practice. 

I read that one could start sleeping 1-2 hours in sitting posture and then move to a lying posture. Then slowly increase the time sleeping in sitting posture while reducing the time spent sleeping in lying posture. Thank you for your time. 

The rule says that it is an offence to eat food that is not given. There might be other rules and canonical references too. I just do not have knowledge about them. 

Meditation can definitely cause you to sleep less. When meditating one is naturally entering a calmer state of mind. When doing Samatha meditation one is temporarily suspending the hindrances thereby limiting the effect of worries, excessive thinking, restlessness, cravings, aversions, anger etc. This naturally leads to a more simple and unified mind. Such a mind will affect the physical body and calm it down. The human brain uses more energy than both arms and legs together on e.g. cognitive processes. All the stress from the hindrances will sooner or later manifest itself in the physical body as stress, i.e. an increased secretion of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenalin. This will create a lot extra tension and load on the internal organs which in turn will increase the demand for energy. The result of that is the need for more sleep. Now if one removes the above things then one naturally needs less sleep. If we take a look at Vipassana Meditation then here we are directly working with the hindrances, i.e. by weakening them to the point where they can be eradicated completely. In vipassana meditation we learn to see reality for what it is, meaning that the mind do not extrapolate on phenomena. The mind do no follow after phenomena thereby launching a process of ideation and planning on how to posess the object. A non-meditator, i.e. the untrained mind will not have this ability to see clearly. The untrained mind will see an object for a brief moment whereafter it will launch the process of ideation, extrapolation, judging, imagining, liking, disliking etc. Imagine how much energy these cognitive processes demand. If one trains in clear comprehension one gradually builds the ability to stop the mind from launching these cognitive processes by applying mindfulness to mental and physical phenomena as they arise and cease. With time and training the mind will become deeply rooted in the present. It will become calm, peaceful and equanimous no matter what arises. A reduction in mental stress levels results in the physiological processes of secretion of stress hormones will be stopped and reversed resulting in a calmer body and a lot less load on internal organs. At night the body regrows tissue, builds muscle and bone and strengthens the immune system. When there is less load on the body then it also needs less time for restitution, i.e. less time to sleep. 

For more information on this topic there is a comprehensive and detailed exposition called "The Fourfold Analytical Knowledge in Pali Literature" by Ven. Bhikkhu Kusalaguṇa. Here is a quote from the abstract: 

Kamma is actually Fourfold. Take a look at the picture i have attached. It shows the four aspects of kamma, i.e. Function, Ripening, Time of Ripening and Place of Ripening. Click on photos for full size 

As seen in the illustration below, the Arahant is free from the 5 lower fetters and the 5 higher fetters. When a fetter has been broken it does not come back. It is done away with for good. It is permanently destroyed. So to answer your question: No, an arahant cannot loose his attainment. 

Of course. Through the practice of Insight meditation the mark of impermanence becomes visible. It can be seen in all conditioned phenomena, e.g. the breath. Try to observe the in/out-breath and you will see impermanence on a gross level.. 

Good question. I do not have an answer to that. I would think that it's the same opinion, since we are dealing with the root defilements. I might be wrong about this though.
