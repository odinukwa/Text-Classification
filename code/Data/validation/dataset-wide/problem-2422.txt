So as you can see there is no escape, let me provide an example from Lord Buddha...... "A normal being (a one who hasn't reach Nirvana) is like a skinned cow which lives,if it stand birds attack it,if it go into the water fish attach it,If it lay on the ground worms attack it. Like this there is no escape for a normal one he is always driven by his six senses burning in lust hate and confusion." So where does the bliss comes from? imagine if you can be free from these three,it will be absolute freedom and peace wouldn't it? So imagine an Arahant.... He has no burning caused by those three,he is in bliss of peace.So is it only when he is alive? No,Look at yourself you are not only burning from the fires of this life you are burning from the fires of last lives let me explain.... Don't you have a fear about what karma would bring tomorrow? 

There is a belief in my country that Miscarriages & Natural abortions can happen as a result of evil beings taking revenge from someone. I recently heard a story from a teacher of mine that some couple visited him about a series of Miscarriages because they had a suspicion about it. He is a Famous monk in my country and he does not have any reputation for doing such Exorcism stuff, But as a monk he could not turn two troubled people away so he started reciting dhamma hoping something would come up. As my teacher said then the lady started acting strange and like in those movies she talked like a completely another person. My teacher said that she told them the story's beginning. So long story short ; she was pregnant in the earlier part of their marriage and they did not wanted a child back then so they took an abortion and that dead child is now haunting them as a being from Yakkha or Pretha realm. 

I have seen how some Sutras / Suttas start with an open invitation to many beings to come and hear the words of the Lord. Now this makes sense as it was a teaching given by Lord Buddha to his followers.But now the times have changed "Pali" as a language is dead. It gave birth to many new languages and died in the process. So today we say the same suttas and some keep it original and some use their own translation. 

Is there any explanation that you can find? Has such events happened in recent history in any other Buddhist countries,monasteries or events? 

Remember these words from Lord Buddha, "Vinnana" is like a seed, attachment or craving is like water and Karma is the land. Because your mind wander and get attached it creates Karma. Whatever you get attached to,you soon start to crave for it. There it is The land,the water and the seed, because of this you are born and will be born. Practice to focus on the temporary nature of things and use your knowledge to see and feel the world not your body. practice to keep away from the 3 phases mentioned above. Mindfulness Lord Buddha taught was keeping mind from those 3 phases mentioned above and maintaining your life and the very second you live in on 8 noble ways. 

As you know democracy is really new,what existed before is a cast system with nobles and lower casts. Your name sounds Indian so i presume there is no need of explaining the difficulties that a lower cast person will have to go through to get to any higher level in anything. At the age of kings there is no better place to get accepted than being born as a prince and that's why it happened like that in this era. 

So what to learn from this? Animals can hear dhamma and if they listen and liked it it would generate good and powerful karma that can get them out of lower realms and to higher realms. So if you want to help your animal... Recite dhamma in a very distinct and nice tone. recite them so nicely that it would be attractive to anyone nearby. This would generate good Karma to you and to your dog as it listens. But talking would not work because dogs can't understand it. But if you do Meththa meditation it will effect anyone in any place including all forms of life. That is a sure fire way to communicate goodness to any being. 

As you know Prince "Siddhartha" (the prince who became our Lord Buddha) gave up all hopes of life and started his journey towards understanding. Let me tell you about how extreme that will was, Before giving up all food Lord Buddha ate only one "Mung" seed per day. The reason why this rule was given has two sides.... If monks try to grow their own food and consume two questions arise. They will have to waste valuable hours to do the whole farming thing that they could use to further the path if there was no growing. The other reason is they will obviously be drawn to grow what they like to eat and that will not help their path (Because of it feeding the attachment to taste). And every time a Monk consume temple grown food that would be a chance lost to a lay person to gain some good karma. 

Good idea but be mindful because in sometime your mind will feed your ego with "I am faster" feeling and you mind end up trying to listen or read faster than you should. That can cause some harm because i have seen that sometimes it is better to listen slower when learning certain teachings. And as Lord Buddha advised you should listen to things you have already learnt again and again because sometimes even if you know something going over and over makes you realize a whole another side of it. 

Once you reach the first step in the path "Sovan / Sothapanna" your Faith / Shraddha can't be shaken by anything. 

There is a common misinterpretation of what "Mindfulness" truly is, my school teach us differently and the form you are mentioning is "Not so effective" as to my teacher. So here is what we have learned as Mindfulness..... 

What science see as a disorder is something that is a bit far from what is normally accepted.But as Buddhists we try to change our mindset with meditation.It actually changes the brain structure. Mindfulness Can Literally Change Your Brain So a changed brain will not work like a normal one. It will most certainly behave in different set of rules.This would justify stories like the one above. 

Explanation of marked words above. *Meththa Samadhi** -* Samadhi is a state of mind in which the chaotic state of the mind has been stopped by a meditation. Mettha samadhi is reaching it with Meththa meditation *Non-human beings** -* Non-Human beings are Brahmas,Devas,Animals,Asuras and beings in lower realms *Die with proper consciousness** -* This means when the person dies he/she will not be dying with fear,anger,hate,greed or any other corrupting state of mind.The person will die with the knowledge of death and will be conscious enough to revisit the learning of dhamma *Brahmas** -* *Brahmas are at the peak of life.They are even above the "Devas" and they are actually the highest that any normal being can reach without the help of dhamma.Birth in this realm happens only to beings with "Samadhi".They hold the highest life expectancy of all beings (Unfortunately our number system will not have a number to match it). *Sangha** -* The holy monks. 

Here you have lost Compassion and you show no regard to the lives of these ants, now this is bad. This kind of action will generate bad karma. But there's a catch.... Say you knew about the ants and walked on the grass thinking "Hopefully there won't be any now". And you did not saw any for a moment and suddenly you see that you have stepped on some.Now you panic and try to walk away from the ants but you are surrounded.So you quickly step away trying your best to not to harm any ants. Here when you try to walk away you might increase the amount of dead ants but you still have no idea of a killing or hurting.Strangely even after many dead ants you are still clean. 

So how to recognize something gone wrong? Buddhism's advice on that is to have a well experienced teacher who can understand and help. I must say that this person must be a Monk because a lot of times people who advice their friends on meditation get carried away by their ego and give misguided advice. 

Practice these meditations while doing your day to day stuff and before you know it you will be a good practitioner,This is how i got over the issue my self. May triple gems bless you! 

You can Continue the practice of this meditation in the new way and note that the older way is limited to a country or two now. 

A similar question occurred in Lord Mind's too. Lord Buddha in search of the beginning looked back into the past of Lord's own samsara. This should go with the saying that among all the beings who can recall previous lives, lord Buddha is the most skilled in that task. With that ability no one matches lord Buddha in speed and the amount of lives visible. Lord Buddha addressed monks and said, It is a waste of time to look back to seek a beginning, even with the ability of a Buddha. I have looked back for eons and what I've seen is not even a fraction. Samsara is too long to look back and find a beginning. Buddhism does not teach of a beginning of a samsara and refuse to answer it because of the search for that question is not with a foreseeable end. That itself is the reason that Buddhism teach beings to not to be late, not to postpone the path. Because it is very long and the end of all suffering is not possible without Nirvana. Namo Buddhaya! 

I've heard even though two people do the same good Karma their returns can be different on what they were thinking. And when coming to effect these different Karmas can give different births ("Trihethuka pratisandhi") to the beings who did those Karma Unlocking or Locking the ability to realize Nirvana in that life itself. Can someone explain how Birth Karma effect a being? 

Bandha Piritha - Extending Meththa towards the casts of snake kings. I heard this way.... Once Lord Buddha was residing in the Jethavana Monastery of noble Anepidu. A monk died because of a snake bite.A lot of monks came to Lord Buddha, they worshiped Lord Buddha and sat down.They asked about the monk who died because of the snake bite. Lord Buddha answered. Fortunate monks,That monks did not extended his "Meththa" toward the casts of the snake kings.If he did he would't have been bit by a snake. What are those four casts of snake kings? One is called "Virupaksha" One is called "Erapatha" One is called "Jabyapuththa" One is called "Kanha Gothamaka" That monks did not extended his "Meththa" toward these casts of the snake kings.If he did he would't have been bit by a snake. Fortunate monks, I approve extending Meththa towards these Royal casts of snakes.That will be a security and a protection for you.Also it will be a Meththa chant for you. Lord Buddha said this afterwards,
