In fact, setting $$\begin{align} r &= \frac{d}{2} & r_1 &= \frac{|HL|}{2} & R &= |LE| \\ L &= (r_1,0) & H &= (-r_1,0) & E &= (x,y) \end{align}$$ we get the cartesian hyperbola equation $$\frac{x^2}{r^2} - \frac{y^2}{r_1^2-r^2} = 1$$ and in polar coordinates, viewed from $L$: $$R = \frac{r_1^2 - r^2}{r - r_1\cos\alpha}$$ For very large $R/r_1$, $|\alpha|$ must be very close to its asympotic limit: $$\begin{align} \cos\alpha &\approx \frac{r}{r_1} = \frac{d}{|HL|} = \frac{t_{ELH}}{t_{HL}} \\ \text{where}\quad t_{HL} &= \frac{|HL|}{c} \approx 10.0\cdot 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{s} \qquad\text{(time directly from $H$ to $L$)} \end{align}$$ In 3D this means that $E$ lies on one of the two sheets of a hyperboloid of revolution whose axis of revolution is the line $HL$. In particular, in $L$'s view of the sky, partially hidden under the horizon, there should be a fairly thin circular band that covers all projected candidate points for $E$. The solid angle of view enclosed by the circular band is $$ A_{\text{ste}} = 2\pi(1 - \cos\alpha) \approx 2\pi\left(1 - \frac{t_{ELH}}{t_{HL}}\right)$$ Uncertainties in $t_{ELH}$ yield uncertainties in $\cos\alpha$ which widen the circular band. Thus the circle becomes an annulus. The solid angle of view covered by that annulus measures $$\begin{align} A_{\text{ste.max}} - A_{\text{ste.min}} = 2\pi(\cos\alpha_{\text{min}} &{}- \cos\alpha_{\text{max}}) \approx 2\pi\frac{t_{ELH\text{.max}} - t_{ELH\text{.min}}}{t_{HL}} \\ \text{briefly:}\quad \Delta A_{\text{ste}} &\approx 2\pi\frac{\Delta t_{ELH}}{t_{HL}} \end{align}$$ Substituting reported data for $t_{ELH}$, with $\text{min}$ and $\text{max}$ referring to 90% probability intervals, we have: $$\begin{array}{rcrrr} \text{entity} & \text{unit} & \text{nom} & \text{min} & \text{max} & \Delta \\\hline t_{ELH} & 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{s} & 6.9 & 6.5 & 7.4 & 0.9 \\ \cos\alpha & 1 & 0.69 & 0.65 & 0.74 & 0.09 \\ 90^\circ - \alpha & {}^\circ & 44 & 41 & 48 & 7 \end{array}$$ And thus the annulus, when projected to a unit (celestial) sphere, covers $$\Delta A_{\text{ste}} \approx 0.18\pi \approx (1.9\cdot10^3)^{\circ\circ}$$ (The ${}^{\circ\circ}$ means square degrees.) In contrast, the reported value of the credible region varies between $140^{\circ\circ}$ (50% probability) and $590^{\circ\circ}$ (90% probablity). This is because large parts of the annulus could be ruled out based on additional information such as signal strength ratios. But those refinements are not the topic of this thread. For easier visualization, let us move to a point $B$ on Earth's surface where the center of the annulus is in the zenith, and the annulus itself is at constant altitude $90^\circ - \alpha$, as given in the above table. To that end, let $O$ be the location of Earth's center and require that the 3D ray $OB$ points in the same direction as the ray $HL$. This determines the latitude and longitude of $B$. Note that the parallel shift from $HL$ to $OB$ incurs a parallax, but that is negligible because the distance to $E$ is so large. Idealizing our planet to a sphere and doing the calculations (transforming the locations of $H$ and $L$ from spherical coordinates to cartesian coordinates, computing the difference vector, normalizing it, and transforming back to spherical coordinates), I find $B$ to be at $$B\colon\ 27^\circ 21'54.22''\mathrm{S}\ 38^\circ 36'33.45''\mathrm{W} = 27.365061^\circ\mathrm{S}\ 38.609293^\circ\mathrm{W}$$ which is some 700km southeast of Rio de Janeiro in the Atlantic. If you had been there at and had spun around yourself, drawing a band at constant altitude $90^\circ - \alpha \approx 44^\circ$ and width $7^\circ$ in the sky, that would have marked all the directions where the signal source $E$ could have been. To get the sky view simulated, I have written a tiny script for Nightshade: 

First of all it has to be stated that it is difficult to have a scientific discussion about multiple universes. The problem with multiple universes is that it can be logically deducted from assumptions and hypotheses, but not tested nor empirically verified. This makes discussions around this topic, like string theory, highly "religious". There are different multiverse theories coming from cosmology, physics and philosophy. One of the theories comes from the cosmological theory of cosmic inflation. Cosmic inflation states that there are always fluctuations on the microscopic level and this results in energy waves that can form into matter and anti-matter pairs. The cosmic inflation now states that at the beginning of our universe there was a cosmological constant or a big vacuum that is by nature unstable and caused the microscopic fluctuations to happen on a cosmic size and thus resulted in a rapid expansion of the early universe. This cosmic inflation is a variation of the (hot) big bang theory, that explains a number of observations in the universe that are not explained by the (hot) big bang theory. What it doesn't explain is that if I have an energy fluctuation at microscopic level, it can happen that this energy wave splits into two matter pairs or an anti-matter/matter pair. Later these pairs annihilate each other and what has happened at microscopic level evens out on macroscopic level. However, when particles appear at microscopic level, what needs to happen to let these particles exist for a longer time to have stars evolve from this matter. Now back to the multiple universes. The going theory now is that if such a thing can happen to our universe, such a thing can happen in the endless vastness that contains our universe and multiple universes can start and exists next to each other. These multiple universes might also explain that when I have a cosmic fluctuation, I have two universes that come into existence. One with the matter and one with the nati-matter. Bear in mind!!!! These are all philosophical hypotheses and none of it can be verified, falsified or empirically tested. If I now have made it logically possible to have multiple universes coming from different cosmic fluctuations, I can now have different universes. For instance, I can have for each matter universe a corresponding anti-matter universe to get the energy balance evened out. Now if I have several universes with each different compositions, I can also have universes where, at least, the laws of nature apply differently. In a universe without dark matter, laws of physics apply differently. Whether the "laws of nature" are totally different in other universes, is difficult to scientifically proof. Especially with theories that are build on our laws of nature. When you think we're already on thin ice here, philosophers can make it even more unreal. If I have cosmic fluctuations that can happen under different circumstances, which result in universes with different compositions that then have a different application of the laws of nature, I can equally well argue that there will be universes where certain laws of nature don't exists, while there are some particles that don't exist in that universe. So, to answer your question briefly, there are theories that say there are other universes that have different laws of nature. However, multiverse theories are highly speculative and are difficult to proof. So, whether these theories are right, we'll probably will never know. 

I'm looking for some form of "rough and ready" formula to convert between redshift z value, years since BB, and distance, so that when I read an astronomy paper and it discusses an event that occurred at z=10+/-0.5, or a quasar at z=7, I can get a rough idea when the event occurred and how far away they are saying the quasar is, as context. I'm aware that this is an inherently vague question, since the times and distances depend on the model and convention chosen, and also that I'm not specifying proper distances/comoving coordinates, etc. My assumption is that most current models and their parameters, that are mainstream accepted and used, will be based on very similar parameters of very similar models (if not the same model), such as latest Planck parameters, or similar. They might differ more due to assumptions about very early times, but redshift is inherently >~380 k years, and if they did vary a lot for times beyond that timeframe, we'd have real issues. In other words, I suspect/hope that any differences in answers due to model variation, won't significantly change the answer to this question. So the only question will (hopefully) be, which convention or type of metric/distance will be appropriate. If an assumption needs making (such as the meaning of 'distance' to be applied, or the zero point used for time: BB or end of inflation etc) please make an assumption most likely to help me, and I'll edit the question to clarify if needed, once I see what is too vague in the question as initially worded. Thank you ! 

To answer this, let's look at the next few billion/trillion/quadrillion/? years, and get a sense of the size of our galaxy and its central black hole. The first thing that happens related to your question, is that our galaxy and Andromeda collide and merge. This happens in some billions of years. When galaxies merge, the combined galaxy exists, but may have a different form, merged central black holes, and stars (or in some cases even one or both black holes) may be flung out of the combined galaxy. But the galaxy will endure, in some form or other. That's because a galaxy isn't held together by its central black hole. A sense of scale: mass In our galaxy, the central BH has a mass of about 4 -4.5 million suns. A bigger part is the stars, gas, and other ordinary baryonic matter (some hundreds of billions of stars, although many are red dwarfs and smaller than our sun). The ordinary matter is estimated to be about 600 billion suns,or about 150,000 times the mass of the central black hole. But the biggest part is dark matter. Explained simply, even taking into account all of the above mass, the galaxy still wouldn't be massive enough to rotate as it does. Calculations show that about 85% of all matter in our galaxy is "dark matter" - a type of matter that isn't made of ordinary atoms, but is suspected to be made of particles that can't interact much except through gravity (so we can't detect it through radiation, it doesn't form planets, stars or black holes, etc). Dark matter would be about 3.5 trillion suns, or about 850,000 times the mass of the central BH. So the total mass (ordinary + dark matter) is about 4 trillion suns or about a million times the mass of the central black hole. A sense of scale: diameter Considering size rather than mass, the central BH is perhaps the size of Uranus' orbit (about 12 light hours diameter). The visible galaxy is about 100,000 light years diameter, or about 70 million times the BH size. The extent of the dark matter halo is less certain (and has less of a defined edge), but depending on which research is right, may extend between 500,000 and 1 million light years diameter, or something along those lines (from memory), or a little under half a billion times the BH size. Summary The central BH contains about a millionth (0.0001%) of the galaxy's mass, and about 2 billionths (0.0000002%) of its diameter. So the central black hole is actually, and oddly, almost insignificant in terms of our galaxy's present-day structure. It might have been crucial for the formation of the galaxy, but that was long, long ago. It's not the current reason we rotate, and its not the reason we stay in galactic orbit. If it vanished or was ejected tomorrow, nothing at all would change except for a comparatively few stars in the galactic centre that directly orbit the BH. We're nowhere near there. We are in a spiral arm. The bottom line is, if the central BH vanished or left our galaxy, we and our descendants wouldn't ever notice, except for a change in X-ray emissions from that region (as detected by radio telescopes), and a few very faint stars in that region moving slightly differently over the millennia. That's all. But as other answers explain, a black hole takes an immense time to evaporate, so in reality, two things will happen: 

I don't think the title of your question and your question are really in sync here and I'm not sure I will correctly answer your question. However, I will give it a try. To give you a hint of the conclusion. My answer would be, "NO". There are several clues / reasons why I come to this answer. 

So, to get back to your second part of the question, "massless gravity", this is not a viable alternative. Gravity exists either by massive objects exchanging gravitons and therefore exercizing gravity upon each other, or a massive object "denting" the fabric of space / time and therefore creating a gravity field. In either case gravity cannot be seen as a farce that exists without the existence of mass. Secondly, to the first part of your question. Whether we can observe objects directly or indirectly, this doesn't make it more or less realistic. Dark matter is generally accepted to be there. We just haven't found a way to measure it. We can only see that the visible matter in the universe can't explain the gravitational pull on the visible matter and therefore we assume there is some other matter out there we haven't been able to "see". Hence, dark matter. However, dark matter does interact through gravity and our current successes in measuring gravitational waves might also result in a better understanding of gravity and how to measure the effect of dark matter on the gravitational pull in the universe. So, to answer your question: "No, we call dark matter because we can only observe it through its influence on other matter due to gravity. There is no such thing as gravity without mass."
