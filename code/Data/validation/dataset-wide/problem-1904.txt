After you asked your coworker out, only thing you could have done to not look bad afterwards is not get her discharged after she rejected you and even that could be viewed as non-professional. Even if your coworker accepted your advances you would either both be in a professionally bad place if you gave positive review, or in a romantically bad place and possibly professionally too if you gave bad review. What happens if you give bad review after coworker rejected you, this you already know. While office romances are generally treacherous grounds, there's literally NO WAY things could have ended happily once you asked her out while being the one responsible for her keeping her job. Live with the consequences and try to learn from them, hopefully you have a reputation for integrity and honesty and people accept your version of events at your word. If you don't have such a reputation, you'd do well to build one. 

and a good company needs all of them, in a balance that depends on the kind of work your company does. Putting the wrong kind of developer on the wrong kind of project will delay the project and disrupt relations with the developer. The advice "to be blunt" - and to attempt to shoehorn a wrong person in the wrong place - is only correct if there's no possibility of a swap with another team so that both teams are better off, and if you believe the person is capable to make this transition. To be poetic, you might have a bird on your team, and you're frustrated because it runs badly. On the other hand, if your company has no use for birds and will not have use in the near future, your duty is clear. 

They are government employees. Expect it to be pretty laid back. Not that you won't have work to do, and probably some kind of performance matrix. But usually this is just documentation that most government agencies have to keep to justify how and why tax dollars are being spent. 

One aspect that most everyone that have replied seem to have missed is that you applied and interviewed for a government job. You didn't specify which branch of government you applied for, or which and if it was Federal or State government. I have worked for state government off and on over the years and currently work for the Tax Commission for the state I live in. So as a government employee let me try to help you out... First you seem to have some ideals about what working in the real world is gonna be like. And from your post I get the sense that you are making some kind of life-long commitment. And maybe you are, Working for Government can be a pretty good gig in a lot of cases. You're basically guaranteed a paycheck and and the benefits packages are awesome. The downside is the hourly rate is less, and your work is well defined by your position so your work is gonna be in a narrow scope. In the private sector, your work is usually far more fluid based on what the company needs and/or client. In government, if something different is needed, they usually run to the legislature to ask for a budget. There is a lot of waste. In the private sector, the whole goal is to get things done with as small of a budget as possible. In government, the motivation of management is to get as big of a budget as possible. Also, if an agency does not use their entire budget they typically loose it. I've seen agencies blatantly waste money to keep from loosing their budget or a portion of their budget in the future. They want the argument that they spent all their money and that they need the same level of funding or more. Usually when a government agency opens a position, a small committee is formed to hire someone new. In most cases, I see 2 or 3 supervisors/managers from a department make up the committee. Sometimes larger, sometimes smaller depending on the size of the agency and a variety of other factors. I have been involved in these hiring committees a handful of times. We make a list of questions to ask during the interview. Sometimes we do open it up at the end for the interviewee to ask questions. And then we are done. So the interview process is very structured. far more structured than what it is in the private sector. That has been my experience. 

I would be genuinely surprised if the problem is actually the software and you get past step 1. Software is rarely the problem, the associated changes are, like:"Why do I have to write something down I didn't have to write down before?" 

This question is about passion and what does make you tick. Is your personality more on the worker drone side, do you thrive on money or power, do you take pride on having something accomplished? You should be passionate, but not fanatic, about something. It should also be something rather specific, not too generic. There is no perfect answer, because it needs to match the job. It needs to be something where the interviewer can check the box:"This matches the job we offer." 

Whether something is ethical or not is always also based on the culture you are in. As I don't know the culture in India, I can only tell you the culture in Germany. For a data collection to be ethical, it must follow some core requirements: 

I doubt the person or persons interviewing you would even know what that means. Depends if the position you interviewed for is a position that was just created, or if they are filling an existing position. I would still argue that those facilitating the interview was given the task by someone to find the best candidate possible. ...not really knowing anything about software development. 

This varies from agency to agency. My job gives me access to the building from 6am - 6pm Monday - Friday. The state that i work in does not allow state employees to work more than 10 hours a day. So I can work 4 10's if I want. Basically I have to get my 40 hours in between 6 am and 6 pm and between Monday and Friday. Most people I work with choose to work 7am - 3:30pm, including me. But I could go in at 6am if I wanted, or in as late as 9:30am... Any suggestions on what I should do? Obviously you were at the top of the list or they wouldn't have offered you the job. Sometimes government jobs don't attract the best talent as private sector positions are usually higher paying. But as I mentioned before, it is stable work and usually have awesome benefits. Guess it depends on your personality and what you want. But fresh out of school, I can't see where you could go wrong. Government jobs can be good resume builders. Also something to remember is the fact that your degree is basically a sideshow to your job. For example, where I work for the tax commission, a new programmer coming in and working for the agency would likely spend the next 4 months or so learning about tax law and tax rules. We use that as a basis for writing our rules to check for fraudulent returns, etc. So your employer is expecting that you will have a steep learning curve about the public service the agency provides before you can even begin writing a software application around those services. 

You should try to differentiate between skill, public knowledge and company knowledge. Let's say you developed a special automated warehouse software which saved 50% of time and costs. The fact that your old company has this software is company knowledge, also the fact that it works like a charm - nobody outside the company would know it. So this is a complete no-go area - already informing your new superior that their warehouse software is outdated, is asking for trouble. Now, your old company starts to not only use it, but sells it and advertises it. Now your new employer might give you the task to come up with a new warehouse software - then you can write a new software which also saves 50% of time and costs, because how to achieve this, is your skill you have gained and you can use any public knowledge. Most knowledge is publicly available, including patents. Off-limits is knowledge that resulted from company-specific research efforts. 

What has fairness to do with it? He does not ask you to contribute to it in your spare time or you will lose your job, does he? You get paid for contributing to the project. 

Depends how big the agency is. Could be few to a lot. If it is a larger agency you might find yourself in meetings deciding how things should be done or part of committees from several individuals that want to provide input and wish lists of features for the project you are working on. 

It's government. When was the last time you went to a government agency to try to take care of some personal business? Been to the Post office to mail a letter? How long did you have to stand in line? Did the person behind the counter care you were standing in line? Alternatively, how long did you stand in line at the grocery store? See the difference? 

In a government job, most likely not. The agency has a staffing budget, and they cannot usually go over that budget without robbing from another agency. For example, yesterday was the 15th of April. The Tax Commission I work for received over 150,000 returns yesterday that need to process...and I am here writing this response from home. It will take us about 8 weeks to process those tax returns and no one is working overtime. It could take 6 months and we don't care. We get paid the same either way. And to some degree, there is some incentive to drag it out. If it takes too long to process, my boss can say hey, we need a larger budget. And then he could advocate that he needs a raise because he is now managing a larger department with more resources. If I was in the private sector and this much business suddenly came in the door, I would probably be working 15 hours a day to get the orders filled to generate revenue for the company. In many ways, government is run completely opposite of the private sector. 

The first contracts were contracts for a specific work, commissions. "You make a chair for me and I pay you for the finished chair." There was no concept of raises. You had to finish the work in order to get paid. From there the service contracts started - "I need so many chairs per week, that it's easier for both of us to pay you for a whole week instead of per chair." This deal had benefits for both, if both were honest (wo)men. The very moment demand for chairs becomes stable for both parties, it's beneficial to extend the service contract duration. So, back to the topic, a raise is merely the re-negotiation of a contract. In theory, our carpenter could have negotiated a new price for every chair - but the commissioner, too. But both are not lawyers - they don't make money negotiating, they make money working. If they negotiate a day about the price for a chair, there is no chair made for a day. The benefits of a stable price outweigh the advantages - reliable income and reliable supply are the top concerns for both parties in any business, after all, reliable supply again means reliable income for the commissioner. If you compare employment culture in different countries, you will see that your concept is reality in other countries. India f.e. has a high percentage of work as commissions, the demand is much less stable - so you also have a high fluctuation of workers, which is not much different from a high fluctuation of wages. Employing a new human is for sure not less administrative or technical work than changing his salary. Therefore I believe the premise that technology did shape the culture is not tenable. The culture did shape the technology - the concept of steady re-negotiations is completely detrimental to the concept of steady employment, so there was no real need to develop specialized technology or processes for it. EDIT: "We just do it annually." or "It takes so long to get pay raises approved" are variations of "We are not lawyers, we don't make money negotiating". It takes long to get things approved because the people in the chain prefer to do things that they feel is their job (even if approving raises is their job). Remember, that HR and managers are already overhead. The commissioner and the carpenter don't need a HR department or manager to create and sell chairs. Note that technology can't do magic - a human still has to tell the software who gets a raise, starting when and how much, if you talk about performance-based raises. And, you usually keep the overhead as low as possible, so the current HR staff is exactly as many people as you must have for the work you already have. You are much more likely to have a second carpenter than a second accountant. If you start with "I did a great job this month, I want more money." the first conceptional counter-argument would be "Can we lower your salary when your job performance decreases next month in case your wife divorces you?" and then the employee has two choices: If he says yes, he basically switched his service contract back into a contract of commissions. He gets paid by what he delivers. If he says no, you see that it is just a re-negotiation of the whole contract. The employee is a hypocrite (not meant offensive), who wants the benefits of the steady employment with the benefits of commissioned work - the carpenter, who wants more money if he delivers more chairs, but doesn't want less money if he delivers less chairs. The annual raise is popular, because human culture is based upon a year in time-keeping. We measure time in years and seasons if we can - quarters of a year are much more used than thirds, although there is no reason why 4 months is worse than 3 months. A year divided in three chunks feels - wrong. If you do annual raises, you could also do raises every 11 months. There is no technological or administrative barrier that prevents it, it is a cultural one. If a culture would glorify the number 11, it might have 11-month raises though. The next numbers that looks reasonable for a raise seem to be 9 month or 6 months, right? But your SAP HR application doesn't care, it will do 8 months, too. It's culture, not technology that came up with these numbers. So, the two cultural barriers are the culture of time-keeping and the concept of steady employment. The more I move from annual raises to shorter terms, the more I turn the contract into a non-beneficial situation for me as employer - not getting the benefits of service contracts and not getting the benefits of commissioned work. It's not a big technological or administrative barrier - it's a puzzle and the pieces just won't fit together nicely with monthly raises.
