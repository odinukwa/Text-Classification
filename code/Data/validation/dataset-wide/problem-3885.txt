I think that such graphs exist, but haven't been lucky yet. The "natural" candidates like a $C_{2k}$ along with its diagonals of a certain length don't seem to work but some come close to property B. 

EDIT : after David's answer, I've realized now that there is an easy construction showing that $d_n$ is not bounded. For $d$ fixed, take concentric circles of radii $d,2d,3d,\dots$. On each one, place six disks that form a regular hexagon and rotate each hexagon a bit more, in a way that, imagining a light source at the center, all rays are eventually blocked by some disk. This is possible with a finite number of circles because the harmonic series diverges. The resulting pattern is clearly not separable. If on the $i$-th circle, we take a regular $6i$-gon instead of a hexagon, the disks are almost regularly distributed, forming a pattern like in those round plastic brushes or in a shower head. 

For a periodic coloring $C_d(n,k)$, let $D$ be a fundamental domain, i.e. a colored minimal cuboid such that its periodic continuation in all coordinate directions yields the given coloring. Some easy examples, all for $k=2$: 

For better visualizing and understanding fractals like the Mandelbrot set, the idea of color cycling is a great invention. Points outside the fractal are colored according to the number of iterations when a threshold assuring divergence ("bail out") is reached. Imagining the fractal bearing en electrical charge or a temperature, the points of same color, i.e. of same rate of divergence, form "equipotential lines" around it. Of course, those lines become more and more intricate as one comes close to the fractal. So far, this is only static, but now cycling in time through the colors of the (periodic) color palette, either towards the fractal or outward, reveals so much more about its hard-to-see structures. E.g. for the Mandelbrot set, knowing that it is simply connected, cycling helps particularly in regions with spiral-like patterns to get an idea "where it is connected". Just google for the terms fractal color cycling and you'll find tons of more or less hallucinating videos. 

EDIT for the record: The integrals $$J(n,m):= \int _0^1\dfrac{\text{arctanh}^nx}{x^m}dx= \int _0^1\log^{n/2}\left(\dfrac{1+x }{1-x}\right)\dfrac{dx}{x^m}$$ and $$K(n,m):= \int _1^\infty\dfrac{\text{arcoth}^nx}{x^m}dx =\int _1^\infty\log^{n/2}\left(\dfrac{x+1}{x-1}\right)\dfrac{dx}{x^m}$$ have very similar situations with the exact same zeta values involved as for $I(n,m)$: We have $$J(n,m)=\frac{n!}{2^{n-m}m!} \cdot Z^{n}p_ {m}(\frac1{Z} ),\qquad K(n,m)=\frac{n!}{2^{n-m}m!} \cdot\bar Z^{n}p_ {m}(\frac1{\bar Z} )$$ with even/odd polynomials $p_m$, the same for both integrals, of degree $m−2$. Again, powers $Z^r$ are to be replaced by $\zeta(r)$, but powers $\bar Z^r$ are to be replaced this time by $\bar\zeta(r):=\dfrac{2^{r-1}-1}{2^{r-1}}\zeta(r)$. Here the polynomials $p_m\equiv p_m(z)$ are (essentially) not reducible, and instead of a recursion for $J(n,m)$, there is at least one for the polynomials: $$p_1=0,\ p_2=1, \ \frac{p_m}m=z\frac {p_{m-1}}{m-1} +\frac {m-3}4p_{m-2}.$$ The first of them are $p_3=\frac32z$ $p_4=2z^2+1$ $p_5=\frac52( z^3+2z)$ $p_6=\frac32(2z^4+10z^2+3)$ $p_7=\frac74(2z^5+20z^3+23z)$ $p_8=4z^6 +70z^4+196z^2+45$ $p_9=\frac92(z^7+28z^5+154z^3+132z)$ Note that $p_m(1)=\dfrac{m!}{2^{m-1}}$ for $m\ge2$. 

After all the discussion raised by this old question, I am wondering about a somewhat complementary one: 

The density (i.e. the proportion of $\bigl[\frac{k+r-1}2\bigr]^\text{th}$ powers among all values) of a given column is for coprime $k,r$ $$ \begin{cases}\frac3{k+r} & \text{if}\ k\not\equiv r\pmod 2\\ \frac4{k+r} & \text{if} \ k\equiv r\pmod 2\text{ i.e. both odd}\end{cases}$$ and a certain multiple of that if $k,r$ are not coprime. The first entries of $e(n,k,r)$ for $r=2,...,8$ are displayed below, with a "$-$" sign meaning that the corresponding power $d(n,k,r)$ bears a negative sign. (So in fact, compared with the $d(n,k,1)$ table above I have just omitted the exponents $\bigl[\frac{k+r-1}2\bigr]$ for better lisibility.) Sadly I couldn't get the entries of the columns to flush right, and I did not want to do that manually. 

This is inspired by the same beautiful integral expression for $\zeta(3)$ as this question, but goes in a slightly different direction. Writing the original integral in the form $$\int_0^1\frac{x(1-x)}{\sin\pi x}dx=7\frac{\zeta(3)}{\pi^3} ,$$ it turns out that for $n\in\mathbb N$ there is a unique monic polynomial $p_n$ of degree $n-1$ such that $$\int_0^1x^np_n(x)\frac{1-x}{\sin\pi x}dx=c_{2n+1}\frac{\zeta(2n+1)}{\pi^{2n+1} } $$ with rational $c_k=4(k-1)! \dfrac{2^k-1}{2^k}= (4-2^{2-k})(k-1)! $. This follows for $\zeta(2n+1)$ from solving the linear system given by the blue lines numbered $n+1,...,2n$ in the other question. As Zurab Silagadze answered it by giving an explicit formula of the coefficients in the blue lines, the $p_n$'s can be calculated. I don't know however if it is possible to give a formula in closed form (meaning here that it should not contain a matrix inversion), but see below. The first polynomials are $$\begin{align} p_1(x)&=1 \\ p_2(x)&=3-x \\ p_3(x)&=25-20x+x^2 \\ p_4(x)&=455-707x+287x^2-x^3 \\ p_5(x)&=14301-34734x+29046x^2-8304x^3+x^4 \\ p_6(x)&=683067-2289309x+2949276x^2-1721434x^3+382547x^4-x^5 \\ \end{align}$$ The constant terms are supposedly the sequence A272482, thus, correcting the oeis typo $1/(2n)!$, $$[x^0]p_n(x)= {(2n)!}[x^{2n}y^n]\frac{\cos\frac{x(1-y)}{2}} {\cos\frac{x(1+y)}{2}} = \frac 1{4^n} {2n\choose n}\sum_{i=0}^n{n\choose i}E_i,$$ where $E_i$ are the Euler numbers. This seems to suggest something similar for the other coefficients, and thus possibly a closed form. 

Please would somebody better qualified than me to do so write accounts here of Reallisability and Proof Mining. 

Taking $C$ to be the pushout, you're asking that the surjection from the coproduct to the pushout be split. There is no natural reason (in either the formal or informal sense) why this should happen. You don't say much about what sort of category $\mathbb C$ is supposed to be, so we might as well switch the arrows and ask about pullbacks being retracts of products instead. The pullback of $p$ and $q$ is $\lbrace(x,y)\vert p(x)=q(y)\rbrace$, so the splitting would take an arbitrary pair $(x,y)$ to one that satisfies the equation. Why should there be such a map? Going back to the pushout, for simplicity in $\mathbf{Set}$ and in the case where your maps $a$ and $b$ are mono, the pushout is the disjoint union $A+B$ with some of the members of $A$ "identified with" those of $B$. The corresponding members of the pushout therefore "don't know" whether they came from $A$ or from $B$. However, your splitting arbitrarily assigns each of them to one or the other. So the map from $A+B$ to the pushout and back to $A+B$ leaves some points in place and swaps others between $A$ and $B$. What you have here is therefore the idea behind Radu Diaconescu's proof that Choice entails Excluded Middle in a topos. An interesting exercise would be to translate this behaviour of disjoint unions and pushouts in sets to "amalgamated products", which I think are what coproducts and pushouts used to be called in algebra. 

No. There is no need to say any more than that, since the answer is in the question, except that MathOverflow will not let me submit something with so few characters. 

No, you have stated nowhere near enough conditions to achieve this. For example, let $X$ and $Y$ both be your favourite metric space ($R$, (for example) but give $X$ the discrete metric (with $d(x,y)=1$ if $x\neq y$) and let $f$ be the identity (on points). Then all of the subsets of $X$ are open and so also $G_\delta$. However, they need not have this property in $Y$. Edit: I have removed, reconsidered and consolidated various other comments that I made about this problem. My initial reaction was that ljjpfx had omitted to say that $f$ should be a homeomorphism (have a continuous inverse) and not just be continuous and bijective. There are well known conditions under which a continuous bijection $f:X\to Y$ is a homeomorphism, for example if $X$ is compact and $Y$ is Hausdorff. I thought that all of this would render the original question rather trivial and likely to be closed, whereas I wanted to have the opportunity to develop it into something more interesting. What I hadn't appreciated is that most subspaces that are defined in any reasonable fashion are $G_\delta$. It seems that Nate didn't notice this either and nor am I convinced by Emil's counterexample. What is an example of a non-$G_\delta$ subspace of $\Bbb R$? The direction in which I had wanted to develop this question was by introducing overt subspaces. I asked ljjpfx what situation had given rise to the question because I was wondering whether s/he was actually working with overt subspaces rather than $G_\delta$ ones. Formally, overtness is the lattice dual of compactness, in particular the direct image of an overt subspace is overt just as happens in the compact case. The reason why you haven't heard of this notion before is that every (sub)space is overt in classical topology. (The points mess things up, rather than excluded middle.) The idea comes from various approaches to unifying topology with computation. Overt in English means explicit. In constructive topology it means having evidence. The Bishop school of constructive analysis has used notions of locatedness and total boundedness to fill in constructive gaps in classical theorems. Locale Theory and Formal Topology both develop the subject in terms of open subspaces instead of points, the former in a categorical setting (in a topos) and the latter in Martin-L&oumlaut;f type theory. Peter Johnstone and André Joyal called a locale open if its terminal projection is an open map. Giovanni Sambin introduced positivity for formal topology. My own approach to construcive/computable topology is called Abstract Stone Duality. It started from categorical ideas but developed into a language that only expresses computable continuous functions. My paper A Lambda Calculus for Real Analysis is the best place to start with this; it emphasises the dual behaviour of overt and compact subspaces and applies them to the (constructive) intermediate value theorem. Recently I have been working on a characterisation of overt subspaces in locally compact metric spaces and open maps between them. I will add a link from this page when I am ready to circulate a draft of this. In particular, overt subspaces are $G_\delta$, which is why I got involved in this question. However, I now realise that all of the subspaces that I construct in ASD are $G_\delta$ too.
