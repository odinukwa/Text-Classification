Let's look at the possible attack points of a person in armor. I train HEMA (medieval combat) and fight in plate armor every now and then so that's my perspective. Gaps are non-existant with your barrier so let's skip those, but weak points are still important. A key factor to combat would be forcing your opponent to strengthen a part of the barrier and then attack a different one. Feigning, in other words. This is important in any kind of fighting, but it would be emphasised in your scenario. Combat would be primarily oriented around tricking your opponent while not being tricked yourself and then attacking the weaker parts of the barrier. For this, a poleaxe would probably be a good weapon. You could feign a piercing attack to the chest with the shaft end and then quickly shift into an attack to the head with the other end. A properly wielded poleaxe is fast and powerful and one of the best allround weapons of the medieval period. A strike to the head would also be a good option. A knock-out is not dependent on what damage you can do, but rather how quickly and forceful you can twist the head of your opponent. A solid straight blow in the face would hurt me, but is unlikely to knock me out. A solid hook connecting with my cheek however would twist my head enough to shake up my brain and make me go down. This all depends, naturally, on the rigidity of the barrier, but for people to be able to move around the barrier would still need to be flexible. Another good strategy would then be grappling. By twisting the limbs you would inflict pain, the enemy would have to strengthen the barrier there to avoid injury or further pain and that's when you use a round dagger to stab them. In general, techniques would be quick and deceptive. They would be much about manouvering the opponent into a position where they're forced to open up weak points in the barrier. Dual wielding would probably be much more common. But blunt weapons would also be very common. A good strike might not drain the barrier, but could still inflict a lot of internal damage. Hit he belly to send a shockwave through the body that might disrupt the internal organs. Hit the head to inflict concussions. Internal bleeding might not kill as quickly, but kill it will. On that note, nets would probably be more common too. It would still entangle the foe making it possible to go in and pummel them. I suspect that most combat techniques would be about finding and exploiting the nature of the barrier. The devil is in the details they say and that would also be true here. How quickle can someone shift the strength of the barrier? How much force is needed to pierce it and where would be the best place to do so? If I throw dust in the face of someone, will it stick to the barrier, fall off directly or go right through it? Does it work like a super strong chainmail so that smaller things can get through? Would it hold off water or other substances? What about fire? Guns would probably develop from handheld cannons to something more useable faster than it did IRL. There are a lot of nuances here and you would do well to explore the exact nature of your barriers in order to answer this question properly. 

I want to add a few things. Your timeline covers a lot of history. I myself have only read in depth about WW2 and the Soviet side of the space race. 

I would just add that, if we do this back in the early 1900's...it would probably kill them regardless of any medical conditions. Imagine showing The Blair Witch Project, or some other modern horror movie, to people from that era. I suspect even a lot of the younger folks would die, either of heart attack or psycho-stresses soon after. (Ironically, like you started in your OP, a lot of horror films have this theme where a person sees a video and they die from it, and a valid way to do that might be to show a horror movie too!) The propaganda approach is also equally valid here. People like Stalin took advantage of new technology like radio and movies, of which most people had never heard/seen before, to build huge cults of personality. So you could use a propaganda movie to make the people go to war or march to the south pole, whatever. So in your book, ask yourself what "culture" the general population has. Then ask yourself, what about other cultures? Future cultures? Will 100 years from now have movies that could make us die today? Alien cultures? They might be different enough in just the right way, that us today might suffer and die from watching one of their movies. 

I think you have a good timeline that, if you're really serious about maximum plausibility, just needs a little work. If you ever do publish or post it online, please come back and post a link so we can get it. As others have recommended, I will recommend too: don't get too bogged down in backstory. Stick with the action parts and enthralling parts first. First impressions are everything, and to quote the X-Files, however paranoid you are, you aren't paranoid enough. You can tell the backstory gradually over time with flashbacks, conversation, history lessons? If you haven't heard of Isaac Asimov, I highly recommend his short stories. He was a master of telling backstory through simple conversation between two characters. You can probably get anthologies of him on amazon for one penny (and 3.99 shipping! >:O ) 

Obviously, it depends on the masses of the two stars, and the distance between them. Let's assume both of them are Sun-sized or smaller, and the gas giant is Jupiter-sized. If the stars are very close together, perhaps 0.1 AU, then you could have a stable planetary orbit at 1 AU without any trouble. Another stable option is if the stars are 1 AU apart, and the planet is at the shared L4/5 point, forming an equilateral triangle. Technically this is a P-type orbit, since the system center of gravity is closer to the stars than the planet. Other arrangements would probably require the planet to be farther away, otherwise it would risk being perturbed by the closer star when the three bodies are aligned. 

The traveling object is (briefly) removed from communication with the universe, then brought back in at the other end. The endpoints are reasonably stationary and cannot be artificially moved. You cannot return to your starting point "quickly" (aka before you left). 

If your ships are FTL-capable but cannot land, space cities should be in planetary orbit. There you use short-range methods to transit the gravity well. The outer end of a space elevator would be excellent. If your ships are sprightly (e.g. zero-point anti-grav) but do not have self-contained FTL, stations should control jump points. Make up some law of nature that requires them to be off-planet and limited in number (e.g. natural alderson points and/or expensive star gates). The city grows there. If your ships can lift off, escape planetary gravity, go to warp independently, and come back down to another planet, then spaceports would be ground-based. A space city would require some other reason to exist. Next to an uninhabitable planetoid rich in rare elements? A deep space safe haven amidst light-years of otherwise-impassable dangers? 

A round trip between two objects that are moving (relative to each other) at a significant fraction of light speed. A wormhole that allows physical contact between two separated locations simultaneously. 

Converting my comments into an answer: where the city is should flow from why the city is. Real-world cities exist where transportation and geography intersect. Seaports are places to transfer between ships and road vehicles. Airports transfer between planes and road. Also, waypoints form at oases of habitability along important but difficult travel routes, such villages on the silk road. In a space civilization, there are two good breakpoints: ground vs local space, and local space vs interplanetary/interstellar.
