That would depend on your boss and your actual performance. You look like a clueless idiot if you rate yourself as all 5s and your boss thinks you are all 2 and 3's. On the other hand, I suspect that the people who rate all 5s tend to overall get higher ratings if they genuinely are in the 4-5 range anyway. I can't prove that, but.... Personally, my take is I rate myself where I really think I fall. The spots where what you think and what your boss thinks are different are critical to improving your performance. What I think is ultimately more important than the numeric rating is the discussions. This is your chance to remind your boss of the things you have accomplished. The more numbers you can put in here the better (Managers love numbers). One of the things I do is keep track of all the "Attaboy" emails I get telling me what a wonderful job I did on the xyz project. I had 20 of them last year and you can bet that went into my performance appraisal. I note any awards I received through the year (we have a very active employee awards program here). I note the projects that I completed on time and on budget. I note especially anything related to client satisfaction (we moved one of the main clients I deal with from the lowest satisfaction rating to the highest one). I note how my performance aligns with the published company values. I note anything I did that was above and beyond my job description. 

Generally when you get referred to another department it means one of two things: Most commonly it means that something about you impressed the orginal interviewers but they felt your skill set wasn't quite right for the job you applied for but would fit well somewhere else or they felt someone else was a better fit but they still wanted to find an organizational spot for you. These are often new postions/vacancies they haven't yet advertised, so this tends to be a boon to the applicant. Financial analyst to IT is a pretty big stretch though. Perhaps they saw reporting/data analysis as your strong point instead of dealing with clients and wanted to create a data analyst/big data position for you. The other scenario that sometimes happens is that a critical vacany occurs and they think you could fill it and they have plenty of applicants for the job you applied for but need the other person urgently. Hiring you would save the time it takes to advertise and review reumes and interview many people. All I can say is that generally when we refer the person to another position, they have a good chance of getting that position. Usually there is less competition and we have already decided they have the skill set needed and maybe the personality fit as well. To help prepare for the interview, you should ask to see a job description of the job they have referred you to. You may find it is less hard core programming and more data analysis than you think. 

I sympathize with your desire not to participate, as a childless, single woman, I can't tell you how many baby and wedding showers I have been asked to contribute to and I don't even ever get a present in return. But the truth is, there is no graceful way to decline these things and not look like a jerk. If you have accepted a birthday present already, then you truly are obligated to contribute to others. If you haven't, then you still need to make the contribution or you are likely to be very negatively viewed by your colleagues no matter how politiely you decline and no matter if you refuse a present of your own (which it would be VERY RUDE to do after they bought one). If people who make less than you contribute, then you will especially be perceived as entitled and uppity. So really, you should just budget a small amount for this and then pay up graciously and graciously accept the present in turn and tell people how nice it was. You could try to change the company culture, but, unless a lot of the others hate the custom too, you still come off as a jerk who thinks he is too good for the rest of us. 

Agree as mildly as you can and change the subject. Disagree and state why Change the subject whenever it comes up. Talk to your boss privately and explain that you would prefer not be involved in political discussions at work. You might also point out that you being in the group on the opposite side of this issue is making you feel uncomfortable and singled out making it hard to be accepted. 

Since you did this before making a request to let it slide, I would suggest that the best alternative is to fill out the forms and pay up for every personal call. Then take that paperwork to your boss, tell him how long it took and ask if you can be given a waiver for doing this under a set amount agreed to by you and the boss. Then you will know if you must do this every month or not. If they want you to do it no matter how small the amount, failure to do so is generally a firing offense. I've worked places where any long distance personal call at all was cause for firing (of course long distance was more expensive way back when). And having spent my time analyzing phone bills for a large organization (yes that was a horribly boring job even if the data was ina datbase!), I can tell you that those personal little calls can add up over several thousand employees to a nice little cost savings so they may not be willing to let it slide. So pay up this month and then try to negotiate a better deal. As far as whether calling home to talk to the spouse about staying late, that is most definitely a personal call. It isn't necessary to do your work, it is only necessary to keep your home life happy. (note I'm not saying I wouldn't make this call if my spouse was still alive, but only that it doesn't matter from a work perspective if you do.) 

Its most appropriate if one person is stuck. Sometimes talking it out will break the roadblock. It is also appropriate if the two people work well together and can both afford the time spent. My boss and I once locked ourselves in an office and produced a well received policy manual (that none of the higher ups who reviewed it changed a single word on) of several hundred pages in less than a week. The people who didn't collaborate had spent six months writing the version we completely threw out and rewrote. Some creative workers work better alone and some work better when they have someone to bounce ideas off of, a company should try to allow them the freedom to do whatever is going to work best for them. However, depending on how billing of the customers is done, it may not always be possible to add a second person to the project. A project tight in hours may not have the flexibility of a larger project. 

You basically have a choice to make, the employees have made it clear that they are unwilling to work with Leon. Basically he has humilated them at every turn (even if he didn't intend to) and it is no wonder they are feeling uncomfortable. Your own behavior hasn't helped. You appear to see this guy as a wonder boy and that everyone else on your team is worthless next to him. So if he is so good and they are so bad, then fire the rest of them. What, oh can't do that because they really aren't worthless or there is too much work for one wonder kid to do? Then start making them feel worthwhile. Stop being a fan boy and recognize that everyone can contribute and those contributions are also valued. Stop just accepting everything this guy says as gospel and listen to the others as well. Use some of their suggestions even if they are not as good as Leon's (You want to work to make them better not make them give up because they can't compete.) Reward small steps in the right direction. Really one month is not enough time to prove this guy is the best thing in the world and even smart talented people are not right all the time. But shutting everyone else out of the idea generating and decison making process has hurt the rest of the people and ultimately the company. BTW, Leon didn't do this, you did. Sometimes you also have to realize that gradual change is more effective in the long run. People need time to adjust to new methods. All people are resistant to change. You have to factor that into your planning. You went ahead too fast and frightened the rest of your staff. You thought short term and now you have a long term problem to deal with in that you frightened your entire staff and it is entirely possible that you will have no staff except Leon shortly. Maybe they don't even understand how to work the way he does. Wouldn't you feel threatened if someone came in and solved some hard problems with a solution you didn't even understand and then every time you suggested anything, the wonder kid shot down the idea and then your boss did what ever came out of wonder kid's mouth as if you were completely irrelevant? And now you are expected to be at his level with no training and no support and not even a good understanding of what you need to do? There is very little as threatening as having someone come in and feel as if your job is at risk, people need their jobs to continue to have a roof over their heads and food on the table. You hit them in their most vunerable place and now you wonder why they won't work with the guy? So now you have a situation where this perfectly nice person is hated and everyone wants him gone. First, start being a manager. Don't just put off tough calls with "I'll think about it" that makes neither Leon or the rest of the team happy. Why didn't you say to them that Leon has turned your financial situation around and that you have no intention of firing him and that they have to learn to work with him? Why didn't you assure them their jobs were secure (that's what this really is about)? Why didn't you offer them training to get to Leon's level especially concerning the coding stardard you now want to have? Why didn't you divide the duties so that the less talented have something to call their own, while the idea guy is out there generating ideas or creating architecture for the rest to work within? Why didn't you recognize that naturally the rest of your staff would feel threatened and do something to make them feel better before it reached this point? Think about it, wonder kids are few and far between, it's hard to hire a whole company of them. You need to make sure other people are considered valueable contributors as well. What you and Leon need to do now is mentor the rest of the staff up to a higher level. You need to start listening to their ideas and to gently lead them to new ideas through asking questions rather than letting Leon shoot them down and automatically do what ever he said. You can assign research on various ways to do things and then have Leon work one on one with some of them. You need to get them involved again. At this point you may not be able to salvage the situation. By the time employees get so afraid that they ask you fire someone who is doing well, they may already be committed to leaving. If you are not willing to fire Leon, likely at least some of them will be moving on. So start planning for that. You also might need to get them in a room together and tell them directly that you screwed up (you did.) and that you did not intend for them to feel that Leon was replacing them. Ask them what they need to to feel comfortable again without firing Leon (make it clear that is not going to happen as you should have when they orginally said something.) Ask them what they need to feel comfortable with the new coding appraoch. Then give them what they need short of firing Leon. Grovel if you must. Tell them that you do respect them and their abilities. Then show them that is true by your actions. You frightened them and now you need to reassure them that they are safe (and mean it, people can often sense when managers lie about this) or you need to get rid of them immediately which is kinder than waiting. You need to let them know where they stand and why and what changes they will have to accomodate. You probably should put your entire schedule on hold until you retrain these people. Make them write code using the new methods as a training exercise and have Leon code review it and help them see how to do it themselves. They may need some more detailed training in basic concepts before getting to the new standard such as you would have given to Cobol programmers at the dawn of Object-oriented programming. You have given them a new paradigm in how to do things, it is up to you to take the time (and yes during work hours, plan on NOTHING getting acomplished until you do this) to make sure they understand how to work with it. Make them see the benefits as well. Make a contest to reward them for getting this knowledge and give a bonuses to the people in the group (not Leon who you should have rewarded separately already if he really is that good, you don't want to lose the whole staff and them have Leon head out for greener pastures either) who uses this new technique to solve an actual current business problems. Make them see there is something in it for them by adjusting to this change.
