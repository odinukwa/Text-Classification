I carry two knives when i'm backpacking: a small Swiss army knife (the "Classic" model) and a large hunting knife (I can't remember the brand, it is a good quality one, cost about $150). The Swiss army knife is lightweight and indispensable for its use as a can opener, for gutting fish, and general purpose tools. The authentic Swiss army knives are also extremely good quality and durable. The hunting knife I carry on my belt primarily as a weapon in case I need it for some reason (attacked by an animal, which has never happened in my 35 years of hiking), and also will sometimes use it to chop up smaller pieces of firewood. 

I've spent many years hiking and camping in the Rocky Mountains and California, and animals I have seen more than once or regularly include black bears, deer, elk, moose, wild turkey, beaver, mountain goats and longhorn sheep. I've never seen mountain lions, although they are plentiful, but they keep themselves hidden. My aunt's husband says he wanted to photograph one once, so he hiked up into the mountains of Colorado and camped out at a place where he knew he had the best chance. He camped out there for a few days. On the third day, he was sitting outside reading a book when he saw a movement. He looked up, saw a cougar looking at him, he reached over for his camera and had just enough time to take a photo of its hind legs as it ran away. 

So you can use any of the above as a "blanket" one-size-fits-all method for killing pathogens. The methods used for killing pathogens do not remove chemical contamination. The removal of chemical contamination is a different matter. First you must identify the contaminant. Depending on what it is, there may or may not be a method for leaching it out, it varies from one contaminant to another. 

Before, you leave treat your equipment with water-repellant spray, and consider taking a small bottle with you. Some things that come to mind: 

I just got back from fishing in Minnesota, where one of the kinds of fish we were catching were pike in the 25" range. I had metal leaders in my tackle box but I didn't use them. I used a standard spinning reel, 6' medium action rod, and 8'lb monofilament with a swivel and another 2' of monofilament line with a single barbed hook. And nightcrawlers for bait. Pike are aggressive, so they are more likely to strike when the bait is moving. Particularly if it starts moving suddenly after resting for a while. So all of our pike strikes were when we were trolling or reeling in. One of my catches was when I started up the motor in our boat and started driving while my line and bait was still in the water. The pike struck that and I didn't even realize I had hooked it until I stopped the boat a few yards away and grabbed my pole. Pike also like to hang out in reeds and vegetation, because they can lurk, hide, and ambush the prey that are swimming by. Unfortunately this makes it more difficult for us fisherman because we're always getting tangled up in the weeds. So I've heard of people using a type of spoon (lure) that is designed to not get caught in weeds as you reel it in. Another tip for pike (as for all fish) is that in the early morning they are more likely to be closer to the surface. Being an aggressive fish, i've heard of people catching them with buzz-bait, which is a noisy, loud top-surface lure. I personally have only ever caught bass on buzz-bait, but I suppose it's possible to catch pike with them too. 

Assuming you are in a location where the signal can be picked up by a satellite – which they almost always can be – the AFRCC will receive your call almost immediately. Most PLBs these days are GPS-integrated. 

Does a tent need any special care after camping on or near ocean beaches? I know that salt can corrode metal (e.g. metal in the poles, stakes, zippers, etc.) and sand can mechanically abrade many parts of a tent. I don't know to what extent occasional use in those conditions will affect the longevity of a tent though. Do I need to rinse everything out when I get done with such a trip, or is simply drying and brushing out the tent as usual sufficient to protect it from wearing out? Is there some other maintenance I should be considering following use in these conditions? 

Benadryll is available over the counter and you should have it in your first aid kit. Epi is by prescription only (at least in the US), so the individual who has allergies should carry their own. If you're leading a large group, you may be able to get a prescription and standing orders for trained staff to carry and administer epinephrine to group members. Many people think that just injecting epi when somebody has an anaphylactic attack is the entire treatment. It's important to know that epinephrine does not fix the underlying issue! It only helps to reduce swelling, helping to re-open the airway. You must fix the cause of the reaction! As soon as an exposure to a known allergen occures – even if the person isn't having a visible reaction – you need to immediately have the person take an antihistamine. Antihistamines are drugs that suppress the histamine response, i.e. the body's overreaction to an antigen. This is what actually reduces the severity of the allergic reaction itself. Correct dosage depends on the person; consult the instructions on the antihistamines or talk to a doctor. The important consideration with an allergic reaction is maintaining a clear airway. If you get the antihistamines into the patient immediately, it's possible that the reaction will be contained and the patient will not develop anaphylaxis. In the event that they do develop anaphylaxis, that's where you need to monitor their airway and administer epi if necessary. If the patient is having difficulty breathing, encourage them to take deep, calm breaths, and to pace their breathing off yours. If the patient is unable to maintain a clear airway, be prepared to administer epinephrine. Epi-pen trainer kits are widely available through first aid training programs, so if you expect to be traveling in the wilderness with people who may require epi, you should do the training. The auto-injectors have clear instructions on them; typically you just remove the blue cap, place the orange end of the auto-injector on their thigh, push down hard on the epi-pen to trigger the injector, and hold it in place for at least 30 seconds. The epi is administered automatically at the correct dosage. Make sure to carefully follow the directions as individual auto-injectors may vary in how exactly they are administered. Epi wears off after 10-15 minutes, so most people will carry either a dual-injector or two injectors, so that a second dose can be administered if necessary. When injecting, always hold the injector gripped in your fist, do not place anything over either end of the pen to ensure you don't accidentally inject it into yourself! 

Instead of running or walking, I recommend you go to the gym and do the Stairmaster. This will provide an aerobic workout while building the muscles you need for hiking and scrambling. This is what I do to get in shape for backpacking trips. Edit 3/5/2015: Providing an answer to anatols questions in the comments: I use the Stairmaster 4-5 times a week, 30 minutes each. The speed will depend on your aerobic profile: the idea is to spend the first five or ten minutes building up to your target heart rate, and spend the remainder of the workout keeping it within the target range. You can search online for "aerobic target heartrate" for details. I carry a small electronic pulse-meter to measure my heartrate. Although after you've done this a few times you'll get to know your body and you can pretty accurately guess your heartrate without it. You can use the Stairmaster with or without backpack. I recommend both. With the backpack will greater strengthen the specific muscles and better simulate the backpacking experience. Without backpack is just as good for your heart too. 

I'd recommend an outer shell plus a fleece jacket - two items. The advantage here is that if the fleece is too warm (or too cold), you can replace it with another fleece that's more appropriate. Which means you can use a lighter, thinner fleece for spring and Fall, and a thicker fleece for winter. Just about any brand of shell and fleece will work. If you're gung-ho on quality, then I'd recommend the Marmot or Cloudveil brands. I own a Cloudveil shell which I've had for years, I've used it backpacking and hiking all over the Western U.S.. Very good quality. Marmot is also very impressive. I don't think there's anything softer than a Marmot fleece. 

A .357 for any type of bear that is not a grizzly. For a grizzly there is no handgun that will help you - all you will end up doing is upsetting it and making it more aggressive. 11/4: Additional info.

I was out camping recently, and found that the bottom foot or so of my sleeping bag had gotten wet ( in part due to one of the stakes for my rain fly coming loose, but that's another story). As no one likes sleeping with feet in a wet sleeping bag, I was forced to curl myself up, which is an uncomfortable way to sleep as well. That got me thinking; is it possible to waterproof a sleeping bag? I have some waterproofing spray that I used on my boots and part of a tent, and it says that it is usable on nylon, suede, leather, and Gore-Tex. I was wondering how effective it would be, and whether it would damage my sleeping bag in some way. I was considering only spraying the waterproofing on the bottom foot or so of the bag, since I had seen things mentioning that waterproofing can remove the breathability of the bag. 

Acid rain usually has a pH of around 4-5, while normal rain is around 5.6, and pure water is 7, or neutral [1] [2]. To give that in perspective, acid rain is less acidic than orange juice or soda, while normal rain is closer to bananas [3]. You shouldn't be in danger from the acid rain itself any more so than normal rain. However, you are more in danger from the pollutants which cause acid rain, such as sulfur dioxide and the various nitrogen oxides [4]. Acid rain has more of an effect on wildlife, where it can interfere with the hatching of fish eggs (most of which cant hatch below a pH of 5), as well as leaching aluminum from the soil into lakes and streams. Additionally, it can remove nutrients from the soil, as well as damage stone and metal sculptures [4]. In conclusion, you should not be directly effected by acid rain, though the pollutants which cause it can harm you, and it will harm the environment in a bunch of different ways. 

There isn't much to be said about the preparation that hasn't been said by DudeOnRock, but making sure that you are dry, have a comfortable sleeping pad, and are warm are definitely key. One thing to note is that you are going to be biking a lot, which will tire you out. I can tell you that some of my best sleep has been while camping, even when it was less comfortable sleeping arrangements. Definitely sleep in a tent if you are worried about waking up and it's your first time outdoors, and make sure that you set it up properly. If not, water could get in when it rains (staking the tent out is key). If you want, feel free to bring earbuds if you like to listen to music when you fall asleep, or earplugs if that's what you prefer. When setting up a tent, I would recommend putting a groundcloth/tarp on the ground, then your tent with a rainfly, then a space blanket, then your sleeping pad and finally your sleeping bag. The series of layers helps keep you dry if it rains, even if some part of your sleep system fails, or if there is a large amount of water. You would be more likely to wake up because you get wet than due to the sound of rain, which is why I think that setting up a tent well is very important. One last thing is if you do intend to sleep outdoors, practice setting up and taking down your tent and sleeping arrangements at home first, that way you aren't trying to do it for the first time when it really matters. Tents are not necessarily intuitive, and experience with your equipment can help a lot. 

Candela is the unit for a point measurement which doesn't depend on the distance. Candelas are inversely proportional to the square of lux. You can convert lux to candela using the inverse square law: where d is the distance in meters from the light source. 

In areas with quotas on permits, often only a certain percentage of permits can be reserved. The remainder are available on a first-come first-serve basis at the ranger station. For Mt Whitney, there is definitely a quota. There's likely to be a lot of competition to get a permit for such a popular trail at such a popular time of year. I would recommend getting to the ranger station at least an hour before it opens. There could already be people in line even then. There may also be limits on how far in advance you must reserve a permit. It's possible that the reason you only see permits for the next couple days is because people cancelled reservations, and now those permits are available on a first-come basis in-person. 

Of course. You can (almost) always cool down a 4-season tent, but you can't very well protect a 2-season tent from a blizzard. The primary concern is weight, but if you're going to be camping near a glacier with -5°C winds, you'll want a sturdy tent, so that's going to come at a certain cost of weight. To keep a tent cooler, you can pitch it in the shade, you can open the vents and windows, etc. There's nothing wrong with using a 4 season tent in the summer; I've done this on many a trip. The point of the quote you referenced is that a 4 season tent may not be ideal in non-winter conditions, as there may be a more convenient tent, but the a 4 season tent is certainly more than adequate for camping in summer conditions. 

If you're not concerned about bears, I would (ironically) suggest using an Ursack. The Ursack is a kevlar bag that is "bear resistant" but not legally approved for use in many areas which require bear canisters. They weight much less than bear cans, but are very resistant to punctures, so a coyote shouldn't be able to break into one. You may have concerns with a rodent squeezing through the opening, so you'd have to be certain that you completely and snugly close it every time.
