It's not arbitrary, and while the ease of rule-writing is certainly a consideration, this is not what determines which sound is the phoneme and which sound is the allophone. To re-use @Alek Storm's first example: 

Yes, there is some evidence that some of the archetypal isolating/analytic languages of South-East Asia may be developing more morpholexical complexity. However, it seems that there are only early signs, in comparison to the evidence for English becoming more analytic - that's been happening for hundreds of years so it's pretty easy to spot by now. It's important to consider that although many typical isolating languages seem to lack inflectional morphology, they may still show quite a lot of derivational morphology. In this paper by Enfield (2005), there is some brief discussion of derivational morphology in Mon-Khmer languages, noting that while for some languages, like Khmer, the derivational morphology is visible but no longer productive, in other languages, such as Semelai, the system is quite rich and productive. Enfield also discusses the resources used by some languages of mainland South-East Asia to create elaborative, alliterative or rhyming expressions, noting that these frequently give rise to morphologically complex structures, and in particular that "a huge system of such patterns is found in Vietnamese (Thompson 1987 [1965]), despite its status as an archetypically morphology-poor language". He also adds that "the productivity and internal complexity of elaborative morpholexicon in MSEA languages should weaken claims that these languages lack morphology. One just has to know where to look." One example given from Lao is qêêk5-lêêk5 'lying askew like someone asleep in an awkward position'. I don't know if there's any evidence for the derivational morphology in these languages becoming more complex over time, but for some it certainly doesn't seem to be going away. As far as more inflectional-type morphology goes, there was some work comparing grammaticalization in Mandarin Chinese and Thai, two typologically very similar languages, both at the extreme end of the 'isolating' part of the morphosyntactic structure continuum. In this paper by Post (2007), various types of constructions are examined to assess the depth of the grammaticalization of certain features, given that compounds and polysyllabic constructions are common in both languages and "some affixlike behaviour has been observed". Post finds that, for Chinese and Thai constructions of comparable form and function: 

No, there is no terminology for the level of closeness a 'phonetic expression' takes to its 'meaning', quite simply because this is not something that is researched or discussed in linguistic circles, as there is no real reason to engage in this sort of enquiry. Here are some reasons why: 1) As addressed in the comments, and as widely believed throughout linguistics, most words are arbitrary with regards to their meaning, with no real connection between the types and combinations of sounds in the word to the referent. 2) When onomatopoeia does occur (and it is rare, in that most languages have a tiny number of onomatopoeic words compared to arbitrary words), it is essentially formalised mimicry. As has been pointed out, you can't get very far comparing human vocalisations to non-human sounds, whether they are sounds of animal calls, falling rocks, rushing water, or whatever. All of these real-world sounds will be produced by very different means, and humans can, at best, come up with an approximation of them that works with the constraints of the human vocal tract. More importantly, an onomatopoeic word can't just try to imitate a referent sound as precisely as possible - it also has to abide by the phoneme inventory, phonotactics and phonological processes specific to the language, at least to a certain extent. This is the main reason why onomatopoeic sounds vary cross-linguistically, plus the fact that different speakers may have different perceptions of the same referent sound, and may therefore be mimicking different aspects of it. Furthermore, an onomatopoeic word is, by virtue of being formalised, a word like any other, and subject to the same processes of language change, in particular sound change. This will also account for a lot of variation in onomatopoeic words for the same referent, and something which may have originally been a close approximation of a referent sound is likely to become further and further removed from it. 3) There is an active area of research into sound symbolism, but the findings are in general tenuous, and are certainly not based on direct correspondences between a word and a particular sound or thing it references. Rather, research on sound symbolism investigates the more subtle connections between certain types of sounds and certain types of very broad, non-concrete meanings. E.g. sonorants as opposed to obstruents, or voiced sounds as opposed to voiceless sounds, or back vowels as opposed to high front vowels, and the connotations they seem to have of qualities such as 'spikiness' or 'roundness', or 'sweetness' or 'sourness', or 'tiny-ness' or 'big-ness', and so on. There is an accessible overview of such research in this New Scientist article. Phonestheme research falls under this category, too. Sound symbolism research has found some very interesting patterns based on human interpretations of nonsense words (and this has produced a wealth of knowledge for advertisers coming up with new brand names and slogans), but this is not so straightforward as an easily observable connection between the sound of the word and the referent, and of course there is still no terminology to describe the degree of similarity between the two, because the referent doesn't generally have a sound in many examples of sound symbolism. (What is the sound of 'sour'?) 

@Joe has covered words for "pineapple", so here's some info on words for "banana". There is a fairly straightforward explanation for why Spanish has the word plátano instead of a variant of banana, compared to the other languages in the above list. Plátano already existed in Spanish to refer to another sort of plant, namely the 'plane tree', or trees of the genus Platanus, whose name can be traced back via Latin through Greek to a Proto-Indo-European root *plat- "to spread". The name is thought to refer to either the largish leaves some of these trees have, or their broad, flat expanses of bark. Various cognates also carry the meaning of 'broad', 'spreading', and so on - in English, plants of the genus Plantago, commonly called plantains, are similarly named for their broad, round leaves, via a borrowing from French. (Edit: to clarify, the plantains just mentioned are a small, herbaceous, bog-loving plant, completely unrelated to any sort of banana). So, once the Spanish-speaking world had access to bananas, plátano was usefully extended to refer to (some) banana plants; given that banana trees have quite enormous leaves, the name is quite appropriate. There is an alternative hypothesis that Spanish got plátano from the Carib word platana (from Arawakan pratane) and that this was altered to make it more similar to Spanish plátano 'plane tree', but there is not much evidence to support this, and either way plátano 'plane tree' is somewhat responsible. But, the list above is a bit disingenuous, because Spanish does have the word banana, and this is the word that Spanish initially borrowed from Wolof, a Niger-Congo language, to refer to the fruit. Depending on what sort of Spanish you speak, banana can refer to to smaller, sweeter fruits we are most familiar with, while plátano might refer to the larger, starchier, less sweet fruits that are generally used in cooking rather than eaten raw. In English, the latter are referred to as plantains or plantain bananas (probably on analogy with Spanish Edit: because although English already had the word 'plantain', it wasn't used to refer to bananas). Both sorts are of the genus Musa. But at least in Mexico, plátano refers to the sweet variety, and plantains are plátano macho. Most modern languages that use a variant of the word banana got the word via either Spanish or Portuguese, and those languages initially borrowed it from Wolof. So, to reiterate Joe's point, "whichever name is used by the introducers gets adopted in many other languages". But in fact, the history of 'words for banana' started long before the Spanish and Portuguese borrowed the modern word from Wolof, and if you look at languages across the world, the word banana hardly comes into play. A recent study by a team of geneticists, archeologists, agricultural scientists and linguists investigated the history of different banana varieties based on the evidence for human cultivation and dispersal of bananas. The evidence suggests that bananas likely originated in New Guinea, and the linguistic information associated with this is pretty interesting. Mark Donohue put together a list of over 1,100 words for 'banana' in languages from Melanesia and South East Asia, the regions in which the banana was first dispersed. The paper can be accessed here (sorry, abstract only unless you have access), but the supplementary materials are available publicly, so if you want to see over 1,100 words for 'banana', go to this page and click the link for Table_S04. Using comparative methods, the researchers reconstructed root forms for different words for 'banana', and found four major cognate sets with distinct, but overlapping, geographical distributions. The root forms were *muku, *punti, *qaRutay, and *baRat. You can see some maps of the distribution of these variants here (pdf). There were other minor groupings and a lot of 'miscellaneous' lexical items that had no clear group of cognates. Banana is labelled as such, and only shows up twice in this whole list (granted, the list doesn't include many African or continental European languages). In sum, while plátano is an oddity in the short list presented above, Spanish actually did use the word banana first, and some varieties of Spanish still do use it for sweet bananas, where plátano specifically refers to plantain bananas. Furthermore, crosslinguistically, banana is actually an oddity in itself. 

It's quite a big claim to say that "literate people - most of them speaking the standard variety - tend to conform their speech to the written form", and there are two main reasons why this can not be taken as a given. Firstly, there is an enormous amount of research showing that speakers generally command a range of ways of speaking their native language, some of which are closer to the standard, and others which are less standard, and these are used at different times and in different contexts. This may include regional or non-standard varieties, which tend to be spoken only, and not written, and speakers of these varieties may at the same time be perfectly literate in the standard. Secondly, while literate people may use a given country's "standard variety" for all literacy-related activities, this does not mean they speak that same language at home. In heavily colonized regions such as the Americas, Africa, and Australia, 'literacy' usually means 'literacy in the dominant language', generally English, French or Spanish. While some of the Indigenous languages may now have literacy traditions, these are rarely the countrywide 'standard', conventions tend to be less standardized, and statistics on literacy rates in non-dominant languages are usually lacking. Because of this, we can't assume that literate people conform their speech to the written form, because these might involve completely different languages or dialects. So, we need to separate out whether we are asking about: 

This is a very broad question, and you are seeking information on two different topics. The first is about which language people actually use, and the second is about whether or not a given language being used is less (or more) susceptible to change due to its use online. Here are a few things to think about that may help you to narrow down your question to something that can be answered more easily :) There is no work that will give you an answer like "A 2005 study showed that the decline in number of people speaking minority dialects is highly correlated with the number of internet users", as per your example. It's too soon for us to know about a lot of these things, and even though there are many pieces of research that touch on these issues, it is not something that can easily be directly addressed because there are so many variables. A raw number of internet users wouldn't tell us much, especially about users of minority dialects; while internet access is pervasive in the Western world, in many places it is patchy or nonexistent, particularly in linguistically diverse parts of, say, Africa or Papua New Guinea, where a great many minority languages are spoken. People investigating a correlation between internet use and the use of a minority dialect would need to look at it from a very localized perspective. (Also, there are bigger threats to minority languages than the internet - the use of dominant languages in educational and professional contexts exerts quite an influence on people's choices about which language to use.) It's certainly true that a number of dominant languages have a big presence on the internet, and are in many cases preferred for online communication for various reasons (because the content is in those languages, or the scripts used for the orthography are better supported, or the people you network with use that language). But, at the same time, the internet provides minority languages the opportunity to have a presence that would not be possible if we still relied on print media (books, letters, etc.) With the internet, it's possible for anyone to publish anything, in any language, at no cost. Language documentation and language revitalization projects often make the most of this by putting language materials (stories, online dictionaries, etc.) on the web, so that the people who speak the language can access them. Of course, this doesn't necessarily mean that people will be using the language online, but anyone can start a blog, discussion group, facebook page, or whatever, in any language they like. There is a large amount of freedom here, and all that is required is that speakers of a given language are still actively using it, have other speakers to communicate with online, and that their writing system is supported by whatever technology they use. For example, online forums and websites are credited with encouraging and facilitating the increased use of Welsh during its revival (which continues), particularly because it gave people opportunities to continue to use their Welsh even if they lived in the diaspora. Regarding the question of whether or not the internet 'fixes' current forms of a language, well, this is another thing entirely (and too much to address in detail in this already long post!). But, I would be interested to hear why you think that the internet would 'fix' language - generally, people claim the opposite, and think that the internet is leading to the rapid evolution and degeneration of English, at least. Again, it's something that we can't make any big claims about yet, because it's still early to be observing any lasting effects of the internet on a given language. There are various changes that arise because of the nature of the medium (number of characters allowed in various contexts, types of writing systems allowed, the immediacy of communication) and various innovations that are internet-born (slang specific to certain user groups like World of Warcraft, use of hashtags to indicate topics) but we can't yet know whether these will last. Languages are constantly evolving, and this process is natural and generally pretty hard to stop. While putting things in print can contribute to the standardization of a written language, and provide 'norms', the internet is unlikely to do this - there is too much variation in how people communicate online. Think about all the different varieties of English (American English, British English, Indian English, Singapore English), the skill levels in these (i.e. many people using English are not native speakers), the varying levels of formality (many people write in a way that is closer to spoken language), and the diversity of topics and users (different corners of the internet have different slang, jargon, conventions, and standards). In sum: 1) too soon to know about a correlation between internet use and minority language use (other factors have bigger influences on this, and are difficult to separate out), and 2) too soon to know about the relationship between the internet and language change, but it's pretty unlikely that the internet will hold back the normal tides of change.
