It seems to me that you are reading the wrong books, essays, websites, w/e. For a start, you probably shouldn't read Armstrong et al when you are doing philosophy as a hobby for a few months. I do not mean to be an arse, I just think it is helpful to start exactly where your problems are, at the basic stuff. Consider me doing a bit physics as a hobby for a few months, now I pick up the latest Journal and naturally I won't understand a bit of it. Learning philosophy is a quite slow process. And it is not going to be any faster by skipping all the basics. Quite the opposite, you don't understand much and get confused by technical terms. There are books exactly for this situation, e.g: the Cambrdige Introduction to Philosophy-Series; The Math you need to do philosophy; Philosophical Devices; for logic check out this site: $URL$ There are almost for every discipline excellent readers, one being e.g.: The Philosophy of Language, by Martinich. It covers all the things you just mentioned, the most influential essays, good forewords that explain all needed vocabulary. As to my little example of me jumping into contemporary physics. The language of physics os mostly math. A lot of people, me included, don't understand a word (or number ;)). Think of philosophy as the same: Just because its language is our natural language, doesn't mean it is not as hard to understand as the physics-essay. 

Not sure if it is what your looking for, but since you tagged it as philosophy of science...: Imre Lakatos developed a theory to weaken Poppers falsificationism. According to Lakatos, theories are never isolated, but part of chains of theories. Each part of a chain is a theory that shares with the other parts its hard core, consisting of theoretical assumptions that cannot be abandoned or altered without abandoning the programme altogether. To the hard core comes a weak hull, consisting of auxiliary hypotheses. Auxiliary hypotheses are considered expendable by the adherents of the research programme - they may be altered or abandoned as empirical discoveries require in order to 'protect' the 'hard core'. One feature of the theory of lakatos was that he allowed contradictions in the weak hull, as long as they are not permanent. In this sense he would allow an inconsistent physics. 

Basically, the fallacy of accident is one of the ancient fallacies identified by Aristotle. It means wrongly applying a general rule to a specific, exceptional situation. The cited website (which is more than a bit confusing!) is using Biblical rules as an example because religious laws are often conceptualized as universal and exceptionless. The point is that even a Divine Commandment must be viewed with some kind of context. Even within the Bible, specific exceptions to general religious laws are frequently mentioned. The other example is meant to show that yes, sometimes general rules can rightly be applied; and therefore that citing a general rule for a specific situation is not intrinsically fallacious; it is often a good and valid form of argument. This makes sense, since most fallacies are superficially similar to good arguments --that's what makes them attractive. The overall desired takeaway is that there isn't any one approach to religious laws --that common sense and judgment must be used even in the interpretation of divine commands. 

This remains an open question in philosophy. It might be possible to objectively evaluate art, but it's difficult to claim that any given attempt to do so has proven definitive. There are hundreds of different aesthetic theories, and most of them are incompatible with each other to the point of disagreeing even on what counts as art. A random selection of just a few of the most influential includes Aristotle's theory of tragedy as emotional catharsis, Kant's theory of the beautiful as embodying purposiveness without a purpose, and Danto's theory that art is whatever the artworld calls art. Part of the problem is that most art theories don't age well --they don't predict or anticipate future innovations in art, and they often do a poor job judging newer or unfamiliar forms of art (as in your example of Adorno's dismissal of jazz). Without any agreed-upon standard, we might be left with vague intuitions and/or firm convictions that one piece of art outdoes another, but we can't justify those in any universal sense. It's worth noting that there are also any number of thinkers who claim that art is purely subjective, or that creating a standard of art is impossible or undesirable. This has proven at least as hard to establish, however, perhaps because of the difficulty of proving a negative. Furthermore, even some ardent proponents of artistic subjectivity have balked at the entailed conclusion that every piece of art is equal (that Bieber is as good as Beethoven, to borrow from your examples). 

Particular: a thing without properties. It has to instantiate universals(properties) in order to have a shape, a color, a taste etc. Individual: the red apple. It does not instantiate anything. In the ontology of someone believing in individuals (nominalists), there are no abstract things as properties, just individuals, and there are red individuals, blue individuals etc. The predicate just describes an individual, but does not denote an object. Trope: a trope is a particularized property. This apples redness for example. The tropes of this apple of course differ from the tropes of that apple. Universal: Redness, Shape, Length, Weight, whatever. Particulars instantiate these in order to ~have~ properties. 

I am looking for contemporary proponents of the following thesis: Identity statements such as "a = b" are to be interpreted metalingustically, for example as "the names "a" and "b" are coreferential". (as opposed to: "object a is identical to object b") I know that Frege hold this view in the Begriffsschrift and that he argues against it in the beginning of Ãœber Sinn und Bedeutung (On Sense and Reference). However, I'd like to know whether there are contemporary proponents who argue for a metalinguistic interpretation of identity statements. 

And here you can read the Introduction (on Sider's Homepage), which includes short abstracts for each chapter. 

Jonathan Schaffer is famous for his Priority Monism, or (metaphysical) Monism in general. He has worked on Fundamentality, Truthmaking and Causation among others. In 'Monism. The Priority of the Whole, he accepts the possibility of gunk. Is it known what exactly his view on modality is? 

To be an academic philosopher, you need to socialize with other academic philosophers (which is quite a skill), you need writing skills to write essays and books, and you need presenting skills to give talks at conferences. Furthermore, you need some source from which the ideas come which you write about and talk about. That may be creativity or something else. 

John Mbiti's seminal work "African Religions and Philosophy" is focused largely around oral philosophical traditions in Africa, although it has been criticized both for being insufficiently philosophical, and for perceived misrepresentations of the traditions it surveys. As far as other traditions --Socrates' philosophy was entirely oral during his own lifetime, as it was written down only by his students, (chiefly Plato). It seems clear that oral philosophy was very much current during and before that time in Greece. It's also fairly well-accepted that the Tao Te Ching first circulated in an oral form before being compiled into the form we know today. It seems likely there were other oral philosophical traditions in ancient China. 

Natural languages and formal languages are very different things, with different functions. Any formal language can at best cover a small subset of the domain of discourse of natural language, but with the advantage of eliminating ambiguity and providing strict definitions for validity and invalidity. There are formal logics, like formal mathematics, that have proven valuable for applications quite distant from their origins (for example, computer programming). It is not so much the case that possibility, fictionality and counterfactuality are necessarily more difficult, it is that they are outside what can be fluently covered by traditional logics. New and different kinds of formal languages called modal logics needed to be created in order to translate such concepts. How well they succeeded is a matter of opinion, but keep in mind a formal language concept is never an exact translation of a natural language concept, but only at best a plausible approximation. 

This can be a logical fallacy --any attack on an argument that isn't actually related to the strength or the premises of the argument is a fallacy, by definition. If I make a claim, and you criticize it without an alternative, that does not mean that any correct points you make about my claim are invalidated. On the other hand (from a sociological viewpoint) it is a legitimate criticism of a person's overall contribution that they never produce any positive ideas --it just isn't a legitimate criticism of their actual arguments. 

Philosophers, especially in analytic metaphysics, often talk about the conceivability of things. Here are some examples: 

Yes, there are: The John Searle Lectures on the Philosphy of Language. All episodes are uploaded on youtube: $URL$ 

Humanity is not identical to the universe (universe is way bigger), although we are a part of it. So you can say: A little part of the universe is trying to discover the universe. 

How does philosophy study the fundamental problems mentioned above? As already pointed out in the comments: Philosophy does use a critical, generally systematic approach and it does rely on rational arguments. Logic as well as mathematics play a big role in philosophy. For example if it wants to study what mind is. Where would the examples come from? The examples come from our everyday life and from the sciences. Philosphy goes hand in hand with science in a lot of disciplines. Take for example Descartes Meditations. It shows very good how philosophy can work from everyday common life to a foundation for everything, and also a proof for god (if he is, or better, would be, right). Another big source are intuitions. I have the very strong intuition that I think. That presupposes a being. Therefore there is a being. Based on which truth and facts would philosophy make an argument which would be true? This is kind of answered above. Note that an argument always has a conditional form. It tells you that if the premisses are true, then the conclusion is true. It may very well be that the premisses are wrong, or will shown to be wrong somewhen in the future. Maybe this link will help you: It is the article about metaphilosophy on the IEP. 

This is a variation on the well-known puzzle of the two brothers (one lies and one tells the truth, but you don't know which is which) and has the same general solution --you effectively have to route the answer through both conditions to arrive at a knowable truth state. "No, and if this was opposite day, I would say the same." In the case that it was opposite day, you would answer: "No, but if this was opposite day I would say that it was." The "No" can be dropped, the key is that the second half of the statement ("I would tell the truth on opposite day") has a knowable truth value regardless of the current day. 

This is the nirvana fallacy, when a solution is rejected because it is not perfect. It's also related to the sorites paradox, which is the concept that adding individual grains of sand can never result in production of a heap. 

This isn't a question with a single, universally endorsed answer, but one with a long history of debate. The field that encompasses study of knowledge is called Epistemology. One of the most foundational definitions of knowledge, credited to Plato, is that knowledge is "justified, true belief," meaning that you believe something AND the something you believe is true AND you have a good reason for believing it. If you accept this, then you know you know something when you have a justified true belief that you have a justified true belief about something. This definition has often been challenged, however, see the above link for more info. 

I cannot give a non-opinion based answer to your two explicit questions, but I can give you some context for the second: This is a ancient and durable argument for either idealism, which is the concept that spirit is more fundamental and "real" than body, which is somehow generated by spirit, or dualism, which is the idea that both body and spirit are real and neither reduces to the other. One influential version of the argument is by Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna), and called the "floating man" argument. It asks us to imagine being created floating in midair, with no sensory connection to the world around us. The mere fact that we can picture this, he claims, means that we are not solely bodies. Another version is considered by Descartes in his famous Meditations, namely Meditation I and II, in which he considers the phenomenon of dreams as a challenge to the reliability of the senses. His eventual conclusion that the most essential part of people is our souls, not our bodies, is in part an extrapolation from that, and other similar evidence. 

If P is actually true, it is true in this world. If P is possibly true, it is true in a possible world. If P is necessary true, it is true in all worlds. Therefore, if something is necessary true, then it is true in this world (and in all others). Edit: As the comments point out, I missed the core of your question. However, let me just add the relevant line: If P is necessarily possible, that means that it is true for all worlds that there exists a possible world in which P. This does not entail that P is true in the actual world. It is necessarily possible that I'm drinking a beer tonight. There is at least one possible world in which I am drinking a beer tonight. And it is true for all worlds that there is this possible world in which I am drinking a beer tonight. But: I won't drink a beer tonight, to demonstrate to you that necessary possibility does not entail actuality. 

Your questions assumes a lot. The contemporary conception of possible worlds stem from the work of David Lewis. On his account, Modal Realism, worlds are defined as concrete maximal mereological sums, all of which parts are spatio-temporally related. If you don't like Modal Realism (and no one really does), then, if you still want to employ possible worlds in your theory, one option is to think of them as sets of propositions. However, there is no reason to choose one of your two options. There is at least a third option available, namely, that a possible world is a set of propositions (probably closed under implication or so) that describe a possible scenario. As to your first option (list of propositions true now): This would render possible worlds useless for most purposes. One application of possible worlds is to talk about possibilities. But if worlds only consist in sets of propositions that are true now, then there is no possible world in which things are different. As to your second option (set of temporal events and propositions being true at each event), it is unclear what you need the events for. As I indicated in the second paragraph, worlds can just be sets of propositions. They describe how things could have been. Some propositions are about how things could have been in the past. Some propositions are about how things could have been in the future. Some propositions are about how right now things could have been different. For example, one propositions says that I am drinking tea in the kitchen. That proposition is false here, but it describes what could have been true. Response to your edit: I didn't find a quote to back this, but I think a possible world as a set of propositions is assumed to be a maximal description of (actual or) possible realities thoughout its full duration. This in a sense includes the other option, because maximal descriptions of single events will be part of a possible world in the former sense.
