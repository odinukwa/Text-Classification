In some companies, your team lead provides only technical leadership, such as choosing an architecture, deciding what will be in the next release, and so on. They are not your manager and are not supposed to give you a performance review. In these companies, the people who do give you performance reviews know that the team leads are closely connected to you (and your peers) and they can ask them "how is user1204089 doing? How is the skill level, how is the interest level?" Depending on what they hear from the team leader, they may talk to you and ask you how it's going or what they can do for you. This is very different from the team leader approaching them and saying "hey, user1204089 is just not interested in the work." It's even possible that after observing you and talking to you they have already concluded that your team leader isn't very good about providing information about you. It's important that you know who in the company is assessing and reviewing you. If it's the team leader, you can take steps to make sure that the team leader tells you as well as (not instead of, this sounds like you want to get away with bad performance) the higher-ups. If it's one of the higher-ups, you can mention to this person that you'd like more frequent feedback about how you're doing, and even ask whether the team leader is a good person to go to for that feedback. In other companies the team lead manages you, and is responsible for making you better. Some managers, who aren't good at their jobs, try to set up other people as "fall guys" by whispering bad things about them. If you have such a lead, my condolences. But the good news is that your higher-ups don't appear to be fooled. They are giving you salary increases and praise. Work as directly and openly with this lead as you can. For example, you could email the team lead, cc-ing a higher-up, saying "Ms Higher-Up mentioned today that you are worried I am not interested in learning that new database tool. I'm so sorry you got that impression. I would love to learn it. When can we meet to talk about specific steps and timing?" The most important thing to do is to keep doing a good job, and to have the confidence that you are doing so. The next most important thing is open communication with everyone around you. When the higher-ups bring you in for a discussion, see it as a good thing. Hear as much as you can and make sure they know where you stand and how you feel as well. Don't get into secretive or sneaky conversations behind anyone's back. 

and they push back. I think your best approach is to give up all hope of directly and explicitly suggesting anything general or overarching like "professional development" or "more training" or "bringing in consultants" as a vague concept. Instead, I think a highly specific suggestion has a chance of working. Some examples, which are probably not applicable to you but you can use them to construct ones that do apply: 

When something completely wrong is being said, and it would hurt the company for it to go uncorrected, you need to say something, but you can spare feelings: 

Thinking that way will never lead to happiness. While 50 is less than 60, it is a lot more than 0. Me, I ask people what they want to make, and either give it to them or don't hire them. I don't want people to tell me a larger number so we can argue down to what they actually want to make. Aggressive salary negotiation might have led to not getting the job, or getting the job but with a boss who's a little annoyed at you. You've done a ton of research and your salary matches everything, except for the possibly inflated or stale number from someone trying to persuade you to choose them for your education, and the perceived ease of getting the employer to say "I can get you 50". Those two pieces of information are just not enough to lead to any kind of dissatisfaction or feeling screwed. You're making decent money that you're able to live on. All is good. Keep working at this first job, keep learning about your industry and about salary trends in this area, and perhaps (perhaps!) at your first review, you might want to raise the topic of salary increases, should you come to believe you are underpaid. For example, perhaps your classmates are getting 50k plus benefits, and you are getting 50k without any benefits. But even if that's the case, don't spend between now and then sulking that you got screwed: spend that time figuring out how to earn a big raise here or land a spectacular new job somewhere else, by being great at this job. 

If you are offered the job, or in some cases during the interview, you will be asked "when can you start?" A reasonable reply could be "I am mostly free starting the 13th, however I have some personal commitments I am arranging that will require some time off. I could start on the 13th if I could have occasional unpaid days off for the first month, or I could start in a month if it's important to be there every day once I start." That said, if you take a job, take a few unpaid days to interview for grad school, and then quit the job within months, it will not reflect well on you. Is this a job that you will only keep until you get into grad school, or is it insurance in case you don't? 

But, and this is key, you require precision. Not a vague discomfort or wish for something newer, more fun, more interesting. What tasks do you want to stop or start doing? Do you want to be on a different project? To have more responsibilities? To learn a different language or platform or framework? To attend more conferences, take more courses, interact with customers more? Your manager has started this conversation but if your only contribution is going to be "well not this because I'm kind of fed up and bored" then your wishes cannot possibly be granted. And in that circumstance, confirming that you might have one foot out of the door may have cost you dearly -- for no benefit. The only way this conversation is worth having if is there's a possible benefit. That can only come from knowing what you want rather than what you don't want any more. 

Employers vary dramatically. I once hired an excellent candidate who approached me out of the blue. He had taken a week off when his first child was born, and after his first week back, declined to work on the weekend (allegedly optional.) His boss said to him: 

It's not clear whose beard you were discussing (your own, the complainer, or a third person) but I'll assume for now it was a third person. It's clear you can't see why anyone would be upset or offended at any discussion of someone's personal appearance in a work context. The other answers at the moment support this view, that of course it's terrific to sit around at work chatting about what people look like, and perhaps even extrapolating from that to matters you feel are related to appearance. Some comments a person might make after a colleague shaved a beard could easily be very distressing. Consider: 

Tell the manager you don't want to be spoken to like that. Consider adding a disclaimer that if you are performing your job improperly, you welcome being told that (including things like smiling more or making eye contact) but general statements attempting to categorize you and then complaining about the category are just not fair. Tell the manager if it upset you or made you worry you would be fired. Do not try to hide whatever emotional response her comments raised in you. How Jane is treating you is unacceptable. Especially in a large organization, you can be confident they won't accept it. How they handle it may vary, but you will not have to listen to blatantly prejudiced "people like you" comments any more. After you speak to your manager, make a note of the date and time, and of any promises the manager made. If the promises do not come true within a matter of days, you may need to escalate to a hotline run by your company, or the labour board in your jurisdiction, or some other public agency. Notes with dates are helpful in these cases. However, I strongly doubt it will come to that. 

Instead, why not redo the whole thing to show a hard working and dynamic person with more experience than most graduates? 

Looks fine to me. The thing the model is doing - pointing her face down and looking up, and opening her mouth - seems to be trying to "sexy up" this outfit but it's perfectly reasonable office wear. Good luck with your interview. 

As a speaker, I never want to be nitpicked or corrected. I can sometimes handle it when it's important and relevant for this audience. Usually, it isn't. Usually, I've decided to simplify things because I want to get a concept across, so it's not my lack of knowledge, it's a choice. And yes, I have been in the audience and cringed a little at things I have heard from the stage. Here's what I try: When the audience looks confused (and only when the audience looks confused) a question-as-suggestion may help without correcting: 

This is a really softball question. I mean, who is going to say "oh dear, I'm afraid I don't get along with other people at all" in an interview? An ideal answer: 

Obviously, it has to be true. If audit is tricking you by swooning and sighing and saying "well you could give us the raw data, but ah declare I don't know nuthin bout reporting no data so we would probably just have to bother you all the time to get the help we need" then you could be leading your department into doing more work than is really needed. Who knows how deep all the playacting and pretending does? Your boss can help you sort that out, too. 

Often you will get someone who very proudly tells you about their ultra rigid waterfall way of thinking complete with escalating to HR, or someone who delights in telling the time they prevented a release that had been promised, or elaborate hypothetical explorations of what they would do that are the opposite of what you know would be right in your firm. If you're lucky, someone will "light up" telling you about a scenario that's very much like one you've faced recently, and will describe doing something that would be right in your firm. Then you know you've found a good fit. If you're not sure, you could actually just tell them a recent story, and ask what they would do next. If they say they would write a memo to the CEO explaining why the customer couldn't have what sales just promised, you know you haven't found the right person yet. 

Illegal? Commit your time? You're accepting a meeting request, not getting married. After you leave, you'll be replaced, and the replacement will come to the meeting. The client needs to be able to plan and have continuity. If you agree that the meeting is a good idea, accept it. Then forward it on to your Manager with a comment like "make sure my replacement knows about this meeting." Separately, ask again when it's ok to tell the client you're leaving. It's quite common for that to wait until the replacement is found. This can leave you in a bit of an awkward position, but you have to just accept that discomfort and carry on. In your head, whenever they say "you" in reference to a time when you know you'll be gone, think "or my replacement" instead. 

Your boss is terrible at graphic design in general. The company is therefore doomed, and your worries about losing clients, looking bad on the resume and so on are all correct. Could you run the company better? In that case, don't tell your boss how to run the company he started, start one of your own. If not, go find a job with someone who is either better at graphic design or better at delegating to a talented professional (such as you.) Your boss is great at graphic design, but has a strange emotional connection to the college-era design. Relax. Startups pivot all the time, and in one of your upcoming pivots, you and your boss can make a new better logo. Focus on being great at your job and allow this little foible without worry. Graphic design is really not important to the business. You do some web pages and occasionally a logo, for people who don't know how to evaluate these things. You do good work but they can't even tell if it's good or not, and neither can your boss really. Relax, do good work, and don't fuss that the logo will hurt anyone. (Don't include it in your portfolio, though.) 

This behavior doesn't sound sneaky at all. It does however sound rude, and you say it's inaccurate. So I would look at her when she says something like that, wait a beat or two (silence adds emphasis) and then say: 

When it comes to answering, you can give a generic answer or you can name challenges. The problem with naming challenges is that it can bring you into areas that are not ok to discuss in an interview, such as your parental status, and can plant worries in the interviewers mind (sick daycare provider? sick more often because of germs brought home from school?) that were not there before. So I prefer a more generic answer in the interview for the child-related parts, but only after you do a very detailed analysis yourself. For the absence-related parts you can crank up the details and show that you consider things thoroughly. So think long and hard about before and after school care, your child being ill (and thus unable to go to school), the buses not running, you being ill, days the school gives the kids off that your workplace doesn't (Eg Easter Monday here in Canada, March break, etc) and have a plan for each and every one of them. And summarize to yourself what you have done to stay up to date in your field and all the non obsolete skills and experience you are drawing on. And then when you get the "confidence" question you say something like
