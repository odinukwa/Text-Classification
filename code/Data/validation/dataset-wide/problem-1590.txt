A friend of mine is a former prosecutor for the Crown/State. He's observed that it was often harder to investigate whether a deceased person was murdered when they own cats because the cats will eat the corpse of their owner. He also observed that dogs will starve to death before they eat their owner. While I don't doubt the veracity of his observations, I am wondering if is this a known phenomenon that can be generalized for all cats and all dogs, or just a sampling peculiar to his practice? If so, one must admire the loyalty of the dog and the survival instinct of the cat! 

According to The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime, in THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Vol. CXVI May 2001 Issue 2 by John Donohue III and Steven Levitt (one of the authors of Freakonomics): 

I have heard that taking an a pill of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA aka Aspirin) a day can help reduce the risk of heart disease, strokes, cancer and now Alzheimer's. From the linked article to WebMD: 

For children who attend pre-school between the ages 2 and 4, do they tend to have better immunities (and therefore get sick less often) than elementary-school children who did not attend pre-school, as was stated by this article on the Wall Street Journal: 

A more recent article, 2011, Airplane contrails worse than CO2 emissions for global warming: study states, citing a study in Nature Climate Change by Dr. Ulrike Burkhardt and Dr. Bernd Karcher from the Institute for Atmospheric Physics at the German Aerospace Centre: 

The answer, based on this study, is: Violent video games cause or correlate with an increase in violent behaviour. However, it's worth noting that this violent behaviour is offset by the distraction and release of aggression through playing of the (violent or non-violent) video games, resulting in an overall reduction in violent crime. While this study purports to answer the question, a lack of consensus is likely to remain on the topic. I think this study is, however, an important piece. — EDIT — I would also add a reference to the article No link found between movie, video game violence and societal violence (2014), which is summarized: 

No, The Register has misrepresented the story. There are several parts to this question. The summary is: 

"Peak Wind" is a myth: there is nothing similar in wind to how hydrocarbon stocks will get to such a depletion point that annual production will decline inexorably thereafter. The modelling methodology smackdown - Have previous estimates over-estimated the global onshore wind resource? This is currently unanswerable. There are two conflicting modelling methods - the aggregated micro-scale; and the meso-scale. The meso-scale modelling in this new Adams & Keith paper (and in the other related papers by Lee & Keith, and the Lee & Kleidon paper in Davephd's answer) cannot yet be validated, because there is insufficient information about the performance of wind farms greater than 100km2 in area - we haven't built them yet. Until we have real-world data on very large wind farms, we cannot say which modelling method is more accurate. Does it matter? No, it doesn't. There is a wide range of different estimates of global onshore wind resource, that are derived using different modelling methods. They all agree that the global onshore wind resource way exceeds global electricity demand, many times over. And in the absence of validation of meso-scale modelling, it will not get used for wind-farm design, which will continue to use micro-scale modelling. 

In "Radiocarbon evidence indicates that migrants introduced farming to Britain", cited in the above paper, Collard et al found that (from the abstract): 

From: "Indirect health effects of relative humidity in indoor environments." by Arundel et al, 1986: 

Each has their advocates. LNT is used as the cautious response to the uncertainties. The epidemiological evidence is complicated by several factors: difficulties in measuring the actual exposure received by very large numbers of people; and other things which affect health that correlate with radiation exposure. So, for example, Cohen 1995 found evidence against LNT: 

What: The first is which emissions one includes: just CO2, or the Kyoto basket, or all significant greenhouse gases. And how thorough one is in measuring emissions from land use, land use-changes and forestry (LULUCF), and of fugitive emissions from extraction, transmission and distribution systems, and flaring Where: Whether one attributes fossil fuels emissions at the point of extraction (rare, but not unprecedented), or the point of combustion. When: What time horizon one selects: and that's because the ratio of greenhouse gases, and in particular the ratio of methane to CO2, varies between countries; and the global warming potential of methane, relative to CO2, varies significantly, depending on whether one uses a 20-year horizon (56:1), 100 years (20:1), 500 years (6.5:1), or whatever. 

Maybe. According to this study, patients with congestive heart failure tend to unconsciously avoid sleeping on their left side, whereas healthy patients don't display this avoidance. The reason for this avoidance is unknown, though the paper offers several lines of speculation, ranging from discomfort to various forms of cardiac impairment. As far as I can find, no one has yet followed up on these and even if the reason is the impairment, whether this extends to healthy people is an open question. Though not directly related to the heart, sleep apnea is frequently (about half of cases) position dependant (i.e. Apneas only occur when in a certain sleep position). In persons with sleep apnea dependant on the left side, sleeping on the left side would have definite deleterious effects, including cardiac ones. This study investigated the frequency of associated positions with sleep apnea, though the actual numbers are behind the paywall and out of my sight. 

According to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, yes. As of September 15, 2013, they reported that there were 54,397 persons over the age of 100. Though they have previously had issues with their records, recording as alive persons that had actually died years before, such as the case of Sogen Kato, who was on their records as being alive for 30 years after his death. 

A study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition did find that Lycasin-sweetened candy did produce an increased prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms (bloating, flatulence, rumbling, colic, and watery feces) in adults compared to a sucrose control and the prevalence increased with serving size (40g vs. 25g). Isomalt candies also produced similar effects. It seems plausible that if you ate considerably more of the candy (40g really isn't all that much. I routinely see what are presumably intended as single-serving packages of candy 4 times that size or more), the symptoms would increase in prevalence and severity. 

The picture was purportedly taken in Dodge City, Kansas (Popular culture's quintessential Wild West town, populated by figures such as Wyatt Earp and the setting of fiction such as Gunsmoke), in 1878. Is this image genuine and firearms were prohibited in Dodge City? 

No, it should not be convincing to anyone who cares about using data meaningfully and scientifically. Raw ambient temperature data is seldom useful in and of itself. Particularly when: 

The evidence is a combination of analysis of: isotopes in diets, dental caries, and pollen. The paper sets out theories which have different timelines for the farming of crops, but those differing theories are mutually consistent in referring to some crop-growing going on before 1500 BCE: cultivation of crops seems to have been introduced around 4000 BCE. Here's the relevant part of figure 2 from that paper (data about wild foraged food cropped off from the top): 

as Adams and Keith do in the paper in question (and as Keith & Lee do, and Lee and Kleidon do). This is to a degree a question of faith, as to whether the parameterization, in throwing away the detail of the individual turbine, adds to, or detracts from, the usefulness of the model. It's a question of faith, because as yet we don't have enough data from wind farms over 100 square kilometres to validate the meso models. It's an interesting discussion about the fundamentals of atmospheric modelling, not least because Mark Z Jacobson is the man who literally wrote the book on it. His papers on the subject are listed here. 

By ignoring all of those changes, by stripping out the data corrections as Watts et al do, information is stripped from the data. So whatever is claimed to be shown by the uncorrected data, is no longer meaningful. No conclusions can be taken from Watts et al. Not about underlying trends, nor about urban heat islands, nor about differing trends at high-quality and low-quality stations. The only thing the paper shows is that its authors have failed to do rigorous scientific analysis. Sources 

Does it matter for (inter-)national policy? There are no implications for (inter-)national policy. Earlier estimates are of a global wind resource at least an order of magnitude greater than global electricity demand, so a quartering of that resource (as Adams & Keith predict) still results in potential global onshore wind production exceeding global electricity demand. That is to say. there is still no meaningful limit on the onshore wind resource. And that's ignoring the massive potential in the offshore wind resource.
