Actually she wasn't able - the Israeli army of that time was quite far from being mighty. It was a more or less hodge-podge assembly of what they could assemble during the British rule and what they could import just after the British left. The thing is (as other replies pointed out) that the invading Arab armies (with the exception of the Arab Legion from Transjordan) weren't any more mighty, even less so. During the British era prior to the Independence there was a ban on weapons so what they could smuggle in and hide from the Brits were quite limited in quantity and quality. But even that time there were local conflicts between Arabs and Jews and it was clear that the moment the Brits leave there will be a wide-scale open conflict. So they built up paramilitary militias (like Haganah) which later during the war served as the core of the new army (other replies give a good view on this) and tried to arm themselves: smuggle in weapons and also manufacture them while hiding all of these from the Brits. E.g. they exported civilian airplanes to use in agriculture then secretly converted them to military use - once the Brits left these converted civilian airplanes formed the first batch of the new Israeli Airforce. They manufactured weapons, copying the British arms (like the Stern machinegun $URL$ ) or even inventing new types like the Davidka mortar which wasn't really of any use as a mortar but was loud and scary which made it quite useful in scaring the enemy ($URL$ Another preparation for the war was that the Jewish Agency tried to buy up weapons they could get in Europe and in the US. They could buy up a variety of weapons, usually outdated or inferior versions of more modern weapons (like the Czechoslovak Avia S-199 $URL$ but as the enemy wasn't equiped any better it gave the Israelis quite the edge during the war. The Jewish Agency made a deal with Chechoslovakia, purchased arms from them and had them store them in Chechoslovakia. They smuggled in what they could during the British rule and started to transport the rest (like the airplanes) once the British left ($URL$ This was called Operation Balak ($URL$ 

The area of Europe is given as 3,931,000 square miles. If between one half and one quarter of that was divided into manors in medieval times, that gives about 982,750 to 1,965,500 square miles of manorial land. One site says that the average (English) manor was about 1,200 to 1,800 acres. With 640 aces to a square mile the average the average (English) manor was about 1.875 to 2.8125 square miles. Thus manorial Europe might have had as many as 349,422.22 to 1,048,266.6 manors. The site on medieval manors says that England after the Norman Conquest in 1066 had over nine thousand manorial estates. Medieval England had an area of about 50,346 Square miles, so the total area of manorial Europe should have been about 19.519 to 39.038 times as large as the Kingdom of England and thus should have had about 175,679 to 351,358 manors. $URL$ So there should have been hundreds of thousands of manors in medieval Europe. Most manors had a manor house where the lord of the manor and his family lived full time if it was his only manor or part time if he owned a bunch of manors. The total number of castles in medieval Europe is unknown but must have been in the tens of thousands. Each castle was supported by the neighboring population of one or more manors. A castle might have tens of persons defending it and/or taking refuge in it during a siege, or sometimes hundreds, or in a few cases thousands. If a lord of only one manor was besieged in his only castle, the besiegers might do enough damage to his peasants and his property to ruin him financially. The original question asks about a ruler, and that seems more important than the lord of only one manor. If "ruler" means an important feudal ruler like a count, Duke, Margrave, etc., there were only a few hundred or a few thousand of them at any one time in medieval Europe, so an average one might have at least tens of castles and at least hundreds of manors in the territory he ruled, though most would be owned by his subordinate lords. And if: 

$URL$ Charlemagne instituted schools to educate members of the nobility. Charlemagne's native language was probably Old High German. 

MichaelF, to answer the second part of your question, or just maybe an aside to your post, St. Petersburg was originally created by Peter the Great who was seen as extremely progressive, and had an interest in western culture. St. Petersburg was originally, as DVK had stated earlier, swamp land. Peter needed to fill in this area with sand and clay in order to build his city. With that said, the capital was moved from Moscow to Peter's new city during his reign. Although this was the capital until the 20th century, the coronations of the rulers like Catherine the Great and Peter III were still conducted in Moscow. Nonetheless, the anti-capitalist Lenin had no interest in moving the capital back to the "westernized"city. Before it was Leningrad, it was Tsar Nicholas II who changed the name of St. Petersburg to Petrograd. Nicholas was a arguably a patriotic Russian who wished, during WWI, to separate the west from Russia. It was also mentioned by that it was moved away from the front during WWI. Interestingly enough, from what I can remember, Kiev was originally one of the first Christian (Orthodoxy) cities in the east founded by St. Andrew. As many may know Russian Orthodoxy was an important part of daily life for many residents in the Empire and was the site of celebrations and pilgrimages for affluent Russians while the Empire existed. So, it is not surprising that someone may suggest that Kiev could have been the capital city of the Russian Empire. As for my sources it is knowledge from Robert Massie's biographies: Nicholas and AlexandraPeter the GreatCatherine the Great These are some really interesting conversations! Keep it up! Also, super great input from everyone! 

While looking up family history I found an old German marriage document which specified a dowry of "1000 Franks." With that, the families in question were from the Suggental/Waldkirch area in what is today the German State of Baden-Württemberg in the northern parts of the "Black Forest." The two possibilities I can think of is that either they used Swiss or French Franks or Francs because they may have moved from either area, or there might have potentially been some sort of Swiss or French influence in the area. The latter, to me, does not seem as possible. 

$URL$ What language are these title from 13th century documents written in? Almos t all are in Latin. They show that many documents in Catholic European countries were written in Latin. 

$URL$ $URL$ The Naples government's use of the title of "King of Hungary, Dalmatia, Croatia" began in 1519, when the King of Naples (future Emperor Charles V) inherited his grandfather Maximilian I's lands and claims, including the claim to be "King of Hungary, Croatia, Dalmatia". 

Did you ever hear of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars? A generation of on and off conflicts that devastated Europe and killed millions and changed everything. Wouldn't you expect that people and even their rulers were just a wee little bit tired and frightened of killing and war after that? Thus the governments of Europe adopted the Congress system or Concert of Europe in 1815 which continued until at least the early 1820s and did not totally break down until the Crimean war of 1853-1856. They were reluctant to risk major European wars for most of the period before Russia sold Alaska to the US in 1867. And of course if Russia did decide to risk war with Spain by attacking Spanish colonies, how could Spain and any allies retaliate? They could send a fleet through the Mediterranean and Black Sea to attack and maybe destroy the Russian naval bases in the Crimea. And they could have used another tactic from the Crimean war of the 1850s and sent a fleet to the Baltic. What was the worst that a Spanish fleet in the Baltic could have possibly done? Captured the city of Saint Petersburg that just happened to be the Russian capital, that's what! After Mexico became independent in 1821. Russia could have invaded and taken over California. But if the Russians landed a brigade or something in California the Mexicans could have sent a division or two to recover California. And possibly Spain and other European powers might have sent ships and soldiers to help drive the Russians out of California. In the 19th century Russia and the USA were often on good terms. But if the Russians conquered California they would soon lose American friendship and suspect that the US government as interested in sending an army overland to take over California. 

In college, I completed a paper that described the fighting between the Ustasha (ultra-nationalists), the Chetniks, and Tito's Partisans (communists) during WWII. I studied, briefly, the 20 years leading up WWI to 1945. With that, the thing I can recall as being the only option following the dissolution of the Austrian Empire was the formation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (KSCS) which took place in 1918. Leading up to the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, the area in question was generally dominated politically by the Orthodox Serbs followed by the Catholic Croats who were in constant competition. Nonetheless, leading up to WWI, this area, with only a small portion of northern Serbia, was encapsulated by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Many historians blame the outbreak of war on the Slavic-nationalists in the Balkans. More specific, Gavrilo Princip and the Black Hand a Serbian-national group. With that being said, I find it hard to understand why they would eliminate the Austro-Hungarian Empire and replace it with a Serbian Empire per se. From what limited information and the the map that was posted by Огњен Шобајић, the "greater Serbian" state model would seem to eliminate the possibility of a representative or even potentially quasi-federal body that the KSCS had established. Rather, it suggests a politically and religiously dominated Serbian State which would be in conflict with areas like Bosnia and Herzegovina who were minorities in both aspects. If they were to use the greater-Serbian model, it would seem to hinder, rather than, help the Balkans. It would be interesting, if this was a real possibility, as to what this area might look like if they used the "alternative" option. Unfortunately, there is not a ton of scholarship on the issue which makes topics like this relatively convoluted and difficult to discuss with often time alluding to speculation. That said, I did have to look a bit of information on wikipedia-- do not think less of me! If anyone has more suggestion or better insight, please feel free to correct me. It has been a while since I discussed the topic. 

Would you consider the partitions of Poland by the Russian Empire, Prussia, and Austria in the 18th century?
