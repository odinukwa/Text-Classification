What I've found is that I get back pain when I'm too stretched out. That is, when the reach is too much for me, I get back pain. You can see the measurement I'm referring to in the picture below. 

Your measurements show that you have a longer reach than I have, but shorter legs. My bike is a nominal 53 cm (refer to the sizing chart) but the virtual frame size (the size if the TT was level) is a 56. I have it set up right now with the saddle at 70cm above the center of the BB and the reach set at 62 cm. As for you, because your arms are longer, I think you would probably like the 54 better, but I do believe you could ride the 52 comfortably, perhaps with a slightly longer stem. My guess would be that the stock stem is 100mm. 

It sounds like you have your weight far too far forwards when braking. My reasoning comes from 3 things: 

Just got back from a ride. On my way back, my rear tire suffered from a side wall blow out. The area that went looks like it has been completely shredded. The area feels like it's been melted, with sticky melty rubber covering it. The tire itself hasn't done 500km, I got it last summer, but haven't been able to ride much. There really shouldn't be any reason I know that the tire failed. The tires are Michelin Pro4. 

So while I will agree, new steel-framed bicycles can be expensive, not all are. Regarding new steel-framed bicycles, not all are totally pricey. In 2011 Specialized was selling a steel Allez, which was around $650 IIRC. BikesDirect also sells a number of steel-framed bicycles for less that $1000. You can go up from there... 

I have not used the bike as a commuter, but I have put around 1400 miles (2250 km) on it in the past few years. It's a great bike, very well-built, with gearing similar to yours. I use it as a townie, when riding with the kids, etc. My only real complaint is that the handlebars are flat. For short rides, I can live with that, but for longer rides (>20 miles/32 km), I don't like it at all. I like moving my hands around on the bars as I ride. I've even considered putting some road bike handlebars on it, just so I could move my hands to different positions when riding. The only things which have stopped me from upgrading significantly are 1) my Peugeot weighs around 35 lbs (about 16 kg); 2) it would be difficult to use the current brake levers and shifters on road bars; 3) in for a penny, in for a pound: if I am going to upgrade, why dick around? In other words, I would want to get rid of the heavy bolt-on wheelset, the drivetrain, everything. That means some serious dollars. The frame on that Peugeot is Tange gaspipe, which rides great, but I think putting big dollars into upgrading would, in some sense, be like perfume on a pig. It borders on false economy, considering that a much nicer, lighter, more modern bicycle can be had for just about the same money. The Meridas you linked look OK, and if you can afford decent components, that might be a good choice. Here in the USA, you can get some pretty decent deals on similar bicycles from online sellers. I don't know if there are equivalents in Australia. But if I throw in my $0.02, assuming you will be riding the bike a lot-- commuters can really rack up the miles-- and that you can secure the bicycle adequately at work, I'd encourage you to get a full-on road bike. I know of riders who went with a hybrid bike and regretted it later, as evidenced by their road bike purchases, but I don't know of any who went with a road bike and later decided they would be better off with a hybrid. If necessary, make do with what you have at the moment, and save for a better bike. 

Also, it was raining. Water, reduces grip. When you tried to brake with your rear brake, you had no weight on your back wheel, AND you had very little grip. THEREFORE, there was no friction (slippage). When you tried to brake with you front brake, you had ALL your weight on your front wheel, and very little grip. THEREFORE, MUCH MUCH MORE friction. Your BIKE (not you) slowed down. However, since your weight was already far forward on your bike. Your bike slowing down, causes you to be FURTHER forward on your bike. At some point, your bike stops, and you ... don't... By shifting your weight further back, you give yourself more time to react to your bike slowing down. You weight down your rear brake (giving it more friction/braking power). Put yourself in a better position to brace against your bike. 

New road bikes are generally available from two sources: your local bike store (LBS) and online. Not all brands are available from both types of distribution channel. That makes it harder to compare apples to apples. Too, your LBS/brick & mortar retailer probably has a clearance sale starting sometime around August where they attempt to clear out inventory, so they can make space for next year's models. If you want to compare apples to apples, keep that in mind. You can get some very good deals in this way, which can be hard to beat online. The online-only sellers almost never have any kind of substantial sale. In light of that, let's look at a couple of examples. Lynskey Helix with full Ultegra drivetrain ($4950 assembled) vs. BikesDirect Motobecane Le Champion with full Ultegra drivetrain ($2100 assembled). These bikes are very comparable in many respects. Both have a titanium frame, but the Lynskey frame is made in the USA, whereas the Motobecane frame is made in Taiwan. The Lynskey frame has a certain cachet among cyclists which the Motobecane frame does not have. If you were to compare the two frames side-by-side, you may find that the welds on the Lynskey are slightly prettier than the welds on the Motobecane. (The frame builders at Lynskey might be using multiple layers of weldment to help achieve that.) The other components are pretty comparable; I own and have ridden many miles on both the Aksium and Equipe wheels, for example, and there isn't much difference. The fork on the Lynskey is nicer and more expensive, but apart from that, all the components are entirely comparable in terms of price and quality. You can read online reviews of both bikes, and they both review favorably. The price for the Lynskey, however, is $2850 more. This is sort of an apples-to-apples comparison, in that both bikes are available online and you can get them through certain dealers. Take another trio of road bikes and compare: Trek Madone 4.7 with a mostly-Ultegra drivetrain ($3150 MSRP) vs. Specialzed Tarmac SL3 Expert with a mostly-Ultegra drivetrain ($3900 MSRP) vs. Motobecane Immortal Force with a mostly-Ultegra drivetrain ($1600 MSRP). Look at the specs for each of these; you have nicer wheels on the Specialized, and there are other differences. But all the frames are made in Taiwan, so far as I know. A big part in the price difference comes from paying for the distribution channel. The dealer has to make a profit to stay in business. Trek & Specialized are mainly distributed through brick & mortar retailers; BikesDirect has some brick & mortar retailer distribution, but mainly they sell online. Full disclosure: I ride a Motobecane Le Champion with the titanium frame; I have about 4100 miles on the bike, and I'm totally happy with it. I also have a Trek Fuel EX 8 that I scored on clearance from a brick & mortar retailer. So I have no problem to buy either way. Bottom line, you have to decide how much you are willing to pay for brand name cachet and LBS support. But I think it is fair to conclude that the dealer-centric brands cost more. 

Use should use anything EXCEPT the bell. Here is another case where legislation has not caught up with scientific reasoning. In many countries the bell is a mandatory piece of equipment, which leads many to believe in its efficacy in increasing safety. The bell actually lowers safety. A typical bell rings with a very pure tone. The result of which is that a bell typically has a long coherence length. This means that sound changes very little with respect to time and space. When the tone does not change very much with respect to space, both ears will hear exactly the same thing. This makes it very difficult for the brain to pin point the direction and range of a bell. This should be evident with any cyclist who has seen pedestrians who actually DO hear the bell, but fail to locate the source in the time it takes to close in to the pedestrian. Another example of the phenomenon is when you try to locate the source of electronic buzzing. No matter how annoyingly loud it is, it is extremely hard to locate. This is because electronics buzz at a very precise 50/60Hz of your local electricity company. In UK, emergency services now employ brief spurts of white noise as part of their sirens, specifically because white noise has a very short coherence length. The result is that many people do not hear the bell because their subconscious filters it out because it does not immediately recognize that the information is directed at them. Use anything with a shorter coherence length than a bell My advise is to employ any sort of sound generation equipment that has a shorter coherence length than a bell. Typically anything mechanical will have short coherence length (changes sound often). Systems that work effectively 

If the tubes you're using have removable valve cores, you can put some Stan's or equivalent in the tubes. Some tubes (Continental is one brand) have removable Presta valve cores. Alternatively, you can buy tubes that come pre-filled with sealant. I'm not a huge fan of Bontrager products, but I've used their sealant-filled tubes around Southern CA, where we have goat-head thorns among other things, and they work well for small punctures. 

I'm not sure if I follow you exactly, but I ride road and dirt. More to it, I ride my mountain bike on the road on the way to the dirt. Here's my $0.02. The tires on my mountain bike are inflated to about 32-35 PSI (2.2-2.4 bars), and they have a lot of rolling resistance on asphalt. The sensation of riding on them is entirely different than my road bike tires, which are typically inflated to 105-110 psi (7.2-7.6 bars). The mountain bike tires feel like they are flat, even when I know they are not. I find myself looking down at them, wondering if they are still holding air. In my defense, on the mountain bike, I use tubes filled with a sealant, so it is possible for a puncture-- a thorn, maybe, or a piece of wire from a car tire-- to cause a slow leak. When you pull the thorn or wire out, there is a little puff of air that escapes, but the sealant usually closes the leak almost immediately. But it is not foolproof, and I can't shake the feeling the tires feel flat, even if I just aired them up before riding. 

Look at any high end bike and you will find hydraulic disc brakes. There will be people who argue the pros/cons of hydraulic vs mechanical disc brakes but it's hard to deny what the entire industry is putting on their most expensive rigs. For ease of stoppage, minimal brake fade and ease of modulation - the hydraulic disc brake wins hands down. You can hammer downhills w/ disc brakes all day long and your hands don't get tired... try that with old school cantis or v-brakes. Plus - disc brakes will maintain stopping power in wet vs a rim brake which will definitely be compromised in wet. 

All the advice given by the other responders is sound. I'll tell you about a bike that I got off Craigslist before I really knew anything about bikes. It was an early-80's Trek road bike. Externally, it looked OK. Some paint scrapes, a little rust-- on top of the top tube, around the cable-routing braze-ons, for example-- but it was a nice bike, back in the day. Expensive when first sold, and not quite cheap when I got it. What was wrong with it? The wheels were true, but they had a hop, like a high point (the rims were out-of-round). The bottom bracket turned out to be shot. There was internal rust in one of the seat stays that prevented the Weigles Frame Saver I sprayed in there from passing all the way through. The saddle was cr@p. In order to get the bike ready to ride, I had to get new wheels, a new bottom bracket, new cranks (I stripped the threads on the non-drive-side crank when trying to remove it), new tires, and a new saddle. But I learned from the experience, just like I learned a lot from my first car, which was a really bad car from the mid-1970's. If you're looking for a road bike, you should keep in mind that not only the wheel size has changed (from 27" to 700c), but so has the spacing between the rear dropouts. So unless you really appreciate vintage road bikes, you probably want to stick to something with at least 8 cogs on the rear cassette. That's not to say that all road bikes with fewer cogs are not good. I have a 1983-vintage road bike with a Japanese frame, really nice quality, and 27" wheels which I have put about 1400 miles on. It's a sweet bike. But the freewheel has 7 cogs, and if I ever want to upgrade it to brifters (from downtube friction shifters) it won't be hassle-free. If you're looking for a mountain bike or a hybrid, you should know that vintage freewheels are getting expensive, so I would probably be looking for something with at least 8 cogs on the cassette, as well. You can get some really good buys on 1990's vintage mountain bikes off Craigslist, especially if you're patient. Too, early mountain bikes had bolt-on wheels, which means you need to carry a wrench in case you flat. So if I were buying one, I'd probably look for one with quick-release skewers instead of bolt-on wheels. If you want quick responses to particular bikes listed online, you may want to try posting links here or over at BikeForums in the C&V forum. C&V gets a lot of traffic, and there are some very, very knowledgeable folks there. Were you to post links to, say, half-a-dozen bikes you're looking at on eBay or Craigslist, you'll get some quick feedback regarding what is wise and what is unwise. In this way, you can benefit from some of the experience of more seasoned folks. 

Your rear wheel skidded as soon as you applied a small amount of rear braking You flipped over the front as soon as you applied a small amount of front braking You were going downhill. 

You want to buy a Grid Tied Wind Inverter. These are pure sine-wave inverters that are designed to synchronize with a power grid and feed directly into you home's power distribution system. However, you should note, that these devices typically require permits to run; as a poorly maintained/designed system has a very high potential to electrocute power company engineers (they expect that the power line will be safe after they isolate it from the grid, not expecting you to own a small generator at home). Once you receive all your permits required, you can just hook up your bike to a small DC motor/generator and the inverter. Everything should work very simply. You should be able to get one of these inverters for about USD150 these days. $URL$ 

Float, which is the degree to which one can rotate one's feet while clipped in, can sometimes be an issue. In other words, all clipless pedal systems-- so-called because they replace the toe clips with cleats of some kind-- restrict the amount that you can rotate your feet while clipped in (i.e., while the cleat is connected to the pedal). This was the primary reason I switched from SPDs to Speedplays. Initially I rode using SPDs, but as the other respondents mentioned, I was getting hot foot on longer rides, and eventually some knee pain, which turned out to be caused by an SPD cleat that was slightly mis-aligned. That was the impetus, because with Speedplays it's not an issue at all. It seemed like a win-win to me: more float, and minimal alignment issues (provided the cleat is correctly positioned on one's shoe). But I am not a commuter. Here is the amount of nominal float one can obtain from various pedal systems, in no particular order:
