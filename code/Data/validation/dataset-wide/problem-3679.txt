The body can use about 31.4 Cal / lb of fat / day. This key statistic tells you a lot about your maximum rate of fat loss, because fat loss only happens when the body is using calories from your fat stores. There is thus a maximum rate of fat loss, and that rate is dependent on how much fat you have. If you have 25 lbs of fat on your body, then you can metabolize about 31.4*25 = 785 fat Calories per day. Meanwhile, a pound of human fat tissue is estimated to store about 3500 Cal. It might be a little higher or lower, but that is the number that is frequently thrown around. If you estimate your weekly fat calories at 785*7 = 5495 Cal/week, and divide that by 3500 Cal/lb, then you get a maximum fat loss rate of about 1.57lb/week. To avoid muscle loss, you should never run a deficit greater than what your body can make available from fat, or else you are guaranteed to lose muscle just to stay alive. Beyond that, you should train with weights and eat a high protein diet in order to prevent catabolism - the breakdown of muscle. Small and frequent meals to keep insulin levels constant is also believed to help. Another technique which is suspected to help but hasn't been proven is increasing your free testosterone, such as with a zinc supplement, or by abstaining from masturbation. The obvious indicator that you're losing muscle is that your muscles get smaller and weaker. I don't know of any others. 

Your program can be improved by simplification and emphasis on objective metrics of progress. Forget about creatine, BCAA, and other expensive supplements. You are so far away from your genetic potential that these are a waste of money. You can make incredible novice gains without them. (Multivitamin is a fine idea though.) Drop the leg press, anything with "curl" in the name, and all other isolation exercises. Having fewer exercises allows you to objectively measure your progress over time because you will be repeating the same exercises. Focus your mental and physical powers on increasing the amount of weight you lift with good form in these consensus exercises: 

This is a general question, but I'll give some specifics to fill it in. I'm on the Texas Method periodization program. On Monday, I was unable to complete the prescribed workout of a 5lb increase in the squat weight. In fact, I was just really weak on Monday. I hadn't slept and probably hadn't eaten correctly either. After the first set, I knew I didn't have a chance in hell of doing four more, so I lowered the weight by twenty pounds - and I still failed a rep in set three. I had no idea what I should do for the rest of the day. I just made something up - it doesn't much matter what, since I didn't know what the hell I was doing, but basically, I lowered weights on all the planned exercises. Not only do I not know what to do on a low performance day, but I don't know how to modify the rest of the week, and presumably the week after, on a periodization program. Please clue me in. 

You probably aren't going to like this answer, but this is the answer. You gain weight when you eat more calories than you expend. You lose weight when you eat fewer calories than you expend. You maintain weight when you eat the same number of calories as you expend. That's it. You'll need to find ways of keeping your calorie count down. For me this means no snacking, and always eating small amounts of beer, bread, jam, soda, potato chips, and the like. You'll need to stop thinking of tuna and cabbage as a temporary arrangement if you want to manage your weight successfully long-term. They are real food and they are the kinds of things you have to eat if you don't want to be fat. I suggest learning how to cook more kinds of healthy food if you aren't happy with tuna every night. EDIT: A few years have passed and I have seen a lot of stuff in the meantime. I am no longer sure that calories in / calories out is the whole picture of weight gain and loss. It's by far the most important factor but probably not the only one. 

Sources Endocrine response to masturbation-induced orgasm in healthy men following a 3-week sexual abstinence. This current study examined the effect of a 3-week period of sexual abstinence on the neuroendocrine response to masturbation-induced orgasm. Hormonal and cardiovascular parameters were examined in ten healthy adult men during sexual arousal and masturbation-induced orgasm. Blood was drawn continuously and cardiovascular parameters were constantly monitored. This procedure was conducted for each participant twice, both before and after a 3-week period of sexual abstinence. Plasma was subsequently analysed for concentrations of adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol, prolactin, luteinizing hormone and testosterone concentrations. Orgasm increased blood pressure, heart rate, plasma catecholamines and prolactin. These effects were observed both before and after sexual abstinence. In contrast, although plasma testosterone was unaltered by orgasm, higher testosterone concentrations were observed following the period of abstinence. These data demonstrate that acute abstinence does not change the neuroendocrine response to orgasm but does produce elevated levels of testosterone in males. Orgasmic frequency and plasma testosterone levels in normal human males. Twenty males participated in a 2-month study examining the relationship between 8 a.m. plasma testosterone levels and orgasmic frequency. Within subjects, higher levels of testosterone are associated with periods of sexual activity. Over subjects, however, the direction of the relationship is reversed. Mean testosterone levels were higher for sexually less active individuals. A research on the relationship between ejaculation and serum testosterone level in men. The authors found that the fluctuations of testosterone levels from the 2nd to 5th day of abstinence were minimal. On the 7th day of abstinence, however, a clear peak of serum testosterone appeared, reaching 145.7% of the baseline (P<0.01). No regular fluctuation was observed following continuous abstinence after the peak. Ejaculation is the precondition and beginning of the special periodic serum testosterone level variations, which would not occur without ejaculation. The results showed that ejaculation-caused variations were characterized by a peak on the 7th day of abstinence; and that the effective time of anejaculation, is 7 days minimum. These data are the first to document the phenomenon of the periodic change in serum testosterone level; the correlation between ejaculation and periodic change in the serum testosterone level, and the pattern and characteristics of the periodic change. 

It's true. Exrx has good breakdown of the muscles targeted by the bench press, incline press, decline press, and military press. The "clavicular" pectoralis is your upper pec. Most of the lifters I respect make fun of decline press as a pointless exercise (because dips are better). Also, most of the lifters I respect emphasize the importance of the standing overhead press as a functional movement. A nice little tip I picked up somewhere if you're trying to hit your upper pec is to do dips, but hold your feet out in front of you in a hollow body position. This kind of dip works your upper pec really well, and assists in the development of "slab like" pecs. Which are just way more manly looking than muscle globes. 

When you lift heavy deadlifts and squats, your whole body is under high compressive force. The muscles squeeze your blood vessels, which increases the hydrostatic pressure of your circulatory system. In other words, your blood pressures spikes up during the lift. The body attempts to restore homeostasis during the lift by engaging physiological responses which lower the blood pressure - mostly by releasing vasodilators, which are chemical signals telling the smooth muscles lining your blood vessels to get relax. When you finish the rep, your muscles relax, and the pressure drops suddenly - but the vasodilation response has been activated, and your blood pressures spikes down for a few seconds before the body can act again to restore equilibrium. It's normal - nothing to be alarmed about. All serious lifters have experienced this, including to myself. However, this physiological effect can lead to passing out, and passing out can be dangerous because you can take a nasty fall. It's also a reason to squat over a rack. Even if you think you could dump the weight if things got out of hand, you might pass out at the top of the rep one day, and then the only thing that's going to save you from a squashing is the rack. To mitigate this effect, work on your breathing. Having good breathing will give your whole body, including your brain, more oxygen. It won't stop the blood pressure spikes, but it will allow you to stay conscious at a lower blood pressure. Exhale strong and long after you pass the sticking point on the way up from the rep. (Say at the top 25% of the ROM). At the top, after you finish a full exhale, and while keeping your core tight and engaged, breathe deep into your chest and upper belly (diaphragm). If your vision is clear and your head is solid, take the rep. Otherwise, go through one more deep breathe cycle - without ever losing tension in your stomach. This is hard and takes practice, but you can do it. (It's the same kind of breathing for singing, by the way.) Note that lightheadedness during a rep, or prolonged lightheadedness after a set, cannot be explained by this mechanism. Only brief lightheadedness at the top of a rep or after the set is explained by this physiological response. 

The theory behind Texas and Madcow are the same. They were invented by the same people. You can see that Rippetoe takes a clear stance against more volume. If it's too easy to complete the workout, he would suggest upping the weight. Perhaps resting more time between sets on your volume day would allow you to do this. (He recommends "no more than 8-10 minutes" between work sets. That's a huge rest period.) The truth for me is that I can't even do 5x5 90% 1RM. The volume day completely crushes me at 80% 1RM. The main thing is that you to need to be sufficiently recovered from one Monday to the next so that you can increase the weight. If you can't do that, then you aren't doing the program. If you can do that, then you are following the program. If you can do that even with additional assistance exercises, then I would suggest dropping the assistance exercises and upping the weight. Even for badass lifters, there is definitely some amount of weight X that they can put on that bar such that they will be so taxed that the idea of assistance work doesn't come up. If a lifter is at a point where they are unable to fully tax themselves with a properly weighted 5x5 across, then they're probably still better served with a linear progression program. 

No, it's not necessary to do any kind of flys at all. You can become enormously strong and sexy just by doing basic barbell compounds, as I've mentioned in another answer to one of your questions. 2hrs is a long workout, many experts suggest more than an hour of work sets is counterproductive. But I mostly read strength literature and you're doing a bodybuilding routine. 

For me, the gold standard is whether I can use the device to time the Tabata protocol. That protocol is 8x(20s exercise, 10s rest). The most common exercise is sprinting. This is a difficult protocol to time. Your device must: 

The question is whether you can recover from the extra load during the rest period. If you can recover from the extra work, then that's great! You want to do the maximum amount of work that is recoverable. It is indeed a trial and error process to learn what you can recover from. I think developing that intuition is part of the sport of lifting, and it requires body insight. Also remember that your recovery potential changes based on what's going on in the rest of your life, particularly what you're eating and how you're sleeping. Now, if you know in advance that you can recover from 4x5 repetitions of a certain weight, then you might consider increasing the weight until 3x5 is the maximum number of sets you can recover from. I think varying the reps, sets, and weight is good for training. I suggest trying to increase the weights first, and going to more reps or sets when that isn't working. What is recoverable? Simply, will you be ready to lift more weight using the same protocol the next time you're scheduled to do so? E.G. for a Starting Strength routine, you have recovered from workout A if you can do more work during the next A-type workout. Keep in mind that if you lift 200 for 4 sets this time, then you haven't recovered until you can lift >200 for 4 sets next time (even though the program calls for 3 sets: you're tweaking the program when you add more sets, and there is nothing wrong with that, but you should compare apples to apples when you evaluate your recovery). 

Ideally, your knees travel out directly in the same line as where your toes are pointing, and your toes should be pointing out at somewhere between 20° and 45° from a line drawn perpendicular to your torso straight out in front of you. If your knees are collapsing in, yes, it is poor form. It indicates that you have relatively weak leg abduction. (Remember, abduction is any movement that draws a body part away from the center line of your body.) Collapsing knees are bad form; a little bit is not particularly dangerous to you, BUT strengthing those abductors will improve the total strength in your leg by efficiently using all muscles. Definitely work on keeping those knees out over the hips. Also, try mixing up your stance by going a few inches wider than you usually do, and you will find that you're getting more glutes and more inner leg muscles into the action. Which is a good thing - because ONLY the squat can really tax these muscles. Collapsing knees also tend to happen in conjunction with weight too far forward. As you collapse in, notice that you tend to pitch forward. Try various mental cues to fix this, such as, "Sit back", and "Squeeze out". Practice impeccable weight-in-heels form with your warmup sets and try to carry it into your work sets. If you can't do the exercise without knee collapse, then maybe you should take off a few pounds - or stay put for a week. 

The other difficulty with timing devices is accidental activation of the device. This happens frequently with watches if you are doing HIIT with barbell work or exercises with wrist hyperextension such as pushups or handstand pushups. Then your left hand frequently presses against the right side of the watch where the timing control buttons usually are. I have never found a watch that conveniently times my crossfit wods, and smartphones are too large and fragile for me to consider wearing one while in the middle of a high intensity workout.
