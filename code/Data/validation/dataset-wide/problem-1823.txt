I'd like to set up some port forwarding in our router, using UPnP. More specifically, I want to run some program on startup that always forwards port 8443 my IP address (192.168.1.100). Port 8443 is for our SVN server. How do I do this with Windows Server 2008 R2? (I don't want to go into the router to set up port forwarding, as everytime I do this, the router resets itself and we lose the internet connection for 5 minutes which plays havoc with everything else on the network) 

We have a server with 16GB of RAM. The memory manager is very aggressive in trimming back the Working Set for a particular process, which is resulting in a lot of soft page faults which is slowing the process down and introducing latency. Are there any settings we can change in the registry to force the Dynamic Memory Manager to be less aggressive with trimming the Working Set? We wouldn't mind if the server devoted 80% of its RAM to the Working Set of the processes (its only using 2GB at the moment). 

Put the attached script somewhere on your hard drive. Open FileLocator Pro Go to the scripting tab Activate the 'Filename' script and select the path to the script Put the value 240 in the 'Custom' field Make sure the engine field is set to "JScript" Click Search The result box will list all files where the pathname > 240 chars in length. 

Usually if you have bad RAM, either nothing happens (because the system ignores the bad ram), or the system goes along fine for a while, then core dumps. It's possible that what you're seeing is a fail over after a core dump...that would explain a temporary slowdown. If it's not crashing, the loss of 2gb of RAM would either cause a persistent problem, or no problem. Do you have any intermittent database jobs that might be slowing it down? 

I've got a problem with OWA, and I'm pretty much at the end of my rope with this. OWA authenticates perfectly on the internal network. No problems at all. On the outside, you have to log in two or three times before it "sticks" at which point it won't ask you to authenticate again for hours. The problem cropped up after an admin left and we were forced to change a bunch of passwords, so it's almost certainly a password/directory ownership issue somewhere. However, I've gone over the configuration and I can't find anything that's not running with a password unique to the local machine. The setup is Exchange 2003, running behind an Apache proxy. Since the problem is external only, I've gone over the proxy extensively, and I can't find any problems. The whole setup has been running fine for ~4 years, so again, it's probably tied to the password change (which shouldn't have effected the proxy in any way). I'm sure it's some stupid configuration setting that I'm missing, but I can't find it for the life of me. Anyone have any ideas? @PQD Here's mine: 

You can also use the "Reliability and Performance Monitor" that is available under Windows Server 2008. As you can see below, it automatically keeps a record of the reliability of the server, and assigns it a "reliability score" out of 10. This score starts at 10, and drops if the server experiences any crashes or unexpected shutdowns. It even keeps a record of which programs were installed, and when, so you can diagnose if an installed program seemed to cause more faults. You can also set it up to continuously log the CPU usage of programs, to see which program is causing the 100% CPU utilization. 

Update 2010-12-20 Tried MySQL v5.1, it didn't work either. Its amazing - if you type "mysqld /?", or "mysqld -help", it doesn't give you any help. And, if you try to restart the service manually, it doesn't display any error messages. Could it be any more unhelpful? Update 2010-12-21 Installed MySQL 6.0 alpha, and it worked. However, I'd rather not use an alpha release, given that the "stable" release is anything but :( Update 2010-12-21 Found $URL$ dealing with troubleshooting under Windows. Discovered that you can generate an error log if the service doesn't start - see here: $URL$ Update 2010-12-21 Aha! A clue. To actually see the error, add "--console": 

I'm copying 600GB of data from external hard drive A to external hard drive B. Windows Server 2008 R2 has notified me that 100 files have filenames that are too long (i.e. >255 chars). Is there a utility that can allow me to search for these filenames, and manually shorten them? Shane. 

Generally, the only reason to use a system-specific client is if the generic client doesn't work, or if there is additional functionality added by the custom client (For example, I use the Cisco client to connect to our VPN on Windows, because the Windows client is annoying to configure, isn't pure IPSec, and isn't as easy to use, but I use the built in Mac client when connecting from a Mac.) The security level is effectively the same for both. There is talk of vulnerabilities in the windows implementation, but it hasn't been broken. For SonicWall, I'd probably just use the built in client, if I could get it to work. 

In this case, I would be very surprised if the latency was appreciably increased by the switches. It's far more likely that latency would be increased by encryption overhead or actual light-speed restrictions than by switching hardware. 

47,297 is a prime number? See if it'll do 47293 or 47303. (I really have no idea. 47k bytes is trivial for that program.) 

Red Hat is one of the most popular business Linux distros. Fedora is nice, but Fedora is bleeding edge. There are bugs and issues that you'll have to deal with there that you'd never have to deal with with RHEL. Enter CentOS, which attempts to achieve the stability of RHEL with the openness of Fedora. 

MyUSBonly from AC Element Company and StopUSB from EverStrike will also work. Both of them ask for a password if you want to mount a new, unknown USB device. To be honest, both could be better designed, but at least they do the job. 

We have a contractor working offsite. We would like to set everything up so that his screen is recorded to our Windows Server 2008 R2 machine in real time. We've been using TeamViewer, but we've run into limitations. What would you recommend? p.s. Constraints: 

The problem is that I was starting with a drive full of data, and wanted to add a mirror of said drive. This will not always work, and the error it gives is meaningless at best, and misleading at worst. A solution is to start with two unallocated volumes, and select "New Mirrored Volume": 

Here is an example of shrinking a disk. This command line worked, in spite of the same command from the GUI failing: 

Now, do all of your access through the UNC file share, e.g. \computer\mydrive - RO\ I use this trick to provide an absolute guarantee that my file backup program won't inadvertently stomp on the data that its meant to be backing up. 

If you want to search for files "less than" simply change the script. For each result, right click on the file and select "Explore Here". Rename the directory path to shorten it, then repeat the search until there are no results at all. -----start file named "max path length search.js"---- 

Part of the biz is becoming a "fan" of whatever server configuration works for you. For a simple app, it really shouldn't matter, but you'll find that deployment and maintenance are better for this or that server. Maybe your linux distro has better packages for apache. Maybe it's better for nginx. Maybe you can't make the configuration work for apache. Maybe you can't make it work for nginx. If you're looking for a simple "This server is superiour" answer, it's just not going to happen. They can all be configured to work very well or very poorly, and anyone who has worked in the industry has seen both and formed strong opinions. That being said, I tend to stick with Apache. Nginx is a hot up-and-comer, so jumping on that is not a bad decision, but Apache is still the gold standard. 

That'll make it so you have to hit return to move to the next screen. Less and More are well and good, but who wants to page down through a 200,000 line file? 

You can't judge by the size of the file. If he ran on every table, the size of the database would be the same until he ran . I'd copy the file, and open it up in an editor, and see if there is actually anything in it. Or you could just try and SHRINK it. If it shrinks to nothing, it's empty. (Again, make a backup). A complete loss of all data sounds like a user problem to me. No backups, no data, mysterious virus? COULD be a virus, but it's just as likely it was user error. 

I once had this same problem as well. It turned out to be the hard drive controller on the motherboard. However, in this case it definitely sounds like a dud hard drive. Hard drives tend to hang onto life by marking sectors bad, transparently, in the background. When sectors finally start to go bad at an OS level the drive ends up expiring very quickly. 

I've run into a brick wall trying to install MySQL v5.5 on my machine. My PC is Windows 7 x64, Enterprise edition. MySQL installs fine, but when I run the "MySQL Instance Configuration Wizard", it pauses forever on the step "Start Service" (I can let it run for 30 minutes with no response). If I go into services, I see that the "MySQL" service hasn't started, and if I try to start it, it says "Windows could not start MySQL Service on Local Computer. Error 1067: The process terminated unexpectedly." I've tried the following: 

I was trying to create a mirrored drive in Disk Management, but I kept on getting this error: "All disks holding extents for a given volume must have the same sector size, and the sector size must be valid." 

If you want mail to go out in the background, use something that uses Sendmail in the background. Sendmail is part of most Linux distributions. Its a binary that sends mail. The nice thing about it is that control returns instantly to the webpage, and Sendmail will queue everything up to send in its own time. I wrote a shopping cart a while ago that sends an email once the shopping process is complete. I used phpmailer which in turn used Sendmail. Everything has been working perfectly since the day I switched to using Sendmail rather than a SMTP server. 

Is that not working? Can you check and make sure the files are owned by the group, and that the second group of permissions is at least r-x? 

Lot of sites reject mail if they can't do a reverse lookup on the host, so you may have to try several if your host doesn't resolve. If you still can't tell, you're going to have to learn to wade through the cf file (or show it to someone who can read it). Hope this is at least somewhat helpful. 

Short answer: Sorta. Long Answer: Exchange allows you to export messages and mailboxes with the Export-Mail command, but, of course, it only lets you export it to Microsoft's crappy PST format. From there you have a number of utilities that can break down the pst to text. It's guaranteed to be extremely tedious. John is absolutely correct. You'd be much better off downloading the mail programmatically using POP or IMAP. 

If you're blocking it through the AD, you're going to need to go to the "Active Directory Users and Computers", select the record for the computer in the domain, and go to the "Security" tab and remove everyone you don't want to have access. Might also want to go to "Local Security Settings -> User Rights Assignment" and make sure "Access this computer from the Network" is right, and "Allow logon though terminal services" as well. 

Right click on a directory, choose "Select Left Side to Compare". Right click on another directory, choose "Compare to". It lists all of the files in two vertical panes, showing the ones that are missing/changed/etc. You can then drill down into each pair of files to see the changes at a file level. 

Mount the drive as per normal. Right click on the drive, and turn on file sharing. Alter the permissions for the share to remove "write" permission. Leave "read" permission enabled. 

Is there any service which runs in the background, and does the job of prime95 (i.e. it tests server CPU/RAM for integrity now and again)? Regards, Shane. p.s. The reason I ask: we recently had some bad RAM on our server, which ended up slowly corrupting all of our business files. A file would be copied into memory, it would be corrupted in RAM, and copied back onto the RAID 1 hard drive in a corrupted state. 

Google "undelete for Linux", and you'll find something such as $URL$ You can use this to undelete any documents that you want to recover. Take a step to avoid this in the future. What you want is a method to make a copy of the partition, something like Acronis TrueImage for Linux. If you run Acronis TrueImage for Linux, it copies a complete clone of the hard drive to a file (which you can safe offline for safety), so you can always restore from the bare metal if anything goes wrong in the future.
