First, my own experience is that the cost of the new bike is generally a lot less than if you bought the parts separately. Second, you say you are very new to cycling. If you did go out and buy parts, how confident are you that (a) you'd be buying the correct parts, (b) you'd have the tools to fit them properly, and (c) you'd have the know-how to fit them properly? I don't mean to be at all derogatory to you when I say the last bit, I'm just pointing out that some of the work will be very challenging to a novice. Third, I don't know the Indian market, or really what type of bike you're looking for, but your budget doesn't seem that huge. As a third alternative, have you considered second hand? Of course there is an associated risk with this (buying a piece of crap, buying something stolen, etc.) but I'm sure with some research you could reduce these risks. You may even find shops which specifically sell used bikes (and therefore anything you buy will come with some kind of warranty). Shops like this exist in England although I don't think many main dealers bother with second-hand nowadays...too much competition from eBay. 

There's a couple of things here. First there are the physical properties of the groupsets. As you move up the groupsets, what you're buying into is essentially smoothness and lightness. But for a recreational rider, you'd basically need the groupset to hit a certain minimum level of quality, and anything beyond that would be lost by the rider. And my guess is that for many of us the minimum level of quality is probably even lower than 105 - Tiagra and these days maybe even Sora. In terms of reliability, you could also argue that there is an advantage to a lower-level groupset, because you're riding tried-and-tested technology rather than the "leading edge" technology used by the higher level groupsets (Dura Ace, Ultegra). So why do shops sell the top-end groupsets? I think there is a big psychological aspect to this, and this is my second point. On the one hand they are serving the interests of the top-end riders. But on the other hand, they are also catering for a huge bunch of riders (and I include myself in this category) who ride these groupsets simply because they can afford to do so. As @mattnz says in his comment, it is all about vanity. It's exactly the same reason a guy will drive a Ferrari when he could get get from A to B just as quickly (assuming speed limits are observed) in a Ford. Last, on a practical note, its worth saying that groupsets cost a lot less when bought as part of a bike, than they do when bought standalone. So if you're the type of rider who will say "if only I had a better bike I could smash my pb", you're better off by going for the superior groupset straight away - it will be cheaper in the long run than getting the lesser groupset and upgrading parts piecemeal. However, upgrading piecemeal is possible (albeit as I say at a premium). Just note that the current range of Ultegra (6800) is 11-speed, whereas the current 105 (5700) is 10-speed. So to upgrade a 105 part to an Ultegra part, you'd need to look at older (10-speed) Ultegra ranges (6600 or 6700) or even 10-speed Dura Ace (7800). But certainly 6700 is still widely available. 

Addressing only the technical compatibility, if you currently have a Shimano 8x3 setup, and you wish to upgrade to another Shimano 8x3 setup, then any Shimano 8-speed road parts should be fine. So that includes Claris, Sora, Tiagra etc. as long as it's 8-speed kit. Same goes for the chain. I mention Sora and Tiagra just in case you're able to source these "old" parts at a decent price, off eBay or something. 

I'm assuming that what you're actually asking about are the pros and cons of various rim depths, so will answer based on that. I would highlight Pt 2 of Ken's answer - dealing with crosswinds. The amount of resistance deep-rimmed wheels can offer could quite literally blow you across (off?) the road if you're not careful. Under those circumstances the shallower the rims, the more control you'll have over the bike. Conversely, when there is no wind to speak of, my own experience (I just bought some 6cm rims not so long ago) is that I feel I'm cutting through the air. (Actually its not just a feeling, my speed increase bears this out.) Beautiful. I have to say though that if I was looking for an all-purpose set of rims for "general use", I'd go for shallower rims - the all-purpose here being key. On the other hand if I were prepared to chop and change the wheels before every ride (depending on wind conditions), then under the right conditions a nice deep rim will feel amazing. One other thing worth mentioning - I've found the front rim depth to be more critical than the rear - this is probably obvious when you think about it. I haven't done it yet but I could imagine experimenting with my 6cm rim on the rear, but my 2cm rim on the front. 

Get the bike serviced, giving yourself enough time to thoroughly test it, so that if the service introduces any problems, you discover them long before your trip. There is no standard test for worthiness, you'll have to rely on your judgement. 

Out on the road its a mixture. But first, are you able to measure your cadence? I use this as my guide (i.e. I try and keep my cadence within a certain range no matter what the gradient) - if I am able to pedal comfortably at over 80rpm, then its time to change to a bigger gear. If I'm unable to pedal comfortably at 65rpm, its time to go to a smaller gear. That's my scientific approach. Alternatively, when it starts hurting I change down, and when it feels too easy I change up. But again I'm trying to maintain a constant-ish cadence. Climbing hills obviously takes it out of you as you're climbing them but generally speaking it should only be a short while (minutes) after you've passed the summit before you're able to pedal as normal. But over that kind of distance you'll need to take your nutrition seriously - keeping your energy levels up will be to key to allowing you to control your cadence. 

Clearly he's going to be using top-end kit, a dedicated bar rather than some bolt-on aero bars. But if you ignore that and look at his position, he is riding with dead flat bars - your first option, or close to it. I took a lot of photographs on that day and this was pretty much universal among the riders I watched. Unfortunately I have no idea why this is, so I'm only really offering an insight rather than a proper answer. When you look how low his hands are compared to his head, it is difficult to imagine that having his hands a few inches higher (i.e. using the second shape) would make any difference as regards aerodynamics. But there again, these guys will have spent hours in wind tunnels working on their TT position, so it is probably not a bad assumption to say that the position we see the rider in is pretty much his optimum position. So in terms of aerodynamics I would suspect your first bars are better, but I have no real idea why this is, other than that's how I've seen the professionals ride. 

I thought this was an interesting question, so first of all, +1. First off, the sloping tube (your second image) is known in cycling parlance as a compact frame. I found an article on the Giant web site about the advantages of a compact frame. When I say "advantages" - this is Giant's word not mine! The full article is here, but to summarise it: 

Your brake is a closed system, and your brake cable is filled with a mixture of brake fluid and air. Air is compressible, while brake fluid isn't. So, the larger the proportion of air in the system, the more compressible it will be, the more effort is required to actually stop the bike, and this is frequently described as "spongier". Now, in your specific case, you need to judge whether you have enough stopping power for the environment/conditions in which you ride. If the answer is "No", then topping up the reservoir (i.e. replacing air with brake fluid) might make sufficient difference. 

Getting a 7-speed (or indeed any) Campy cassette wouldn't do you much good anyway since the rest of your drivetrain will be Shimano. As you've discovered the two don't mix. (Or rather, they are not supposed to mix and you can expect problems if you do try to mix them. Never say never, I guess!) I reckon your cheapest option could be to visit your LBS and to see if it is possible to take the wheel you bought, and to swap the Campy freehub to a Shimano freehub. I have no idea how easy this would be or how much it would cost. Worst case the LBS may want to rebuild the wheel, although there could be an easier way, I don't know. Next option, as you've identified, is to get a new wheel with a Shimano freehub - any chance you could exchange the wheel you just bought? Normally there's no cost difference between the two freehubs. But as long as you have a Shimano freehub you should just be able to slip your existing cassette back on (provided you have the right tool). In terms of expense, I wouldn't recommend trying to fit the drivetrain to the wheel you just bought, that will mean several part replacements and costs will mount. You also need to be careful if you start thinking along the lines of upgrading your 7-speed cassette, certainly when you get to 10-speed, things like chains and derailleurs come into play, so you may need to replace more than you bargained for. 

So we have: Max. LuftDruck / Inflation: 4.5 Bar / 65 PSI These tyres are Continental, a German manufacturer, and the word LuftDruck means (surprisingly) air pressure. Note that this tyre is on my offroad bike (26") so will probably show different values to those on your hybrid (I'd expect 75psi or thereabouts, but you should check). For the frequency you should check the pressure: some people will say every ride, I generally go for every week or two for the bikes I ride regularly, every ride for those I don't. 

I visited my optician last week and the time has finally come for me to start wearing glasses for driving. As a result of this I figure it is probably a good idea to start thinking about prescription lenses for my cycling glasses too. Looking on the web, the prescription glasses that I'm seeing are basically "regular" cycling glasses (including regular lenses which may or may not be tinted), plus some kind of insert (clear prescription lenses) which seems to clip to the frame and sit between eye and frame. The "insert" appears to be shaped to the frame, so it looks like I'd need to buy both glasses and insert, and possibly throw my current glasses away. (I'd rather not do this, but if I have to, I have to.) I guess my first question, for anyone who already wears prescription glasses, is whether my description above is accurate or not? Second, does having this insert actually "work"? By "work", I mean being able to ride a bike at decent speed, for several hours, up hills, down dales etc. For example, do people experience fogging problems (moreso than you might with non-prescription glasses)? My next question is more general, a kind of a technology rec. Are there other viable approaches to prescription cycling glasses, that I should consider? For example is it possible to get prescription tinted plastic lenses that will just snap into a frame? (my gut feel is that I would prefer this approach if possible.) [Edit - I've now seen that this approach seems to be available, albeit at a premium (especially as I'd want lenses in at least two colours).] For the purposes of this question, it's fine to treat money as irrelevant, I can worry about this later. Please note lastly that I'm not looking for any advice in the general area of cycling glasses here, I've been using them for years and think I already understand the pros and cons pretty well. It is purely the prescription aspect of things, I'd like to know more about.
