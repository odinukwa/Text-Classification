Are there any regular phonetical correspondences between grammatical patterns of both dialects? Which one is thought to be the 'real' Armenian? When and how did the dialects split? Is Western Armenian an offspring of the Eastern dialect, or did the dialects appear during a synchronous process? 

Since Chinese characters consist of limited sets of strokes which are, in turn, united into different combinations, I think this type of writing would not require too extended a keyboard. In fact, the total number of basic strokes is 9. Instead, the character input could be done just by these signs, so neither a number of keys nor keyboard measurements would cause any difficulty. What would be a real pain is how to make the strokes appear accordingly in proper order and at proper places of a character, e.g. when we write â or ê in French layout, we first press ^ and then a corresponding vowel sign. The sequence is 'upper element => lower element', but there can be three or more vertical elements within a Chinese character, not mentioning the fact that there are vertical or falling strokes (elements). In short, imagine a keyboard with a touchpad-like place in the middle, which is a basic place for a character, with nine buttons for basic strokes on the right and four buttons directing the strokes. Or the other way round: left buttons for strokes, right buttons for directions. By pressing one of the eight zones at the character touchpad, we choose where to print a basic stroke selected, precisinng the direction of the stroke with the directional keys. The other problemme would be the stroke order, which is different not only in Japanese and Chinese, but in some varieties of Chinese as well. So, in fact, the Chinese invention would be even simpler. What really would be entirely different is the syntax of programming languages and programming logic (especially in object programming). Oh, and please remember my five per cent for the idea whenever selling it on the market:-) 

The reason is no doubt that, as in many other languages, the complementizer/conjunction introducing indirect speech comes from a neuter relative pronoun. The archaic/hypothetical construction was "I tell you that, that happened..." (meaning "I tell you that, which happened"), or "I tell you, what happened...". This neuter relative pronoun later acquired the characteristics of a conjunction, and the (hypothetical/potential) antecedent disappeared. Neuter relative pronoun / conjunction-complementizer / neuter demonstrative pronoun: 

This means that a declaration must describe a situation, or it couldn't have a truth value; and its being uttered must affect its truth value. (Note also that this is not necessarily black and white: different utterances may be more or less declarative in degrees; however, we normally only call an utterance a 'declaration' if it is a sufficient condition for itself to become true.) 

It could be from Proto-Indo-European "call, invoke", as the entity that is invoked; Or it could come from Proto-Indo-European "pour", as the entity to which libations are offered. 

How well does one need to know a language for you to say that one has "learned" it? There is a very wide range between "can buy bread at a supermarket" or "can read a comic book" on one hand, and "can successfully pose as a native speaker" or "can win literary prizes for writing novels in proper style" on the other. 

Since the one has an article, it seems fair to treat it like a (pro)noun, so it functions as a noun subject complement. For whom you are looking is as a whole a relative clause modifying the one, so I would make it one branch from the "predicate nominative" down, so the two branches would be the one and for whom you are looking. Then I would probably branch off whom (the relative pronoun) on the one hand and you are looking for [zero] on the other; but there is something to be said for doing for whom v. you are looking. The problem is that whom is both the object of the preposition for and the node that introduces the relative clause. This below website uses a "silent complementiser that" for my [zero], which seems contrived (the word that is not possible in that sentence), but do with it what you will. It seems clear that you need to add a node for this [zero], whatever you call it. Perhaps look into wh-movement for English. An example of how they parse relative clauses: 

According to R. Hickey ( Legacies of Colonial English. Studies in Transported Dialect.), the Nigerian English, as most other African Englishes, should be classified as a part of common meta-cluster merged together with South-Eastern Asian Englishes (pp. 510-522). On the other hand, if we pay closer attention to Kachru's Asian Englishes; Beyond the Canon( e. g. at p.14 of the 2005's copy) we can easily notice that the issue of classification for world Englishes is still open. 

Of course, the question is, which tribes are to be defined as 'Ancient Slavs'. In other words, into which depths of hystorical abyss we are to enter. The meaning would be more like 'honey-knower', not 'honey-eater', because the Southern form of this word was ведмедь (and ведмід in more archaic Ukranian) and therefore in speakers' minds the structuring went most likely as мёд + вед. Such a parsing is also confirmed by the Komi belives, whose language and culture preserved a lot from ancient Slavic times, seeing bears as spirits with a knowledge of wealth (the honey, alongside with furs, being one of the forms of ancient 'currency') and solar deities. We should also mind the Paleoasiatic bear cult, common for many ancient tribes, not just for Slavs. For Slavic languages, there are two options. First, we can use the бер as in берлога (a place for a bear to lay) and бирюк (more often used to describe a wolf, but we shall return to the mistaking wolves and bears for each other later), but that did not derive from the PIE root you have mentioned, or even less common and, in my opinion, rather disputable ком. Second, the Old Greek cognate is ἄρκτος (cf. the name of Arcas) which is related to Fenno-Ugric karhu, ohto and otso, as well as the Armenian [arjer] and Iranian cognates (Persian خرس [xarsh] and Kurdish hirç and hurç, Osetian арс [ars]). Judging by the Fenno-Ugric parallels and exceptions from the I.U.R.K. law for Slavic languages, and also by the Iranian cognates, we have the initial [x], the following sound between [a] and [o], the [r] from retroflexive [d] and a final [s] with a shwa or two. All these facts put together, we receive Х@р(ъ)съ [х@r(ъ)sъ] => Хърсъ [хъr(ъ)sъ] (cf. Ukrainian Khortytsa - remember the mistaking wolves for bears?) who was most likely a solar-bear deity than a loan from Persian theological system. 

According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, Spanish works about the New World in the 1500s wrote the word we spell in modern English as "hurricane" alternatively as "huracan" or "furacan". A spelling with an initial "f" has been preserved in many of the other Iberian languages: Portuguese, Galician, and Asturian, at least. Did this "f" in Portuguese "furacão" come from the Americas, or was it created in Iberia? According to Wikipedia, there is evidence of word-initial "f" being pronounced in Spanish as a glottal [h] as early as 863 A.D., but the word-initial [h] sound in words affected by this was still usually written as "f" until the 1500s. (Also around this time, /f/ was borrowed back into Spanish. It's unclear to me what this could mean about the earlier status of the sound [f] itself when not word-initial.) As far as I can tell, the Iberian languages that spell hurricane with an "f" today did not undergo the f → [h] sound changes of Castilian Spanish. This makes me unsure of how to understand words like "huracán", heard and written by Spanish explorers in the 1500s or earlier. It seems to me that there could have been possible confusions between word-initial [f] and [h] both in pronunciation and in spelling. Compare also Juracán, which Wikipedia says is a "phonetic name given by the Spanish colonizers" from an indigenous Taíno word. This would support an [h] sound, but unfortunately, the article on Juracán is poorly sourced. The Wikipedia article on the Taíno language says that the reconstructed phonemes of that language do not include an [f] sound. The Arawak language, in the same language family and still spoken today, does include a similar sound (bilabial [ɸ]). There's a similar word ("Hurakan" or "Jun Raqan"?) from the K'iche' (Quiché) Maya, whose language does not seem to have an [f]. Neither does the reconstructed Proto-Mayan language. Perhaps the local word was pronounced with something glottal, not an [f] sound, and spelling confusion or hypercorrection caused the birth of a different pronunciation in part of Iberia? Am I just getting my head spun around by not reading the right sources? Given what we know today, which of the following is most likely? 

So all criteria together are a fairly tight test; but it must be noted that the boundary between copulae and non-copulae is not without weak spots. There are bound to be dubious cases. Even so, this is a useful distinction in many situations. 

If mouse "device" had the plural mouses, and mouse "animal" had mice, would you say it was still polysemic? I think the answer has to be yes: the paradigm/inflexion is in the end not crucial. Mouse and mouse are still "the same word". So we cannot use that as a criterion to distinguish between true homonymy and polysemy. Another potential criterion could be, "is the meaning of one sense of the word close to that of the other sense?". But you can see how this is impracticable: polysemy can lead to wildly different senses, and homonymy can lead to similar senses, such as through folk etymology, where words converge because they are perceived as etymologically related. Then what should we use? I think the only criterion that can be rigorously applied to distinguish between the two kinds of same-sounding/written words is this: 

Is this a declaration? Does saying I apologise make the statement true? Can you say, he said "I apologise", but he did not in fact apologise? I think not, at least not in this context. You can apologise and not mean it, but that is different. It is also explicit because the whole utterance describes itself. 

Another good candidate is corps (OFr. cors); the nominative is not mentioned as such, but, the word being neuter in Latin, nominative and accusative were identical in form, so it would seem likely for that form to be used rather than some declined form. 

Many verbs do not get a suffix at all, especially but not exclusively with consonant stems, but the vowel in the stem will be lengthened compensatorily, and sometimes changed qualitatively:
