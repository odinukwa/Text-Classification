I would suggest an old trope, "hyperspace" or "subspace" as the venue for the actual travel at FTL. This is used in modern shows like "Dark Matter", their FTL is not in any kind of real space; so there is no kinetic energy in the real space. When they "drop out" of FTL, they are at a standstill. This inability to hit anything at FTL is pretty much a necessity anyway; otherwise you could hit stars, planets, asteroids, dust clouds, even gas clouds would have pretty much devastating impact force (incalculable, really, since we don't know how to account for relativistic effects at all). Stop thinking of FTL as operating in our current 3D space, and think of it more like wormhole tech that takes a ship to another plane or "dimension" that is a million times smaller than our space, and moves it slightly there: to the crew a 20 mph move for an hour is a light year. So your multiplication factor (or in Star Trek, the "warp" factor) is 293 billion x light speed. Call that a 'warp factor' of 2.93. But when the ship leaves that dimension, it is just traveling at 20 mph, a virtual standstill. On the straight line from where it began to where it ended, it makes no difference if it "traveled" through a star or supernova; it wasn't really in the universe at all. Inside that dimension, we have only figured out how to travel in the under 100 mph range; so warp factors up to about 15; but they require exponentially more energy, so if it isn't an emergency, they don't exceed warp factor 3. For more restrictions; limit the size of the field that can be formed to put something into this other dimension: We can't move anything larger than X at FTL, the bubble isn't big enough. So maybe a spherical ship a hundred yards in diameter, but nothing larger. You can also limit the mass of anything in that bubble; perhaps nothing more than that amount of water. (for a sphere of radius 150 feet, and water weighs 62.43 lbs per cubic foot, about 883 million pounds; or 441,292 tons). And you can limit the maneuverability: At FTL you cannot maneuver at all, you travel in a straight line until you punch the button to drop out. In fact, for your story purpose, you can require the field to be practically standing still relative to any major gravitational field in its vicinity; be it planets, moons, or a star; if the ship is moving then the gravity gradient is changing, and that prevents the FTL bubble from forming; and the reverse is true upon exiting hyperspace: Say you have to reverse the polarity of your FTL bubble, and that is impossible to do if the gravity gradient is changing too rapidly. It is impossible to enter hyperspace at a high rate of speed, and impossible to exit hyperspace and be traveling at a high rate of speed. 

I think it is fair to assume these insects are haptic; meaning they have some sense of touch in their environment. Then the solution can be a code, like humans have, developed along the lines of morse code. Long before they engaged in space travel they had to engage in long distance communications over greater than their typical travel distance. Morse code over wire is an easy choice for that; and although we used audible signals, they could have used haptic signals in the same way (as we would have done, if naturally deaf). long-touch, short-touch is just as easy to send and receive with a magnetic on/off switch as dot / dash. If they have a language, it is hard to imagine it does not have a "baby language" of a small set of words that could be numbered, and hard to imagine a race intelligent enough to become spacefaring would not stumble across binary encoding and an enumerated set of basic words, letters, or concepts. Like with humans; some of them must learn the code: It isn't natural to either of us. But also like humans, presumably some learn it so well they can Morse in their dreams and it becomes second nature, or a second language they speak like a native. So there is your communications system; it requires trained senders and receivers (which communicate with their clients through chemical processes, just as Morse senders heard/read a message to send, and Morse receivers spoke/wrote the messages received, i.e. they acted as Morse Translators). Like other comm systems, it would evolve from their very early industrial stage and a primitive code (like Morse) into whatever level of sophistication it required; perhaps even becoming automated and eliminating operators. But perhaps not: If the organs or body parts needed to manufacture the chemicals or convey them is was too complex to do with machinery, then even though the communication is electronic you could (for your story purposes) still always require both live senders and live receivers. In fact it could be a plot element, if your communications providers were killed in accident or battle: A working transmitter and receiver, but nobody trained to use it... 

Bigger problems: I don't think survival would be an issue for trained 7 year olds; other than injury from falls and some predation and illness (viruses, infections). To me the bigger problem is political organization; how they are supposed to cooperate. You will also have the problem, in about four years, of impending puberty and gender separation: In actual grade schools in the USA, fifth grade is the year (just before actual puberty for most) that girls and boys start separating themselves by gender; that boys start "showing off" and becoming aggressive and girls start whispering cliques. By sixth grade, gender issues are so rampant they routinely disrupt both classes and learning. So in year 5, how your (now 12 year old) children manage to deal with puberty, sexuality, the violence of competitiveness, rape, etc will be interesting to see (and hard to keep plausible and realistic). That is what could kill them by droves, indirectly. The solution for chimps and gorillas is a combination of fight and flight: Some young males are disabled or killed challenging an alpha male; other young males exile themselves (and sometimes get a young female to go with them), but there is a low chance of that resulting in a new tribe. In humans, the males will fight for mates (and the resources to attract a mate and support a family) and kill each other over it; in hunter-gatherer tribes, warfare between neighbors can be frequent and lethal, in fact the chances of being killed by another human can be far greater than the chances of being killed by the jungle! That's the big problem. For these kids, survival may depend on tribal socialism (our natural state) in which everybody contributes to the community stew pot, sharing the results of their hunt and gather, helping to build common shelters and fires, tool making, etc. When sexuality enters the scene, without any culture (taught and enforced by adults) to put restrictions on how to transform from a child into an adult sexualized person, a mother or father: That new twist (for them) could break up successful tribes into factions. The sharing stops, and the parts become less than the whole: They may all die out. I am also not so sure any of that could be taught to seven year olds before dropping them off, or if they would care, five years later. That would seem like a lifetime to them without any adult, and with no punishment or admonishment of anybody. 

Besides Legal issues across Districts, we also have the issues of mutual protection, police and emergency services. Obviously a coast guard should not be funded by individual coastal districts acting independently (even if there are no other countries to "guard" against, the coast guard can help fishermen and other seagoing vessels that get in trouble). But consider disaster relief efforts: If there is a disaster (earthquake, tornado, floods, bombs, train crashes or toxic spills, major disease outbreak), presumably it happens in one or more districts, and would likely cripple their own private disaster relief organization. A provincial disaster relief organization can be housed in many distributed districts, so they can respond to disasters in neighboring districts quickly with nearby units in unaffected districts, and depending on the level of disaster, get others on the road to the disaster site. I'd make a similar observation about Military structure; if your country needs defenses, well distributed military bases (at strategic points of probable attack) are better than centralized ones, and better than each District having its own little military. You could say that is a responsibility of central government, but it could be organized on provincial lines (like State Militias in early America, if we roughly equate "State" with "Province"). 

Invert your ladder; you need a single pole, as long as the ladder, crossed at regular intervals by support rungs. At the bottom build a wide triangle so it does not tip. What you want is support for the body of the snake, the pole to coil around, so it's hands and arms are free to fight, much like a human standing on a siege ladder (although humans tend to have just one arm free). The rungs are angled; for a snake any lubrication of the snake ladder should not make much difference (it would for a simple pole, but here lubrication will just cause the body to slip on the rungs closer to the central pole). The open sides give the snake freedom to uncoil, or to use multiple rungs at once. Like the human ladder, you want the distance between rungs to be about one fifth to one quarter of the body length. For a snake, perhaps a third of their body length, so they have room to wrap a few coils on a rung. 

+1 to AngelPray comment. OTOH, if as specified it is just a sped up version of the normal healing process; then things like amputation and other surgical changes will still work, the doctors just need to work more quickly. Or gender change may be even easier to get done because the surgeon can make part of a change; wait a few minutes for it to heal, then take another step with no worry about disturbing previous steps. Imagine building a house of cards with cards that very slowly "heal" together (like injuries). We could build much faster if they glued themselves quickly, like using super-glue. 

You are making the mistake of consider the Earth "stiff", when you should be treating it as about as fragile as foam. Any explosion strong enough to move the Earth from its orbit is likely to crack up the Earth into pieces; even the collision that we believe created the moon probably did not alter the orbit of Earth by much at all; while making the entire surface molten for many miles deep. On the other hand, I have seen mathematically correct plans for altering Earth's orbit; the idea is to take an asteroid about 1/2 of 1% of the Earth's mass (around half the mass of the Moon) and put it into a steered elliptical orbit around the Sun and Earth. There are points in this orbit furthest from the sun that, with very tiny course corrections (executable by rocket) can gradually pull Earth into a more distant orbit (or, if the orbit closes inside the orbit of the Earth, a tighter orbit). Over the course of few million years this could move the Earth into the orbit of Mars (although, simultaneously, we should probably move Mars too, to avoid a collision). The move would be so gradual that Earth would experience nothing but a high tide every few years (say what we'd currently consider a combined sun+moon high tide). So no damage to Earth, no relocation, no nuclear bombs (on the Earth), etc. And clearly technology, since we know it already, executable in any technological future (not a Mad Max future, but any scientific, space worthy future). In my opinion, however, using the asteroid belt (and whatever we need from Earth) to construct enough life ships to sustain the entire human population would be smarter and more efficient plan than trying to move the fragile Earth. There are only about 16 billion acres of habitable land on Earth, so perhaps 2 acres per person. Less than half of that is arable (farm worthy). Moving the entire earth means moving a cone, that ends in a two acre spread and is 4000 miles long (to the core of the planet) for every person on Earth! Surely a ship with an easily obtainable steel shell would be better: iron is plentiful in asteroids, heat is plentiful even from a dying sun, and carbon is plentiful, hence steel is plentiful. If this steel shell were even a mile thick, it would be 1 mile vs 4000 miles; but now you have something stiff, so many forms of propulsion can move it relatively fast without the acceleration damaging it or breaking it. A mile thick is undoubtedly overkill, but I am making the point the ship would undoubtedly be safer, faster, and more maneuverable than the planet. Moving the planet would be pure sentimentality, which would go out the window when survival is on the line. All we really care about is the outer shell of the planet, a few miles deep at most. Ships could contain all the necessary habitats; including a reproduction of the entire Serengeti, the Amazon and other rain forests, every habitable acre on the planet: And more than that if we so choose. Of course we don't have to build just one ship; we can build an Armada of hundred-million-acre ships (California is 101 million acres) (roughly a square, 400 miles per side), each with a nice blend of landscaping features. If we had the technology to actually move the planet, why be lazy? Chances are intelligent machines are doing 100% of the labor and we are just waiting for them to finish, so use that technological know-how to ditch Earth and build Paradise. 

I'm not certain violence can be avoided, not with humans. We have evolved emotions of anger, jealousy, greed and a desire for prestige. We are naturally competitive. These emotions and compulsions are evolutionarily selected and preserved because they are useful in attracting mates and ultimately producing offspring: Any of our ancestors with genes that caused them to never get angry (say a malformation of their amygdalae) were not successful enough at procreation to pass those genes down. Whether we like it on an intellectual level of considering fairness and equity, or not, taking things by violence works. Murdering your rivals works (just ask Putin). Threatening them with violence works. For hundreds of thousands of years, violent rape often resulted in procreation. (Modern medicine allows preemptive birth control, and abortion if rape results in pregnancy, but that is a recent development). No matter how you organize society, there will always be love triangles, jealousies over mates, money, jobs, possessions and house locations. Even if everybody had exactly the same homes and possessions by law: Alex still wants Betty for a mate and Betty wants to mate with Chuck and Chuck is happy to mate with Betty, but really wishes he had Diane, but Diane is very happy with her musician boyfriend Earl. Further, the more you control some parts of this equation, the less happy people will be, and that magnifies the consequences of even trivial difference. If you impose so much control that people hate the monotony and drudgery of their lives, they are much closer to saying "Fuck it, I am not going to be insulted anymore!" This is why you see people literally murder somebody over a game of billiards or over an insult in a dive bar: The murderer has a low paying subordinate job he hates, he lives in a crap apartment, and all he really owns is equality among a few friends in run down bar: When some asshole disrespects him and makes him look weak, they threaten to take away everything he has. So he goes to his 30 year old truck outside, gets the pistol from under the seat, comes back in and puts six bullets into that asshole. Because in his rage, the future if he does not is intolerable (and in his rage, his frontal cortex is sidelined so he is not thinking of any other consequences). I do not think you can eliminate individual violence without fundamentally changing the human mind. Jealousy and anger are natural phenomenon; so is resorting to force. Little kids do it, pushing each other out of the way and hitting. In extremes, like under the threat of losing everything, at least some people will be emotionally overwhelmed enough that the frontal cortex will be sidelined and they will engage in violence no matter what the consequences may be --- because they are incapable, in that moment, of considering consequences.
