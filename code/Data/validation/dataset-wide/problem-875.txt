Is Corona Mass Ejection able to reach the outer planets such as Jupiter and Saturn? If so can it blows away the icy rings or the distance is simply beyond the reach of maybe like Earth it is protected by a magnetic field? 

I know that virtual particles are constantly be created and annihilated even in a complete vacuum, I like to know if there exist such a mechanism to spawn an anti-particle black hole can be any size not necessary stellar? I think black hole lose mass by gradually throwing out one of the pair of virtual particles before they could cancel out each other, so would this also apply to an anti-particle black hole as well if it does exists? 

Is there any naturally occurring event powerful enough that can cause a galaxy regardless of shape and size to divide itself into two or more smaller galaxies? 

Almost all gas giants in our solar system are observed to have a planetary ring comprises of ice, dust and rocks. My question is do these rings obediently sticks around their foster parent until our starving Sun becomes red giant? Also why don't the ring forms into moon? 

China is pretty well integrated into modern astronomy -- there are regular international conferences held in China (the most recent General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union was held in Beijing in 2012), lots of Chinese astronomers at other international conferences, Chinese participation in international observatory projects (the Joint Institute for VLBI, the Thirty Meter Telescope, the Square Kilometer Array, etc.), and so forth. I'm not sure I'd say they have any really significant facilities yet (with the possible exception of LAMOST), but they have very ambitious plans, as you've noted. (ITAR has very little to do with astronomy except when it comes to a few things like nuclear physics codes produced by places like Los Alamos.) I don't know how much international participation is anticipated for the FAST project, though I gather the instrument development has some involvement from British and Australian institutes, so they'd likely get some time. Yes, results from the Changâ€™E-3 mission have been published in scientific papers, e.g. $URL$ There are several Chinese astronomy journals (e.g., Acta Astronomica Sinica; Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics), but like most "national" journals they aren't that important internationally. 

Hypothetical question: when a pair of identical stellar black holes are very close to one another wouldn't the side facing each other experience lower gravitational force? How is this logic un/sound? 

I read that Dragonfly44 is a galaxy mostly consists of dark matter, and it should contain a super massive black hole too. If there really is a dark SMBH, how does it lose mass? I think there is no way for dark matter to be converted into energy and vice versa, no? 

If primordial black hole do exists today could it be responsible for galaxies maybe even quasars, I mean these ancient monsters gobble up all materials in its wake and grow bigger and eventually evolves into say milky way galaxy etc. What are the odds of such events actually happened? 

Say hypothetically an UMBH with 50 billion solar masses (supposedly upper limit) is beginning to merge with another (Super)MBH similar to Sagittarius A* that sits at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, what would happen next in this clash of the titans? 

By measuring the spectrum of energies for different types of neutrinos and their time evolution, you could probably get a very good idea of how far along the star was, particularly as we can probably assume your characters have much better models for stellar evolution than we currently do. (They'd also want to get accurate measurements of the star's mass, rotation rate, maybe internal structure via astroseismology, etc., in order to fine-tune the stellar-evolution model; these are all things they could do pretty easily.) The core collapse itself would be signalled by the enormous increase in neutrino flux. This "What If" article by Randall Munroe estimates that the neutrino flux from a core-collapse supernova would be lethal to a human being at a distance of around 2 AU. Which, as he points out, could actually be inside of a supergiant star, so your characters would probably be a bit further away than that. But it does show that the neutrino flux would be easily detectable, and that your characters might well get radiation poisoning from it if they were closer than 10 AU. (Of course, you'd want to detect it more directly than just waiting around till you started to feel sick, since that might take longer than the shock wave takes to reach the surface of the star.) This is just to bring home the fact that they wouldn't have any problem detecting the neutrinos.... 

Not all galaxies are spiral in shape[1][2], some nebulae are huge[3] and nebula are the nursery of stars[4]. How to tell them apart? Note I have already compare the contents for galaxy and a nebula, they are very similar as both have stars, planets and dusts. 

An annular eclipse is similar to total eclipse except our Moon "apparently" appears smaller than the Sun, my question is since in both cases there will be a glowing ring forming... so how to tell them apart? 

I am wondering since neutron star is smaller than the average main-sequence stars and it doesn't produce energy via fusion so why do we still call it a star? 

Just because we observed that our milky way galaxy is spinning in a certain direction therefore we assume it is applicable to all other galaxies, I am curious to find out if hypothetically most of the celestial objects such as natural satellites, planets, stars even galaxies within our observable universe are spinning/rotating in the same direction as the milky way what kind of implications can we say about the condition in the early universe? or is it just an coincident? 

The main factor is the velocity of the encounter. The higher the relative velocity between the two galaxies, the easier it is for them to pass through each other without being slowed down enough for a proper merger to take place, and without being strongly distorted by the encounter. (In a very high speed encounter, the two galaxies will spend almost no time close enough for tidal forces to be effective.) In clusters of galaxies, where the typical velocities are around 1000 km/s, mergers are rare; in small groups, where the velocities are around 100 km/s, mergers are more common. So the Milky Way and Andromeda are pretty much destined to merge. During a merger it's possible for stars in the outer parts of the galaxies to be ejected by tidal forces, but the central regions of both galaxies should definitely merge. Thus, the supermassive black holes (one in each central region of the original galaxies) will end up in the center, too. (Unless you have something exotic like a merger where one of the galaxies already has an unmarked binary SMBH; then you might get one of the three SMBHs ejected via a 3-body interaction. But I suspect that's pretty unlikely.) 

I read that after LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected gravitational waves signal from a kilonova, many ground based telescopes quickly turns their mirrors towards the spot and "sees" gold and platinum ,etc other heavy elements over the next few days. Is it really possible to directly observe heavy elements being formed consider that the event occurs at a distance of around 130 millions light year away? 

I was reading about gigantic storms on giant gas planets, the great red spot on Jupiter and hexagon on Saturn to name a few, how about our Sun which is consist of plasma(hot gas which have some of their electrons stripped) why don't we see any big hurricane? 

Suppose in a binary stars system there is a dying star and a companion black hole as they orbit around each other. My question is what will possibly happen to the black hole if the partner goes supernova? I understand that the kinetic energy from the supernova cannot destroy the black hole. 

(I think the practical answer to your "how many instruments" is two, though I haven't seen an explicit statement to that effect. This page includes specific limitations for individual instruments -- e.g., which ones can be used in Pure Parallel mode and with what other instruments.) 

The Galactic coordinate system was established back in the 1950s, before most people had any idea there was a bar in the Galaxy. And, as James K pointed out, it's a 2D coordinate system for describing the positions of things as seen from the Earth. You can describe the positions on the sky (2D coordinates) of just about everything, so you can give them reasonably accurate Galactic coordinates; we only know the distances to a few things, so trying to come up with with 3D positions is difficult at best, and impossible for lots of things. To make things worse, the orientation of the bar is still a bit uncertain; different studies still disagree on its position angle at the level of 5 to 10 degrees (occasionally more). So while you could argue that a bar-relative 3D coordinate system might make sense for a galaxy-spanning civilization, it's way too early to try using something like that for contemporary astronomy. 

Andromeda Galaxy is the largest galaxy in the galaxy cluster[1] called Local Group[2] and our Milky Way Galaxy as well as some satellite/dwarf galaxies are orbiting around each other within Local Group. My question isn't Milky Way Galaxy supposed to orbit around Andromeda Galaxy[3] so how come the predicted merger[4]? Whose slowing down or do the gravity work differently as things are being scaled further up? 

Just curious I like to know if one fine day our Sun turns into a white dwarf at the later stage of its life, would the magnetic bubble, heliosphere gets thinner and eventually disappear? also at this moment is it changing in size? 

The materials inside a neutron star are densely packed (extremely close to each other) and as time goes by say about an eon later, most of the neutrons would eventually tunnel into each other and voila! the neutron star becomes black hole? sound suspicious to me but can it happen?
