In fact, more is true. If $f_j$ are linearly independent and $F_i$ are linearly independent, and $$\sum_{j=1}^n|f_j|^2=\sum_{i=1}^m|F_i|^2,$$ then $m=n$ and $F_i$ are obtained from $g_i$ by a unitary transformation. See, for example, $URL$ section 3. This is called the "Calabi rigidity". 

That the Gabrielov, Gelfand Losik paper is "well-known" you can see from Mathscinet citation records. This journal is translated into English. Here are some other papers: MR1129313, MR0410758. 

EDIT: 4. One more remark: the distribution is symmetric in the unit circle because the distribution of coefficients is invariant with respect to reversing: $(a_0,...a_d)\mapsto (a_d,...,a_0)$. 

Such maps are conformal. A theorem of Liouville says that if $n\geq 3$, the only conformal maps (defined in some region in $R^n$) are Mobius. A Mobius map is a composition of inversions in spheres. For example $x\mapsto x/|x^2|$ is the inversion in the unit sphere. Inversions in all spheres generate the Mobius group. Derivative of a conformal map is a constant times orthogonal. So if you require it to be orthogonal, you obtain only affine maps. Liouville's theorem does not hold in dimension $2$. Conformal maps in dimension $2$ are complex analytic function whose derivative is not equal to zero. Your condition implies that the complex derivative has constant absolute value, so it is constant, and again you obtain an affine map. Usually they include orientation-reversing maps to the Mobius group, so conformal maps can be preserving or reversing orientation. EDIT. Of course Liouville proved his theorem for sufficiently smooth functions, and the proof is essentially the same as in the answer of David Speyer. However this theorem holds under much les restrictive assumptions (for some maps differentiable almost everywhere), and this is one of the subjects discussed in the book of Reshetnyak, Stability theorems in geometry and Analysis. 

Fourier transform has been generalized far beyond $L^1$ and $L^2$. The most useful generalization (Schwartz tempered distributions) is explained in L. Schwartz, Mathematics for the physical sciences. Hermann, Paris; Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Reading, Mass.-London-Don Mills, Ont. 1966. This is enough for your purpose. For further generalizations the excellent source is a series of books I. M. Gelfand (with various co-authors) Generalized functions, volumes 1-5 (mutiple editions). 

Suppose you maintain a pond with fish (for profit, of course, this is economics!). When the food is abundant and there are not many fish, the population grows at a constant rate $k>1$ (reproduction rate minus death rate), so we have $y'=ky$. This is separable. Solve it. Give a numerical example. Conclude from the example that our assumptions are not realistic. So what is wrong with our assumtions? Abundant food!!! (Of course. This is economics after all:-) The next simple assumption is that the pond can support only some maximal population, say $A$. Which means that when the population approaches $A$ the death rate increases (starvation), so the net growth rate is not just $k$ but $k(1-y/A)$. When $y$ is small, (or $A$ is very large) we have almost $y'=ky$ as before. When $y$ is close to $A$, the net rate of change approaches $0$, as it should be. We obtain $y'=ky(1-y/A)$, another separable equation! But this pond brings you no profit yet. To make a profit, you have to catch some fish, say at a constant rate. You obtain another separable equation $y'=ky(1-y/A)-c$. Discuss what happens for various values of parameters $k,A,c$. And so on:-) You can go further and further with this model when time permits. Suppose that instead of harvesting a fixed amount $c$, you gauge the population somehow, and harvest $cy$, a fixed proportion of the population. This leads to another separable equation, as well as to a useful discussion, which strategy is better, $c$ or $cy$ in terms of long term profits and in terns the pond sustainability. Then, if time permits, you can pass to two functions and systems of equations. The classical example is Volterra-Lottka system, which involves a slightly more complicated ODE, but it is also separable. And its original motivation was also economics: the influence of World War I on the population of sardines in the Mediterranean (an important economic resource for surrounding countries). 

Yes, these are all entire solutions. This follows from a general theorem which says that linear combinations of exponential solutions of such equations (linear homogeneous with constant coefficients) are dense in the set of all solutions, see, for example Gelfond, Calculus of finite differences, Chap V, sect. 7.

These values are called "centers of the hyperbolic components", and there is a combinatorial algorithm which determines for each $n$ how many of them are real. They did not study statistics but it is unlikely that a majority of them are real. Anyway, the algorithm ("Hubbard trees") permits in principle to reduce this question to combinatorics and number theory. The algorithm encodes all solutions $c$ by certain trees embedded in the plane, and the question is equivalent to counting trees with certain symmetry property. EDIT. On my request, Gena Levin wrote the following: 

Any length preserving map from one plane domain to another must be also conformal. Because the angle of a small triangle can be found if you know the sides. This observation solves all your questions, because if a conformal map is also length preserving, than the derivative must have constant absolute value one, thus it is of the form $z\mapsto \lambda z+c$ where $|\lambda|=1$, so it is a "roto-translation". 

As I said in the remark there is no book comparable to the Russian edition of Hurwitz-Courant (Evgrafov was the editor of the Russian translation who improved the original very much). There are 2 comprehensive Russian books covering much of geometric theory; both exist in English translation: Markushevich and Goluzin. Another book which covers a lot of geometric theory is Caratheodory (2 vols). None of these has the theory of compact Riemann surfaces, but Shabat (which you like) also does not have it. I would say that Markushevich is a good replacement of Shabat. Goluzin can serve as a source of graduate courses. Exposition of compact Riemann surfaces in Courant is unique, on my opinion. 

Ordinary generalized eigenvector has nothing to do with the problem. Ordinary characteristic polynomial of the matrix $\Delta(0)$ is $\det(\lambda I-\Delta(0))=(\lambda+1)^3-1$ has simple root at $0$, and no generalized eigenvector. To solve your equation, you proceed as follows. 

In the case of surfaces, the necessary and sufficient condition is the absence of asymptotic values. A curve in $\gamma:[0,1)\to X$ is called an asymptotic curve if the limit $\gamma(t)$ as $t\to\infty$ is $\infty$ (the infinite point of one point compactification of $X$), but $f(\gamma(t))$ has a limit in $Y$ as $t\to 1$. This limit is called an asymptotic value. A covering is a local homeomorphism that has no asymptotic values. The only references for this that I know are for surfaces, but this should not be hard to prove in general under appropriate conditions. Probably $X$ and $Y$ have to be locally connected, in addition to what you said about them. EDIT. Here is a proof. We assume that $Y$ is connected, and that every point $y\in Y$ has a path connected simply connected base of neighborhoods. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a local homeomorphism. A path in a space is a continous map from $[a,b]$ or from $[a,b)$ to this space. We say that the path begins at $\gamma(a)$. Let $\gamma:[a,b]\to Y$ be a path. A lifting of $\gamma$ is a path $\Gamma:[a,b]\to X$ such that $\gamma=f\circ\Gamma$. If $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ are two liftings of the same path, and $\Gamma_1(a)=\Gamma_2(a)$ then $\Gamma_1=\Gamma_2$. (This is because $f$ is a local homeomorphism). Let $x_0\in X$ be an arbitrary point and $y_0=f(x_0)$. Assuming that $f$ is a local homeomorphism without asymptotic values, we prove that every path beginning at $y_0$ has a lifting beginning at $x_0$. Let $\gamma$ be a path parametrized by $[a,b]$, beginning at $y_0$. Let $$c=\sup\{ p>0:\gamma\vert_{[a,p]}\;\mbox{has a lifting beginning at}\; x_0\}.$$ As $f$ is a local homeomorphism, we conclude that $c>a$. If $c=b$, the statement is proved. So assume that $c\in(a,b)$. Then, because of the uniqueness of lifting, a semi-open path $\gamma\vert_{[a,c)}$ has a lifting $\Gamma$. I claim that $\Gamma(t)\to\infty$ as $t\to c$. Indeed, let $x_1\in X$ be a limit point of this path. Let $U$ be a neighborhood of $x_1$ where $f$ is a homeomorphism. Then $V=f(U)$ is a neighborhood of $\gamma(c)$, and we can extend our lifting by putting $\Gamma(t)=\phi(\gamma(t))$, for $t$ in a neighborhood of $c$, where $\phi$ is the inverse to the homeomorphism $f\vert_U$. This extends our lifting slightly beyond $c$, so we obtain a contradiction. Thus $\Gamma(t)\to\infty$ as $t\to c$. Then $\Gamma\vert_{[a,c)}$ is an asymptotic curve and $\gamma(c)$ is an asymptotic value. Again a contradiction. Thus every path in $Y$ has a unique lifting, and this implies that $f$ is a covering. 

Desargues theorem. Suppose you have two triangles $(A,B,C), (A',B',C')$ in the plane such that the lines $AA'$, $BB',\; CC'$ intersect at one point. Then the three points of intersection $AB\cap A'B'$, $BC\cap B'C'$ and $CA\cap C'A'$ lie on one line. And conversely. Proof. Lift the vertices $A$ and $A'$ from the plane to the three space. So that triangles do not lie in the same plane now. The statement becomes almost evident. Then obtain the plane theorem by passing to the limit. In some sense, there is no other proof: if you want to axiomatise projective geometry in the plane, you have to take this as an axiom. 

Teaching/research job in any University (in a research oriented department or teaching-oriented department) DOES NOT require a lot of travel. Invitations to conferences or seminar talks come indeed but this does not mean you have to go, if you don't want to. Traveling to two conferences per year (usually one week or less) and/or 1-2 seminar talks per year (for one day) will be sufficient. Even if you do not travel at all, this is not going to hurt seriously your research career. People travel a lot because they like to travel:-) 

This question is very nicely discussed in the paper of Ruelle, Ruelle, David(F-IHES) Is our mathematics natural? The case of equilibrium statistical mechanics. Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 19 (1988), no. 1, 259–268. But he does not really have an answer, and perhaps nobody has an exact answer. My own opinion is that a large part of mathematics (some say all of it, but I disagree) actually comes from physics. If this is so, it is not surprising that physics helps in discovering new theorems. And there is nothing unreasonable in this. Using Ruelle's example, if we ever discover an extraterrestrial civilization, its mathematics (most of it) must be equivalent to a large part of our mathematics. I am convinced that this is so. Most of mathematics is somehow determined by the laws of nature, that is by physics. A completely different explanation (with which I cannot completely agree) is that some physicists are just very clever people, and once they start thinking of mathematics, they discover new things, and when they (physicists) publish these things everyone says that these results "came from physics". I agree that this happens sometimes, but on my opinion this is a small part of the picture. I don't want to give examples (I am sure, many will be given), but I just want to make the point that this phenomenon ("unreasonable" effectiveness of physics in mathematics) occurs from the very beginning of mathematics (and physics). I mean the remarkable surviving work of Archimedes, A method of mechanical theorems, where he uses physical reasoning to prove or guess purely mathematical theorems. This example can be used to defend any of the two above explanations:-) 

The answer to this question is contained in the famous theorem of Beurling and Malliavin. It is usually stated with decrease on the real axis (rather than imaginary axis as in your question, but you make the change $z\mapsto iz$ to obtain what you need). First of all, the growth restriction is $$\log|f(z)|\leq (\alpha+o(1))|z|$$ this is weaker than your growth restriction. This is called "exponential type $\alpha$". Then suppose that $|f|$ is bounded on the real axis (or belongs to $L^2$, this can be relaxed). Then it is not difficult to see that $$\int_R\frac{|\log|f(x)||}{1+x^2}dx<\infty.$$ This gives the maximal rate of decrease of $|f|$ on the real axis. Under some additional conditions, this rate is best possible. Beurling and Malliavin give two such conditions. Let $w(x)\geq 1$ be a weight function satisfying $$\int_R\frac{\log w(x)}{1+x^2}dx<\infty.$$ This is called the "logarithmic integral". Then there exists an entire function $f$ of (arbitrarily small) exponential type $\alpha$ such that $fw$ is bounded on the real line, if $w$ satisfies any of the following additional regularity conditions: a) $\log w$ is uniformly continuous, or b) $w$ is itself a function of (some) exponential type. This theorem is difficult. But there is a much simpler result due to Wiener and Paley: it is sufficient that $w$ is even and increasing on the positive ray, and the logarithmic integral is convergent. And of course it is not a problem to construct such function decreasing as $|x|^{-n}$ for every $n$: just divide out as many zeros of $\cos$ as you need.

This is a standard exercise on residue theory. If $f$ is a rational function with zero of order $\geq 2$ at infinity and no poles at integers, then $$\sum_{-\infty}^\infty f(n)=-\sum{\mathrm{res}}_af(z)\pi\cot\pi z,$$ where the summation is over all poles of $f$. For $f(z)=1/(1+z^2)$ we obtain $$\sum_0^\infty\frac{1}{1+n^2}=1+\sum_{1}^\infty\frac{1}{1+n^2}=(\pi\coth\pi+1)/2,$$ so you copied the result from Wolfram incorrectly. 

These were first proved by Laguerre himself (They are called sometimes Laguerre's inequalities). The LP class can be characterized as the closure of real polynomials with real zeros, so it is enough to prove the inequalities for real polynomials whose all zeros are real, and this is sort of elementary. First notice that $\gamma_k=\psi^{(k)}(0)$ and the inequalities follow from more general inequalities $$(\psi^{(k)})^2(x)-\psi^{(k-1)}(x)\psi^{(k+1)}(x)\geq 0.$$ As the class of polynomials with all zeros real is closed under differentiation, it is enough to prove this for $k=1$. As the class is also closed with respect to real shifts, what remains to prove is your inequality (at $x=0$) with $k=1$ for polynomials with all zeros real. Wlog $\psi(0)=1$, so $$\psi(x)=\prod\left(1+x/x_k\right),$$ $x_k$ are real, so $$\psi'(0)=\sum\frac{1}{x_k},\quad \psi''(0)=\sum\frac{1}{x_ix_j}$$ and our inequality becomes trivial. 

The answer is no. Consider the probem $$x+y\to\max,$$ $$x\geq 0,\; y\geq 0,$$ $$x+y\leq 1.$$ It has infinitely many solutions. One of them is $(0,1)$. Now change the last inequality to $$x+(1+\epsilon)y=1.$$ The new problem has a unique solution $(1,0)$ which is not close to the solution of the first one. One can also construct a counterexample with unique solution of the original problem: Consider this $x\to\max$, under the restrictions $x\geq 0,\; y\geq 0$, $1\leq x+y\leq 1.$ The unique solution is $(1,0)$. Now you can perturb a little the last restriction, and you obtain a unique solution $(0,1)$.
