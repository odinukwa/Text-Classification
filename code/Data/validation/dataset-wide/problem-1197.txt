Complete data present in data file, no free space would be included into the backup A small amount of transaction log to bring database to a consistent state when this backup is restored. 

My guess is since you have remamants of failed installation still present in your system that is why you cannot install the new instance. This can be fixed by deleting few registry keys related to SQL server. Follow below method , this method was given by Microsoft forum team and is recommended way to remove have helped me and forum users many time . If you have multiple instances below suggesstion would not work so dont use it. First please refer to below Microsoft support link for what actions to follow before removing SQL Server instance. Its is for 2008 r2 but would be applicable to 2012 as well. $URL$ If still you face problem you might as well try below suggesstion which involves removing registry entries. Note: Removing necessary registry entries might cause inconsistency so backup registry before doing changes. •1. Uninstall the existing SQL Server and all the components from the add remove program. •2. Backup the registry . Please read in details the MS link before proceeding. •3. Delete the following keys using regedit: ◦--HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server ◦--HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer •4. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall and delete all the sub-keys referencing SQL Server. •5. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services and delete all the keys referencing SQL Server. •6. Rename all the SQL Server folders in the computer. •7. Reboot the machine. If you dont find this useful or have confusion dont proceed. Open a case with Microsoft and allow them to have a look at your system. with my experience with many failed installation registry keys are left in corrupted state and only solution would be to remove them.But you need expert to fiddle with registry PS: Above method was suggested in SQL server forum and works well. Of course if you can please revert it would be helpful 

There is one more answer which could be helpful in this case so adding it. Did you tried taking backup of database with continue_after_error Query would be something like 

of SQL Server. Fast recovery which is feature could bring database online after second phase(redo) of recovery Amount of transaction log SQL Server has to rollforward and rollback to bring database online in consistent state. Because database would go through crash recovery this would always be the one influencing the time most. If database takes lot of time to recover due to large amount of uncommitted transactions gettign rolled back it would definitely increase your time. The hardware strength and network capabilities supporting the cluster. Some of this is documented here. 

It would be better to rebuild the cluster from scratch in other domain. In windows server 2016 you can have cluster nodes in 2 different domain 

If percentage is > 60 you can keep that index If percentage is between 50 and 60 you yourself need to figure out whether this index is helpful or not. If it is less than 50 the index is causing more of I/O utilization in updates than it is helping in making query faster. If it is around 20-30% you can first disabled and then removed. 

A simple and complete solution to error ' Could not find database engine startup handle' in below link Reason for the error can be 1.The account which user selected on Server Configuration page window ( during installation) is somehow not able to bring SQL Server database engine services online. Either is lacks privilege or it is corrupted. During installation of database engine services SQL Server tries to bring online database services as a internal process but due to startup account either corrupt or not having appropriate privileges it fails to do so and ultimately installation fails. 2.Other reason is when installation fails first time due to some reason and user uninstall failed installation from add remove program, the un-installation leaves account in broken state so any further attempt to install flashes this error message Solution can be. Uninstall SQL server completely from Add remove program Launch setup by right click on it and select run as administrator. After launching the setup and providing necessary details you would reach to Server Configuration page . When you reach this page please select startup account for Database Engine services as NT Authority\SYSTEM which is also called as Local System account.

Min Server memory is minimum amount of memory available to the SQL Server Memory Manager for an instance of SQL Server. This comes into active picture when windows is facing memory pressure in such case it will raise Low Memry Notification Flag. SQLOS will respond to it, it would ask SQL Server to trim its memory consumption and free its cache then SQL Server will non preemptively trim down till its min server memory value. If pressure is too high SQL Server might not be able to react fast and then SQL Server process would be paged out. Remember min server memory does not say that when SQL Server starts it would minimum take this much memory if not required, SQL Server will start up consuming much less than min server memory. Other use of Min server memory is if you do not want SQL Server to be paged out to disk because of some misbehaving OS/Third party driver. You set max server and min server memory to almost same value and give SQL Server service account Locked pages in memory privilege and in this case even if OS faces memory crunch SQL Server would max trim down to min server and if OS memory crunch is still there OS process would be paged out and would become extremely slow . But this is bad thing to do and I would not recommend 

Connect to the Database Engine of either mirroring partner. From the Standard bar, click New Query. Issue the following Transact-SQL statement: 

To track login failure reason SQL Server Profiler would be a good option. One can also use extended events trace to capture login failed events and reason behind the failure. You need to first launch SQL Server Profiler.Create a new template or you can use existing one if you have already. Please include below when creating the trace 

While Brent Ozar has already given you explanation about how transaction log file looks like I will focus on your certain questions 

If you are running on standard edition there is not much way around and you would have to believe that mirroring is doing its task. Instead of worrying whether data is being sent on mirror or not or whether changes are reflecting you must monitor SEND queue and REDO queue using GUI In this case. The size of the SEND queue shows how much transaction log has been generated on the principal server, but hasn’t yet been sent to the mirror server. If it’s not zero, it means the mirroring state isn’t synchronized. Furthermore, the size of the SEND queue indicates the amount of data loss that will occur if the principal database suffers a disaster. If you find the REDO queue size growing, this implies the mirror server can’t keep up with the amount of log being sent from the principal server. It could be there’s additional workload on the mirror server that’s preventing the mirror database log from replaying as fast as possible. It may also be the physical hardware on the mirror server isn’t as capable as that on the principal server. The REDO queue size shows how much transaction log exists in the mirror database that hasn’t yet been replayed on the mirror database. These two will help you know how much behind principal is from mirror server. Read this Alternatively you can failover principal to mirror but make sure before failover that mirror is fully synchronized with principal to avoid any data loss.(if possible or when you have maintenance window) to check the status of mirror server. IMO failover is best way here to determine and prove that changes are actually getting reflected if you need to show for some audit purpose with screenshots. 

No, it's not written it is a it says it's and I am sure MS books online cannot write it as good, this is because of fact that environment varies and what is good for one environment might not suit other. Its mostly good to have restriction on something which is heavily consumed although managed efficiently. I consider a good practice to define max server memory on system because it will restrict buffer pool and will tell SQL Server how much max a buffer pool can grow although SQL Server can consume memory outside buffer pool/max server memory setting if it heavily uses Third party DLL's extended stored procs and Linked servers. Page file is used by Windows to hold temporary data which is swapped in and out of physical memory in order to provide a larger virtual memory set. Page file largely depends on how much memory OS is committing and changes accordingly as per min and max value set. if you want to monitor page file you must rely on perfmon counters. Please read this MSDN Blog Memory: Committed Bytes --Number of bytes of virtual memory that has been committed. This does not necessarily represent page file usage - it represents the amount of page file space that would be used if the process was completely made nonresident Memory: Commit Limit-- Number of bytes of virtual memory that can be committed without having to extend the paging files. Paging File: % Usage-- Percentage of the paging file committed Paging File: % Usage Peak-- Highest percentage of the paging file committed 

Your code requires little tweaking. Where you are doing you just need to do . The changed code is below. Please note that ring buffer capacity is limited so it would not store information for complete day it would have information about specific time. 

You must also check if there is any job running daily which is shrinking data file or may be shrinking whole database using command or may be using command. Of course this could only be complete answer if you confirm whether any such activity is going on in database. 

When a secondary database is removed, it is no longer joined to the availability group and all information about the removed secondary database is discarded by the availability group. The removed secondary database is placed in the RESTORING state. 

I got below definition from Bob Dorr about what Max server memory in SQL Server 2012 controls. You can also read Books Online for more details 

Thank you for posting detailed logs As far as I can read logs and with my experience with SQL Server installation the error here is because your account does not have necessary rights to perform some registry actions. My first question would be did you made sure you are installing SQL Server with administrator account. Even if account is domain admin make sure you add that account as local administrator on windows machine on which you are installing SQL Server. Alwaysright click on setup file and select run as administrator. Before proceeding for re-installation again please read THIS SUPPORT ARTICLE. make sure you meet all requirements as described in the support article Reason Below is some extract from details.txt file you posted 

Now considering you have very large table so temporary table was also large and Tempdb was not able to accommodate it and hence it became full. 

If you use analysis services backup Analysis Service configuration files, databases and repositories. Backup files present at location C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSAS11.\OLAP\Data\ C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSAS11.\OLAP\Config\ directory. Make sure enough space is available on drive where resource/system databases are present. Resource database [This link is external to TechNet Wiki. It will open in a new window.] is utilized during service pack upgrade. The Resource database makes upgrading to a new version of SQL Server an easier and faster procedure. In earlier versions of SQL Server, upgrading required dropping and creating system objects. Because the Resource database file contains all system objects, an upgrade is now accomplished simply by copying the single Resource database file to the local server. Service pack upgrade would require a downtime of application. Make sure application does not access database during service pack upgrade. Make sure you stop all jobs and activities on database before proceeding. you don't need to shutdown database services to apply service pack. Make sure you are administrator on the system and always run the service pack executable with administrator privileges. 

Shrinking of log file is as bad as shrinking of data file. The reason is, when you log file grows again after shrinking and autogrowth event is triggered which forces the process to stop until space is made available via autogrowth event. So now think this autogrowth happening frequently on large OLTP databases you can see how many a times a process would have to wait for autogrowth to complete. The best way is to presize the log file. Please refer Autogrowth article from Simple Talk. This will help you in presizing the log file and setting appropriate autogrowth value. Both are equally important. If space is really a problem and you anyhow need it now and have no option you my shrink the log file but DON'T make it a habit. Find out process which forced it to grow more than expected and size your log file accordingly. Some blogs for reading Steps for better transaction log throughput Transaction Log VLF too many too few
