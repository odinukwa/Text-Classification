You are carefully describing the position of the ball in the moment of your attack hit and in the moment of the defensive contact. However, it is not important. The decisive criterion in this case is not the point of contact with the ball, but the position of the blocker’s body. If any part of the blocker’s body (usually but not necessarily hands) is higher than the top of the net, it is considered a block. See Rule 14.1.1 Blocking (emphasis mine): 

These are perfect examples of cases where touching the net is not a fault. The current net-touch rules are constructed so that almost no inadvertent net touches are faults. Simplifying it a bit, touching the net is a fault only when 

I don't know why NBA stats shows Russell Westbrook assist percentage as 58.8 because basketball-reference stats for the same game shows 72.5. From basketball-reference, stats for Russell Westbrook and team for that match, MP=37, AST=10, FG=17, Team FG=40, Team MP= 240 NBA stats shows Team MP as 48 which is obtained after dividing 240 by 5 i.e, (Team Mp / 5). Using these stats we can get assist percentage around 72.5. For your calculation, if you use 48 for (Team MP / 5) and 37 for MP (Russel played 36 min 57 sec) you will get almost same data as basketball reference. 

But he cannot continue playing so, and definitely cannot “assume the risk of injury”. Note that there is an offense of playing “in a dangerous manner” which includes possible injury to the player himself, and which is penalized by an indirect free kick. (But that is purely theoretical, I believe; normally, should the player attempt playing barefoot, the referee would instruct him to correct his equipment.) 

First of all, it’s far from “any touch of the net is a fault”. The actual rule (11.3.1) is that “Contact with the net by a player between the antennae, during the action of playing the ball, is a fault.” (emphasis mine). The next paragraph explains the action of playing the ball includes take-off, hit (or attempt), and landing. That includes touches by the attacking player, the player blocking him, etc., but it excludes e.g. a blocker on the opposite side of the net who was confused by a fake attack. Even though he wanted to block the ball, his contact was not a fault, as he was actually not near the ball, so he was not in the action of playing it. Also, it excludes touches made when not playing the ball at all. For instance, if a blocker lands and then turns, touching the net with his shoulder, it is not a fault, the touch has not occurred during the action of playing the ball. However, if a player interferes with the play, even outside the action of playing the ball, that is a fault. (For instance, a player tripping and then using the net for support.) As for the specific question you ask: if the ball flies into the net causing it to hit a stationary player on the opposite side, it is not a fault. However, if the player has deliberately moved his hands close to the net to alter the rebound of the ball (preventing the opponent from recovering the ball from the net in case of remaining team hits), I believe this could be called a net fault. (It would definitely be a net fault in beach volleyball.)

As gdrt answer clearly answer hypothetical case of attacker in an offside position and obstructing the goalkeeper's line of vision. But the referee interpretation play a big role in determining whether that's the case of offside or not. And it is not sure that if a defender on the far side of the pitch was absent it would have been offside. From this article: 

No, raider will not be out and points will be given to raiding team in this case (when defenders enters the opponent team's court). From General rules of play in Pro Kabaddi: 

I am not 100% sure on this but I think you are allowed to use your body to block the opponent from getting to the ball, likewise you your arm to avoid running to on another. But I don't think holding the player away by pushing him will be missed as a foul. Next time you watch a game on TV check how defenders react to the situation when a long ball is kicked towards them. The attacker would typically try to control the ball by getting it on the chest or nod the ball to a teammate. If the defender holds his arm out without pushing the opponent he: a) risks a fracture in the outstretched arm, and b) he's not effectively keeping the opponent away since there is more space around the arm (the opponent may just take a step to right or left and still be close to the ball). 

But if the back-row setter touches the ball within his own playing area (or, theoretically, above the free zone, if the ball is overflying the net partially or completely outside the antennae), and plays it “backwards” into his own half of the court or parallel to the net or his teammate touches the ball prior to the ball crossing the net completely and prior to any blocking opponent touching the ball, it is valid play. Relevant rules (see FIVB Official Volleyball Rules 2015-2016): 

Jelavić did not obstruct anyone’s line of vision or movements, and he definitely did not deceive/distract the opponent, since the Irish defense probably did not see him at all. Which leaves us with the last option debated above. None of the three points was fulfilled, therefore, no offside. 

Tottenham Manager Pochettino, in his interview accurately put what the difference is in the two roles1, 2, 3. 

This is the longest streak of consecutive goals by one player in Wild history, and Zucker is the first player to score six consecutive team goals since Glen Murray did it for the Boston Bruins from Jan. 29 - Feb. 1, 2004, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. However the longest run in NHL history is seven goals, set by Cy Denney of the Ottawa Senators from Feb. 28 - March 7, 1921 and matched by Brian Noonan with the Chicago Blackahawks from Dec. 27-29, 1991.

Note that in beach volleyball, there is an additional statement that the server’s foot may not even go under the end line. 

There is no single official worldwide volleyball statistics definition. But we can take a look at a representative comprehensive source for definitions of volleyball statistics: 2015 NCAA Official Volleyball Statistics Rules. Their definition of “dig” is the following (in “Section 4—Digs”): 

Which means the answer for your first question is no, this is not a dig. And the answer for your second question is yes, this is still a dig, even though the attack was slowed by the block. Other official bodies or specific competitions might use a different definition, but I believe the basic principles would be the same. 

This too is a very bold statement; not only it's a bold statement but also a very subjective one. I am not a big fan of hockey and thus I do not utter a word about whether or not the game is better without the offside rule, but even if it did make the game more entertaining there are two logical pitfalls to your statement: 

So, no you cannot go and hit the ball carrier's hand to steal or block a shot, that would be a personal foul. 

I think it's very important to think about these two points. First of all no two sport are alike to the degree that one can argue a rule change in one would make sense in the other. Secondly I strongly disagree to the point of sports being an entertainment. I have to say it's a rather unfortunate attitude bred by North American leagues (NFL,NBA, MLB, NHL, MLS...) There are many important benefits of commercialized teams, but essentially the sportsmanship is dying with that attitude. The point with sports should not be about more goals, more TV deals, better ratings... The point with sports is fair play, sportsmanship, athleticism and morals.. all these icky sticky vague concepts that are hard to explain in words. To come back to the original question; offside rule makes sense, albeit being very encumbered and somewhat hard to understand. It essentially says; ... to score a fair goal, you have to work hard, run faster or outsmart your opponent being in an advantageous spot (by being lazy or blatantly lucky) is not "sportsmanly" (not sure if that word exists in English). And as a football enthusiast that has played way too many unofficial games/tournaments, I second that. I despise lazy players that stand in front of the goal waiting for the ball to come over to them so they can take a shot from 2m distance to the goal, while the other players are pushing themselves hard to play the game the right way. 

Also, I especially recommend watching teaching videos for referees available as a part of the FIVB Multimedia Teaching Material for Referees: First, click Net Rule Move in the left menu and watch the video. Then, navigate to rule 11 in the contents menu and click Jump to the videos to see a list of applicable video examples. 

Whether the hit itself was legal: Did the setter touch the ball within his own playing space? Was it a proper hit? (Was the ball not held/caught/thrown)? According to your image, the setter touched the ball beyond the net, above the opponent’s court. In that case, the setter made a fault of “reaching beyond the net”, signalled by the referee by a hand placed above the net, palm facing downwards. When the set is imperfect and the setter actually plays the ball towards the opponent’s court, it counts as an attack hit. And back-row players cannot complete an attack hit from the front zone when the ball is completely above the top of the net. This means that if the setter hits the ball completely above the top of the net towards the opponent’s court, it is an “attack hit fault” if the attack hit is completed, which means either the ball crosses the vertical plane of the net completely, or the opponent touches the ball.
