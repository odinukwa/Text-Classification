No, this wouldn't occur, due to something called orbital inclination. None of the planets orbit in exactly the same plane. Their orbits are a little tilted relative to each other. Some are easier to notice than others, but Mercury has a pretty big tilt (6 degrees) that would definitely be noticeable. This handy figure shows the inclination for all the planets: 

Although it is extremely rare, there have been cases of cancer being transmitted from one person to another through surgery or organ transplant. But in people with healthy immune systems this is extraordinarily rare even in whole organ transplants to such an extent that only a few cases are known. So it unless your villain also somehow weakened the victim's immune system, the chance of this actually working in practice is so small that it wouldn't be an effective strategy. A better approach might be to get some of the victim's own cells, induce cancer in them (such as with a cancer-causing virus), and implant those cells back into the victim. This would allow the villain to select healthy cells from a tissue that develops into hard-to-fight cancer. Since the cells are in culture, the villain would avoid the subject's immune system that would kill off many of the early cancer cells, allowing the cancer to develop more quickly. It would also allow the villain to inject metastatic (mobile) cancer cells directly into the victim's lymph nodes, which is pretty much a guaranteed death sentence for many types of cancers. If the villain wanted to get fancy, he or she could apply additional carcinogens (cancer-causing compounds) to speed up the process, and screen cells for particular cancerous mutations to further speed things up. The villain could also apply a bunch of anti-cancer drugs in increasing quantities one after another, allowing the cancer cells to develop resistance to the drugs. This would likely all seem natural to doctors, there shouldn't be any overt hint that foul play was involved. It would just seem like doctors missed the cancer until it was too late. However, if the villain didn't care about it seeming natural, he or she could directly genetically modify the cells, inserting cancer-causing genes and disabling genes that protect against cancer. Such genetic engineering would be obvious, but would also be faster and more reliable. Edit: added more details about using victim's own cells 

The reason agriculture developed was not time, there were no particular progressive changes in behavior or tool use that made agriculture possible. Agriculture became possible because of the environment. The ice age had ended, wild edible grasses were around and ripe for cultivation, and the climate was appropriate for semi-settled populations to develop. So the simplest way to delay the development of agriculture is delay the end of the last ice age. The ice age took, say, twice as long, giving you another few hundred thousand years. That would give you plenty of time. 

One advantage is that it makes you somewhat sensitive to radio waves. A more advanced magnetoreception sense could give you reasonably fine radio sensitivity. This could further help with navigation, allowing you to sense deep-space radio signatures during the day. It could also be used to sense lightning that is invisible to the naked eye. That could be useful in an area with heavy storms. And of course in the modern world it would be both very useful and very irritating. 

One possibility would be some sort of active material that reacts to the presence of disassemblers by destroying them. For example, by their nature many nanomachines are highly sensitive to electrical pulses. So design the material so that it releases an electric or microwave pulse if it gets deformed at an atomic scale in the way the disassemblers would deform it when trying to consume it. Another type of active material that could work would be a material composed of special-purpose disassemblers designed specifically to disassemble the disassemblers before they can disassemble the disassembler disassemblers (sorry, couldn't resist). This material could even incorporate the material from the disassemblers to grow. Yet another sort of active material is one that injects a virus that reprograms the disassemblers. This could then re-purpose them to help infect or destroy other disassemblers. 

One scenario I have heard is to seed the upper atmosphere with photosynthetic and chemosynthetic bacteria or archae that would break down the carbon dioxide and sulfur in the atmosphere, respectively. The large amount of sunlight would have the photosynthetic bacteria grow and the thick atmosphere would help both organisms stay airborne. Perhaps you could start with bacteria or archae that are highly resistant to acidity, temperature, and radiation. Then you could splice in genes for photosynthesis into one group and sulfur-eating into another. You wouldn't want to splice both into the same cells because then the cells would use whatever is most readily available rather than consuming both at the same time. This would result in lower temperatures (due to a reduced greenhouse effect), less toxic atmosphere, breathable oxygen, and clearer skies. However, it may take too long for your scenario. 

As you can see, there are large swaths of land with few or no trees. Plus the sloths would need to cross several very wide, fast-flowing rivers. So even ignoring issues with food, there is simply no route for them to get where you want them. 

It may seem silly, but semaphore (using flags to communicate) was a critical tool in Napoleon's victories. Semaphore towers spaced just at the edge of visible range allowed extremely rapid point-to-point communication across the entire continent of Europe. Within an urban environment, it would be even easier since they could be placed on taller buildings. Similarly, using something like Morse code with mirrors used to focus and reflect flashes of sunlight can be used over long distances, and signal lights can be used in a similar manner in the dark (which could be based on old-fashioned gas or wood lighthouses if electricity is no longer available). Regarding continents, most continents are connected to other continents by land. You can go between Europe, Asia, and Africa across land, and between North and South America. Further, the U.S. and Asia are connected by an island chain. I can't find the maximum distance between islands in the chain, but at least the average distance is well within the range of these sorts of systems. Similarly, it looks like the islands connecting Australia to Asia are also either within range or close to it. So all the inhabited continents could possibly be connected by such a system (perhaps with a few anchored towers in water to bridge a few larger gaps). 

The cheapest solution would probably be big rocks. Specifically, a simple pulley and a big rock held up by rope. Lift the rock, put the body underneath, drop the rock. Repeat until the bones are in too many pieces to do anything useful with. This could be automated with something akin to a windmill or waterwheel-powered flour mill. These are fairly grisly options but would be easily available to people with almost no money.
