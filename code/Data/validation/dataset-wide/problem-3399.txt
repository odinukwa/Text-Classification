The reason cernir (and the verbs based on it: discernir, concernir) and hendir are exceptions to this is that they are alternative forms of the -er verbs cerner and hender, and as such still act (in this regard) like their original forms when conjugated. 

 1. Though Italian does have the occasional doublet of these words retaining the Latin consonants, these are invariably learned borrowings or loanwords via other Romance languages that didn't undergo these changes, e.g. platea (borrowed); caviglia (through Old Provençal), clavicola (borrowed), masculo (borrowed) etc. Such learned borrowings also occur in Spanish e.g. clave, inflar etc. 

In Chinese number names, and both Korean number systems, the numbers follow strict base 10 representations: the name for any number from 11-19 is the name for 10 plus the name for the unit value. 

Now, in conclusion, let's reconsider the idea that to is "defective." The allegedly "defective" property of to is that it does not have inflected forms; how defective is that property, really? Notice that modal auxiliaries in fact lack uninflected forms. Are they defective as well? We might well say that to is defective, but we can only say so in the same capacity that we're willing to say modals are defective as well for their lacking uninflected forms. I'll quote the last couple few of "Auxiliaries: To's company" because I think it's appropriate (the paper argues in favor of an argument originally made by Geoffrey Pullum in 1982 that to is an auxiliary). 

The Old English letter <­g> (specifically not using the overdot as that is a much later convention) is a fickle beast: it pulled double duty as it represented both /g/ (as in <­græf>) and /j/ (as in <­gist>). Because English of the day had no grapheme like <­j>, and since it used <­y> only as a vowel (to mark the front-rounded vowel /y/), it had to adapt what letters it had to the phonetics of its words. Many Proto-Germanic words that had /*g-/ in them (like <*girnijaną>) ended up undergoing palatalisation of that /*g-/ to a palatal sound in Old English, i.e. what we assume to be /j/ (as in <­giernan>). One must really differentiate between orthography and phonetics here: the way a word is spelled has little effect on how it's pronounced. The letter <­g> in Old English was generally pronounced as /j/ when it was followed by a grapheme used for a front vowel, even if that vowel wasn't actually pronounced (or even, wasn't ever even a thing) there. As such, you'll see a lot of <­e> inserted into Old English words in places where they didn't belong only because the Anglo-Saxons had no other way they could think of to represent /j/; this could lead one to confusion (as it has led you too!) and might make you believe all such <­ge> were pronounced as a plain, vowelless /j/. This isn't the case, as the <­e> in this <­ge> could easily have come from a diphthong, as is the case in <­geard> (whence your <­geardum>) that had the short diphthong <­ea>, or in verbs such as <­giefan> /jiefan/ and <­gēotan> /je:otan/. On a bit of a sidenote, you'll also see that, due to this palatalisation of Germanic /*g-/, almost no native, directly inherited English word actually has an initial /g/ before a front vowel; words such as <­gift> and <­give> are usually loans from a language with /g/ in such a position (most commonly Old West Norse); the only exceptions to this are English words that underwent i-umlaut (<­geese> is a good example) after the g-palatalisation had already happened. 

Question I've noticed a phenomenon in (Central) Catalan speech that I had seen no mention of when studying the language. In words with a final -nys or -lls, the s is assimilated and becomes palatal (or possibly ). e.g. 

1. Note that unlike Italian, in dialects of Catalan that have this feature it can also apply to plurals of kinship terms. 

A famous example is the Mbabaram (extinct Australian Aboriginal language) word for dog, dog. Some further examples are listed in the above Wikipedia page, e.g.: 

How old are your students? I can't imagine that the momentary giggle that some of these words might raise would continue for very long or be detrimental to the lesson. The only one I would avoid is , since therein lies a pretty offensive slur. Maybe avoid the ones which contain very uncommon words too, for the sake of familiarity to the audience. Everything else seems pretty benign, removed of context. 

This answer is based on chapter 2 (section 8: "Infinitival to) of Minimalist Syntax: Exploring the structure of English by Andrew Radford (2004), and "Auxiliaries: To's company" (2012) by Robert Levine in Journal of Linguistics. Infinitival to is an auxiliary. It is the same category as the other auxiliaries, but it is considered "defective" in a single respect; it does not have inflected forms. It's as simple as that. All the properties you can come up with in which to seems to differ from finite auxiliaries, it shares with non-finite auxiliaries. What are some reasons to believe to is an auxiliary? The most intuitive one is the structural parallel. Like other auxiliaries, to takes as a complement a verb phrase headed by a bare verb or non-finite auxiliary. 

(My immediate thought was that all instances of Latin /ou/ became /oβ/ ~ /ob/ in Spanish, but this seems to be contradicted by the fact that /au/ and /eu/ remained in many words.) 

(Note: Catalan, Sicilian, Friulian follow the same pattern as French and Italian.) Classical Latin itself is regular up until 18 and 19, where representations translated as "2 from 20" and "1 from 20" are the norm (if this seems unexpected, remember the roman numeral representation for 19 is XIX, "10 and 1 from 10"). While it might seem strange that the 'flip' in the Romance languages representations wasn't present in Classical Latin, switched forms such as "decem et septem" for 17 can be found in some Latin texts, and was a feature of some rural and lower class Latin speech that was presumably particularly prevalent among the settlers and soldiers, whose speech directly affected modern Romance languages. 

This is more of a subjunctive thing, with "it's important that you be late" vs. "it's important that you do not be late". Nothing imperative about it as far as I can tell except that it has the exact same form. It's probably sounding bad to you because the subjunctive is mostly obsolete and has fallen out of use but it's still there in places and native intuitions. 

While I can't give a definitive answer, I can just say it's somewhat to very common. Within the Indo-European family, almost all the branches have at one point had vowel length (Germanic, Italic, Slavic, Indo-Aryan, Greek, Anatolian, Celtic etc.) and many have had it re-innovated (certain English dialects' treatment of /eə > e:/, Belgian French compensatory lengthening before a lost /s/ etc.) . Outside the IE family, there's Uralic where vowel length is quite widespread amongst almost every member of the family, then in Korean, Japanese, certain members of Turkic, Bantu, Mongolian, Afro-Asiatic, Uto-Aztecan, Athabaskan, Wakashan, Algonquian, Mayan etc. This just shows that it's not really a local phenomenon as vowel length appears in about any area where there are languages; some areas might have vowel length more common, though.

This seems to be a compromise between censoring the word completely, and maintaining 'readability' of what the word is (see here for an example of complaint over the ambiguity of censoring which only leaves the initial letter intact). But note the inconsistency when censoring, for example, bloody: 

Perhaps the most widespread argument for the analysis of to as an auxiliary is that it is capable of elliptical stranding, a property characteristic of auxiliaries. Notice that both finite and non-finite auxiliaries have this property. 

The fact that to follows negation is therefore not an argument against its status as an auxiliary; it should actually be considered evidence that it is. Another property which comes as a consequence of to's being a non-finite auxiliary is that it cannot undergo inversion, which is what a previous answer seems to be getting at with the claim that to must follow "complementizers, foci, [and] subjects." Tensed auxiliaries undergo inversion in English, for instance in questions and stylistic inversion, but non-finite auxiliaries do not; as a non-finite auxiliary, to is completely unexceptionable in this respect. Here is a summary of the above evidence that to is a non-finite auxiliary:
