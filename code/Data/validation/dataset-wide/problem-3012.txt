Classical propositional logic is truth-functional, that is the truth of propositions are determined by the assignment of truth-values taken from {false,true} to the atomic propositions. And it is this that gives the semantics for the logic. But noting that {false, true} is actually a boolean algebra, and in fact the smallest one, can we generalise to a B-valent classical propositional logics by taking values from some boolean algebra B, which need not be finite? It seems to me that the usual completeness and soundness theorems should hold in this context. Is that right? 

has sense and reference: one can ask whether the proper names - unicorn and beautiful refer; one can argue that these names occur in the corpus of written works, that they also occur in speech, that they are not arbitrary strings of letters; thus they refer, but to what? and how? A unicorn does not occur in the world; but in a fictional world; and in these fictional worlds things are described as beautiful or ugly ie they are the properties of fictional objects. This is their reference; but what then is their sense? For a proposition to gain meaning it is not sufficient to focus solely on its logical form; and nor is it enough to gain an understanding of its truth by way of what this proposition refers to in the world - real or fictive; but also by what these words - unicorn and beautiful mean - this is their sense. Note: a vacuous truth is a proposition that adds nothing to our understanding; that unicorns exist in the fictional world of Narnia, and that there they are considered both wild and beautiful adds to our knowledge of this fictional world. Thus, it is not a vacuous truth. A vacuous truth is generally context dependent; it generally means something that is true by reason of its logical form; an example of which is the proposition 'a unicorn is a unicorn'; this is true, but adds nothing to what we didn't know before - thus vacuously true. 

wikipedia has a good article on this: Naturalism is the philosophical doctrine that only natural phenomena are the proper object of study. It divides into two, metaphysical (your intrinsic), and methodological, (your provisional). The metaphysical version insists that there can be no non-natural phenomena. The methodological version suggests that when the working scientist comes across phenomena that can't be explained in the categories that have worked so far, he may need to find new categories or concepts to address it. Thus, consider a possible world where there are ghosts; and one evening when Richard Feynman is working late in a lab, he sees a ghost; being a methodological naturalist, he does not immediately exclude it as a possible object of study - but says, or rather thinks to himself, excitedly "this is a strange and new phenomena that needs investigating"; and looks for a new method by which this can be done. A naturalistic metaphysician like Dennett will suppose otherwise; he might say drily to no-one in particular "I've seen an illusion" or perhaps "I'm hallucinating"; or even "some-one is playing a prank"; for there can be no non-natural things in the world; and all natural things have been accounted for. 

A functional sign is simply the sign of the function; the function being what the sign signifies. He expands what he means by this: 

I'm not sure that the sentence that Hitchens quotes is a Zen Koan; but a parody of one to express his irritation. I'm no expert on Vedic philosophy, but perhaps the ninth couplet from the Isha Upanishad can throw some light on this little placard that so irritated him; the translation is by Yeats together with Swami Purohit: 

The classical Turing machine comes in a variety of different flavours. The basic version is the one first outlined by Turing, the non-deterministic version allows finite branching at every computation and in which every branch is followed, or in the probabilistic one, a single branch is randomly chosen. A Non-deterministic turing machine provably solves exactly the same problems as the basic one, but it does it exponentially faster, and the probabilistic machines can be efficiently simulated by the basic one with polynomial slowdown. Hence it appears that despite differences these flavours, as far as solvability goes (but not computational power) are equivalent. What does the qualifier Quantum add here. The article in Wikipedia is not clear here on: a. How does it differ from the classical version in terms of solvability. That is does it solve exactly the same class of problems, or do they differ in some essential aspect. b. How do they differ in terms of computational power? The simplest guess would be exponential speedup - which would take us to non-determinsitic turing machines. Is this right? 

Take the axiom of Comprehension that was introduced by Zermelo. This, as usually stated has one instance for every single formula. Presumably this is to contain the axiom within first-order logic. Still, as a technical manuevre it seems something of a hack. Unless of course there is a deeper motivation behind it, or that it signals something deep in the structure of first-order ZFC. Does it? 

Good question. The same question can be asked of ordinary natural numbers, the negative numbers, infinitesimals as well as various orders of infinity. The philosophy known as Mathematical Platonism argues that whereas we can see one bottle or three chairs we do not see the numbers one or three, so they contemplate a world outside of time and space - Platos Heaven, where these numbers exist. One could argue this is where we also place the more exotic notions of numbers. Aristotle when he contemplated the infinite distinguished between actual infinity & potential infinity, and stated that actual infinities cannot exist but that we can imagine a potential infinity. So, even in Platos Heaven, we cannot find the infinite. But this doesn't appear to be correct, given what mathematicians have discovered, for they might say, the potential infinity is 1,2,3,...; and we can complete it at the first ordinal omega,- which I'll write as w; but then our friend, who has been watching this demonstration, and who rather mysteriously calls himself Socrates, says "well, that isn't truly infinity - infinity is where you stop because you cannot go further, but I see here that you can, for I can continue with w+1, w+2, ..; and then one completes this one gets 2w! And so the pattern repeats, whenever the series is completed, we can see it again as the first term in a new series". In mathematical parlance w is the smallest infinite ordinal, and its cardinality is equal to the smallest infinite cardinal; the next infinite cardinal, when is at an immense distance when looked at ordinally. We've already discussed the following series ie 1,2,3,..., w,w+1,W+2,..,w2,w3,..w^2,..,w^3,..,w^w,..w^w^w,..,w^w^w^... and this completes at what is called epsilon-0. This is still much smaller than the first uncountable ordinal, which is called omega-1. In fact to reach this using the kind of notation we've been doing is impossible, and there is an ordinal that measures exactly this called the Church-Kleene ordinal - omega-1-CK. And this brings in a very useful understanding of what ordinals can be said to measure, at least in mathematical terms - that is proof-theoretic strength. The strength of arithemtic is epsilon-0; a natrual way to understand this is to imagine a proof of a theorem as a tree of propositions and note that trees are have ordinal type epsilon-0. So at least we know that ordinals are useful to mathematician, in that they can be applied to something outside the theory of ordinals themselves. But this, though diverting, doesn't tackle your central complaint, which is are these ordinals obtained in the real world. Now the paradox you mention is reminiscent of Zenos paradox of Achilles & the tortoise; and you mention the classical solution to this problem. Another solution is that there is physically a limit to subdivision - the atomic structure of matter, and perhaps of space. However, as one begins to think about them, as you have, one begins to realise that the classical solution is only a solution, and perhaps not the only solution, and even perhaps the wrong solution - meaning not the best. Socrates, again steps in here and says: "Well, this is all very well, and very good; but this all about infinity in the guise of magnitude; and there are other senses in which this mysterious term the infinite can be used. What about the all? I see for example, in set theory one has the universal set, the set that contains everything, and so must contain every ingenious conception that you have of the infinite, and in fact those which you haven't conceived of yet". Of course, Russell discovered that this notion leads directly to a paradox, which he solved by inventing type theory, and then one sees that again one gets a hierarchy, types, types of types, types of types of types...; so however one looks at it, infinity is not itself within mathematics, it always remains in potentia. Socrates interrupts here, "you forget Spinoza, he had a beautiful system for describing everything, the all - the infinite of extension and thought, the reality of the real and the unreality of the unreal as minor modes in the major mode of the infinite of the Good and God; for whilst Plato showed us three worlds and Descarte reduced this to two, Spinoza asked - why two? - if there is one, it is sufficient unto itself, but where there is two, there will be more. It is possibly too beautiful to be true; possibly too beautiful to be understood". Yes, and too beautiful to be untrue and too beautiful to explain...
