A congressional act granting an executive "kill switch" for the internet was proposed in June 2010. It was called the Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act, and it never came up for vote in Congress (i.e. died). There is a revised version of the bill in Congress now (introduced in February 2011) called the Cybersecurity and Internet Freedom Act of 2011. According to the bill's sponsor, Joe Lieberman, the revised version contains no kill switch. However, it seems that this may not be true, according to this CNET article: 

It seems that if this is so, they could label all ISPs "critical" and prevent anyone from accessing the internet. It would probably be a lot more paperwork, but I don't think that would discourage them. So yes, this new bill (which is still in the early stages of legislature, as far as I can tell), seems to contain a weakened form of the "kill switch", but not an executive one. It wouldn't be up to the President, or any other single person, but an entire governmental department. You can read the entire bill here, but unless you can speak legalese, you might not be able to make sense of any of it, let alone know where to start. (It's unfortunate that I can't really answer your question directly from reading the bill, but such is American politics-- have to rely on sometimes-dubious third parties like news outlets to interpret legislature by proxy). 

The work of Nakahara et al. concerning vitamins L1 and L2 being essential for lactation is considered refuted in the sense that others found multiple generations could be bred living on diets that are deficient of vitamins L1 and L2. See Milk: the Mammary Gland and Its Secretion, volume II at page 171 which cites to the following article as an example: Lactation and Reproduction on Highly Purified Diets Nature volume 150, page 318 (12 September 1942) 

where "constitutional right" means the United States constitution (as opposed to a state constitution). Therefore, each state needs to be considered individually as to which telephone rights are afforded persons arrested. In Nevada: 

There seems to be plenty of anecdotal evidence (currently the 4th google result for "multiple vaccines") to confirm this, but according to the CDC, there have been studies which have found no adverse health effects associated with multiple simultaneous vaccinations (emphasis mine): 

Yes, this can happen with water, and in fact other liquids as well. According to the UNSW School of Physics, this is called superheating, and it occurs when a liquid is heated to a temperature slightly above its boiling point without the liquid starting to boil. The result is an unstable liquid that can boil (steam) violently when a foreign object (i.e. instant coffee, tongue, spoon, etc.) contacts the liquid (I'll explain how/why later in this answer). This violent boiling is the "explosion" referred to in your question, and it can be quite dangerous. (Note that this is not, by definition, an actual explosion, but colloquially, it may be referred to as such. See the comment by dm.skt below.) Superheating occurs when a liquid is heated in a smooth container*, such as a brand-new mug or bowl, for a long time in a microwave. The smooth container prevents steam bubbles from forming on the surface of the container as the liquid is heated. The formation of steam bubbles is a crucial step of boiling; without steam bubbles, the liquid cannot boil, and this is why superheating is possible. Introducing a non-smooth object into superheated water allows the water to form steam bubbles on the irregular surface of the object, leading to a potentially rapid boil of the water. *Note: As a container is used and/or washed, microscopic abrasions and scratches will accumulate on the interior surface of the container, whether from stirring with a spoon or scrubbing. Thus, the likelihood of superheating occurring with any given container decreases each time the container is used and superficially scratched, because steam bubbles will form more easily the more scratches are present. 

The Swiss airforce monitors its airspace permanently, 24 hours a day 365 days a year. However, means to intervene in the form of airborne aircraft are usually available only during office hours. Exceptions to this rule include special security situations, such as during the annual World Economic Forum in Davos. The last publicized case of a lack of intervention occurred on February 17th, 2014. Around 4:30am a hijacker forced an Ethiopian Airlines passenger flight from Addis Abbeba bound for Rome to land in Geneva. Italian and later French fighters escorted the plane, but Swiss fighters were not available and did not intervene.

The above passage is from the chapter Birth, Functions and Avatars of the word Racism in the book The Force of Prejudice: On Racism and Its Doubles The book also quotes Charles Maurras as saying 25 March 1895: 

There is a review article: Effects of reiki in clinical practice: a systematic review of randomised clinical trials International Journal of Clinical Practice Volume 62, Issue 6, pages 947â€“954, June 2008.

Dr. Kalam's state visit to Switzerland was originally planned for May 27-28, 2005. The original official media release (not available in English) emphasized a visit of the capital and the canton of Berne. It also mentioned visits to the Swiss Federal Institutes in Zurich and Lausanne during the president's stay, and referred to a more detailed program to be published later. A second official media release did schedule the visits to the two Swiss Federal Institutes on May 26, "prior to his state visit to Switzerland". Dr. Kalam also visited CERN in Geneva on that day. The official state visit was thus preceded by an unofficial visit to science institutions in Switzerland. Kalam signed agreements between India and CERN as a European institution, so his visit to CERN could not be part of a formal state visit to Switzerland. Possibly some spokesperson mentioned that May 26 would be an unofficial "science day" preceding the official, formal state visit. Indian newspaper articles might have misinterpreted such a statement as an official declaration. No Swiss sources, neither official nor in newspapers, can be found on a formal declaration for that day. 

The CDC also mentions that separating vaccinations is more likely to cause discomfort to the child, which makes sense-- less stress to get all of them done in one visit, I would think. The CDC does not cite any of these studies on that page, but here's a study that I found. This is the summary (again, emphasis added): 

There seems to be some criticism of such studies. This criticism in particular (not all criticism) comes from the National Health Federation, which has a history of promoting claims that vaccines are dangerous, so I'm inclined to disregard it. So, in summary, no, studies have shown that it is not dangerous to have several vaccines at the same time. 

There are numerous issues with the statement in the OP. The New York Times is getting its information from the article $URL$ That source leaves out the following fatal, confirmed terrorism, US incidents found in the terrorism database (as well as other incidents flagged as "possible" terrorism): 07/23/2015 shooting by John Russell Houser at theater 12/20/2014 shooting by Ismaaiyl Brinsley 12/18/2014 shooting by Justin Nojan Sullivan "so he could purchase a rifle to carry out an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) inspired attack" 11/01/2013 shooting by Paul Ciancia at Los Angeles International Airport (also, if the NYT phrase "after 9/11" on the graph is taken literally, the anthrax attacks are omitted) On the other hand, the "new america" source adds incidents that are not considered terrorism (or even possible terrorism) by the database, specifically: -a 2012 shooting of police -a 2011 murder by Isaac Aguigui and others of his wife and unborn child and two others -a 2011 murder by David Pedersen and Holly Grigsby of Pedersen's father and stepmother and two others -a 2010 murder at a Carlisle, PA gun range -a 2009 shooting of police officers when they responded to a domestic dispute call -a 2009 murder in Brockten, MA -a 2004 Tulsa, OK bank robbery The "new america" article originally just graphed "right wing" and "jihadist" attacks. The New York Times relabeled the ones that were supposedly "right wing" as "Non-Islamic" and the ones labeled "jihadist" as "Islamic". All the incidents that "new america" decided to add were labeled as "right wing". Of the 18 incidents that "new america" labeled "right wing", 7 were not in the terrorism database. Other factors to consider are: 

TCS, a Swiss automobile club, has performed such tests in 2013. The study itself has not been published, but I have received a copy on request and the permission to show below table extracted from it. Other references to this study (in German) can be found in an article in their monthly magazine, a campaign to encourage switching off the engine, and similar articles. 

Translations: The left column shows the tested car model, its year of construction, and the type of fuel (Benzin for gasoline). The second column shows the measured consumption in grams per warm start, the third column the presence of a start-stop-system (ja=yes, nein=no). The right column indicates after how many seconds switching the engine off saves fuel. In conclusion, you should switch off your engine when you expect that your stop lasts for 5-10 seconds or more. This test focuses only on fuel-efficiency. Comparing the fuel savings with potential service cost is unrealistic in my view, as fuel prices vary widely (in time due to the oil price and by location due to taxes and subsidies) and should also include external costs related to emissions as well as fines (60 CHF in Switzerland for not switching off, though rarely enforced). 

Both of which further confirm that the offending verse of the poem began circulating due to publication in the Corriere d'Italia 5 January 1909 of the letter of Vincenzo Caudo, editor of the La Scintilla newspaper in Messina. 

And the nepetalactones occur as E,Z and Z,E isomers, which differ in repellency activity. The 2001 Science Daily article mentioned in the OP says "[Chris] Peterson says nepetalactone is about 10 times more effective than DEET because it takes about one-tenth as much nepetalactone as DEET to have the same effect." In 2006 the same Chris Peterson and coauthors wrote Natural Insect Repellents: Activity against Mosquitoes and Cockroaches which gives quantitative results for catnip essential oil and DEET. In some individual tests, when initially applied, catnip essential oil nominally showed greater repellency, but it is not stated to be statistically significant (see "Treatments with the same letter are not significantly different by Tukey analysis at [alpha] = 0.05." in each of Figs. 3-5). Furthermore, catnip essential oil was shown to have statistically significant decline in effectiveness over a 3 hour period, while DEET showed no decline.
