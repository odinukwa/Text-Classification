In the 1970s or 80s I read an article claiming that until recently crossbows were very inaccurate. This was in a discussion of siege warfare & castle defense. I now doubt that information, since compound xbows have been around for many thousands of years. Currently, xbows are as accurate as pistols at modest (30-40 yard) ranges. Scopes are necessary. There is no, I repeat, no safe way to shoot a xbow at someone. You risk maiming or killing them. As you seem to know, bows are used to hunt both fish and birds with strings attached see, for example Wikipedia Bowfishing. I'd guess the accuracy of such projectiles is miserable at any distance more than a few yards. Increasing muzzle velocity (or whatever it's called for a bolt) should increase distance, but will also reduce accuracy while at the same time making injury more likely. Tasers have maximum range of 35 ft and use compressed gas. Serious injuries are rare...at least, so says the law enforcement agencies that use them. Last idea, have you considered a stream of water? I guess getting a continuous 30 ft stream is unlikely... 

Vacuum tube transportation. What in the world is that?! I understand that air resistance increases the amount of energy required to move an object around in an atmosphere, and at high velocities (a typical car's main power need above about 40 mph is overcoming wind/air resistance, depending on its shape). At lower speeds, other sources of inefficiencies are important (including both engine and power chain inefficiencies/losses as well as friction. (Without friction, wheels wouldn't work, otoh). Banks use vacuum tubes to suck the capsule into the bank and then suck it back to the car. Similar systems can be used to deliver messages and small packages around a building or perhaps even locations even farther apart. I'm guessing this is what you mean. There's a real problem with this system. Vacuum doesn't suck. Air pressure pushes. So, for such a system to work, you have to fill the tube in back of the direction it is moving with air. This is a non-starter for larger tubes (or larger distances) assuming you don't want to take hours or days/weeks between capsules. The reason is all the air you put in the system to push with, you have to take out to empty the tube again. The other thing you might mean is using a tube to reduce the air resistance for something like magnetic or electric propulsion. Could you do that? Sure. How often would you have to shut it down to seal leaks? Often. Would it ever be at a high vacuum? Probably not. So, since it will be more and more beneficial to reduce air resistance as speed and distance increases, does it make any sense to deliver small packages this way? Well, I don't see it. Its like mail boxes. Some people (apartments especially) have a mail box (or slot) that is the size of a 100 - 200 sheets of paper (8Â½ x 11) (some are even smaller). Some are larger, and the traditional rural route (USPS) mail boxes come in two sizes, the larger is about the size of maybe 3 shoe boxes. Either you need many different sized tubes (for each address!!!!) or you need one huge one, and the capsule will be sending mostly air (and itself) from place to place. Enormously wasteful. So, no, I wouldn't say it's "feasible". There are some people who are trying to attract the money to build a magnetic levitation system running in a low vacuum tube underground to move people 10s and 100s of miles between cities. These systems would be slow to get to speed, and would require very, very careful use of magnetic acceleration and near perfect computer control to work acceptably. You can get to high speeds - eventually - but remember you'll probably be spending long times speeding up and slowing down compared to more traditional systems. My guess is such systems will be so full of leaks, that they'll never work like they should (and hence be more expensive and less profitable (or more money loosing). 

You'll not be surprised to learn the the US military has looked at exoskeletons to help soldiers on the battlefield. With current technology, the results show clearly that using the exo-legs is more strenuous for the soldier. Rather than easing their burden, it makes it worse! This says something pretty clearly about 3 billion years of evolution being pretty good at optimizing us, and the difficulty in improving on it. Your scenario assumes that more blood means more oxygen will be available to the muscle cells AND that the limiting metabolite is O2. I direct you to Wikipedia/Muscle fatigue for more information. You'll note that it doesn't mention O2 as a factor. So, I think your question's answer boils down to: for someone with poor physical conditioning, it would probably help a lot. For someone in excellent physical condition, it would probably help marginally. You'd be supplying more nutrients - such as phosphcreatine - and I assume removing more metabolic wastes. The question is, where do you put the shunts? Well there's two obvious choices: into the femoral artery (and vein). Gosh, you better hope nothing goes wrong: you can bleed out in seconds if you cut your femoral artery. The other "obvious" choice is splicing into the aorta or iliac artery (and vein). If this doesn't also sound dangerous, then you're not paying attention. It's believed that body armor has increased femoral exsanguination rates, I don't know why. It seems to me that in theory two hearts (if properly coordinated, a big if) could be better than one - and that's part of what we're talking about. Whether in real world practice, they'd be well enough coordinated is a different question. And you'd need the extra weight of the pump, filter, nutrients, control and monitoring circuitry - built in such a way as to be as efficient as a system developed (by trial and error) over 3 billion years. But let's say we grow a human heart, lungs, kidneys, liver (all no doubt genetically modified/augmented) and put them in a box on your back then hook you into them via a serious hole in your abdomen (bacterial infections, anyone?) and you get maybe double your current stamina - hey, why not triple? This begs the question: for what reason? We're not the best running animals anyway. Would you start with a Fiat 500 to design the fastest car in the world? 

I'd be very interested in learning about the accidents which occurred because 100 bit numbers were inadequate for the task? Please cite your source for this (dubious, imho) claim. You imply that engineers use "formulas" for calculations without having a clue about what their limits are. Well, I'm sure some people aren't motivated enough or educated enough to bother finding out whether the "black box" can be trusted. Hopefully, those aren't the engineers making the decisions for any project where human life is at risk. Your question assumes a level of incompetence which is not typical. Oh, I should also add that the calculus of determining errors propagating through numerical calculations is a mature discipline. 

Dude, you're asking about two dots the size (diameter) of earphone jacks. We don't see everything our eyes register - our brains 'wallpaper' much of our visual field with what we expect to be there. There's no reason why a magical cloak couldn't add back some light for the visible light our eyes stopped. There's no reason why it couldn't behave the same way as earphones with sound cancellation. Sure there'd be a lag, but on the scale of our response time (tenths of seconds or longer) there's plenty of time to recreate the necessary light "on the other side". 

There's no reason a gun or cannon wouldn't survive if well protected from water and humidity. (Picture it submersed in oil). It is just false to say these things have to be maintained. Water exposure happens in several ways: most obvious by direct exposure to liquid water (rain, river floods, etc.) less obvious is by humid air and temperature variation leading to condensation (of course, some materials are directly sensitive to humidity). So, storage conditions are critical in this discussion. I know virtually nothing about the long term stability of the gun powders and primer compositions used today. It could be true that after 100 or more years the bullet wouldn't fire. I would invite anyone who believe 100 years would cause failure to stand in front of a gun loaded with such a bullet and allow someone to pull the trigger. There's two questions: corrosion and degradation. Without water, corrosion will be much reduced (I'm not willing to say eliminated, since the decomposition of either the primer compound or the propellant might lead to corrosive volatiles which could attack either the copper primer cap or the bullet casing) and the slow reaction of the ingredients in the primer or powder leading to either becoming inert. As I said, I'm not familiar with the chemistry: there's two possibilities:1) the decomposition products cause an increasing rate of degradation or 2) they don't. If they don't the rate of decomp will get slower and slower. Since I've used 10 year old rounds, I'm sure 1000 year old round will work under scenario 2. If scenario 1 is true, then I'm certain someone has studied it and the information might be public. The real problem I have is the assumption that the yokels in 2516 will lack the ability to make their own modern weapons. I think you need a "just so" story for that to have happened. Maslow's Hierarchy incorrectly (imho) put safety as less important than food, water, air and shelter. IMHO, its just as important, guns are a key technology and are almost certain never to be "lost". 

You haven't adequately described your world. The first tool we had was our hands and we made hand tools. OK, mermaids can do that. The next was fire. A problem. So, what do we do about internal combustion, or worse, the Iron or Bronze age? Or glass? Or chemistry. I suspect development of a technological society under the sea would progress through biological means. Use of animals for energy, use of electric eels (say) as batteries. There's no reason that such a society wouldn't "invent" sailboats or dirigibles. The idea that our subs "occupy" the oceans is so laughable, that I won't say anything more about it. The merpeople have no need to "occupy" the land...how many undersea colonies are you aware of? They would no more want to live up here than we would down there. I'd suggest that sailing balloons is the way to go. They could only go as far as their feeble (unless you give them nuclear or petrochemical engines) energy sources would allow. But with enough caching along the way, it might be only a moderate problem - to organized (ie governmental) groups.
