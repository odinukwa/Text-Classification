Having started Parkour a year ago at the age of 30, I think Matt's answer is not very helpful for older people interested in getting into it. Most people I see practising parkour are in their early 20s or younger and they all appear to have started in their teens. My Background My main activities are rock climbing and CrossFit. My experience as a 30 yo The problem with parkour is that you are training in urban areas. If you are interested in 'pure' parkour, this is pretty safe. There are no tricks involved. Just getting from point A to point B efficiently. Landing on concrete is quite unpleasant though. You need a fair amount of conditioning to do it. The main problem areas are with your lower body since this take the majority of the stress. There is a lot of jumping (and landing), twisting and balancing. You'll want to do various types of squats, lunges, single leg lifts, single leg step ups, calf raises and balance work. I also like agility ladder drills. Also ankle flexibility and leg flexibility is important. You may do a precision onto a angled surface and range of motion will be important to get your COG in the right place. And some moves like a cat pass or underbar over an obstacle benefit from good flexibility. Parkour actually exposed a lot of weaknesses in my lower body for me. I did classes first, and then realised what areas I needed to work on. As a rock climber I didn't find upper body strength and flexibility to be an issue. Other than learning to roll correctly, upper body moves are quite basic. Strength helps of course, but no serious gymnastics work is needed. 

I'll try to answer your question from my own experiences. I used to smoke a lot, almost a package of cigarettes daily. I still had a fair amount of strength, and am a slim person by natural. At some point, I decided to work on my endurance, my stamina. I ran on the treadmill next to an overweight woman, and couldn't run more than five minutes without gasping for air. My heart was pumping so hard it made me dizzy. That made me realise - being 24 years old at that time - that it was time to change my life drastically. How did I accomplish this? Build up gradually, and be determined. The mental conquer was - for me - far greater than the physical, as you have to keep pushing yourself further, even though it aches, burns in your lungs. I started riding a stationary bike, as the running was too intense at first. I didn't ride it daily but every other day, as I wanted to allow my slowly recovering physique and muscles to recover fully before the next workout. After two months, I started jogging on the treadmill, doing intervals. This way, I could push my endurance further and further, whilst giving myself time to recover. I followed this scheme: 

I am not a good runner. I am definitely not a distance runner. My foray into running styles was an exercise to manage a minor knee injury. So my running style is entirely to do with injury prevention. I've tried forefoot running, but that gave me very sore calfs. I can't say that it is wrong. I still tend to land more on my forefoot if I sprint. Still a big improvement on my legs and knees. At my gym, the trainer has adopted the Pose method. As far as I understand, this encourages a mid-foot landing. As far as comfort and injury prevention goes, this has been the best method for me. Be aware, the Pose running website is really bad and looks like a scam. But worth a try if injury prevention is your main goal. 

I started skipping when I started CrossFit. If you are not good at skipping and are trying to get good enough for fitness, you should look for a rope that spins nicely, is moderately thick and isn't too heavy. 

I have read about the Five Finger shoes, also on here, but I stil have a question on the Return On Investment of buying these Five Finger shoes. I have read that they wear down more easily. My workout programme is mainly bodybuilding and I join spinning class for cardio. In what way will I benefit from wearing these shoes as opposed to "normal" sneakers. I do have read about avoiding shoes with a compressible sole. Baring in mind that I do mainly body building, why should I buy them? And if so, which ones? 

Next, I take the weight of my exercise and do the workout. Sometimes I do a dropset ( use the heaviest weight first ) or the opposite ( build up the weight - sometimes combined with less repititions ) I don't know if this is the most effective way. I found this to be perfect for my body and muscles. 

Rest days usually means mobility, foam rolling and stretching. Total workload is a little less than yours. So I think your work load is OK. But I prefer having clear rest days. I definitely benefit. The workout never really changes. Fundamental upper body strength is probably very similar to fundamental leg strength (squat, squat some more). I do enjoy some of the more gymnastic work, so I sometimes throw in some handstand drills, back levers, front levers, muscle ups etc just for fun. 

Personally, I have one of the fancy Buddy Lee Aero Speed ropes. A little more expensive, but it's been a really great rope. Edit: The typical material is PVC, not nylon! 

One hand up, match, other hand up. Go as high as possible, remembering to have enough energy to come back down. Come back down the reverse way. One hand down, match, other hand down. One hand up, match. First hand down, match. Repeat. Keep one hand on the same rung. Move the opposite hand up one rung. Keep moving the same hand up until you can't go any higher. At your limit, cut loose with your feet and then put your feet back on the same rung. Match your top hand with the lower hand directly. Do other side. Reach up with one hand as high as possible. Then campus down with that same hand until you match on the starting rung. Do other hand. Lots of other ideas and patterns ... 

I have started to try out the StrongLifts 5x5 program. Started a week ago. But, I have a rowing machine at home that I'd like to keep using. So, what I'm wondering is 

Not sure what the muscle is called, or if there is more than one, but seems like there is a muscle under my feet going from somewhere close to the heel and forward to where the toes are "attached". I seem to get tired there quite easily, and sometimes it hurts a little (mostly like a sore muscle hurts) after walking a lot or jumping around. Is there a way I can strengthen this muscle? Preferably without any equipment. 

Should I? Or will it ruin things for SL? If it's not a problem, when should I do it? Inbetween the SL days or same day? Before or after? 

Rock climbing is largely a skill sport, so to get better, climb more. Being generally fit also helps, but to be a better rock climber, you need to climb a lot. If you want to specifically do extra work for rock climbing you should start off with identifying your weaknesses. From my experience in my climbing gym, the biggest weaknesses are grip strength and flexibility. Things you can do at home You can train your grip with something like the Black Diamond forearm trainer. You could probably just find a block of wood and just squeeze it. Real holds don't have any give after all. Don't use a regular grip trainer. Your closed grip is probably relatively strong. You probably want to train your open handed grip positions (like you're holding a fat hold). You can also try Metolius Rock Rings. They are like a pair of mini hang boards that you can just hang somewhere. They come with an example program. Flexibility is also worth working on as increased flexibility open up moves that you may not be able to perform at the moment. I find leg flexibility more limited than shoulder/arm flexibility. I'm not confident in prescribing stretches but perhaps someone at your gym can give you a few pointers. Add drills to your regular climbing time Use the campus boards and hang boards in the climbing gym. You can do various drills before you climb:
