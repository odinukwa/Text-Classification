Then Holmes reaches through the open window and tries to open the shutters. This proves that in the late 19th century some English buildings had interior shutters. $URL$ In The Fellowship of the Ring, chapter 10, "Strider", in a room at the Prancing Pony Inn at Bree: "He then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtains together." Franck Demoncourt may be surprised to see exterior shutters in France, but I as an American am only familiar with exterior shutters. The quotes from those two classic stories may be the only times I ever heard of interior shutters before reading this question. 

The principality associated with the reign of Henry VI did exist, but it wasn't connected to the Earldom of Chester. Go to the website Regnal Chronologies - section Pretenders - section British Islands - section Isle of Wight. The first part of that section deals with succession to the title of Lord of Wight, the second with the succession to Henry Beauchamp, Earl and Duke of Warwick, who was created King of Wight by his friend King Henry VI in 1444. $URL$ According to the site, the present heir to the medieval Lords of Wight is Hugh Courtenay, 18th earl of Devon. But he died in 2015 and the present heir is his son Charles Peregrine Courtenay (born 19750, 19th Earl of Devon. The present heir to the Medieval King of Wight, Henry Beauchamp, Earl and Duke of Warwick, should be Michael Simon Abney-Hastings (born 1975), 15th Earl of Loudoun 

The flag design most closely associated with Napoleon would be his personal command flag. If he had one. Pending the discovery of the design of any personal flag of Napoleon, the flag design most associated with him would be the regimental colors carried on the same staffs as the eagles of his regiments. This site: $URL$ Depicts the French regiment colors in the 1804, 1812, and 1815 patterns. Thus the 1804 to 1812 pattern was the one with the lozenge and was carried for about eight years, longer than any other pattern associated with Napoleon. Previous French military colors in the revolutionary era had very different designs. $URL$ Some flags of Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy also had lozenges. $URL$ As you can see, most military colors in that era did NOT use lozenge patterns and it is possible that only France and French client/puppet states used lozenges in their flags. $URL$ Thus lozenges in flag patterns did have an association with Napoleon. Perhaps Pedro I thought that as a self made and revolutionary emperor he had something in common with Napoleon. Napoleon's lozenge military colors were probably inspired by some Revolutionary era colors. I have seen a lozenge in a picture of the color of the 106th regiment of revolutionary France. $URL$ Pictures of the fight on the Bridge of Arcola done't agree on the design of the flag. Some show a lozenge design. $URL$ $URL$ The 32nd Demi brigade had a lozenge flag in 1794-1796. $URL$ If the Brazilian lozenge is based on the Napoleonic lozenge, it may be ultimately based on the design of the colors of one or more Revolutionary French regiments. 

Sapor II, King of Kings of Iran and of Non Iran, went from literally not existing to monarch in much less than the 9 years that Grant rose from his lowest status to be president, being crowned in the same year he was born - according to legend he was crowned in his mother's womb. Of course Sapor didn't do anything to become monarch. According to Gildas in The Ruin of Britain Maglocunnus the Island Dragon usurped his first throne when in earliest adolescence, and thus in a much shorter time after birth than in the case of Grant. Elagablus usurped the throne of the Roman Empire in a bloody Civil War aged 14, though older family members did most of the planning for him. 

$URL$ Mark Girouard in The Victorian Country House 1979, Introduction, section 8 "The Building of a Country House", page 17, says about Westonbirt: "When building was at its height nearly 300 men were on the payroll. At Bear Wood, in June 1868, no less than 380 men sat down for a banquet given by the owner, John Walter of The Times, to celebrate the roofing-in of the house." Westonbirt House is described on pages 424 to 425 and was built from 1863 to 1870. Bear Wood is described in chapter 20, pages 263-272 and was built from 1865 to 1874. These examples show that even when a large country house took years to slowly build there were sometimes hundreds of workers employed at one time. 

I know that German does. When Francis Joseph became Austrian emperor in 1848, the year of revolutions, there was a joke that the "wir" or "we" in his proclamations stood for Windischgraetz, Jellac, and Radetsky, three generals fighting the rebels. But German is closer to English than French is. The Wikipedia article indicates the royal we is widespread in Europe. $URL$ And here is a discussions that mentions its use in French, Spanish, German: $URL$ And this site says: 

Long story short: Most such stories are exaggerated or pure fiction. But some are true, and such practices no doubt go back before the beginning of the species Homo sapiens. Nobody was ever accused of impaling children and babies or anyone else on swords, spears, pikes, or bayonets until swords, spears, pikes, or bayonets were invented. The first known bayonets were used about 1600. That martinet, General Jean Martinet (killed 1672), introduced bayonets to the French army and they were used in most European armies by the 1660s. The first sword-like weapons date to about 3300 BC while the first true swords date to about 1700 BC in Minoan Crete. Nobody knows when spears were first invented or which species first invented them. Early primates may have observed proboscideans using their tusks to spear enemies and copied them. Pre human primates including Homo heidelbergensis used sharpened wooden spears at least as early as 400,000 BC. Neanderthals made stone spearheads as early as 300,000 BC and fire hardened wooden spears were used as early as 250,000 BC. Homo sapiens began to make spears with stone spearheads about 200,000 BC. Both chimps and orangutans have been observed spearing prey with modified tree branches. Since spears were among the first weapons ever used by humans to hunt they were among the first weapons ever used by humans to fight other humans in inter tribal wars and among the first weapons ever used by humans to massacre defenseless humans. Thus I expect that allegations, both true and false, that people have impaled babies on spears go back to the invention of speech complex enough to express that idea. As for cutting pregnant [w]omen open, no doubt people began slashing other people open with stone knives if they were sharp enough, or with metal daggers and swords as soon as they [w]ere invented. Thus stories about pregnant women being cut open and their babies removed no doubt go back a long, long time. added 04-02-2018. For example, the teenage Japanese monarch Buretsu (reigned c. 498-508) is said to have cut open a pregnant woman to examine her fetus in a book written about 200 years later. Long ago I read an article by Mark Twain in which he mentioned in passing an alleged atrocity during the Minnesota Sioux uprising in 1862, a girl crucified by being pinned to a barn door. Since there have been wooden barn doors for centuries and millennia, no doubt stories, both true and false, have been told about people being attached to barn doors for many centuries. 

Eleanor, the Fair Maid of Brittany (c. 1184-1241) The daughter of Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany and sister of Arthur of Brittany (1187-1203) was the rightful heiress of England, Brittany and other Angevin lands after the mysterious death of her brother, and was imprisoned by King John and by Henry III until her death. Bu there is no record of how King John gained possession of her person, and so no proof that she was technically kidnapped. Duke Bretislav I of Bohemia (1002/05-1055) kidnapped his future wife Judith of Schweinfurt (before 1003-1058) daughter of Margrave Henry of the Nordgau, from the nunnery in Schweinfurt in 1019. Their children included Duke Vratislaus II, who became the first King of Bohemia. Neither of the families was of royal rank, but the original question does not specify royal princesses, and both families were certainly of princely rank. Emperor Lothair I's children included had a daughter and princess who was kidnapped and married in 846 by Giselbert Count of the Maasgau. I believe there are a number of other historical examples I can't think of at the moment. 

Every country in the world has its own history. In Medieval Europe there were hundreds and possibly thousands of small states, most of which were more or less subordinate to larger states that in turn were more or less subordinate to still larger states, and so on. In the later middle ages and modern times rulers of powerful states sought to gain more and more control over their subordinate states and to conquer small states that were not subordinate to them. So after about 500 or 600 years of history the map of Europe is mostly composed of large countries whose members mostly speak the national language and feel like members of the national ethnic group. The large (but not total) coincidence between ethnic groups and national borders is due to the efforts of national governments to convert all members of ethnic groups within their borders to members of the national ethnic group. So the few tiny countries remaining in Europe are the remnants of the large number of former countries that once existed in Europe, the survivors that were not annexed by larger countries. 

$URL$ Thus the original reasons for burial by humans may remain as unproven and mysterious as the reasons why elephants sometimes practice burial. 

The King Arthur of history is basically the Arthur mentioned in the Historia Brittonum written about 830 AD and in the Annales Cambriae written about 975. The HB puts the Twelve Battles of Arthur some time between about 450 and 550 AD, while the AC dates Arthur's victory at Badon in a year corresponding to 516 to 518 and the battle of Camlan where Arthur died in a year corresponding to 537 to 539. Thus they were written about 292 to 438 years after Arthur allegedly died and it is possible that legendary elements have been added to those accounts. In late Roman times most of Roman Britain was divided into city states called civitates based on former British tribes. Each city state had elected magistrates and a council and was divided into districts called pagi. Late Roman Britain had four or five provinces whose governors used various titles and supervised the governments of the civitates. The governors were supervised by the Vicar who ruled the diocese of Britain - government diocese, not a religious one. In Cornwall, in Wales, and between the two walls in the North were British tribes that were not very assimilated to Roman culture and may still have had kings, who no doubt lived more or less peacefully with the local Roman military units and acknowledged the authority of the Emperor just as a number of 19th century Indian tribes lived in peaceful coexistence with local US military units and acknowledged the authority of the Grandfather in Washington. Beyond the Antonine Wall were the Picts, who may not have been culturally British and were often enemies of Roman Britain. The Diocese of Britain was part of the Praetorian Prefecture of the Gauls, which was part of the Western Roman Empire. Post Roman Britain may have continued the Roman system of government and also reverted to Celtic forms of government. Leading men may have made themselves kings of each city state, and each pagus may have had a sub king, thus making maybe more than a hundred sub kings in Britain. So Arthur, who led the kings in battle, was probably at least a sub king in rank. Each province may have been ruled by a second level king, and the whole diocese may have have been ruled by a third level king. Or city states may have continued to elect magistrates, and governors could have been chosen for each province, and a vicar to rule all the diocese. And maybe the vicar claimed to be loyal to the Roman prefect of Gaul and to the emperor. Or maybe the ruler of Britain claimed to be an emperor, a sort of north western Roman Emperor. Or maybe the rulers of Britain used both Celtic and Roman titles simultaneously, the ruler of a city state claiming to be both a king and magistrate, and the ruler of a province claiming to be both a second level king and a governor, and so on. Because there were several provinces in late Roman Britain, Britain was referred to as the Britains politically. Thus the vicar used the title of Vicar of the Britains. And so presumably in Arthur's era the overlord of all post Roman Britain would claim to be king, or vicar, or emperor, or whatever, of the Britains, not of Britain, and not of the Britons, though the title of King of the Britons is used in medieval sources. The story of the sword in the stone is first mentioned by Robert de Boron in Merlin around 1200 AD. That is about 700 years after the time of Arthur. $URL$ And so the Sword in the Stone is considered fictional. 

Chinese junks allegedly sometimes grew plants aboard that may have provided part of the diet of their crews. Avoiding the Die straits: An Inquiry into Food Provisioning and Scurvy in the Maritime and Military History of China and wider East Asia Mathieu Torck, Pages 132-134, 146, 150 $URL$ A description of the super ship Syracusa of the third century BC includes: 

$URL$ Mary's younger sister Anne (1665-1714) became queen regnant in 1702. Anne married Prince George of Denmark (1653-1708) in 1683. George was created Duke of Cumberland, Earl of Kendal, and Baron of Okingham in 1689. When Anne was queen she wanted to ask parliament to make George king consort, but the Duke of Marlborough persuaded her not to. Queen Victoria (1819-1901) of the United Kingdom married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1819-1861) in 1840. Victoria wanted to make Albert King consort but because of opposition she made him Prince consort of the United Kingdom in 1857. Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom (born 1924) married Prince Philip (born 1921) of Greece and Denmark in 1947. Philip abandoned his foreign titles and was created Baron Greenwich, Earl of Merioneth, and Duke of Edinburgh in 1947 and was made a prince of the United Kingdom in 1957. So in the United Kingdom and the former kingdoms within it husbands of queens regnant were sometimes made kings consort in the 16th, but not in the 18th, 19th, or 20th centuries. 

There is a book The Structure of the Ottoman Dynasty Anthony Dolphin Alderson, 1956, 1982 that gives very complete and I hope accurate genealogical information about Ottoman genealogy. Not having access to it, I tried this website: $URL$ It merely says when the sons of Prince Halil were born. Since Wikipedia says that Prince Halil was killed by his brother Murad in 1362, it is possible that his two sons were also killed in 1362. 

$URL$ When Charles V abdicated from his various realms, his brother Ferdinand I, ruler of Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia, became Emperor, having been elected King of The Romans decades earlier. Charles V's son Philip II inherited the Spanish thrones. Ferdinand and his descendants continued to use the title of "King of Hungary" since they continued to be kings of Hungary. As I have already said, Philip II and his descendants never seem to have used the title of "King of Hungary" in Spanish documents even though Philip II was the heir of Emperor Frederick III's hereditary claim to the crown of Hungary. Neither Charles V, Philip II, nor their successors claimed the Kingdom of Hungary in their titles as rulers of the Netherlands. $URL$ But the Kings of Spain used the title of King of Hungary from 1556 to 1711 in their titles as Kings of Sicily and Naples.
