It were 2 strings of my hair inside the sink's hole almost washed down but wrapped around litter others leave. Bathroom... is completely dirty. I hate coming there, but have no other choice. All my proposals are ignored, the company doesn't bother with cleaning. It wasn't a problem while we didn't have company's WCs (and it was also a mess). I do clean after myself. But I'm on a verge of vomitting just thinking of doing it after others. I work in separate, just mine, office room and I clean my desk and stuff every week. Also, after reading SE, I got myself one spare mouse "for guests". Beside the dirtiness, it's a very good company and people. Right now I just can't afford leaving. At least for several months. And I am really pessimistic about it... 

I don't know about European/USA practices, but in Russia the most of available vacancies for juniors are like this one. 1-3 years of work experience, long list of requirements. Personally, I think it's wrong way to find an applicant, but the employers and recruiters think, that this way they can get both experienced and graduates for the same position to choose from. They want to assemble as many of them as they can to select the best. That doesn't necessarily imply you'll encounter all of it at work. It's common for mid-sized or micro companies and usually means you will be wearing many hats. Therefore you shouldn't look at requirements at all. Just send your CV. But, again, it really upsets young job-seekers like you (and me not so long ago). 

I don't see it as any more of an issue than the logos that staffing companies sometimes add to the top of your resume when they reformat it into their style. 

Since it doesn't seem to have been covered yet in the current answers, There is the possibility of the supervisor that you hand it to simply refusing to take it, or discarding it. If you think there's any risk of them "losing" your letter, you may want to take a second copy to Human Resources at your company, with an excuse of that you "thought they might want a copy too". Alternately, as Gnasher suggested in the comments: 

That probably bears the caveat that you'll want to time your letter so that it shows up by your day of resignation and, if you're trying to avoid being removed from your job too early, you'll want to avoid them opening it too early. 

If it were for a longer amount of time, say a few months, I'd include it. As it is, I'd leave it off, and then explain it at the interview ("Actually, no, Foocorp was not most recent job. I did a two week stint with BazInc after that. It ended so quickly that I felt it would be misleading to list them.") Past that, you try to be as honest as possible while emphasizing any positive aspects, the same as anything else in your job history. 

In my company we still use Skype for internal purposes. One client can have many projects and each of them can have one or more chats (sometimes my list can easily contain dozens of them). Even if you turn off notifications, those chats are always going up and down, blinking, making it harder to look for current projects info (another dozens of chats). Usually when you are being assigned to another client, a manager of former project excludes you from chats of their responsibility. The last time I switched projects one of the managers didn't exclude me from his group chats and recently one of those became so annoying I left it and others by myself. A few moments later a manager of one of the most annoying project's chat said that I was rude and said to just turn off the sound and never leave the conversations. I left that project 2 months ago and will never ever come back to it. The manager was one of the many and not a senior one. We have no internal regulations on this regard and I never had such problems before. But now it bothers me if he really was right. Are there any rules of etiquette that apply in my situation? 

Assuming the United States, one aspect of contract work which is nice for the contractor is that the company is required to pay you for the hours you work, even if it goes over the standard number of hours (something which salaried employees may not enjoy depending on their exempt/non-exempt status). The flip side is that the company is not obligated to pay you for hours that you do not work. If your contract does not guarantee you at least forty hours of work in the week, the company may be completely within their rights to simply tell you they have no work for you today. I have had that happen in contracts in the past. 

It's been said that it never hurts to ask. Of course, as with all absolute statements (including this one), there are exceptions. One of the first things to do is to check your paperwork. Did you sign a contract? Did the contract include a date by which you would begin work? If so, check for what stipulations there are for if such a date is not accomplished. Some contract boilerplate includes verbiage on what happens if the start date is pushed out or moved forward and some do not. If you feel it seems logical, ask the company. Perhaps they can start you on your training materials, or have you work on a concept necessary to the project on your own. If they balk, it may be worthy gently indicating that, if they are not willing to stand up to their side of the contract, there is nothing preventing you from pursuing other opportunities. Either way, a contract is a contract, and it applies to both sides. Unfortunately, this may result in having to bring in a lawyer if it's serious enough. If you haven't signed a contract, well, you might be able to argue a verbal contract, but your chances are bad. In that case, congratulations, you are a free agent. You have no obligation to begin work with them, so you can start interviewing again, and I'd honestly recommend that you do so, just in case you can't come to an agreement with them. 

Is it unprofessional? Yes. Should you resign? Don't think so. You can resign, you don't need anyone's acceptance to do it for whatever reason. But you may be not so lucky to find one more company like that. If you eventually resign, don't tell your future employers the real reason behind it. It will damage your chances to get another job greatly. Should you just sit and wait? Totally No. Get up and tell your manager about your situation and make some proposals on how you think it can be solved beneficially to both of you. Ask if you can shift your schedule if it's temporal issue. In many companies managers understand that anything can happen in life and they can help you. But they need to know about when you'll have your piece of work done to plan further. Keep them notified and most of them will be satisfied. BUT you MUST make them know. It seems like your company puts up with it. Hang onto them. If it's just your behavioral problems - your vacation won't change anything. Learn how to get over them. It may impede your carrier and life. Such situations may happen endless times. You'd better learn how to solve them on the fly. P.S. I'm from Russia and a programmer too. FYI If your company has annual vacation plan, they have every right not to let you go on vacation. 

Within the United States, I'm pretty sure that there's no legal aspect to it. I have gotten bitten a few times by applying to a job which a recruiter had submitted me for (in one case, it was two different recruiters and in another, I knew the name of the company because I had the website up, but had no record of the recruiter contacting me, although I found an oblique email indicating that he had, alluding to a phone conversation). Most of the time, it's a mild embarrassment, like claiming to be pivotal on a project when talking to the guy who really headed it, but in one case, I missed out on a job because the owner of the company felt that my actions were unethical. Ultimately, it's largely a courtesy thing. The companies don't want to turn off recruiters from recruiting for them, but it's pretty much a matter of a job-by-job thing. Your safest route is to mention that Recruiter A from Company X had submitted you over two years ago for a different job, but that you found this one on your own. That way, if the company wants to avoid trouble, they can contact that recruiter. But honestly, over two years ago, and for a different job, especially if it's different divisions, there's really no conflict at all. I actually received my latest job that way. The former recruiter was bummed that they hadn't found the opportunity on their own, but accepted that it happened because they hadn't properly been on the ball. 

Office manager saw my hair in basin in WC. It accidentally felt inside and has been partly washed away while I was washing my hands. She contacted me by Skype and asked to clean it in the future. Now I'm confused what to tell her. Circumstances: our company has started to rent an entire floor, so all the WCs there are in their responsibility now. They didn't hire a cleaning company or person and don't plan to. Only office kitchen gets cleaned once a several months. Other office rooms hasn't been cleaned for a year so far. Although I agree we should keep office clean, I feel strong revulsion at being forced to dig into the basins each time I wash hands. There is no equipment or disinfectant liquids to perform such manipulations, not even spare paper (company bought electronic hand drier to save money on that and everything else). I can't stop my hair falling even though I comb it regularly. My responsibility, which is written in office regulations and I agree with, is to keep my desk clean. I don't mind because I'm the only one using it. I'm usually not conflicting person, but this goes overboard in my opinion. I'm planning to disagree with her. The problem is I'm a bit socially awkward, our Office manager tends to be unprofessional with the stuff. She is often rude and talkative while I'm shy and can't find proper words to answer on time. So I haven't been able to come up with some lines besides "Should I clean the carpets too? My hair is also falling while I'm walking, I bring soil from the outside as well". We are somehow on good terms (but not so good to blatantly tell her this). Other women' hair also occurs there (we are just 5 females in IT company beside this manager), they leave coffee/tea and other lumps in basins. But I can't simply approach and ask them "What would you tell her in my situation?", because other employees are arguing aggresively and openly (I can't choose this option) with her or ignoring completely. Am I right thinking like that? What other people do with their falling hair? How to tell her I won't clean the basins in a most professional way? Update. 

There is a potential downside to it, particularly if you put your resume out on a job site or farm it out into recruiters. Much like listing your phone number or email address, it gives people (possibly people well removed from those you originally submitted this to) the ability to contact you at will, and ties your name to that address, often in databases that will last a long time. That said, there are upsides to it. Although, as I commented to @jwenting above, I've never received anything via mail from a company until the offer the letter, and generally not even that these days, there probably are still companies out there that do such things. And, as jwenting points out, it does establish where you live, which may influence hiring decisions. Lastly, you may just run into anal-retentive HR people who insist that there must be an address and reject any resume that doesn't have one. Overall, I'd say it's a wash. The benefits are minor. The downsides are minor. 

Honestly, your best recourse is to tell them exactly that, that you're struggling. Not everyone is suited for every job, and it's better for your supervisor to know that you're struggling than to have them learn much later. Tell them what exactly you've been doing to fathom it, where you feel like you're just not getting it, and ask for their advice. Honestly, sometimes it's just a matter of that you're going about it the wrong way, perhaps that they need to start you on something more basic, and sometimes you're just not going to get it. I had to acknowledge the second when working in speech recognition. I just couldn't get it, and I was much happier once assigned to something else.
