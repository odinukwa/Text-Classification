Yo! This is not your fault. Take a breather. I've read in a few different studies that it's foolishness to have a project with a tight deadline and add more developers in the middle. Why? Because everyone new is going to need someone to monitor their personal learning curve -- exactly like the situation you're in. This logic is like failed cooking logic. You have a recipe that calls for you to bake a chicken for an hour at 250 degrees, but try to get it faster (assuming it'll take a half hour) at 500 degrees. It doesn't work! Soak up what you can, but don't take things personally. It's something you have to grow into and experience as a developer. There may be fallout - and you might cite what I'm sharing with you here as your defense. Next time, you can be more cautious about projects (assuming you have a choice), but right now, you can just do "damage control" based on what I'm sharing with you. 90% of software projects fail. Don't take it personally. 

You've answered your own question. "I apologize. I'm very technically able, but I don't have any intimate domain knowledge with XXYYZZ. To get this going, is it okay if we backtrack a bit so you can explain that to me a little better?" 

You're running very fast based on this assumption here. No one really cares what your name is -- with the exception (I'm sorry to say) of Muslim names. Let your experience be the thing that attracts readers to contact you. That's the whole point of the resume. Since your green card gives you the right to work wherever you please, it doesn't make any sense to make it an issue. Leave it off the resume in lieu of better things to put in the same space. I'm a natural-born citizen; I don't speak with an accent, and during my last job search, every person I contacted asked about my work status. It's not a big deal. Don't make it one. 

I don't know why other answers do not stress it but get legal consultation ASAP. Seriously. You absolutely need to know what can you expect and how to react with respect to your localization. The thing is that everyone says that law is on your side. Yes it is, but you cannot do anything unless you can prove that your employer does anything unlawful. The only thing that happened was expressing unprovable intent. The problem is you won't have a proof until your paycheck comes. This is plenty of time. Your employer seems malicious. They probably are not so stupid to do something so plainly illegal, but I wouldn't be too surprised if they went onto setting you up to cover their imagined damages. They might for example get you into violating some internal rules that would result in a lawful deduction. This is really not as simple as "law is on your side". Law is not simple. Of course something blatant as refusing to pay is illegal, but there are plenty other ways to screw the employee. Only a specialist knowing local law and practices will be able to prepare you against what might happen. E.g. how to document your management behaviour and your work, so that you are on the safe side. There probably are some governmental institutions for this, or some friend would know some lawyer who could advise you for typical stuff, or provide a contact. You don't need full-blown court-case service, but some basic advice should be considered mandatory. They will tell you whether or not to tell anything to your boss. It's probably not a good idea to go and tell them "what you are trying to do is illegal", unless you want a practical life lesson. I don't want to scare you, I want to warn you against complacency. It might be a case of a pissed of manager, who blurted something completely irrelevant in the moment, or they are a truly malicious employer. However in the worse case, you will not figure it out until it's too late to react. The actions of your management appear to be completely unreasonable, i.e. expecting a junior staff to do their work properly at full efficiency, and not monitoring nor reacting properly. 

Since day 1 in this company, I felt something was wrong. Maybe I am not the only one who felt this, since some manager spent a week only and left. Anyway, the problem I am facing is that I was assigned two tasks related to two technologies I don't have any idea about. Instead of hiring specially skilled people on this area, they chose to convert developers with technical potential to work on these. They didn't provide any training, and they prioritised a task (the easy one) over another of, and suddenly, without prior notice, they interrupted some meetings and rushed me to start producing in this technology I know nothing of. Naturally, I responded that I can't do much and it's going to be a total failure. they shouldn't throw responsibility on a subordinate in such a chaotic way. The escalation reached management, and all they did is to give me phone calls and tell me "talk to person 1, so that they talk to person 2, so that they talk to person 3, just try, just do whatever you can do ...". Since the beginning of this new job in this project, I kind of foresaw this outcome, but I didn't really have a choice, and I wasn't sure yet, so I dove in. All I can this of right now is that whether they secure the contract with the client or not, they will fire me, and that's how it felt. My gut tells me that it's too much for mismanagement - they can't fail that way unless it's on purpose. Am I wrong? 

Before I leave my previous job, my ex-boss told me that I could call him at any time. I am not very thrilled about my new job, so I contacted him and he seems willing to hire me back, except that he won't propose anything better (I will work in the same conditions + I shouldn't leave again, at least not very quickly). It's obvious for me right now that I won't accept his offer, especially after a short interview we had this week. He said he will have to convince departments to accept me back, especially that there was some Veto when I was hired the previous time. It looks like he is working on preparing my comeback. Should I anticipate and tell my ex-boss I am not interested anymore? Or should I wait for his call and then tell him? 

You should try to get it diagnosed. It looks like you have been stressing out, maybe even without realizing it. But it might be physiological as well. E.g. hormone imbalance might manifest as mood swings. Once you have it figured out you can think how to alleviate it. Even if it is "just" stress. I also don't think you should keep it separate from work, if it's induced by work that is impossible. Everyone has a bad day occasionally and many managers are fine with it. Programming is usually a creative job, and it's normal to have variable productivity. However, being permanently stressed by job also needs addressing at the job. A little back story: I didn't go for professional help but I was new and having trouble keeping up deadlines (I didn't need to keep) worked for 12h a day to the point of feeling physically unwell. And trust me, I am by many touted as the most laid-back person they know. The pressure got to me, and I didn't get the help needed team-wise. My teams' modus operandi was to have more tasks than fits the schedule and just push the ones that didn't make the release, but I couldn't adjust to this, I've constantly felt under-performing even after getting "meets all expectations" eval two years straight. I didn't feel like it, and the pressure I've felt was mostly subconcious and self-induced This is addressable by a manager, and almost all job-induced stress is. I've changed a team (within the company) and I think it's fitting me better. There are many other ways, like hobby, or not giving too much crap, but you have to have the root cause figured out 1st. (I made the decision before talking about it with my previous manager because I didn't want to expose myself, in case no remedy could be found.)
