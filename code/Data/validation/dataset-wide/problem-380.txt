Rich Bob Bob, assuming he has a modicum of curiosity and drive, is going to become hilariously rich. Once he gets his first "good spawn", he picks a trade and does that for his life. Pays well enough, and there's few places in the world that someone who's handy with tools isn't going to do reasonably well (especially if they can become "naturally gifted" as a youth). (Military service would also be a good skillset to pick up early) After that, on a bad spawn he relies on his existing skills, on a good spawn he picks up new skills to help in later lives. Wealth transfer is a small problem, but that entirely depends on what you're planning to do. Given that after a few gos you're likely to be fluent in multiple languages, have skills (and presumably maturity) far beyond your age? You're likely to never be working McDonald's - even if you end up in the poorer parts of the world, I'd put good odds on you managing to make a life for yourself. On the other hand, if you've racked up a solid nest egg? Numbered bank account would be a good way to forward funds to your next life (I'm not 100% on the details, but a quick Google seems to suggest that once the account is set up that only the password is required to access it - perfect when you're not going to quite be yourself when it's time to withdraw, y'know?) If you're willing to let other people into the secret, you also have some options regarding trusts or other financial shenanigans. That seems in "exercise for the reader" territory, though. Problems (or at least assumptions) Having your memories doesn't necessarily guarantee that you have complete memories. So it's entirely possible that you're going to start forgetting things that you-a-few-generations learned. We're also assuming that Bob here is reasonably bright, and able to learn and retain many things given time. If you're in a situation where you don't have the opportunity to use a skill, you're very likely to lose it. The government (or other "shadowy conspiracy") angle is interesting. If you know that Bob respawns, presuming that you know when he dies and sufficient resources, you might actually be able to track down the two-year old respawn version. In that case, life might be a lot easier, since your followers/masters will presumably pick you up in the BobJet and take you back to the BobMansion (with varying amounts of shenanigans to make you a legal citizen, give you an identity, etc etc.) An interesting side question of this is "why?" - other than being a living historian, you're not particularly valuable. Best I can think of is that you-as-respawner are considered valuable, like the Dali Llama or similar - but then you aren't rich or possibly terribly powerful either. 

You would prove it by showing that it's not magical activity. You point out that since psionics is a secret, that they don't know what they're looking for. But they do know that magic exists, and the way you phrased your question implies they have the ability to detect magic (they just can't use it to detect psionics because it's the wrong "frequency"). So, I'm investigating something "weird". No natural explanations come to mind. I cast my detection spells, come up blank. So, how did it get done? At this point, it's time to quote Moscow Rules: Once is an accident. Twice is coincidence. Three times is an enemy action. At some point, your magicians are going to suspect, then realize, that there's another power at work. Whether this ends with them finding a way to detect your psions, or just the secret service tracking down the person who just happens to be in the neighborhood at the wrong time every time, depends on the story. 

I'm going to assume that you can handwave the structural aspects (meaning, we're going to decide how big this place needs to be to meet goals, and then Science! will figure out how to make it hold together), so let's tackle the obvious: how much space do you need to maintain 200 million people? First link I found was this infographic regarding how much space you would need to feed yourself. It works out to two acres per person. We're going to handwave a bit and assume that you can save some space with the hydroponics and such, but that you're also going to want parks and offices and the like, and that those two items will balance out - so that our living-and-eating space number is 2 acres per person. You list 200 million people, so at 2 acres per person, that's 400 million acres, or roughly 1.6 million square kilometers. If this was flat, you'd be looking at something the size of Mongolia or Iran (just to give you a comparison). Since we're constructing this, we can make a nice geometric shape. A square would be 1200km to the side. If you prefer a circle, it's about 1400km edge to edge. (For reference, the longest supertanker built to date is a touch over 450m long). Now, you do have some room to wiggle by building up, but I think the takeaway is: you're going to build something at this scale, "floating" might not be the right strategy - you're large enough that it very easily could be simpler to just find some reasonably shallow water and just build your own island. Something this big isn't going to move under it's own power, so might as well park the sucker and be done with it (also, that lets you handwave a lot of the heavy machinery you've got planned) So, next step - power generation. You are going to need a lot. And since you're building a reasonably small space, I'd say you'd have better luck using the UK number over the US one (it's almost half). But you're going to want every source you can find. Solar is probably the most problematic, since roofing over your city means you'll be spending power lighting everything underneath. But wind, tidal (you're out on the ocean, right?), and nuclear is probably your best bet. I'm skipping some numbers here because I'm not sure I crunched them right, but it looked like you were going to need a lot of juice. Like, many large reactors worth. So this is another good place to handwave advancement in technology. Now, just those two issues is going to make this an... interesting project to say the least. But I think where you're going to run into the biggest trouble is your plan to do manufacturing. In addition to the general power, space, and pollution requirements that most manufacturing involves, having to ship everything to and from can't help the bottom line. So, let's take a moment to ask: Why would a megacorp spend such a crazy amount of cash to build what is really a large nation (complete with new landmass) out in the ocean? The only thing I can think of is a space elevator - those like being out in the middle of nowhere, it's something fancy (and in itself expensive) enough to justify the overall expense, and now you're not a manufacturer, you're an import/exporter (specifically, the only cheap way to and from orbit). If this corp plays it's cards right, the various nations will keep each other away from you (since no-one wants to lose access). 

I think the question makes an important and possibly flawed assumption: that what NORAD tracks is actually Santa. Think about it - given the speeds he's travelling, it's a safe bet that no-one has ever made a visual confirmation, much less managed to force the Fat Man down for customs inspections. So, the answer could be simply that "NORAD has never tracked Santa, but it suits his purposes to let them think they are." 

Add an external source of energy that's channeled by "flashy" moves. For real life, there's two main reasons you don't see big flashy moves - they leave you open for counterattack (meaning someone who is just trying to win will shank you while you're setting up), and they take more energy for the same (or less!) effect. (As a Vampire Slayer put it best: what's powering that kick, raw enthusiasm?) So, as a fighter who is busy trying not to die, there needs to be an advantage to the extra flailing - and specifically, an advantage to combat. And that means there needs to be some additional energy coming into the equation that makes the swing extra-strong or fast or whatevs. Now, you could flavor this as generic superheroism, or as a ki power (Mortal Kombat or the classic "your kung-fu is weak"), or as magic (Airbending). But the key point is that doing this makes you fight better. 

An example you could run with is a Wild West town - the "law" is either non-existent, or is just a guy with a gun and a badge instead of just the gun. There might be "laws", but they're only enforced if you can take out the crook - if you have enough influence and enough guns, you can do what you like. Money will work like money always does - as a medium between commodities. (Unless people start trading chickens for bullets, you'll always have some sort of currency). But that's not your problem. The problem is how do people run their businesses if there's crazy people with weapons running amok? Everyone will be armed, because you're in a might-is-right scenario. Someone might avenge your death, but that don't help you stay alive. Houses and stores (which will probably be in the same structure) will be built to be defended. An example is a turn-of-the-century Western bank, where the teller lives upstairs with a shotgun, and there's a grill in his floor that he can stick a shotgun through, pointing directly in front of the safe. Now, in practical terms, people are going to start banding together for safety and support and strength, which is where your gangs come in. If the gangs can't get along, you don't really have a town - you have several walled compounds that happen to be very close to each other. If they're on speaking terms (in the "it's not worth our time to shoot each other on sight" sense), you really are a lot closer to feudalism - it's just a bunch of gang leaders instead of a bunch of nobles in charge. 

Arrest them. I mean, seriously - this project is already so far into black-ops land (as others have noted, you've just built ten secret interplanetary spacecraft!), so why are we suddenly worried about approval? You show up, you take them into custody (pick a crime; since you have lead time you can probably dig up a Facebook post that can justify it), and you take them to the launch site. What do they bring? Nothing. Tools? Bah - you can have those workbenches fully stocked months in advance. Research notes? Just pull all the hard drives on your way out, let 'em organize themselves mid-flight. If you're softie enough to be bringing kids at all, then let your MIBs be softies and let them grab a toy or two on their way out the door. But everything else? Pre-stocked on the ship. (You secretly built ten rocketships - it's almost insulting to suggest you don't know their measurements). After that, it's simple - you drive everyone in, you put them on the rocket, and you launch the moment the last person is onboard. By the time someone is in a position to complain, you're in orbit watching the apocolypse happen, and then your mission commander can be as apologetic as they like. (And when you just saved their lives, it's a bit harder to be cranky about due process.)
