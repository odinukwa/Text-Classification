No matter where it originated, the virus travels by air, and faster than people. It will infect the entire landmass, maybe the entire world, within a very short delay. Being infected makes no difference whatsoever before you die, but when you die no matter the cause you will turn into a zombie within 24 hours, sometimes much faster. Any zombie bite will kill you within hours. There is no known cure to either being alive and infected, or full blown zombie. 

Let's assume that the people responsible for the original outbreak were both prepared and responsible. They reacted fast enough, either by alerting or being the autorities, so that everyone got the information quickly enough to avoid a complete disaster like in TWD. They couldn't prevent the infection, but zombies didn't take control of the country or world, not even a city. After that, since everyone turns into zombies on death, but it won't take you by surprise, I guess zombies will become a notable risk in society. How would society adapt to this new zombie element added to regular deaths? I assume funerals would be very different, considering that even by killing the zombie, you'd still have a much more disgusting corpse, therefore open caskets would probably disapear. I am asking specifically what measures could a country take, whether it is by law or by religion, to avoid mass murders every time someone dies? What habits would people adopt to react to this important change from a safety point of view? Is it even possible to avoid complete anihilation, assuming we know what we're dealing with from the start? 

Let's start by hand-waving all the physics problems like friction, momentum, etc. We can use a made-up term that is totally original and not inspired by other fictional speedsters. VelocityStrength or something along those lines. So assuming that VS takes care of all the (billions) little problems that come from such a speedster, like breaking keyboards, running out of air and completely destroying everything around from extreme air pressure changes, now our speedster, let's call him Barney Warren, has several things to take care of. Since the mechanics of this speedster as a baby are ridiculous, and you didn't specify if the power is natural or obtained later, I will only take into account adult life. I will aslo assume that this speedster ages in real time, and not in subjective time, because otherwise they'd die of old age within hours. Time factor: 1 subjective hour = 86400 real hours Until Barney succeeds at communication, nobody knows he exists. Unless he is willing to stand still for days (one day = one second), nobody will ever see him. Any sound he makes would be far too high-pitched to be heard by humans or animals, and any physical contact would either instantly destroy the target, or be protected by VS and do basically nothing. The speedster then needs to change something in the environment to communicate. Writing messages is obvious, whether it is on paper, in the sand, by email, etc. But if he wants the communication to be two-sided, he needs to be incredibly patient. What is the most likely to happen, provided this speedster is a good guy, is that he will steal a lot, but people will like it. If he is a villain, we'd all be conquered or killed within a day. Just like everyone else, he has needs. As for food and water, his needs are probably roughyl equal to 86400 people for the same timespan. That's a LOT of ressources, and he has to obtain them without people's consent, because he'd die of hunger before anyone could say yes (at least until he establishes a decent rotation, like ask 100 000 people and pay them, then come back to the first to collect after he gave consent, etc) I think the most logical course of action is to go do jobs hat are time sensitive, and steal the pay (while leaving a written explanation). Barney finds some place where people are doing physical work. He then uses his near-infinite time to figure out how much the owners are paying, calculates the total (hourly pay * number of workers * time to completion), then does the entire thing instantly (from our perspective) and steals this precise amount of money. While technically illegal, I'm pretty sure paying the same amount to get the work done instantly instead of over months would leave many owners very happy. Then he can "buy" things the same way. Steal what you need, figure out the price, leave the correct aount of money with a post-it on it explaining exactly what you did. Some people literally do the same in gas stations if the clerk is busy and they are in a hurry, but in seconds instead of milliseconds. Considering the incredibly rate at which Barney would do those operations, pretty much everyone would be aware of him instantly. After a very short time, some people would start making official offers to him (X amount of money/food/etc if you come do this for me), which would take into account the incredibly fast work, and would probably pay more. Not everyone would like it. Barney would be "stealing" many more jobs than any illegal alien ever did. But I assume that by catching bad guys or saving lives every now and then, Barney could keep a relatively nice reputation and be liked overall. As for personal connexions, it's just impossible. Long distance relationships have a much lower rate of success because distance, and delay in communications, are a huge burden on relationships. Imagine a guy who would have to wait months at a time even for the simplest answer to a question? I'm sorry to say, Barney will never be friends with Risco and Katelyn. As for my personal opinion, while he might not turn into a total villain, he will definitely not stay that nice for long. Nobody can stop, threaten or even lecture him. Sooner or later, he will start to work less and/or take more, and at some point will straight up just take. Nobody is holding him accountable anyway, and physical work will get boring/tiring extremely fast, especially alone. Keep in mind that while the work is done within minutes, Barney had to do maybe months or years of work, on what probably looks like a normal person's Schedule (8-12hours a day), without any help, teamwork or person bringing refrreshments. And as opposed to us, he can't look forward to being done after a quick 45 years. 

In my world, there has been a zombie apocalypse at some point in the past. Humanity got hit hard by it, and the number of humans has been reduced to a few thousands when it happened. Humanity managed to actually win against the zombies over time, since there was a huge but limited number of them, and they are pretty dumb. Now the human population is back within the millions (it's been decades, maybe even centuries, I haven't decided yet). We are rebuilding civilization slowly but surely. Obviously, zombies didn't fight among themselves or eat each other (that would make any sort of horde impossible, therefore making them no dangerous at all). They aren't particularly interested in eating brains, but do love eating humans. They would probably eat other animals in they managed to grab them. Only humans can be turned into zombies. They act basically like in The Walking Dead as for moving slowly, going after survivors by sound, sight and smell, but you need to have had contact with a zombie (bite, scratch, etc) to turn into one. You don't turn if you die from other causes, but your dead body can be turned later on if it gets scratched or bitten. Now from a realistic perspective, even though they are technically dead already, zombies move. They need bones, muscles and energy to do so, even if they are almost brain dead, and don't seem to feel pain or bleed out from cut limbs. A human that gets turned probably has calories to keep moving for a few days, maybe weeks if he has lots of fat. Catching something and eating it will obviously result in a calorie intake (they can diggest you assuming they still have the necessary organs, and this can probably be handwaved if they don't). Let's say that zombies show up on day 1, and reduce the world population through kills and turning them into zombies to a few thousands within 5 years. How long can I expect zombies to stick around after that, assuming humans are now well organized and almost nobody gets turned anymore? I'm looking for the very maximum length of time that there could still be a few zombies around, and what exactly did those outlier zombies do in order to last that long. For example, if the majority of zombies died within 1 year, almost all of them are dead after 3 years, and maybe a few dozen of them can still be found after 5 years. What did those last ones do differently to last so much longer? Did they happen to be in a specific location, or were "asleep", etc. Where did they find the energy to live so much longer, and of course having an idea of how long this would be is good, but that's not the main question. In this context, I want to set my story up so that everyone knows about the zombie apocalypse, but do not expect to find zombies anymore, but end up finding one or a few of them at some point, which take them completely by surprise (unexpected), but is still possible.
