You might have a fast metabolism but it would be very useful if you shared an example of your daily intake so we can see how much and what you eat. You should eat a lot of proteins and the right ammount of carbs and have enough sleep (at least 8 hours a day) in order to gain quality weight. When I started to train I went to the gym 4 times a week, each time exercising 2 muscle groups and abs and used the following diet: Morning: 3 egg whites 1 cup of cereals with low-fat milk Snack: sanwich with integral bread and turkey ham low-fat yogurt Lunch: pasta or rice 300g of meat (turkey, chicken, horse or fish) vegetables Snack: 2 apples Dinner: 300g of meat vegetables If you are a healthy person, eat the right ammount of quality food, exercise well and sleep enough sooner or later you will get the right results. Many people complain about not being able to gain weight but in most cases it is not because of metabolism or health issues but the matter of incorrect daily habits. Hope it helps! 

During two quite active weeks, I lost about three kilos. After those weeks, I have been feeling low on energy, and more affected by how much food I have eaten the last few hours than before. In other words, in the past I could go without food for hours without feeling like I was low on energy. After the two aforementioned weeks, I can no longer do that. Is this normal? I have to add that I am about 180 cm tall and now weigh 87 kilos. So, I am definitely not underweight. 

If you have a condition which does not allow you to have a too low glucose level, how can you lower your fat percentage? Can I do that by gaining more muscle? (I.e. since my body will be consuming more calories, will my body weight stabilize at a lower number with the same blood glucose level?) 

I have better experience with aerobic exercises than anaerobic (ie unlike most other people). Even in regards to strength. Weightlifting never helped me; I peaked at some low point, and I stayed there. However, after some aerobic exercises, my max strength reached a relatively high level. So, I am quite satisfied with my back strength due to a rowing machine. Skipping rope helped a lot with my calves. However, I have never been able to build up my chest significantly. Pushups have helped somewhat, but I feel even that may be a little too heavy (compared to what have helped other muscle groups). I am not writing this to start an aerobic vs anaerobic discussion; I have had enough of those. Rather, I am looking for something of an equivalent to a rowing machine for the chest. I want suggestions for how I can train my chest aerobically. 

There willpower is strong that they never strive for delicious food? How they workout being on such strenuous diet, without getting faint, or fall on floor unconscious while shooting? Or it is just a myth, pictures, videos are only a camera trick? 

I have been reading at various websites on internet and on YouTube, people generally that you are neutralizing whatever you are doing because you are mixing it counter exercise. Is this really true? E.g.1 Chest and Abs exercise shouldnâ€™t be same day. Like 1 set of bench press followed by 1 set of oblique crunches, might sound silly (just for example sake) E.g.2 Running first then workout or first workout then running or doesnt matter. 

But when I run on treadmill I can easily run for continuous 15 mins at 1 level up incline. Does this still shows that I have high cholesterol levels in body? I am 31 years old, I am not skinny, I am not heavy build, I am not fat. I weigh 176 pounds. I do running, heavy lifts on 'n' off, not regular basis. 

When I was younger, I was always given some training plan where I had to do, lets say, as an example, 3x8 bench presses. Also, another rule was that if I could only do this with 70kg, I could not do 75kg 3x6 to build up to eventually being able to do 3x8 bench presses with 75kg. I was never able to get any results from this. In the example above, I would be stuck with 70kg 3x8 bench presses for months, and then just give up because I was not making any progress. With other heavy lifting, like pull ups, the advice is quite different; If you cannot do one, do a half. In this case, I was able to make progress. I can now do five pull ups. This makes me suspect that I should have been allowed to build up to lifting more weight. Any time I have made progress have been when I ignored the "lift as much weight as you can lift nxm times". Most training plans online also involve doing an exercise nxm times. The question I have is, how do you make progress? Are you supposed to lift x kilos until you can lift x+y kilos the same number of times as you could lift x kilos previously?
