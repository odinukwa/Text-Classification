Body weight movements will allow you to build some initial strength at your own pace. Additionally, you should look to incorporate some form of stretching to improve flexibility. Once you feel you've made sufficient improvements, you should consider some type of formal resistance training. 

If you’ve got steps in your house/apartment, you can duplicate those exercises easily. In fact, stairs can be used for a variety of exercises. For starters, try Stair Tricep Dips with Triceps press on the stairs. You can substitute step ups on the stairs for your leg work. Additionally, if you can get a hold of an exercise ball, or, aerobic step, those make good substitutes for chairs also. 

Stretch marks are a “tearing” of the layers of the skin (dermis). As you’ve already figured out, they’re usually the result of a rapid expansion of the skin surface and can have many causes. Unfortunately, since each of us is an individual, there’s no standard “rule” as to how much weight the body can add without resulting in stretch marks. Logic would, however, dictate that to avoid them you should try to gain weight gradually over an extended period so that your body can adapt and adjust to a larger skin surface. 

Your request is overly simplistic. That’s why you haven’t been able to find any reliable information. It’s difficult to develop the correlation you want because each of us is an individual capable of losing weight at our own individual pace. Having said that, it is still possible to lose the weight. You’ll need to set a realistic goal, and, expend more calories than you consume. That may mean adding more walking, or, bodyweight exercises to your regime. Additionally, I would suggest you write down the foods you are consuming to get a better idea of what your caloric intake is. It’s hard to know how much calories to cut if you don’t know what you are consuming. Start by keeping a nutrition diary. Some things just don't fit into a nice neat formula. 

Your ability to obtain “six pack abs” is going to be limited by a few factors, some in your control, and, others you can’t control. 

And, since you’ve indicated that wearing shoes and swimming are not possible at the moment, using a rower barefooted seems like a possibility. In an earlier post (How to Develop Cardio with a Broken Toe), Livestromg.com again comments: 

I’m biased, but, if you have access to one, I would urge you to take a look at using a rower for a full body workout. Done with correct form, you can get an entire workout experience from strength to aerobics. You can train for endurance, intensity, etc. Most good rowing machines come with a performance monitor so you can track your progress. 

While you may be able to perform some of these exercises on your own, it’s probably best that you work with a physical therapist to insure proper exercise form and follow up. Failure to do so, may result in a chronic condition. 

Carbohydrates have gotten a "bad rap" in the last several years. For every article or non-standard diet that demonizes carbohydrates, you'll find an equal number that doesn't. Notice the discrepancy with the first answer posted here. 

It concluded that more significant research needs to be done to further quantify any benefit from stretching. In my opinion, since there does not appear to be any detrimental effect from stretching after a workout, I'll continue to stretch as part of my post training sessions. Lastly, if you're interested in learning more about asymmetry, I'd suggest you take a look at Anatomy And Physiology: Human Body Becomes Asymmetrical After Embryo Develops Differences , a short Ted Talk that does a nice job explaining asymmetry. 

Actually, you should do both types of training without expecting to spot reduce. You can't direct your body to draw fat from a specific location for energy. Losing weight healthfully takes time. If what you tried has not been working, mix things up. Add some weight training to your workouts. The idea is to try and burn more calories than you consume, while keeping in mind, you're in it for the "long haul". I'd also take a closer look at the food log you mentioned and possibly cut some calories. 

This question, as worded, is off-topic. But, since I've written such a program in the past, I'll point you to what I used. The USDA maintains a Nurtient Database that can be downloaded. If memory serves me, it's large and is distributed in several parts. There is documentation to help you decipher each part of the download. 

It can occur to any finger on your hand. It’s the result of an inflammation of the tendon that moves the finger. When it’s inflamed, the tendon cannot move freely through the sheath that surrounds it. This typically results in the finger feeling like it “catches”. In my experience (I’ve actually had this condition), there are two recourses. Rest and/or a shot of cortisone to calm the tendon. In any event, you should consider giving the affected hand a chance to rest. 

One “unorthodox” exercise that has somewhat fallen out of favor is the Zottman Curl. And, it’s a shame because it works both the biceps and the forearms. You’ll be able to spot a former bodybuilder because he’s the one still doing Zottman curls. 

While it's good that you've decided to exercise with weights, the real answer to your question can only be found in the amount of effort you expend while you perform each movement. Some would argue that the distraction of the tv would reduce your effort, and, there's probably some truth to that. While others will say that at least you're doing some physical activity. I, personally, find using a tv as a distraction while performing aerobics (rowing) helps keep my mind off the pain and effort I feel when pushing myself for more gains. But, at the same time, I fully understand that the tv is for "background noise" and not to be used to grab my attention. In the end, you're the only one that can decide whether watching tv and exercising is of any value to you. 

You make no mention of your goal. So, let's assume that it's one that's shared by many people: a balanced, symmetrical, and aesthetic physique. Working only arms will not accomplish that since you are neglecting other body parts. In a sense, if you were an artist, you're painting a small portion of the picture and leaving the rest unfinished. Additionally, while you may get bigger arms, and that's not a given, your potential for an overuse injury increases. And, having an unbalanced physique may put more demands on the other body parts that you have neglected. All in all, working only one body part is never a good idea.
