The Giant's Drink, especially, seems to be somehow important, but I can't figure out why. On one level, it's obviously a tool that Card uses to develop Ender's character (and ability to think laterally), but it seems to me (when I read the book years ago, and still today) that the dilemma, and Ender's solution, must have some other symbolic meaning, besides. What is the symbolism of the Mind Game, and the various areas and activities therein (especially the Giant's Drink)? 

Marethyu is a central character in The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel. You can read more about him here, but that Wikia page contains major spoilers for the series, so follow that link at your own peril. Marethyu is, among other things, Death: 

Elend's last, defining act was one of war -- something linked to Ruin. More important, though, is his ability to accept that his ability and responsibility to commit violence was not a contradiction to who he was as a gentleman and a scholar. His final reconciliation of the different facets of his personality is mentioned in chapter 67: 

In Mark Dunn's "progressively lipogrammatic epistolary fable" Ella Minnow Pea, the populace of a small island are forbidden the use of certain letters of the English alphabet in speech and writing as they fall off of a sign. The story develops as characters write letters to each other. In one letter, dated "Topsy Turvy, Octavia 19" (Thursday, October 19 -- at this point, the letters "D" and "B" are forbidden) and addressed to Nate, Tassie includes a postscript: 

I think that this color scheme reflects a larger theme in the book (and, indeed, the series); namely, that of realizing and accepting that one's identity can have more than one part to it. The colors, then, are clues to the characters' initial states. Let me explain. 1: Ruin and Preservation One idea that is present throughout the series is that Ruin and Preservation don't stack up as good and evil -- they're more about Ruin and Preservation (see, for example, the quote in the question post). They're opposites; where one exists, the other cannot. Where one acts, the actions of the other are canceled. It appears that these two forces are irreconcilably opposed. However, by the end of the story, Sazed takes up both of the powers, and becomes Harmony. This, of course, wouldn't work very well if Ruin were evil. These things are powers, and they only appear to be contradictory; Sazed's ascension proves that they are, in fact, compatible. This is the most subtle, yet perhaps most significant expression of this theme in the series. 2: Vin and Elend Throughout the entire series, both Vin and Elend struggle to understand the different parts of their personalities and identity, before ultimately realizing that they are, indeed, able to integrate the different facets of their identities into a cohesive whole. Vin has a short conversation with Elend about their struggles (at their first ball in The Hero of Ages, in chapter 32): 

Here are some excerpts from Azar Nafisi's introduction to a new edition of the novel (published, and slightly edited, on The Guardian's website, 5/13/2006) that may indicate why it was banned by the Iranian government. In brief, it criticized the state of society and government in Iran at the time, and also talked about "love and eroticism" in a way that many puritanical Muslims might object to. 

This is followed immediately by the chorus: "So take me back..." I interpret this as a hope or prayer that the singer can go back to a simpler time, so that he and the listener will be on the same level again. (He does not ask that the listener gain negative life experiences.) I don't think that "thief" is a good example of someone who has that earlier and lighter frame of mind that the speaker wishes to return to. The thief may be unafraid, but that mindset is probably not the solution that the speaker seeks from the "darkest place that you could be." So, why use the word "thief" in "Thief"? 

For more information on the reasons for book censorship in Iran, see these Wikipedia articles and "Criteria for banned books in Iran."* 

However, by the end of chapter 20, something has already changed. A female acquaintance of his, MeLaan, visits him in his cell. She exhorts him to fight, to rebel against the governing body of the kandra people. He responds that he would not, but then begins manipulating his captors into affording him the opportunity of escape by mentioning that his dog's body was humiliating and disgraceful to him. This ensures that when he is taken for his execution (ch 33) he has a body that is significantly faster than his captors', allowing him to outrun them and escape successfully. So whatever change occurred, it must have happened somewhere between the beginning and the end of the 20th chapter. Something happens, or TenSoon reaches some conclusion, that changes him from the "no, I would never try to escape even if it were possible" kandra that he was, to a "less orthodox" (his words) and rebellious kandra who takes steps to create and utilize a way out of his lawful (if somewhat unjust) execution. However, I think I missed it, whatever it was. What caused this sudden and striking change in TenSoon's character? I understand that this change serves to emphasize the kandras' utter surprise when TenSoon begins his escape (as well as some mild surprise for the readership), but a change this dramatic should be caused by something. TenSoon has lived approximately 700 years, and humans 1/20th of his age don't change like that without strong cause. 

I think that it is unclear. (SparkNotes concurs.) My feeling is that O'Brien's statement is honest (and not a calculated lie) because of the followup: 

I recently started reading Sam Logan's Sam and Fuzzy online, and am greatly enjoying it. In the fifth volume of the NMS Series (Sam and Fuzzy Missing Inaction, "Boundaries, Pt. 9") there's a cute scene where Sam references the Hokey Pokey, and two other characters finish the traditional verse. 

"unnecessary in some instances of patriotic behaviour" does not mean that this element is vulnerable to an attack; it means that it is not always needed. Next! "will call for various acts of national sacrifice." This option can be a little confusing, because it might mean that it leaves patriots vulnerable to put themselves in danger, to sacrifice themselves for a national benefit. However, on further thought, this describes a vulnerability in the patriot, and not in the belief of patriotism. "has no historical basis yet it is important" does not (only) describe a way that this part of the belief is vulnerable. This statement made me think a bit, because it does kind of present a vulnerability -- that there is no historical basis for this element of patriotism. However, the second part of this statement, "yet it is important," is not something that is part of the definition of "open to attack." "cannot* be justified on rational grounds" is a major vulnerability in patriotism. If it cannot rationally answer questions about it, then it can be described as "open to attack" from those rational questions. 

Zombies are also found elsewhere in Norse mythology; during Ragnar√∂k, the unworthy dead return from Hel to fight the Norse gods (and the Einherjar). I read about this recently in Neil Gaiman's Norse Mythology: 

Is there a reason her eyes are two different colors? It appears from the above passage that it may have something to do with her development from Delight; is one color normally associated with delight, and the other with delirium? The Wikia page says "One of her eyes is blue, and the other is green, though she can adjust them to the same color but says that hurts her," but doesn't mention why (in-universe or out) the eyes are different colors. 

The godly brothers then give the logs first life, then will, intelligence, and drive, and finally shape (one male, one female). Then they give them clothes, for they were cold, and finally they gave them names. 

It makes sense that the woman who makes her bed in the third gable, whose reproductive process is linked to drama, is the "washed-up stage actress." A stereotypical minister's wife would keep a garden, I suppose, so it makes sense that the woman who made her bed in the second gable would produce botanical offspring. I just don't understand why a former nurse would be associated with technology, and children made of metal. I guess it's possible that the women's life-creating powers don't relate to their former occupations, but then those don't really need to be mentioned at all, right? (And that also would contradict the pattern I established above.) Although, to be fair, associating the nurse with the almost-biological process of the woman who made her bed in the first gable cellar does make a certain amount of sense. Another possibility is that the order of former vocations does not match the order of gables. I just think it makes sense to make the list follow that order; besides, if I'm right about the actress and the minister's wife, that means that half of the list does follow that order. But, assuming I'm right in my assumptions about the women and their former jobs, why does the nurse create with metal? 

"Dr. Viktor E. Frankl of Vienna, Psychiatrist of the Search for Meaning, Dies at 92," New York Times Sept. 4, 1997 I originally assumed the manuscript had a different thesis, because I thought that Frankl developed logotherapy after his experiences in the camps. It appears that Frankl was working on logotherapy before he entered the camps. His inclusion of his experiences in the camps was an emphasis of, rather than a history of, his theories. 

Does this description of man as Ash, and woman as Elm, tell us anything about how the ancient Norse people understood gender and the differences between men and women? If the story does tell us something about the ancient Norse views on gender, is there something in the first passage I quoted, about the suitable uses for ash and elm wood, that is relevant to this? The explanation of the differences between the two woods (both are useful, but in different ways) might reveal a similar attitude toward men and women (neither is superior, but they have different roles), or it might only be a practical description of the materials available to the Norse, and nothing else. Is this description of man and woman as Ash and Elm changed in any way from the original Norse myths? (I know there's been some discussion about the accuracy of Gaiman's transmission of the myths, but I haven't yet seen any discussion of particular discrepancies in Norse Mythology.) What, if anything, does it mean that Yggdrasil is an ash tree ("Yggdrasil and the Nine Worlds")? Is Yggdrasil meant to have masculine characteristics? 

I haven't (yet) read the novel in question, but I can explain the passage's simple meaning as a fluent English speaker. Let's take this apart, one piece at a time. 

There was a scientist who tried to make others able to see them by causing threats to their safety, but, if I remember correctly, there was nothing in the book about mescaline. 

I just finished The Alloy of Law by Brandon Sanderson. As is the norm in many of Sanderson's Cosmere books, the story is followed by a short section titled "Ars Arcanum," with a description of some of the various kinds of magic present on that particular world of the Cosmere. (There's a bit about the naming of this section on Sanderson's blog, here.) While lazily skimming that section, I noticed that the final sentences read: 

Was this hook intended to parallel the Grim Reaper's scythe? The personification of Death in many cultures often wields a farm tool with a curved blade. Even Death of the Endless is occasionally shown with a scythe. I've seen many "fan arts" of Marethyu's hook online (as far as I could tell, none official), and most look something like Captain Hook's hook, and not much like a scythe. I don't remember any of the book's descriptions of this hook's appearance, but it has to appear as something that can fit on the end of one's arm, which obviously means that though it is a curved blade, it does not appear exactly as a scythe does. Physical appearance aside, is there any indication from the books that Marethyu/Death's hook is supposed to be a scythe? A trivial Google search didn't turn up anything relevant. 

The second volume of The Sandman tells the story of Rose Walker and her relationship with Dream as the vortex of the modern era. While I was reading the volume, I was initially confused about how the prologue (#9 "Tales in the Sand") and Part Four (#13 "Men of Good Fortune") related to the narrative of the complete volume. While there are volumes of The Sandman that don't have a single story line (like the third volume, Dream Country), I think it's clear that The Doll's House does. By the end of The Doll's House, I think it's pretty clear that the prologue's purpose was to introduce Desire's conspiracy against Dream that played out over the course of the volume. However, I still wonder about "Men of Good Fortune" -- it certainly connects to other parts of the overall storyline of the Sandman (for example, setting up a working relationship with Will Shakespeare for #19 "A Midsummer Night's Dream"); does it connect to the particular storyline of The Doll's House? I think it might fit better among the other standalone stories of Dream Country, rather than in the middle of the cohesive narrative of The Doll's House. ("Men of Good Fortune" doesn't really fit in well in Wikipedia's description of the plot.)
