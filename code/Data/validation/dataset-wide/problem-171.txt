Of all the solutions yet posted, I do not see any mention of expanding the habitable zone such that two planets with long, slightly-different orbital periods would both fit. This would require a very luminous star, I believe doubling the luminosity (average over wavelengths) would triple the distance to the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone. Our solar system has two planets (Uranus and Neptune) at 20 and 30 AU, which are in conjunction about once every 170 years. To expand the habitable zone from it's current 0.7 AU to 1.5 AU boundaries, we need a star about 8-10 times as luminous as the sun. Assuming that the star is the same colour as the Sun that would be a class IV subgiant, which would be too short-lived for life to evolve on, but could theoretically support human life that arrives there for millions of years. These are not uncommon stars, so it is completely plausible that humans find and colonize one if they are out colonizing anyway. If you need to allow for longer or shorter periods between when transfer between the planets will be possible, then you can adjust for star brightness and change the size of the habitable zone accordingly. In the interest of realism, make sure that your chosen brightness falls in an area on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram with the same colour as the Sun (above or below it on the diagram) in a relatively dense part (i.e. no Sun-coloured 100 luminosity stars). 

The immortal may become an "Adam" or "Genghis Khan" in the sense that he may sire a large portion of the population. Adam is recognised by the Abrahamic faiths as the father of all men. Genghis had 500-1000 direct offspring by most accounts. This immortal being, by fathering one child every ten years, will have by the time that the story takes place fathered as many children as Genghis Khan. Those children will have many children as well. Being spread out across the centuries, the immortal being will likely be an ancestor of almost all living beings. 

On the other end of the scale Another way of not having villages is to have only isolated houses. I'll assume: 

Basically, the more isolated from backup, and the more hostile to human life is the surrounding environment, the less you want randomness in your colony. So, you don’t want any little creature that can randomly create havoc in your colony. You are going to spray a lot of insecticide in your colony and vessels coming in, and bees are especially sensible to that. You don’t have bees, and other insects, simply because they are dangerous in a controlled environment and you don’t want them. It’s cheaper to import apples than to import replacements parts due to insect damage. 

Hunting Safari They sell hunting safari for wealthy gentlemen that grew bored of shooting lions. They will go abuser-hunting now, and will likely pay a little fortune for that. Once an abuser break the restraining order, the NGO takes its client to the neighbourhood, provide them with guns and a picture of the abusers and let’s go! Of course, they will also organize back-up and picnic, so the wealthy hunter is not killed by the prey and doesn’t get thirsty. 

Use the tide Build your structure between sea level at high and low tide. Build it inland, far enough from the sea for the tomb raiders not to think of the sea. Build a tunnel between your structure and the sea shore. Make the path in your structure long and flat enough to make outrunning the tide impossible. At every high tide, any intruder will be drowned. The whole structure can be considered as the trap. Low tide 

What an interesting and unique idea! I bet the best way to track down such a criminal would be to discover the next victim and implant Nanobots into their blood stream that begin to multiply harmlessly and go to the extremities of the body. So when your perp. takes some hair to "out-maneuvre" police, they will actually be preparing a lighthouse / beacon inside their body. Now that's ridiculous but say for example you knew this perp. disliked a politician or someone, you would have a good chance at catching them with the nanobot idea. Next suggestion would also be an implant, but based on the: "if I let go of this button, the bomb goes off" but instead make it like Agent 47 the movie, where if that one dude's heart stops his entire security brigade comes into the building. Basically death detector, but this one doesn't work so well because your pro Mutant (Mystique 2.0) doesn't need much DNA to work with and could likely get away without the need to kill their next form. Ultimately without high tech DNA scanners or the balloons in Daemon (Daniel Suarez novel) you're unlikely to get this character, you may need to develop some lame weakness depending on who the main character is and what they're attributes / skills are. If there's trace elements of the original pro Mutant then sure you could probably invent a character similar to a vampire / dog (Wolverine) who can sense or smell such a pro Mutant. Best of luck with your character development! Sounds awesome, wish I was more creative. 

This is a tuffy, but here are my thoughts: Let's take something like adrenaline to start. What does it really do? Adrenaline, aka epinephrine increases blood flow to muscles, output of the heart, pupil dilation, and blood sugar. How does it work? It binds alpha and beta receptors (G-proteins found in many cells). Now let's look at morphine, how is it capable of "muting" the feeling of pain or most things for that matter? Similar to G-proteins it affects receptors within the immune system, in fact it affects a tonne of different parts of the immune system. But the good news is that WHO (world health org) states it's the safest needed drug in the medical field. Not to mention it's produced naturally from poppy flowers (opium). Now something from Sci-Fi+Sci-Fact, Black Goo. I like the idea of both black goo and nanobots due to their ability to be virus like. However you want enhanced abilities. Sure thing, you get vitamin K from the bacteria in your gut, so why can't you drink some robots or alien bacteria that improves your vision or hearing for a short while? Nanobots can self terminate to avoid using too many resources and the alien bacteria is eventually destroyed by your immune system after a day. I'm no biologist but creativity isn't much to ask for. Finally, Adrenaline in some advanced form could likely compete with Nanobots on the level of attribute improvements you would receive. Morphine could be a template for an advanced resistance / tolerance "potion" and black goo stretches as far as your imagination can let aliens be awesome.
