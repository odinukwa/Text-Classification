Now, small as that value is, it's still 20 arcsec. The resolving power of early telescopes (and modern amateur telescopes) is 1 arcsec or better - which is more than enough. What you need is a very solid mount with good setting circles. Lacking that, you could build a telescope with a fixed position, very rigid, forever pointing at the same place in the sky - that's what Hooke did - and then you're only limited by resolving power. In any case, the precision required was quite doable with 1700s technology. An amateur could do it today, at very low cost - what you need is persistence to follow through with a long term project. 

Pluto is something like magnitude 14. The limit for the human vision is somewhere between magnitude 6 (widely accepted) and 8-ish (highly trained observers with perfect vision in ideal conditions using special techniques - and it's a bit controversial anyway). There's zero chance that was Pluto. It was definitely a fixed star. 

All of the above would be short-lived, on a cosmic scale. It would be a coincidence that you're there to see it, and you'd probably have to explain the coincidence somehow. "Asteroid fields", the way most people imagine them nowadays (very high density), are largely fiction, originating in the iconic space chase sequences in the Star Wars movies, and the like. 

Here's a practical approach - the algorithm and the equations are packaged as a software library. Install PyEphem: $URL$ Run it: 

A simple rule for the maximum magnification is: 2x the aperture in mm. In your case, that makes it 260x. But that's more like a guideline, since it's affected by so many factors. Speaking in general, trying to exceed it almost never provides any benefits, with some rare exceptions (high quality instrument, perfectly collimated, under a very stable atmosphere, observing close double stars - is one possible exception that comes to mind). So eyepieces shorter than 2.5 mm (after dividing it by the barlow magnification, if any) would likely not be beneficial for you. Combined with your 2x barlow, that means eyepieces no shorter than 5 mm (+/- 1 mm, depending on some factors). In practice, such short eyepieces are pretty rare anyway. There is also a longest usable focal length for eyepieces, which is the shortest usable focal length times 12, more or less, or about 30 mm in your case (plus or minus some change). Any longer than that and the exit pupil (the diameter of the ray of light exiting the scope) would be greater than the pupil in your eye, leading to loss of light and diminished performance. That's the theory. In practice, there's just not much benefit going much longer than that, as you will find out if you try. So stick to the 30 ... 2.5 mm interval, give or take 10 ... 20%. These limits are not set in stone, but you will rediscover them on your own, given enough time. A minimum of 3 eyepieces, and a maximum of 6 or so, should cover most use cases. But a lot of people just end up accumulating eyepieces over the years, or keep trading them. 

Fisheye lenses. Sure, it's doable. But does it really lead to "better" stargazing? It's debatable. The human field of vision is already pretty wide as it is. There are telescope eyepieces out there that operate on the principle of light amplification, and they do indeed raise the bar in terms of the faintest stars that can be seen in that telescope. They aren't cheap, though. 

Yeah, sort of. You know, at any given moment, the size and the direction of it. So you could simply subtract it from the measured position of the star you're watching. OTOH, it was an additional source of error, until speed of light and the Earth's orbital parameters were very precisely determined. Perhaps it still contributes to the noise added to the data, to some extent - I'm not entirely sure here. 

You're asking a very big question - basically, "what is the history of astronomy?" It's a very long story. Our knowledge about the size of the Universe grew slowly, bit by bit. The ancient Greeks knew that Earth is round, like a sphere, and measured its size with surprisingly good precision. $URL$ In the 1600s, with the invention of the telescope, and the idea that the Earth revolves around the Sun, scientists (Johannes Kepler and others) figured out how measure the distance from Earth to Sun. After that, it was easy to measure distances within the Solar System. $URL$ In the 1800s, we made the next step: measure distances to other stars nearby. This is something called parallax. $URL$ In the 1910s, we figured out how to measure not just the distance to nearby stars, but the whole size of our galaxy. This was done by measuring variable stars (stars that go brighter, then dimmer, then brighter again, and so on). $URL$ After that, in the 1920s, Hubble figured how to measure the distance to other galaxies - that has been answered already on this page. $URL$ 

This is a very broad topic. You can literally write entire books on it. I'll stick a short answer here for future reference. You have two main options: refractor or reflector. $URL$ $URL$ Refractor is easier. You'll need a relatively large lens with a long focal length - this will be your primary optics, at the top of your telescope. The length of your scope will be dictated by the focal length of the primary lens. You can measure the focal length by going outside when the Sun is up and trying to focus the Sun to a tiny pinpoint image - the distance then between lens and image is the focal length. As an ocular or eyepiece you could use a smaller lens with a short focal length. Much better, you could use an eyepiece from an old microscope or binoculars. The total distance between the objective (primary lens) and ocular (eyepiece) is the sum of their focal lengths. If the primary lens has focal length F1, and the eyepiece has focal length F2, then when looking at infinity the distance between them is F1 + F2. This will help you calculate the total length of the tube. However, if the ocular (eyepiece) is a divergent lens (the kind of lens that makes things seem smaller) then the total distance is F1 - F2. By the way, it's hard to measure the focal length of a divergent lens, because it doesn't make an image you can project. The magnification of the instrument will be: M = F1 / F2 Do not worry too much about magnification. Make something that works first. More magnification is not always better. In the beginning, aim for something in the 10x ... 50x range. Refine it later. Make sure the tube is rigid. A plastic pipe like the ones used in water installations should work well. Make sure all lenses are centered and aligned with precision. You don't want your lenses to be leaning in any direction. Their main axis should coincide with the axis of the scope. This is important for performance. If you get too many color fringes (little rainbows) around objects, try and reduce the diameter of the primary lens by placing a paper ring in front of it - this makes the image a bit darker but should diminish the pesky rainbows somewhat. Mount the eyepiece on a smaller tube that's sliding into the main tube. Cut the main tube a little shorter than F1 + F2. This will allow you to move the eyepiece back and forth until the image is in good focus. If you find a shop that makes prescription eyeglasses (for people with eye or vision problems), they have so-called "blank" lenses that they use to cut the glasses from. See if you can buy one of those for your primary optics. A focal length of about 1 meter should be fine (opticians call it a 1 dioptre lens, which you can find in pretty weak prescription glasses). Sometimes you can pull a good lens out of a broken projector or something, but make sure the diameter is big enough (50 mm or bigger should be fine) and the focal length is big enough (I would say anywhere between 0.5 and 2 meters - that's between 2 and 0.5 dioptres - but keep it close to 1 m if possible). The first telescope I made, many years ago, was very much like this. A blank lens from a prescription glasses maker, a plastic pipe, an eyepiece from a toy microscope. It worked reasonably well, I could see with it craters and mountains on the Moon. 

You don't. Gun powder contains its own oxygen. You can fire guns in a vacuum just fine. Primers also go off just fine in a vacuum. 

A relativistic universe which is expanding faster than light (like ours) is effectively infinite for all practical purposes. Also due to its relativistic nature and faster than light expansion, even if you assume it's not infinite at some given moment, it still doesn't have any edges or borders - for you. You're in some random place in it, the maximum speed of any possible interaction is speed of light, and the universe is expanding faster than light - then anything that happens at some (real or imaginary) "edge" is outside your realm of existence. It is effectively infinite - for you. Give it enough time and it would grow as big as you want. Give it asymptotically infinite time and it will grow asymptotically infinite. As to what the "edge" might be, see Eternal Inflation. This is a model in modern cosmology where local bubbles like ours have stopped inflating (they still expand, but not at the tremendous rate of the initial inflationary phase); however, inflation continues forever outside the bubbles and at the edges. Therefore the bubbles keep growing indefinitely at faster than light speeds. Because speed of light is a limit for any interaction inside the bubbles, for any internal observer each bubble is effectively infinite for any practical purpose. Be aware that there is no proof that this is actually the case, but this is a model that fits well what we now observe.
