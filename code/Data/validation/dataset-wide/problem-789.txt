Modern atomic clocks use atoms to determine the passing of time. So you would measure it using that. 

As a interesting side note sins our orbit around the sun is not constant it is sometimes necessary by the scientific community to prolong a year by a second or so every now and then to make clocks match the moment of the earth. There called leap seconds 

(It is worth noting that some physicists use a rather unfamiliar set of units call "natural units", under which important constants like the speed of light and the pull of gravity work out to precisely 1. These are convenient when you're pushing around equations, but require a fair bit of effort to translate into clocks and rulers when you want to build an actual experiment.) 

The sun {and hence the solar system} is moving towards the constellation Hercules, namely to the star Lambda Herculis at 12 miles per second {or 20 kilometers per second} which is 43,200 MPH The Solar system is also moving upwards, at 90 degrees to the plane of the Milky Way, at 4.34 miles per second or 15,624 MPH. But we are actually leaving the Galaxy, out about 50 light years now and will be moving out to 250 light years before it reverses. Details of the mechanics of this are explained in the link below. We also crossed the Galactic plane 2 million years ago. The Solar system is orbiting around the Galaxy at an "estimated" speed of 124 miles per second {or 200 kilometers per second} which is 446,400 MPH. The way that figure has been calculated can be found at the link below. So our "armchair Astronaut" is now moving through 6 different directions and a combined speed of approximately 574,585 MPH 

Which pretty much fits the bill of a comet. Do you think the following is a fair / recognised classification of a comet: 

Using the NED, you can search via frequency range corresponding to the selected pass band filter. I'm a beginner here and don't really understand. Here's the quote: 

Wnad what about published and homogenised variables? Are homogenised variables the avarage of all observations? 

Why is there ,,,, written along the bottom? What does that signify? What are the dots and lines showing? A range of information? In that chase, what's the relevance of the dot? Is it like this: The dot is the and then the horizontal line shows the range of recorded for that and the vertical line showing the recorded for it? Why does the between 12 - 16.3 have small amounts of and , but the between 15 - 19 have no at all, but a large amount of . The same goes for the 2 points between 10.4 - 12, except these two have a large amount of but no Maybe if you could explain the units to me and give me links to further reading it would all become a lot clearer... Update Okay is the same of the object. (Doh!) However, what is that titless axis showing? 

The Earth "wobbles" on its polar axis. This motion is not relevant (IMO) to the calculations needed to return to earth from interstellar space as it is an "in situ" motion, but it exists. The Earth revolves {spins} on its axis. For these calculations we will use the equator with a circumference of approx. 25,000 miles. One rotation of Earth is approx. 24 hours. Again this is "in situ" motion so not relevant to space travel, but adds to our "stationary chair" model 25000/24 =1041.7 MPH The Earth is orbiting the Sun once a year. The circumference of the Earth's orbit is approx. 607.6 million miles {or 940 million kilometers}. One year is approx. 365 days 365 days X 24 = 8760 hours 607,600,000/8760 = 69,360.73 MPH 

Their relationship to astronomical features is historical: it's what people used when counting rotations and revolutions of the planet were the best tools to hand. Nowadays, they are legacy values: the "true" units are other things that happen to be feasible to measure using modern tools (wavelengths of light, resonances of atoms), with particular values chosen and scaled to match the old values for continuity. And derived from them were purely matters of arithmetical convenience. Factors of 12 and 60 were common because they make it easy to do arithmetic in thirds and quarters, and when doing fractions, they reduce easily. So a value like a "second" is absolutely and utterly arbitrary; it applies to outer space exactly as well as it does here. that that's what scientists use to communicate with each other. The numbers can be scaled for their convenience: as long as they're labeled, one system is as good as any other. (Especially with computers to do the work.) Astronomers try to measure rotations and revolutions of distant bodies, and when speaking of them in public they might use "day" or "year" to help people visualize it. But when speaking to each other, they know what the technical terms mean, and avoid the ambiguity of layperson speak. 

There are then a list of 'passbands', all the way up to gamma. What is this actually mean? The amount of radiation given off by a celestial body? I'm looking at the categories I'm more familiar with: Helio. Radial Velocity Redshift Major Diameter (arcmin) Minor Diameter (arcmin) Magnitude and Filter Classifications And I'm not sure where this radiation fits in. Is it 

complete beginner here, only got into star gazing a few days ago using my friend's telescope and I don't really understand at all what any of the measurements mean. Anyway, talk about jumping in the deep end, but I'm poking around Nasa's Intergalactic Database, but sadly it's all greek to me: $URL$ Here's a galaxy: NGC 7590 Here's its basic data: EquJ2000.0 RA EquJ2000.0 DEC Velocity km/s Redshift / z Magnitude / Qual Filter Separ arc min Now I'm afraid I don't really understand what any of these measurements and their values actually mean. I remember from school what Red Shift is, its the wavelength increasing becoming 'stretched' making the light seem to appear more reddish the faster an object is accelerating away from us. But what is that z unit? I'm afraid I really don't have a clue regarding anything else... spear arc min, magnitude / qual filter? Is there a book for a brief understanding of these units? Not out to solve problems regarding celestial mechanics, I just want the NED to make a bit more sense to me so I can visualize these objects.
