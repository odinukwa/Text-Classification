It sounds like the question is asking if there can be two separate contributions due to the expansion, one simply because the distances are increasing so successive wavefronts in the wave train arrive later and later, and a second effect due to more esoteric distortions like time slowing down. But what of the redshift we attribute to something happening to space, and what we attribute to something happening to time, depend on the coordinates we choose to describe what is going on. The standard choice is comoving coordinates, where time has the meaning of "age of the universe at the point in question in a frame moving with the average gas." In those coordinates, the elapsing time isn't doing anything different as the universe expands, so the only effect you need to worry about is the stretching distances between wavefronts. 

It sounds like your question is about the single most important principle of cosmology, called the cosmological principle. This asserts that as long as all our observations are consistent with the idea that the universe is the same everywhere at a given age, we will continue to use a model with that attribute. There are lots of good reasons for adopting that principle, the least of which is not that it allows us to have a model in the first place. So what this means is, our answer to what is beyond what we can see is that we don't know, but we are going to model it in a way that makes sense to us, so we will use the cosmological principle. You have to be able to distinguish what we know in the sense of having direct information about, versus what we know about our own best models. 

Variable speed of light (VSL) theories (for instance Petit (1988) and Moffat (1993)) have been introduced in the past to solve the horizon problem you mentioned, i.e. that the observable universe appears to be isotorpic and homogeneous. If certain universal "constants" (including $c$, the speed of light) are allowed to change, then it is possible for interactions between extremely distant sections of the universe to occur, solving the horizon problem. These modifications still fit in with general relativity and the idea of an expanding universe. VSL theories, though, have not gained much traction, and inflation is still the prevailing theory in the scientific community today. It solves the horizon problem, the flatness problem (dealing with how fine-tuned the initial density of the universe appears to have been), and the magnetic monopole problem (i.e. why we don't see magnetic monopoles). Inflation isn't the only possible solution to these problems, but it works quite well.

Seems like it would be subject to Kozai oscillations at least-- see $URL$ That mechanism tends to swap obliquity for eccentricity, without changing the energies of the orbits, so it is fueled by torque rather than work. It is easier to get a slow torque from two inclined orbits than it is to get work done, because work requires a consistently oriented force, whereas torque tends to require only an overall average asymmetry in the geometry. 

You have a clear view of the history, and it wasn't an independent confirmation, it was simply the best evidence. Whenever one talks about the discovery of dark matter, one should start with Zwicky, and move to Rubin. One might do something similar with the Big Bang, starting with Hubble, and moving to Penzias and Wilson. Normally we give credit both to the initial discovery, and to the confirmation, but it is the most conclusive evidence that generally gets associated the largest credit. After all, it was Edgar Allan Poe who first described the Big Bang model, but he gets no astronomical credit because he provided no evidence. Zwicky certainly did better than that, so does deserve (and should receive) much credit, but there were still many doubters in his day, much as with Hubble and the Big Bang. Perhaps Zwicky's role contributed to the reason that Rubin never received the Nobel prize, I hope it wasn't simply the unspeakable reason, but of course it's too late now for both of them.

I'll say yes here, but only if the epicycles are used as approximations. Here's how they would be useful: 

It seems that the station has, in fact, given out extremely dangerous advice - simply because it was poorly phrased. Viewing a solar eclipse is incredibly dangerous - mostly under circumstances where you're looking towards the Sun. As Wikipedia warns, 

This isn't necessarily a full answer to your question, but this could cover at least part of it. Have you ever heard of the Roche limit? It's the distance inside which an object cannot orbit another object because tidal forces will tear it apart. That's thought to be the reason behind the rings of the gas giants: In each case, a moon could have wandered too close to the planet, and it might have been torn apart. The Roche limit varies between the parent object and the orbiting object, depending on factors such as mass and density. A simple way to calculate it is: $$d=1.26R_m \left(\frac{M_M}{M_m}\right)^{1/3}$$ where $R_m$ is the radius of the orbiting object, $d$ is the Roche limit, and $M_M$ is the mass of the parent and $M_m$ is the mass or the orbiter. While there are other factors that influence just where an object can and cannot orbit, the Roche limit is a good place to start investigating. 

Ahh, yes, I suggest you watch this short video of mine on YouTube: $URL$ I talk about the beginning of the Universe in it. Basically, space and time didn't really exist at the time of the Big Bang. A single point in space is called a zero-dimensional entity because it has no length, no width, and no height, nor does it have any other dimensions. SO no space. Also, since the Big Bang was the origin of time, you can't have anything "before" it. SO no time. And these two completely contradict your question itself: there was no spacetime. Nor was there any matter. You see, Einstein once wrote on some black board in 1905 this very particular equation: E = mc^2 This stated that mass and energy are interchangeable. Mass requires space, but energy does not. Where all this points to is: all the mass in the Universe was energy at the Big Bang, and since energy doesn't need space in order to exist, it was the Universe. Also, the term "singularity", though used by many, isn't really the right word to call the original universe. But that's ok, as long as everyone knows what you're talking about. To answer your question directly, there wasn't infinite mass in the beginning of the Universe; there was zero. There was a lot of temperature, but not infinite. And density . . . if the Universe had been infinitely dense, it would have been a black hole, and we wouldn't exist in any possible way. And there was no space-time to start with in the first place; space-time only became a later concept. A concept originating in the first 10^-35 of a second. 

I think you can actually experience the answer to your question by going out into the deep wilderness late on a night where there is no Moon, make sure no artificial lights are anywhere nearby, and simply observe. That's how dark it is in a reasonably random location in the Milky Way! It will be very dark indeed, but you might still be able to see something (other than the stars, of course). It's a good question-- can you see your hand in front of your face by starlight alone? I don't think you can, but I haven't done the experiment! 

If you imagine all three stars have similar mass, which would be a normal thing to assume as a first approximation, and assuming the incident speed is larger than the orbital velocity (it likely would be, because it is getting pulled in), then the interaction would seem to be likely to happen with one of the stars in the binary, moreso than the other. So for a short time, those two stars would behave like two objects undergoing "Rutherford scattering." It would indeed depend sensitively on the details (especially the incident angle), but it does seem pretty likely to me that it would disrupt the initial binary. It's possible that the interloping star could even grab one of the stars into a binary with itself, leaving the other one behind, but if the star comes in fast, it seems pretty likely that the original binary will at the very least be made highly eccentric, and quite likely disrupted altogether. But yes, there's no substitute for an orbital simulation. Now, it occurs to me you might be imagining the third star comes in along the axis of the original binary. In that special case, the incident star would have no effect at all if the original binary had two equal mass stars in a circular orbit-- it would simply speed up the whole initial binary toward it, and then return it to its original movement after it passes. But it wouldn't leave the stars moving-- it would erase its effect as it leaves, and all that would linger is an overall shift in the location of the barycenter. But it's a very special case there. 

After inflation, the expansion of the universe did indeed slow down. During the inflationary epoch (lasting roughly $1 \times 10^{-33}$ seconds), the universe expanded by a factor of $10^{26}$. That's incredible! However, the inflationary epoch didn't last long, and that incredible expansion ended pretty soon after it started. The universe is, as you said, still expanding. In fact (like you also said), that expansion is increasing. However, we have to be careful when we talk about the rate of this expansion. Currently, the rate of expansion between two objects depends on the distance between them, which is encoded in Hubble's law: $$v=H_0D$$ where $v$ is the recessional velocity, $H_0$ is Hubble's constant, and $D$ is the proper distance between the objects. This relation proves that objects that are farther away are moving away at a greater speed. We can extrapolate from that that, at a sufficiently far distance, two objects would be moving away from each other at the speed of light or greater! However, this is only true for objects very far from each other. But yes, eventually, any two objects sufficiently far from each other will move apart at the speed of light - and then greater.

Currently, Pluto is very much a dwarf planet. I don't think Pluto will ever be reinstated as a planet again . . . On the the pro-planet side, Pluto has five moons, which can possibly qualify it as a planet. On the no-planet side, Pluto has a mass of 1.30900 × 10^22 kilograms, which is much lower than the currently smallest planet, Mercury, which weighs 328.5 x 10^21 kilograms. Also, the diameter of Mercury is 4,879.4 km across, while Pluto’s diameter is 2,360 km across. Big difference. Really. I'm pretty sure Pluto won't be called a planet again, but I can't be certain. Look, here's the thing about controversies like this: you never know until they're over. Yes, it's a horrible answer, but it's the candid truth. At least I've given you the data. 

Well, put simply, the Sun will certainly lose at least a fourth of its mass. This is because most of the mass of the Sun is centered in its core. And since a white dwarf is just the remnant core of a star . . . Oh, and before the Sun becomes a white dwarf, it goes through the "red giant" phase, where it grows to about the size of the orbit of mars. All the planets will burn up, or stop orbiting, and they will cease to exist when the Sun's nova occurs. Happy ending . . . 

Proxima Centauri remains the nearest star to us for about 25 thousand years, at which point Alpha Centauri passes it. ~7.5 thousand years after that, Ross 248 swings in closer. It then moves away after about 10 thousand years, when Alpha Centauri moves just ahead of it for a short period of time. Gliese 445 becomes the nearest star for about another ~7.5 thousand years, until it wings away and Alpha Centauri again becomes the closest star. 80 thousand years in our future, Ross 128 nudges ahead. A few interesting things to note are that for most of this time, the nearest star is closer to the Sun than Proxima Centauri is now - indeed, there are times when quite a few stars are closer simultaneously - and that this lasts for some time as a brief spike. However, this is only a short-term pattern. In the past, many stars have come much closer - even inside the Oort Cloud. Also, to address the mention of Barnard's Star: It will swing close to us within ~ 10,000 years, but will just as suddenly swing away. As an aside, a cool animation shows the movement of stars that are near the Sun throughout their past trip around the galaxy.
