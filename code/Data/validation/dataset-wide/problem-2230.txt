There is evidence for fish feeling pain. Obviously you cannot simply say they do feel pain, only that we can observe behaviors that could be consistent with them feeling pain, and that they have the physical chemical receptors to facilitate a pain signal. A 2010 book by Victoria Braithwaite titled Do Fish Feel Pain argues that the "latest scientific evidence suggests that we should widen to fish the protection currently given to birds and mammals." I didn't buy the book, but this would suggest that her research indicates that they do. After all we wouldn't widen protection for animals that don't feel pain. Her 2002 article on the matter also suggests they have pain-like feelings. 

My suspicion is that if they get up slow enough, it's not an abrupt action, and therefore not guilty of a false start. However, I have seen some trick plays that revolve around the QB getting up slow. The infamous "wrong ball" is one, and another is where the snap is just so slow the defense isn't ready for it. 

There aren't all that many international competitions, but since this rule was enacted in 2009, it didn't seem to stop the United States team from winning the 2010 FIBA World Championship. With winning, they withdrew from the 2011 FIBA World Cup, since they already qualified for the 2012 Olympics as a result of the 2010 championship and had little to gain. So being that there has only been one world class international competition, it's difficult to say. The US did win it though, so that would seem to indicate that it was not a significant factor. Whether there was an increase in travel calls, I wasn't able to find any reports on the matter. It's also a very small sample size. To really answer this question we will have to see what happens in London, keeping track of travels against the US versus other teams. 

The most important is, of course, number of points. The second tie-breaker is number of wins in the games, which were decided in regular time or overtime. (I.e., the wins after shootouts are excluded.) The third tie-breaker is number of points that tied teams have in their games against each other. (This is slightly more complicated in the cases, when one of the teams had advantage of home ice during the season in the head-to-head games in more often than the other one. For details see below.) The fourth tie-breaker is goal difference. 

Various sources mentioned that Mario Balotelli recently missed a penalty for the first time in his career (in a professional match). For example here: 

I have tried to check at least year-end rankings. It is probably not an unexpected that I found several years where some big nations (Russia, USA) had three or more players in top 10. However, my question is not only about year end rankings. 

I will ad also link to this blog post from 2015, which analyses success rate of Top 50 players in challengers: Benoit Paire and Overqualified Challenger Contenders. 

As for the impact this is going to have on your angling, I can't say because I'm not much of an angler. Perhaps consider numbing tipped barbs or something similar. But the actual equipment selection is the scope of another question. 

Grip is a bit of a misnomer, but from a distance that's what it looks like it's doing. Having a softer material for your putter (or any disc really, but you only expect to do this with a putter) causes more of the energy to go into the chain and less energy back into the disc. The more energy in the disc, the further it's going to go. Either it's going to push the chain out of the way and fly past it, or it's going to hit the chain and bounce backward. Either way, it's going to go somewhere other than where it is - but right now it's hitting a chain, and you'd like it to stay where it is!! Imagine you shot a ping pong ball at the chain - it would bounce off almost every time (assuming you could hit the thing). But if you threw a pillow, there's a good chance that it would stay. Obviously neither ping pong balls or pillows are recommend for disc golf, but they illustrate the physics. Soft materials absorb/transfer energy instead of bouncing. 

It is basically the same as the well-known away goals rule which is commonly used for two-leg fixtures. If you look at the results in the matches between these two teams, Hapoel scored one goal in the away match (since the 1-1 draw was in Southampton). Southampton scored no goals away. (In the 0-0 draw was the match played in Beersheba, so Hapeol was the home team and Southampton was the away team.) 

As of 2015, lucky loser in the WTA tournaments is still determined as the highest ranked player. See 2015 WTA Official Rulebook (internet archive): 

The reference given there is $URL$ I do not speak Spanish but using Google Translate I understood that the match will probably be played in Valencia, although the decision will not be official until the next meeting of the Board of the RFEF, scheduled for March 4. 

I was not sure where to find some reliable statistics that could confirm Worsley's concecutive 50-saves games. 

Are there some official rules about which rider's time determines team's result in team time trial? Or is it decided by organizer of each individual race? 

I'm not sure if you can say that one strategy is better than another. I think the best thing you can do if you're concerned about this would be to watch a lot of tape on your opponents and see what they do most often and try to adapt your strategy to it. If they often send someone wide for a cheap pass then maybe you will want to widen or shift your wall to compensate or send an extra rover to handle them. If they often go for the top of the net then perhaps you will want to have your guys jump. I think it all depends on your analysis of your opponent which comes from playing them in the past and from watching a lot of film. 

For what it's worth, the defense has been doing this to the quarterback for years. Now that the defense has an announced coordinator with the bench, it allows the offense to start picking up on this too. Unfortunately, only 3 people often have an opportunity to see what the defense is doing, and two of them are usually so far away from everyone they can't communicate with them anyway. 

Premier League Red cards ar not mentioned in the article Premier League records and statistics. The article Football records in England mentions matches with 6 and 5 red cards, but not from Premier League. I did not find any mention of game with most red cards in the Wikipedia articles Bundesliga records, Football records in Italy, Ligue 1 records. 

In the Wikipedia article 2017 IIHF World Championship I read that: The rules state that "the bottom ranked two teams will be relegated" and the 2018 hosts (Denmark) cannot be relegated by rule. The reference given in the Wikipedia article is Statutes and Bylaws (701.3) (Internet Archive). However the information there is not much more detailed: 

I encountered term bagel girl in connection with a tennis player. I understood approximately the meaning of this term from the context, but could some clarify it in more detail? Is there also male equivalent for this colloquial term? 

(The picture is taken from $URL$ There are three little blue symbols at the bottom. I suppose the middle one, with the cutlery, means feed zone. However, I was not able to guess the meaning of the symbols and , which seem somewhat like light bulb or a bottle. 

In both the NFL and NCAA, there are official capacities that the captain must fulfill. Only one designated captain (at a time) is permitted to communicate the teams official decision of a penalty (to accept or decline) to the referee, and there are rules about how you can change captains. NFL: 

Ideally, you'd have a little straw follow you around and you could have a constant drip of hydration. Take a cup at every water station, and take a few sips. Depending on how far apart they are, you'll want to drink more or less, aiming for an ounce of water every 4 minutes since your last station. This isn't an exact calculation, but it's a good place to start from. This is going to leave you with leftover water almost every time. I personally would use the remaining water to cool off and keep yourself alert with a good face splash. Unless it's gatorade, then it probably wouldn't feel so good on your face :) 

Typically, in NFL and other sports, assistant coaches are responsible for a particular aspect of the team, while the head coach is responsible for the overall direction of the team. For example in football you might have a quarterback coach, an offensive line coach, a running back coach, a kicking coach, a special teams coach, an athletic fitness coach, many of whom are given the title of assistant coach. Their job is to provide specific and expert direction in their areas. This isn't to say that the head coach wouldn't also be an expert in all areas of his team, because it would be bad if he wasn't. But his level of expertise will not be that of the specific coaches, unless he happened to grow out of that position or coaching position before being promoted to head coach. It is very common for someone to be promoted to head coach and keep the responsibilities he held before promotion (especially in interim promotions). Some teams do have a specific title of "Assistant Head Coach" - their responsibility is to act as the enforcers of the plan set forth by the head coach. The head coach can only supervise so many things at a time - some clubs feel the need for the extra management. Only two NFL clubs have an "Assistant Head Coach" position that is not also another type of coach like Offensive Line or Defensive Line - Kansas City and St. Louis. It could be a regional thing, both those teams have had a pretty rocky couple years lately, so it could just be that they wanted the extra emphasis on following the team direction. I can't find a reference for it, but I would assume that for the teams that have Assistant Head Coaches that are also another type of coach (about half of them do) that if for some reason the Head Coach were unavailable, incapacited, or otherwise unable to perform his duties, that the Assistant Head Coach would take his position. 

Two statistics, that are most frequently given for ice-hockey goaltenders are save percentage and goal against average. 

When I look at calendar of junior tournaments on the ITF website, I see that each tournaments are given some kind of category: They are marked, for example, as Grade 1, ..., Grade 5, Grade B2, Grade A. What does this mean in practice? Does it influence how much points can player get from the tournament into ranking? Does it somehow influence who can compete? 

On several occasions, when checking odds offered by bookmakers, I have noticed that they have been changing rapidly as the time of the event get closer. (This was particularly noticeable during the fast few minutes before the start of the event.) Why does this happen? 

I know that race rankings, i.e. points only from this calendar year, are used to decide players at year end ATP/WTA championships. My question is whether the rankings just one week before the finals are taken into consideration, or whether the decision is made sooner. For example, this year in WTA tour Kremlin Cup in Moscow and Luxembourg Open in Kockelscheuer will be played during the week before the WTA Finals. Can the points from these tournaments influence who will be contenders at the year end championships? The situation in ATP Tour is a bit different (at least this year) since no tournaments are scheduled during the last week before the ATP World Tour Finals. Similarly, before WTA Elite Trophy there will be one week gap (since no players will play at both at WTA Finals and WTA Elite Trophy). But we can still ask the same question - which tournaments will be relevant for the decision who qualifies for these year-end tournaments.
