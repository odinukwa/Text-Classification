I imagine such an interface would feel like an extra limb or two - say, an extra pair of hands. Or eyes. Or a whole new body, depending on how far you want to go. The only real problem I see here, is where exactly these "limbs" will be "attached" to your physical body, especially without feeling like they'd bump into things around you. My guess here is going along a "fourth dimension" or something. (Which is what the whole internet thing is already, anyway.) As for feedback from these extra "limbs", it'll be like moving your arms about with your eyes closed; you can still feel how the different joints are stretched out, and this will tell you where your hands are without you having to look. And this is before you get the skin's feedback as you start bumping into things. Similar with these implants. The most sensible (to me) option, is to have them feel like arms/hands/fingers with a set number of joints, and so moving those joints would trigger events; kinda like moving your fingers across a keyboard. Get some proper practice with this, and only then do you assign which events go with each "keypress". One advantage of this, is you can "key" and "mouse" indefinitely with these extra "limbs" without suffering (physical) fatigue or carpal tunnel or anything, while fiddling with that drawing/song/whatever. Not that this would exclude composing by "thought-to-MIDI" or anything; tapping directly into the thought process sounds like a nice, quick way of writing/composing/etc, while the extra "limbs" deal with commands like "dial this number". These are two options, and it'll be possible to have both. 

Being aliens, these creatures would indeed be more "insect-like" than "actual insects", (presumably with lungs, a cardiovascular system, etc) but that could still leave them with "growing pains" from the exoskeletons. Thing is, the species here on Earth that use exoskeletons (like crabs/lobsters/etc), tend to have to shed them regularly as they grow, leaving them vulnerable until the new one has been properly grown. Which would be why insects have this stage where they grow their one and only skeleton, which they then keep using until they die. Hence the three stages (egg, larva, pupa) before going into full adulthood. Our alien friends could be expected to have a somewhat different road to adulthood. Like the queen giving birth to live larvae to bypass the egg stage. Being large enough to be intelligent (even sentient), they may also have a way to school their young in the new ways of a world that changes too fast for (natural) evolution to keep pace. That way the new adults would have more than just instincts telling them what to do (and how to do it). 

If the people from history were still around, history would move more slowly. The idea that Racism is acceptable in the Western world is decreasing/dead because younger people don't think racism is okay (brought up that way with media and legal influence to ensure it) and the people who thought racism is okay are dying out. The morals/beliefs/stigmas of the past would still be present today even more than they currently are. I don't believe that religion is BS but water nymphs and mermaids are. Likely some people who claimed to have seen them in the 1500's would still be making that claims today. We would have more spread out children. We would still on average have roughly (+50 to 200% likely due to increased unnatural death rates) same number of children to maintain the population. Raising them would however take only 1.8% of our lives compared to 18% now. Our childhood would also be less large the same way. This would mean there would be about 10% the number of children in the world. This by itself is worth of a very long study. Easier to note, however, is that you will have fewer close age siblings. Unless you are twins or your parents are bad with birth control, you will not have siblings within 5 years of your current age. War would be worse. The horrible effects of war including the population decrease would last for 100s of years. Grudges would last longer. America would still hate Japan and everyone would hate Germany. That was less than the equivalent of less than 10 years ago. War would be less. "While I still remember the horrible things you did, I am still wounded from the last war. Our ideologies aren't really that different from the last time we fought." The rate of technological increase would seem larger. This would mean that people who thought the cotton gin was innovative would be trying to learn how to use an Iphone. That would be the norm! Our greatest minds would have 100s of years more to study the universe and (assumed) the memory to support it. If anything the actual rate of technological increase would be faster. Nevertheless, this means that a large portion of the population would be left behind to only do manual labor unless continuing education becomes more significant. Expect to return to school for a decade every 100 years to stay on the cutting edge of whatever exremely nuianced area you are actually an expert in. We would actually make things right! We wouldn't build houses meant to last 100 years... we would construct them of stone. The Rule for Life people would actually be the people who did something. The monarchys of our world have been the children of the children of conquerors. Most monarchs, would be the son of the conqueror who fought by his side. Increase unnatural death rates and death via disease would be observed for several reasons. If every time i go to the store i have some chance of dieing in an car accident, living to 1000 would give me alot more car rides. The same is true for fights with wild animals and older farmer brothers, floods, and extradimensional abductions. If we don't have kids till 200 then more people will die before having kids. More people will die of accidents and disease than old age. This also means more disabled people who survive the accidents living longer. With respect to punishment, if we became able today to live to 1000, I would demand loudly and aggressively for the death sentence for any convicted murderer. Currently a life sentence costs the amount to keep them alive for roughly 60 years. Death sentence costs legal fees plus the amount of time needed for due process (say 20 years). Life sentence is more economical is most cases. If you bump that up to 500 years+ of upkeep... 

I have read questions such as these two about aliens adapted to environments with high atmospheric pressure experiencing negative effects when exposed to Earth's comparatively low atmospheric pressure. This question is different because I want to know how to prevent negative effects from occuring with the opposite situation. Mars has ~1% of the atmospheric pressure and 38% of the surface gravity of Earth. Some Martians, who are comparable in mass and body plan to Humans, want to visit Earth for cultural exchange. But exposure to a hundred times the air pressure and nearly three times the gravity under which they've evolved will very probably kill them. Humans offer to provide them with pressure suits, but a Human spacesuit is designed to maintain high internal pressure compared to vacuum. Would a suit allowing a Martian to withstand Earth's conditions, by maintaining low internal pressure, have to be significantly different in structure and design from the spacesuits that Humans use? If she were supplied with the CO2 and H2 she breathes instead of deadly oxygen, could a Martian gear up in a standard Apollo-era NASA spacesuit with no design alterations and survive on Earth? Otherwise, what changes would be needed for the suit to maintain low internal pressure without collapsing? Also, Earth's gravity isn't really an issue addressed by spacesuits made on Earth, but even with proper (de)pressurization, would it need to provide her with additional support to stand and walk under Earthly gravity while wearing it? 

In the mid-21st century, humanity has an interplanetary colony system principally spanning the Moon, Mars, and Titan (as per usual). The furthest established colony is on Proxima b. Humans have FTL drives that can reach 12,500 times c without time dilation effects, and which can accelerate to this speed in under a minute. However, we are still reliant on light-speed signal transmission. We send data back and forth very frequently between our colonies. Some people on Proxima b, while waiting for the previous Summer Olympics results, figure that beyond a certain distance, it's more efficient to just strap an FTL drive to a hard drive and lob it upwards into space than it is to send a signal and wait for it to arrive at c. A hard drive will need time to accelerate and decelerate to avoid damage, and it will need to be processed at its destination to access the data. This processing could take less than a minute if, say, a satellite net of some sort catches it, plugs it in, and then relays the data at c to the colony below, or several hours if the hard drive has to actually land. The FTL drive can launch from the ground. But let's say they've already got the former system set up. This is a two-part logistical problem. Firstly, what is the break-even distance for sending a light-speed signal versus sending an FTL hard drive? It's not simply a matter of the distance from the source at which an FTL hard drive overtakes a signal at c, it also involves what people would find more convenient, and it might involve signal decay by the inverse square law (I don't know). For example, I don't think an FTL hard drive would be worth it between the Earth and the Moon - 3 seconds of ping time beats the processing time, even if it gives Lunar Dota 2 players a headache. Secondly, given the colonies I've noted, do any of them have differences in their maximum and minimum distances from each other such that they would pass break-even at different times, and one method would be more convenient than the other for part of the time? In such a case, would one method of data transmission still be preferable to the other? (I'd like to credit xkcd for partial inspiration.) 

The formula is: $$f'=f\frac{\sqrt{1+\beta}}{\sqrt{1-\beta}}$$ where c is the speed of light, f is the frequency of the light normally, v is the velocity of the observer, $\beta$ is $\frac v c$ and f' is the freqyency of light observed by the observer. For blue light (650THz) to xrays (1500000 THz), you would need $\beta=.99999962$ so you would need to be very very close to the speed of light. 

Biological Reason for Low Incidence Rate: There is some genetic detail of the force so that can't be easily passed on. Maybe sensitivity is a non-inheritable genetic mutation. Maybe it requires an additional chromosome similar to a favorable down syndrome or Turners. Maybe a mother, especially one who is not force sensitive, will be damaged by a force sensitive fetus resulting in a miscarriage or maternal death. There are many ideas for this, some interesting and some limiting storywise. Lack of Reproduction Among Upper Class: I don't think this takes much explanation as it is a real phenomenon. Rich families often produce fewer children than individuals with less wealth. Explain this in your world, however, you like: they don't want to sacrifice their me time raising them; private schooling (force training) is expensive; too busy working since they have the hard ruling party jobs; their religion dissuades attachment or sex. This won't help a specific noble family, however, unless they wait too long to start trying. Culling: It is dark but good for story. Someone seeks out and kills younglings. Maybe it is a secret organization. Maybe it is public knowledge. Be creative as to why. Maybe they aren't killed but kidnapped...how is that for a story? Other Removal from Gene Pool: Force users are likely to become infertal (or specifically unable to bring force sensitive children to sexual maturity). This would be best if it has nothing to do with the force but is a result of inbreeding to try and produce force sensitive children. Accidental Self Injury: Force users can do amazing things but they don't realize the downside. Some force sensitive children experience SIDS as they use their powers without control on themselves as infants. Older ones playing with their abilities don't know how limited their self control is...until it is too late. Maybe all of them incur some degree of physical damage to their body through the use of their powers and that leads to chronic illness or acute fatal symptoms a fraction of the time. Asymmetric Heritage: This is different from 1 but similar. Midoclorians (I don't care enough to check spelling) are inspired by mitochondria. These are passed on only from mother to child. Maybe only the mother can pass on the force so the father's procreation rate doesn't matter. Not knowing this, the matriarch of the family is the result of adultery/secret adoption and, as they bring in force sensitive male suitors, nothing helps. The remaining force sensitive men obviously can't do anything, as much as they get to try, unless they mate with the force sensitive woman who can't just be paid to act as livestock for breeding. 

Foreword: I am asking this question primarily to decide if a nocturnal race makes sense for my purposes before I develop them in too great a depth. This means I do not have much detail to provide on their biology or culture, just a basic outline. Hopefully it's enough. Permanent settlements are dependent on sustained agriculture. A sapient extraterrestrial nocturnal race are omnivorous and capable of tool use, and are already at what we would call an early Neolithic level of technology - i.e. they have blades, art and clothing (or their equivalents), but no domesticated animals. They are not cave-dwellers. They wake at dusk and go to sleep with the dawn on their world, which has a day-night cycle and an axial tilt similar to Earth's, and perhaps several small natural satellites. They are not necessarily humanoid, and likely resemble a non-primate clade. How does a population of this race come to develop agriculture on a scale that can sustain a permanent settlement and thus lead to civilization? Chiefly what I'm asking is, if you're asleep during the day, how do you manage crops, take care of them, and guard them from intruding diurnal animals, among other things, well enough to settle down? Would they have large farms of grass/grain crops like we do, or would they need to farm something more unusual? (Again, they don't dwell in caves, so I don't think they would farm cave-dwelling life like bioluminescent fungi.) Or to put it another way, are there any standard and necessary agricultural processes that are particularly difficult to accomplish at night? I would prefer that their agriculture take a form recognizable to us as agriculture (you see their farm and think "farm"), but only if it's justifiable. (There's no need to address the domestication of animal livestock for the moment, but it's welcome if you do. Assume their livestock could be either diurnal or nocturnal, probably something they would already be hunting, or it could be for non-food products.) Edit, promoted from comment: The reason I think developing agriculture at night would be a problem is that I feel that being awake during the day would give one a better chance of coming to understand what kind of nutrition and resources plant crops demand. It would take a lot of work staying up past one's bedtime to determine how to lay out fields for the best sunlight and such, which I feel would be too much fine detail for a population on the initial cusp of agriculture to accomplish or to have a sense for. 

It depends on what you define as a legal person. Currently the punishment for animal cruelty is much less than murder. I think uplifted animals will almost immediately be seen as human for the case of being victims of violent crimes. A cute smart doggie should not be a victim. Likely capital punishments for criminal uplifted animals will remain in place for a long time even if your setting wouldn't otherwise have the death penalty. That is the current procedure for violent animals and it is easy to argue "the procedure didn't take properly". There will be some support for even punishment, however. There will be an even larger fight against animal-human marriage than with gay marriage (because ew). Which ever party gains the most by supporting voting rights for animals will heavily argue in favor of it while the other party may fight it. I essence with all this differentiation, laws will not be exactly the same for an elevated animal and a human. There are minute differences in laws for women and men (usually legal precident concerning paternity, divorce, sexual harrassment, etc.) and we pretty much the same. Between different species of animals there are differences. As a result, expect large protests fighting for these rights and a more silent majority against these changes. Expect that all species will eventually be viewed slightly differently under the laws based on intellegence potential, physical ability, and population. Insects will never be able to get an equal right to vote (can't ever be 18 anyways) while the voting age for dogs will drop to 2.5 human years (18 dog years). Final note: if a completely new country forms after this change with large enough populations of each uplifted species, you can expect voters to be represented by species in a simular way to how they are by state in the united states. Cats can decide their own appropriate voting age but their alloted number of seats in congress will be decided by some combination of total population, potential intellegence, and lifespan. 

I am going to compare a 50kg and a 1g spider with a silk radius of .003mm. The breaking stess would be about 1000MPa for an average spider. Lets say the giant spider manages to get this up to 2000MPa which is the strongest in the world. Quick calculation shows that the 1g spider can hold about 3 times its body weight of a single thread of silk. How much would that need to be for a 50kg spider? Only .5mm This calculation is enough to show that in theory a spider with thin strands (say 2-3 mm) would be possible. In practice a spider often uses several strands of silk together. I have my doubts about the accuracy of the .003mm radius. Basically, however, this shows that a giant spider could still possibly use silk like a small one iff it were worth it. I don't believe that it is an evolutionarily favorable path which is why we don't see it. In your world, however, you could possibly make it work. Please note that there are likely many nuances that would make this more difficult for a larger spider. I don't want to lift myself by such a small part of my body. The thin diameter likely increases mechanical strength more than bulk properties would imply. There is likely evaporation which occurs in the thin strands which would not occur in a thicker one. There is potential to focus stress on a small region of the silk. Nevertheless, spider silk's properties are incredible and, while they would need to be thicker for a giant spider, they would not really need to be THAT thick.
