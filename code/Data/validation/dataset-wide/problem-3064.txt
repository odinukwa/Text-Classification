The lighting difference for Cyrenaica and Greece is practically insignificant - they both are far from poles. The points 2 and 5 depend on the slow longtime changes of the climate and thus are the subject of history. For nowadays Cyrenaica is the part of dezert or very close to it. And it was not in the antic times. So, the agriculture timings now are much more strict. And the time for riping is longer, than in Greece, if you do not water the culture. So, nowadays, it is not so sure about earlier harvesting in Cyrenaica. On the contrary, you could wait for your wheat forever. As for the antic times, when the Northern Africa grew the wheat for the whole Rome Empire, the desert regions were far from the coast. The region was only somewhat dry. The temperatures of 350BC, according to 1850-year cycles, should be similar to these of 1500AC, or were at the lower end. So, the winter should be noticeable. And Cyrenaica's inhabitants had to adapt the starts/ends of agriculture cycles to the same season changes, as in Greece. Of course, you are absolutely right, the warmer weather meant earlier spring seeding and harvesting. The dry summer moved the harvesting time in the same direction. They in Cyrenaica had to harvest their spring wheat much earlier. It is not so simple with the second harvest. I am not sure Greece had one in that climate. So, it is unclear, what is to be compared. And I don't know if Cyrenaica had enough summer rains to seed wheat in July and not to wait for the September rains. 

The legend of Archimedes came to us from the medieval times. And notice, nobody found anything strange, on the contrary, it was natural that a ruler/king asks a specialist to check the item. I haven't heard or read any mention about some royal family member to obtain a gemology or goldsmithing education. Without that we could only believe in some sacred abilities of the kings. Counterfeit stones were often found in some historical crowns. Scotland, for example. What is interesting, the meaning of the word counterfeit was different in the past. If some stone looked as a precious one, it was taken for a precious. For example, in the Czech crown of Charles IV, there are some stones that are not precious by themselves. But they were beautiful and that was enough. In the medieval times they would take artificial rubies for absolutely natural, even if they knew they were made. And any stone that was not a real ruby, but looked as such, and was harder than quartz, would be taken for a ruby, too. They could not tell two stones from each other, so these stones were the same for them. BTW, our science work the same way, only we can distiquish much better. 

Moscow was build on a small river. It is in the 20th Cent. when through a channel Volga waters poured into Moskva river and it became... hmmm... a medium river. Rome was built on Tiber - even smaller river. Maya cities were built on marshes. Really, old capital cities, especially in Europe, were rather small towns in nowadays terms and even a small river was enough at start. And later they simply transported the fresh water, if needed. Often by water, as in old Moscow or Venice. A city needed rather a strong agricultural area around - the food was more serious problem. And in the East they used some alternative methods to get the water. Karez water systems, or simply covering all valleys and mini-valleys bottoms by flat stones. The water condenses on the stones at night, gets below, cannot be evaporated during the day due to the covering and pours safely along the valley. In the end of 18th century in Kafa there lived more than 150000 people using this atmospheric water by hand made brooks. After Russia got Crimea, the stones were taken for buildings and brooks disappeared. And the same town Feodosia in the end of 20 century had only 75000 inhabitants taking the water from the Dnepr by a huge channel. So, using green technologies, you needn't a river. And without them, any river is not enough. 

There is a picture of New Hampshire Volunteer Militia on parade in 1846. I have found more photos of soldiers from 1846, but the date was unsure for them. This seems to be the oldest military photo. 

No, it is impossible out of pure logic. While Robespierre was not yet the leader of the Committee of National Convention, he was not a terrorist. After he became one, together with Saint-Just he became practically a half-dictator of France and absolute rulers, sorry, cannot be bought by money. It would be too expensive. He could be proposed safety, asylum, but even if he was a paid agent before he got to power, he would never remain one once he had got to it. How could he use these money? French money? Any number could be printed for the sake of revolution if he needed it. British pounds? Having them meant you are a traitor. Even blackmailing wouldn't work - he could declare it a propaganda, and simply kill the possible witnesses in France. And witnesses outside were all absolutely irrelevant because of the isolation. Was Stalin afraid of any foreign accusations? No! - and USSR was much less isolated than revolutionary France. As for evidences - His descendants surely could create heaps of them afterwards. And now we can't check them save by logic. Let us use it! Beria in USSR was also declared as an English agent. I think, no there is not an intelligent being that believe in that. And be sure, there were evidences! 

You have two questions in one - the title and the last sentence. I am answering to the last one. There were some people before, who tried to explain to the Catholic Church that the greed is bad and to remain in it. Gus, Wycliffe. But what was hard in 14th century, at Wycliffe's life, became impossible in 15'th. Wycliffe was not killed or expelled. Gus was burnt and declared to be an heretic. It was not real at Luther's time to try to make the Church be honest and to remain in it. Or alive. The only way to change the Church these times was from outside. And eventually, the threat to lose all influence to Protestants, made the Catholic Church to become less rigid and to change. There is absolutely nothing strange in it. 

The main difference is that we know more than 300% of information on the Russian revolution and its consequences. (Everything in 3 or more versions). And we know nothing about the Egyptian revolution and its consequences. Hmm.. One little problem. In Russia in 1917 there were two revolutions. Absolutely different, nothing in common. Which one are you talking about? 

The question is different now and requires a new answer. Have you read Jack London's The People of the Abyss? Yes, commoners in England slept in one bedroom, and many of them lived in one room, too. 

Apart from leather hinges that were used even when iron was common (but not so common as to be cheap), there existed the different mounting of the door. I have heard about its use from my grandfather, when I asked for explanation about what is the "heel" of the door in Russian fairy-tales. The whole side of the door frame worked as a huge hinge - this side was made of a bit longer piece of wood, that fitted into shallow holes in the appropriate places in the outer frame. The sticking out pieces were called "heels". They are mentioned by several Russian fairy-tales, when a Door asks a hero to grease her heels. (The good hero does and gets some help). Obviously, the very thick and heavy wooden doors of the old Russian houses simply could not be held by leather strips. (The boards were extremely expensive). And the leather had yet to be attached to the door somehow, too. 

No, it is not an accidental coincidence. It is a should-to-be coincidence. The Winter Solstice is a natural start/end of a year. Of course, the end of the current period of the Mayan calendar should coincide with the end of the year. Their calendar consists of cycles, as the Asian one. (Linear calendar, instead of cycle ones, is the European invention.) And cycles consist of the whole years, from start to end. Their calendar was good enough to fit the planetary movements for thousand of years - that is the only explanation of the "coincidence". 

Yes, there were some, more than one and surely more than we know. These known ones were from times about 6 centuries before Christ. Scriptures of Buddhism were not less revolutionary. Buddha is considered as a teacher of people and gods. Christ had never reached so far. Avesta of Zarathustra was the first documented teaching of kindness. Even in the Bible itself there are prophets, that were before Christ. Being good, kinder than people around you is always hard. In times of Christ, 600 years before him or 2000 years after. Christ became the symbol of kindness for really many people, but historically he was not unique in his kindness. (Thank God.) Yanush Korczak, for example, chose to go into gas cameras of the death camp with his orphans. As for probability, every time when some society degenerated in morals, sooner or later came somebody or somebodies, who created new moral system that originated a new society. The rarity of the Crist/St. Paul's feat is in the fact, that their feat was not forgotten. And I would say, that the fact that they could live long enough to create Christianity and even to become known personally shows that the society they lived in was far from being the most cruel one. 

On the territory of the former USSR about 1000AC the most modern cities were Samarkand, Bukhara, Gurganj, Kharezm and so on. Not Kiev. These times it was the Islam civilization that was the most civilized. Kiev and the whole Eastern and Western Europe were the barbarous outskirts. In Christian Europe, only Byzanz was somewhat cultured. But the Middle Asia remained modern and rich only while the Silk Way worked. After Vasco Da Gama opened the trade route by the ocean, the life of MA quickly started to be poor and backward. Only Persia managed to retain some industry of its own. But of course, these cities wouldn't become the capital of the Russia simply as very foreign cities. Rarely the capital appears on an annexed land. St.Petersburg is a very rare exception. Kiev was already strongly degraded by Mongols, but even if it wasn't, it couldn't become a capital of Russia for the same reason - it was taken from a neighbour. On the other side, there could be another center of uniting of Eastern Slavs lands. And there was! The Lithuania's state language was Belorussian. Vilnius was the main capital and Minsk the second one. Lithuania included Kiev as a city of lesser importance than these two. For many centuries Lithuania at first alone or united with Poland later was much more powerful than Moscow state. It was this double-state that saved Europe from Ottomans. Why didn't Vilnius or Warsaw become the capital of a great state from the Central Europe to the Far East? Because Poland/Lithuania lost to the Russia. The reasons of THAT could be the subject of another question. 

The result And at the end of the XIX century this moral relativismus struck back, lowered the visible moral level of the society (the real one was the same) and the cruelty returned back and empowered the society, that was unprepaired and had no mechanisms against it. And it continued until some social and politicals mechanisms appeared. 

These days many people considered themselves as people of future. And the future way of feeding people was seen in mass growing of chlorella in ponds and lakes - to make a huge soup bowls for the whole towns or cities - they preferred collectivismus in everything. Yes, greenhouses and hydroponics were also considered as methods of future, but not for long. They didn't really start in practice and the harsh reality of collectivization soon destroyed all these enthusiasts and their ideas. As for alternate ways of food growing, the most interesting way was seriously considered in the end of USSR existence. I was myself (in ~1985) on the conference for the alternative methods in industry and agriculture, and one of the main themes there was... 

There was the same trench war on the East, too. Simply sometimes on both fronts HAPPENED something that broke that system. And after some time of manoeuvre war it returned to the same trench war. On the West it happened at the first German attack and in the end of the war. On the East it happened at the first Russian attack, at Brusilov's attack, when Romania entered the war and immediately lost, and at the end, when Russian army refused to fight after the revolution. The trench war was present even on Italian and Serbian fronts. But they happened to be broken sometimes, too. All of contemporary soldiers and generals(but not politicians!), hated the trench war. And tried to break it from the both sides. Sometimes somebody managed to do it. But never England/France. Every their success was the result of politics and economics, but never of some clever warfare. Yes, they invented much, as all greater participants did, but every such invention was immediately answered by another one. So, some inventions broke stalemate once, some never. And E/F were not successful in that till the very end of the war. The trench war doesn't mean there are no movements at all. There were advances and retreats. The greater movements on the Eastern front was the result of absolutely crazy politics of the Russian Czar, Nikolaj II. Several times his allies asked him for help, and he sent millions of soldiers for their death because of his playing the knight. Sometimes these offensives won, more often they lead to problems. The last such "ordered by allies" offensive attempt was in the summer of 1917. And that was one of the most important reasons of the Bolshevik's revolution. Because nobody in Russia already wanted to fight for somebody else.
