HMAS Rankin at periscope depth The Germans didn't know when the invasion was going to happen and would have to keep submarines in the Channel for weeks. This would leave them extremely vulnerable to all of the above. It's a nightmare scenario for a U-Boat captain. When the invasion did come, what would the U-Boats do? This was at a time when the Germans had already lost the Battle of the Atlantic. The Allies had beaten the U-Boat, and the U-Boat was vulnerable. Any invasion fleet would be heavily escorted by normal warships, as well as dedicated ASW ships and aircraft. An enemy submarine approaching such a fleet would be suicide. If they got a shot off, they'd be pounced upon by aircraft and escorts. For a similar and more detailed answer, see Why didn't Germany blockade the Strait of Gibraltar during WW2? 

It's hard to say what would have happened had the UN cease fire not happened, but the military situation on October 22nd greatly favored the Israelis on all fronts. On the Syrian front, things were not looking good for Syria. Israeli troops were 40km from Damascus. The Israeli air force had superiority and had knocked out the Syrian air defense system. Israel was focused on stabilizing the front to concentrate on Egypt. Syria had been resupplied by the Soviets and was preparing a counter-attack and were bolstered by an Iraqi expeditionary force, however their track record against the Israelis did not bode well. In the Sinai, both sides had crossed the Suez Canal, but the Israelis posed the much greater threat. The Egyptians would have to fight across 100 miles of the poor terrain of the Sinai to threaten Israel. With few roads, little cover, and outside their umbrella of SAM protection, the Israeli air force would have a field day. On the other hand, Israeli forces were just 40 miles from Cairo and able to threaten Egyptian cities. Egypt had lost large numbers of armor and aircraft, and their vital SAM umbrella was being cut to pieces by the Israeli cross-canal counter attack. Their units in the Sinai were in danger of being cut off and the Israelis were preparing to reduce these pockets. The Israelis were about to take Ismailia, a major road and supply hub for the Egyptian units fighting at the canal. At sea, the Mediterranean navies of both Egypt and Syria were defeated. The small Israeli navy had the run of the coastline, bombarding installations and landing commandos at will. The Gulf of Suez was blockaded damaging the Egyptian economy. On the other hand, the Egyptians had blockaded Israel at Bab-el-Mandeb beyond their reach. In short, Israel was no longer surprised and had the upper hand on all fronts and directly threatened the heartland of both Egypt and Syria. While they were fighting a two front war, they had the option of switching to a defensive stance. Militarily, the UN cease fire saved Syria, and particularly Egypt, from more defeats. What Israel would have done had they actually conquered significant amounts of Syrian and Egyptian territories... well, they don't manage what they have very well as it is. The wild cards included whether Jordan would intervene on behalf of Syria (post war documents suggest nothing more than a token), whether Israel would be able to keep up the pace in a two front offensive battle, and whether both sides would continue to be heavily supplied by their superpower sponsors. 

The Invasion of Iceland was of a character wholly different than the German annexations and invasions of 1938-1940 and it has been justifiably left in the dustbin of history. The "invasion" was by 700 ill-equipped, ill-prepared, and very seasick British marines who walked off the ship, onto a dock and talked to the police officers waiting for them. The only casualty was a British soldier who committed suicide. Iceland was compensated and allowed to go about their business. True to their word (and needing the troops elsewhere), the British left in 1941 after convincing the US (then neutral) to take over. In contrast the annexation of Czechoslovakia and Poland were expressly for the purpose of creating room for more Germans at the expense of whomever was already living there. Cities were bombed and civilians were attacked, and politically troublesome people were executed. And that was just in 1939 before the Germans got really nasty. That said, the Scandinavian countries got the shit end of the stick in WWII with both the Axis and Allies acting deplorably. Scandinavia was steadfastly and earnestly neutral and willing to trade with either side. Unfortunately they were in a strategically valuable position and had valuable iron ore. The belligerents did not believe they could protect their neutrality. Britain, Germany and the Soviets feared the other would invade to get the advantage, so they invaded first. Finland was invaded by the Soviets over fears Germany would invade them through Finland. Britain pretended to want to support Finland, but it was an excuse to invade Norway and block shipments of Swedish ore to Germany. Germany invaded Norway because they were afraid the British would invade Norway first and block the ore shipments, and to use it as a naval base to attack the UK. Iceland was invaded by the British to prevent the Germans from doing it first, but the Germans had no plans for Iceland until after the Germans invaded. Finland sided with Germany when they invaded the Soviet Union, thus the Soviets caused their own fears to happen, but the Finns honorably refused to advance beyond their pre-war borders even when the Soviets were at their lowest point. When the tide turned in favor the Soviets and the Finns negotiated a cease fire, the Soviets thanked them for their restraint by forcing the Finns to oust the Germans. What a mess. 

This M4 Sherman is on display at the Central Museum of Armed Forces of Ukraine in Kiev. It was knocked out by the Germans during the Great Patriotic War and recovered from a bog in 2004. 

Yes, but it wasn't a trial run for Popeye. There was a series of classified "rainfall augmentation" projects called Project Gromet. Gromet was over India in 1967, and Gromet II: Wallace's Revenge was over the Philippines in 1969. They were classified military projects to increase rainfall for both military and civilian purposes. You find a lot of that dual-purpose projects in the 60s. Operation Popeye was happening simultaneously with Gromet from 1967 to 1972 and was for purely military purposes. Rather than Gromet being a "trial run" for Popeye it was more the other way around. The testing for Popeye in 1966 is part of what encouraged Gromet. The "trial run" for Popeye was Project Stormfury from 1962 to 1983, an experiment to weaken cyclones by seeding them. It wasn't so much a trial run for Popeye as an experiment to see what was possible. Someone got the bright idea to militarize it later. Why was India used? Again, like so many things in the 60s, science and the Cold War got mixed together. The US was trying to defuse the tensions between India and Pakistan while also trying to bring them into the US sphere of influence. This was done, partly with economic aid. For India, struggling to feed its people, a project to increase rainfall seemed perfect. This was done with the consent and knowledge of the Indian govt. The best online narrative I can find about it comes from Prometheus Unleashed: Science as a Diplomatic Weapon in the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration, pages 13-26. 

Here we see the beginnings of the Cold War idea that if you're anti-Communist, you're a potential US ally. That it's better to support a fascist dictatorship than to risk a left-leaning democratically elected government. Sir Victor Mallet, British Ambassador to Spain, wrote 

Melting in the Arctic will not directly help finding the ships as they are likely sunk or stripped by locals for their metals. Arctic resource exploration may cause them to be found simply for the greater number of people poking around with instruments up there. HMS Investigator, a ship lost searching for Franklin, was found by Parks Canada in 2010 by sonar. It was found 11 meters underwater and partially buried in silt. This suggests maybe Erebus and Terror will be found, except for one key difference: the captain and crew of Investigator survived. Parks Canada knew what had happened to her, and knew roughly where to search. Parks Canada Expedition mounted a search for Erebus and Terror in August 2013. I haven't been able to find a report. UPDATE The 2014 Victoria Strait Expedition found one of them, not sure which yet. 

The Germans weren't broadly more inventive than the British or the Americans. What they did have is different national priorities and desperation for wonder weapons to win the war which lead them down paths the Allies didn't bother with. Couple this with madmen in control of national budgets and they'd fund all sorts of crackpot ideas. Few worked out. Mostly they were a waste of war resources. We tend to fixate on the fastest and biggest weapons: the biggest tanks, the fastest jets and rockets. But wars aren't won by wonder weapons, they're won by efficient weapons. It doesn't matter who invented it first, or who had a flashy prototype like so many German inventions during the war. The weapon has to work and you have to be able to produce it without bankrupting the country. The Greeks invented the steam engine, but it took 1700 years for it to be made practical. The Germans had all sorts of ideas about space, but it took 20-30 years and large chunks of the budgets of two superpowers to make just some of them happen and the rest are still on the table. The really hard part of invention is making it reliable and economical. It takes a lot of time, a lot of money, and a lot of people. The Allies were well ahead of the Germans in computers, signal intelligence, radar, electronic miniaturization and nuclear weaponry. The Germans were well ahead in rocketry and in jets by about a year because they were a national priority. Let's look at them in some detail.
