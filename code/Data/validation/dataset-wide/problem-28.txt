However, this is a bare minimum. If the size is much less, you won't last 5 hours. The FEMA recommendation is 10ft2 per adult for 5 hours. Given that air is 21% oxygen, this comes to $8.3 \times 0.21 = 1.74$ square feet for 5 hours. Using more appropriate numbers, this is $1.74 \times 8 = 13.92$ cubic feet for 5 hours, and $13.92 \div 5 = 2.78$ cubic feet per hour. That sounds like a fairly reasonable number: what output would you need? $$ (2.78 \div 21) \times 100 = 13.23 $$ This line shows that 2.78 cubic feet per hour of oxygen equates to 13.23 cubic feet per hour of normal air. $$ (13.23 \div 60) \div 60 = 0.003675 $$ This is the amount of air that your concentrator needs to take in per second to keep you alive. That's a perfectly good number: given that many home fans can move around 2 cubic feet of air per second, a commercial fan in a concentrator will have no trouble. A unit capable of doing this takes up less than 1 square metre. Grow lots of plants According to NASA, the average human needs 0.84kg of oxygen each day to survive. This can be produced by any size plants, but the space requirement changes depending. For example, a mature broadleaf tree such as an oak produces 10-15kg of oxygen per day, plenty to support a human. However, it can easily take up 20 square metres of space and can reach up to 30m high. Smaller plants may be easier: since they produce less oxygen, you can use a more exact number to produce closer to the right amount of oxygen per day, saving space. However, keep in mind that an exercising human uses much more oxygen - up to 7kg per day. The really easy way is to just pull in air from outside. However, this may not be possible, so your best bet is probably the filter, as it takes up the least space. 

The idea is that if more than one person has at least a basic level of understanding of each language, they may be able to facilitate communication. Unfortunately, it looks like these people won't get the chance to fully develop a new language - that takes hundreds to thousands of years, and they don't seem to have a viable gene pool to sustain a society. However, discounting that, the language they eventually develop by miscommunications, signing, botched explanations, facial expressions, body language and all those factors will be one of the most diverse languages the world has ever seen, taking its influences from all these different places. 

I can see a few methods: 1. Cremation This is already a popular method of dealing with your body when you've passed on (at least here in the UK). A furnace doesn't take up much space, and especially on a ship where you have huge amounts of power, it certainly won't take up much of it. You could then drop the ashes out into space - one astronomer is doing this with Pluto - but you have to decide whether that's ethical or not: is it polluting the Universe? 2. Cryogenic freezing We do already have the technology to do this one. When someone dies, you can give them a coffin, a funeral, and then put the coffin in a cryogenic freezing unit until you get to your destination. The big disadvantage of this is that it does take up a lot of space - with that many people on board, you're going to need a big room to keep all these dead people in. And of course, it'll be a lot of work to get them all off the ship when you get to your chosen planet. 3. Sanitary Vacuum Disposal System Also known as "throwing bodies out into space", this method is the simplest: after the funeral, you stick the body in an airlock and open the outside, thus letting them fly off into space. This might actually appeal to some people because of the almost romantic ideology that your dead relatives are out there somewhere, watching over you - in this case they really are out there. However, this does again have the problem of are you polluting space? 

There are also a number of other factors including atmospheric temperature and pressure, but they have a lesser effect - they only inflict small changes on the other major effects. Atmospheric Composition The composition of the atmosphere affects the colour of the sky by refracting, reflecting, and deflecting the Sun's light. Each chemical compound in the atmosphere refracts light differently; on Earth it is just the case that blue light gets refracted the most. The more a colour of light gets refracted, the more of it there appears to be in the sky (because it's spread out), so it becomes the color we see in the sky. Let us be clear on this point: the colours of the compounds themselves has no effect. Unless there is such a huge amount of a compound as to be clearly visible to the human eye, the colour of any molecule doesn't affect the colour of the sky. There is chlorine gas in our atmosphere; the sky doesn't appear green. Light For the sky to have any colour, there has to be some light. If there is no light, the atmospheric compounds cannot refract it and create colour. This is clearly demonstrated on Earth: at night, the sky is dark - because there is no light coming through the atmosphere to get refracted. The hue of the light also has an effect. If, for example, the Sun didn't output any blue light, the sky would not be blue because there would be no blue light to refract. The hues of the refracted light mix together to create the colour of the sky - if red and yellow are refracted most, you will end up with an orange sky. Changing Sky Colour To change the colour of the sky on your world, simply change the light that's hitting the atmosphere, or change the atmospheric composition. The atmosphere's total refractive index is what determines what light is refracted most. The Earth's refractive index is close to 1: if it increased, the sky would tend towards the red end of the spectrum; if it decreased we'd tend towards ultraviolet. See Also Atmospheric Refraction Atmosphere of Earth List of refractive indices 

However, there may be a way. Have the AIs the opposite way around - most intelligent first. Subject the AI on the top to millenia of Matrioshka treatment. Then put it in charge as "just another part" of the treatment. If your Matrioshka premise works, this AI doesn't let the chains go and the others can't outsmart it. The Biggest Problem I think you've already hit it. The problem here is how to organise the AIs to make sure they can't be let loose. (Here is the point where everyone points out that AI will not necessarily go rogue - I know, I'm assuming worst case scenario). Oooh. Something else that just came to me on my second read through. The CEV idea. While that's a brilliant idea in principle, there are plenty of other AI questions, comments and answers on this site that explain that even the most benign goal can cause destruction to humanity. Will It Work? Ah, the big one. I have to say - I don't know. The most plausible way of making it work that I've come up with is the one I explained above - but even that relies on your Matrioshka idea working. The only alternative I can see is for the difference in intelligence between each AI to be negligible - but that means hundreds or millions of AIs. For the sake of a definitive answer, I'll say yes - the Matrioshka idea seems sound to me so if applied correctly, should work. My One Improvement I'd have to say I'd make the system as I explained in the first point. Have the intelligent AI first. And then I'd spend years and trillions on making damn sure that I've got that "q-constraining" right. Let's see - if your AI is self-improving, there's a chance that it will see that as a restriction and remove it - but it's the part that this system is based on, it's why it works. If they remove that - 100 rogue super-powerful computers, anyone? And the most intelligent doesn't know who's real and who's not? So, you need to make absolutely sure that the self-improvement of the self-improvement routine that self-improves the AI can't possibly self-improve enough to see the q-constraint as counter-improvement and then go and self-improve it. Because that, my friends, would be bad. 

Please note: RCSA does not deal with terraforming or infrastructure setup on the target planet. However, I imagine you could also fly a supply ship over and some other skilled robots to help. Colonisation Systems, Inc. does not accept liability for any lack of simulation or consideration of required emergency features by You. The simulation list We provide may not be exhaustive. 

You're right in that things like gold would be more common in space (it's rare on Earth because the Sun doesn't produce it, for the most part). So, in theory, the most valuable elements would be the heaviest. To be on the safe side, say the most valued would be after actinium, and obviously I can't say exactly which element would be most rare because of the slightly random distribution. However, if you base off these theories, you should be reasonably sure of it. However, you will also need to note that value depends not just on rarity and supply of an element, but also on demand (thanks to Philipp for bringing this up). If, for example, uranium and einsteinium are both very rare, but there is a higher demand for einsteinium, then it will be the more valuable of the two because suppliers will recognise the market and push prices up. 

Suppose that, while the British were busy making their empire, someone in government discovered magic and let his colleagues in on the secret. However, the magic they have discovered is fairly limited. There is no mind-reading, telekinesis is limited to small objects such as pens, and personal augmentative magic such as giving yourself super speed or strength is impossible. What the government suddenly can do is two things:
