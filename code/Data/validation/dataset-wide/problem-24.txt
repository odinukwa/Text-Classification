Also more recently the Margolus-Levitin theorem states a limit dependent on energy (relevant for quantum computation): 

Lightning also oxidizes nitrogen in the air making nitrates which may lead to conditions more favorable to plant growth. It's a possibility that given enough time this hypothetical desert would became less barren although I do not have an opinion about what kind of plant life (inc. fungi). As an unrelated note on Lightning (but perhaps useful for people who wish to further explore lightning related phenomena in world building) check this. 

, notice, however, that all of this is still speculation and vague (and certainly not without exception). As so it's taken more as an argument and less as a fact. In any case we can speculate that if: 

None of the above state anything about the nature of "intelligence" because this is concept without any conclusive and definitive explanation. We are unable to reproduce a brain by design. In any case studies in neuroscience seem to show that: 

Steppe peoples used yurts on wheels and tent cities. So have armies, and medieval tents could be very large and multi-room, albeit with a whole lot of interior poles and trusses. For your large buildings, consider the 1800s circus tent transported on wagons, not only the canvas but the king pole, half poles, quarter poles, and all the ropes and pegs, tools and seating to boot. Now, speed. The usual wagon animals on the steppe and in China were oxen. They are the strongest, so you need the fewest animals (which have to be fed grain on the march as there isn't time for them to graze. Crazy as it sounds, the Chinese ox drawn army travelled c. 3 miles per day. Horses and mules are faster, but you need 3 or 4 times as many. Look into gigantic English road waggons of the 1700s and early 1800s right before railroads. They made about 20 miles/day on good roads. So figure 10 m/d. This is a good walking speed for humans. Still, you will need advance parties to start out weeks early to put down depots for food, fodder, forage, and firewood for everyone else. 

like PVC would not have the necessary strength to resist either an inflation or an orbit maneuver for scales of that size. This means that if you pulled one part (or even several) of the plastic piece it would not move the entire piece. It would just rip apart. Assuming that this plastic piece was already somehow in place notice that 1 Bar is almost the pressure we have, on Earth, at sea level. This is quite a bit. For your structure to support itself without collapsing (it would be in free fall after all) it would need to orbit the moon at speeds far from Selenosynchronous orbit requirement (I doubt 8000 meters is enough). In any case this isolation "plastic" would rip apart with the forces produced by the speed difference between plastic surface and moon surface. I do not think you can get away with using such a conventional material, or such a simplistic (one piece?) structure, for such an unconventional use. Neither the implementation or maintenance would work. Off the top of my head I would say the deterioration would be immediate. I think pursuing this idea in similar molds to the ones you have stated would require other type of structure (or composition of structures). 

If there isn't a lot of water, you will not have a city. You will have a fortified caravanserai with wells inside the walls, mostly empty space for the travelers with the necessary number of guards and a director. They may use the roofs to grow feed for the animals. You will need these spaced about one day's travel apart. The animals you describe are implausible for deserts. Desert animals are lean and lanky to lose excess heat easily, with enough hair to stave off sunburn but not so much as to make them hot. Consider the difference between the Arctic fox and the desert fox, or between the Bactrian (cold weather) and dromedary (hot desert) camel. Also, anything very gigantic is going to find it impossible to traverse ergs (sand dune areas): it will sink right in when it tries to climb. It would be restricted to rocky desert areas. Look at the oasis cities of the Garamantes as your models: they were a culture in the middle of the Sahara. But each one needed the springs of an oasis to exist. Large predators are normally very rare in desert conditions. There isn't enough large prey to support them. "Desert wolves" are normally semi-desert wolves that live on antelope and wild asses that live on the scrub. They would have no reason to risk their lives going into the true desert unless they got the timetable on when caravans were coming through and knew they could probably score a meal. If they normally go after migrating herds, you have an excuse for them being there. Now, about city layout. Most people have a funny idea that a medieval walled city is like a neolithic walled village: houses packed cheek to jowl and the tiniest possible wall around it. Not so. The problem is that most people are thinking of the 19th C remains of 12th C cities. Land was so valuable that everything was overbuilt. Back in the day, city walls were built as large as possible, and buildings clustered along the streets leading from the gates to the city center. Back from there, houses had gardens, and there was wasteland along the walls for riding academies, dairy farms, and stonecutters. There were orchards inside cities. Under these circumstances, there will have to be enough land allotted per person to support them with a garden (yes, rich people buy land and get bigger, but maybe allocation isn't capitalistic)(in which case, rich people pay the poor ones to do the weeding). Meat sources are likely to be birds with clipped wings (chickens, pigeons), small mammals (guinea pigs, rabbits), and omnivores that can eat the trash (pigs). Pigs may be branded then let loose to be the street cleaners. This was normal in Colonial America. People may brand their date palms. Simply, you have to make living here a paying proposition for the inhabitants, or they will move somewhere else. Plausibly, they don't stay somewhere because an author tells them to. You have to give them a means to scrabble through and a reason to put up with the hardship. 

There are speculated limits for computation, notably the Bekenstein bound for information storage and Bremermann's limit for maximum computational speed of a self contained system. The latter assumes: 

A lodestone can attract iron and - I speculate - could in time, given an extreme frequency of lightning strikes, lead to abnormal concentration of iron (perhaps darker patches on the floor surrounded by a sandy color?). This is not totally unheard as can be seen by the existence of desert varnish (although mind the origin). 

Apart from the, already mention in comments, creation of fulgurite the lightning discharge also produces a very strong magnetic field that is believed to be the origin of lodestones (a naturally magnetized magnetite). Magnetite itself is typically found in beach sand (mostly likely transported trough erosion). 

, are the most relevant sectors in this notion of dependence (and by the way those three sectors are actually most of the human brain) than we could hypothesize that both information retention and emotional stimulus are significant for the concept of intelligence. So potentially the Bekenstein bound could be a physical limit to intelligence. As a final comment notice that most of the resources linked in the text above are mostly of philosophical nature. I think we are far away from having (from the science point of view) a reasonable answer for your question. 

Historically, there were western European settlements only accessible from the sea. You had a wilderness trek to get there by land, and medievals mostly hated wilderness. The forest will get pushed back as it is used for lumber (boatyards), firewood, and fields to grow food. 

3) Satellites: easy to fool with an image perpetuated from just before the attack. Project it above the site so the satellites perceive it as the actual surface. Only has to last 24-48 hours. They may want to spend 24 hours hovering to take a full noon-to-noon cycle to cover the night changes in artificial lighting. 2) Choice of country can make all the difference. The more wired the country, the more mobile the population, the more outsiders will notice the lack of Facebook updates or be more likely to drive to through. It has to be off regular rail or air service, only a weekly or biweekly at best. Of course, villages are easier. But I think you want the largest place they can get away with, right? Otherwise they could avoid destructions and set up in the middle of uninhabited nowhere at leisure. So what are the human facilities they need out of the village/town that they can't get at some deserted lake in northern Canada? How is a rural village in Nigeria or a small town in the Philippines any better? 1) Timing is critical. If it's a ski resort, don't hit on a February weekend. Look for when it is most deserted, with the fewest outsiders coming in. Not on a convention weekend. Major cities and capitals are off the list. I'm seeing a seaside resort in off season, still cold if not snowy, and a major storm (blizzard, sleet, rain) may have knocked out communications normally in the area. This question is going to take people from all over piling on with their suggestions of a good town in their area that suits the shopping list. This could probably be best as a separate question: this is my set-up; what towns in your knowledge would you suggest? Otherwise, you get to invent a place. Some small towns get most of their traffic on weekends, with the weeks isolated. Some act as bedroom communities, with lots of commuting on the weekdays but people stay home and mow the lawns on the weekend. Do you have a positive or negative preference in continents or countries for the setting? Like, you just don't think you can handle the cultural differences of setting this in the USA or Mongolia or wherever? Obviously, this target must be within fleeing distance of the second town where the survivor goes. On foot, maybe thirty miles in two days (assuming he isn't an ultra-marathoner). On horse, maybe seventy miles if he got a good one. On bicycle? Moped? Motorcycle? What will he find to use?
