Colour is both intrinsic to an object & extrinsic to it. It is intrinsic to it simply because when you look at a purple cabbage the colour purple inheres in that cabbage. One might call this disparagingly the common-sense view. Nagarjuna, the Buddhist philosopher would call it the conventional view or reality. Starting with Aristotle attributes of an object were distinguished - primary & secondary. Colour is a secondary characteristic & mass for example is primary. This is all really about the theory of substance starting from Aristotle but going back to the line of investigation started by Milisian materialists as how to account for change & stability. Colour is a secondary characteristic because when I boil a cabbage the colour leaks away, but the mass of cabbage remains - it is primary; or when I view through blue glass the colour changes but the mass again remains the same. (Arguably, the very nomenclature here priviliges the discourse of no-change of Parmenides, for Heraclitus one could speculate would have the named them oppositely; change being primary, and no-change secondary). In modern science, the idea of colour is fractured. It is the response of the colour cones in the retina of your eye that stimulates your colour response. Or perhaps its that particular frequency of light that enters your eye. But that particular frequency of light has been modified by being reflected & scattered from the surface of the purple cabbage. Finally, when you dream or hallucinate of purple cabbage are your colour cones being stimulated? Is then not colour your own mental response? Science examines the mechanism of colour, and mechanisms have many parts. Where you focus your examination biases ones view as to it being intrinsic or extrinsic. Is colour is a priori? Although we are primed to experience colour we cannot experience colour or know of it until we know of the world. In this sense again colour appears to be a secondary phenomena. Kant I suppose would call this an empirical concept of the understanding in its objective sense and possibly a priori synthetic in the intuitive faculty. 

Can arithmatic when codified by the first-order Peano Axioms recreate the transfinite (cardinal) hierarchy of Set Theory (ZFC)? I suspect not, simply because we have no formal means of creating a set - and so we cannot even take the first step to define cardinality. How about 2nd-order Peano Axioms, I suspect here it can (but am not sure), as in the introduction of the previous article we have: 

Again he's well aware of the falsity of this view; that is if it is taken as a clear-cut move; his views are, to use a Hegelian term, sublated: when his thinking moves into a new area, something of the old is kept. Much more can be said; but you need to read and look widely; and assimilate it so that responses are fluid; this, unfortunately takes work. 

Zeno famously said an arrow cannot be in motion as it occupies some precise position at some precise time. And is thus at rest. Modern physics resolves this by stating the arrow has momentum. It is its momentum that carries from one place to another. At any precise time it has a specific velocity. So it is not at rest. To simplify our presentation let us reduce the arrow to a point, and suppose it to move in a straight line with no forces acting on it. One then can identify the continua of time with the continua of the line. So motion is time. And time is motion. But it seems to me that the paradox of rest remains. Which in this pictures is this. That a continuum of only points is actually not a continuum. There is no cohesion. Modern studies of the real line remove this paradox by stipulating that a topology is present and this binds together points. One of course then notices that the points are actually not neccessary, only the continuum itself, that is the topology. That is pointless topology (pun presumably intended by the author of the coinage). This then removes Zenos first prescription to be able to specify an exact moment in time. In this picture this cannot be done. But if one wishes to retain points, one could try a different logic, say by saying the point is both a point and not a point - this resolves to false in classical logic, but if one drops the law of the excluded middle, then this is not so. Following this line of thought for intuitionistic logic, gives the notion of the rigid, infinitesimal line. Which is not a point - it is a line, but it is also a point - it is infinitesimal. Does this work as a solution towards resolving Zenos paradox? 

Reductionism, which understands higher order descriptions in terms of lower order descriptions, can't be understood without Emergentism - how higher order descriptions arise from lower order descriptions. This is the movement, for example, that is described in Hegels Logic. Or for example, the bulk properties of matter from microscopic ones, which is described by statistical mechanics. 

Additionally, in his Physics he argues that material change is accidental, it is varying form - there is an underlying substance (that must be thought together with form). Today we would call that matter-energy. It is starting from here that one begins to think about attributes - that is predicates, and existence. Is a substance defined by all of its attributes? Is there a bare substance devoid of any attributes? Etc. There is a long development that then goes through both Western Philosophy/Christian Theology. Spinoza for example said that God was the only Substance with an infinite number of modes - one being mental the other extension. This reconciles Descartes dualism, and asserts that existence of the mental & extension is contingent - that is on God. This has many parallels with Occasionalism a doctrine of the Ash'arite school of Islamic Philosophy/Theology, particularly developed by Al-Ghazali. Hume being a radical empiricist denied the reality of substances - it cannot be perceived. For an alternative understanding of this long development, one could turn towards Buddhism, especially in Nagarjunas formulation. Here the idea of substance as begun by Aristotle is rejected in its entirety. Existence, in the Western sense, they would argue has no meaning - 'the essenceless of no essence'. So, In SHORT, I think you've misunderstood Ayer. His 'thing' should be substance. Kant is pointing this distinction out because he is contra Hume who explicitly denies the existence of substances but believes in attributes. I think one should note that in the short extract that you've given Ayer shortcuts Kants reasoning - assenting to Kants 'existence is not an attribute' does not mean that one covertly assigns an existence to a substance once one asserts an attribute. Looking over The SEPs entry on Substance one sees that: 

According to Julian Barbour Discovery of Dynamics, Aristotle disguised between an objective and 'potential' reality. I've put the latter in quotes as I don't recall the term for it. In potential reality, contradictions are obtainable. In objective reality, not so, and the classical laws of logic obtain. It seems to me that for hypotheses to be falsifiable they must be about objective reality where we can distinguish between p & not p objectively. That there is something in this is shown in QM where it is possible for both p and not p to hold. For example, the spin of an electron can be potentially up and down. Yet in actuality, when we come to measure it, we only find it is either up or down and not both. We can only measure an objective reality, we can however infer a potential reality of which we cannot make direct hypotheses because we don't have direct access to it. Heisenberg found these notions of Aristotle important enough to acknowledge it in writing, referring to potentia and actualite. It's important to note - as Barbour does - that Aristotle used these concepts in his theory of motion, which was developed in in an effort to solve Zenos paradox. And what is QM, but like every theory in physics, a theory of motion. 

It's clear and evident that no particular place in space is special, and nor any particular direction. It is also true (ignoring relativity) that there is no absolute rest; we cannot determine whether a particle is at rest. Is this tied to the fact that there is no fixed origin of space? Ie conceiving space as a Cartesian grid then there is a point of origin of the axes; but in actual fact there is no such place. For supposing that there is such a place, then given a particle in that space we can measure the distance of the particle from it with time; and if this doesn't change we can say the particle is at rest. Is this a good argument? (In Aristotelian terms we can say that every Place the particle can occupy is identical). 

The model that Laplace was probably contemplating was Newtonian Mechanics; this theory is deterministic, so he was simply dramatising or even melo-dramatising via his demon the notion of determinism implicit in this theory. As the character in this drama is a demon rather than an angel suggests that he supposes that there is something not quite right here, after all we experience the world as a mixture of neccessity and freedom. 

Hence the laughter provoked by comedy, according to Aristotle, is not that which provokes our pity; but where we recognise meanness or lowness of spirit. 

I have a purpose, an end to which I aim at; but I am also a part of nature, a fragment of the universe. So in my being can I say the universe has a purpose? To clarify: I follow, or rather am the expression of my will. That is my will is my law - the law that I follow. My will is my purpose. An electron as it leaps from one orbit to another follows a law. This law is its purpose. The universe is full of purposes - none of which is substitutable for each other - despite there being family resemblences - and at some level those substitutions can be made. One worker for another is substitutable - but not in themselves - in the world that they carry. Or one electron for another, but in themselves, in the history that they carry - their world - they're not substitutable either. So the world is a multiplicity of purposes in its inner sense. To see the world have no purpose is to see the world in its outer sense only. The universe, the world is an outer expression of all these wills - they are a representation of it as such. On reflection, these ideas look Schopenerian to some extent. 

Descartes innovation here, his famous cogito, is to fill in a gap in this argument (preceding the last sentence); but this leads later to a distinction, as in Kant, between the phenomenal world of appearances; and the things themselves, though affirmed, are shrouded behind a veil. Over-coming this dichotomy has been a strong theme in early continental philosophy; it motivated the development of Phenomenology, by Husserl - whose slogan was: 

So he's calling for a more balanced, nuanced and even-handed way at looking at the what's happening to the environment and not simply 'giving up'. 

There can be no manifest infinities in the world to the naked senses; thus the infinite is at an infinite distance from this world. 

Now, I take the term that translates grundsein in English to be Being-the-basis. This is quite an ugly expression in English; I mean it's not natural; but somehow it seems more natural in German; thus it might be simply my lack of familiarity with the language. First, is modern German more at ease than English at agglutinating words to create neologisms? And is this one reason for the strangeness of a Heideggers speech - and perhaps earlier, Hegel? Further, given Heideggers fascination with the world of antiquity, was Ancient Greek also more at ease with agglutinated words - and Heidegger simply mimic'd this. Sanskrit, is quite happy with agglutinated words, and even whole phrases; so can push this a little further and say that agglutinated sppech might mark philosophical speech in Antiquity? 

You have two questions here, which don't really relate to each other. It may be worth asking two seperate ones. I'll answer the first here. Pierces law states: ((p implies q) implies p) implies p This is equivalent to the law of the excluded middle in propositional logic. One can prove this by using truth tables (a la Wittgenstein). First observes the truth table for material implication: 

I've made the same argument 'provocatively' (in order to point out the continuing relevance/interest of the philosophy of antiquity); but in actual fact, Lucretious endows his particles with the swerve so that they can interact ie collide - I'm not sure, that there is any argument for (or against) free will in de Rerum Natura - or at least, I can't recall one. It's worth pointing out here, that Aristotle, though noting the very real successes of the atomic theory of Democritus & Leucippus in dismissing the paradoxes of both Parmenides and Zeno, had missed the full import of Zenos Paradoxes; the classical conception of motion in Antiquity - the notion on which our classical notion of physics is built - he notes, 'isn't adequate'. 

This is not a million miles away from Descartes 'clear and distinct ideas'; and nor is it a million miles away from your 'building on intuitive ideas'. H goes on to say: 

Does this work, or be made to work? (Assuming of course that this the same paradox that we now know by the name of Russell). some defintions from Russells introduction: From Russells introduction: a. A propositional function is a function whose values are propositions; for example 'x is human'. b. A truth-function of a proposition p is a proposition containing p and such that its truth or falsehood depends only upon the truth or falsehood of p. c. Wittgenstein shows every propositional function is a truth-function. 

Actually, this is inline with Badious picture of philosophy, which is not a truth-procedure; but is allied with them. It's one reason, why, Zizek calls B, perhaps a mite hyperbolically, a new Plato... 

How does a formal essence have presence - should it not be, perhaps material essence? Or does this simply mean that the essence of a signifier, is purely formal; finally, what does Derrida mean by presence here? 

Surely order, and the stability of that order is neccessary for a measurement to occur? This seems to be at least a precondition for most sciences. After all, if I measure a shoe, and it's 30cm long; and then again and it's 33cm, and then again and find it's no longer a shoe but an elephant - it's would seems then no measurement is made possible. 

2-logics quantify over predicates, 3-logics over predicates of predicates and so on. Unlike 1-logic where we have nice meta-logical properties of soundness, completeness & effectiveness - these properties fail for higher logics. But they're reobtained if instead of using full semantics we use Henkin semantics where the quantifiers are bounded. This means they reduce to typed 1-logic. Consider the statement: Beethoven has all the properties that make for a great musician. Surely, here one needs to restrict to properties that are applicable to human beings and not say to the moon for example? Does this mean that typed 1-logic is more natural than just 1-logic? We have nice meta-logic properties, plus the expressibility of higher logics. For example stating the least upper bound property for the reals is not possible in 1-logic, but it is in 2-logic. Is there a strong argument for considering 1-logic more fundamental than typed 1-logic?
