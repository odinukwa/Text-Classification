I've got a Cambelbak MULE which has about 11l of pack capacity. I found that this is quite enough for day-long rides, far from any roads. I packed: 

This is a usual issue if the bearings in the steering tube are overtightened. Re-adjust the bearing (or take it back to the shop) and you're good to go. 

If you're that concerned with lost air and exact pressures, get Schrader valves on your bike and buy a shock pump like the Scott Shock Pump Pro 600, which lets you close the valve before disconnecting the hose. Other than that - if you're not far heavier than 100kg, it doesn't really matter whether you have six or eight or twelve bar in the tubes when it comes to puncture safety. In those pressure ranges it's just a matter of rolling resistance and comfort. The former optimizes somewhere around 8bar, the latter decreases steadily with increasing pressure. 

My fullface helmet could be strapped to the outside on long ascents. If you're feeling adventurous, you'll even get full size shin/knee guards strapped to the side of the pack, but then it will be a little unwieldy. If you don't need to attach your helmet to the pack, you can roll up clothes and attach them around the sides and upper edge of the pack using the four compression straps. Beware of one thing: If you fill the bladder up to the maximum, the back of the pack will bulge out, reducing comfort. 

I should think that they only work in conjunction with a full face helmet in that the helmet's angular motion range (up, down, left/right tilt) is restricted in such a way that on crashing, the typical "break-neck" motion (sharp snap of the neck) is avoided. However, this is just an educated guess. 

If it's not too far, try Limburg and the region around Aachen in Germany. While you won't find hour-long ascents there, riding a lot of smaller hills up and down will keep you far more fit than riding one big ascent a day. 

This depends entirely on the lube. I use Finish Line Cross Country for all my bikes except the Velomobile, where I use a thinner lube because the chain is entirely inside the fairing. Normally, I'll just dry off the chain after riding in the rain or clean it with warm water if mud is involved and dry it afterwards. Before the next ride (best the evening before) I check whether the chain is dry. If my fingers get (a little!) oily, everything's fine, otherwise, I relube. The relube intervals depend of course on riding frequency, but my commuting bike gets a relube every couple of weeks, even though I leave it outside while at work. 

They make the bike look more shiny than you want, attracting all kinds of unwanted attention. I ride my commuter bike in any weather without too much maintenance. Should the carbon rim fail at some point, I at least won't notice a hairline crack until the wheel breaks. Carbon wheels will mostly break catastrophically, and that's not what I'd want while wedged between an SUV and a 40-ton lorry. If you're using rim brakes (which the OP doesn't), pure carbon rims do not have the same braking performance as alloy ones, especially when wet. With a seller on eBay, you probably don't have anyone to go to if the wheel is faulty from the start, e.g. arrives broken/bent or some such. Basically, you don't get any warranty. 

In german this is called "Hinterrad versetzen" -- "displacing the back wheel". I got to learn this in an mtb course I took a while back. If you can, try to find an instructor or other experienced rider to teach you. How to practice: Start very, very small and always wear full protective gear, i.e. a full-face helmet and vest in case you crash. You will crash. Be prepared. Have a friend with you just in case. Look for an open, empty and even space like a parking lot or similar where you can brake without fear of slipping. If possible, avoid concrete or similar very hard surfaces. First, you practice the stoppie, without turning. Start small, i.e. just lift your back wheel a couple of centimetres. You don't need to ride very fast, it's mostly about the balance on the bike. It's absolutely possible to do this from a walking pace. Instead of moving your weight far back, as you normally would in a hard stop, keep it (more or less) in front. Find the point where it's easy to lift the back wheel without getting the feeling you will crash any moment. Do this a couple of times. Slowly increase the height of the back wheel. Do only the stoppie until you feel comfortable "standing on your front wheel" for a second or two without losing control. If you feel safe holding the stoppie, try pushing your back wheel around a couple of centimetres by letting the inertia turn the bike. You need only provide the tiniest motion yourself, physics will do the rest. Slowly increase the arc until you are where you want to be. Note 1. If you have front suspension, beware of your fork kicking back when in the stoppie. This can easily overturn you. Note 2. I wouldn't try this on stairs or a rocky or otherwise dangerous path until I was absolutely sure I can do it. Also, don't force it. Practicing this kind of thing takes time and drains you faster than you think. Try integrating training into normal rides instead of riding out just to train. 

You can simply add a cheap chain tensioner and be done with it. The chain line will most likely not be ideal anyway if you left the entire cassette on there, so that shouldn't be a concern. 

I suggest getting neoprene covers for shoes and/or neoprene socks, which keep your feet warm even if they get wet from melting snow/slush from the road. If you ride clipless, make sure to get some insulation between the bolts for the pads and your feet. My SPD shoes have a metal plate on the inside that gets quite cold while riding. I had Pearl Izumi lobster gloves when I rode to school/uni on a daily basis and they're really quite warm. But beware: These kinds of gloves need to really fit, so you need to try them on in conditions most similar to your hand position on the bike. Especially if the fingers are too short, they will get cold and/or painful very fast. Beware of motorists! Most of them overestimate their tyre's capacity to handle snow/ice. Also beware of sharp corners, depressions in the road where water may collect etc. An accident in this kind of weather, even if the injuries are minor, is very, very bad. Lying on the ground even for only a few minutes will pose a major health risk. 

The fork is fitted the wrong way around. The brake caliper should be in front of the fork, not behind it. The way it is, the bike will be very, very hard to ride because of the negative rake, making it very nervous. The negative rake is also the reason for the pedal overlap. Normally, you should at most get some toe overlap. Loosen the bolt in the top of the stem, turn the fork around 180 degrees (it will only go clockwise because of the brake cable to the front brake) and tighten the bolt when the stem and wheel are aligned.
