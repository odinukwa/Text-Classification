To answer the question reworded as: "What limits the quality of telescopes currently?" The answer is mostly: money. It used to be: atmosphere. But with advances in adaptive optics, ground-based telescopes are achieving what used to require a space telescope. Plus, we have the technology for space telescopes if we want, like the pending JWST. So pretty much, it boils down to funding. Who is going to spend the money on the expensive technology to see better and further, when science is being squeezed for funding from all quarters, and astronomers can't put forward a business case for a return on investment like a biotech company can for developing a grass that will result in cows burping less methane. 

We could not have formed "outside" the expanding universe, as there would not be any substance to form our galaxy, and solar system -including our Sun and planet. 

This is how the differences between adjacent pixels would be calculated (I'm assuming only horizontal and vertical differences, not diagonal): 

It looks like this for me because I am at 43 south. If I was at the equator, the moon would appear to have rotated 180 as it travelled from horizon to horizon. It is easier to think about on the equator. Say the moon rises, and you consider the bit at the top to be "up". It continues on up, right over your head, and down to the horizon... But on the way down, the "up" side of the moon is now looking down. It was "up" until the zenith, but then it is "down" all the way to the horizon. It doesn't rotate at all, but the result is a 180 degree flip in appearance from horizon to horizon. Or consider the perspective at a pole, while the moon is up. The moon travels right around the sky, always facing the same direction, with no apparent rotation (and while it is up, no moonrise or moonset, it is up all day). Latitudes in between see an in-between effect; some apparent rotation of the moon between moonrise and moonset. 

Meeus' work (second link) mentions the 13425 CE event in "Table 1. Simultaneous and near-simultaneous transits of Mercury and Venus, years 1 to 300,000" Within the limits of DE431 (7 May 13201 BCE to 7 May 17091 CE), there is no time at which both Mercury and Venus transit the Sun. The closest we get to this: 

As noted in $URL$ the length of sunrise/sunset varies from approximately 128/cos(latitude) seconds at the equinoxes to approximately 142/cos(1.14*latitude) at the solstices. More specifically, here's the length of sunrise/sunset at various latitudes: 

state that UTC advanced from being 0.085272 seconds behind UT1 on 30 Dec 2015 to being only 0.083475 behind UT1 on 31 Dec 2015. That means UTC advanced on UT1 by 0.085272 minus 0.083475 (equals 0.001797) seconds. In other words, the rotation period from 30 Dec 2015 to 31 Dec 2015 was 86400.001797 seconds. Once the predicted UTC is more than 0.5 seconds ahead of UT1, a leap second will be announced for the following June 30th or December 31st. 

This isn't really an answer, but more of a visualization (click for full size of 1024x768) based on the formulas from Need Simple equation for Rise, Transit, and Set time -- hope it helps 

and looking at the second sentence, we have "they do not revolve around the same poles [...] but follow the oblique ecliptic". Assuming the use of poles later in the page is the same, he's pointing out the north ecliptic pole (which is in Draco) is not the same as the north celestial pole (which is in Ursa Minor and close to the star Polaris). 

So it doesn't matter where ANY of the hydrogen atoms are in the photosphere, they have next to no chance of actually hitting Earth with a photon that they emit. Even though there are a lot of them, they are ALL firing off photons in almost every direction EXCEPT towards Earth. 

Assuming that the glasses are safe for direct viewing of the sun as claimed, and assuming you don't damage them, then yes, they should be safe for viewing the sun daily in the manner you suggest. There would not be an accumulative harm effect. Again, assuming the glasses are safe for direct viewing, you'll probably be at more risk for the rest of the day when you are walking around with naked eyes. 

Yes, and no. yes, the equinox will drift over time, but the seasons will not invert every 13000 years. The reason is the calendar we use is already adjusting for most of the drift due to the precession of the equinoxes. In 10,000 years the drift in seasons will be only around 10 days. $URL$ 

Here is what one commentator has said about TESS in comparison to PLATO: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), to launch in 2017, seems superficially to be a similar mission to Plato. It will potentially discover hundreds of planets before Plato even gets off the ground in 2024. However, the limited sensitivity of its cameras mean it is completely blind to Earth-like worlds around sun-like stars. Astroseismology is also off-limits for TESS, meaning the size of any worlds it does discover will be highly uncertain. Unlike Plato, it will also move between patches of sky every 30 days, allowing only hot, short-period planets to be found. With all other new telescopes, both in space and on the ground, limited to finding super-Earths around small stars, Plato is the only mission on the table truly capable of discovering an Earth-like world around a star like our Sun. And by targeting bright stars that allow atmospheric follow-up, it is not impossible to think that, as well as the first truly habitable planet, Plato could find the first inhabited one too.

So it seems Europa's sky is fairly well lit, even at solar night. But don't get your hopes too high: I performed this simulation at the intersection of Europa's equator and prime meridian. An earlier simulation in the northern hemisphere showed that Jupiter doesn't rise at all there. 

I wrote $URL$ to solve this with the full results at: $URL$ As viewed from RigelKentaurusB, the Sun has magnitude 0.48, and is the 10th brightest star in the sky. This is the only star system with known exoplanets where the Sun even makes the top 10. From EpsilonEridani, the sun shines at magnitude 2.37, making it the 79th brightest star in their sky. Things go rapidly downhill from there: 

Notice that most of the parameters change only infinitesimally, since Mercury's orbit around the Sun is fairly stable (for a counterexample, see the Moon's orbit around the Earth, which varies quite a bit). As a note, I also thought it would be nice if the planets orbited the barycenter and did some work on it, but the numbers just don't work out: $URL$ 

which suggests the calculation is being done in arcminutes, not degrees. Unfortunately, this doesn't help, since the result is 76.5283 arcminutes, which is nowhere near 2 degrees 19 minutes 28 seconds (which is 139.467 arcminutes). 134*sin(0:32) may refer to 32 seconds of arc, and the result is 0.02 which is 1 minute or arc (0:01). Terrible use of notation here if that actually is the case. 

$URL$ gives G*m for the Sun as . $URL$ gives G as If these numbers were exact (they're not), the sun's mass (after converting m^3 to km^3 above) would be: 165890550052424250000000000000000000/83423 kg or about 1988546924138717739712069812881.3396785059276218789 kg or 1.9885469241387177397120698128813396785059276218789*10^30 kg Of course, that level of precision is ridiculously unwarranted, but I would argue that's the most precise value you can get, if you accept NASA's definitions of the sun's Gm and the universe's G. 

Your question presumes that the ISS is beyond Earth's gravity, that it has escaped earth's gravitational pull. This is not correct. All objects with mass in the universe affect all other things with mass in the universe, the effect just gets weaker with distance. So the ISS is feeling the effect of gravity from Earth significantly more than the moon is. The reason the ISS doesn't just fall to the earth, either directly or gradually spiralling towards the earth, is that it is travelling fast enough around the earth that it is continually "missing" earth. It is sometimes described as 'falling' constantly around earth. If I am to be properly correct though, the reality is that ISS is in fact falling towards the earth, getting closer and closer to Earth all the time. It needs occasional boosts to push it further back out in it's orbit. Just to blow your mind a little bit: The ISS is pulling on the Earth with the same force that the Earth is pulling on ISS. 

You are making the mistake of thinking that there was a single spot in space that everything expanded from. Rather, the expansion was not of things in space, it was space that expanded. It was an expansion OF space, not IN space. There wasn't "space" around the singularity. 

Your premise is incorrect. We used to think Mercury was tidally locked, but since 1965 we now know it is in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, which gives it (long) days. Anything you read that says it is tidally locked is old, or itself using old reference material. Here are some quick sketches to show the orbit, relative orientation of the planet, and the sidereal and solar days. If you like it as an answer I'll redraw with a graphics tool instead of my iPad Pen app... 

Assuming "will measure the positions" means "will measure the parallaxes", this appears to be referring to the final version of GAIA which will be published in the early 2020s. To make things easier, $URL$ has a "tgas_source" subdirectory which just includes the 2,057,066 stars for which there is additional data (so you don't have to download the entire much larger GAIA archive). 

You probably got this far yourself, but here is my absolutely wild speculative guess on why this could be 24 May 1587 on the Gregorian calendar: 

To a good approximation, the code above will tell you the longitude and latitude (in that order) where Pluto is currently overhead. You can edit it for different planets/times. 

I'm not sure this answers your question, but ICRF is a non-precessing reference frame. On J2000 (2000-01-01 12:00:00 UTC), the z axis of the ICRF frame was exactly parallel to a line connecting the Earth's center to the Earth's north pole. Since then, the Earth's north pole has precessed, so the ICRF z axis and the geocenter-north pole line are no longer parallel. To see this, you can visit $URL$ and use these settings: 

If you visit $URL$ you see several sky cultures that include various constellation shapes (you also get this directory when you download stellarium). As an example, lets look at $URL$ in particular the file $URL$ and line number 127 which reads: 

To get D, the number of days since the year 2000, I used Unix's date command as follows, and used other commands to finish the calculation: 

My version of Stellarium can't simulate the view from Naiad (Neptune's closest moon), but at a distance of only 48,227 km (Naiad's semi major axis), Neptune's magnitude would be almost -2, much fainter than our own moon, but brighter than Sirius appears to us. This brightness would be spread out across Neptune's disk, but the brightness at any point would be about magnitude 3, still quite visible. Moreover, Naiad probably has a much thinner atmosphere (and no light pollution), making Neptune even easier to see. The other outer planets are visible from Earth (Uranus just barely), and so would also be visible from their own moons. I haven't done the calculations for Pluto, which is technically no longer a planet. 

The LMC has an apparent size of about 645x550 arc mins, the SMC 320x205. Both contain several hundred million stars each. The LMC is about 14000ly in size, and is about 10 billion solar masses; the SMC is 7000ly in size, and is about 7 billion solar masses. The visual magnitude of the LMC is +0.28, the SMC is +2.23. Both feature a number of interesting clusters, nebulae, and supernova remnants. Notably, LMC is home to NGC 2070, the Tarantula Nebula, and Supernova 1987A. L The LMC is usually considered an irregular galaxy, though it has a prominent bar, somewhat warped, and a spiral arm. The SMC is a dwarf irregular galaxy, or maybe a barred disc. LMC is the fourth largest galaxy in our local group, and the third closest to us. SMC is the fifth? largest galaxy in the local group, and the fourth closest to us. {In a previous version of this response I said: A number of websites proclaim that the LMC and SMC are gravitationally bound to the Milky Way. This has been known to be incorrect since 2007 when Hubble observations showed they are travelling too fast to be orbiting the Milky Way. See also.} A number of websites proclaim that the LMC and SMC ARE gravitationally bound to the Milky Way. This was based on old information. More recent measurements have challenged this assumption, though further analysis has left open the door for the possibility that the LMC and SMC are gravitationally bound to the Milky Way. We can, however, safely say that the LMC and SMC may be gravitationally bound to the MW.
