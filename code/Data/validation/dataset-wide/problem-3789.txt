It depends on the conventions that you pick, but if you pick them correctly, you'll get what you want. First, for a normal linear functional $f$ on $B(H)$, there is a unique partial isometry $v\in B(H)$ and positive normal linear functional $|f|$ such that $f=v|f|$ and $v^*v$ is the support projection of $|f|$, where we use the convention that $v|f|(a) = |f|(av)$ for all $a\in B(H)$. See Theorem 4.3.2 of $URL$ for more details on this. Suppose $x\in B(H)$ is trace class, and consider the induced normal linear functional $f = \operatorname{Tr}(\,\cdot\,x)$ on $B(H)$. Now let's look at the polar decomposition of $x = u|x|$, which satisfies $\ker(u)=\ker(|x|)=\ker(x)$, so $u^*u$ is the support projection of $|x|$, and $u^*x=|x|$. Then $|x|$ induces a positive normal linear functional on $B(H)$, which we'll call $g$. One sees that for all $a\in B(H)$, \begin{align*} ug(a) &= g(au) = \operatorname{Tr}(au|x|)=\operatorname{Tr}(ax) = f(a) \\ u^*f(a) &= f(au^*) = \operatorname{Tr}(au^*x)=\operatorname{Tr}(a|x|) = g(a). \end{align*} Thus $ug = f$ and $u^*f = g$, so we see $$ g(a)=[u^*f](a)=[u^*(ug)](a)=[ug](au^*)=g(au^*u), $$ and $u^*u$ dominates the support projection of $g$. We easily verify that for all $b\in B(H)$, $$ g(b(1-u^*u))=\operatorname{Tr}(b(1-u^*u)|x|)=\operatorname{Tr}(b(|x|-u^*u|x|))=\operatorname{Tr}(b0)=0, $$ so $u^*u$ is exactly the support projection of $g$. This means that if $f=v|f|$ is the polar decomposition of $f$, then by the uniqueness of the polar decomposition, we must have that $|f|=g=\operatorname{Tr}(\,\cdot\,|x|)$ and $v=u$. 

There are $\binom{n}{k}$ ways to choose $k$ elements from $n$ elements. If we consider their sum it is "expected" to be equal to every element of the field with the same probability. Hence we get $\frac{1}{q}\binom{n}{k}$ for the number of solutions of $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = s$. This is the first part of your question. Now there are $\binom{q}{k}$ ways to choose $k$ different elements of the field. And $\frac{1}{q}$ of them have sum equal to $s$. In other words number of solutions of $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = s$ is equal to $\frac{1}{q}\binom{q}{k}$. If we choose random $D$ with $|D|=n$ every solution will have all $x_i \in D$ with the same probability $p$: $$p = \frac{\binom{q-k}{n-k}}{\binom{q}{n}}$$ Hence the expected number of solutions is equal to $\frac{1}{q}\binom{q}{k} \cdot p$ which is equal to $\frac{1}{q}\binom{n}{k}$. So the expected number of solutions is equal to $\frac{1}{q}\binom{n}{k}$. 

Yes, there is such scheme. It was recently suggested by Craig Gentry. Reference: "Fully Homomorphic Encryption Using Ideal Lattices" by Craig Gentry. $URL$ 

There is the following formula: $$ x_{n+2} = \frac{x_{n+1}^3}{2 x_{n}^2} + \frac{5}{2} x_n^2 x_{n+1} $$ I'm not sure if this is a pure recurrence formulae. If you need, I may provide a proof. 

@Todd Trimble is correct; a strict fusion category is just a fusion category that is strict as a monoidal category. (Being strict or being fusion is just a property of a monoidal category that can either hold or fail.) In particular, the pentagon axiom holds, where the associators are identities on the nose. Moreover, there is a version of MacLane's theorem for pivotal fusion categories, see Section 2 of arXiv:0503167v2. As someone who studies planar algebras, at one time I was very confused about this, and I think I know where the confusion lies. Let's focus on the fusion category $\operatorname{Vec}(G,\omega)$ where $\omega\in Z^3(G,\mathbb{C}^\times)$ is a cohomologically nontrivial 3-cocycle. The discussion below comes from a conversation I had with Scott Morrison which cleared up my confusion. We will give two realizations of the fusion category $\operatorname{Vec}(G,\omega)$. The first has only one representative for each isomorphism class of simple objects. There are exactly $|G|$ many 1-dimensional simple objects denoted $V_g$ for $g\in G$, with fusion rules given by $V_g \otimes V_h = V_{gh}$, and associator given by $$ (V_g\otimes V_h) \otimes V_k \xrightarrow{\omega_{g,h,k}} V_g\otimes (V_h\otimes V_k). $$ The associators are easily seen to satisfy the pentagon axiom because of the 3-cocycle condition. Now there's also a planar presentation of $\operatorname{Vec}(G,\omega)$. Usually, when we talk about a planar presentation, we're working with strict categories, because drawing strings next to each other in the plane is associative on the nose. (One can get around this by bending strings closer or further from other strings, or by drawing coupons for associators, but let's not do this here.) The category $\operatorname{Vec}(G,\omega)$ has a planar presentation via oriented strands labelled by group elements (considering an oriented label the same as the reverse orientation with the inverse label), trivalent vertices 

Is it true that every positive rational number $r = \frac{n}{m}$ could be represented as sum of $\frac{1}{k}$ for different $k$'s: $$ r = \sum_{i=1}^{s} \frac{1}{c_i} $$ where all $c_i$ are different? If true, are there any bounds on number of summands $s$ based on $n$ and $m$? 

You can use dynamic programming as you suggest in the title. Let $w_{ij}$ be the max gain you can get putting $j$ balls into first $i$ buckets. Then $w_{ij}$ has the following recursive relation: $$ w_{i,j} = \max_{0 \le t \le \min(N-1, j)}(w_{i-1,j-t} + \Delta l_{i, t}) $$ There $t$ is the number of balls you put into $i$-th bucket. Hence you can calculate $w_{K, \lambda}$ (your answer) in time $O(K \lambda N)$. 

Answer for the first question. Let $w_k$ be the product $p_{nk+1} p_{nk+2} \cdots p_{nk+n}$ where $p_i$ is $i$-th prime. So each $w_k$ is equal to product of $n$ distinct primes and $w_k$ and $w_q$ are coprime for $k \ne q$. Now take $t$ such that $t \equiv -k \pmod {w_k}$ for $k = 1, 2, \cdots, m$. Such $t$ exists by Chinese Remainder Theorem. Now $t + k$ has at least $n$ primes because $t + k$ is a multiple of $w_k$. Hence numbers $t + 1, t + 2, \cdots, t + m$ satisfy requirements in the first question. 

How (or if) a comparison principle works in the case of equations singular at some point? For example, I am analyzing a partial differential equation $$ \partial_{t}u=\partial_{rr}u+\frac{2}{r}\partial_{r}u-\frac{2}{r^{2}}u\quad u(0,t)=0,\quad \partial_{t}u(1,t)=0 $$ There is a family of stationary solutions $u_{a}(r)=a\cdot r$ that could possibly function as sub or super solutions with suitably chosen $a$. But, to my understanding, comparison principle only works when coefficients in the equation are well behaved, which is not the case here: at $r=0$ the coefficients are diverging. How can I rigorously apply the comparison principle in this case? A somewhat related question is, what do we know about $\partial_{r}u$? In particular, can we show that $\partial_{r}u$ is bounded when $a_1r\le u(r)\le a_2r$? Ultimately, I would like to use comparison principle to give a bound on $u$ and, in consequence, a bound on $\partial_{r}u$ with $u$ solving a quasilinear equation $$ \partial_{t}u=\partial_{rr}u+\frac{2}{r}\partial_{r}u-\frac{2}{r^{2}}f(u)\quad u(0,t)=0. $$ Here $f$ is smooth and $f(u)=u+\mathcal O(u^{2})$. 

As @suvrit suggests we have $$ \frac{\Gamma(\alpha,x)-\Gamma(\alpha,y)}{\Gamma(\beta,x)-\Gamma(\beta,y)}=\frac{\int_y^x t^{\alpha-1}e^{-t}dt}{\int_y^x t^{\beta-1}e^{-t}dt}=\frac{\int_y^x (t^{\alpha-\beta})t^{\beta-1}e^{-t}dt}{\int_y^x t^{\beta-1}e^{-t}dt}. $$ We can now maximize $t^{\alpha-\beta}$ depending on the sign of $\alpha-\beta$. For any $t\in[y,x]$ we have $$ t^{\alpha-\beta}\le\begin{cases}x^{\alpha-\beta}\quad &\text{ for } \alpha>\beta\\y^{\alpha-\beta}\quad &\text{ for } \alpha<\beta\\\end{cases} $$ which gives the requested estimate. 

Given a binary function $f: [1..n] \times [1..n] \to [1..n]$ how to check that this operation is a group operation on $[1..n]$? It's obvious that this can be done in $O(n^3)$ time just by checking all group properties. The most time-expensive property is associativity. Also it's clear that it could not be done faster than $O(n^2)$ time since you should at least examine all values $f(i,j)$. The question is if there is any algorithm to solve this problem in time faster than $O(n^3)$? 

Consider a finite group where all elements have the same order $n$. What could be said about such groups? For $n=2$ it could be proved that such group is isomorphic to $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^k$. Could it be somehow generalized on case $n>2$? EDIT: Surely the identity has order 1, so we have to exclude it. 

If we take $x_n = (-1)^n x$ then $x_n$ converges to $0$ in Cesaro sence. But no subsequence of $x_n$ converges weakly to $0$. $x_n$ is also a bounded sequence. Hence your statements seems wrong. 

If $n_1$ and $n_2$ are not too big you can use Eratosthenes sieve (see wikipedia for this). If they are big enought you can use sieve to cross out numbers which have small prime divisors and after that check every number that wasn't crossed out and check if it is prime using any primality test (see $URL$
