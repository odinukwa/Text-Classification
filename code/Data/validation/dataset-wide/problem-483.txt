The tire is defective (least likely). The tire is simply not settling onto the rim properly. You managed to twist/pinch the tube while installing. 

If I see a significant bump coming (on my touring bike -- no suspension), or just a stretch of fairly rough pavement, I'll generally raise my bum a few inches off the seat and flex my arms, so that my legs and arms are the "springs". This in not only more pleasant than taking the hard bumps, it also helps the bike maintain contact with the road, reducing the chance of the wheels sliding out from under you. And, of course, it's easier on the wheels. Plus, I suspect the physics of it all makes it better from an energy expenditure standpoint -- less of your forward momentum is lost to the bump. 

It is rare for a bike bearing to suddenly seize. Even a bearing "run dry" or exposed to saltwater or whatever will generally just get rough and squeaky. In order to seize you generally have one of two things: 

Basically, you can run any width of tire that can safely clear the brakes and frame and which is not "too wide" for the rim. When considering brake/frame clearance you need to understand that a "wider" tire will not only be wider but "taller", so make sure that the outer circumference of the tire will not rub against the frame or the brake pivot (in the case of caliper brakes). And if the new tires have a deeper tread than the old ones, account for that as well. What's "too wide" for a rim is hard to say -- there are no rigid rules. My rims are about 20mm, yet I run 45mm tires (and this is the way it came from the manufacturer). Your rims also look to be about 20mm, so rim width is likely not an issue for you -- you could easily run 35mm tires on them (if you have the frame clearance). When you install wider tires, be sure to carefully check the brake pads to assure they do not rub against the side of the tire at all, when brakes are being applied (since this will eventually wear a hole in the tire -- ask me how I know). It may be necessary to move the brake pads a little lower (or have a bike shop do it) to eliminate potential rubbing. I'd suggest seeing if a 28 or 32 will fit. 

The tube will last the life of the tire, and more, if not punctured too much. The tire will last until it wears too thin and starts puncturing a lot, unless damaged. Tires do, however, become brittle and crack in the sidewalls from UV and ozone exposure, and will need to be replaced every 10 years or so if not worn out first. White wall and gum wall tires crack faster. Tubes also will crack with age, around the valve stem. Running too low of a pressure can also destroy a tire. 1500km is nothing, if the tires are kept properly inflated. 

What precisely is wrong with it? If it's got high friction when you work the pump without it connected then working the right kind of lube into the cylinder would do the trick. (Not sure what the "right kind" would be, but definitely NOT regular oil. Probably either a glycerine product or a silicone product.) If it's leaking air back through the cylinder then lube might help, or you may need a new "leather" (which is no doubt plastic/rubber). If it's leaking through the "chuck" that fits on the stem then some lube there may help, or a new gasket. 

At a minimum, for cooler weather, I'd say you need to have at least the jacket part of a "sauna suit" -- a lightweight waterproof jacket. In some situations you will appreciate the pants as well. But, as the name implies, a "sauna suit" is incredibly uncomfortable when exert yourself in it, so it's nice to have something a bit less waterproof (but better breathing) for use in light rain or mist. But the "sauna suit" is nice to have because it's very light and packs into maybe a 6" diameter ball (or almost any other shape with the same volume). Otherwise, when you think you may get wet avoid cotton (especially cotton socks). And I very much like Coolmax socks, in part because Coolmax doesn't soak up much water and it maintains its loft and cushion even when wet. 

You could try painting the thing with a "rust converting primer" from an auto parts place. This creates a harder surface than regular paint, though it will need renewal from time to time, and it's a sort of ugly brown color. But just keeping a light coat of grease (or just chain oil) on the thing should work. (The rust is purely cosmetic -- it does not threaten the integrity of the hitch in any way.) 

If you haven't done so recently, get your bike tuned up. Wheels that are just a little wonky, shifters that don't respond reliably, even a handlebar or seat that's slightly askew -- all can "upset your game" and put you more on edge to begin with. Drop down a gear and pick up your cadence. At a higher cadence you tend to wobble less, and psychologically you're less likely to be spooked by the whoosh of a vehicle, since the rhythm sort of carries you through. 

And, of course, cell phone, money, and ID (placed somewhere where people can find it). I have my name, address, emergency contacts, etc on a gummed label stuck to the top bar of my bike and covered with clear tape 

Others may disagree with me on this, but I feel that, if the sprockets are usable at all, it never hurts to try simply installing a new chain. Yes, the chain will likely wear faster, but chains aren't that expensive, and usually you'll get at least marginally better behavior than with the old chain. And it's usually safe to replace a worn rear cluster without replacing the front chainrings. The rear cluster usually wears about twice as fast as the chainrings, so the front may still have some life in it. (And the chainrings can be replaced one at a time -- no point in replacing your small ring, eg, if you never use it and it's not worn.) But never replace cluster or chainrings without replacing the chain (unless it's relatively new and tests OK with a chain gauge). You can lengthen the life of your sprockets by replacing the chain at relatively frequent intervals. 

I've run into situations on cheap BSOs (rebuilding bikes for Christmas Anonymous) where the pivots were welded on and we had this problem. Using shims (washers) worked OK, though it looked a little dorky. 

The question of HOW the system works to prevent head-over accidents is quite simply answered: The front brake is actuated by force generated from the forward motion of the rear wheel. If the rear wheel stops moving then the front brake is released. When one brakes hard with the front wheel the momentum of the rider will tend to tip the bike forward, lifting the rear wheel. Even before the rear wheel lifts completely, it will lose traction and begin to skid. The rear wheel stops turning and the front brake is released (or at least moderated, in situations where traction is not completely lost). The effect would be very much like ABS braking on an automobile, and the classical panic stop head-over accident would be essentially impossible. (Of course, one could still hit something or fall into a hole and go head-over, but such a scenario has nothing to do with brakes.) Skid-outs are a hair more complicated, and likely the effect would only be significant in certain scenarios -- mainly those on dry pavement where the problem was over-braking on the front, vs scenarios where the pavement condition was a large factor. (But I get the impression that the real intent of the question, or at least of the responses, is to beat up on this idea rather than attempt to understand it.) 

I don't see much point in "improving" the bike until you decide what improvements you need. About the only thing I can think of that you might want to change right off is the tires, if they're heavily lugged (which I can't tell from the description) and you prefer road to off-road riding. And, of course, you may find that a different seat would suit you better -- that's a fairly personal thing. Otherwise, wait to see what bothers you and fix it as you make up your mind. The bike appears to be of at least decent quality, and replacing components (other than the tires or seat) is not likely to change how it rides in the near term. What you may want to do is add a rack, headlight, etc, based on your specific needs, but these are pretty much the same regardless of bike quality (and could be transferred to a new bike, should you ever decide to "trade up"). After a month or two (after the cables and brakes have "broken in" a bit) you should take the bike to a bike shop for a tune-up -- adjust the brakes and shifters. After that the tune-up should only be needed once/twice a year. 

First off, got to a bike shop and get a new crank bolt. They're a fairly standard item. Can't tell for sure if your bike had "self removing" bolts or standard ones, but it doesn't matter that much, a standard style should fit. The large threads in the crank arm are for holding a removable trim plug over the bolt (or holding the "self-removing" part of a self-removing bolt) and for facilitating a crank remover (which is kind of not needed at this juncture). You can ask for a new trim plug at your LBS, but it's not really needed. Once you have the bolt, you can try reattaching the existing crank arm. It will need to be really tight -- look up the torque specs on the web if you have a torque wrench, otherwise just get the bolt damn tight. But once a bike has been ridden with a loose crank arm the arm is usually damaged beyond repair -- likely it will keep working itself loose, and will eventually damage the crank axle (if it hasn't already). So you probably need to replace the arm, and you might as well replace the crank cartridge at the same time, since it's probably cheaper than the new arms. (So I'm guessing you've figured out by now that you should never ride a bike with a loose crank arm.) 

I wonder if they glued the caps in? Yeah, you'll have to dig out the caps. As you know, they're relatively soft plastic, so it doesn't require super high-tech tools. Probably something like an ice pick to pry a section of the plug body away from the threads, then try to cut through it with a small screwdriver. Or just pry away in several spots and see if that doesn't make it possible to unscrew it. As Mike said, you need the crank cap threads inside the bolt opening in order to install the crank puller, so try not to damage them very much, and when you install the puller work it in slowly, then back, then in again as you "chase" the (hopefully only) slightly munged threads. Worst case, if you really wanted to save the bike, you'd have to use an angle grinder with a cutoff wheel to cut away both cranks, or at least cut them back to where you could access the bolts. 

Likely the pawl has gotten gummed up, but can't help you with disassembly. (It's not unheard of for the LBS repair guy to just spray lube into the shifter in this case, to try to free it up.) But try this link: $URL$ 

Not ideal. You need something that will penetrate into the chain, and grease will not readily do that. If your chain really needs lubing and you can't get any proper chain oil then plain old engine oil would be a better choice. ("Sewing machine oil"/3-in-One oil would be a second choice, but it's probably a hair too "light".) The real bike maintenance nuts used to melt paraffin wax, beeswax, and kerosene together and soak their clean, dry chains in that. This is essentially the lube applied at the factory. But modern liquid chain lubes work as well with less trouble/mess. 

and draw a vertical line right down the center between the two wheels, you will see that only the part of the rider's body from the shoulders up is ahead of the line -- easily 2/3rds of the weight of the rider is rear of that center line. (And I don't know if the numbers work out to make it significant, but keep in mind that when the cyclist applies power to the crank that creates a force vector that shifts more downward force to the rear wheel.) When a cyclist gets in an aero tuck, however 

Cables will actually "work harden" slightly and become very slightly less elastic as they age. If they really do get "stretchy" it's because several strands have broken and the cable is near failure. Of course, many other things bend/stretch in the cable path, one being the brake calipers. As the bushings get worn and the brakes abused over time they sometimes begin operating at a sort of an angle that amplifies their inherent springiness. Worn/misaligned brake pads will contribute to this effect as well. 

For a lightweight light that clamps to a seatpost all you need is a piece of pipe of the appropriate diameter and some way to clamp it to your rack. I'd recommend about a 5" length of plastic or steel electrical conduit (though buying such a short length may be difficult). Or a length of wooden dowel will work. Clamping it to the rack will require some ingenuity, but if the rack has a reflector bracket attached you could drill holes in the pipe to bolt to the bracket. If there are only mounting holes for a reflector bracket, you can bolt an "corner bracket" to the rack and bolt the pipe to the bracket. But another option, for the light you have, is to discard the pipe-clamp portion of the bracket and bolt just the actual mount to something. A short length of aluminum "angle iron" would probably work. 

The first problem may be minor or may be major, depending on how you ride, how you rack/store your bike, etc. The second problem is somewhat more of a constant, but is variable depending on your riding style (more aggressive will generally be more stressful on the tape) and the quality of the tape and the wrapping job. So basically, you just replace it when it needs replacing, or when you can't stand the look of the stuff. (Of course, as I've said before, I just use a couple of layers of hockey tape. It is easily installed, durable, works better when wet/sweaty, and can be easily repaired if scraped/torn.) 

I think the max speed I've ever reached is about 60mph. However, since then I've had at least three experiences where I was riding downhill at a somewhat lower speed (30-40mph) and encountered a rough section of road and nearly lost control. A bike that seems perfectly stable on smooth pavement can get surprisingly unstable at moderately high speed on rougher pavement. So I have a self-imposed speed limit of about 30mph. Certainly more skilled riders on well-tuned bikes may go faster with reasonable safety, but I doubt that any rider is particularly safe above 40mph or so, except on a closed track or at least on a hill the rider is familiar with. 

I've never heard of a ready-made device to do what you want. The only thing I can think of is to get the fan or magnetic resistance device from a training stand or rollers and somehow attach it in a way that it can be switched on and off. Or even better would be to get a rig such as used in some exercise bikes where there is an aluminum flywheel with an electromagnet arranged next to it, such that resistance increases as the magnetic field increases. (In theory a deep aluminum rim could be used instead of the flywheel.) But you'd have to salvage parts from somewhere to do any of these, and then do some machine shop work. Otherwise probably the best solution in your case is a bike with disk brakes. 

In the "trunk mounted" category there are those designed for conventional trunks and those designed for hatchbacks. In all three categories there are racks that support the bike with both wheels on and "fork mount" racks that connect to the front fork to provide stability. Fork mount is especially handy for rooftop racks since it eliminates the need for some sort of vertical support which is unstable and hard to attach. But fork mount only works if you have a quick release on the front wheel and nothing such as a front rack that interferes with mounting. There are arguments for/against all styles. The rooftop units require some strength and a bit of "tallness" to use, but are otherwise the most flexible, and capable of carrying 4-5 bikes. They do produce the most wind drag (and lost MPG) on long trips, though. It may be hard to find a trunk-mount unit that suits your car. And a trunk mount unit is generally only well-suited to a single bike, maybe 2. Trailer hitch units are pretty good -- easy to get the bike on/off, able to handle 2-3 bikes and not too sensitive to bike style. But they are not particularly stable on rough roads, and they of course require a car with a (fairly heavy-duty) trailer hitch. (If you decide to get a trailer hitch installed to accept a bike rack, try to get a 2-inch "class 3" one, rather than the smaller class 2. This improves the stability of the rack.)
