So if you define the lax end $\oint_x T(x,x)$ to be the representative of $\mathrm{Lax}(\hom_K, L(1,T))$, then you get $\oint_x [F x, G x] \simeq \mathrm{Lax}(\hom_K, [F-, G-])$, which is not quite what you want, but it's close. Hope that helps. 

Edit: Jason Rute beat me to it by 52 seconds. From a quick look at that paper it seems negative arity refers to contravariance: e.g. if $A \vdash B$, then $\lnot B \vdash \lnot A$. It's all explained in Comment 1, below Definition 2.1. 

Each $f^* = Ef$ has a right adjoint $f_!$, and The Beck--Chevalley condition holds: E takes any pullback square in C to an isomorphism in Cat whose mate is again an isomorphism. 

This page says that you may be able to get a copy by emailing Andrée Ehresmann. I don't know the exact answer to your question, but if you can't find a reference then it may be worth recalling that: 

Monadicity theorems like Beck's give sufficient conditions on a functor $U \colon B \to A$ with a left adjoint F to be equivalent (in the slice category Cat/A) to the forgetful functor out of the category $A^{U F}$ of algebras for the monad $U F$. Aside from their obvious usefulness in universal algebra, one important application is in descent theory: suppose you have a category C and a C-indexed category E (i.e. a pseudofunctor $E \colon C^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathrm{Cat}$) such that 

What you're asking is whether every limit in a functor category $[B,C]$ is a pointwise limit. The answer is yes if C is complete, but not always otherwise. Kelly gives an example in Basic Concepts of Enriched Category Theory, section 3.3, of a limit in a functor category that is not a pointwise limit. I don't know of any striking examples of always-pointwise properties. One obvious example is that of being an absolute limit or colimit (i.e. one preserved by every functor). The latter are characterized by the fact that a category is Cauchy complete if and only if it has all absolute colimits. 

As Fernando points out, you can't talk about isomorphisms in a semicategory, which means that they won't be as much use as categories in describing universes of mathematical objects. But the category of semicategories has a surprisingly interesting relationship to that of categories. There is of course a forgetful functor $\mathrm{Cat} \to \mathrm{Semicat}$, and as Scott says it has a left adjoint that does what you expect. But it also has a right adjoint, which takes a semicategory S to the category of idempotents in S: the objects are idempotents $e \colon a \to a$ and a morphism $e \to e'$ is a morphism $f \colon a \to a'$ in S such that $fe = f = e'f$. So we get a monad on Cat whose unit is the canonical functor from a category to its idempotent-splitting completion, or Cauchy completion, or Karoubi envelope. Böhm, Lack and Street use this framework here to talk about weak Hopf algebras. They show that 'weak monoids' fall naturally out of the formal theory of monads if instead of working directly in a bicategory you Cauchy-complete the hom-categories first. Another application of semicategories and semifunctors is in computer science: Hayashi, Adjunction of semifunctors: categorical structures in nonextensional $\lambda$-calculus, TCS 41, shows how to describe $\lambda$-calculus without the $\eta$-law quite elegantly. I haven't worked it out, but it seems to me that this framework should also give a way of talking about 'weak limits' (the kind with not-necessarily-unique mediating morphisms) in terms of adjunctions. 

but until Gentzen came along it was common in logic (and still is in some quarters) to try to get away with as few connectives as possible, so that even implication would be defined away and not studied in its own right. In intuitionistic logic, however, and in non-classical logics generally, it's often not possible to define the usual connectives in terms of a subset of them. In particular, $p \to q$ intuitionistically implies $q \hookrightarrow p$ but not the other way round. I don't know if intuitionistic logicians have studied $\lnot q \to \lnot p$ as a connective in its own right. I do know, though, that I wouldn't call it co-implication -- I would reserve that name for the category-theoretic dual, say $\leftarrow$, of implication, where $p \mapsto p \leftarrow q$ would be the left adjoint to $r \mapsto q \vee r$. Andrzej Filinski studied this in Declarative continuations (LNCS, I forget which volume) and Tristan Crolard in Subtractive logic (Theoretical Computer Science, again I don't have the exact reference to hand). 

I assume that by 'cartesian' you mean 'having cartesian products'. In that case the answer is no. You've more or less said this yourself: for $C^{\mathbf{3}} \to C^{\mathbf{2}}$ or the composite $C^{\mathbf{3}} \to C$ to be fibrations it is again necessary and sufficient that C have pullbacks. The sequence makes perfect sense as a functor, of course, and the fibres are the same no matter what C looks like: an object over c is a composable pair of morphisms $\bullet \to \bullet \to c$ and a morphism is a 'square on top of a triangle'. 

There are probably many more (and this answer is CW so passers-by are invited to add them). Personally, I think that the structural and material viewpoints on mathematics complement each other very well, so I'd be delighted if someone could point out (or write!) a structural account of -- a sort of 'Mac Lane and Birkhoff' for -- even elementary analysis. 

Yes, it does, by Yoneda's lemma. The bijection $\phi$ is natural, hence its value $\eta_x$ at the identity determines its value at any $f'$ by exactly the formula given. (A question like this would be better asked on math.SE, I think.) 

Has a complete proof of this result (assuming it's true as stated) been published? Has its bicategorical analogue been treated? 

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but I'll ask it anyway, in the hope that some kindly Australian (true or honorary) is passing by and takes pity on me... In Fibrations in bicategories, Street shows that V-profunctors are exactly the codiscrete cofibrations in the 2-category V-Cat (i.e. the discrete 2-sided fibrations in the opposite of V-Cat). Rosebrugh and Wood later generalized this to well-behaved proarrow equipments. When V=Set, so that V-Cat is Cat, then, codiscrete cofibrations turn out to be essentially the same thing as discrete fibrations. My question is 

Firstly, the $W$-weighted limit $\lim^W F$ is defined to be a representation of $\operatorname{Psh}_D(W,C(-,F-))$; the definition you've given isn't even well-typed. There is no difference at all in $\mathrm{Set}$-enriched category theory between a representation and a universal arrow -- each determines the other, and when these exist for all suitable objects then adjoints are there whether you like it or not (this is all in Mac Lane). So I'm not sure what's particularly slick about this approach. Anyway, the non-pointwise right Kan extension is given, for $E \overset{K}{\leftarrow} C \overset{F}{\to} D $ by $$[C,D] (G K, F) \cong [E,D] (G, \operatorname{Ran}_K F)$$ which is exactly the same as the usual definition in terms of universal arrows. The pointwise extension is $(\operatorname{Ran}_K F)e = \lim^{E(e,K-)} F$. The difference is discussed in Kelly chapter 4.3. Incidentally, Kelly sticks to pointwise extensions because the non-pointwise ones aren't much use, not because he doesn't like the usual definition. Is that the kind of thing you're looking for? 

I've never heard this called 'Lawvere's segment' before, but your $L$ is the subobject classifier in the presheaf topos $[A^{\mathrm{op}},\mathrm{Set}]$. In presheaf toposes generally, the subobject classifier $\Omega$ is the presheaf that sends an object $a$ to the set of all sieves on $a$, i.e. the set of subobjects of $\hom(-,a)$. This means in this case that simplicial subsets $S' \subset S$ are in bijection with simplicial maps $S \to L$. Off the top of my head, I can't be exactly sure what $L$ looks like, but I'd guess it's the constant simplicial set with $L_n = 2$ (the set of truth values) and all maps identities. Then the characteristic map $\chi_{S'} \colon S \to L$ will be the usual $s \mapsto 1$ if $s \in S'$ and $0$ otherwise, while the simplicial subset corresponding to some $\phi \colon S \to L$ will be given by the fibres $\phi_n^{-1}(1)$ in each degree. $S'$'s being a simplicial subset should correspond to $\phi$'s being a simplicial map. I could easily be wrong about that last paragraph, though. There might be more about this in Mac Lane--Moerdijk. Edit: I was wrong -- see the comments below. 

I don't think I have seen anything like this published before, but I have written up a similar definition here (see here too). One thing in your definition I would take issue with is that your 2-coend's universal property needs more to deserve the '2-' in its name: what I would expect (and what my definition, which otherwise seems to be equivalent to yours, says) is a bicategorical universal property that says 

Adapted from the papers by Fiore and by Porter that I referred to above: To form the usual lax colimit of P we take the disjoint union of the $P_i$ for each $i \in C$ and then adjoin new arrows to represent the action of P: for each $m \colon i \to j$ in C and each $X \in P_i$ there is an arrow $X \to Pm(X)$. Then we quotient by a congruence that ensures that the assignment of $X \to Pm(X)$ to $X$ is lax natural. This lax transformation is the universal cone. To form the pseudo colimit we simply make sure each $X \to Pm(X)$ is an isomorphism: adjoin a formal inverse along with it and add the requisite equations to the congruence. 

I haven't seen this written down anywhere, but I've worked it out myself in a paper I'm working on. The paper isn't quite ready, so I'll just sketch the idea here. As Zhen says, you need to generalise the weighted-colimit definition and put $$(\mathrm{Lan}_F G) b = \mathcal{B}(F-,b) \star G$$ Then you can express its universal property in two ways: $$ \mathrm{Ps}(\mathrm{Lan}_F G, E) \simeq \mathrm{Ps}\big(\mathcal{B}(F-, -), \mathcal{C}(G-, E-)\big) \simeq \mathrm{Ps}(G, EF)\,. $$ The first equivalence is the definition of a weighted colimit, and the second follows from some profunctor-y manipulations and the bicategorical Yoneda lemma. But now the composite of the two expresses precisely what you want a bicategorical left Kan extension to be. 

Sketch of an answer: Remember that $E/e$ is equivalent to $\operatorname{Span} E(e,1) $, and that the (lax-idempotent) 2-monad whose algebras are fibrations is given by composition with the span $\Phi e \colon e^{\mathbf{2}} \rightrightarrows e $ where the domain is the cotensor of e with the arrow category $\mathbf{2} = \bullet \to \bullet$. This functor $\Phi e \otimes -$ should have a right adjoint given by the right Kan extension (in $\operatorname{Span} E$) $\mathsf{ran}_{\Phi e} p$ of p along $\Phi e$. Now what you want is an Eilenberg--Moore-type theorem to tell you that a right adjoint to a 2-monad is a 2-comonad, and that their categories of (co)algebras are equivalent, which will give you your right adjoint to the forgetful functor. Edit: Actually, this is all only true for E/e the usual slice 2-category, with (essentially) commuting triangles as morphisms, not the 'lax' version you mention, where the triangles contain a non-invertible 2-cell. 

Your indices are hard to read, and I think you might have mixed some of them up. If you mean what I think you mean, then Mac Lane's result is exactly what you need. The two colimits are canonically isomorphic to each other and to the colimit over the product category $\mathcal{I} \times \mathcal{K}$. If you assume only that the system is functorial in $i \in \mathcal{I}$ and $k \in \mathcal{K}$ separately, then what you have is not necessarily a functor $\mathcal{I} \times \mathcal{K} \to \mathcal{C}$ (it's what John Power and Edmund Robinson call a binoidal functor), and I don't know if there is any sensible notion of limit for such a thing. 

Dylan's comment is right. More generally, if $D \colon J \to C$ is a diagram and $L \colon J' \to J$ a functor, then the colimit of D is isomorphic to the colimit of DL if and only if L is (co)final. See Mac Lane, Cats Work, section IX.3. 

Then (this is due to Bénabou and Roubaud) for a morphism f in C, the category of descent data for f is equivalent to the category of algebras for the monad $f_!f^*$. In particular, f is of effective descent if $f_!$ is monadic. See the nLab page on monadic descent for details. I believe the original application had C the category of commutative rings and $E \colon R \mapsto R\mathrm{-Mod}$. 

The answer is no, and it is explained in Appendix C of Leinster's book Higher Operads, Higher Categories. Briefly, a 'plain operad', for Leinster, is a non-symmetric operad in Set; a T-operad for T the free-monoid monad. Leinster shows that if T is a cartesian monad then a T-operad is the same thing as a cartesian monad S equipped with a cartesian transformation $S \to T$. So a plain operad is the same thing as a cartesian monad on Set that is 'augmented over' the free-monoid monad. But not every cartesian monad on Set is so augmented. 

I ask because (aside from curiosity) I'd like to know whether I can expect a 'biprofunctor' $L^{\mathrm{op}} \times K \to \mathrm{Cat}$ to be the same as a discrete fibration in Bicat, or even whether this is true in the strictly Cat-enriched case. In my specific case L and K are locally discrete, if that makes a difference. 

I don't see bicategories coming into this in a useful way, but I think what you have is a consequence of two more general facts: 

Here is one way to look at it: if V is a monoidal category and $\mathbf{B} V$ is the corresponding one-object bicategory, then a V-category in the usual sense is the same thing as a lax functor $\mathrm{c}(C_0) \to \mathbf{B} V$, where $C_0$ is a set and $\mathrm{c}(\cdot)$ is the fully faithful functor that takes a set to the codiscrete category on it (i.e. the one with $C_0$ as object set and exactly one morphism between each pair of objects). If C and D are V-categories then a V-functor from C to D is given by a function $f \colon C_0 \to D_0$ together with an identity-component oplax natural transformation (an icon) $\hat C \to \hat D \circ \mathrm{c}(f)$, where $\hat C, \hat D$ are the lax functors corresponding to C and D. What you have seems to be a general oplax transformation, without the condition that its components be identities. For that reason it's probably a not-unreasonable definition to write down, although I for one have never seen an example in the wild. At the end of your question you are getting somewhere close to the notion of a category enriched in a bicategory, see here. 

I'm not sure what you mean by 'fail' here. It is true, as you say, that classical proofs can exhibit behaviour that constructive proofs can't. In general, it's no longer true that a term of type A reduces to a constructive proof of the proposition A -- but that's only to be expected. Proof-terms in classical logic are strongly normalizing, though (if you're sensible about it), so there are no 'endless loops'. The difference is that, in general, such proof-terms can have more than one distinct normal form, and there is no good reason to pick one over any other. You say
