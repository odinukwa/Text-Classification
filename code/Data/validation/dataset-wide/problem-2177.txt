There is a gap you need to overcome before you ask. You compared your code to what he gave you and didn't detect the deltas. To your boss there must be clear differences. Study the coding style of other code in the repo and patterns may emerge. You will also become more familiar with the code base at the same time. 

I'll give you the Shark Tank answer. If you believe in the startup and you are a founder/owner, commit. Most startups do fail, but one of the reasons is lack of commitment. What happens if you go from one day a week at the startup to seven? Can you get the product/service to market or to an investable stage quickly? What is the reward? Will the startup bring you millions or wages? If you can bring a $million product to market in three-six months of 7-day weeks, you should quit and crash on friends couches (or call mom & dad about your old room). If you still think part-time is better, it's hard to say. You said there is no legal conflict, so you need to think about perceptions. If you say it's personal and they find out it's business, that could be a problem of perception - they could feel lied to. If you are just "average" as you say, they should be fairly neutral towards you - less likely to feel "hurt" than if their best employee wanted to leave. If they like you personally, they may be more willing to help you start your own business. In that case being direct is best, even better if the company is small and young - they may admire the entrepreneur in you. 

You will almost never get such feedback in the US. Mostly because people are concerned about lawsuits, they'll never say "it appeared to us that you were weak in area_Q" because that invites an argument/discussion that no, you are fully qualified in area_Q. Likewise, if you rubbed them the wrong way, you won't get an accurate assessment of the issue. 

Generally, the process you describe is called "deprovisioning." It can be a headache for most HR departments because it is manual and frequently error-prone. One does not only need to disable accounts, but also notify insurance companies of the termination, or discontinue cell phone service. 

In most Windows environments, the account is locked in Active Directory. You never delete the accounts because they may come back, or you may need to set up the next guy with the same roles/permissions as the one who quit. Someone should have a list of what each person has been issued (such as SecureID tokens), and check them off upon departure. 

Your role in the project is important. If you are a technical resource, it is not your job to "rescue the project". If you are the project manager, it is different. If they want you to do both...run? It sounds like you are on the technical side, since you talk about the technology stack. If so, I would look at this as almost a win-only case. If your skills are sound, and you are motivated, you should be able to do something with the technologies. To your advantage, the bar seems pretty low - failing slower is an improvement! As long as you have been clear about you strengths with the technology, you have set the expectation that there is some learning involved. At a minimum you should expect some time to improve your skills on your own, but you could also negotiate some training. Tell them you would like them to bring in an expert for one day to give you some 1-on-1. Accepting the position shows you are a team player. Discussing your concerns in the process and proposing risk mitigation shows you are a smart team player. If the project succeeds, you are part of a turn-around team and people will remember. If you are successful and "save" the project, the rewards are even greater. If the project continues to fail, and you are not adding to the problems, it will have a minimal negative effect on you. 

No. Determining if the fit is going to work both ways is part of the interviewing process. I would have phrased it more along the lines of "well, this isn't going to work out for either of us, so let's stop wasting each others' time and call it a day." Time is the most valuable thing we each have. No one has more hours in a day than the next person - we all get the same 24 hours per day. Wasting another person's time isn't a polite thing to do. It is a denial of service attack on their life. Some people are more about being in charge, and it is quite possible that they were enraged that some puny subject would reject King Manager. Upsetting someone's dominance ritual usually leads to fights on the school playground, or in the ghetto. You'll also see them played out as "you can't quit, you're fired" with "you can't fire me, I quit" being shouted around. 

Try packaging your work and making it easier to review. Estimate the time it will take to review the items. If you have a lot of small independent items, package them into sets of code into logical chunks that can be reviewed within a specific period - like one hour. Schedule a meeting and send links to the repo items. Talk to the team and explain you are trying to clear the backlog through a series of short and targeted meetings. From the other side, you can put everything together into a growing, single review request. But this is sort of pushing in the direction you don't seem to want to go. Every time you complete a new unit of code, add it to this single request, and update the total time. It may be that people just aren't thinking about the backlog growth. If you manager sees a code review request and it says, "This is a code review request for item X committed on {x/x/x} | {21 days ago}, item y committed on {x/x/x} | {20 days ago}, item... It will take approximately 40 hours to review these 200 items", it will drive home the point. 

You cannot control what other people will say; you can only control what you do in response. Viktor Frankl put it: 

Reason for sentence 1: it is a resignation letter, there needs to be no possible misunderstanding about what is going on. It needs to be in writing as I've worked for bosses who deny that the person quitting was quitting so as to screw with them starting elsewhere. Reason for sentence 2: I've worked for places that have "backdated" resignation letters and claimed you quit today - not in 2 weeks. Consequently, you may be expecting a paycheck that you'll never recieve. This is also why you date it with $today when you sign it. Reason for sentence 3: Many people move, and if you need paperwork sent to you (such as retirement, health benefits, or your P45), there have been places I've worked at where they would deliberately and maliciously send your paperwork to an old address so that you cannot reply in the mandated 30 day period (because either it was still tied up in the post office's change of address system, or if that expired, returned to sender). Never ever add stuff about why you are leaving. It is none of their business. If they ask, answer verbally, but never in any sort of writing. 

As others have said, apply to both. While as @IDrinkandKnowThings says you run a risk, on the other side you can emphasize in your cover you are applying not so much to the job, but to the company because you have such a strong desire to work there. Also consider other channels beyond the online application system. Do your research and see if this company works with recruiters. You can search old job postings by company name and see if they were posted by recruiters. The recruiting company will usually have an account manager for the company that understands the company needs and people. If you can impress this person, they can point you in the right direction or get your resume near the top of the stack for review. 

When folks start discussing politics, you can always demurr and say you are busy, or that you don't want to talk about it. Debates do not exist to change people's minds, they are performed to score points amongst the faithful of your own side. This is why both sides are claiming "my guy won!" 

The governing statute in the US is the ESIGN ACT (text of statute). Generally, courts have treated the situation as "if both parties treat it as a signature, then so will we" (section 1-303 of the UCC calls this "course of performance, course of dealing and usage of trade"). I used to work for a company where we dealt with the signatures and attestations; ESIGN is a bit complicated as the supporting regulations also require things like the electronic documents be readable and provable for at least 10 years. PDF/A is an attempt to make PDF documents suitable for long-term archival.
