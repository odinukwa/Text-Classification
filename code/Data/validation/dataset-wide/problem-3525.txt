All that said, let's put those complications aside. Say the government tries to provide more public sector jobs (of some low perceived quality perhaps). The quantity is fixed to always provide jobs for every applicant at exactly the price where the worker would be indifferent between working and taking the public job. Thus, everyone searching can find employment, and in fact, everyone will be induced to join the labor market in this scenario. Note that the government has changed the number of people in the labor market. You can form an economy with one representative private good, and one collective (public) good. The government levies taxes on consumers to freely to fund their jobs program if needed. The private sector produces the private good, while the government can produce the private or collective good. The government has the same technology as the private sector. Thus, we have the different components of our economy: $$ \begin{align} \text{Utility:} & \qquad U(x_p, x_c, e) \\ \text{Prices:} & \qquad p(\sum x_p), p(\sum x_c) \\ \text{Production:} & \qquad f_p(\sum e), f_c(\sum e) \\ \text{Private Sector Profit:} & \qquad \pi(x_p) = f_p \cdot p_{x_p} - c(w, e)\\ \text{Government Profit:} & \qquad \pi(x_p, x_c, t) = f_p \cdot p_{x_p} + f_c \cdot p_{x_c} - c(w, e) + t\\ \end{align} $$ You can add in the appropriate subscripts for the collective good to indicate what you desire about how the benefits or costs of the collective good are captured. We have $e$ as effort, $c(w, e)$ cost given wages and effort, $t$ as the tax, in this a case a simple lump sum. Solving for the equilibrium in the case with or without any government intervention here and then applying Shephard's Lemma would get you the consumer's expenditure function, which you can use to compare the cost of living in each case. If utility for each agent increases with the government provision or stays the same, then although the cost of living may increase, we would say in this scenario it is a Pareto improvement to have the government provision. Obvious extensions to the model could be changing the type of tax, making it so that you can levy a tax on production rather than consumption, or changing the competition so that you can use game theory to analyze price setting. If this all seems rather theoretical (we have not specified the functional form of these equations), it's because your question is very broad. There is no way to succinctly analyze the effects of full employment on the cost of living. I gave my opinion above that I think it sounds infeasible, but if you wanted to set up a model and investigate for yourself, that might be a noble effort. My official answer thus is that it's unclear what effect a government provision of jobs would be on the cost of living. (Boring safe answer, I know.) 

Starting Backwards Induction (skip this if you just wanna get to the question) One thing to note is that if the fighters set $F < \frac{1}{2}$, then there becomes a perverse incentive to throw the fight, which we imagine would cause less expected effort during the fight despite the dis-utility of losing. Knowing this, the consumers would purchase fewer tickets, which would decrease the fight purse, but also decrease the dis-utility of losing. So the change in $F$'s effect on effort is ambiguous in this question's current form. Suppose $F > \frac{1}{2}$. Say that the fight is already on and the wages for the winner and loser and the number of animals at the venue are fixed. The only change in utility happens with effort expended. For $N = 1$, even here it is difficult to think of a pure Nash equilibrium. If the tortoise exhausts effort and the hare matches (thus winning), the tortoise will want to deviate by lowering effort. If the tortoise exerts no effort, the hare would want to match, but that would cause the tortoise to want to exert effort, which would give the hare the opportunity to increase effort. And so on. The only way a pure Nash equilibrium exists is if at effort level $0$, the tortoise would find the marginal cost of exerting more effort and getting the winning payoff to be greater than the marginal benefit of getting that winning payoff. $e_t = 0, e_h = 0$ would then be Nash (then there is no incentive to lower effort, because the tortoise can't). On the flip side, maybe the hare would be in this position while the tortoise wasn't, so $e_t = 0 + \epsilon, e_h = 0$ would be some (ill-defined) Nash. What about randomized strategies? Consider a discrete case: \begin{array} {|r|r|r|r|} & e_h = 0 \;& e_h = 1 \;& e_h = 2 \;\\ \hline e_t = 0 & \underline{u}(e = 0), \overline{u}(e = 0)& \underline{u}(e = 0), \overline{u}(e = 1) & \underline{u}(e = 0), \overline{u}(e = 2)\\ \hline e_t = 1 & \overline{u}(e = 1), \underline{u}(e = 0) & \underline{u}(e = 1), \overline{u}(e = 1) & \underline{u}(e = 1), \overline{u}(e = 2)\\ \hline \end{array} $e_h = 2$ is strictly dominated by $e_h = 1$, so we just look at cases where $e_h = 0, 1$ and similarly so where $e_t = 0, 1$ for the tortoise. $u_t(\sigma_h, e_t = 0) \geq u_t(\sigma_h, e_t = 1)$ if $p\underline{u}(e = 0) + (1-p)\underline{u}(e = 0) \geq p\overline{u}(e = 1) + (1-p)\underline{u}(e = 1)$ $\implies \frac{\underline{u}(e = 0) - \underline{u}(e = 1)}{\overline{u}(e = 1) - \underline{u}(e = 1)} \geq p$ where $p$ is the probability the hare picks $e_h = 0$. Similarly, with $q$ the probability the tortoise picks effort $e_t = 0$, our condition here is $q \geq \frac{\overline{u}(e = 1) - \underline{u}(e = 0)}{\overline{u}(e = 0) - \underline{u}(e = 0)}$ with these conditions, as long as $p, q \in [0, 1]$, we can get conditions for randomized Nash. For the continuous game, things are quite a bit trickier. Depending on what the fixed values are for the first and second arguments in fighter utility are as well, the existence of a randomized strategy might change. From here, we'd have to move back and see what each previous decision leading up to the fight would change. Then we could look at a two period fight, where the chance of getting knocked down would then come into play. 

I'm currently a TA for a class and recently graded a midterm. I gave the answer key back to the teacher, after going over part of the exam in a study hall. I was going to go over the rest of it tomorrow, but while making my own answer key in office hours, I seem to have come to a different answer than the teacher. 

FDIC insurance from the central bank, but more to the point, The bank isn't going to back up all the credit at the same time. Say in our above scenario (100 dollars, 10% req.) the bank lends out "air money" of 5 dollars to someone, who then spends the credit purchasing from a business. The business then claims on that credit, and the bank still had some reserve (10 dollars in cash) to pay the business. Meanwhile, the bank, because it lent out so much credit, is also collecting a lotttt of interest, and borrowers pay back that interest...in cash. That replenishes the reserve. So in an equilibrium money market, hopefully the rate at which the bank gets cash in interest is the same as the rate which they pay back the "air money" with that actual cash. 

The answer depends on whether the provision of full employment is a public good that corrects for a negative externality (poverty). Suppose it is and we wish to create full employment. First, we should consider what makes government provision of jobs different from policies like unemployment insurance? Instead of hedging against business cycles causing cyclical unemployment, we are now trying to effectively eliminate it. Then, we should consider if the government providing jobs as an employer of last resort would be any different than normal public sector jobs. Presumably, providing such undesirable jobs shouldn't crowd out the private labor market, but at the same time, what is to say that people wouldn't just reject these and continue to seek out jobs in the private sector? The main route I see for making the government an employer of last resort would be to replace black markets, or to provide competition in inefficient markets. The former option has a prohibitively expensive political cost (and if allowed would be blockaded to the point of gross inefficiency). The latter option is harder to parse through. Most monopolies or inefficient markets we think of today are in technology or other places where monopolies benefit from large economies of scale. Treating the provision of goods in those markets as utilities and then subsidizing them is the go-to option. The other thing that could happen is that the government abuses its power to become a monopoly itself in the market it tries to provide employment for. 

One (perhaps flippant) answer is that Marxists have a lot of ideas about how prices "should" work or how the value of labor "should" be rewarded, that aren't in line with what we observe, because central planning and/or mass subsidies that Marxist economies like end up being grossly inefficient. :P Another (perhaps more interesting) answer is that there is quantitative Marxist models. Kinda. The main body of work that comes to mind for me is from Micha≈Ç Kalecki and his version of the profit equation. He was a Marxist economist around the time of Keynes (and his work has Keynesian influences or influenced Keynes, depending on who you ask). 

which has some interesting implications. From my very basic knowledge of Kalecki, he tends to sort agents in the model as capitalists (firm owners), workers (sell labor to capitalists), and other proprietors (trade work, artisans, services). His models have a narrative around profit-led vs wage-led growth and what it means for investment and tax policy. The article cited probably has more knowledge about this guy than me. Kalecki's Profit Equation after 80 Years (1) 

Under each of these models, technology doesn't "just happen", but is reflected through lowering the marginal costs of the firm, which is essential for the firm to be competitive against its rivals. The less technologically advanced the firm is, the more of the market they will lose out on. Economic profit here can be used to invest into research and development or just straight up "technology" to reduce the cost of capital usage over time or other such things like that. Even in perfect competition with no economic profit, the reason there is no economic profit will partly be because firms have to constantly update their technology to remain competitive, regardless of how differentiated the products are (as long as $d > 0$). 

I was reading an article on Becker Social Pricing, where your demand for a good depends on other people's demand for the good. So basically this paper is meant to be a primer into explaining why some places price in such a way that they have chronic shortages (think of big concerts or popular restaurants). I think the idea is that seeing many people want to attend this event actually is part of what contributes to this high demand for the good, and the demand is not convex. Since demand is not convex, as in Walrasian smooth demand, (if of course I am interpreting this model correctly), then how do utility maximization problems work here, say, if we had two goods that followed this model? Assuming we still have Kuhn-Tucker sufficiency, would we just set up a Lagrangian as normal, or are there some stronger conditions we need to make sure a maximum exists? 

An externality is a cost on a third party resulting from an economic transaction, that isn't captured by the buyer(s) and/or seller(s) of the initial transaction. So if the price of oranges goes up, as in BKay's comment, it may or may not be an externality on orange buyers. If I decided to buy the right to burn a bunch of oranges from the government (I'm a real rebel), and that caused a supply shortage, then that does end up being an externality on orange buyers, since they had no input on my transaction, but they are bearing the cost. In this simple housing example in BKay's example, if I simply have the right to build (I "buy" the right to do so from a non-existent "seller" and/or government), then imposing on your view is a negative externality for you, since you bear the cost of the lost view, and not me or the "seller". Whether or not you expected me to build there does not particularly matter. In short, think of my building as a sort of pollution, the archetypal negative externality. This requires market correction. 

Since the question is asking for clarification on a given answer, I don't think this question necessarily needs to be closed. To address your concerns: You will recall Walras' Law states $p \cdot x = w$. That is, you spend all your money buying things, given some regularity conditions. So just figure out how much was spent in year 1 and that will give you wealth for that period. For year 2, you'll note that depending on the range for $x^2_2$, it will imply the consumer having different amounts of wealth. That will give you the information you need to find where good 1 is inferior. It might be helpful to think about what ranges of good 2 would violate WARP, and what the ranges above and below it would mean. Hope this helps.
