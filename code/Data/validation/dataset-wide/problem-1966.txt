Accept that no matter what you do, sometimes things will just go astray. No matter how attractive your offer is, your potential new employee may get hit by a bus or win $50,000,000 on the lottery. Make sure your offer is very very good. This isn't always just a case of writing a big number in the salary column. People like to feel wanted. People like to feel like they're making a difference. People like to feel like they're respected. Listen to them The applicant's seemingly off-hand remark about working from home, or that they're not sure they like some aspect of the role or your standard contract that you think is minor might be more important to them than you think. 

Almost certainly yes they can. If making you wear these uniforms isn't somehow tantamount to discrimination against a protected class in your country (e.g. you're all female and they're making you all wear absurdly short miniskirts) then why wouldn't they be allowed to make some particular teams wear uniforms? If it's only your team wearing them now due to funding concerns then it may be that other teams will see them introduced over time. Someone has to be first. My employer expects canteen/kitchen staff to wear appropriate uniform for serving and preparing food, for example. Nothing unusual about that. 

A performance review could mean anything from "you're about to be fired" or "you're about to be promoted, or at least offered a payrise" to "your CEO has finally reached the letter P in their 'A to Z of how to be a CEO' book". Without further context its impossible to say; performance reviews should be a normal part of feedback from your employer. Unless there are particular reasons to think otherwise related to employment law in your country or something else equally intractable, I would suggest that an employer sociopathic enough to use performance reviews out of the blue just to fire people is sociopathic enough to just fire those people and save its managers the effort of doing a performance review first. Are you the only person getting a performance review (note that simply being first isn't quite the same thing)? What makes you hear "performance review" and equate that to being fired in the first place? Is there some context for that you've not shared with us all? 

You need to firstly make sure that you are and the employee concerned are in absolutely clear agreement as to what constitutes work and what does not. If your employee could possibly have been signing out of the building then continuing to work from home for the remainder of the time then you need to stop monitoring the time they leave the building as this isn't relevant. If, however, they're absolutely not working during the times they've said they are and you've already spoken to them about this, as you say then you do have a serious issue. By ignoring your earlier talk they are essentially putting you in a position where you either become complicit in their actions if you continue to not formally discipline them (if you continue to not take action while you know this goes on it makes it more difficult for you to take action later), or you have to speak to them again more strongly, and continue down this road even if it leads to a formal process which you've said you don't want to do. Of the two choices, I would certainly prefer the latter one in your position. Failing to address this issue is not good for the team overall. As for consequences for you as a team leader your own managers should support you in this matter. You will do yourself (and possibly the employee too) far more serious damage, in fact, if you continue not to deal with this properly and HR or a more senior manager does eventually find out that this employee faked timesheets and you you knowingly signed off on fraudlent timesheets. 

Yes, this is incredibly annoying when you are the hiring manager. Most employers have a process they follow for hiring, and for things like internships this might well include having a deadline to submit applications by and not doing anything with applications until the deadline is reached, so that all the applicants can be fairly evaluated side-by-side (e.g. if we get 100 applications but only plan to interview 10 people, we want to try and ensure we're interviewing the 10 best applicants). Some employers will evaluate applications as they're received and contact people they find interesting as soon as possible. This is also valid (though less so for prestigious internships perhaps) but again the dynamic is that you follow their application process and they contact you if they wish. Submitting your application multiple times shows that you're unaware of the normal hiring process and does not reflect you in a favorable light. 

Whether or not it's possible at your current employer specifically is a question for your employer, not random people on the Internet, but the answer in general is "Yes, there can be". Some employers have an "engineer career track" that allows for growth and development as a technical authority within a specialist area without becoming a manager. 

In any formal writing, with the possible exception of a formal paper on emoticons or txtspk, emoticons are going to come over as immature and lazy. Even in the minority of cases where it won't harm you, it's unlikely to benefit you either. For the majority of employers, you might as well write "LOL! I won't take this job seriously if you give it to me LOL!!!!111!!11!one!!one!!!1", enclose a photo of your genetalia with the letter and be done with it because you will stand as much chance of being hired either way. Sorry if the paragraph above seems overly harsh or rude, that isn't my intention, but I do think its important to outline how much of a faux pas I think this would be. 

Unless you work in a country that requires a "release letter" or something similar to that then I can only say that what happens next is essentially up to you. Your boss can't refuse your notice; that's the whole point of notice. That's why it's called giving notice and not making a request. You're telling them that you will be leaving, not asking if you can. As for them refusing to give you a good reference, you can tell future employers that your boss "refused" to accept your notice and took this action. You will presumably have other references and providing that the bad reference/no reference from this boss is an exception rather than a rule then I would imagine most new employers will be prepared to accept that. 

Have you considered things from the point of view of your current boss? You may have improved in some areas they've asked you to address but not all, or not improved to the required degree. If you are asking them to recommend you for bigger roles then you're asking them to bet some of their reputation within the company on how well you've progressed. Maybe they're overly-cautious but they might still be correct. As this is a typical meeting for your organisation and not one you've asked for because of your issue I would suggest that you ask your immediate boss for some guidelines on what might typically come up at these meetings and stick to those unless the person you're speaking to leads the conversation elsewhere. Understand how the organisation uses these types of meetings, and use the chance to talk about the positive areas of your career rather that complain about the negatives. I certainly wouldn't go over the head of your immediate boss unless you had reason to believe they were actively discriminating against you, and even then I would advocate being careful without good evidence. 

Most companies big enough to use the phrase 'disciplinary infraction' are probably also big enough to have a formal process for appeals against this. The professional thing to do would be to assemble your evidence of your innocence and use this appeal process. 

To a large degree, welcome to the world of work I'm afraid. Things aren't "fair" and if you keep on complaining on that basis you will perhaps trade the mantle of "sloppy and slow" (is this what your senior colleague has said, or a label you are applying to yourself because you're taking their oversight personally?) for "complains all the time" which is worse. Instead of worrying about blame you need to take charge of fixing the root cause of the problem. It sounds like you and your fellow junior are overwhelmed and not managing time well yet. Do you have bug tracking systems? Can you implement one (even if its just a spreadsheet)? Can you take responsibility for noting all the bugs and then assign the ones that are down to your co-worker back to them to fix? Using a tracking system, and sharing it with the senior dev when they mention faults should start to push back against the negative impression others may have of you. Also speak to the senior dev and (without getting into 'blame games' talk about what their expectations are of you as the person who is there all the time vs. the one who is not, and also what their expectations are for producing new code vs. fixing bugs with old code. 

I'm not HR but I am involved in selecting candidates based on resumes. I appreciate that the whole vehicle for a graphic design resume is different from that in my field and I need to make allowances for that while looking at the sample here. I'm going to proceed by assuming you're asking about this idea as a general thing, as I suspect that this kind of design for a graphic designer is part of their portfolio of work in a minor way more than it is a traditional resume. I find the idea of "skill bars" presumptuous and rather useless. How can I possibly compare those "grades" to the skills of someone else? What if they have the same idea and give themselves 27 out of 30 for the same skills? How can I tell whether or not hiring that person will solve the problem I'm trying to solve by hiring someone? Don't tell a hiring manager how good you think you are, that's for them to decide. Show them how good you actually are. That is, of course, precisely what's happening in that sample, but not because of the number of dots in the skill bars. 

Fix whatever underlying problem has resulted in someone who was formerly your best team member to become disengaged to the point where they're largely useless to you. If it's a personal matter then perhaps there's not much you can do, but if it's an issue with the workplace that has cost you a good person then this should certainly be fixed. Outline what is and what is not acceptable to your team. Then ensure that everyone keeps to this standard and that you don't ignore the issue if you see someone start to fall off the wagon again. 

If they're paying you 10 days pay at your dismissal then I'd suggest you've been paid in lieu of notice. That's quite a common clause under UK law, which (I'm assuming) will be similar in Gibraltar, and allows a company to pay you for the time you would have worked during the notice period without having you at work. This may or may not be spelt out in your contract, you should check. This effectively is your compensation - with that payment they've made good on any material loss you'd have otherwise suffered (your wages for the period of time concerned) from them not allowing you to work out your notice period. Other than that, we can't really offer legal advice here and we haven't seen your contract, so whether or not you might have a case for anything else is impossible to say. 

Your next salary is dictated by you as well as any future employer. Don't accept an offer you already know you will be unhappy with. You need to set the pace in negotiations, don't allow the salary discussion to centre around simply being better than your current job if that is so poorly paid comparatively to the rest of the industry. Instead show that you understand the market value of your profession and your current level within that profession and that you expect a salary offer to be made accordingly. At that point you're just stating facts rather than arguing for some kind of massive raise out of thin air, and if a new employer was expecting to offer a salary for their role that's along the lines of 'fair market value' and you go in and ask for fair market value, it shouldn't be too painful to reach an agreement. 

This falls under the auspices of "Don't badmouth a previous employer". Always good advice regardless of whether or not your previous employer is the same as the prospective new one. I would: Talk about positive things. If asked about the less positive things, then mention what you've learned in order to handle such situations better in the future. You should always look upon any job as a learning experience, and you should always phrase what you've learnt from those jobs in that manner. For example, don't say "job x sucked" or "I suck at jobs like x" but rather talk about how how facing a weakness in x helped you improve, or that you've learnt to play to your strengths in the future. 

To give a good first impression - say yes to every lunch invite you can and listen more than you speak. If they're good employers and good people they will know this is your first professional job and they want you to succeed, because they hired you to solve a problem and want you to be the solution to that problem. No doubt lots of people will be offering lots of hints (some obvious, some not) on how to succeed there. Listen to all of them but think very carefully which 'hints' you act on.
