(If you grab your gut and feel "flab," that is just fat cells, blown up like balloons, with triglycerides inside them.) 

Note that the more modern, trendy wristgps are smaller, but have only data numbers, no map display. (By "map" I mean not a carte, but a white screen with a black line showing your own trail, and also waypoints, lapmarkers etc you save.) (I guess, you could go running with a garmin Dakota, which you hang around your neck (or just shove in your pocket I guess) and that has actual map maps. But it's not as good as a 401!) BTW ..... other than the chart, another HUGE advantage of the old-fashioned 401 over the newer models, is that, you can click to an display of your heartrate (or indeed distance, time, speed, or whatever) that is shown in ENORMOUS, HUGE digits. The digits are much, much, much bigger than on any other wrist-instrument. Perfect for glancing at when pounding along. 

If your aim is purely to burn calories, an exercise bike is fine.1 Thought: consider a rowing machine, which is much tougher and burns even more calories. Regarding the accuracy of calorie calculations: quite simply ALL calorie calculations have a very high margin of error. For instance, if you ride a bike, or indeed go jogging, for X hours, the guess of how many calories burned is very much a guesstimate. Really I'd say the calorie guess on a exercise bike (or a gps watch, or using a formula) is "reasonable". Regarding the relatively unimportant question of which of an exercise bike versus real biking "burns more calories". At some level of comparison, real biking is more irregular, and hence, burns more calories. (Same with jogging versus treadmill.) However, exercise bike is a far more consistent exercise experience. If you go out on a real bike (unless you're a real pro, as SeanDuggan suggests) you're messing around a lot: if you sit down on an exercise bike and actually do it for 30 mins, that's 30 real mins of exercise. (Again, consider instead a rowing machine - perhaps alternate each day?) As long as you stick at it, exercise bike is one of the great basics of aerobic exercise - calorie burning - so sure, go for it. Your question is quite abrupt so I've attempted to guess at what you're really asking. Cheers 

If you are doing your cardio in such a way to be burning fat, you're probably not giving your body enough time to recover from each session. I don't know that this will prevent fat loss, but it's certainly not good for your physical fitness. However, it seems like you may be putting too much focus on the cardio and not enough on the more important component of health & fitness with regards to fat loss: your diet. If you cut out your second 45 minute cardio session each day and dedicate your extra 45 minutes to educating yourself on proper nutrition, you'll be much better off in the long run. 

To put it simply, carbs are going to act as your fuel. Loading up on carbs prior to a run is like filling up your gas tank before driving a long distance. 

I'm on a ketogenic diet and have stopped taking protein shakes (excepting post-workout protein powder with water) because I've heard that it may cause an insulin spike. Is it true that protein powder with water will knock you out of ketosis? The one I'm using in particular is Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey. 

Looking at your diet, you are probably not taking in that many calories. Most of what you're eating is pretty lean, and it doesn't seem like you're eating that much of it. If you want to gain weight, it's simple - eat more! That's it! Here's a look at a diet I used to gain 25 lbs. in 3 months: 7am - 6 whole eggs, 1 cup of oats, banana, protein shake, multi-vitamin 10am - Breakfast burrito w/ 2 eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, cheese, hashbrown, ketchup wrapped in a tortilla 12pm - Lunch (whatever leftovers I had) ex. - Chicken breast w/ brown rice 3pm - Yogurt and peanuts 6pm - Protein shake 9pm - Dinner - ex. Steak and a salad (spinach with olive oil and balsamic vinegar) 

Image from page 25 of this book. Here's a dramatic example of the issue of "where" fat deposits happen. This woman injected two spots on her upper legs with insulin for many years. Two unusual fat deposits grew at exactly the sites of injection! 

Max, you hit on the nature of the debate between the "low-fat" theory (proposed by some departments of the USA government for 20 years or so) and the "low-carbohydrate" theory which was normal science for 200 years and is now promoted by basically all popular books on eating and diet (Carpender, Lutz, Heller, Mackarness, Taubes, Atkins, Eades, etc etc etc). For example, with myself, I eat only a very modest amount of carbohydrates each day. I simply don't eat "new" foods like potatoes, white bread, sugar. I eat an enormous amount of meat, cream, fats, eggs, and green vegetables. (I mean ENORMOUS - for example I eat at least six eggs a day, just for starters.) My caloric intake would be some huge number if I bothered to measure it. But again, ALMOST NONE of the calories come from carbohydrates (sugars). The calories come only from fat and protein. In my case, the weight is just falling off me (easily one KG per week). So you ask "Will simply managing calories be an accurate method of weight control?" In fact no, calories have no connection to weight control. You have to slash or indeed eliminate carbohydrate intake to see the weight come off you. But then again, many people disagree with "pro-fat" (ie, low-carb) thinking, they believe in the USA Government concept of "anti-fat" thinking. So before the question can be answered, you have to decide which camp you are in. the two camps have absolutely opposite beliefs so it's a difficult question to answer. Consider reading the book "Why we get fat" by Gary Taubes. (To get "one side" of the situation.) Hope it helps in some way! 

If you want to build a self-sufficient home gym, here are my suggestions: -Olympic weights (around 200lbs.) -Olympic bar -Bench with barbell rack Optional: -Adjustable weight dumbbells -Pull up bar -Stereo A setup like this is probably the minimum you'd need if you want to be able to get a full body workout and were serious about increasing strength. The equipment I've listed allows you to perform the majority of basic strength training workouts. In addition, you likely won't outgrow it. For example, if you were to purchase resistance bands or set-weight dumbbells, eventually you'd be too strong to get any use out of them. Purchasing I recommend looking on craigslist for people selling them locally. Just search up 'olympic' and you should get good search results. If you buy weights in store, you'll often be paying somewhere around $1 per lb. which can add up, but buying them used can save you good money. After all, metal is metal and it's unlikely any used olympic weights you come across will be in an unusable condition. This may not apply to 'home-gym' cable type set ups. All the weights I have at home are second hand (hell, the bench that I have I grabbed off the side of the road as someone was dumping it). 

As the caption says the dotted curve shows what hypoglycemia looks like (it can cause migraines and similar problems not unlike AnAnt describes), and the solid line shows a healthy person. Conceivably eating just right for a year or so could bring you to the "normal" situation. 

Regarding aerobic exercise (jogging). (i) If you do an enormous amount of jogging (say, two hours a day) that will use a very small amount of calories - i.e., you will be able to additionally eat a small amount of food equal to "that many" calories. However (ii) exercise makes you hungry (far, far in excess of the "amount of calories extra you can eat"...) so exercise is pointless if your aim, as such, is to eliminate body fat. 

It is absolutely impossible to target fat loss to any particular part of your body. Once again, it is absolutely impossible to target where fat will come off. This is at least one piece of fairly well established science. {As a footnote, other than, arguably, the notion of your sex hormone balance - which can affect your overall body shape - women and men have different fat patterns - but that is completely irrelevant to something like "fat on my thighs".} All you can do is smash your intake of carbohydrates, and the FAT on your body will go away, week by week. But it is absolutely impossible to target WHERE adipose tissue is reduced. I have no idea if you are (A) starting to put on weight, and that is happening in your thighs or (B) you just happen to have really large manly thighs (like some people are tall, some people have a big nose, etc). IF the situation is (A), simply smash your carbohydrate intake and exercise more and you will lose the fat from your body, eventually including this fat on the thighs, (To repeat that's only if it IS THE CASE of (A). If it's (B) there is utterly nothing you can do, other than genetic time travel.) By the way, I also have enormous, rather unsightly, thighs! Heh! they look great in a kilt (if you happen to be scottish) but that's about the only advantage. Or, I could easily play say a speed skater in a movie :) 

This could be considered a stretch ,or may not be, but most lifters generally use this machine called the hip abduction. You can find on how to use this machine on youtube. 

Most studies have shown meal timing isn't relevant in terms of weight gain. At the end of the day of course- it just matters on the calories from the specific macronutrients you are eating. That being the case, its probably better to eat the majority of your food during a time you are generally active, or right after a workout, just so you get the energy from the food. The reason you are losing weight is because you aren't eating enough, it has nothing to do with when you eat. Do not worry about your meal timing, just make sure you are eating enough for whatever goals you have in mind ( losing weight, gaining weight). Try to schedule some meals around the times you will workout or do something relatively active, since it might give you a boost of energy. Edit: See $URL$ $URL$ The idea that increased meal frequency contributes to any noticeable caloric loss and thus leading to potential extra weight loss has been debunked and has never been proven by any scientific studies. Please feel free to comment a study that says otherwise, however please make sure it has references. 

must remain in balance. Note that your sex hormones do much more than erect your penis, and your growth or "repair" hormones do much more than allow young people to grow. In short, if your insulin level is too high, in fact your sex hormone level must be too low. If insulin goes up, your sex hormones (and/or growth hormones) must go down. I direct you to Leben Ohne Brot or in English Life Without Bread by Dr Wolfgang Lutz. As soon as the book arrives from Amazon, turn to page 22 and study the chapter on hormone balance, and then the following chapter on insulin resistance curves (interestingly enough some of the charts therein are time series ECG charts, which you will appreciate given your profession!) 

There seems to be a basic problem that you are perhaps confusing these two things: (1) aerobic exercise -- say jogging (perhaps on a treadmill), or exercise bike, or rowing machine, or jazzercise or other aerobics classes (2) weightlifting These two things are completely and totally different. If you are literally every day ... that is 365 days a year ... going to the gym, then you should be doing a lot of aerobics exercise. You can, and should, do that every single day. So maybe swim two days a week, run for an hour two days a week and do jazzercise three days a week .. whatever. Regarding literally weightlifting (ie, to make your muscles large), that is a fairly technical topic. (Note some of the very technical information in Daniel's excellent answer, for example.) If, incredibly, you are literally weightlifting every single day, it's hard to believe you wouldn't have a trainer at least once a month or something. That person would have specific technical ideas on weightlifting science. I mean it could be that you do different groups on different days .. whatever. There's no "broad general rule" like "don't weightlift every day". A footnote - many are trying to reduce body fat. If that's you, it's fine that you're doing aerobics exercise every day, as it will burn a small amount of calories. But don't even bother with that until you slash carbs from your diet and also generally control your calorie intake. As they say "weight loss starts and ends in the kitchen". Indeed, a huge problem is that aerobic exercise makes you hungry: this is a danger if your goal is indeed fat reduction. (Regarding weightlifting, it has no connection to eliminating body fat; it just makes your muscles bigger.) 

It all depends on your goals. Many bodybuilders go through a bulking/off-season and cutting/competition phase. Basically, when they don't need to look cut they pack on as much muscle as possible while gaining a bit of fat. Then when it comes time to look lean, they switch to a fat burning diet that is muscle sparing (ex. Cyclic Ketogenic Diet or a simple calorie deficit). For non-professionals, this usually coincides with winter and beach seasons. If you want to put on mass as fast as possible, you have to accept that some of it will be fat gain. If you want to put on mass while remaining relatively lean, your gains will not be as quick. The approach that I've personally taken (I've had a difficult time adding size as well) is to have massive bulks over the winter where I add lots of muscle, but also a decent amount of fat, then cut down over the summer a bit. Cycle this each year until you get to the body size you want, and at that point you can lean out and maintain. With this approach I've managed to gain 20 lbs. of lean muscle in 2 years (Now at 200lbs. with 10% body fat). If you are relatively new to lifting (ie. less than 3 years of serious lifting), you'll probably be able to see some fantastic results this way. 

Spot Reducing fact is not possible. There is no controversy. Many youtube videos and journals on this. See here Blood Flow and lyposis.. Fat is not converted into muscle. Beginner weightlifters can loose fat, and gain muscle at the same time. Generally after six months this is not possible by 99.99% of the population, unless incredible genetics are present. The idea after losing your "noob gains" (The fact that you are able to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time during your first several months of lifting), is one of the following 

To gain weight by maintaining a caloric surplus. A caloric surplus is generally the only way to gain muscle after the first several months of training. There are other more advanced methods involving recomposition, but this is generally what happens. Note that lifters can expect to gain muscle, and gain fat at the same time, depending on the caloric surplus To lose fat, but expect to lose slight amounts of muscle while loosing fat. I.e caloric deficit 

In short You cant spot reduce fat. You can lose fat. You can gain muscle. But they don't convert into one another. 

If you have no access to a gym (get a membership!) you can try the exercise in the picture below. This will work as the same effect, but make sure you are pausing at the highest point of the abduction. If you are new to this you probably can't raise your legs too high.
