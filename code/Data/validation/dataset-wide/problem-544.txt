Sometimes bike companies don't get things right. Are there any major recalls people should know about? Where can people find information on recalls? There is one answer which has places to find information on recalls (for a given country). Other answers could be by part. (Moderators: I'd like this to be community wiki) 

2.8 is bigger than 2.10. When you run a bigger tire, you have to worry about the tire rubbing on the frame or fork. Running smaller tires are usually simpler. Tire sizes have to be appropriate for the rim width; wide tire on narrow rim could have some control issues/sloppiness (and if you had rim brakes, that could also cause some rubbing). Narrow tire on wide rim could increase risk of damage from hazards. See this page for details: $URL$ 

You'd need to replace the hub (i.e. build the wheel with a new hub -- typically, its better to just get a new wheel), and then respace the frame (i.e. coldset) to take the new hub. It's easy still to find freewheels, so I'd recommend you just replace the freewheel. 

You're paying some amount for the branding of the bike, as well as the bike shop to carry the branding and advertising it and supporting the bike after you buy it. A lot of components can be the same - for example, tons of major brand and non-major brand run complete Shimano 105 drivetrains and various other parts (they may have slight model number changes for OEM versions versus retail versions, but essentially the same stuff). However, there can be some engineering differences though in the parts which are intrinsically the manufacturer's. This is typically the frame+fork - just because you make two frames which look kinda alike out of the same material doesn't mean that they are the same quality frames, or as well engineered as each other for lightness/strength/stability/etc. [Though I'm not saying that smaller branded products are necessarily worse-ly engineered. ] Also, typically, the major brand stuff looks a lot nicer with better resale value if you're into that sort of thing. It is worth saying that while some places (e.g. BikesDirect) advertise a lot of their frames as "compare to (name brand) at (much higher price)", there are trade-offs in what you get. The frame, for example, may have less nice joins, be a bit heavier, use a lower grade of metal, etc. , so its not exactly the same thing (in some cases, good enough, in other cases, a poor imitation). A lot of people often play the argument that all these bikes are made in similar factories in Taiwan or whatever, but they aren't (usually) coming from the same molds, and a factory can produce a decent spectrum of qualities and types of bikes. [Another thing to note is that places like BD don't have the overhead of a retail shop where you may get a bike fit or having to hire people to stand in line and what not] (Unlike in the car world, I don't believe that bicycles are often badge engineered anymore (Schwinn had a bunch in the 70s and 80s for the non-made in USA stuff). But you can get some good bikes from some brands which are cheaper than others.) As for the price difference, a lot is knowing when to buy - if you buy at the right point in time, the price difference is a lot smaller than usual. 

You can run different wheels in the front and back (different brands are fine). Heck, some bicycles have different sizes in the front and back (and are sold that way; 96ers and 69ers are examples)! The only thing you need to make sure is that the wheel fits in the frame and the brakes work. 

This is impossible to determine via the internet - the fit of a bike depends on inseam, arm length, and a multitude of other physical measurements as well as personal preference and the type of bike (there are large variations in types of mountain bikes even) and riding style. Read this article and this article for more details on what goes into bike fitting. Note that its really more of an art than a science. Go to your local bike shop and ask for a bike fit and try out lots of bikes in realistic riding conditions and find one that works for you. 

Some people claim that warming up a torque wrench necessary, but I've never seen it actually seen a manufacturer (Park Tool, Snap On, etc.) recommend a warm up procedure (*) so I don't see it as necessary. I just use torque wrenches/keys directly. As Zinn notes (see for example, Appendix D of Zinn & the Art of Mountain Bike Maintenance 5e), you have a lot of things that can affect a torque reading: 

According to Shimano's website, they are non-series components. However, some websites such as this one claim they are Ultegra quality (This wouldn't surprise me with Colin's answer). In any case, none of the Shimano long reach calipers are part of a series anymore. That being said, TRP (e.g. RG957) among others still make high quality long reach calipers if you're willing to pay for them. 

It depends a lot on you. I live in Illinois and I'll go out in a T-shirt and shorts in the 40's for bike rides. But if you want some additional warmth in the around 40F and 3 miles, I'd say maybe some thin gloves (I have a set of Underarmour coldgear running gloves which are useful for longer rides in the 30s) and a hoodie - you might be cold for the first 2-3 minutes but then you'll feel fine. If you find that a hoodie leaves you cold for the whole ride, maybe add a wind breaker with some ventilating holes. In general, you shouldn't dress enough to feel warm when you're getting on the bike. You'll generate some extra heat, so in most cases, the right amount of clothing will make you feel a bit cold for the first few minutes. A ski jacket is way too much bundling for riding in 40 degree weather (given that its probably overkill for even just standing outside). 

If the key's broken flush and you can't grab it with a pair of needlenose pliers, you should call a locksmith or the police. In all likelihood, they will just cut the lock with an angle grinder or a hacksaw with a diamond blade. Though from the picture, it looks like the lock mostly is open and maybe a good hit with a hammer might dislodge the lock. 

This is actually a mountain bike, despite the name (hybrid referring to having a battery, it seems). You need a 700c (29", ISO 622) rim with a 135 mm OLD hub (a mountain hub spacing) and mounting for discs (your existing rotors are centerlock, so unless you want to use a different rotor or adapter, you should get a hub with that). Width compatibility is another thing to look for -- very wide tire on very narrow rim and vice versa are not good combinations. The freehub should be compatible with your cassette. Note that a wheel that looks extremely out of true can often be made to work well with a bit of adjustment -- unless you're sure the wheel is a gonner, I'd try that first. 

So, basically, if you have 2 wires, chances are you can swap them without worrying and the thing should work. If you have 3, maybe you'll have to disassemble the sensor, figure out which sensor is in there and then look up the pinout (or guess based on color coding of the wires). There are a few more types of magnetic switches, but they're unlikely to occur in this application. 

The cages for a double and triple are shaped differently, so you need to get the derailleur for the right number of chainrings in the front. The derailleur also needs to have enough capacity to shift between the chainrings you have as well as clear the largest chainring. As usual, Sheldon is a good person to start with regarding FD selection. The number of rear speeds (the 9 in 2x9) marked for a front derailleur isn't too important, but the cage of the derailleur may be thinner for higher number of rear speeds (so if your chain isn't designed for high enough speeds, you may have some rubbing on the cage, especially if you don't adjust it properly) -- as Sheldon points out though, the distinction based on number of cogs in the back is primarily for marketing. Obviously, you also need to make sure the derailleur will be able to be mounted on whatever type of mount your frame uses (this includes how the cable is pulled - bottom or top). And finally, you have to worry about cable pull ratio, so if you're using brand X, buy a brand X front derailleur, and if it is a road (mountain) FD, buy a road (mountain) FD if you have road (mountain) shifters (which should obviously be matched with the number of chainrings in the front). In summary, 1) Number of rear cogs doesn't matter - the shifting in the front is effectively independent of whats going on in the back. 2) Number of front chainrings does matter, but there's more to it than just matching the number of chainrings. 

Tire sizing can be pretty important. The first thing to note is that tire sizing that you can run on a bicycle is a function of the rim (the width of it) and the frame (the tire needs a few mm to clear the frame so that it doesn't rub the frame). A rough rule of thumb is that you won't be able to more than 1 or 2 tire sizes up on a road bike from whats originally spec'd (that being said, there are a lot of road bikes which violate this). The second thing to note is that an air filled tire absorbs shocks through its deformation. As Sheldon Brown notes, a properly inflated tire will absorb bumps, have low rolling resistance, not pinch flat (if you have a tube) and keep you in control. The proper inflation of a tire is a function of the size of the tire and the load (weight) it has to carry. For example, on a 26x2" tire, one person may use a pressure like 40 PSI whereas on a 700x20 tire, they may use a pressure of 100PSI+ for cruising around town. A larger tire will use a lower pressure than a smaller one to be properly inflated (and the lower pressure is usually more comfortable). A heavier load or one over rougher ground requires a larger tire. So, fat people shouldn't really be using 700x20 tires, for example (*). 

Unfortunately, you should be using a 11 speed Shimano road FD with a 11 speed road Shimano shifter. SRAM will have cable pull issues. According to Zinn, "a Shimano 11-speed shifter will not work well with a 10-speed front derailleur because the 11-speed shifter is designed to actuate the longer lever arm of Shimano 11-speed front derailleurs." so that cuts out the old days where you didn't have to match the front shifter speeds with the front derailleur. So, you need to find the right Shimano 11 speed front derailleur for your frame (you're looking for "Shimano 105 5800 Braze-On Front Derailleur" (Shimano FD-5800-L) since the Airnimal Chameleon seems to have a Braze On FD). 

I prefer not using anything in the snow to block the snow. You risk the snow packing in the snow blocker (e.g. fenders) and freezing, which can be dangerous. A brush against the tire (depending on the stiffness of the bristles) could also damage your tire. If you want to use something, a seatpost fender and a downtube mudguard are probalby the safest options. If you want to keep your bike clean in winter, good luck (especially if you ride on salted roads). The best course of action is to bring it in when you have time (e.g. 24 hours), clean the bike indoors, let it be completely dry then take it back out. Or, if theres a warm day, do a quick (light) wipe down and dry the bike off as you go. You could also try a stiff brush which may get rid of some of the salt. Or just deal with a dirty bike, and clean it in the spring. 

You can spread steel forks safely (never spread aluminum/carbon fiber), and its not a trivial task to do at home, since you need to keep the fork blades spaced symmetrically and you don't have the same type of leverage available for the rear triangle. Then re-bend the axle mounts, as Criggie points out in the comments. Sheldon Brown has some tips on how to do it (pull the fork apart, check for alignment, use a rubber mallet when necessary), but I'd leave it to a shop if you can find one that can do it. 

The 29ers without front suspension exist, but they are a bit pricey since they come from niche manufacturers. Many people want SS drivetrains since they want pure simplicity. Surly ships some of their complete bikes such as the Ogre as rigid 29'ers (the Karate Monkey can also take gears). There are some other options though. One common option is the Kona Unit which has a derailleur hanger which you can order from Kona as seen here: 

The most important thing for a college campus (and commuting in general in places where there are a lot of potentially not nice people) is to have a cheap bike and locking it properly - in particular, one that doesn't attract attention. Old and scuffed up bikes are best for this. I think an old mountain bike or flat bar hybrid (like a 80s/early 90s specialized hardrock/rockhopper or an old giant boulder is ideal) with a rack attached are pretty good options, along with some slick tires and lights and a helmet. The total for this should be around 210 dollars (lets say 150 for the bike + any work it needs done like derailleur adjustments, possibly new tires, etc., a helmet for 30 and lights for 30). Add 30 if you want a cheap rack, and another 40 or so for a decent lock (say, a Kryptonite evo mini, or if you're paranoid spend a bit more and get a Kryptonitefahgettiboutit). A U-lock is recommended - chain locks give you a bit more diversity for locking things, but they're too heavy to carry around for good ones (and most campuses which are bike friendly have plenty of places where you can ulock to). Fenders/mudguards may also be a decent investment for rain (though college students are a mess anyway, so I don't think it makes much difference). I don't think a road bike is necessarily a great idea given the short distances involved and the not necessarily useful geometry for commuting on most of them. However, if you do find one which you like, take it out for a spin and see how it does. Ask around the community and see whats there for used bike shops and try to find a decent bike there - you'll also probably get some help on fit there as well. Jumping down stairs depends highly on the type of stairs, but it is too reckless behavior for most college campuses. If you are hitting a lot of bumps while commuting, a rigid bike with fat smooth tires or one with front suspension may be helpful (though, I think for 99.99% of commuters, rigid is the way to go). Stay away from full suspension (which you will only find on the Walmart level of bikes). Also, it is good to have non-quick release wheels + seat post.
