I would like to add I'm not sure how to extract the data for just the vo2max intervals or whether that would be more useful or not. Do I train each separately to give myself the best chance of improvement in each discipline? 

If you were to create a power profile based on those seen in training and racing with a power meter by Hunter Allen and Andrew Coggan. What would it look like a sprinter or an all rounder? To help answer the question I have found an article which lists some of the power put out in certain zones by Ryan Trebon during a cyclo cross nationals race. Rider weight: 80kgs estimated ftp is: 415 watts or 5.19 w/kg (rounded up by .25, not sure if that's the right thing to do?) Max power is: 1431 watts The article goes on to state that he produces 'between 400w and 800w, or between about 95 and 190% of his FTP. He accelerated more than 120 times at or near 850w for 20 to 30 seconds (10.6w/kg). 120 times!'. To top it all off 'He goes on to produce 11 more maximal sprints at 1200+w throughout the race, ending with a final maximal kick within the final 500m of 1190w'. Link to the article: $URL$ 

On the one I had, however, it had a seal which meant there was no way the grease could get out. Something important to note is that, if you DO have one of these with a seal on them, don't competely fill it with grease. Where you have moving parts, you want a void and a way for it to 'breathe', otherwise the seal will physically pop. You want more air than grease; Air is compressible, grease (classed as a liquid) is not. If it's not sealed, only a very thin layer. It's purpose is to keep it lubricated and to keep the teeth themselves clean and not directly contacting metal-on-metal, a bad thing in an electric motor which moves very fast under heavy load. If you use too little, the gears will chew each other up, making what little grease there is turn into a grinding paste. Too much grease, and it'll start blurting out of the side, onto other vital, expensive components. Good luck! 

Several times during the year I occasionally have to work night shifts (mostly during winter). This can make longer training sessions difficult as the shifts which allow this type of training ride (+2 hours) that are not days off finish at 1:00am. Going out training at this time in the morning can be fun but I more often than not hit the rollers (deer, drunks and potholes). I would like to get in longer rides this coming winter but am finding sitting on rollers for more than one hour and a half painful. Would a 'top of the range' pair of bib shorts designed for long distance (assos s7) riding help ease the pain? 

Why (if you had the choice) would you stay with cantilever brakes and forgo the opportunity to change to a disc set up for racing cyclo cross? 

My first answer is specific to where you live, I could not mentally justify the big ticket price for a power meter (let alone a garmin as well) but when I found that when stages power meters were coming out with they would be 40% cheaper in US than the would be in the UK/Europe. All this meant I had to do was to be able to afford the power meter, garmin for the data and the book training and racing with a power meter was buy and sell enough power meters to pay for it. This meant I had to trade roughly 20 power meters with a 10% profit margin on each sale to be able to afford my own gear. So I suppose my answer is you have to find a way to pay for it, whether it means selling your older gear and stock piling the cash slowly and little by little or being a bit entrepreneurial. 

I would highly recommend NOT doing something like using a threaded pad in a threadless setup. The threadless setups are commonly called "Cantilever-Style" because cantilever systems are almost ALWAYS going to use the threadless type of pads, except those that specifically say "Cantilever V-Style." If you look on eBay, you'll find this is true if you search 'Cantilever Pads' versus 'V-Brake Pads'. Where you said you had trouble stopping because it took "quite a while to stop," I'd say you either have a bad set of calipers, bad brake levers, damaged cable housings or bad housing stops, as there should be as close to zero flexibility in the brake system. The pads should be 1-2mm away from the rim before you touch the brake lever if they're well set up on a decent set of trued wheels. Then, pull the lever until the pads lightly touch the rim. Then, watch the caliper arms and pull the lever as hard as you can. If you are able to see flex that allows the brake to touch the handlebars, buy a new set of brake calipers or a new bike, because too much flex is ridiculously dangerous. By the way, I HIGHLY recommend changing to V-Brake style systems, as I personally find them far easier to work on. Those pads, the Clarks Elite Tri-Compound, are literally the same ones I use. Be wary that you'll find an increase in the frequency for replacing them, as they're made of a softer material, but note that the power and the reliability that I've had from these pads are well worth that trade-off. Good luck with either you choose, but please do not try to bodge the two worlds of V-Brake style and Cantilever style pads into one. 

To flesh out the question with more (hopefully useful) information: The average speed of this particular local flat criterium race is 47 kph (achievable with a cadence of 90rpm in 46-11) and a peak speed of 58.3 kph (achievable with a cadence of 115 rpm in 46-11). In this instance it would be my first crit race, my expectations would be to not get dropped. I have raced cyclo cross before and consider myself to have a poor sprint. If I was to attempt to win a race like this I think I would have to be on my own. whilst it seems achievable I assume I am missing something key here and there is a good reason why 53-39 on the front appears to be the most common gearing in racing. 

My cantilever brakes have roughly 1mm movement in them and can be moved backwards and forwards very easily by hand. Is this because the shoulder bolt is too long or should the setup have some extra washers in place to stop this? Will braking be improved by changing this? 

However, it's vital that if you take ANY photographs, they need to be of decent quality, have to have good lighting - preferably cold-white LEDs or daylight is even better- and background (No dirty living-rooms or unmade beds in the background, please. Also, please don't put your workshop/garage in shot as almost every photo of a bike with their garage shot in has a horrific mess that, if anything, merely sets off my OCD and makes me not want to look at all.... < /RANT>) It's also handy if you take a photo of the whole bike, and show what products you use on the bike for maintenance (Lubricants, degreasers, cleaners, etc) so that people can see how the bike is maintained. Hardly essential, as a good bike will show in the pictures, but seeing what's used is good reassurance to a prospective buyer. If you're just putting an ad up for a really cheap bike that you want to get rid of, just include the Main 7: 

In the local cycling club some people are keen on racing but are no higher than cat 3 in the events that they can enter and the power that they produce. The general consensus is that motor pacing could be the 'secret sauce' that improves everyone's level of performance before next years race season. Other are sceptical and make the point that its only for people with high enough power outputs that can only be consistently matched by a motorcycle. I agree with this point but cant help but wonder if there is something I am missing, does pedalling at this speed and cadence prepare your legs faster or could the same effects (for cat 4-3 power riders) be achieved by fast group rides? 

Alex Dowsett recently set a new world hour record of 52.937 kilometres, how much power did he have to produce for an hour to be able to achieve this feat? 

I personally do a full bike overhaul every six months, though I absolutely torture my road bike doing off-roading on places I wouldn't even put a mountain bike.... My chain is cleaned thoroughly after every ride, and then stored in a small vat of chain oil to keep it from rusting. (Bad practice, I know, but I'm lazy and like to make sure the chain is ready for every ride. Pull it out, attach it, run it through the cogs a couple of times and then wipe off the excess oil from the chain and cogs and derailleur before the ride.) I'd first remove the wheel, get my cassette lock-ring removal tool and a chain whip and remove the cassette, taking a note of all the positions of the rings. Then, on my cassette, there are little holes that were probably put in for weight reduction; I'd nail each cog onto a big board of ply-board, soak in a strong degreaser and agitate with a brass wire brush, then pressure-washing off everything, then repeat on the other side. (As I said, this bike is tortured, and as such, everything needs a very heavy cleaning...) The free-hub itself I would also replace, too. Every year or so, I replace my chain, chain-rings and cassette, bottom bracket, headset and hub axles/bearings. I personally disagree with using a degreaser on the cassette whilst it's still on the wheel as the degreaser can get into the wheel hub, and much worse, into the free-hub mechanism itself. A more basic way would be to just remove the cassette, degrease it in a plastic tub and leave it to soak for a couple of minutes then brush off with a plastic brush, rinse off and then re-assemble. Place your (I'm assuming) freshly-cleaned chain back on, lubricate the chain and then ride on! If possible, avoid getting oil on the chainrings; only the insides of the chain need lubrication. There is no extreme heat happening on the chain and cassette, so lubrication is not a requirement, and if anything, would hinder the efficiency of your chain by something hilarious like 0.0005 percent because of the layer of oil there. A pathetic number, but another good reason is it'll turn any road dust and brake dust into a grinding paste for your chain. 

If you were to change the rear hub on your hypothetical or real zipp 808 wheel set to a large diameter internal gear hub like a shimano alfine or a rohlhoff hub would there be a measure able aero dynamic effect? 

I just purchased a lezyne super gps and have had no problems on out door rides but indoors where there is no gps signal it refuses to record the data from my power meter. Is there something basic I am doing wrong? 

I've recently upgraded my road wheel set on my cross bike to a set of hope hoops which came with hope mono rs hubs. At first they required me to adjust the rear dérailleur so that the shifting was working properly after a few weeks I finally put my cross wheel set in realising that the rear dérailleur required adjustment again. Is this because the hubs are different sizes or my poor mechanical work. The rear hub on my cross wheel set is a tiagra 4600: $URL$ road wheel set: $URL$ 

Best bet with quick releases when they are hard to remove because of the frame in the way is to get a rag, place it against the frame and then use a long-handled screwdriver to pry it up. That works all the time in the bike-shop I work at. Good luck! EDIT I should actually say, if you have carbon fiber release levers, be VERY careful not to crack/crush it, otherwise that's gonna have to meet the wheelie bin. 

Not sure I'd call that a clutch.... ;) More a freewheel. I have done jobs like this in the past, and I found using a Lithium Grease (very thin, textured a bit like facial cream) works great, so long as you only line it on the teeth. 

As any others have said, nope, nothing will reeeaaallllyyy happen. The only thing you need to worry about is if the water sits for too long on parts such as your chain. Just make sure you buy proper lubricants, and NOT WD40's spray can!!!! ;) Also, if you plan to do that often, it's best to just get a cheap rag and wipe the bike down to dry off most of the water first. Stops the water sitting in places that it probably shouldn't be in!
