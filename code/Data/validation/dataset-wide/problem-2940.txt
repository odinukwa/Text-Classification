The choice of style reflects the need for Spinoza to imply his reader as deeply as he could into the seriousness of the matter at hand. Not just a search for precision, but a plea (and a demand) of austerity. The Ethics is not a commentary(!) and what is more distant from commentary than a mathematical demonstration? The work is a serious and direct challenge to the powers of its time. As little as possible could be left to chance, and this had to be made explicit to a reader that was being invited to a risky journey, possibly without return. 

In this account, qualities of things do not stand on their own, and are also not memories of sensations, but are those elements of reality that can be traced back to sensations, but only as they are abstracted from them, and then rearranged in units of existence that we synthetically call objects of the world, thanks to the presence of signs of reality, which are paradoxically those that cannot be seen, or remembered, by themselves. Interestingly, it is exactly because they are not directly based on sensations that experiences can endure. It is because we have an involuntary (and largely unconscious) theory of reality that we can add coherence to our sensations. 

It seems to me that Boole expresses here a view that was common in his time, of Language as a natural phenomenon, and of Logic as the somewhat idealized structure of (adequate) reasoning. Language may have a theory of its own, based on observation, and because the mind spontaneously reproduces abstract forms in Language (which is why Logic as a human endeavor is possible, to begin with), Language can be instrumental to (a theory of) Logic, insofar this theory is produced by Language-speaking humans. Such a theory of Logic, existing nonetheless independently of Language, could in principle be realized by a different kind of mental process, one that is general enough for abstract reasoning, but not necessarily embedded in Language. He could be hinting at the possibility of "logical machines", that would be entirely within the scope of the speculations of that time. I don't know enough to explain how far has he gone explicitly in that direction, but we all know how instrumental his work has been to the development of the thinking machines we have today. 

In defense of what is sometimes called "obscurantism", particularly in philosophy, it can be said that reason proceeds sometimes by disruption, radical irreverence, noise. It is easy to see that not all said obscurantists are of the same caliber. The same can be said of the defenders of clarity. That said, this is not what the authors you collectively refer to as "postmodern" (a denomination that is, itself, quite... obscuring), particularly Baudrillard, are advancing in their work. They are writing at a time when their readership has largely assumed that consensus in philosophy has already failed as a project, so it can be said that criticism of their work as "hard to read" largely misses the point. Poetry was never a stranger to philosophical thinking. 

As "each and every entity must be conceived under some attribute", the conception of any entity whatsoever implies an expression of the substance. An interpretation could be that substance expresses itself, in entities, in different degrees, according to the abundance of attributes. More substance, more attributes. "Signs" of existence are not actually signs; they are what existence is. That's why def. iv comes to the rescue here. 

The definition of the Church-Turing's thesis is an attempt at capturing the intuitive idea of effective computability or "things that can actually be calculated". It has been said that it is not something to be proven, or refuted, but important assumptions underlying scientific work in many fields of research rely on some version of the thesis, one important case being the linguistic assumption that the semantics of natural languages can be formalized in any significant way. Considering that it is unfalsifiable, should the Church-Turing's thesis be given such an important role in scientific research? EDIT: Thanks for the attention. In response to some of the criticism that the question has received, I'd like to add that, 

Yes, if most women can be shown to reject traditional roles to a very high percentage the moment they are presented with alternate choices and understand them, your statement would hold true. As it stands, not all women are as oppressed as the rest of them and there is nothing contradictory about choosing A or B out of the alphabet of their available choices whilst claiming they are feminists. Whether or not those choices are indeed available to them is another question. Traditional female roles aren't any more oppressive to women than traditional male roles are to men. The oppression comes when you force someone to choose something they do not want or tell them that they cannot choose something, injecting unwanted hardship that cannot be avoided. Feminist philosophers do not have to justify "choice feminism" because some of the most widely accepted tenets of feminism include seeing women as sentient, mental equals, allowing them their choices and subsequently respecting said choice. I realise that there is an argument to be made for women who are genuinely "brainwashed" but you'd have to be some sort of psychological expert to make that call. I could be wrong but I think as a general rule, if a woman somewhere is free enough to openly call herself a feminist, then there's nothing wrong with her then choosing a traditional female role. 

Let's say your definition of the phrase 'choice feminism' is accurate. I submit that your question falls if considered under certain realistic circumstances. For one, (I assume) you are comparing the mental status and choice of a slave long conditioned to his/her position of subjugation whilst possessing little to no recourse to an alternate lifestyle to the mental status and choice of a woman who has not been subjugated or physically kept subservient and also is aware of her potential, innate worth and alternate lifestyle choices. There is an argument of similarity in that, the woman and slave were born into situations where their minds are conditioned to prefer certain things but I think the degree to which the two are comparable is so remote that it is almost absolutely unusable. I assume you are talking about an educated woman in a modern, first-world setting. Realistically, it is acceptable for women to take on these roles because these roles must be fulfilled, whether it be by a woman or a man living alone or in a family. Someone's gotta clean the house and when we tell a family outright that "when a woman does it, the woman is oppressed", I think we are helping nobody. Also, not many people say that a man is oppressed if he chooses a traditional male role and almost nobody demands a man justify his lifestyle choice, so why are we demanding this extra bit from women ? Isn't that a form of oppression ? I've read people arguing that mens' choices aren't questioned because they've traditionally had more of them and women have had less. That may well be true in some places of the world but that doesn't cut it for me in this instance unless we can show the possible choices of a woman to be demonstrably less than that of a man, don't include trends and general statistics of crowd choice. Asking a woman to justify her choice of lifestyle while having no evidence that she is under compulsion or coercion is antithetical to the concept of allowing women greater freedom. I also disagree that nobody would have argued for "choice anti-slavery". In fact, it could be argued that it's cruel to forbid people who have been enslaved for a long time to work as indentured servants (maybe not work for the same person but that's beside the point) because sometimes, that's all they have to move on to greener pastures or a different country. As FreeElk pointed out, the lack or prohibition of choice is the greater oppression here, not the choice or task itself. Secondly, by telling a woman who chooses traditional roles that she shouldn't choose them or that she is no feminist if she does, we are essentially claiming that we know her mind better than she does. We are telling her that someone other than herself understands her situation, thought-process, knowledge and judgement better than she does. While this can sometimes be true, it almost never works when pressuring a free woman to commit to a lifestyle she does not want. The autonomy puzzle is solved when we consider women to be as un-brainwashed as we are (a given concession in almost all cases, I say). I think it's a little condescending to consider women to know so little about themselves and their choices while giving ourselves free rein to pronounce their positions and choices as contradictory. From a purely philosophical standpoint, we are asking women to prove their self-awareness and sovereignty of choice. 

It seems that we have many questions in one here, and my answer is certainly one of many possible. I'd like to quote Charles Sanders Peirce, from an article called "Some Consequences of Four Incapacities" ($URL$ where he states his disagreement with the Cartesian principle of universal doubt: 

To discuss the honesty of the doubt - which is not to argue directly against the doubter as a person, but to require (in abstract) the doubt to be genuine, i. e., not just plausible, but actually existing as an affection. That stance is present in some arguments against cartesianism, for instance, and can be applied to the present case. To argue that even in the absence of certainty, action is still inevitable, and so is responsibility. The refusal to take action based on lack of certainty is unjustifiable, in the same way breaking the law can't be justified by ignorance. As a consequence, doubt is not enough of a reason to proclaim "business as usual"; this attitude must have grounds of its own, and the evidence to support them. 

The substance (of which Spinoza will later state that there is only one, and that it is God) is truly known by the intellect, in its essence, from itself, and by itself, through its attributes. That there are a multitude of attributes is not contradictory to the fact that the substance they express is one: 

Keep in mind that genes are causally related to phenomena occurring in many levels at the same time: molecular, cellular, systemic, individual, social, even environmental. The interplay of all these different levels is not without attrition. More often than not, the existence of a particular trait cannot be reduced to a single explanatory principle. Your premise - that there's nothing to be gained from positive affections on the individual level - is probably unwarranted in itself, but also suffers from a limitation in perspective, as the best utilitarian explanations for the existence of emotions are probably those that investigate the phenomenon at the social level. 

That would be my formula. You might say that this would be a futile endeavor, that to ask "what is...?" questions is as trivial as orange juice, and needs no justification, but I would have to disagree with you on that precise point. You may not believe me, but there was a time when the verb to be, with the meaning that it has today, didn't exist. It is possible to think without it, and without asking "what is...?" questions. At some point, to be became a part of some (not all) human languages. The ancient Greeks tried to understand what it means in a purposeful and systematic way, and the rest is the history of metaphysics. 

In many, many works in linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, philosophy, and obviously in most of what is applied computer science, a more or less conscious leap is made from thought-meaning-behavior... to computable to Turing-computable. It is to this last step that I am referring in this question. This way of thinking, while not necessarily reflective of our better understanding, still enjoys significant popularity within the scientific community (and yes, this is just my perception). The Church-Turing's thesis, not being entirely objective, can still be debated, objected to, even discredited and eventually considered useless (which I believe is what is going to happen, some day), but not strictly falsified. 

I do not dispute Conifold's answer, but would like to add a different perspective. As I see it, and according to what could be understood as a fundamental tenet of structuralist and post-structuralist conceptions of language, it is not just that what constitutes language is how people speak, but also that the human condition itself is created in and through speech. What still intrigues me about your question is the conjugation of objectivity and independence of manifestation. As was conjectured by the comment from David H, only in pure mathematical terms can these two demands be met. In other words, "facts or features of language that exist independent of anyone's actual speech" are a matter of logic, or, if you include virtual manifestations of language (as Peirce has proposed) of theoretical semiotics. In any case, linguistic realism is perfectly compatible with an empirical study of language, it actually would benefit greatly from the absence of Plato from the scene.
