An Evangelical-Pentecostal church has built a huge replica of Solomon's Temple in Brazil. But why Solomon's Temple? What does it have to do with Jesus Christ and the Christian faith? It's very odd to me that they are embracing elements that seem more Jewish than Christian like Solomon's Temple, the Ark of the Covenant and a kippah when preaching. But maybe my idea of Christian traditions is too modern. Have these elements ever been part of any Christian faith? Further information about this replica: It's from the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God that operates in more than 100 countries and was even banned from some African countries. The owner is Edir Macedo, that also appears on Forbes's list of billionaires. He spent 300 M on the construction. Here's the story as covered by The New York Times. Here's the inauguration video, where you can also see how they have used the religious elements I've talked about. 

According to the wikipedia page about the Italian immigration(in Portuguese, but the table with immigrants to each country is very easy to read) the US has received 5,6 million Italians between 1870-1970, Argentina 2,9 million and Brazil 1,5 million. From the same wikipedia page in English: "Italian Brazilians are the largest number of people with full or partial Italian ancestry outside of Italy, with São Paulo being the most populous city with Italian ancestry in the world. Nowadays, it's possible to find millions of descendants of Italians, from the southeastern state of Minas Gerais to the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul, with the majority living in São Paulo state[36] and the highest percentage in the southeastern state of Espírito Santo (60-75%).[37][38] Small southern Brazilian towns, such as Nova Veneza, have as much as 95% of their population of Italian descent.[39]" From the same wikipedia page in Italian, the number of descendants (also easy to read table): "Brasile" = 27 200 000 Argentina = 19 700 000 "Stati Uniti" = 17 250 000 The page about American Italians (in EN) confirms 5,5 million Italian immigrants to the US. 

I have a new theory and maybe people reading this can give me more input about the situation of Italians in the US. I think Brazil and Argentina, especially Brazil due to its vast amounts of land, has given Italians more space for developing their communities. Nowadays a lot Italian Brazilians own a lot of land. My guess is that the Italians that went to the US ended up working in industries and afterwards staying in cities and never really owning farms. The fact that Italians going to Brazil went to work on coffee plantations mainly, also means the group stayed together and isolated in farms, which means Italians in Brazil preserved cultural - even their language - and genetic heritage longer than in other places. This also would explain why Argentina too has more Italians descendants than the US, while the US received many more Italians than Brazil and Argentina combined. Mainland Brazil was probably much less occupied than the US when the immigration of the beginning of the last century occurred. This would explain why Italians ended up owning land and also other groups such as Germans, which also were able to preserve their language. Obviously maybe the way of considering who is a descendant has a huge impact on the numbers. Anyways, for me to confirm the above mentioned theory, I need to be sure the Italian Americans indeed ended up never owning much land and staying in cities and therefore having had much less resources to multiply their communities. 

What does this change? What outstanding questions are likely to be answered as a result of the discovery? 

There is a lot to learn about a society from its buildings, especially if you know what they are used for. For example, find the largest and most decorated buildings (not meaning just decoration, but things like enormous windows, big halls, dramatic stairways, no smaller buildings near them). Are they: 

Also look at the features of these important buildings compared to the same buildings elsewhere or at other times. For example, most castles in England were clearly defensive buildings, with thick walls, arrow slits, drawbridges etc. The chateaux of the Loire Valley are enormous buildings, but are basically just houses: if they have moats they tend to be a "water feature" more than a defense mechanism. They don't have arrow slits, or places for an army to gather before a battle. They have tons of doors and their great rooms are for dancing, not for the village to huddle together during a siege. All of this is obvious from the building itself, and tells you a lot about what life was like at that time in that place. Also look at the large but non decorated buildings. Are they for living in? Working in? What happens a LOT (so you need big buildings) but isn't considered very important (so they're really nothing special)? You can also look at the arrangement of buildings. Is everything centred around that big church or mall or stadium? Can you see it from everywhere else? Did the city grow from the waterfront back towards the hills? What is on the edge of town and what is in the heart of everywhere? Are there different parts of town for different things? Then examine at the building level. Are activities mixed that other societies separate? For example, people once used to keep their animals in the same buildings as themselves. In some places, people work at home or live at work, and in others such activities never mix. In some houses there is a schoolroom to educate the children of the house: in others the children go to a completely different place to learn. How many bedrooms are there? How many bathrooms? In an office building, are there gender-segregated bathrooms? In an office building, are there large meeting rooms? Are some offices larger than others? Is there a room for recreation? Is there an attached daycare? Is there a place to put your bicycle? Does a residential apartment have a balcony? Is it for sitting on with a glass of wine, or for growing tomatoes? Now all of this is harder when it's historical and you don't know what people did in the buildings or what the rooms were for. But you find stuff in the ruins, and maybe you have art showing things in use, and you can piece together a lot that way. While it may not come up in general conversation, studying buildings from long ago is one of the ways your history textbook came to know the things it states to you so calmly as fact. Did most families own slaves? Were home vegetable gardens an important source of food? Did every village have a market square? Were the buildings near the docks mostly businesses with no-one living there? All that information is likely to have been pieced together by studying buildings. They just don't tell you in the book how they come to know these facts, instead concentrating on telling you the facts.
