Then MN 62 gives a very powerful analogy, which helps the mind: (i) remain grounded in the physical elements of the body (including the breathing) and; (ii) remain non-attached, non-craving & non-judgmental. It states for each of the five elements: 

The Pali is 'kataññutā' & also 'kataññutā kataveditā'. 'Kataññutā' means 'what others have done for us'. 'Kataveditā' means 'what we must do in return'. 

As for the belief that "rebirth" occurs after the termination of life, similar to visions of schizophrenia, in my opinion, this also arises from "mental illness", as the term was used in the Buddha's time, i.e., illness of view or desire. 

No, it was not jhana. Feelings of bliss are not necessarily always 'jhana'. However, the bliss arose due to the cessation of anxiety. It was not jhana bliss however it was certainly a kind of bliss. 

Jesus coveted another religion, as shown by the report of entering the Jewish temple and violently turning over the tables of the money-changers. Both the covetousness and violence is not the serene & perfect conduct of a Buddha. Jesus used supernormal miracles to covert people, which is forbidden in Buddhism. The Buddha compared such behaviour to a prostitute exposing her vagina for a silver coin. Jesus did explicit not teach the Four Noble Truths, Three Characteristics and Emptiness. Jesus did not establish a Vinaya (Code of Conduct), which is why Christian clergy can engage on sexual misconduct, war & other crimes without expulsion. 

An answer to this question is in the Khajjanīya Sutta. The Khajjanīya Sutta explains life is comprised of five aggregates, namely: (i) body; (ii) feelings; (iii) perceptions; (iv) mental formations; & (v) sense consciousness. Mental stories about so-called or imaginary 'past lives' are 'mental formations', similar to dreams the mind constructs or manufactures in sleep. The Khajjanīya Sutta states 'mental formations' about the past should be interpreted as follows: 

I disagree with you about 'mano puggmama dahma mano setta mano maya' in the Dhammapada, which is about the mind creating intentional actions (rather than about the mind creating illusion). 

The 'self' is an idea/assumption born from craving for & attachment to things (Parileyyaka Sutta, paragraphs 9 to 11). When the things attached to pass away (due to impermanence) there is suffering because of the 'self-clinging' or 'self-identity' with those impermanent things produces the sense of 'loss'. The Nakulapita Sutta explains this very well & simply. Therefore, yes. The purpose of anatta is to produce not-clinging to end suffering & reach Nibbana. The Anatta-lakkhana Sutta answers your question, particularly the last paragraphs (below): 

Therefore, every time consciousness functions, it is "real consciousness" because it performs the function of 'cognizing'. It does not not-cognize, it does not digest food, it does not walk, it does not speak. Consciousness only cognizes & discerns, which is why it is real consciousness. The fact that the arising, existence & functioning of consciousness is dependent on causes & conditions, such as a mind & body (nama-rupa), sense organs & sense objects does not make consciousness not a real thing. Consciousness is a real thing because its reality is it cognizes and the only thing it does or is is cognising. Importantly, real consciousness is an essential requirement for real wisdom or real insight. Therefore, real consciousness or real cognizing does not bring suffering. Instead, real consciousness brings true enlightenment. 

Personally, I do not believe there were any Buddhas before Gotama. This is why there is probably no evidence. The idea of past Buddhas is found only a few suttas among thousands, where, in those suttas, the technology mentioned, such as chariot-making or potting, was the same as in the Buddha's time. 

Volition is an act of will or decision to act. The volition may be produced from both ignorance (not-knowing) & wisdom. There are three kinds of actions born of volition: (i) thoughts; (ii) speech; (iii) physical movement. All actions start with a thought (mental action), which is why the Dhammapada states: 

Thus, at a primal level, for every unenlightened living being, craving serves the main objective (of nature) to survive and to reproduce. As for the enlightened, they survive more skilfully relying on wisdom rather than craving. 

Yes. Teachers can disappoint us when they do not act with the virtue & care we expect however this gives us an opportunity to be more firm & mature in our own virtue & care. Even if a public humiliation resulted in your mind eventually abandoning 'false-self', this does not mean you should engage in this cultish behaviour. 

Sutta such as MN 62 makes it clear the elements of earth, wind, fire & water refer to solidity, moisture, heat & movement/force. I think 'elements' is a good translation for 'dhatu' because it fits with modern science. 

Good moral conduct is extremely important because, although it, in itself, does not bring the goal, the goal cannot be reached without it. 

Below are pictures of unsatisfactoriness; i.e, undesirable things that cannot bring true lasting permanent happiness. 

Whenever there is some communication, there must be some awareness (however that awareness may not be fully reflective, like human awareness can know emotions but not act upon those emotions). For example, some plants know when an insect lands on them and they close up to eat the insect. These plants must have some awareness, however primitive. 

Yes, it is the most important sutta because it represents the core message of dukkha & no dukkha (MN 22); the 'Handful of Leaves' (SN 56.31); & the 'Special Unique Teaching' (MN 56) the Buddha declared only he taught. While the 2nd sutta SN 22.59 about the 3 characteristics is more profound & has more path efficacy, both SN 56.11 & SN 22.59 share the same goal, namely, explaining wrong view vs right view and leading to the end of suffering. 

Well-developed Buddhist samatha-vipassana meditation cleanses the body & mind from mental impurities such as greed, lust, hatred, anger, delusion, etc. Also, to practise samatha-vipassana successfully requires lots of self-love or self-compassion. Thus, when the true results of samatha-vipassana meditation are developed, what will remain is bliss & love. In summary, when unwholesome emotions are cleansed, what naturally will remain are wholesome emotions. Therefore, one does not really need to complement samatha-vipassana with other techniques to develop those qualities. Often, sympathetic joy, loving kindness, compassion, etc, need to be developed when there are hindrances to samatha-vipassana. But if there are no hindrances to concentration, those qualities will be included in the natural results of samatha-vipassana. 

Above, the house-builder is 'craving' & the house built is 'ego-existence' ('jati'). Yet the view of the questioner is probably 'backwards', i.e., the questioner probably believes ego produces craving rather than craving produces ego. If this is true, the questioner should urgently refer to SN 12.12: 

There are three types of kamma, namely, bodily, verbal & mental (refer to AN 6.63). As soon as intention & attachment arise in the mind, this is mental kamma & such mental kamma will have a result or destination. For example, by mere thinking alone, a neurotic person may have a psychiatric hospital as their destination. Therefore, as soon as ignorance & aversion result in intention & attachment, this is kamma. 

In Buddhism, morality equates with harmlessness. Morality is not a commandment or doctrine but, instead, harmlessness. To understand morality, one must comprehend harmlessness. If harmlessness is not comprehended, it is difficult to maintain morality. Buddhism explains when you are moral, you no longer harm yourself. Being moral is a method to love yourself & benefit yourself. If you examine with reason & intelligence the behaviours Buddhism considers to be immoral, such as killing, stealing, promiscuous sex, lying, drug taking, gambling, etc, you will find people who engage in these actions bring suffering & problems to their own lives (and, of course, suffering to the lives of others). For example, men go to war, return with PTSD & even commit suicide. People who steal, end up in prison or lose their jobs. People addicted to promiscuous sex end up with broken relationships & mental disorders. People who lie are not trusted (even though they make money as evil politicians or business leaders). People who take drugs destroy their lives with bad health. People who gamble & borrow money greedily end up ruined. Therefore, in Buddhism, we reflect or think deeply about the harmful consequences of immoral behaviour. In addition, in Buddhism, another method to become moral is to develop 'empathy', namely, 'putting oneself in the place of another'. For example: 

This is why sexual fantasies are 'misogynistic' according to the Dhamma because they are based on the intention to harm women rather than the intention to have metta (loving-kindness) for women; and they are based in making a woman submissive to the desires of men rather than giving authority/dominance to the woman in a male/female relationship. 

Yes. Genuine emptiness is the death of the self-instinct, which most minds cannot do. This is why some people have psychosis at meditation retreats or when taking hallucinogens, such as LSD. The self-instinct accords with ordinary nature. Where as emptiness is contrary to 'the world'. 

Some Buddhist scriptures state by doing good you can go to heaven & by doing evil you can go to hell. Also, if you love the Buddha, you can go to heaven. 

In his discussions with Brahmans (MN 95; DN 13), monks (MN 38) and even lay people (AN 3.65), the Buddha often condemned the idea of blind faith or unsubstantiated beliefs. 

Yes. However, the word "birth" here does not refer to physical birth but to the mental birth of the "self-view" or "egoism". Nirvana is the end of self-view, egoism, conceit, I-making & my-making, as explained in many suttas. 

This can be done by learning about & reflecting upon the Buddhist teachings about relationship. By doing this, we can learn about the mistakes we make in our past relationships & the way forward for the future. For example, if we can see the necessity of the Buddhist qualities prescribed for a suitable partner, we can realise our previous partner never did have the qualities or abilities to fulfill our expectations. But doing this, we may stop blaming them & instead focus on our own choices. The main teaching of the Buddha can be read in AN 4.55 however the link already provided explains the main relevant teachings of the Buddha. 

In Buddhism, most simply, enlightenment is seeing how attachment & self-view is suffering; in such a way that attachment & self-view are given up or dropped by the mind. 

I think the question is unimportant because Buddhism does not provide an answer for this question & because in Buddhism there is a path for laypeople that can be practised by both heterosexual & homosexual people. I personally know gay people who are very spiritual, very moral, very faithful to their partners & extremely compassionate. In short, there is no inherent correlation between casual sex, infidelity & homosexuality. 

When the suttas used phrases, such as "remains focused on the body", this is a pre-occupation of mindfulness rather than mindfulness itself: 

Note: This does not conform with the original Buddhism of the Buddha, which is only concerned with eradicating craving & self-views rather than eradicating all discrimination (which the Buddha rejected as Nirvana). 

When the mind or person experiences 'suffering' ('dukkha'), which 'aggregate' ('khandha') is producing this suffering or which aggregate does this suffering fall into? 

Those facts or absolute truths of Buddhism are considered to eternally & inherently exist, even if they are not comprehended or known by the human mind. At SN 12.20 & AN 3.134, the scriptures say about the natural laws of the Four Noble Truths (Dependent Origination) & the Three Characteristics (impermanence, unsatisfactoriness & not-self): 

In conclusion, intellectual or 'book' knowledge of Buddhism alone, even if it is Right View, cannot result in stream-entry because, as described in every example above, the mind of the stream-enterer must be free from the five hindrances and, more importantly, must have the experience of nirodha (cessation) and taste Nibbana. For stream-entry to occur, as described in MN 117, Right View plus the meditation factors of Right Effort & Right Mindfulness must function together in unison: 

In Buddhism, the ten skilful kamma are non-killing, non-stealing, non-sexual-naughtiness, honest speech, pleasant speech, cordial-non-divisive speech, beneficial speech, non-greed, non-hatred & non-delusion. Apart from this, there are many other lists, such as in the Sigalovada Sutta. In Buddhism, everything is determined on the basis of causing suffering/harm & leading to freedom from suffering/harm, which can be known via personal experience. Refer to the Kalama Sutta. 

Metta practise is part of the 2nd and 6th factors of the eightfold path, namely, the practise to develop loving thoughts & give up hateful & angry thoughts. If the mind has hateful & angry thoughts, it cannot meditate or concentrate. Therefore, metta is a foundation or preliminary practise for the four foundations of mindfulness
