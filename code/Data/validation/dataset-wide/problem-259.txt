In your world, women tend to have positions like that of the head guard The weapon of your head guard seems to be a standard for the role, not just something selected by the individual Assuming you are using humans as we know them, on average women have 50% of the upper body strength of men. The Estoc is a long, heavy weapon primarily used for thrusting against armored opponents 

This comment too long, so I'm posting it in the answers area. This is not an answer to the main question itself, but hopefully it will be enlightening. Note: I do not believe a true answer is possible with the Science-Based tag in play. In your question you talk about stretching space and time until you create a tear. Obviously how the tear itself is made is stuff of Science Fiction and not going to stand up to the Science-Based tag, but let's allow that one aspect to stand. How the Tear Came About: Build Something Denser than a Black Hole (Sci-Fi) Black holes create such an stretch space-time to such a limit that our current mathematics start to treat many aspects as "infinity". Let's apply Science-Fiction for a moment and assume that you made something "more massive per unit area than a black hole", taking those numbers beyond infinity and ripping a hole in space-time. At this point physics and mathematics cannot identify what would occur. We can, after all, only create hypothesis about the observable universe, but this would be - by definition - a view into something outside the known universe. The fact that it obeys our physical laws at all is frankly astounding. Here's where we start to (loosely) use the Science-Based tag. Let's talk about antimatter/gravity interaction (reference the link for the next three cases). Caveat 1: Once we start talking about a hole in space-time, I'm going to assume that there aren't unforeseen consequences like gravity or time stopping/warping everywhere. Those would be interesting topics to write about, but it sounds like you're going for "business as usual" everywhere else. So let's assume the hole is only locally significant. Caveat 2: Whatever exists beyond the tear is pretty much by definition not from our universe, so frankly I'm surprised that it manifests as something that follows the same laws of physics as our own universe (it doesn't have to). But maybe there's a meta-universal reason for it we just aren't aware of. So I'm assuming that the other universe has the same laws of physics... it's just full of anti-matter. Case 1: The Leading Antimatter/Gravity Theory Holds* Currently the standard theory of antimatter/gravity interaction is that antimatter reacts to gravity in the same was as regular matter. We haven't been able to demonstrate it yet, but that's the leading theory. If that is the case, on our side of the superdense region you created we see it as a black hole. On the other side they would see about the same thing. The black hole would then be sucking in both matter and anti-matter. Assuming (as it sounds like) the other universe is just wall-to-wall antimatter and that the hole on our side opened in space (where there is very little matter), the black hole would eat antimatter quickly until it lost so much mass that it stopped being a black hole. At that point either the hole to the other universe closes or it remains open. It's worth noting that if the hole remains open, the door between this universe and the other is only as large as the black hole that made the tear... anywhere between 0.1mm - 400au. Case 2: Anti-Matter is Repelled by Gravity In this case the other universe would have a hole suddenly pop up that repels that universe's standard makeup (antimatter), so presumably none would be hitting the black hole to wear it down. The result would be no "leakage" between universes. Case 3: Anti-Matter is Attracted by Gravity, but At a Different Rate than Matter At the end of the day I think this basically devolves back to Case 1. As long as there is attraction and a sufficient supply of anti-matter the black hole would eventually cause the black hole to evaporate. Aftermath This is more or less the range of possibilities available for your story. If you created a very large black hole (eg. 400AU) on Earth or anywhere in the vicinity, you would wipe us all out in an instant. On the other hand, if you created a pinprick you would get very little anti-matter out of it, so that may not be entirely what you want either. Another, far more concerning, area of concern is what happens when the black hole evaporates as a result of the antimatter. Per Wikipedia "a 1-second-lived black hole has a mass of 2.28 × 10^5 kg, equivalent to an energy of 2.05 × 1022 J that could be released by 5 × 10^6 megatons of TNT" - though we could halve that if we assume half the energy were released into the other universe (we see 2.5 x 10^6 megatons of TNT worth of explosion). Let's put that in perspective. The largest theoretical nuclear weapon can deliver only 1,300 megatons of explosive - still multiple orders of magnitude less than the destruction of this black hole. Worse, a 228,000kg black hole would only have an event horizon radius of 3.386 x 10^-22m (1.333 x 10^-20 inches), which maybe doesn't play out very well when you consider how little anti-matter is going to come through a hole that size in realistic time... especially when it needs to come out of a tear a VERY GREAT DISTANCE from Earth. In Conclusion Even allowing for some hand-waving to enable a tear in the universe using a black hole, I just can't justify a science-based tag. So you're going to have to find a different way to rip the fabric of the universe. You probably were going to anyway, but hopefully this thought-experiment demonstrates why this particular route would have no good science-based ending. 

The Poorest Would Benefit, but Only Marginally Let's say a 35-year-old weighs 250lbs - a big guy. Let's assume that about 45% of that is muscle and it is all harvestable, netting 112.5lbs of food. At 800 dollars per 112.5lbs, the meat costs 7.11 dollars per pound. This does not even counting the markup incurred by processing, transporting, and selling the meat, which would probably quadruple the price given the cost-to-product ratio per carcass - so let's call it $28 dollars per pound. Even in this extraordinarily generous case that is an EXTREMELY expensive food source. So the poor would benefit by having more spending money, and only the wealthy would consume human flesh due to the cost. Since there are no known benefits to eating human flesh, the wealthy would not receive any benefit from the act and would distribute more of their wealth in its acquisition. Unfortunately there would not be a huge global market for the meat due to its cost, so surprisingly little economic change would result. As for why the poor would benefit more than, say, the middle class the answer is simple: 800 dollars means a lot more to a poor person than to someone in the middle class. 

With all that said, given that you are a Kardashev Type II society there are a number of gestures that could be possible to you. Note: we are well outside the realm of "hard science" at this point. If you propose that your society uses Star Lifting to attain it's K-II status, for example, you have access to considerable amounts of matter, energy, and possibly even anti-matter. If you can harness it to push a dwarf planet into one of the white dwarves you might be able to trigger a supernova of this type. Note again that it would still take a lot of time for charged pushing material to make it to your white dwarf! Gravity from the other white dwarf can then help slow down the resulting nebula, and if the mated star survives it would obviously be a handy source of power for your vessels. Of course, it could also be blown apart or supernova itself - both are options! 

You Have to Stretch some Laws of Physics If you want a true deep-space ship (eg. nothing around you, not even asteroids, for hundreds of light-years) your crew is doomed. At some rate your ship will emit energy to space around you in the form of radiation, which will add up over time. In addition, versus the vacuum of space you will lose small molecular gasses straight through your hull! That loss will primarily be in the form of Hydrogen, which you won't miss much until your water supplies start to run low. If we stretch science a bit... Perhaps you could find a way to spot and track asteroids and even rogue planets outside of solar systems. You pick up and process those sources as you go along to replenish supplies. Being a generational ship the planets you come across are presumably not fit for human habitation, but they could still contain ice and other elements/minerals you need. A real-life example of such a planet would be Europa. As for the basic problem that your power sources are going to run low at some point... well, I won't mention it if you don't.
