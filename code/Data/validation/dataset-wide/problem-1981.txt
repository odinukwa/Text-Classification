Intern positions are jobs, not company sponsored study time. Part of the purpose of an internship is to learn the ins-and-outs of the corporate world including time management and the separation of work and non-work time. That includes learning to blame ones self for time management fails, not look for excuses. Though interns are often given a break, such as a couple hours to slide so they can study for an exam, this is more a trade off as they are not full employees so get a break. Three weeks is way beyond that, and is more than bending over backwards. I would have to fully agree with your boss, and frankly he should make if clear to you that really, that can't happen again. An hour here or there in consideration, maybe, but that is all. It is his responsibility to make time, not yours to find time for him. If he cannot see this, he failed the exam, the dissertation, and his internship and the lessons it was supposed to teach him. 

Something to add: there's a local large tech company in my area where the employees have an old saying, "it's the best first and third job you'll ever have" Meaning: there's rules in place on how large your salary can be and how much you can be promoted to that apply to existing employees, but not necessarily to people hired from the outside. For example, you might make $50k and your manager wants to promote you to a position where you can make $100k. However, the company has a rule: no more than a 50% pay increase. Which means you can't be raised to more than $75k. Crestfallen, you take a different job outside the company that offers you, say, $85k which is still less than the $100k you should have been promoted to but better than the $75k you were actually promoted to. After a few years though your original manager approaches you and can now successfully offer you the $100k because now you're no longer a current employee and so he can give you what the position deserves. It may sound stupid, and in the short run it probably costs the company some good employees, but in the long run it saves money (which is good for the accountants, stock holders, etc.) It also has one added benefit: it helps curtail the notion that managers can give giant raises to people they like based on things other than skill. I once worked a job at a company that didn't have this rule and we got a new director of our division one day and he brought in his crew of fellow coworkers from his old division and gave them all management positions with enormous raises and bonuses, despite their complete lack of qualifications. You can probably guess what happened next. So anyway the bottom line is that yes this is a thing, yes it may be antiquated or not properly account for highly demanded talent or what not but thems the breaks. You have to decide if you like the job or money more. 

Double check the recruiter's phone number. Are you sure you haven't got it wrong? Have you tried emailing the recruiter? Do you have the recruiter's company details? Can you call his office / head office / boss / etc? 

This really depends on why they want a reference. Usually, references are taken up to prove two things. 

Your manager is busy. All managers are. You are not the only person they are responsible for. One of your jobs is to make life as easy for your boss as possible. Happy boss = happy you :-) So, you need to understand how your boss works and what will motivate him and keep him happy. You could just send him an email. But I bet he gets hundreds and will find it very easy to ignore. Consider the following... 

I agree with the others in that you need to present the case properly, and also that if you're trying to help your company after you leave but they won't take your suggestion then it's no longer your problem. You tried. That said the one thing every company and department understands: money. I mean, money is I'm guessing the reason they won't buy the software (your question's wording is a little vague so I'm guessing about this part). And if it's cheaper to have people on staff to do the job than it would be to buy the software to automate their tasks then yeah, they're going to go that route, it's the most finanically rational. However if this isn't the case, if it would be better and cheaper to use the software then that's your angle. Same way if you had to write a video game it may be cheaper to license a game engine than it would be to hire a team of people to write it over however long it takes. Barring some sort of "not invented here" directive (justified or not) the way to make your case is money. If the issue is no one's going to do your job once you leave then explain how much money they're going to lose when things go wrong versus the costs of buying the software. 

How much it may or may not hurt your career really depends on the environment and what career paths are available. There are many organizations which view programmers as a lower tier and if you stay a programmer you are greatly limiting your ability to advance at least within that organization. In these shops, advancement requires progressively relinquishing technical responsibilities for management. Other shops have parallel paths that will allow advancing while remaining purely technical or moving to a more management path. I myself am in a more hybrid environment where people can advance down either path but while staying technical you are still expected to pick up more project management responsibilities while technically guiding projects to the best practices and technology. To know how much it will hurt your long term advancement, you need to weight the actual structure or your organizations and even within that if one path regularly outpaces another. Add to that your own skill sets, not just what you like, but what you are actually good at or can become good at. In many environments, mine for instances, titles like senior software engineer is steadily reducing how much actual programming that person does, instead they design the application and supervise if a contractor is implementing it to their specification. In my case, do I like that direction, not especially, but I have to balance between my goals and the organizational needs and then determine what I want to do and if the organization is the right place for me. I at least have the safety net that my organization has made it clear that the added duties of a promotion are optional and can be declined. I still know that they are the actual needs of the organization so it puts pressure to accept of move aside. To truly know though, I think you need a good idea of the organization's needs and goals and how they see you fitting in. 

If you've automated yourself out of a job, your company needs to find more jobs for you to automate your way out of. 

I agree with the consensus here that the client acted poorly. However, one additional detail that I latched on to in your story 

You already have some excellent answers above, but I'm going to make one additional observation/suggestion. You have what sounds like a standard issue full time flat salary job. I've got one. Most people on this board have one. And judging by your statements you seem to be wanting to get paid more as a result. Or rather, you don't want to be working those extra hours for free. It sounds like the same thing but the added wrinkle is that compensation comes in forms other than money. I don't know what your financial situation or commitments are but it sounds like you'd be a pretty good fit for a startup culture. Crazy long hours, beyond-Puritan work ethic, deep personal investment in the company, it sounds like the sorts of things people in startups go through. Not to sound cliche but this is the sort of thing the guys on Shark Tank look for. The downside though is that startups frequently pay a lot less than standard full time jobs for established companies, and there's almost never any such thing as overtime pay. You would likely be taking a very substantial pay cut to join one, and this is why you tend to see younger people flocking towards them (i.e., people who maybe haven't yet entered into a marriage/mortgage/family situation). The perk though is that you are frequently offered stock options or ownership in the company as a result (sometimes called "sweat equity"). Back in the day people would work for Microsoft for $30k/year in Seattle and stock options. When Microsoft hit it big they cashed out and became millionaires. Of course that's assuming the startup succeeds. So it's a gamble. But it's an option. 

I think you have already answered your question. You had a task, you quoted a price, they agreed. You did it. Now, you have a 2nd issue, you may want future business if it is available. If so, them maybe you consider offering a discount on future work because this job proved more straight forward than expected. I personally would only consider that if you think the chances of additional contracts exist, or referrals, or if you think the trick you did here can be duplicated in the future. Offering such a discount is tricky though as yes, this job proved easier than expected, but the next might be more difficult and you will not be paid extra on that one. You should price yourself on average jobs and the easy ones balance the tough ones. 

I think this is a clear sign that there's more to this story, and assuming the deal is that there's something they're not telling you (as opposed to something you're not telling us), I wonder if this is a sign that the company does not have the money to pay you with money in the form of a check, but may be willing to pay you in some debt-related fashion (i.e., maybe the items they'll buy for you will be put on a credit card). If the issue is that they want to pay you with a credit card and not with an actual check, maybe invoice them with PayPal or something? I've done this where the client is clearly paying me with a credit card via PayPal and there's a slight hit involved with PayPal fees (maybe adjust your invoice to account for it) but overall everyone's happy. I think it goes without saying that this company is not one you want to work for again. 

Go speak to your current boss now. Tell her that you're not happy with the medical coverage offered and that you are finding the commute harder than you thought. Explain that, because of these problems, you'd like to find a way to gracefully end the employment. She may decide that you should stay for as long as possible - to ease the pressure while they hire. She may decide that you should clear out your desk right there and then. She may ask you to wait until the end of the week. 

The paint fumes are unlikely to be toxic (I hope!) - but it would be worth carrying out a Health and Safety check just to make sure. In extreme cases, paint fumes in enclosed spaces can kill. The best way to get rid of smells is not to cover them up. We're at the tail end of summer now, so I would suggest keeping your windows open for as long as the weather remains mild. Improve the ventilation, have someone in looking after the building over the weekend while you air it out. And get some plants to cheer up your employees :-)
