Folks, I'm in a bit of a jam. I am writing a fictional future history to support a series of post-collapse science fiction stories set ca. 2560 Gregorian. The first story, The Borax Road Affair, has been accepted for publication in the forthcoming anthology After Oil 3: The Years of Rebirth from Founders House Publishing. This world, which I'm calling the "Circumpolar", is a set of civilizations that have grown up around the "Polar Sea" (their name for the now ice-free Arctic Ocean, which has become the maritime crossroads of the world.) Now that I'm writing the history, mainly in order to provide migratory and linguistic backgrounds for the populations of the Circumpolar, I need to track some kind of believable climate development over the centuries. What I'm looking for is a whole-earth, system-based climate modelling program. It needs to work with our planet, not with an invented planetary surface. I'm having rotten luck finding useful resources - mostly it's just well-intentioned (but useless to me) sites that will allow me to Calculate My Carbon Footprint. My carbon footprint is irrelevant to this project. I need the planetary picture for centuries out. Another very real problem: the underlying climate models on the few climate modelers/calculators that I've been able to find do not allow midstream parametric insertions that can modify the run. What I need, particularly I'd prefer an online modeler if possible. If I need to run it offline, preferably something written in Python or Java. I do not need predictive confidence and power. I just need scientific plausibility. Specifically, I need to be able to provide: 

I'm sorry, but you need to change your story. I think you can, and I hope you do: from a dramatic standpoint, it's a hell of a good tale in the making. However, you have set your protagonists up to attempt something that's just not reasonably plausible. You burden them with inventing, from scratch, too many things that just can't be invented that way. I have been a sailor on submarines, yachts, an oceangoing tug. Until you've actually been to sea, it's hard to get your mind around just how damned much there is to know. I really like the answers from @James and @bowlturner, and won't bother to add more critical or significant prerequisites. But please do review those lists. Your challenge, as I see it, is to retain the dramatic narrative, but back off on the intractability of the problem. And really: the Sea provides enormous amounts of drama, without layering impossible and unrealistic challenges on the protagonists. You can relax the stringent constraints that you have declared, and it will still work. You have the bones of a pretty thrilling story there. 

Although many good thoughts have been added already I would just like to add my input from my experience with a 12th century reenactment group that I was a member of for a number of years. The reenactment was more skill based than scripted and we trained 2 times or more per week with blunted versions of the weapons that they would have had back then. We had a number of female members, many high ranking who also participated in the combat (though dressed as men with hoods or helmets to hide the fact they were female). Regarding strength; it is true that women don't tend to be as strong as men on average and that we build muscle more slowly due to having less testosterone but with continued training it doesn't take too long to become adjusted to heavier weapons and armour. Things like spears and shields tend to be as light weight as possible anyway. If you have little time to train the women or they don't have enough food to sustain the muscle growth, this could be a problem however. We did once have a girl join who was particularly thin and didn't have much muscle strength and she did very badly for a while, particularly when it came to things like shield walls (this is a particular problem as the weak link in the shield wall is not only in danger themselves but the people near them will also be vulnerable - the whole formation can be collapsed that way). Where women lacked in strength they tended to make up for it in technique - a phenomenon you may also see in certain martial arts. Endurance: when it came to sustained carrying of weapons and wearing armour for a long time or in intense heat, the difference between sexes wasn't very pronounced. Some girls had problems with arming spears (carried in one hand, the other holding a shield) but made up for this by balancing them on their shields or holding them upright when not actively thrusting. Things that aren't covered so much by reenactment: Brute strength - our safety rules generally prevented this but i would say that men would be better at this. This may be where better technique is required by the women to make up for this but many weapons do not necessarily need that much force to do damage. It is also a bad idea to keep exerting yourself to your maximum strength in a long battle as you will quickly tire yourself out. Mentality - we obviously didn't experience the psychological effects of battle. You have to deal with the fact that you kill people (especially the first time) and also with the friends you have lost in battle and the horrific injuries you may have seen. I am unsure how things like PTSD affect men vs women, though the fact that women tend to feel more able to talk about emotion than men may help. Recovery from wounds and illnesses: I am unsure if men and women would differ when it comes to likelihood/speed of recovery from things like dyssentry, wounds and infected wounds. Many women in our reenactment group tended to bruise more easily than men and have torn skin or blisters at the start but this would lessen after a while and they tended to get back into it quickly. Joint injuries like dislocations were probably a little more common in women but this tended to be after previous injuries that were unrelated to the combat. Historically: This isn't related to my experiences but there have been some examples of women fighting in history - though there is some dispute about things like the shield maidens of the vikings. Mostly if women fought they probably disguised themselves as men or did it out of necessity if the camp was attacked so it is hard to know but there are some records out there. Currently only two pirates in later history spring to mind (Anne Bonny and Mary Read) but that's a different period of history and a different style of fighting. It might be worth asking the folks at the history site for more information or when I have more time I can try and provide some sources. 

Our species is hard-wired for a lot of things; but one of them, which seems to be irreducible, is the need to be useful. Take that away from people, and you get all sorts of social pathologies: 

Peter U, I've got to agree with the previous answers: in a high-tech, well-supplied human-colonists-vs-dinosaurs smackdown, it's pretty obviously a one-sided fight. However, you have raised a good dramatic question, and I'm not willing to let it simply die out. :-) There are ways to make a worthwhile story of conflict and survival out of this. Here's one example. (I didn't make this up, really: it's drawn from illustrious predecessors such as Tom Godwin's The Survivors and Marion Zimmer Bradley's account of Darkover's initial population by human starfarers. It also has roots in the Lost World genre of Victorian romance and 20th-century pulps, in which a lost colony of Greeks or Atlanteans or something has persisted in remote parts of Africa or Central Asia...) Rather than having the "colonization" be an orderly, well-funded invasion-style immigration - the kind of thing dinosaurs could not withstand - you could perhaps have some fun with a shipwreck of a starship. This ship could have been one that was intended as a colony ship of sorts, but not fully equipped to regenerate all of the starfaring technology. This would give you a few plot points in which your human-vs-dinosaur conflict could play out: 

The way the question is asked, and the way the overwhelming physical resources of the orwellian systems is framed, it seems that the only true vulnerabilities will reside in 

Constraint #2: Ye cannae change the laws of physics. Also, magic can't change the climate. The After Oil series editor, John Michael Greer, proprietor of The Archdruid Report, put out his call for submissions in contest form. Here's the official statement of the contest rules: 

All right, by the terms stated in Serban's question (which I like a lot), there's no better answer than Michael Kj√∂rling's Peak Oil scenario. Bobson noted, "We can see this coming and we still aren't managing to change it." In other words, it's not just a hypothetical - it's something that we are actually doing to ourselves and to the planet, now. If you look at serious studies of societal and civilizational collapse in history, such as the works of Joseph Tainter and Jared Diamond, it becomes achingly obvious that we're not a different species than the Romans, or the Mayans, or the Easter Islanders, or the Anasazi, or the Achean Greeks, or the Greenland Norse, or... well. Michael has answered the question, as posed, authoritatively. Nonetheless, I'm going to throw another answer out there. I'm going with a pandemic. Not an exotic one - a new strain of SARS, say. Not genetically engineered, not introduced by aliens or military research labs. Just a bad strain of comparatively natural virus. It's not even particularly bad compared to some of the doom plagues already suggested. It kills several million people worldwide, but on a planet of 7 billion that's not much more than a rounding error. Captain Trips it ain't. (I'm not being callous here - the immensity of that number, seven billion, is important to this narrative.) No, the reason our BADASSARS is so destructive is that it mutates pretty quickly, so vaccinations and survivor immunity don't provide much protection. It also has a long latency in the human organism and is exceptionally contagious via many vectors, including the dreaded airborne vector. (It gets through filters pretty readily too.) In short, the only way to stay safe is to stay the hell away from, well, everybody. As a kicker, let's postulate that the terminal symptoms are insanely hideous, like a Krokodil addict with Ebola. The risk of contracting the disease is intolerable, even if intellectually you know your odds of survival are good. In other words, it's pretty carefully crafted to disrupt human contact and society. (I know this because, well, I designed it that way for your reading pleasure.) And here's where that seven billion number comes in. BADASSARS only directly kills several million people, as mentioned. But indirectly it kills hundreds of times times as many. We are seven billion people on a planet that, without modern agricultural technology and transportation/distribution networks, could feed maybe one billion. When the people of the world begin to understand the implications of BADASSARS, the networks unravel. Technological agriculture grinds to a halt. Oilfield workers won't even come to their jobs anymore. Nobody can risk going to stores. Ships won't sail. Soldiers and cops desert. Nobody tends the electrical generating stations (which are running out of fuel anyway.) Why? because people are terrified of each other, because everyone is a monster in each other's eyes. They shoot each other but are afraid to loot the bodies. Civil order is lost. Doomed citizens, in their hundreds of millions, flee the cities, because (to coin a phrase) Hell is other people. After a few years, BADASSARS subsides. It has mutated out of its virulent phase. Still, the world we know - the world of medicine and cars, of electric power distribution networks, of hot clean water for washing up and cold clean water for drinking, of enough food that won't make you sick, of shoes you can afford, of music you don't have to play yourself (and let's face it, you suck at trying to pick out that Richard Thompson song on that guitar you can't tune), of a safe home and a safe community - lies in ruins. It's an unprecedented loss of human life, and the survivors, except for a few sociopaths - oh goody - are likely to be traumatized. Hey, did somebody order a Dark Age?
