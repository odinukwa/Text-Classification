It's a little hard to know how to answer your question, partly because you're using "nucleus" in a confusing fashion. So let me try answering what might be your general question, which is "how do stars move in the region spanned by the bar?" ("Nucleus" is generally used to refer to the inner few hundred parsecs -- or even, these days, just the inner ten parsecs or so. Since bars extend to anywhere from several hundred parsecs to as much as ten thousand parsecs in radius, they are usually well outside the "nucleus". [I am deliberately ignoring so-called "nuclear bars" -- which are generally only a few hundred parsecs in size -- in order to keep things simple ;-)]) Stars in a disk galaxy generally all orbit in the same direction and in the same plane. Some of the orbits are close to circular, while others are more elongated. These elongated orbits precess -- that is, the axis of the apparent ellipse rotates with time, so the star traces out a rosette. In a barred galaxy, there are a lot of stars which are on elongated orbits which are aligned, and which precess at the same rate. Thus, they maintain a common oval region that is dense with stars (the "bar") which rotates as a whole at a more-or-less constant speed (even as the stars making up the bar are doing their own individual orbits at different speeds). The combined gravity of all these stars in an oval configuration is what keeps the whole thing synchronized and consistent, although there are some stars on more chaotic orbits. There is a kind of magic radius called "corotation". This is where an imaginary star in a circular orbit would go once round the center of the galaxy in the same time that the bar as a whole make one complete turn. Stars inside corotation go once around faster than the bar turns, while stars outside this radius would go once round slower than the bar. Stars orbiting inside the corotation radius can form part of the bar (and generally have to be part of the bar if they're not on some very chaotic orbit). Stars outside corotation cannot be part of the bar; their orbits will actually tend to be elongated perpendicular to the bar, though as you get further away from the bar, its gravitational influence becomes less and less important, so that stars further out can have orbits that are pretty much circular. There is good evidence -- both theoretical and observational -- that bars cannot extend further out than the corotation radius, and that bars in fact tend to extend about 3/4 or 4/5 of the way to corotation (with the stars further out but still inside corotation probably having very chaotic orbits). 

As for the second question: we simply don't know the direction or amount of the central supermassive black hole's spin (yet). 

One of the reasons for the difference is the sheer number of different optical (and near-infrared) instruments available. Most professional optical telescopes have two or more standard instruments (e.g., an imager and a spectrograph), with the possibility of adding guest instruments from time to time; some have as many as five standard instruments at the same time. Having the instruments mounted at the base of the telescope makes it much easier to switch between them (sometimes, as with a Nasmyth mount, by simply rotating the tertiary mirror 90 or 180 degrees) than it would be if the instruments were mounted at prime focus. See, for example, the picture at this web page for the SOAR Telescope, which has ports for five different instruments: $URL$ 

I think what you want to concentrate on is the bottom panel in your first figure, which shows the amount of accretion from different sources as a function of redshift (and thus time; see below). This shows that the contribution from "intergalactic transfer" (green cuve = material in winds outflowing from one galaxy that ends up in another) was almost zero until around $z \sim 3$ (age of universe $\sim 2$ Gyr), peaked at around $z \sim 2$ (age of universe $\sim 3.5$ Gyr) and then declined slowly from there, so that it's now about 10% of the peak rate. "$z$" is the redshift, which is being used as a proxy for time: $z = 0$ corresponds to the present day (age of universe = 13.7 Gyr), $z = 1$ corresponds to an age of about 6 Gyr, $z = 2$ is about 3.3 Gyr, and so forth. You can use Ned Wright's Cosmology Calculator to convert individual redshifts to ages of universe (click on the "Flat" button to use a standard cosmology). ("Gyr" = gigayear = 1 billion = $10^{9}$ years, in case that's not clear.) 

As a small addendum to Rob Jeffries' excellent answer, I'll note that you probably can't get a scenario of "H-beta, but no H-alpha" for emission lines, either. The emission lines are the reverse of the absorption lines, so to have H-beta emission without H-alpha, you'd have to have $n = 4$ to $n = 2$ transitions without also having $n = 3$ to $n = 2$ transitions. But even if you could somehow magically arrange to have all your H atoms in the $n = 4$ level, some of them would transition to $n = 3$, and then to $n = 2$, so you really can't avoid H-alpha emission. Furthermore, dust extinction is worse at shorter wavelengths, so dust extinction could in principle give you the appearance of H-alpha emission without H-beta emission, but not the reverse. 

The problem, as far as I can tell, is that the North and South Galactic Poles were defined well before we had any idea of which way the Galaxy rotated. It turned out that the Galaxy's angular momentum vector (in the standard right-hand sense) actually points in the same direction as the previously defined South Galactic Pole. Since there's a separate convention for having "north" point "up", you end up with the backwards rotation definition. William Herschel seems to have started this back in the late 18th Century; I assume his idea was that whichever Galactic pole was in the North Celestial Hemisphere should be called the "northern" pole. (No one back then had any clear sense that the Galaxy necessarily rotated at all.) By the time the actual direction of Galactic rotation was figured out in the 20th Century, the traditional orientation was too well entrenched to be worth upending. 

Clear weather is essential -- you can't observe when it's cloudy! Dry weather is very good, especially for infrared observations (water vapor blocks a lot of infrared light). 

The real key, I suspect, was that observations of "postnovae" -- classical novae after the nova outburst, when the light from the outburst itself no long obscured light from the underlying system -- often showed clear characteristics of binary stars. This took the form of periodic dips in the light curve, suggestive of eclipses, or direct spectroscopic evidence for binary motion, or both. This is discussed, with references (including the Crawford & Kraft 1956 reference that rob mentions in his answer), in Section 2.2 of the 1978 review article by Gallagher & Starrfield in Annual Reviews of Astronomy & Astrophysics. Section 2.4 discusses some of the evidence then available for the primaries being accreting white dwarfs. (If you're not already aware of it, review articles in Ann.Rev.A&A are often a good place to look for answers to questions like this. Sometimes earlier articles are better for certain questions, because they're closer in time to when people were still figuring things out, and so they go over the early evidence in more detail than a later article would.) 

You want to use NED (NASA Extragalactic Database) rather than SIMBAD, since the former has more galaxy- and cluster-specific information. I'm going to assume you have a reasonably accurate position for your galaxy as well as its redshift (in km/s). The basic idea is to identify candidate galaxy clusters which are close enough to your galaxy on the sky and in redshift so that the galaxy could potentially be a member of one of them. 

There's nothing intrinsically wrong with dormant volcanos, as Mauna Kea and the observatories in the Canary Islands demonstrate. Not sure where you would have gotten that idea. 

In the absence of emission lines from ionized gas, the (optical) spectrum of a galaxy will be the sum of the spectra of individual stars. These spectra will have absorption lines for hydrogen (H-alpha, H-beta, H-gamma, H-delta, etc.); the absorption lines are strongest for A stars and weaker for both earlier (O, B) and later (F, G, K, M) stars. If ionized gas is present (as is typical for spiral and irregular galaxies), then there will be hydrogen lines in emission. (This is normally due to O and B stars, which ionize gas with their strong UV emission; you've misread what the Wikipedia article actually says about A stars.) The emission is strongest for H-alpha, weaker for H-beta, and weaker still for the subsequent Balmer lines. This means that emission from H-alpha and (usually) H-beta overwhelms the stellar H-alpha and H-beta absorption, but H-gamma, H-delta, etc. can often still be seen in absorption because the emission from those lines is too weak to "fill in" the absorption lines. Elliptical galaxies usually have only F or G and later stars present; they usually lack both the gas and the UV-emitting O and B stars necessary to ionize the gas, so you see only the stellar absorption lines. The Ca II H and K lines can be seen in emission from individual M stars, due to emission from their chromospheres being strong enough to overwhelm the absorption in the photospheric spectrum (e.g., $URL$
