Let me build on @AlexP's comment, because he's completely right. You can't have liquid water floating above any atmosphere no matter the pressure because LOX is lighter than water. The water would fall and the LOX rise (and then probably boil into a gas). But let's explore the idea in a little different way... Because the idea is super cool. Water vapor gets up there in the form of clouds, which precipitate rain. Might it be possible to have a dense but breathable atmosphere below that permits a very high concentration of water vapor above? And can that water vapor be dense enough to permit, for lack of a better example, fish? For the moment I'm going to completely ignore the fact that fish would fall through water vapor for exactly the same reason AlexP described. I'm also going to ignore what happens to the poor suckers when they happen to swim out the bottom of the pond.... Now, full disclosure, I am not by any stretch of the imagination a meteorologist or climatologist. I am officially pulling this random string of barely related thoughts out of not particularlly dense air. You've been warned.... (And if you're tempted to downvote just because my science is off by miles, remember that I'm having a lot more fun than you are. Thbppttt!) So, you don't tell us who's living on your world, so let's assume some humans have adapted to the climate. According to Wiki the earth is 78% Nitrogen, 20% Oxygen, 1% Argon, 0.04% CO2, some stuff we don't care about, water vapor to between .001% and 5%, and 0.000179% Methane. That's 99.0412% of our atmosphere excluding the stuff I'm not going to worry about and assuming low water content. It's the Nitrogen that's really killing us. That stuff is thin. So we need to reduce it to something like 45%. It's gonna smell and it's going to be honking hot, but we need to vaporize water anyway, right? Let's up the Methane to 2.5%, the Oxygen to 45%, the Argon to 3%, the CO2 just a smidge to 0.05% and up our water vapor to the range of 2.5% - 7.5%. Take those elements I'm not caring about and up them appropriately to fill in the gap. BTW, you need to remember that honking hot comment... OK, we have an atmosphere that would make Venus proud and hey, humans might actually grow accustomed to sucking it in. It'll be a bit too much like living in your 7th grade gym locker room... but we're an adaptable species. Now... here's a guess that will likely send the far more science-oriented among us screaming into the night... right after they found me in a dark alley and beat the crap out of me. But... We need a lot of "light" water vapor. That suggests bonding it to something that will help it float. 

A gravitational singularity is mathematically at the center of a black hole. There are thought to be many black holes in the universe, so to create a singularity that would swallow up the entire universe only requires the most massive black hole and time. A lot of time. As we understand it today, that would only require a black hole with a mass of 40,000,000,001 (yeah, forty-billion-and-one) solar masses â€” and far more time than the age of the Earth will ever be. Can a nuclear bomb do that? No. Heck no. Can one crazy world leader do it? No. Heck no. Unless... Crafting a good story is about helping the reader to suspend their disbelief. You don't need to be right. You need to be believable enough. Therefore, let me introduce you to the Butterfly Effect, a concept within Chaos Theory that poetically suggests a butterfly in Texas can be the cause of a huricane in China. Your problem will be figuring out a way to end the universe quickly. Quickly, as in soon enough to represent a real threat that the old lady next door would care about. Well, maybe not necessarily that soon, but you get my drift. So, let's examine this a moment and see if it takes us anywhere. You don't want an explosion, so a nuclear weapon is useless. Why? Because to create a singularity you need to bring mass together, and explosions do just the opposite (ignoring the tendency for nukes to convert mass to energy, which doesn't help matters). What you need is an implosion. Something that can draw a fearsome amount of mass together to form the largest singularity in the universe. But, if you think about it, an implosion that could do that would destroy the universe just in the attempt to make the singularity that you you've been selling as the universe's coup d'jour. The implosion being much more threatening than the end result (and an embarrasing PR nightmare on top of that)... the end result is a confusing story. OK, so the implosion, which frankly would be a whomping difficult problem to explain in a believable manner in the first place, doesn't leave us with the intended bugaboo anyway. So let's think about subatomic particles. They're all over the place. Let's say you can send waves out with subatomic particles. This might be believable enough that you could postulate for your story the use of subatomic particles to destroy the universe. No, you're not sucking everything into one unbelievably massive black hole. I've proven to myself that that particular plot element is too much to sell. What you're doing instead is setting a blanket that covers the universe on fire. And fires are started with matches. Suddenly, it's possible to come up with the butterfly you need to create your huricane. What might go "boom!" that would create enough disturbance in the sub-atomic ether such that the universe is sterilized? I don't know... but I expect you'll have fun figuring it out! 

Something a bit more immaterial than water vapor is a gas, like our atmosphere. You can walk right through it. Pressurizing a gas turns it into a liquid first, a solid second. 

To build in L.Dutch's answer (which I upvoted, and so should everyone else), this chart tells you the estimated amount of periodic table elements in the earth's crust (just the crust). The biggest problem is that the rarest materials in the crust are, by definition, not required for the survivial of any species. But, let's pretend that they are. Let's also assume that the abundance of the materials holds true throughout the planetary volume. 

A really important ability that wasn't mentioned in the question is that The Thing replicates as it absorbs. Thus, after absorbing a human, what you have left over are two Things. So... about 7.6 billion people on earth, all other things being at least temporarily equal, how many eat-the-human cycles must there be to get all of us? 2n-1 = P Where "P" is the population and "n" is the number of cycles to get there. Since 7.6 billion >>>>>> 1, I'm going to ignore the 1 and say 2n = 7.6 billion or n = 32.83 So, what's a cycle? If everybody is standing in a convenient pyramid shape such that The Thing can go person-to-person in a single second and conversion is instantaneous, then the job's done in 33 seconds. Boom! Instant alien planet. But, the conversion process isn't instantaneous. I don't have a copy of any of the movies to work with, but let's assume this task takes 3 minutes on average. Next, how long does it take to move person-to-person? One would assume that in a city this is much simpler than out in the country. But, let's face it, once people see the absorbtion process begin, they're going to run like Macey's having a 90%-off sale. So...
