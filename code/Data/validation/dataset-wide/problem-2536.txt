now, as for relief from suffering; that's not a philosophy for living we're talking about, that would be opiates and alcohols - and they come with suffering of their own, eventually at least. maybe some unscrupulous huckster sold you a dream wrapped up as buddhism? here's my contention: given an able enough torturer, any buddhist or masochist will be subjected to suffering by the pain they're forced to experience. whether that torturer is a homo sapien, extreme dehydration, some awful disease or whatever else doesn't really matter. a philosophy cannot "end suffering," only help you learn how not to waste your energies railing against that which you cannot change, and how to focus your attention on what is best for you (and perhaps everyone. i believe that which is truly best for you is best for everyone, and vice versa) in the long run. 

I agree with enenalan. i dont remember from what sutta. it was something like, when one wants to be somewhere, The desire to get there is ceased once you have reached your destination. Interestingly, in Buddha's first sermon, one of the causes of suffering (or stress -dhukka) is "craving for non-becoming or vibhava-tanha" . in all pali cannons, Buddha mentioned "craving for non-becoming" only once in his 40+ years of teaching. this, i suspect, is the last cause for suffering one has to abandon to become enlightened. Those who reached this point is called anagami. Please let me know if anyone ever heard " craving for non-becoming or vibhava tanha" mentioned in any other sutta besides the Dhammacakkappavattana. I would greatly appreciate it. 

as for who; "i" is a tricky concept. it's supposed to mean "this continuum of experience given rise by this physical form," or at least that's fairly close to how we tend to think of it. but what it usually, actually means is closer to "the story this continuum of experience tells about itself to itself." "who" is a semi-autobiographical, semi-fictional novel in your head in which the protagonist is of course the author. subjectively, the story is so broad and long and complex that it's very easy to mistake for you-the-continuum, as it does share some similarities. we relate things (including living things) to each other by story, and it's a survival trait, but it'll still bite you in the ass. it's useful when you're making plans to meet someone at a cafe next week, or remember where the best escape route from that tiger is, or do maths. it's less than useful when you're dwelling on how much you miss someone, or how "unfairly" you were treated that time. either you-the-continuum, from instant to instant, perceiving each instant, chooses how you use that story; or you don't choose, so then you perceive through the lens of that story and react according to it rather than reality. 

from my experience, I dont make meditation more difficult than what it has to be.. i would watch my breathing like a curious scientist watches things on his slide via microscope. it is quite pleasant for me 

Factors for Stream Entry. Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: “Sāriputta, this is said: ‘A factor for streamentry, a factor for stream-entry.’ What now, Sāriputta, is a factor for stream-entry?” (1) ‘Association with superior persons, venerable sir, is a factor for stream-entry. (2) Hearing the true Dhamma is a factor for stream-entry. (3) Careful attention is a factor for streamentry. (4) Practice in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor for stream-entry.’ “Good, good, Sāriputta! Association with superior persons, Sāriputta, is a factor for stream-entry. Hearing the true Dhamma is a factor for stream-entry. Careful attention is a factor for stream-entry. Practice in accordance Here is a book free for downloading (no breaking 2nd recept here :-) $URL$ Buddha gave 50+ definitions (40+ in this book) of what stream enterer is and what not. Also how to get there. one thing certain, buddha allowed only him and yourself to predict if you have reached the state. and as for Nirvana, nibbana. it is not a place where 5 skandha is .. vijñāna (consciousness) since it is not permanent (dukkha) ,thus, cannot take root or manifest in Nirvana. the 3rd of 4 noble truths does not describe nirvana but cessation of desires. That is something vijñāna (conscious) can take place. 

It may just be the appearance of harsh speech, and not actually contrary to the path. My understanding of harsh speech may be too gentle compared to what the Buddha intended, and rather the way he engages in what seems to be 'harsh speech' is the norm (or limit) of gentle speech. The Suttas may be fabricated and inauthentic. The Sutta in question may be authentic and the speech may be harsh, yet the Tathagata may be engaging in harsh speech because he knows the limits of all actions and cannot be reckoned by Karma. 

Buddha gave about 50+ definitions (that i know of) of a stream enterer. And also what are not! Pali cannons are very fragmented so this book is for free downloading..with citation to the english translator.. $URL$ One thing clear, Buddha allowed only him and one self to make a determination if you have been into "the stream". above book is very comprehensive. enjoy. 

There are sufferings that parents cannot help. I dont remember from what sutta but it goes something like , parents cannot help a child to be free from sufferings that caused by illness, aging, and death. If your family wants to be free from these universal sufferings, they have to practice dhamma. No other ways around it. Anyone or any being that has name and form (Nama-rupa) experieces sufferings, period. Suffering ends when nama-rupa ends. (those who achieve enlightenment still experience physical pain while they still have the body) nothing you can do to eliminate those sufferings for them. Best you can do is tell them Dhamma taught by Buddha. 

if you're practising buddhism to achieve an end to multiple lives, you're still doing it for the promise of cake - and to be honest, buddhism has a cookie for you right now: clear-mindedness. i'm told that's a tasty cookie, if you can manage to eat it. besides, are you dying this instant? is whatever might happen "next" an actual issue right now? practically speaking, if you're dead you'll have nothing to worry about, so why worry now? and if you do still find yourself worrying, you're clearly not dead in any useful, end-of-your-existence way and have more time than you thought to figure this all out and practice it. so why worry? 

hmmm here is a free book. it has about 40+ sutta of a stream enterer (none-contradict each other whatsoever. We buddhists want to know if we have achieved this level of dharma. Buddha allowed us to proclaim ourselves so and here is the tool. $URL$ I remember a sutta from pali cannon where this rich merchant invited buddha to receive meal at his mansion in a week. later a king or prince desperately wanted buddha to come eat at his place on the same day (i dont recall why). Buddha said he couldnt change the reservation without consent from this merchant because he invited him first. So buddha sent ven Moggallana to this merchant to see what he would think about moving the reservation to a week later. the marchant would agree if ven Moggallana could confirm 4 (or maybe 5) things 1) would he still be alive ? answer was yes. 2) would buddha still be alive? yes. 3) would he still have his wealth? yes. 4) would he still have the unshakable confidence in buddha? ven Moggallana did not answer the last question citing that this was something the merchant had the ability to answer that himself. finally he agreed to move the reservation to a week later. Point is, a confidence in buddha, dharma, sangha is one characteristic of a stream enterer. And Buddha was explicit that only him and yourself can make such a claim. How common is it? Buddha said in one sutta, plenty. not 10, 100, 1000+ as long as 8 fold path is practiced, world is not going to be absent of an arayan (those who is a stream enterer or higher. perfectly good word ruined by Nazi). also compare to another sutta, he compared dust on his finger tips to the entire earth as reference to numbers of Arayans compare to all other beings (seen and unseen) so the ratio would be large! read the book and ask yourself. only you can proclaim yourself .. 

Throughout the Pali Canon you can find instances where the Buddha appears to engage in harsh speech that seems to be contrary to the noble eighfold path. There are several important points/possibilities to understand first: 

Facing a situation where if I report cash income, a lot of people would get in trouble. Would it be a lie to report income as zero when filing taxes? Is abstaining from declaring income on paper a lie? Thank you 

The precept of killing is a great baseline. Very clear: if you kill something with intention, you break the precept. The factors I can remember in the kammic disecction of the matter are: the kammic weight of the one being killed, the intention of killing (and any coupling intents), the actual action, whether or not it succeeds, if, any, regret after the action, and maybe a few more factors. Giving each a realistic weight depending on the full situation will give you an average estimate of how bad it is. The thing is that the actual action is very clear with killing no matter how obscure the situation. With precepts like stealing, lying, or practices like wrong speech there isn't really a meter to hold yourself to. I've asked around on reddit and even here before but I haven't had a proper, well-developed answer to this. Some answers, particularly for right speech focus on following the heart or judging based on emotions, but that is the opposite of a discerning judgment and many of us follow our subtle judgement to worse kamma, not better. A meter of 'that which is not freely given' is pretty good but refuted by the sutta that speaks of 'stealing' a flower's smell. Other answers focus on a middle-ground, but these do not address the right course of action in situations where property becomes non-physical, or ownership of property splits, or other complex situations not faced during the Buddha's time. At the end of the day, there is definitely a right answer to this question, and it's important to know it for this high-speed age. You need to know this before you find yourself in such a situation because the decision has to be made on the spot. The answer exists because to a Buddha's range, there is an absolute understanding of whether an appropriation of property is stealing or not. This absolute knowledge, assuming it is not the result of direct kammic vision, can be practiced by normal people too. Edit: For a precept like stealing, ownership is arbitrary and can't be properly defined. Abusive speech is arbitrary and again changes from person to person. What might be a violation of right speech to one person isn't to another. Lying is pretty objective, but also has its' issues in getting proper communication across. In right speech, abusive speech is subjective: some consider certain words abusive, so if you speak to them in such a manner it won't be right speech. Others might not, and then there should be no violation of right speech in that situation even though everything you do is the same. So how do you find that line of practice where you can say, "I am properly keeping this or that precept, without worrying about self corruption?"
