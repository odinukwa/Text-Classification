Wow, that’s a great question Andy, you really put the community on the spot. You essentially told them to guide you to a place where you want to go and that you believe that they are presently at. IMO, critical thinking is a way of contributing your knowledge on a subject to the greatest extent that your present knowledge, experiences, and beliefs could afford. As for structured arguments (aka debates) I alway try to apply the 5 step of Armis critical thinking to such endeavors. Armis is a high strategy board game that is present played online in over 130 countries. Certified Armis instructors teach critical thinking to students around the world though the Armis For Schools Worldwide program. The 5 steps are as follows: 1) Analysis / Assessment 2) Planning (offensive and defensive strategies and tactics) 3) Risk Assessment 4) The Move 5) The Reaction, Effect, and Experience 1)Analysis and Assessment - before you start any endeavor is important to know the rules that govern it. For Armis you should read the rules, the equivalent for a structured debate it is knowing the rules. Then familiarize yourself with the environment, for Armis that means knowing the game board and player pieces, for the debate it means knowing your own team as well as the opposing team, try to know everyone’s strengths as well as their weaknesses, also get to know the physical environment where you will be debating so that you could take advantage of the audience, acoustics, seating arrangements, and also know as much as you can about the judges the moderator, and any others who may impact your success. Now that you know what you are expected to do and where you are expected to perform the next step is to assess values so that you properly budget your efforts and resources. 2) Planning - In Armis there are over a million ways to properly setup, so after a setup is formed you should map and manage offensive and defensive strategies; for a debate you also need to fashion offensive and defensive strategies, making sure to incorporate an array of tactics (traditional to ‘neauve’ ). Factor in everything that can impact your goal achievement. 3) Risk Assessment - this is where you say "What if?", not just "What if he does?", but also "What if she doesn't?" for the game it is weighing probabilities that a player will do, or not do, certain actions, for the debate it is knowing not just the rules but also the consequences for breaking those rules. At times you may willingly choose to break a rule knowing that it will likely only lead to a minor disciplinary action. Know the risks for being first to answer, weigh the risks of independent thought vs group think, value the possibility of being wrong once, twice, three times. 4) Action - for Armis this is where you make your move, for the debate this is where you make your contribution either to the group, your audience, and or the judges. and 5 Reaction, Effect, and Experience - for Armis it is as much how your opponent’s reacts (or lack of reaction) as much as what effect that specific move has on the rest of the game. For the debate it is also about your opponent’s reactions, but also the reaction of the judges, moderator, and especially the audience. Everything counts, as such the information that make up steps 1 - 5 including your opponent’s move is considered an experience for you to factor into your next move.

You're right. If everyone can create "meaning" based on personal preference not some philosophical idea it will amount to contradiction. Because the concept of purpose on itself (as far as the pure abstract meaning denotes) refers to whatever we pursue in our life. In this sense getting answers can be counted as the purpose of writing questions in Stack, just as making money is for seeking employment, or every other end we seek in our daily decisions no matter how important or intelligent. However when raised in a philosophical discussion, purpose denotes an overarching ultimate end that guides and shapes all of our life decisions towards itself. In this sense purpose doesn't refer to our particular daily life sough-after goals, neither our personal whims and preferences. It will only make sense when rooted in a philosophy that logically argues for some universal truth. Otherwise the term purpose wouldn't bear any philosophical sense and would inevitably reduce to more petty things such as our arbitrary whims that are unqualified for the kind of universal validity that is presumed in a philosophical definition of the term. 

The "fallacy fallacy" is that you reject a conclusion because the argument is a fallacy - even though the conclusion may be right. In general form: 

It's hard to say what you mean by "need". If you mean by it "need to survive", then the answer is obviously no; Homo Sapiens has survived for thousands of years without science. The rest is a matter of opinion; some would say it has improved our lives, some would say it hasn't or has even made our lives worse. I would argue, and again, this is just my opinion - which is all I can give to this kind of question, that science has dramatically improved our lives. Science (see also this article): 

An example of an author who would disagree with me is Jean-Jaques Rousseau. In his Discourse on Science and the Arts (also called the First Discourse), he argues that the arts and sciences are not beneficial to society, but rather add more dependencies and cover up our enslaved state. He was a critic of luxury (which science and the arts make possible), which lead to more inequality, and even argued that it contributed to the corruption of man and moral deterioration. An example of this moral deterioration is that people, who see a scientist, a philosopher, or any other educated man, will try to be like him. In other words, they'll try to be like someone who they are not. They are being dishonest, Rousseau says. The further we push science and the arts, the further we get from who we naturally would be. 

This thesis explains why humans can develop infinite ideas as well as why machines do not since they do not posses mind with which to think and find illumination. Machines can only perform a limited number of seemingly intelligent behavior to the extent of the possibilities afforded by the human design behind it which is always limited. 

I advocate Mulla Sadra's definition of time. A Persian religious scholar of 17th century who was also a genius of the Islamic tradition of Peripatetic, Neo-platonic Philosophy. He introduced innovative theories of epistemology, ontology, theology, and human bodily and intellectual (spiritual) development. In short, Mulla Sadra defines time as an abstraction from instability and motion inherent to the material world, with no actual, independent existence. In other words, concept of time is a result of perception of change or motion in the world. Time has thus no actual existence. What actually exists is motion, and change/motion is an essential property of matter. Obviously concepts of time such as 'past', 'present' and 'future' don't have any actual referent in the external world. These concepts are rooted in our mind, i.e. how we mentally categorize and conceptually preserve the lasting impact of a constantly changing world on our memory. Hence, when we say a day passes, it actually means some realities no longer exist. They are "past" but the memory of that bygone reality enables us to recall it in our mind and categorize it as 'yesterday', 'past', or other adverbs or adjectives of time. One important implication of this theory for philosophy of mind is that it points to the extra-natural essence of human mind. If human mind was not immaterial and thus constantly had its substance changed through time (like material forms), then we could have never have a concept of time, because no perception of reality would be preserved to be recalled later, giving us the sense of time. This in turn reveals that mental entities unlike material entities are in essence static and immutable. Mulla Sadra therefore defines time as the fourth dimension of the material world. The material plane of existence is stretched in 3 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time. Dimensions both suggest gradual, divisive and imperfect existence of the material beings as opposed to the static, inclusive and whole existence of supernatural beings that are never subject to change and thus time. Mulla Sadra's theory of time is a part of his greater theory of Substantial Motion which is the main cornerstone of his theory of human bodily and spiritual development among others. 

The purpose of science, in general, is to gain more knowledge about the world. This, in turn, leads to the possibility of improving our lives. The purpose of natural sciences is to find out more, as the name implies, about the natural world, while the purpose of social sciences is to find out more about social phenomena. I think, if you asked a whole bunch of scientists, they will say their primary purpose is to gain knowledge. If it can improve the quality of our lives, great, if it can't, it's still worth finding out. There is, however, a debate about whether the main goal of science is to improve the quality of our lives or to gain knowledge. In other words, if research on a certain topic will not directly or indirectly lead to an improvement of our lives (medicine, technology,...), should we spend money on it? To give a very concrete example - there are tons of examples; I'm just giving one, take a look at this Numberphile video. Mathematicians found out whether 17 clues is the absolute minimum to solve a sudoku in only one way. This seems fairly pointless -in the sense that it won't improve technology, society,..., and at the end of the video, they immediately try to "give an excuse" by stating that the methods used to solve this problem can be used to solve more important questions. Also, in space missions, they often stress that it can improve our lives in some way if they face criticism regarding the high costs. My opinion on this, and I'm stressing this is just opinion, is that every scientific question is a good one and that even if there is no direct or indirect usage of some new knowledge, it often will someday. 

I think one reality is certain and indisputable: our own individual reality which is intuitively perceived without the need to any empirical data or substantiation. There can be no doubt that you are a self-conscious reality: a reality that realizes itself! Now on the analytical level, the statement "there is no reality" is itself an expression of a reality (the reality of no reality) and therefore a self-defeating statement, nevertheless it proves that we humans have a general sense of 'reality' (that there is something after all that is 'real'). This sense is rooted in our self-conscious being that, as I discussed earlier, is one indisputable supreme reality, if you will. But as for the reality of things that exist out there, we have no way but to employ our natural and artificial means of perception and observation to examine their reality. If our perception or scientific study of an external reality informs us that "there is an apple out there" and there's no other way to prove it otherwise, there seems to be no rational reason in assuming that the observed reality is something else. There's no question that all observed phenomena can be open to scientific reexamination and revision, but in absence of new information about the reality, as I said, there's no reason (as there's simply no evidence and even no practical consideration) to assume the observed reality is something else unless there are new revelations.
