Is there a more secure/better way for setting a user's password non-interactively via a Python script? My current solution uses from a Fabric script. Another option would be to use Pexpect from within the Fabric script. Is my current method of setting the password a security concern? The potential security concern that I see is that the password is shown as clear-text on my local terminal as follows: . Since I only run the Fabric script from my laptop, I don't think this is a security issue, but I'm interested in other people's input. 

Current Configuration The diagram below shows our current network architecture. All connections are running at 100 Mbps full duplex with the exception of the TalkSwitch phone systems which run at 10 Mbs half duplex (upper right-hand corner of diagram). The TalkSwitch boxes each provide 8 analog and 8 IP-based phone connections, so we can have a total of 16 analog and 16 IP-based phones. Note: The four HP ProCurve 2524 managed switches are not configured with separate VLANs. I'm concerned about the performance impact of having both switches, both TalkSwitch boxes, and the wireless bridge connected to our RV082 VPN router in our HQ. 

Post-Upgrade Update On Monday, June 20, 2011, we replaced our Cisco RV082 routers a PC Engines' ALIX SBC running pfSense version 2.0-RC3 (i386). So far, we're very happy with the upgrade. Benefits include: 

I know that by default PostgreSQL listens on port 5432, but what is the command to actually determine PostgreSQL's port? Configuration: Ubuntu 9.10 with PostgreSQL 8.4 

Using the Linksys/Cisco RV082 router, is it necessary to create a Client to Gateway tunnel if all of the remote VPN users will be using Cisco's QuickVPN client, or can you simply configure the QuickVPN clients using the VPN Client Access page and not worry about creating a Client to Gateway tunnel? After looking at the RV082 Manual, the answer doesn't seem clear to me. Thanks. VPNClient $URL$ 

How can I know which edition of SSRS, SSAS and SSIS service is installed on a server? Finding database edition is easy but how to find edition for other SQL services? Any help please? Thanks in advance. 

If the temp db drive is unavailable (others system database files are available), how can I trick SQL server 2000 to create new temp db on C: and start up? When trying to start up using from command prompt, it just displays the following and thats it:

Can anyone tell me what is the Equivalent of SQL 2005's SQLAgentOperatorRole (msdb ) in SQL 2000? I want to grant a login ability to disable a job in SQL 2000. Thanks in advance.... 

For multiple instances of SQL server 2000 servers on the same server, how can I set up to use static ports? I tried to search it on the Internet and i came across This article. If I use this article, how will assign port number for seperate instances? Thanks in advance. 

We have a central management server on which we collect Baselines for remote servers. Baseline includes perfmon counters like logical disk, SQL server buffer manager, physical disk, network interface etc. We save it to a SQL server database. The problem is, it is not collecting data for logical disk for 1 server. To check that there is no problem with counters on this server, I created a server specific baseline to collect only the logical disk counters for this server remotely. It collected counter data just fine. this server specific baseline is running under same credentials as the full baseline. Server specifications: Windows server 2003 R2 standard (64 bit) edition Management Server specifications: Windows server 2003 enterprise edition Any help why it is not working for the full baseline? I have dropped and added the counters manually but it doesn't help. Thanks in advance 

We have two buildings about 200 feet apart connected via SMC's outdoor wireless bridge. Currently, both buildings are on the same subnet with one DHCP server in the main building. This seemed to be the easiest way to setup our network so that clients in either building could have access to the Samba drive in the main building. However, one problem with this configuration is that if the wireless bridge link goes down, then the remote building no longer has a DHCP server. So I'm wondering if it would be better to have the two buildings setup on separate subnets. If I were to convert the two buildings to separate subnets, what configuration changes would I need to make in order for the clients in the remote building be able to have access to the Samba drive in the main building?

According to the IBM Rack Installation Instructions it appears that they use an M6 screw; however, I'm not certain what length. Note: I purchased some M6 x 3/4" screws with clip nuts and nylon washers from Rackmount Solutions (P/N HWM6-50-Clip). I would have preferred to find the combination hex and Phillips screw head that IBM uses by default, but for the price I'll sacrifice having the hex head and go with the Phillips only. Both the screws and clip nuts are functionally interchangeable with the hardware that originally came with the IBM NetBay 42U rack. Another possible option would be the Rack Rail Clip Nuts & Phillips Truss Head Rack Screws from Rack Release Systems. Screw Comparison $URL$ 

What are some reasonable tests to assure ourselves that all the ports on a 24-port hub are working correctly? We have some Linksys EF2H24 ver 2 EtherFastÂ® 10/100 24-port Auto-Sensing Hub that may have had some ports damaged in a lightning strike. I'm wanting to confirm that all ports are operational. Note: I'm taking the hubs out of service to perform the testing, so my main concerns are: 

Execute LogShipping_Destination_Schema & LogShipping_Destination_Logic in master on destinations server Run: exec bts_ConfigureBizTalkLogShipping @nvcDescription = '', @nvcMgmtDatabaseName = '', @nvcMgmtServerName = '', @SourceServerName = null, -- null indicates that this destination server restores all databases @fLinkServers = 1 -- 1 automatically links the server to the management database 

Are there any general rules/tips which we can use to run Sql Server Reporting Services 2005 reports faster? I have been tuning the Tsql behind the reports but does there exist any SSRS specific performance tuning? regards Manjot 

The above process creates linked server with integrated security for authorisation. Work around-change the security on linked server to use service account. 

To find out edition of SSRS, go to: C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\90\Setup Bootstrap\Log on the server which has SSRS Open the Summary.txt file. Look for the log file for Product : Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services. In the SSRS log file, search for keyword "edition"

solved. One of my friends answered: Start the Server Network Utility. To do this, do one of the following: Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft SQL Server, and then click Server Network Utility. In the Instance(s) on this server list, select your instance of SQL Server. In the Default port box, type a static port number, and then click OK. Note The static port that you specify must differ from the dynamic port that your instance of SQL Server is currently listening on. Restart the instance of SQL Server. From: This article
