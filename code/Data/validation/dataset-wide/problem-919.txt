(II.ii.557ff) So the play-within-a-play is designed as a trap for Claudio. Enticed by the prospect of a delightful evening's entertainment (the way a mouse is enticed by cheese), Claudio will find himself caught. When Claudio asks Hamlet what this play is called, Hamlet does not supply its actual name, The Murder of Gonzago: 

No doubt there are others. "Three blind mice" fits with this general partiality toward nursery rhymes, and when that title was hors de combat, "The Mousetrap" was a good substitute. 

Certainly in The Iliad, the love we see that's closest to our current ideals of romantic love is the one between Achilles and Patroclus. So much for the men. What about the women? Very, very little is known about the erotic life of Greek women of the land-holding classes. The women depicted in the sexual couplings abundant on Greek pottery are likely servants or courtesans rather than women of the household. The few fragments we have from Sappho are probably not representative; but one could use those fragments to speculate that with husbands being at best affectionate friends, and other men being taboo, perhaps women too found their erotic fulfillment with each other rather than with men. The Odyssey It's easy to see that Homer's epics share this view of the marital relationship. In the Iliad, the whole point of the Trojan War is to recover a woman stolen from Menelaus. Menelaus does not revile Helen as an adulteress. Rather, he and the other Greeks see her as his property, and Paris as a thief who must be punished. Since Menelaus is brother to Agamemnon, who is the most powerful king in Greece, Agamemnon must help him; and as Agamemnon's vassals, all the other Greeks are drawn into the war too. By stealing Helen, the Trojans have destroyed the very fabric of Greek society, and the only way to restore it is by forcefully retrieving her. We see in the Odyssey that Helen is back at Menelaus's side, still his queen. She isn't discarded as no longer a worthy partner, someone who has betrayed his trust through her elopement with Paris. As the daughter of Zeus and the most beautiful woman on earth, she is still extremely valuable property, and Menelaus still values her. (And let us remember that Helen didn't really choose to run off with Paris. She had no choice; Aphrodite gifted her to him. A woman's erotic preferences are beside the point.) What does this tell us about the relationship between Odysseus and Penelope? Well, for Penelope, as for all Greek women of her class, maintaining her own fidelity is a big deal. It's not that her fidelity marks her exceptional love for Odysseus; it's that it shows how wonderful a wife she is. She runs his household impeccably, not allowing anybody to despoil his property—including herself. One of the main complaints against her suitors is that they are ruining Odysseus's home and fortune by their extravagant demands on her hospitality. That she is able to hold them off with her wit and skill makes her an exceptional woman, well worthy of praise. But to be praised as a good wife in this context is to be recognized for her role as custodian of Odysseus's property: for Odysseus himself, if he's alive; for his son Telemachus, if he's not. And for Odysseus? Of course he sleeps around. It would be odd if he didn't. How strange to believe that he would or should reserve his erotic energies for his wife! Calypso even comments on the double standard: men are expected to play around; if a woman does the same, it needs to be squelched immediately: 

I had always read this as Bastian somehow bringing the Water across the barrier between the two worlds, and thus as the one solid counter to the idea that it all takes place in Bastian's head. However, as pointed out in the comments, Bastian is unaware that his entire journey took place overnight, and thus that his garments are indeed still wet from his previous night's rains. With that said, given that this is a work of reconstructivist art, I don't think the dual interpretations are either unintentional or incompatible. Ende is telling us that this is simultaneously both Real AND in all in Bastian's head, those are not different things within the larger framework Ende is creating. 

During Bastian's return from Fantastica, the following sequence of events takes place (starting on page 388 in my Dutton 1997 edition): 

If I read Dylan correctly, he, a contrarian if ever there was one, is actually arguing that his songs are not "literature" as the term is commonly understood. Of course, this also implies his award is a mistake. Not many people would deliver a Nobel Prize lecture suggesting that their award was an error, but again, this is Bob Dylan we're talking about. Once we let go of the assumption that he clearly must be defending his suitability for the award, the piece reads much more naturally as a defense against his songs being primarily considered as literature (rather than as living works that must be performed to truly be appreciated). 

No. In fact, each poem has a closer relative within the corpus of Keats's work. There's also a stronger connection between "Endymion" and one of Shelley's poems that there is between the former and "Hyperion". Keats first used the Endymion myth in an 1816 poem, "I stood tip-toe upon a little hill". This poem uses the union of Cynthia and Endymion to symbolize the way in which poets, inspired by natural beauty, write poetry that achieves the status of myth. The longer "Endymion", written the following year, enlarges on this theme by giving the beautiful a moral force. The poem begins: 

(III.1) Even as they promulgate antisemitism, both plays also take a critical attitude toward it. The behavior of antisemitic Christians is not treated as justified by virtue of their Christianity or their antagonists' Judaism. Furthermore, Marlowe's own beliefs demonstrate that writing an antisemitic play is no indication of devout Christianity. He is generally supposed to be an atheist. His sometime roommate Richard Baines, a double agent and former Catholic priest, accused him of being so in a celebrated note, written to and at the behest of one of the members of Queen Elizabeth's cabinet. The note says that with regard to atheistic views: 

By "Plato's whimsies" he almost certainly means the idea of the Ideal Forms, or more in general, the metaphysical idea of their being another layer of "Reality" deeper and more real than our own, and from which our own is a forever imperfect copy. These ideas were made explicitly religious by the Neoplatonists, and then incorporated into Christian theology via the work of St Augustine and other early Christian theologians --this work being the "artificial Christianity" Jefferson is also deriding. Jefferson describes Plato's Ideals as foggy and misty. This is because of Plato's claim that we can only grasp them in part here (in the ordinary world), and that any version of them we envision is necessarily incomplete and inaccurate. Jefferson's language probably deliberately echoes St. Paul's famous metaphor of "seeing in a mirror, darkly" as the natural condition of moral, earthly life. Also note that his description of Plato as a "genuine sophist," is a backhanded compliment at best, since Plato consistently portrayed the sophists (who were pre-Socratic philosophers) as superficial wisdom peddlers constantly being bested by Socrates. (This would be like calling Jesus a "genuine Pharisee.") Jefferson is further suggesting that it is only because of (what he would probably view as) the historical accident of a syncretic synthesis of Christian and Platonic ideas that Plato's reputation and philosophies survive at all, despite what he sees as their blatant silliness. His last statement implies that most modern thinkers wouldn't give such obsolete ideas even the ghost of a thought, but that it is enjoyable to talk them over, even dismissively, with someone else educated in the ancient Classics and Christian theology. (It is, however, worth noting that we still study Plato, even two more centuries past the time of Jefferson. Furthermore his "whimsies" were already 300 years old at the time of Christ --and twice that by the time Augustine learned them.) 

Marital love in Greek society was not thought of as an enduring romantic and emotional bond between two equals, with sexual fidelity a marker of their trust in and satisfaction with each other. The Ancient History Encyclopedia says: 

"Let him die" and "let him go" refer to the year, of course; but they equally refer to Hallam. Tennyson is explicitly letting go of the grief of Hallam's death. This is not to say that he has gotten over it. Rather, as the next few poems show, he is determined to honor Hallam's qualities and remember him with joy rather than sorrow. Structurally, then, the three Christmas celebrations are important milestones in the overall journey of In Memoriam from despair to acceptance, even to joy. The Prologue asks for "a beam in darkness: let it grow"; the Epilogue is an epithalamium for the poet's sister, who was engaged to Hallam at the time of his death, but is now the bride of another. As the joyful Epilogue shows, the poem as a whole shows that the prayer in the Prologue is answered: 

Searching for a work of metafiction I read about 5 years ago, probably published originally in the early 2000s. It's a bizarre fable about a young man who develops an obsession with a girl, a stranger to him, who is in a coma. I seem to think there may have been a motorcycle involved. He tells her a series of increasingly lurid and dreamlike fairy tales about him and her, where each story is nested inside the last, like the Arabian Nights. If I recall correctly, the characters are named only with letters, and even the "base level" of reality has a strongly allegorical feel, implying that each of alternate fantasy versions of the story is as valid as the original. It seems like Kafka and/or Nabakov may have been an influence. I believe the narrator has a mundane job of some sort, like accountant, and is apprenticed to his uncle. I didn't find it entirely successful as a book --partly because it never felt grounded in any stable reality --but it was memorable, at least in its conceit, if not by title and author. 

Similarly, the second half of Sodom and Gomorrah (volume 4), and the entirety of The Prisoner and The Fugitive (volumes 5 and 6), constitute what is called "the Albertine cycle". Aaron Matz says of this cycle: 

So the sort of ritual we expect around romantic love—a man chasing a reluctant love object, wooing that object with poetry and gifts, eventually overcoming that reluctance—was associated in ancient Greece with homosexuality, not with one's eventual marital partner. Coontz says that the Greeks even considered this sort of homosexual love the noblest of all: 

As long as Endymion pines after the ideal beauty of the moon, it is out of his grasp. But when he falls in love with a mortal woman, she turns out to be Cynthia after all. By enjoying her earthly beauty, Endymion ultimately finds union with his divine beloved after all. The connection with the earlier poem is readily seen, in that the celebration of beauty is granted mythic force as a path to union with the divine. "Hyperion" is rather darker. Focusing as it does on the Titans after their defeat by the Olympians, it immediately undercuts any sense that to be divine (or to be united with the divine) guarantees that no harm can befall one. Paradoxically, Apollo the Olympian (and the divine poet) becomes a god precisely because he undergoes great suffering and thereby has an insight into human tragedy—something the Titans lack. Keats abandoned this poem, however, around April 1819; perhaps the fact that the Titans are suffering as well made the contrast between Olympians and Titans hard to sustain. He took up the theme again later that year, in "The Fall of Hyperion". Here too Keats focuses on suffering and the role of the poet. On the one hand, poetry can present false, unreachable ideals to humankind and thus increase its suffering; on the other, poetry can provide a visionary insight into the nature of human suffering and thereby foster compassionate acceptance. Keats ended up abandoning this poem too. It seems that as his views on what poetry should be grew more complex, they resisted explicit expression in any final, resolved form. The shorter "Ode on a Grecian Urn" captures the tensions all the better for leaving them unresolved: the urn, as a beautiful object, is outside human suffering; yet the figures on the urn are also devoid of fulfillment. It's true, then, that "Endymion" and "Hyperion" share the same mythic universe; Endymion's beloved, Semele (whom Keats calls Cynthia), was in fact Hyperion's daughter. It's also true that thematically, they share concerns: like so much of Keats's work, they are about the nature of poetry and the role of the poet. Yet they are vastly different. The conception of poetry in the later work is darker and less straightforwardly idealistic. There is no evidence that "Hyperion" was intended as a continuation of the earlier work. If anything, the fact that it is in blank verse, as opposed to the heroic couplets of "Endymion", suggests that Keats did not mean to connect the two. Finally, critics have noted that "Endymion" was influenced by Shelley's 1815 poem "Alastor", and probably intended as a response. "Alastor" tells the story of a poet who, like Endymion, pines after an unattainable lady. Unlike Endymion's, though, Alastor's quest is unsuccessful, largely because he lacks human sympathy. There is an argument to be made that insofar as "The Fall of Hyperion" also take up the theme of poets and human sympathy, it represents a later and more considered meditation on the problems raised Shelley's work. Certainly the two poems have been compared, rather to Shelley's detriment. As far as I know, however, nobody has raised the possibility that Keats was thinking of "Alastor" not just while writing "Endymion", but also some three years later while working on the "Hyperion" poems. If that speculation has merit, then there is another connection between "Endymion" and "Hyperion". Still, they would be connected via Shelley rather than directly with each other. 

It seems likely that Adams was just taking an opportunity to get one more adolescent dig in at an old friend and rival, who thus got to be immortalized as the "worst poet in the universe." Sources claim that Adams was a regular contributor to Johnstone's high school English zine, and that the two of them jointly received a prize in English while attending the Brentwood School in Essex. The poem attributed to him in the book as an example of his wretchedness was actually written by him (I'm guessing as another high school joke). An old schoolmate of both of them remembers Johnstone as "unbearably pompous for a 19-year old" but Adams as only slightly less so. His name was disguised in the print editions of The Hitchhiker's Guide as "Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings," after he complained, apparently not because of being called the "worst poet" but because his complete actual home address was included in the original broadcast (which seems like a reasonable concern). So in other words, Adams was both trolling Johnstone and doxing him, doubtlessly for his own personal amusement. Would any one among us do less for an old high-school friend?
