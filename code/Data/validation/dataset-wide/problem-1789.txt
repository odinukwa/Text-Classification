This has an added value, since you will not loose the current user session and hence when you unlock the workstations you are going to be able to see if he was trying to do something nasty before being escorted to the door. All credits to Command Line Kung Fu Blog. There's a bunch of crazy security/forensics related things in there! UPDATE: The first two steps are intended for local users, in an active directory environment is actually easier, disable the account and change the password in AD, and then run the 3rd command against the malicious user IP address. 

In Sonicwall firewalls, regardless of whether you have multiple internet providers or just one, you have to set at least one interface in the default LB group in , as shown in this screenshot: 

Sonicwall can also block traffic based on App Control rules (assuming that you have this feature licensed), you can disable this temporarily to ensure that this isn't affecting HTTPS traffic: Disabling Application Control on LAN zone: 

DNS is not responsible for that and does not have that capability. Some kind of URL rewriting mechanism in the web server is the one doing the redirect from HTTP to HTTPS by issuing a 301 redirect response to the original request. 

Yes, you can use your existing AD infraestructure. The exchange installation is going to require an additional step in the DC: Launch an elevated command prompt and run the following command: D:\setup /PrepareAD (asuming that you have the Exchange installation CD in D:) 

You can either wait a couple of hours until the new rule takes effect, or force it restarting the Transport Service. 

The User Guide of the HP DL380 Gen8 goes into a little more detail in the extra-fan-issue and suggest that installing the additional fan without a second processor is not going to work: For a single-processor configuration, four fans and two blanks are required in specific fan bays for redundancy. A fan failure or missing fan causes a loss of redundancy. A second fan failure or missing fan causes an orderly shutdown of the server. Installing more than the required number of fans in a single-processor configuration is not a supported configuration. For a dual-processor configuration, six fans are required for redundancy. A fan failure or missing fan causes a loss of redundancy. A second fan failure or missing fan causes an orderly shutdown of the server. 

Weird, that rule should be enough to make it work, the required routes are automatically created in the Sonicwall for trusted interfaces. Is the option enabled in the WLAN Zone? Try starting from the step 2 on this document. Sonicwall UTM - Wireless: How to allow TCP communications between Wireless (Authenticated to SonicPoints) and Wired Hosts connected to the same network without using Layer2 bridge Mode. 

You will need to forwards UDP ports 500 and 4500 to the TZ300, since Sonicwall uses IPSEC for GVC clients. You should not need another firewall or NAT rule to allow GVC clients to the LAN, however, your users will need to have the propers Subnets/Address Objects in the VPN Access tab of the User/Group properties. 

You can use the real time monitor and filter to match your desired interface to view how much bandwidth is using that interface, and which applications are using that bandwidth. 

According to SonicWALL's Log Event Reference Guide, the UTM only logs up to 32k and then flush the logs. 

Always check the SELinux context of the files that are accessible with , then use with the option to copy the context to other files. 

You can accomplish this with a router/firewall with a feature called Policy Based Routing. With this you could make a rule like: When traffic is coming from my mail server AND the destination port is 25, send the traffic through this ISP. 

Try increasing the uploadReadAheadSize in IIS as in the following example (change the size to the one that you need): 

Don't know exactly why it's not being redirected, however, you can try to block all empty user agents with this rule: 

For Windows, The most straightforward option out there (from the ones that I tested) is a commercial solution called RdpGuard. There's also one solution called IPBan, although I never tried that one. You can also secure RDP requiring client certificates, check this article. More interesting articles about securing RDP against brute force attacks: Automatically block RDP attacks on your Windows Server 2008 Automatically banning IPs with Windows Firewall after scanning the eventlog 

There are various options like NaCl, fireSSH and as you already mentioned Shell In A Box. I'd personally recommend the last one if you need it for pentesting purposes, since it's the only one that actually uses SSL/TLS and would not trigger an alert in any IPS/Deep Packet Inspection device. (Most of these tools will trigger an alert since they are just browser based SSH or non SSL traffic through port 443) 

Assuming that both webservers are in the same network (not distributed across sites/countries), the best solution will be to put a Load Balancer device in front of the web servers, one of the best ones out there is F5 LTM, but as this is an expensive appliance, I would recommend haproxy, which is an open source software package compatible with most *nix based systems. Some useful resources for your particular scenario: Zero-Downtime Restarts with HAProxy Easy web server Load-Balancing with HAProxy Creating a maintenance page for your site So, you can put a Linux server with haproxy in front of those servers to load balance the incoming requests. 

By default, Postfix only listens in the localhost interface. You must edit and change the line to and restart Postfix 

Although not supported, you can try to either remove the IP address of the new server from in the Synology NAS (if is there for some reason, like a fail2ban rule) or add it to 

However, as you stated, it will only secure your RDP connections. I guess a VPN is an obvious solution, but since you didn't mention it I assume that is not what you are looking for. You can reduce the attack surface with one or more of these:
