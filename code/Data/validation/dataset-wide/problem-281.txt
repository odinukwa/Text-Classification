Water currents - eh. Air currents, absolutely. Manipulating air temperature also manipulates air pressure: aka wind. A constant warmer + lower pressure zone of air would keep the sails full. 

For the purpose of your story, make it whatever you like. Perhaps aliens abducted all the people on cape cod and used them to start a colony - now that colony is 25% gay. 

Yes. Rather than use a hoop, you can use a second train. Every time they pass each other in orbit, they push off each other, creating a more elongated orbit. You wouldn't go straight from Earth to another system, though. You'd build up velocity around the earth to travel to the sun, then you would repeat the process using the sun's vastly superior gravity, as well as a convenient fusion reactor - allowing you to build up a much, much higher velocity. You aim both ships towards your target system, and they set out together. When they get to the target system, they use its sun to slow down again; orbiting around it and using each other to break. Then make the final trip to the destination planet when they are going slowly enough to be captured in orbit. And that's how you get across space without any propellant. Plz send my nobel prize in the mail. The length of the trains wouldn't matter - your maximum speed is governed by the escape velocities of the 4 orbiting bodies - Earth, Sol, target sun & target planet, although a longer one would need fewer orbits to accelerate without pasting the monkeys. There would also be a lot of planets that would be mathematically impossible to get to. 

I'm designing an esoteric symbol to use in a story. I have zero experience with this but can use drawing/CAD softwares. Where can I find some resources on how to design a symbol? I guess a good list of existing ones with references to meanings, associated concepts and cultures would also help. I'm talking about a symbol specifically, not a logo or trademark etc. 

They are relatively rare in fiction but there are a few interesting examples, in fact I even remember reading about one in real life. I would like mine to be small and light (say less than 0.9 kg and less than 2 cm in diameter). Death must be assured if the conditions are not met. So, can we build it with current tech? EXTRA POINTS: it would be great if there was room for extra stuffs, say a microphone, GPS or other things... Recharge is also an issue, can they last indefinitely if powered by body motion like clocks? 

I would say almost any animal. smaller animals are "less susceptible" to gravity changes since being smaller they have a lower volume/surface ratio, so with a 0.72 g they would barely notice. water dwelling animals would also barely notice since they live inside water where buoyancy almost negate their weight. bigger animals would indeed notice and with time they would be subject to some changes. However an adult elephant that weights 7000 Kg on Earth would be about 5000 Kg on Terra; not a very big difference. They are going to be ok. 

Imagine the universe as Einstein's trampoline, with each universe being its own trampoline. Go to a point on your trampoline where it's just like the trampoline of your target destination - probably (but not always) a really long way from a gravity well, where both trampolines are almost flat. If there were two identical solar systems, you might be able to do it in a gravity well. Blast off a shitload of energy. Like, infinite heat levels of energy, where the rules of physics start to get really weird. You can punch a hole through your trampoline and their trampoline. You can even cauterizing the edges to keep it open. Now you can travel between universes. 

I always think of them as isotopes with such a large difference in neutrons that they have different chemical properties. The fact that these things aren't conceivable under our current understanding of physics is kind of the point. We have no idea how it got there and no idea how to make it. That's why it's rare, and that's why we have to go to that planet to get it. Maybe it was left over from the previous big bang, or from another universe entirely. Maybe Q put it there just to f*ck with us. So much of the universe's mass is unaccounted for. There's only protons, neutrons and electrons around this neighborhood, but who knows what's really out there? 

This person is kinda of a show-off. He wants to build a nuclear weapon simply to impress everyone because he's a smartass. He means no harm, fissile and explosive components are replaced with inert materials so the contraption is completely safe. He just wants to show that he can do it. Can he do it? In the sense "Is it legal for someone to build a safe but possibly functioning atomic device in their backyard? What could be the consequences?" I expect him to receive some phone calls at the very least. (Asking for a friend of a friend) 

Is there a reliable and, at least, relatively safe way to keep a person unconscious for a period of at least a year(more would be better)? It doesn't really matter whether the individual is comatose or just "sleeping". I just need a way to keep a person unconscious for a year or more without causing any substantial physical damage to them. I'm not an expert so I don't know if using anesthetics for a long time is dangerous or how to avoid other issues like bedsore and stuff. 

These settlers live on a planet, which surface temperature and pressure are compatible with human life. However humans cannot breath its atmosphere. The gas in the atmosphere is not necessarily toxic or extremely dangerous (skin exposure is ok), but it will eventually kill a person (or maybe the atmosphere simply lacks oxygen). So my people will need a "mask" to wander around. I want it to be as small and simple as possible, and would prefer if it leaves the mouth "free". I was actually thinking of some kind of nose respirator, but I guess it would make their voice funny. How can I deliver breathable air to people with the minimum amount of hardware around their face?
