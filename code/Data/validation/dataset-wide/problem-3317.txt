It's the result of lowering of /u/ before the consonants /h~x/, /hʷ~xʷ~ʍ/ and /r/. According to Winfred P. Lehmann in Gothic and the Reconstruction of Proto-Germanic, short /o/ and /u/ (and short /e/ and /i/) were nearly in complementary distribution in Gothic, but further sound changes that occured after the process of lowering created some exceptions to this general pattern, such as aíþþau "or" and hiri "here". 

Are these last two related to the prothetic s- seen in Latin sub, super? (Wiktionary gives super < *eks-uper, but ὑπέρ < *uperi, which would seem to suggest that it is just a coincidence). A related question: a rough breathing seems to also have developed in some words that didn't start with upsilon, but that had *w in their PIE form. In most words starting with *w in PIE, like *wérǵom > ἔργον (érgon) the *w simply developed to ϝ (representing the sound /w/) and was later lost, leaving a smooth breathing behind. Why did a rough breathing develop in the following words? 

I would guess it's just an areal feature within the Indic languages, but I don't know very well. Dravidic languages generally don't distinguish between aspirated and unaspirated series of consonants in their native vocabulary (although they may in vocabulary taken from Indic languages), so it seems unlikely to me to have arisen from Dravidic influence. 

It is a coincidence. The prefix "yotta-" is in no way Greek. It is a modern, invented, coinage, derived from Greek ὀκτώ (okto) by a very roundabout and idiosyncratic route. Armenian յոթ (yot') derives from Old Armenian եօթն (eot'n), older եւթն (ewtʿn), ultimately from IndoEuropean *septḿ̥ See Wiktionary here and here 

The answer is that we do not know (and possibly never will). There are a number of theories, such as Eurasiatic mentioned in Anixx's answer, and Nostratic (I wasn't aware that there was a theory that includes both of these), but none of them is widely accepted by linguists. 

It is possible, but I'm not aware of any evidence for it. As Mohammd Sanei points out, the root שבת (šbt) means "rest", which is a more obvious origin. On the other hand, שבע (šv') as well as 'seven' also underlies שבועה (švu'h), which means 'oath'; so a single root can have unrelated meanings. 

I don't think we ever know for sure how a sound change happens. We can deduce what changes have happened (and sometimes experience what changes are happening), and we can certainly conjecture about the phonetic processes involved, but we can never really answer how (or why) questions. Here, the obvious conjecture is that in that context, the fricative /s/ came to be replaced by a different fricative /f/. In other places the sequence became /ʃr/ or /str/, suggesting that it is often found to be awkward. I also notice that when I pronounce /sr/ I have a tendency to project my lower lip. If I happen to protrude my upper lip a bit, it can become /sfr/ (actually /sφr/, with a bilabial fricative). Notice that the other examples you give are difficult to understand unless you assume that they went through a fricative stage such as /β/, /ð/ or /ɣ/; then the probable process would again be substitution of the different fricative /f/. You can see a similar process at work currently in dialects of English where /θ/ (as in think) appears as /f/. 

I have a two-part question about the pronunciation of hygiene in English. The usual pronunciation, as shown by a variety of online dictionaries accessible from OneLook Dictionary Search, is /ˈhaɪdʒiːn/ (Merriam-Webster also lists /haɪˈdʒiːn/). This is interesting because I know of no other English word of Greek origin where ie represents /iː/ (setting aside plurals ending in -ies for people with happy-tensing). But what really surprised me was finding that the Oxford English Dictionary lists another, more regular-looking pronunciation where the ie represents two vowels in hiatus: /ˈhɪdʒɪiːn/. (You'll need a subscription, either personal or through an institution like a library, to access the preceding link.) After some searching, I found another source that lists a similar pronunciation, with the "ie" in hiatus but the "y" apparently long (/ˈhaɪdʒɪiːn/): The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language, by John Ogilvie, 1883. (Unfortunately, due to the low quality of the Google Books scan, I'm not entirely sure if the first "I" in the transcription has a macron (which would indicate the pronunciation /ˈhaɪdʒɪiːn/) or just a tittle (which would indicate /ˈhɪdʒɪiːn/, the same as the OED). Question A: does anyone know of any other sources that describe the pronunciation with a hiatus? I've never heard anybody use it and I wasn't able to find it listed in any other dictionaries, past or present. The earliest dictionary I found that lists the pronunciation of this word is from 1874, A Dictionary of Medical Science by Robley Dunglison (p 519), and it seems to just give the usual modern pronunciation: 

No. Your rule mostly works, but "in a row" fails to capture constructions like "He has definitely gone", where has is still an auxiliary. In fact, trying to analyse syntax just by considering the surface sequence is usually doomed to failure. Consider 

As far as I am aware, it is not a concept that has been discussed enough to have a customary term. If I were writing about it, I would use word form. 

I've never heard this, and don't know which accents it pertains to. But it appears to me to be a perfectly normal example of epenthesis (in fact it is mentioned in that article) I think /k/ in "espresso" is different: that is because of the influence of English words like "express". /aks/ is an example of metathesis, which is a different process. 

I don't think speakers do determine this, or need to. A word has (usually) a number of meanings, and we learn these in context (and sometimes a new meaning appears). It is only lexicographers and other analysts who have any need to identify which of the meanings are literal or basic and which are not. 

It is Amharic, and the picture is upside down. The items below (at the top of your picture, between horizontal bars) are numerals. 

Maybe one of the options is not "grammatical", only "acceptable" One solution is to say that the "naive" opinion of native English speakers is wrong, and one of the two options is ungrammatical after all. When you ask a speaker to judge a sentence, you're really getting an acceptability judgement, not a grammaticality judgment in the technical sense of "grammaticality". And there are reasons to suspect a sentence may be judged acceptable even if it is not "grammatical" from a theoretical perspective. Norbert Hornstein has made various posts about this on the generative-grammar blog "Faculty of Language"; e.g Acceptability and Grammaticality, Degrees of grammaticality?, Judgments and grammars This might seem like a reversion to the pre-scientific viewpoint of the prescriptivists, but there are various reasons to suppose that speakers sometimes systematically produce and accept constructions that are not "grammatical" in a generative-grammar sense. E.g. do we really expect a synchronic grammar of English to account for the remnant uses of the subjunctive in sentences like "God save the queen"? Preminger (2017) seems to take this viewpoint about the case of coordinated noun phrases in English: he says sentences like "My mother and I went to the market" aren't actually grammatical. 

The usual term for this is "syncretism". My understanding is that there is a fair amount of debate about the best way to analyze cases like these, although I don't know how much of this is about splitting hairs. For example, I recently ran across the following abstract (unfortunately, I haven't gotten to read the paper yet): 

The existing of similar-sounding words in different languages tells you approximately nothing about any possible connection between the words. Unless you can show that they are part of a wider, regular, sound correspondence between the languages, or that there is a plausible route by which one might have been borrowed, there is no reason to believe that anything other than coincidence is involved. 

The verb they tabulate to illustrate is גלה 'reveal', which displays exactly the same patterns as you mention with תלה. They go on to say that 

There is no reasonable analysis under which "mcDon" is a syllable. It is two syllables, irrespective of whether you write an 'a' in it or not. "Kvit" (or "kvi") is one syllable except for those people who find it impossible to pronounce the cluster "kv", and for them it is two syllables. 

There are some examples in different languages in Rebracketing in Wikipedia. Incidentally, this has absolutely nothing to do with "letters". It happened, in probably every case, in the spoken language, and quite likely among people who were illiterate. 

You are using related in two different senses. When linguists refer to languages being related, they almost always mean "genetically related" - stemming ultimately from the same linguistic source. Most linguists today do not regard Hebrew and Greek as genetically related, but there is a respectable minority who believe that we can trace relationship further back than Afro-Asiatic and Indo-European to a superphylum, such as Nostratic, or Eurasiatic, depending on the particular theory. In those linguists' conception, Hebrew and Greek are related, but very distantly, in the way that a horse and a fly are very distantly related. Whatever kind of relationship the Jewish tradition talks about it is nothing like the linguistic conception of genetic relationship. It sounds from your account that it is something to do with suitability for use in particular contexts. Such a concept is purely a product of thinking about languages and not about their innate or historical properties, whereas the idea genetic relationship is predicated on there being an objective historical relationship, that of common descent. 

Is this related to the *s that comes later in each of these roots? I don't know if it's also relevant that the PIE word-initial cluster *wr- merged with the reflex of the cluster *sr- in Greek, giving ῥ (rh, rho with a rough breathing). 

This paragraph seems to suppose that in all languages that display the phenomenon of "ergativity", the concepts of "subject" and "object" are artifacts of applying an analysis based on non-ergative languages. This really isn't the case, though: many languages have ergative morphology and also other aspects of grammar that make it possible to demonstrate in a rigorous fashion that absolutive-marked NPs in intransitive sentences and ergative-marked NPs in transitive sentences behave alike in cetain contexts or in certain respects. That is, there are motivations for distinguishing the concept of "absolutive-marked noun phrase" from the concept of something we can call the "subject" that arise from the structure of these languages, not just from the imposition of external concepts of subject- and object-hood taken from languages without ergative morphology. Sure, we could call this concept something other than "subject" if we wanted to, but "subject" seems to fit the semantics and has mnemonic value, so why use a different word? In many (but not all) languages with an "ergative" system of case-marking, the noun phrase that is morphologically marked as ergative case in a transitive clause acts syntactically similar in a number of ways to the noun phrase marked as absolutive case in an intransitive clause. This phenomenon is often called "split ergativity". So within many particular languages that makes use of ergative marking, we can have quite clear evidence of a concept of "subject" in those languages from other patterns of marking in other contexts (e.g. the difference in case marking in the past/perfect and present tenses in Hindi and Urdu), or from syntactic evidence e.g. the behavior of "pivots". 

The process is described briefly under Vocal folds in Wikipedia. The air pressure forces the vocal fold out of the way, but then the fold springs back under its own elasticity, interrupting the air again. When that happens repeatedly, it forms an oscillation, which is audible. 

Both have the same surface structure, but most analyses would consider am an auxiliary, but went not one: walking is a complement of the full verb went. 

"How to prove" something that probably isn't true, is rather difficult. According to this site, the Thai word has a solid etymology pla.A in proto-Tai-Kadai. If this is true (and I have no idea how reliable the site is, but it looks plausible) then the word is not a loanword from Sanskrit, and has no connection with the PIE root (unless you subscribe to one of the controversial super-grouping theories). 

There are instances where a word has been altered by folk-etymology, or by analogy with another word. For example, the English word admiral is ultimately a borrowing from Arabic amir al-bahr, but the 'd' is thought to have appeared by confusion with admirable. In that particular case one could say that the word has two sources. But such examples are the exception, not the rule. 

This is a list of Arabic corpora, with notes about their origins. While I doubt if any of them specifically exclude Quranic quotations, many of them will be predominantly non-Quranic. 

I found a paper from 2002 ("j-pinyin: A New Systematic Approach to the Japanese Transcription of Chinese Syllables," by Jin-Hua SHE, Shumei CHEN, Sumio OHNO and Hiroyuki KAMEDA) that says that at that time, there was no general standard for transcribing modern Chinese into Japanese; it proposes the titular system which you can see described in the paper. I don't know if it's caught on at all. It doesn't look like it transcribes tone. Diphthongs are just transcribed by using multiple kana. Apparently, in j-pinyin the difference between the coda consonants "n" and "ng" is represented by using a long vowel mark (ー) before the second. 

I'm making this post pretty much just to link to something that seems relevant. I don't really understand the definition of recursion or its relevance to language. This may be a bit dangerous, but hopefully someone will tell me in the comments if I've mis-summarized something or if none of what I've linked to is worth anything. The answers and comments to What's the difference between recursion and embedding? indicate that the defintion of "recursion" may vary between different theoretical frameworks. "On recursion", by Jeffrey Watumull, Marc D. Hauser, Ian G. Roberts and Norbert Hornstein (Front. Psychol., 08 January 2014) is a review article that seems to lay out a generativist perspective on the linguistic definition of "recursion":
