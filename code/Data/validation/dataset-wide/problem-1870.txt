If they ask these questions, they must ask both of all candidates. Once a candidate has been hired, but before they start work, more specifics are discussed as the employer is required to actually verify the candidate's authorization to work. In practice, it is somewhat commonplace to discuss some of the details during the interview process, especially if they are volunteered by the candidate. In your case, you can't give a 100% guarantee that you won't need sponsorship until you get your green card. So, I would recommend stating during the interview process that you are authorized to work in the US and that you do not anticipate needing sponsorship in the future. If you feel this leaves things too unclear, then you might give some detail about your adjustment of status being in progress. 

One option would be to ask them how they will go about making the decision on who to hire. It doesn't directly ask about other candidates, but they might discuss the need to review other candidates or close out internal applicants, etc. 

You need to make the problem visible to your management. If you are able to, try to prepare answers to the following questions: 

Take this information to your management or work with your management to define answers to these questions. Based on this, and whatever financial constraints there are on the project, it should be possible to make the decision to hire or not. 

Forwarding Forwarding the relevant emails, as you mentioned, is another solution. The only major difference between a BCC and a forward (aside from icons in your mailbox client and the like) is that a BCC is the exact email that you sent, whereas a forward allows you to edit the forwarded message before sending to the other party. Again, this may be a benefit or a drawback, depending on your needs. Talk to the Manager As with most things involving human behavior, there is also a non-technical solution which may get you better results: ask your manager how you should keep the other relevant parties informed. As you mentioned, your manager is looking at external reasons that you are unaware of. It may be office politics or there might be some sort of larger email policy at play. Talk to your manager about what you are trying to accomplish and why and the two of you should be able to reach a mutual solution. You can always print/make local copies of the emails (or your manager's response to those emails) if you need proof that you told your manager about X. 

The employment contract, as there is usually a section about "proper use of company electronic resources" or something like that which mentions what you can and cannot do on the network. The IT staff, as they are usually the ones who configure and maintain such software. However, they may not be allowed to tell you the specifics of how you are being monitored, depending on the company's policies. HR, as they are usually the ones to determine how the company's policies should be enforced. 

Depending on where you are applying, I would not worry about your last name too much. Many (most?) people from countries where Slavic names are not common do not understand what the 'ova' suffix means. In the US, for example, there are quite a few women of Polish descent with last names ending in 'ski' rather than 'ska' and most are probably unaware that the ending is 'incorrect'. Given that the requirement to make names gender neutral is restricted to hiding first names, I think it is safe to assume that whoever posted the ad is unfamiliar with Slavic last names and the fact that they can reveal the person's gender. 

In a similar situation, I was kicked out of an interview after I could mention what the other companies I was interested did but could temporarily not recall what the interviewer's company did. Companies in this situation expect you to do some minimal initial homework and have a partially formed idea about why you might want to work there. Even if you are a stellar candidate and it is a candidate's job market, you run the risk of being passed over without this. Without it, the interviewer will be wondering what will keep you interested in working there after you are hired. 

The key message is: you should not be the team police officer. Instead, you should introduce them to some good practices, potentially through Lunch and Learn sessions or similar, and then see if you can get them to agree together to try some out. You will likely need management buy in for some of these. Most of the bad practices you want to avoid are covered in teams I work with by automated checking or self-selected, self-enforced group policies. For example, we have automated tools in the build that do static code analysis and report warnings when things are not properly checked. We collectively agree on enforcing a zero warning policy and the builds are monitored (by the team) to ensure compliance. Code reviews are instituted as standard practice: every change set is reviewed by another developer. In this way, no one is singled out for closer scrutiny. 

With that said, it may be legal in your area for the employer to monitor you without telling you ahead of time, so there may be no way to know. You probably want to consult a lawyer in your area to see if that is the case. How should adjust my behavior? You should be safe if you always follow your company's guidelines. If your company allows you to use their computers for personal business during lunch or after your work is done, then feel free to do so. If your company says that work computers are only for work-related activities and cannot be used for any non-work stuff, then follow that and do your personal activities on your personal computer at home. If you are not sure what your company's policy is or if your planned usage meets that policy, ask your supervisor or ask HR. If there are no company guidelines, the safest approach would be to only do work-related activities on the work computer so that if the issue comes up later on, you can defend your usage by explaining how those activities are reasonably related to the business. For example, I was asked why I was trying to visit some blogging site at such and such a time. I explained that I was googling an obscure error message while debugging an issue, and most of the google results linked back to a blog post of someone that had gone through the same issue and written up how they had solved the issue. They looked at the site in question, saw that it was what I described, and that was the end of it. Had I not had a valid business reason for trying to visit that site, I imagine that it would have been a bigger issue. Even if your company does not use any sort of employee monitoring software, there are other ways that the company could find out if an employee has been doing something not related to work on a work computer: 

If your manager had you working on a project for several months, his manager must have been aware that you were working on this project. You should approach that person, even if they are in a new role, for advice on the status of the project and how to proceed. 

Your academic and professional background is non-traditional for both getting an internship (you are not enrolled as a student) or getting a job as a developer (you do not have a bachelor's degree). This may make it difficult but not impossible to get either. If this is something you want though you should try anyway. You should focus on demonstrating your skills and your dedication to a career in software to potential companies. An internship can be a good way to do this. A portfolio on GitHub or similar site can also help. Industry certifications and reading up on current trends are also helpful. In short, expect it to be difficult but you can't succeed without trying. Be prepared to interview at several companies and learn from your unsuccessful attempts. 

To maximize your chances of getting these year end perks, you should not submit your notice until after you receive them. 

Most likely not, but you can always ask. If you are a consultant, your hotel costs are probably billed straight through to the client so you would be saving the client money and not your company. If you are an employee, giving you a raise equivalent to the amount you are saving the company in hotel costs would cost the company more than that amount. If your travel schedule stops, then the company saves 100% of your travel costs but still continues to have to pay you a higher salary if they give you a raise. Similarly, if your circumstances in Hong Kong change and you need to stay in a hotel, the company still has to pay those costs while paying you your higher salary. 

The other contacts may use the information they received in the message when interacting with your manager and your manager may figure out that you sent the information to other recipients. If anyone who is BCCed on the original email uses "reply all" to email a response, both you and your manager will receive that response and your manager will definitely know that you sent this information to other contacts. If the email message goes back and forth between you and your manager multiple times, you may forget to add the contact back into the BCC list, leaving the other contact without the full picture of what was communicated throughout the entire email exchange. The flip side of this is that you can choose when to add the contact to BCC and when to exclude them from BCC, giving you control over what information gets sent to that contact. This depends on your company culture, but as the wikipedia article states: 

As with most legalish questions, your best bet to determine the legality of a specific employment contract is to talk to an employment lawyer. With that said, as documented on wikipedia, non-compete clauses / covenants not to compete are allowed in most states of the US, but are restricted from being too broad and/or lasting too long in: 

I would consider myself lucky if every job I landed was a dream job or on my ideal career path. Sometimes you take a job because you need to pay the bills or because it is better than the alternative in your situation. There does not need to be any shame in that. With that said, you probably want to emphasize the more positive aspects of you time testing tarmac, such as how you applied what you learned to your IT career. You could do this with humor "I learned that I don't want to be testing tarmac the rest of my life" or seriousness "I learned to be diligent in my testing because there were major consequences for letting a bad batch of tarmac out" or a blend of the two, depending on your interviewer's personality. If you do this well, your tarmac experience could be unique enough to make you stand out compared to other candidates who just went from web development job to web development job with little variation. 

In our office, we have a water boiler that can keep water hot enough to make tea all day. People come and make a cup of tea at a time and refill it as needed. Perhaps you can get something like that for your office. 

The high road in this particular case would be to first convince your coworker that you have a valid argument against what he proposed, and then, together, approach your manager about revising the decision. 

Your thought process seems pretty reasonable. I would call or send an e-mail to your contact in the company and explain the situation as you have here: 

Knowing how to help yourself find relevant information is critical to on the job success. Like it or not, Google is a powerful tool for quickly answering questions. It's a good idea to do a quick search before asking others. It's like calling tech support and being able to say you already tried rebooting and it didn't help. 

This is information I appreciate having when considering a candidate. A slow recruiting process can be for any number of reasons. Knowing that the window to hire you is closing can help them accelerate it if you really are their top candidate. If you are not, they may encourage you to take the other offer and shift their attention elsewhere. 

I have heard of this in situations involving security clearance or leaving to work for companies considered competitors. In these cases, it seems like a defensive measure similar to when firing an employee. The employer has less trust that the employee will not breach agreements, cause harm, etc, even if this is inadvertent, so chooses to limit liability.
