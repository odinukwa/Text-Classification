Why did it begin then? Iceland was being settled from 874. Did immigration from Scandinavia decrease dramatically (If so, why?)? Did something in the political climate in Iceland or Scandinavian change dramatically? Did the formation of the Icelandic Commonwealth enable the island to act with much more cultural autonomy? 

I believe we can spit this up into three parts: Roman Jewish Community: "Jews have lived in Rome for over 2,000 years [...] They may even have established a community there as early as the second pre-Christian century, for in the year 139 B.C. the pretor Hispanus issued a decree expelling all Jews who were not Italian citizens" Jewish Encyclopaedia So we can pretty much discount there role there. Jews in the Levant At the time part of the Seleucid Empire. The Battle of Magnesia between them and Rome as well as the Treaty of Apamea are in scope. Jewish nationalism against the Seleucids is also in scope. It seems Jews here were largely antagonistic to the Seleucids who were at war with Rome, who were at war with Carthage. But no direct link to Roman wars in the western Mediterranean here, I think. Carthaginian Jewish Community Algerian Jews: "There is evidence of a Jewish presence in Algeria since at least the late Roman period". Out of scope, probably. Tunisian Jews : "The ruins of an ancient synagogue dating back to the 3rd-5th century CE was discovered by the French captain Ernest De Prudhomme". Excellent. There were also jews in Carthage according to the Jewish Encyclopaedia, based on evidence from the Talmud. So Jews would have been around in numbers during the Punic Wars. Did they do much fighting? There is evidence for Jewish mercenaries in Egypt here and in the Seleucid shpere of influence (Crete etc) here, search for jewish. There are stories of a Jew (I think) called Zepho running away to Carthage and becoming a general (in that first "here" link) but I think it's too early in history and I don't stand by it's validity. I would say there was a community there were involved in so far as they lived, worked, traded there. But I don't think there's much to write as far as "Jewish involvement goes". 

It's basically a simplified version of the Great Seal of the United States. It was made official insignia in 1832, source. The source has more about US rank insignia development (cockades in caps and all that). There must have been a reason though, it must have been in informal use. Wikipedia thinks this that it was used in 1805, but it's unsourced, my searches only lead to people verbatum quoting wikipedia and it got the other date wrong so I think we can disregard it for now. Wikipedia has another "fact", backed up by Ask (because of plagiarism): "There is evidence that colonels wore the eagle as rank insignia in 1829 when they transferred the gold or gilt eagles that decorated their hat cockades to their collars". Here the trail leads back to this Office of History (Sacramento Air Logistics Center, McClellan Air Force Base etc) document, which has more info unfortunately doesn't elaborate further about origins. So I think that it came into informal use and was adopted. I don't know why colonels specifically were able to do this, perhaps their uniform was ill defined or maybe it was just luck. But it is certainly not surprising that the eagle, as such a powerful symbol, made it's way in somewhere. Ps. The eagle doesn't appear similarly in the british or french rank system (obviously it is a powerful military significance to the french, but not especially to colonels), which the two systems it's reasonable to assume the American rank structure emerged from. So it's origins are not there. The great seal of the US wikipedia page will explain it's significance to the American state and by extension it's significance to the military. Which is background, but doesn't address the colonel question. 

I think the closest thing is the Early Modern Period. 1450 - 1750 as long as you're talking about Europe. It was followed by the "Age of Revolution" apparently. 

Secession is unconstitutional, so I'm not sure how official the actions towards it could be. But I do know what you mean. The Wikipedia page contains a few examples of both ridiculous and serious attempts of states to secede or to affirm their right to secede. It also details all the civil war stuff along side bizzare ideas for new states like State of Jefferson or Southern California. 

Vuvuzela and the Melodica spring to mind. Plastic aerophones like the Vuvuzela have been around since the 1960's, obviously similar looking brass instruments have been around for a long time, but specifically Vuvuzelas meet your criteria. They're a bit of a gimmic, but were very popular at the 2010 World Cup and have seen widespread use. More Melodica's were invented in the 1950s. You see them all over the place. They're not Zanzithophones, they are acoustic. Here is one at work, okay fine here's one at work The modern Double French Horn either just misses it with the first prototype being made in 1897, or just sneaks in with Fritz Kruspe patenting it in 1900. But it is not a radically new instrument compared to older horns, it just combined the Bb horn and F horn together into one instrument with some clever plumbing. 

While Christmas has roots far in the past, many of our traditions in the English world were introduced by the Victorians. This was the period that moulded Christmas into important celebration is it today, deciding on the themes we recognise (charity, goodwill, gift giving etc), the traditions (many drawn from Germanic ones) and even the commercialism (cards, Christmas crackers etc) This BBC link should be useful. As for the pre-Christian background: check out the wikipedia page for Christmas. "Modern Christmas customs include: gift-giving and merrymaking from Roman Saturnalia; greenery, lights, and charity from the Roman New Year; and Yule logs and various foods from Germanic feasts". Actually, read all of that section. This Britannica article goes into some other detail. It also mentions Mithras. (There is lots of info online, but I hesitate to link to non-wikipedia or encyclopaedia articles on such a touchy issue). This is decent where it provides references but has a massive agenda. Bonus: If you think Christmas is mostly about the food (who can blame you) you'll find this answers everything. 

In the Kronstadt Rebellion soviet forces advanced over seasonal sea ice to attack a rebelling naval fortification. Once again, at the Battle of Ogdensburg, during the War of 1812, British forces attacked American forces over the frozen St Lawrence river. In this case coming under artillery fire whilst on the river, which must have been interesting. 

I would say innovations in 19th century warfare led to the Civil War being what it was, rather than the Civil War being a great innovative time. Like Minie Ball, a new type of bullet design, which increased the lethality of engagements. It had been used already in the Crimea on a smaller scale, but like Ironclads or Gatling guns, saw it's first large outing in the Civil War . But I suppose the other side of that coin is how militaries adapted to these changes, like with the use of trench warfare (as pointed out by T.E.D.) or even use of balloons. But I would say that the Civil War was marked by a failure to innovate, the tacticians failure to abandon close order formations in the face of the Minie Ball being a great example: link p89 details use of close order formations 

The nature of the silk road meant that it had to pass through commercial centres. "The Silk Road was largely fragmented and very few merchants travelled the whole route. Goods were passed from one merchant to another until it reached the final buyers" source So deviation over the steppes wasn't really possible as it was not the intermediaries goal to eventually get goods to europe from china (say, because many goods didn't start that far east and very few made it that far west) but maybe just to get it to the next city. However, there were alternatives to the overland silk road further south. Indian Ocean Trade had long been an interface between east and west, with entry to the Mediterranean being through the Red Sea and egypt rather than the Anatolia. 

I don't know whether this is example of people deliberately drinking beer rather than water for it's protective effects. But there is certainly an interesting case study to be had in the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. Wikipedia quote: 

I don't believe this is by any means conclusive, and my evidence is a touch indirect, but I think genetic analysis gives us some interesting hints. There seems to be a body of work that suggests comparisons can be made of historical events around the time of the ancient greeks by making comparisons between modern population. Y-chromosomal evidence for a limited Greek contribution to the Pathan population of Pakistan in the European Journal of Human Genetics seems to suggest preliminary evidence of a tie between greek and parthian genetics, dating from the time in history when the world experienced a sudden increase in cities called Alexandria. As far as I can see this genetic information has been recovered from modern populations. Population genetic relationships between Mediterranean populations determined by HLA allele distribution and a historic perspective in Tissue Antigens (a journal which better bedtime reading than it sounds) , also spins the story that the modern greek population betrays events dating back to the time of the Pharaohs. 

I've found some evidence during the Mongol invasion of Japan (it is wikipedia, but it's cited to a reasonable, but not fantastic degree): "in 1274, the Yuan fleet set out, with an estimated 15,000 Mongol and Chinese soldiers and 8,000 Korean soldiers, in 300 large vessels and 400-500 smaller craft, although figures vary considerably depending on the source" And in the following battle of Bun'ei (battle before the Kamikaze typhoon business) we find that the mongols used phalanx infantry tactics against the Japanese. This book chronicles these events. 

I'll look at non hereditary absolute rulers first, which are similar to monarchies. If you look up Dictator, you'll find examples of absolute rulers who had set terms. Roman Dicatators being the original example as well as Giuseppe Garibaldi. Many states have or have had emergency power laws that effectively result in a dictator for the duration of an emergency (although sometimes this doesn't go so well, Article 48) Protectors spring to mind as well. So do puppet rulers, colonial governors, Proconsuls and others who ruled like kings but bowed a knee to an external authority. As for monarchies, recently with Queen Beatrice's abdication we've been reminded of Dutch tradition, where an aged monarch is expected to abdicate. But did you know it was also expected in Medieval Japan, where it was practice for emperors to step aside so the heir could ascend relatively young. In addition, before Meiji Restoration it was common for empresses (women) to rule for the minimum time until a male descendant was old enough to rule. Women leaders acting as a temporary "stop-gap". None of these aren't hard and fast term limits, but they are clearly informal limits on length of rule. 

Looks like you're interested in this: $URL$ The data to answer your question is immigration stats as exact measures of hereditary do not exist. You could always subtract net immigration from population increases to get a upper bound. (You could do some maths and model immigrant pop growth, but this would be hard and would result in spurious accuracy in this case). The statement: "there was also considerable Arab immigration (partly related to the economic impetus the Jews immigrants supplied to the land)" is questionable. And the link above should help explore whether this statement is indeed true. For instance, people point out the 1931 census of Palestine only shows 2% of Arabs were born abroad at that time, but others think most immigration was unrecorded etc: a few essays worth of disagreement basically. Since it is a Israel/Palestine issue it is well cited, enjoy. 

Let me wikipedia that for you. "In the United States, there was no established rule in the 19th century. A 1927 survey of ten department stores reported that pink was preferred for boys in six of them and for girls in four. The foremost student of the role of color in children's fashion, Jo Paoletti, found that "By the 1950s, pink was strongly associated with femininity" but to an extent that was "neither rigid nor universal" as it later became." 

I'm sorry to throw a PhD dissertation at you. But I believe Food shortages and economic institutions in the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea addresses your concerns. From page 168 (179 on the freely viewable pdf). Addresses whether there was a famine using the accounts you have hinted at as well as UN figures, with comparison to official DPRK figures. It looks at the evidence we have for their production, their consumption of food aid, amost other things. edit: The sources he's used that I've looked at are UNICEF, ROK figures (probably not what you wanted) and NGO figures like the KBSM below. Some of the data used but not given can be found in Forced Migration and Mortality. The abstract is of interest but too long to post, here is some of it: Buddhist Sharing Movement (KBSM) released a report on the North Korean food crisis based on interviews with North Korean migrants in China ... FIGURES HERE... “that the worst famine in human history is now transpiring in North Korea” (Korean Buddhist Sharing Movement, 1998). Concerned by these accounts but unable to assess the reliability of their findings, a U.S. nongovernmental organization (NGO) active in North Korean humanitarian relief, Mercy Corps International, invited the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health to undertake its own study of North Korean migrants in China. In the past five years, significant numbers of North Koreans have been moving across the Chinese border in search of food for themselves and their families. It is estimated that between 50,000 and 150,000 North Koreans are staying temporarily in China... 

There's already an answer on tactics. But there are a few quite interesting anti horse pieces of equipment that are worth mentioning. Like the Cheval de frise, an anti cavalry obstacle. Or the Caltrop: "sharp nails or spines arranged in such a manner that one of them always points upward from a stable base", designed to puncture the soft feet of cavalry mounts. The Caltrop and similar devices are still used today against wheeled vehicles. Another "area denial" weapon used against both horses and infantry was the Trou de loup, a device you might recognise as "Punji sticks". The Zhanmadao, literally "horse chopping saber", was a single-bladed anti-cavalry Chinese sword. It was especially common during the Song Dynasty (960-1279). 

I don't know about what happened to the church during the great events of the 20th century but apparently no one does, so I'll try to provide some modern context. It seems likely that like other Greek Orthodox churches this belongs to the Greek orthodox church. I did explore whether there was involvement of government conservation organisation, but I didn't find anything. Private ownership and maintenance seems to be the deal with similar buildings in Israel/Palestine and specifically the Jericho area. Looking at the legal map and this walking map it seems like the Monastery fits into either Area C or (more likely) the regional council jurisdictional area. This means the area is under Israeli control, whether that be directly or through the settler regional council. So you can assume current Palestinian governance has very little to do with the place. You can see recent road development done by the Israelis that highlights acknowledgement of the tourist value as well as opposition by the Palestinians towards the road (Israeli presence) and perhaps even the presence of the Greek monks ("Another Palestinian minister said the monks’ presence “gave a deceiving impression” about the status of the land around St. George’s"). 

No. "No one will receive the $25 million reward for the capture of Osama bin Laden, say U.S. officials, because the raid that killed the al Qaeda leader in Pakistan on May 2 was the result of electronic intelligence, not human informants." I suppose the US considers it's electronic surveillance and an operational mistake by Al-Qaeda to be key. Apparently no human intelligence was enough like "there he is, where's my money" (there may be a technical term for that) to warrant payment. U.S. Will Not Pay $25 Million Osama Bin Laden Reward, Say Officials As to what they will use it for. Either it's more money for the State Department, or (and I think this is more likely) less federal spending. 

Eisenhower perhaps qualifies, who was Military Governor of the U.S. Occupation Zone in Germany from the end of WW2 up to November 1945. He was responsible for the Joint Chiefs of Staff's directive 1067, the blueprint for rebuilding Germany after the war. He was responsible for distribution of food, medicine, dealing with the concentration camps and providing civil order/justice. 

There is the obvious geo-political gain of weakening their British enemies, who had seen such expansion in that theatre during the seven year war. Come the next war (Napoleonic, yes, unfortunately not so much of a gain for the Bourbons) the United states offered both trade to France and co-belligerency (1812 war). However, I get the feeling France expected more. Can't find a source for that right now though. This is what wikipedia thinks by the way. They think France dropped the ball as well.
