Express it exactly as you have:The degree earned, the name and location of the school, and when it was earned. Some will debate about including the date earned, but most applications ask for it. When a CV/resume is used across international borders it is likely that the person reading the CV doesn't have a clue about the quality of the school or the quality of the exact program. It is even true if the degree is earned in the same country. Frequently the person reading that part of the CV is trying to ascertain if the you have the equivalent of a bachelors, masters or doctorate. Regarding the the term Information technology or Software development: Even in the US these terms have no specific meaning. I have seen US high schools put all programming classes under the Math department, the Business department, or group them with all computer classes under an IT department. Some US colleges have IT majors and Computer Programing and Software Engineering with great overlaps between the classes. The big difference may be in the amount of math required, and that can't be determined by the title. 

Know the company policies about vacation and how they pay it out. If they pay you for unused vacation then you may decide that giving notice, then working the two weeks, and then using the payout to fund your time off before starting the new job makes more sense to you. Of course if they don't pay for unused vacation, then your plan of vacation, give notice, work for two weeks, and then start the new job is the preferable plan. It maximizes your benefits and it also has the benefit of delaying giving notice as long as possible. It the United States it also has the effect of minimizing gaps in insurance coverage it that applies in your situation. 

You want to tell your employer first so they can tell the team who they want to nominate to replace you. In a team environment multiple companies may be involved. If company A can't fill the slot quickly, then all the companies are given an opportunity to find a candidate. The additional time you give your employer allows them to find candidates, interview them, and craft a response all before their competitor are aware there is an opening. If you tell your teammates first, your company will now be the last to know about the opening. The competition will use that extra time to identify possible replacements. 

There are two issues. 1) Does the employer even care. Many don't. They realize that many programmers are unable to show the code they have developed. They may never check the site. 2) Your partners may not want to have the code shared. The 2nd one could be a red flag if a potential employer realizes that you exposed the code without the permission of the rest of the team. They might worry that you will do the same thing with their proprietary code. Unless everybody agrees to expose the code, then exposing the code is too risky. 

Yes PDF is generally acceptable, but it depends on the company. I have also found that having a txt file version allows you to copy the text quickly into the entry boxes on the website without requiring a lot of tweaking. The software the company is using will scan the documents for key words. In the past applicants wanted to submit via PDF because it made it more difficult for the companies that were more interested in collecting resumes to modify the resume. You want to be able to generate a good looking document in several formats based on the requirements of the company. You can use whatever software you want to maintain the resume, you just need to be willing to export it in multiple formats. It is always a good idea to bring nice looking copies of the resume to the interview to make sure the interviewers have a good copy. I experienced trying to conduct an interview when the only copy of the resume was the one that was cobbled together from the input text boxes on the website. Not very pretty. 

As a recruiter I would expect to see exactly what you observed. Understanding that some students have limited funds or limited access to nice clothes, the expectations of how they will dress at the job fair doesn't equal how they will dress at the job. My advice is if you own a suit, and can get to it, then wear it. If you don't have a suit, but have a sport coat or can borrow one, then wear that. Never go in less than a nice shirt and a tie, borrow them from a friend, roommate, parent. The pants and shoes should be appropriate to the suit, sports coat, or just a tie. You will never be overdressed by what you choose. I understand you may be meeting with multiple companies, and have decided to dress for the one with the highest standards, based on what you have access too. I will also not downgrade you if I feel that this is the best you can do. If your approach to the job air was non-serious it will show through in other ways. The only wrinkle you have is logistics because of the relationship between your home and the campus, and your other activities that day. 

A quick note is a good idea. I would always follow up with my Point of contact if the place I am sending the documents is different from the email of my POC, that way you are sure that the POC has been alerted to the fact that they should have received the documents. In cases where the POC is the person I sent the documents to, I try to come up with a question that I need to raise, about the next step or the previous step, so the email doesn't seem like needless checking. 

One advantage of mentioning the current unrelated job is that it shows that you are employed in city X. Instead of showing that your current job is in another country, or that your most recent job ended last year. It also shows that you have the necessary work permits for the country where you are looking for a job. 

If I saw this type of announcement I would move on and look for ome company that wouldn't put my current job at risk. Why would they want on people who fit those categories? 

Citizenship status is a complex issue. If the position is one that the customer (US Government) is going to require that they have reached a certain level of citizenship, then the company has to require it. If the job is for low pay, and the candidate needs visa sponsorship, they may feel that the cost and paperwork involved may make that candidate too expensive. Now directly addressing your question. You may have a false assumption in the question. I went to the EEOC site to see what they say about this topic. 

I have done this. I told them that my family situation necessitated a review of some parts of the benefits package prior to accepting the position. I have never had a problem getting an advance copy of these documents. For items that are a little more complex (IP issues) you should be able to get a copy of the documents they will be asking you to sign on day 1. They should also be able to give you any other related documents. For some topics (vacation, 401K matching) that is an integral part of the offer. I generally haven't even had to ask, most companies gave me the basic info as a part of the offer letter. In some cases it was a 10 page pdf file, and in other cases it was a hard copy document that was overnighted to my house. In one case there was a website for you to visit during the week the offer was open. 

Start today. The goal is to have an firm offer in your hand by the time they announce who is being laid off. You might even decide to move before you find out, or you might decide to move even if you survive the cuts. Management knows, or should know, that the stampede out the door has already begun. be glad they gave you months, they could have given you no notice. 

Many people graduate from college with zero experience in their field. During high school and college the bulk of their work experience is delivering Pizza, flipping burgers or working as a lifeguard. They fund the schooling with these low skill jobs, the parents, plus financial aid. Yet near the end of the time in school they find internships. Work with your school to locate internships. They can help you with your resume. Change how you introduce and describe yourself. You describe yourself as: I am currently an automotive technician getting a degree in computer science and applying for internships. You need to change it to: I am earning a degree in computer science and I am currently applying for internships. Your job history section shows your work as an automotive technician, but many employers don't expect new graduates to have a ton of relevant work experience. And many hiring interns expect even less. 

You have two problems. Most companies don't want to discuss different rates for similar job descriptions. They can base the different rates on their historical ability to find people at that rate. They can even base it on region of the country. If they are a government contracting company they can base it on what the customer is willing to pay for those skills. They may not even understand why the government sets the rates at the level they do but they maximize the rate they can charge, and pay the least that they can under contracting law. The bigger issue is you can't say: Joe let me have access to a set I files I wasn't supposed to see. I read those files, made copies of company proprietary data and didn't secure them, and now want to use them as leverage to get a pay increase. If they don't fire you right away consider yourself lucky. Unless you know they discriminated against you, or a protected class of people, it will never get you a raise. 

In the united states most employers will only confirm that you did work there, the dates of your employment, and a job title. The job title doesn't tell you anything because there is no standard table that converts a tile to a pay scale. When your current employer is contacted because you are applying for a loan they will also confirm your salary. The bank is making sure that the information on the pay stubs is legitimate. In many cases both inquires are handled by a office, or somebody at the end of a 1-800 number. I have seen companies advertise two different numbers depending on the reason for the inquiry. Why are they asking? They want to gauge the range of salary you will be looking for. The range for you will depend on what you are making, your reason for leaving, current employment status, your prospects for getting several offers. It is also based on how realistic your goals are. They don't want to waste their time pushing you for positions you will never take. Or waste your time so that you won't work with them any longer.
