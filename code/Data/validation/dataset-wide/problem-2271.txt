have you observed that these are typically used by people who do a lot of tasks that require arm strength? Be it Baseball, be it Basketball, We've seen Cricket Fast Bowlers using these.. 

Apart from what all options suggested by other users here, If you are up for investing a bit, You might want to look out for Neoprene shampoos that are used by Scuba Divers to clean their Scuba suits. The Bacteria and the stinking has a close relation. The other way to go is Vinegar with water. A bucket of water with 2-3 tablespoons of vinegar should do. The Ph kills the bacteria if there are any. If you don't have access to newspapers, is it the same for tissue-paper? They would work just fine. 

There is a good answer already. But I have some deeper thoughts: Snakes are possibilities. They are diversified, and classified over a huge range. Just as per their physical parameters, there are other aspects to differentiate.. like habits, habitat, and another aspect that catches lesser thoughts is Locomotion. We all know some snakes move fast (although a very relative term with no reference), some don't. If I ask a person how did it go? He/She would most likely reply bluntly that "It glided!" Barring the locomotion of aquatic snakes (Hydrophiinae) and sticking strictly to the terrestrial locomotion, we can say that they have different locomotion types. Usually the type of locomotion depends on the species and what is it doing. 

I'll answer about India, and Indian Railways. While in India, you can't call it legally approved to be okay to walk on railway tracks. I'd say the way things are taken is depending upon where you are. Officially, trespassing any of the Railway property without being a passenger on a train or an authorized person to be there is illegal. Its quite unfortunate to say, but with Indian Railways the things aren't so straight, There are Gray shades between how Law and Order are maintained in Indian Railways. For example, a plastic garbage collecting guy who is not an employee of Indian Railways is allowed to walk through and along the tracks to pick up plastic waste, mostly water bottle which are recycled. (Why such a job is needed is a question worth not wasting any time here), Whereas a Railway Gang-man, an employee of the Indian Railway is supposed to be walking on railway tracks to ensure the track are intact and safe. Its his job. I have walked on tracks over longer distances because there isn't any alternative to it unless I was ready to walk twice the distance. During that walk I came across a couple of Railway sub-section offices, traction centers and a few Railways officials too. They looked perfectly okay with me walking along the track, but it doesn't mean it is legal to do so. 

I personally had a similar sort of a question when I first went through similar kind of stats about these mountains. Getting introduced with these stats is different than totally understanding the mountain and the pandora box it opens. For getting acquainted with the reasons for so many failed attempts, one needs to read tactical data and expedition reports. Understanding the weather is not a case because many a times bad weather make a walk in a park kind of a summit go horribly wrong. 

While the answers above mainly focus on getting a Easy-To-Carry (new) instrument, I'll stick to an attempt of answering how can one carry a standard guitar like the one I have (a Pluto, acoustic). EDIT: As the question was having an edit about travelling guitars, I am afraid I have no experience with them, but I'd rather think that same packing technique can be applied to those guitars as well. I hope it is okay if I assume that you have at least a minimal guitar carrying case. If not, then its a good idea to invest into one. With a standard guitar like the one I have, made up of wood, its very much possible that it can suffer damage from extreme changes in temperature and humidity, getting wet. And a severe impact during transit and/or walk can crack the wood if hit badly. 

I'd rather not prefer inviting them for food at all. Usually for what I have seen around, crows scare the hell out of small birds like Bulbul, Robin and Sunbirds. They feast on roadside kills, trashed food, whatever that feels eatable to them in a garbage dump, in short, whatever that appears pretty much unhygienic. Considering the hygiene I imagine having crows sharing the food with other birds is not a good idea. 

I know how the last man rappel. While practicing at a local place, I saw one of the groups using a kamikaze knot for rappel and rope retrieval after the last man rappelled. Kamikaze and Sheepshank are quite the same. 

Through these kind of questions, I'd come to know if they are really scared of them through unfortunate encounters or are they scared just by the stories people tell. Sometimes over-exaggerated descriptions/discussions (or plain lie) can make one feel scared of snakes, and its not entirely the person's fault. These self-answerable questions are need to be asked so that they believe with adequate knowledge they can take of their own safety. Get the thought-process going. Let the questions come from their side as well. If I see the person is interested to know a bit more, I think I have broken the ice, but at the same time it is essential to tell them not to try doing things they have never tried or have experience of. e.g. Tom says, "Hey snakes are not really animals who want to kill humans, see there is this rattler and its not gonna kill me, WedaPashi says the same." Tom does not panic this time (Amazing start!), Tom is not scared (bring it on!), Tom doesn't run away (Way to go boy!) but he does what shouldn't do and gets bitten and is dead (Shuddder!). At Tom's funeral Dick says to Harry, "Bloody rattlers. They all want to kill you. It bit Tom on purpose, I saw, it jumped way far than its length and you know Tom is always scared of snakes and karma got to him. WedaPashi is weirdo, snakes don't bite him for some reason." Tom's father spend the rest of the days shooting snakes with shotgun, Dick and Harry never went hiking/camping for the rest of their lives which they lived through hating snakes all the while. WedaPashi is labelled abnormal freak by the duo. Or, e.g. Tom says, "Hey snakes are not really animals who want to kill humans, see there is this rattler and its not gonna kill me, WedaPashi says the same." Tom does not panic this time (Amazing start!), Tom is not scared (bring it on!), Tom doesn't run away (Way to go boy!) but he does what shouldn't do and handles the snake in a way he shouldn't, The innocent snake gets injured, or is killed (Shudder!). At the bar, Tom is on cloud no.9 and Dick says to Harry, "Bloody rattlers. I thought they all want to kill you. But you know what, they can't. I saw, it tried to hide, skid away but you know what(!), Tom who is always scared of snakes, got hold of it. He squeezed it hard with a stick so that it doesn't run away. We clicked some pictures. It was great." Dick dies trying the same and Tom started hating snakes again, more this time. Tom and Harry never went hiking/camping for the rest of their lives which they lived through hating snakes all the while. WedaPashi is labelled abnormal freak by the duo. Either ways, if I talked Tom away from his aversion to this stage, I am at fault, its my mistake entirely. Based on the probability of coming across a snake, I'd identify if the person really needs to come and see it and is ready for it or not. Its not necessary to make the person touch or handle a snake. Visual memories/representation (like we see in movies) plays major role in aversion towards snakes. May be I can locate a snake basking in the sunlight, not willing to harm anyone around, and show that to the person from a safe distance. That might change the image he/she has of snakes in his/her mind (The one with aggressive eyes, unusually big fags). Its unlike other stuff like swimming, speed, etc. Aversion towards animals, can be overcome by educating, which does not require contact beyond a certain barrier. You need not be sitting on an elephant or feeding it haystack if you are scared of it. You need not be a handling a non-venomous snake to realize that you are not scared of it or no longer hating it. If at all I am not able to get the person thinking and the person is not really able to break the nutshell, its absolutely fine. I must have tried enough to educate him/her at least in a direction which delivers overall awareness and might help keeping both of them a bit more safer. 

Recently I had been to a hike where I had to cross quite a large stream. And I am not so good at swimming either. So after judging the possible depth, I could figure out that I can get across swimming through it. For safety reasons considering a not-so-good kind of guy with me, I picked the shallowest part of the stream. The disadvantage was: The currents were stronger at shallow waters. So, we had struggle a bit to cross it at first place, and then had to further make our way through slippery rocks of the gorge as we moved ahead with current than we first had anticipated.
