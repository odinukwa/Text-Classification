Christopher Norris, in his book Quantum Theory and the Flight from Realism, draws some parallels between the 'many worlds' QM theory as presented by David Deutsch, and the possible worlds theory of David Lewis: 

There are a number of comments on the 'mystical' in the Tractatus which are related to the doctrine of showing what cannot be said, but this doctrine was abandoned by the later Wittgenstein as confused. There is no such thing as ineffable metaphysics. Those modern philosophers however, like Dummett and Davidson, who have revived the old Tractatus approach to philosophy, could well be said to be committed to mystical, or supernatural views, about the nature of the world, reality etc. I do not see, though, that they have solved any 'problems' in these areas any more than Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas or Descartes solved them. 

A.J. Ayer, Language, Truth and Logic, p. 107 Wittgenstein always rejected the scientism of the Vienna Circle so I think it is possible he was only speaking about traditional philosophical claims about ethics rather than ethical statements per se, though from reading the Tractatus alone and taking it at face value, it is understandable why they read him in the way they did. 

There is a traditional view of logic coming from the Port-Royal Logic, and inherited by Frege and Russell, that logic is a set of laws, the laws of thought (Frege), or the most abstract laws of reality itself (Russell). Wittgenstein proposed a radically different view of logic in which he questioned the nature of the compulsion of logic. He regarded logic not as a set of laws, but a set of rules. These are not made true by reality, human consensus, or by the nature of thought or the universe. Rather, they are grounded in human activities of inferring, contradicting, asserting and denying. These activities are the bedrock from which we may formulate rules which we then call logic. These rules clarify and specify the nature of and rules for doing these activities properly. Different logics just give different rules for inferring, denying etc. which might be useful in different contexts. Mathematics is not generally reducible to logic, as Russell and Frege had both hoped. According to Wittgenstein, mathematics is founded in empirical human activities such as measuring and calculating. In general, mathematics specifies rules which license the transformation of empirical statements. e.g. because 2 + 2 = 4 is a rule of arithmetic, the inference from "I had two apples and I bought two more, so I have four apples" is licensed, i.e. it is a valid inference because the rules allow the transformation from the premise to the conclusion. Empirical claims are always contingent. Logic and mathematics are deemed necessarily true, but this is for Wittgenstein just a way of saying they are rules of the games we play with language, rules of making sense. It is an error of philosophy to treat the necessity of logic and mathematics as a kind of super-rigid empirical force, an error upon which most metaphysical theories are based, such as mathematical Platonism. The traditional view is that logic and mathematics are descriptive, while Wittgenstein's conception of them is that they are normative, i.e. conceptually related to rules, not reality. This is very, very brief summary of the description of Wittgenstein's view of mathematics and logic in Baker and Hacker's volume 2 of their Analytical Commentary on Wittgenstein's text Philosophical Investigations. 

Kripke is discussing section 193 of Philosophical Investigations, where Wittgenstein draws a distinction between a machine as an idealized symbol of a rule-following or law-governed mechanism, and a machine as a real object whose behaviours and operations are subject to failure. Wittgenstein here was particularly concerned with trying to shed light on the concept of rule-following, the idea that following a rule means we somehow grasp all the infinite instances of behavior that could be thought to be in accord with the rule. He was saying that the instances are not mysteriously contained 'in' the rule, but rather the idea of a rule is an idealization and to be understood as more like a general ability represented by specific behaviors than an infinite number of possible occurrences. This could apply to functionalism, one of the traditional tenets of which is that dispositions to behavior are encoded in actual brain states. (It is possible that forms of functionalism can be characterized without reference to brain states, but I do not know of anyone who has actually suggested this). That is to suggest there are actual states in the brain which encode or contain 'in' them an infinite number of possible behavioral outputs. This is the same basic error as thinking of rules as mysteriously 'containing' their instances. Naturally, Wittgenstein does not himself mention functionalism, which originated after his death. Hilary Putnam, more influenced by logical positivism than the later Wittgenstein, was its chief advocate, though he himself later abandoned it. Kripke's discussion of Wittgenstein on rule-following is notoriously idiosyncratic, and seems overly concerned with reading into W a 'skeptical' method, a reading which has been very controversial. For an alternative, detailed analysis of W on rule following, Baker and Hacker's Language, Rules and Necessity remains the locus classicus. 

I'll try and rephrase your question and then possibly answer it: "How can anything happened in a completely determined system?" It reads that the following is the crux of your argument (which I rewrote for you): 

Everything we have come to know is an illusion of difference. From this, we have come to the wrong conclusions about free will, "creation", etc.. However, we are all one and imperishable. But, it would then follow that motion cannot be. This was a big problem for Plato. If every point in the universe is filled with matter, then if any bit of matter moves, then there is a difference between the prior position and the current one. But we can't have difference because this would assume that there was a part of existence that the matter could move into and thus contradict both the assumed plenum and the true lack of difference. So, we come to a somewhat paradoxical conclusion that all of existence really has no motion or direction. Everything just is, is one, and is still. If this were the only assumption and there was no account for a beginning of creation, then we could accept pure nihilism. Hmmm. Case 2 (no plenum): Everything is completely determined, but there are empty spaces in the universe. This case is more aligned with current models in physics than the previous case. Nevertheless, we still have determinism from material finitude. From that we can once again extrapolate various claims of nihilism and meaninglessness. Not very exciting of a framework, huh? Anyway, your thought: 

was right. From the conditions you gave were not entirely satisfactory for an certainty of a conclusion. I suggest taking your thoughts backwards causally (what I stopped myself from doing earlier). By working backwards, you'll possibly come to a cause of the existence of everything and thus learn more about the finitude in which you're thinking. Otherwise, we have a nebulous account of deterministic existence, that assumes all things are and are matter, which was historically bonked over the head and thrown into a dream world by Descartes and then later crushed by Kant ("the crusher of everything" -Schopenhauer). So that premise has some philosophical problems too. Good luck. 

From looking at the meaning of deliberately, to do something deliberately would be to do something with intent and reason. Now looking at your three sentences, there is a question of who thinks S ought to do A and how S ought to do A. (1): The one asserting the sentence is claiming that any agent S ought to do A deliberately. Here, S does not necessarily already believe that he/she/it ought to do A deliberately, but rather the assert-er does. There is an additional condition in (1) regarding the manner in which S does A. If S were to do A unintentionally, then S messed up. However, this is interpreting "deliberately speaking" as "with deliberateness." If such is not the case, then "deliberately speaking" refers to the manner in which the assert-er is asserting. The addition then says nothing regarding S or A but is a rhetorical appeal to the methodology in which the assert-er is working. (2): Unlike (1), this sentence does not say anything about the assert-er. We are assuming S's beliefs and what S knows to be true and deducting a normative claim from that set. (3): This sentence differs from (1) and (2) in that it is, prima facie, a nonethical statement. If we equivocate an "instrumentally rational" action with an action that ought to be done, then we can say that (3) is no different than (2). However, this assumes a lot about S and A that we don't know. Let's also look at how "instrumentally rational" could be true, while "ought" would not. Suppose that for S, following every instruction in the Torah is an ethical necessity that ought to be done. Yet, S cannot find any instrumentally rational deduction as to why S ought to live a kosher life. This does presuppose that S does not consider any deduction including a faith-based claim to be rational, but we can easily allow this to occur since (3) does not mandate S to be infallible. 

This is extremely reminiscent of Spinoza's account of the universe. In brief, he assumes that there are substances and modes, which are independently and dependently existing respectively. From this, he deduces that there must be one infinite substance (he calls God) that contains all possible things within it in infinite ways (Prop XVI, Part I, Ethics). However, from your cosmological account, it really shouldn't matter from what position we begin in explaining all of existence, since whatever happened happened, and now we're stuck with absolute finitude. So, I will restrict myself to just this claim and attempt to not predicate any particular assumptions for its cause. I will assume that you are personifying "law" rhetorically and not making an implicit assumption for the existence of a God. If you were, then we'd be in a heap of trouble philosophically. If we are absolutely determined and in accordance to the principle of sufficient reason, then it follows that there is no free will--I cannot freely choose my actions. From your statement,
