Stocks are not money. The valuation of a company - the market captialisation - is the number of shares multiplied by the share price. The share price is the price people are willing to trade at right now. It does NOT mean all the shares have been traded at that price. If a company issues 1 million shares, at a starting price of £10, the market cap is £10 million. They may only sell a few of these shares, so much less than £10 million actually changes hands. If the price rises to £20, only a few of the shares changed hands at that price - but the market cap is reflected in all the shares, and is now £20 million. People have commented on the flaws in this methodology. The same happens in a crash. Only a fraction of the shares actually change hands, but the media report on the change in the market cap. If you want an analogy, consider a house burning down. You buy the house for £200,000. Then it sadly burns down (and without insurance). It is now worth £0. However, no money has been created or destroyed; it's a loss of value of an asset. 

Suppose three advertisers, I, II, III are participating in an auction for three positions for online advertising, top, middle and bottom. Assume that click per second for a position is not affected by who poses an advertisement there. For top, the click through rate is 3 click per second, for middle, it's 2, for bottom, it's 1. But advertisers have private value per click. For I, it's \$16 per click. For II, it's \$15. For III, it's \$14. The one who submits the highest wins the top position and pays the second highest bid, second highest bidder got the middle position and pays the third highest bid. The third highest bidder end up with bottom position, but pays zero. If there's a tie, then choose the winner ramdomly by a fair dice. The strategy space for each bidder is $\mathbb{R}_{+}$. There're a lot of NE for this game. For example, I,II,III simultaneously submit bids of, \$7 per click, \$9 per click, \$11 per click respectively. Their payoff will be $1 \times (16-0)$ dollars, $2\times (15-7)$ dollars, and $3 \times (14-9)$ dollars respectively. $$ \begin{array}{c|l|c|r} \hline &(0,7) & (7,9) & (9,11) & (11, +\infty)\\ \hline \text{player I}& \color{blue}{16} & \color{blue}{16} & 2(16-9)=14& 3(16-11)=15 \\ \hline \text{player II}& 15 & 2(15-7)=\color{blue}{16} & 2(15-7)=\color{blue}{16}& 3(15-11)=12 \\ \hline \text{player III}& 14 & 2(14-7)=14 & 3(14-9)= \color{blue}{15} & 3(14-9)= \color{blue}{15}\\ \hline \end{array} $$ How to find other NE? Added: I want to study this numerical example, because I want to understand better the motivation of this paper. 

I'm from the UK, where there is an extensive welfare system and extra investment in education in deprived areas, called the Pupil premium. Although, not nearly as much as suggested by the paper you reference. Many people do not support the pupil premium. There is a large "squeezed middle" in the UK, not poor enough for extra support, not rich enough for private schools, and this group sees extra support for deprived areas as unfair. 

There are 22,000 Vietnamese Dong to a USD, making it one of the world's least valued currency units. But denominations under 1,000 are rarely used (in tourist areas at least). They might as well say it's 22 Dong to a dollar - the zeros make no practical difference. The zeros remain because back in 1985 they revalued the Dong (1 new dong worth 10 old dong) and this led to inflation. So I understand their reluctance to repeat this. There is a general trend that poorer countries have less valuable currency units. But it's not a strict rule. Vietnam, for example, is not the poorest country in the world. Before the introduction of the Euro, the Italian Lira was a notable example of a developed economy with a low-valued currency unit. You see the locals' attitude to money expressed in the currency. While in developed countries people throw small change into jars at home, this is not the case in poorer countries. In India, coins are rarely used, and you can see from the heavily worn low-denomination notes, how these have been carefully kept inside clothes and shoes. Money is more precious with extreme poverty. I find the Thai Baht to have an especially convenient value - about 35 to a dollar. A very pleasant currency to use. Although technically subdivided into 100 satang, the satang is not much used. That makes the Western practice of pounds and pence or dollars and cents look like unnecessary complexity. 

Notice that we only need to check the first three steps, what Ann believes Bob believes Ann believes is the same as what Ann believes Bob believes Ann believes $\ldots$ Bob believes Ann believes. The same procedure applies to a similar situation of interchanging Ann and Bob in the above reasoning. To make the baseline result that common belief implies backward induction, we can switch to hyperreal-valued belief system. Specifically, a player will not rule out any of her opponent's strategies. If she believes an opponent is rational, and strategy $s_1$ yields higher payoff compared with $s_2$ for this opponent, then she will believe that $s_1$ is infinitely more likely than $s_2$. Now, if it's the case that Ann believes Bob is rational, then Bob should believe that then the chance Ann plays $“Out"$ at the third node conditional on that she plays $“In"$ at the first node is smaller than $\frac{2}{3}$. But if Ann believes Ann believes Bob believes Ann of type $t_a$ and $u_a$ is rational, then the standard part of the probability that Ann plays $“Out"$ at the third node conditional on that she plays $“In"$ at the first node equals $1$. Of course, exactly the same argument works for lexicographic probability which is more parsimonious. My guess is that one of drawback to prevent hyperreal probability form wide application may be that we can't define infinite product of infinitesimal number. For example, in an infinite extensive game, a player believe that the probability that the probability of reaching each node of a path equals $\epsilon$ which is the equivalence class of $(1, \frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{5}, \ldots,)$ up to a fixed ultrafilter on $\mathbb{N}$. Of course, we expect that the chance that this path is realized should also be infinitesimal. But notice that $\epsilon = \epsilon_n := \{a_i^n\}_{i \in \mathbb{Z_+}}$ in which \begin{eqnarray}a_i^n= \begin{cases} 1, &i<n \cr mn^{n-1}, &i=n \cr \frac{1}{i}, &i>n\end{cases} \end{eqnarray} Contrasted with finite product, if we define the inifinite product of hyperreal numbers as their componentwise product, then, in this case, we can make it equal any real number $m$. 

You are overthinking the definitions of inflation and deflation. There is much simpler terminology for this effect: "getting richer" and "getting poorer". I won't repeat the definition of inflation; it appears you understand what it is. But it only refers to the changing nature of prices; it doesn't account for people's ability to afford things. Regarding your assumptions: 

We often hear of countries securing foreign investment. Stores like this are trumped as major achievements. Foreign investment also has criticisms - profits generated in a country end up going abroad, and there can be national security issues. Would it make sense to print money instead? The usual argument against printing money is inflation. However, in the linked story, 30bn of foreign money is coming in, so the economy has to cope with that additional spending. If that was printed money instead, it seems that effect would be the same - at least in the local economy. The other side to this is currency markets and reserves - foreign investment creates demand for the local currency, which printing money doesn't do. 

I'm interested to know economic justifications of forgetting in various fields. On example is Green and Porter(1984). To sustain a Cartel, Cartel members have incentive to forget deviations in a sufficiently distant past. Another is Ekmekciy(2011) which shows that a rating system works better if it stops publicize misconducts, once they're old enough. Literature on a more abstract level is also welcomed, e.g. results like it's more socially desirable in a dynamic games, some agents are restricted to stationary strategies. 

I would like strongly recommend David Kreps' latest textbook, Microeconomic Foundations I: Choice and Competitive Markets . It contains true virtuosity and is very inspiring. Take utility representation theorem as an example. Kreps forsake the assumption in MWG of taking $\mathbb R^n$ as the underlying space so that readers won't be left with the false impression that this theorem is of limited interest. I also $\heartsuit$ the presentation of GE as a generalized NE which helps developing connections between different areas. 

I'm interested to know the exact magnitude of impact of Subprime Mortgages crisis on major players in investment banking. In particular, how can I find data for percentage of revenue from Subprime Mortgages in total revenue for major banks, like Goldman Sachs, Morgen Stanley, The Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers? 

It won't ever happen for all players. As a counter-example, consider an engineer who invents software that can predict when a jet engine needs maintenance. It's worth millions to the airlines, who will happily pay him for the software. He has no incentive at all to release this software as open-source. The same principle applies to all sorts of specialist software. In contrast, open-source works well for common building blocks. For example, there are all sorts of companies who need an operating system for their product - cloud providers, home network kit, super computing, all sorts. While they could build their own, it is much more efficient to have a common pool, like the Linux kernel. This environment means that companies can put paid engineers on open-source projects, and still run a profitable business. 

These seem reasonable. While they won't be constant in a real-world economy, making these kind of simplifications to build a model is completely reasonable. Bear in mind that you've not specified constant resources. So if someone finds a diamond, they get richer. There's still a constant amount of money, but they are better off. 

In Benjamin Edelman, Michael Ostrovsky, and Michael Schwarz(2007), there's a hand-waving argument to justify their setting as a game of complete information: 

This is about lexicographic probability and hyperreal-valued probability in the third paragraph. From the question and comment, it seems to me this question is more related to the usefulness of hyperreal numbers rather than surreal numbers. One of central and controversial question in game theory was under what setting, common belief of rationality implies backward induction(see Aumann(1995), (1998) and Binmore(1996)). 

I think this is a poor oversimplication of Robert Lucas's maxim. It's one thing that Robert Lucas models markets as if "always in equilibrium", it's quite another Robert Lucas claims it's an empirical truth that "market is always in equilibrium". Lucas(1978) explained briefly why he chose such methodology which doesn't faithfully reflects reality: 

Consider a three-legged centipede game of incomplete information with Harsanyi's universal type space. Ann of type $t_a$ believes that Bob plays $``In"$, while Ann of type $u_a$ believes that Bob plays $“Out”$ . Bob, on the other hand believes Ann is type $u_a$ and plays $``Out"$. Then at the state $(t_a, (In,Out),Out)$ that is not the backward induction path, common belief of rationality still holds. What we need to verify are, at the given state: 

In Europe, shop prices are typically displayed including VAT. This gives the impression that the seller is paying the VAT. They have to offer a competitive price, then a percentage of that is taken out as tax. But, if VAT didn't exist, sellers could offer a lower price. So in another sense, buyers pay the tax. In the US, sales tax is typically added at the till. This makes it feel like the buyer is paying the tax. But ultimately, VAT and sales tax are the same (at the point of final sale) - does it really make a difference how the prices are displayed? The same issue exists with income tax, stamp duty, and presumably many other taxes. It's quite integral to Western life that income tax is paid by the employee - you hear people say "I pay my taxes, I'm part of this society". But the need to pay income tax means that employers need to pay higher wages, so the employer is bearing the cost as well. Does it make a difference what happens when the rate changes? For example, if income tax rises, typically salaries do not rise to match. But if sales tax rises, the the amount added at the till immediately rises too. 

Can we have some other implication, like, If a game admits a unique Nash equilibirum, does common knowledge of rationality implies Nash equilibirum? 

This question arises from reading of Sannikov and Scrzypacz (2007) and Green and Porter(1984), which are modeling the same thing, dynamic collusion under imperfect monitoring, in a continuous-time version and a discrete-time version. Their choice of different noises term are crucial to derivation of their conclusions. My question is how to decide which one is dominant for a particular market(e.g. European banana market) regarding the modeling of noises. My guess is that multiplicative noise term is more relevant to shocks of weather, additive accumulative noise term(following Brownian motion in Sannikov and Scrzypacz's case) is more relevant to shocks related to institution, say, cultural revolution and Khomeini's return to Iran. 

I assume that $r(t)$ is continuous. The idea is that, this Poisson process with time-varying parameter $r(t)$, as the limit of Bernoulli trial with time-varying probability of success, is memoryless: For a generic finite partition $\mathscr{P}$ of $[0, T]$ as $\{[0,t_1),[t_1,t_2),[t_2,t_3) \ldots,[t_{n-1},T]\}$, let the $n$th cell following a Poisson distribution with a fixed parameter $r(t_n)$, so $$P_{\mathscr{P}} = 1 - \underbrace{e^{\sum_{k=1}^n-r(t_k)(t_k-t_{k-1})}}_{\text{Probability of no accidents}}$$. So $P = 1 - e^{-\int_0^Tr(t)dt}$. Notice that the Riemann integral $\int_0^Tr(t)dt$ is the limit of a net indexed by the set of all finite partitions of $[0,T]$ with vanishing maximal length of cell with respect to number of cells. $f(x)=1-e^{-x}$ is continuous, so this limit preserves. 

This is not a reasonable assumption. Constant prices would imply that there is government control of prices, in which case none of the usual economic models apply. 

The vast majority of cyber crime is fraud. The criminals don't hack the bank directly; rather they hack the customers of the bank and commit fraudulent transactions. I strongly doubt there is active collaboration. Some criminals may have insider contacts, but that's different to a symbiotic relationship. There may be an effect somewhat like you mention. Increasing security is expensive for banks, so it is only worth doing if they are experiencing a certain level of losses. In theory it would make sense for criminals to restrict their level of activity, to avoid banks implementing additional security, which would make their job harder. In practice I don't think this happens, because their are multiple cyber gangs and I strongly doubt there is a gentleman's code between then. It is theoretically possible for someone to hack the bank itself, and directly modify balances - effectively creating money out of thin air. In fact, it is thought that some major nation states (mostly US and China) have penetrated many banks around the word. However, if they started to extract money, this is likely to be noticed, due to internal checks and balances. It is more valuable for these state-sponsored actors to silently remain present, capturing information. And one day, perhaps they will strike, as part of a larger war strategy.
