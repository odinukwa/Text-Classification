Another example: there are 3x3 matrices which, when applied to a vector representing a pythagorean triple, produce other pythagorean triples. I think it is even a way to produce all primitive pythagorean triples from (3,4,5). In general, you are looking for a finite number of operations which produce through composition a number of objects, and it seems that you want no overlap, i.e. if h and k are two composition series for which h(obj)=k(obj) for some initial object obj, then h=k as composition series, or in other words they are built up the same way. Universal algebra has some means for the study of the generation of objects through operation composition. In particular, the operations form a clone (semigroup if you look at just the operations which take one argument) which, given the uniqueness requirement above, is relatively free on the set of generators, as there will be no nontrivial equations satisfied by the compostions. There are other areas and examples as well, but until the question becomes more specific, I will stop here. Gerhard "Ask Me About System Design" Paseman, 2010.06.08 

Towards a weak proof of existence, I would go through Gordon Royle's database of Sudoku with a minimum number of givens, and (program a computer to) check for multiple rational solutions on any of the puzzles. If all of them had unique rational solutions, I would take that as strong evidence that all proper Sudoku have unique rational solutions. If one had multiple rational solutions, add some givens until you have a maximal desired puzzle, and publish it (or send it to Nick Baxter et. al. for the sociological answer).

If this forum were a mathematical discussion forum, your question would be welcome, encouraged, and anticipated. I would be happy to provide input from a public citizen point of view. This forum is meant more for answers, references, and perhaps derived questions. While I hope you get some appropriate input from here, I instead encourage setting up a wiki or participating in a forum like publishing.mathforge.org, which has been discussing related issues for a while. I believe (after gathering a few search terms from suggestions about to appear) that you will find a lot of the discussion extant on various weblogs and related fora, and that you will see a number of issues to be avoided at some cost. As with most community efforts, you will find the greatest success coming from a dedicated subcommunity which understands and represents the core values of the effort. Assemble that, and much of the rest will follow. It is my hope that what you propose will permit and benefit from contributions from the interested public.

V. Murskii showed that the equational theory of this algebra has no logically equivalent (in equational logic) finite theory. Lyndon earlier showed that every two element algebra with one binary operation did have a finite basis, and Perkins found a six element semigroup with no finite basis. I don't know the status of algebras with a single ternary operation. Gerhard "Ask Me About System Design" Paseman, 2010.06.21 

Unless I am missing something, the game will always end in a loss for both players. In the case n=2, the second player plays on the same diagonal as the first player. For larger n, the penultimate move of player 2 is to block the unique winning move determined by player 1's first (n-1) moves. Player 1's last move would then be to block player 2's winning move, if one exists. This is based on my reading of the rules, which tells me that every configuration of n+1 marks of one player loses, that marks are not overwritten or replaced once made, and that each players places only one mark during their turn.

To answer the question briefly: if you didn't find a guide or enough examples of a good practice online, then it is underpromoted (which includes the possibility that it doesn't exist). People are still working on ways to cite online material, especially when referring to evolving resources like MathOverflow. If you can provide enough reference points in the bibliography to ensure that anyone who checks will find that to which you refer, then you have done your part of the job. MathOverflow assists in this by providing static unmodifiable data (question number, user number, timestamp of revision, etc.) as well as a link that gives you the data in a format suitable for bibliographic reference, but that is no guarantee that things won't change after some transition. If OEIS had made some suggestion for reference which you still find wanting, I offer two: For the short term (while you are still active), prepare an electronic file which contains additional research notes for limited distribution. This can include your favorite online resource links or even gossip about which reference librarians to ask, but one thing it can include is a jpeg which is a screen snapshot of the OEIS page as it looked when you retrieved it. That way, for any future researcher who can't verify that part of your work and asks something like "What choo talking about Willis?", you can send them jpeg as supporting material. Hopefully they will still have a jpeg reader in that decade. For the rest of posterity, also include links to other papers which use the sequence. Future historians can then infer the existence of a great and powerful database, something like a lost continent, which was gifted to mankind for the purpose of furthering intellectual acheivements, and which may inspire them to reconstruct it from whatever digital archives the insect rulers left to them.

Here is a simple approach. The left hand side (for fixed $m$) is always at most $2^m$, so when is the right hand side bigger than $2^m$? Rewriting $k = \frac{m}{d},$ this is the same as asking for which $k$ is $ek > 2^k$? By inspection or calculus, one has it true for $1 \leq k \leq 3$, so when $d$ is between $m/3$ and $m$, the inequality holds. For $d \lt m/3$, the right hand side (by Stirling) is larger than $\sqrt{2\pi d}\binom{m}{d}$, which in turn is larger than twice the largest summand on the left hand side. As has been noted elsewhere, this is an upper bound for the sum when $3d \leq m, $ showing the inequality holds for small $d$. Gerhard "Ask Me About Rough Estimates" Paseman, 2013.05.17 

If you don't mind working in equational logic (no relation symbols besides equality, and focusing only on universally quantified equations), then there are many examples in universal algebra. Groups have axiomatizations with and without a symbol for inverse, and even within the same language there is interest in alternative axiomatizations for the same theory, e.g. Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras, lattices. If you want logics with more expressive power, you may consider interpretability results as well, which are ways of "encoding" one theory into another. I only know of applications of this to show undecidability of theories, but there is a study of other objects around the notion of interpretability that Ralph McKenzie and others have created/discovered.

Let a,b,c satisfy the restrictions given, as well as $1 + a + b + c $ is a multiple of $3$. Then $83449 + a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ is also a multiple of 3, and then $d$ can be chosen to be $1/3$ of the last quantity. Gerhard "3D Makes It So Easy" Paseman, 2013.05.21 

Here's a (highly nonoriginal) method: overlay a finite hyperplane grid onto the region of interest. For R^2 this divides the plane into rectangles, for R^3 into cuboids (a.k.a rectangular parallelipipeds), and into higher dimensional intervals for the space of your choice. Now, mark all those bounded grid areas which lie fully inside your region; if you have some space left over not inside a marked area, add finitely many more hyperplanes to your grid, and repeat. Doing this countably many times will get you within epsilon in measure to your region. I leave the formalizing of the algorithm to you. Oops, in using the word measure I gave it away. Cf. Lesbesgue or Riemann for technical details. Gerhard "Ask Me About System Design" Paseman, 2010.02.17
