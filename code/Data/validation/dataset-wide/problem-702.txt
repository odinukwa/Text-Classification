In your case, you'd have to do a lot more work to get the bar ends on, unless you can find a set with a clamp that's hinged and opens up completely. 

Riding here (Vancouver, Canada) in the city is quite different from what you're talking about (i.e. no highways and "high-traffic roads" would be the main arterial streets), but I still thought I'd chime in... Personally, I avoid heavy traffic whenever possible. I don't consider the amount of time I'd would save by riding on a major street to be worth the risk. I find it much more pleasant to ride on a quiet side-street than a busy road. There's probably more risk of a car blasting through an intersection on an side street, but on the other hand I can hear them coming. 

We drop our kid at school in the mornings, and I'd like to bike over to pick her up after school. I've picked her up on our tandem (that's one reason I got the tandem), but she'd like to ride her own bike some of the time. So I need a way to take her bike with me, something like this, I guess: 

This works well enough for my purposes, but it's not perfect. Because it's the wheel of the kids bike that's strapped to the rack, there is some freedom for the rear of the kids bike to move up and down, which is good. But because the bike is tipped up and off-center, interesting things happen going around corners. Turning to the left, no problem. Turning to the right... the rear wheel of the kids bike "flops" to the right and ends up about a foot off-center to the right. It comes back inline with the towing bike when you straighten up, but you have to have the cranks in the position shown so they don't come close to the wheel of the tow bike. Another issue that came up after I actually tried it with my kid on the back of the tandem is that the kids bike has to be attached as far back as possible on the rack to give enough clearance for the stoker's heel. 

I learned a lot about racing when I had a roommate who was on a local team and raced full-time for a couple years (and then part-time since.) You probably don't want to take on a roomie just to learn about racing, but you might be able to volunteer to help out a local team. I also learned a lot reading my roommate's Velo News magazines. I don't know if it's the same now, at the time it was a magazine for serious racers, not at all like the glossy newsstand magazines. 

Depends on what you want to use it for and how much you like working on bikes yourself. No obvious branding may or may not be a problem - you might have a POS made with cheap, heavy steel and knock-off components, or a perfectly good name-brand bike with good components. If you're not sure of the difference, you should ask a bike shop or someone who knows bikes. In my experience, a good quality bike is pretty robust: my two bikes are 20 and 25 years old and are going strong and have never needed more than minimal maintenance. I've got a couple other bikes that are the same age that I'll get around to fixing up some day and I don't expect any problems with them. OTOH, a cheap POS bike is often a pain to maintain - there are usually lots of rusty "stainless" fasteners, everything's sloppier, etc. If the bike's in decent shape, it could still be ok, but long-term use is more of a problem. Either way, the things to look at are: First - frame damage: are there dents, rust or buckled tubes? If the bike has had a head-on collision, you may see a frame buckle near the head tube. Is the derailleur straight or is it or the hanger bent? Next, is the bike is in good riding condition? Is the drivetrain is smooth, do the gears shift crisply, is the braking smooth and effective? Look at the cogs and chainrings for worn (pointed) teeth, look at the braking surface on the rims: do they look worn? If the bike is mostly ok, lube it up and change the cables (or get a shop to do it), but if it is just a cheap "department store" bike, I wouldn't plan on doing much more than that. If it's a decent bike with good components and it's working well now, I'd expect it to give you many years of good service. 

One of our bikes is an electric bike. It's an older iZip HG 1000, and although we got it through the American "manufacturer" (Currie Technologies), like most of the low-end ebikes it's made in China of heavy steel and uses cheap, cheap, cheap components. The rear brake is called a belt brake or band brake. When I was researching this a bit, I came across a discussion that said this type of brake is something like 20 cents cheaper than V-Brakes to manufacture in bulk, which is why it shows up on this type of bike. Here's a couple pics: just the brake and then one mounted on a bike (not our bike): 

The bike doesn't actually stick out beyond the width of the car as much as it appears to in the picture, it's less than a foot on each side. It does stick way way up above the car, however, so when I've done this (only a couple times) I'm very careful about going into underground parking. 

It's necessary to bungee-cord the bike or otherwise secure it otherwise it'll tend to slide "down" (in my case, the front will tip down, which will make it stick out on the driver's side). I use 2 cords to secure it: 

I would sometimes like to transport my tandem by car, and it would be convenient to use one of those "strap-on" bumper carriers. Is it feasible to use this type of carrier? 

Safety Glasses. I no longer bother with prescription sunglasses, I have multiple pairs of Uvex safety glasses that fit nicely over my glasses. There are multiple lenses that filter all UV, come in different colours, etc. I also have a pair with clear lenses that I use when it's particularly dusty or dirty. (e.g. I sometimes ride over a very busy bridge) If you do go with some sort of safety glasses, you can either find someplace online that sells them or look for a local safety/industrial supply company. Here's some more Uvex-specific information, I'm sure other brands would also work: The glasses I use are the Uvex Genesis with Espresso Lenses. The Gold Mirror lens looks cooler (both are 100% UV) but the gold surface finish is more fragile. The lenses on these and many other safety glasses are interchangeable so if you want another colour or need a replacement, you don't need to buy the frame. OTOH, the frames are not expensive so it's possible to have multiple shades for different conditions. (The last pair I bought last year was about Can$35.) Uvex has a smaller series called the Genesis Slim that might meet your need for a smaller pair of glasses. They don't have as many colour choices for lenses, but both of the "Grey" choices block 100% of UV. This page has PDFs of reference info: which tints are available for which frames, details of the different lens tints. 

i.e. like the ones in the top left of the picture. Do they have the little ball bearing in the middle? 

In addition to velcro and clips, you can use "slap bracelets." Badge holder lanyards from conventions work well, too (but only the ones with alligator clips). Wrap it once around, put the clip end through the closed end and pull it tight. The clip will hold it tight. (pics later) 

A possibility not already mentioned is a broken axle: I had the axle on my 25-year-old mountain bike break while riding and although I noticed the tire was wobbling, it wasn't until I got to my destination that I realized what had happened. The axle had snapped in the middle (inside the hub), but the bearings stayed in place becuse the seat and chainstays were essentially applying compression force to the axle. I'm sure the inside of the hub was damaged from the broken ends rubbing but I've never looked to be sure. 

The top of the kids bike wheel is strapped to the rack, and the front of the wheel is strapped to the frame of the towing bike. You can't see it clearly in the pictures, but the fork of the kids bike sits against the rear stay of the rack, so pulling the front of the wheel into the frame of the tow bike keeps the wheel away from the wheel of the towing bike. Another variation that worked quite well has been to use a metal hook (similar to this, but one side is large enough to fit the wheel) to hang the wheel of the kids bike from the rack, then a couple bungee cords to hold it tight. Closer view: 

The front bottom bracket is mounted off-centre in an aluminum shell called "the eccentric." When the pinch bolts shown in the picture are loosened, the eccentric can rotate within the bottom bracket shell to tighten or loosen the tandem's timing chain (that joins the front and rear cranks). If the pinch bolts broke, or if the braze-ons they fit into sheered off, would the bottom bracket shell pop open? It seems to me that the integrity of the bottom bracket shell is totally dependent on the bolts; that you'd bend the frame quite badly if they broke. 

Actually, now that I look closely at the pictures, I can see part of why it's cheap - no special frame fittings needed. The donut-shaped "drum" mounts to the hub, the other piece just fits over that drum and is clamped to the seat stay. My problem is that the thing squeals like a banshee. There's no pad adjustment as there would be for cantilevers, the only adjustment is how tight the belt starts. If I loosen it enough to stop the squealing, there's not enough pull to actually stop the bike. Is there any adjustment I could do to get rid of the squealing? 

I don't have any chain oil right now, but I have some gear oil left over from working on my car. Would it be an effective chain lubricant? It's listed as 80W90, but reading the Wikipedia article suggests that that's not equivalent to motor oil viscosity ratings. 

The ones I've got are bent a bit more, closer to 90 degrees. I've mounted them sticking straight up, which gives me a hand position pretty much parallel to my bars, but a few inches higher. The only picture I've got right now isn't very clear, but you can sort-of see how the bar ends are positioned: 

Maybe this should be a comment to WTHarper's answer, but creaks when pedaling can also be fasteners that are failing. I have an electric bike that has two chains and an intermediate axle - a chain goes from the cranks to the intermediate, then another from the intermediate to the freewheel. I started hearing creaking noises when pedaling hard, but didn't get a chance to look into it until the 4 bolts holding a cog on the intermediate had sheared off. 

My main bike (a tandem) is a bit small, and I need to get a taller stem, but in the meantime, I'm using some bar ends similar to this: 

Yes, yes it is possible... If the tandem is loaded onto the carrier at an angle, it won't extend much beyond the width of the car or minivan (maybe not at all for a larger vehicle). It's not totally clear in the following picture, but the horizontal bars are tilted up a bit to make it more secure. 

I use the colourless, odorless liquid that comes out of taps and sometimes (often, where I am) falls from the sky... Beyond simply using a damp cloth, when I'm doing maintenance, I'll wipe off any grease or oil using WD-40 or Liquid Wrench or Brake Clean (whatever I have on hand for cleaning bolts). We don't have that brand of dish soap here, but I wouldn't hesitate to use something like that on a bike. For people who are worried about harsh soaps, there's Palmolive, which is well-known for being very gentle. 

...except I don't need to be able to support the weight of the kid on the bike, I only need to be able to tow a riderless bike. So I'm trying to find a way to do the same thing that's cheaper (hopefully) and lighter (and maybe smaller?). One possibility (that I'll try) is to simply strap her bike to the back of the tandem. I'm sure that will work, but I'd also like a system that works if my wife is the also riding the tandem and a system that would on a single bike. 

I still need to play with it a bit, but I'm currently doing pretty much what heltonbiker suggested - bungee-ing the wheel of the kids bike to the rear rack:
