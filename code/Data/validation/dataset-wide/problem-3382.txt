If linguistic rules which describe the derivation of surface forms from underlying ones, are meant to account for both production and perception, then it seems that intermediary forms like the two posited below must be reconsidered. How should one best eliminate them, if at all? /maNioN/ --> [mãn.i.õn] --> [mã.ni.õn] --> [mã.nyõ?] 

How did Goldsmith account for the OCP using Autosegmental Phonology? I suppose he couldn't accept it because 

Can I say that Type 1 and Type 2 are "NP elipsis" and Type 3 is AdjP elipsis (even if it wasn't the NP/AdjP that was elided?) Or is there a better way? 

If we compare two unrelated languages with lexical tone, where both languages have the same number of tonal contrasts, are there any universals/tendencies regarding: 

I understand that it is a prosodic word that dominates feet in a classic hierarchy -- but why do we need to refer to a prosodic word rather than just a word? I know they are different units, but what's the evidence that the "prosodic word" is something different than what we think of as a "word" (at least in European languages)? 

What were the explanatory shortcomings in Autosegmental Phonology which motivated McCarthy to re-introduce the segment as a unit of representation in CV Phonology? 

Each is not a 'floating quantifier' here (whatever that means), and each does not modify boys. The reciprocal meaning is expressed by each in combination with other, and although each other is written as two orthographic words it is actually a single grammatical word. The two components are inseparable and thus form a compound reciprocal pronoun. In your example, the compound functions as direct object of hit. You may be thinking of the 'spilt' construction as in 

which is semantically and syntactically different. Here "each" is a determinative and "other" a common noun, as opposed to a single compound pronoun. 

I very much dislike the term "adverbial". I think it is very unsatisfactory to have a function term that is morphologically derived from a category term. Adverb is a word category, and adverb phrase (a phrase headed by an adverb) the corresponding phrase category. Adverbial is a function and may be realised by an AdvP (He spoke quickly), a PP (He spoke with enthusiasm), an NP (He’s speaking this evening). AdvPs do not always function as adverbials: they may function as modifier in AdjPs (It was quite amazingly expensive), etc. Adverbial phrase is quite often used for any phrase functioning as adverbial and hence likely to be confused with adverb phrase. This confusion is overcome by the use of the term "adjunct" as an alternative to "adverbial". 

In the short article on this webpage, the author provides an explanation of nasal variation in Spanish which makes use of an archiphoneme /N/. I put the relevant excerpt below. My question about this is relatively simple: Is it terminologically correct to consider the [m n ɲ] as as allophones of /N/? 

OT offers a tool to see how a surface structure is derived from an underlying one. Autosegmental phonology also allows us to see how a surface form can be derived from an underlying representation. Is this comparison accurate? I'm afraid not because many rules of OT are based in autosegmental theory. Can someone help me sort out how I should consider these two "things" (tools?)? Thanks a lot. 

This is a popular image floating around the internet, but like many things floating there, it seems like a gross simplification and just plain inaccurate. However, I’m more of an armchair linguist than a bonafide linguist like most of you guys. To what extent is this accurate, would you use it as a heuristic for undergrads? For ex.: It seems strange to distinguish between “literal meaning” (do linguists even believe in literal meaning?!) as an object of study itself? Also, the first four circles suggest a “is made up of” relation: “phrases are made up of words are made up of phonemes...) but that doesn’t work for the outermost two. Etc etc. but maybe this is still a useful tool to understanding units and subdisciplines in the field. What’s your take? 

These are the diagrams for your three sentences. Note the cross-referencing symbols i and j for the prenucleus items in the last tree. 

I'd say that the adjunct "before this time" belongs not in the matrix clause, but in the catenative complement clause, as shown in this tree: 

Phrasal Verbs: First, I’d advise you to drop the term 'phrasal verb'. It’s thoroughly misleading. It’s not the whole expression "call for" that is a verb; it’s just the lexeme "call". Your example, This calls for a thorough examination of the facts is analysed as verb - [prep + O]. It’s a verbal idiom headed by the prepositional verb “call”, where the preposition “for” is specified by the verb. Particles are intransitive prepositions (plus a few adjectives and verbs) which can freely come between a transitive verb and its direct object. The distinctive property of particles is that they can precede the object but in general they don’t have to, so there is alternation between, say, Ed took off his coat and Ed took his coat off. Now compare that pair with your example This calls for an examination” ~ * This calls an examination for. Clearly "for" is not a particle on two counts: in that example, "for" is a transitive preposition and "call" is an intransitive verb. Complements vs adjuncts: Complements in NP structure are virtually restricted to PPs (usually headed by "of") and subordinate clauses. In your example, the PP "of the facts" is complement of the noun "examination". In NPs, dependents with the form of PPs qualify as complements when they are licensed by the particular head noun. In your example, the PP "of the facts" is licensed by "examination". The clearest of cases have one or more of these properties: (1) The PP corresponds to object or subject NPs, compare the facts examined ~ the examination of the facts. (2) The choice of preposition is specified by the head noun, as is the case with your example "call for a thorough examination", where "call" specifies "for". (3) the PP is obligatory because the noun makes little sense without it: "the advent of the steam engine", "the feasibility of the proposal", "a dearth of new ideas" and so on. Complements are a kind of dependent that must be licensed by the head of the phrase. By contrast, adjuncts require no such licensing; they function as modifiers in clause structure, or as supplements. Obligatory elements are always complements: they are needed to complete the verb phrase; optional elements may be either complements or adjuncts. Matthews in The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics defines complement as “A syntactic element seen as completing the construction of another element”: the syntactic concept construction is preferable to the semantic concept meaning. He goes on to say, more specifically, that it applies to elements which are within the valency of a verb or other lexical unit. And his entry for "valency" is: “The range of syntactic elements either required or specifically permitted by a verb or other lexical unit"– which is equivalent to licensing. 

As a linguist, I have a good idea of what linguistic properties of a sound can be: be they describable in terms of distinctive features or whatever. But what, then, are spectral properties? It's not clear to me if they are distinct from or partially overlapping with linguistic properties. 

In reading about Clements' structural representation of features, the phonetic contents of a segment are organised into feature tiers and 5 class tiers (root, lar, supralar, place, manner). 

I don't see why not, but as for interspecies communication, the string-music language makes the assumption that the auditory perception of the different species is similar enough that the sounds can be perceived in a comparable way. Perhaps the acoustic vibrations are perceived haptically by one species and auditorily by another. That would certainly be interesting. 

It'd be awesome if there was an image or images like this that included both place and manner, but maybe it'd be too complicated. Any input/advice on this would be appreciated! 

Well, the sentence must be made up of something, if not words. Another unit could be syllables. Usually syllables form words, but not necessarily. One could imagine a "sentence" comprised of non-word syllables, the meaning of which is constructed through specific intonation contours imposed on the syllables. 

Briefly, Huddleston & Pullum in CGEL pp. 257-8, note that there is a structural similarity between the predicative complement in [1] and the locative complement in [2], which suggests that assigning a location to something is comparable to assigning it a property. They argue that one respect in which locative complements resemble predicatives is that they too are oriented towards either the subject in intransitives (The letter is on the table), or the object in transitives, as in [2]. They go on to say that, however, since there are numerous verbs which only take one or the other (PC or locative), they do not assimilate the locatives to the predicatives, but regard them as syntactically distinct kinds of complements that exhibit certain semantic resemblances. 

Leaving aside "interjections", we recognise eight (8) word categories (parts of speech). Six (6) of them can function as the head of corresponding phrases: the other two can’t. The very small coordinator and subordinator classes do not function as head but serve as markers of coordination and subordination: there is no such thing as 'coordinator phrases' or 'subordinator phrases'. [1] Noun (NP) “this clear case of dedication to duty” [2] Verb (VP) “saw something in there” [3] Adjective (AdjP) “very eager for further news” [4] Determinative (DP) “almost every” [5] Adverb (AdvP) “quite separately from this issue” [6] Preposition (PP) “right out of the area” [7] Coordinator (no phrasal category) [8] Subordinator (no phrasal category) Note: pronouns are not treated as a distinct part of speech, but as a subclass of noun. 

Seems some linguists use "naturalistic" -- but I'm not clear on what it means in this context or if it's different from "natural". 

They also provide a symbolic representation of a hypothetical gestural score for the world "palm", where 

The link at the end takes the reader to a webpage without much description of what hmm-synthesis is. But maybe those of you more familiar with speech synthesis have some insight. Is hmm-synthesis Concatenative synthesis, Formant synthesis, or something else altogether? I am boggled so any help would be great. Just want to get an idea of the kinds of speech synthesis so I understand better the overall strategies for synthesis speech generation. Thanks! 

Conceptually, I understand the difference between underlying (?phonological), surface (?phonetic) and lexical (?) "levels", but what are these levels? I think they are just a heuristic, a sort of scientific shortcut on which all linguists agree, because they have explanatory value... but I'd like your expert input. 

I understand that phonetic analysis can be performed in various domains, among which: time, frequency, cepstral, and spectral. In the time domain, one studies e.g. Rate, energy, and duration. In the frequency domain one studies e.g. f0. This makes logical sense -- but how am I to conceive of these two domains as being independent of one another? I'm looking for more than a mathematical explanation (such as the one that rightly distinguishes cepstral from spectral) - but rather an intellectual framing to scaffold my interpretation of "domain". Thanks! 

For locatives, the basic suffix is –de/da (otelde, okulda) but after an unvoiced consonant (ç, f, h, k, p, s, ş or t) the suffix appears as –te/ta (otobüste, maçta). Now for the vowel harmony. a is followed by a or ı e is followed by e or i ı is followed by ı or a i is followed by i or e o is followed by a or u ö is followed by ü or e u is followed by u or a ü is followed by ü or e It will all become second nature once you practice it repeatedly. 

Transitive clauses, the kind with a transitive verb and a direct object, can sometimes contain a further constituent called an objective predicative complement that refers to the direct object. It is typically an adjective phrase, as in your example, but it can also be a noun phrase. The objective PC occurs after the direct object, not before it. Reversing the order either changes the meaning, or yields an ungrammatical sentence: [1a] We painted the fence blue. [1b] We painted the blue fence. [2a] She made him a good husband. [2b] * She made a good husband him. In these pairs, [1a] tells us that we painted the fence, and we painted it a blue colour. But [1b] has a different meaning; it tells us we painted the blue fence, but it does not tell us what colour we painted it – perhaps we painted it green or white, who knows? In [2a] we understand that her efforts resulted in him being a good husband, but [2b] where the predicative precedes the object is ungrammatical.
