To give a parallel, Descartes and Locke take opposite views in epistemology, but it does not mean they have nothing in common. Both write as Christians. Both try to solve problems of perception. Both reject certain features of the classic medieval philosophies while implicitly accepting others. 

To get to A -> C we can again: (A) assume the left side and CP (B) negate the entire expression and RAA In this case, it's a lot easier to negate -- since we can use addition to show that the negation we make is invalid: 

The notion of an absolutely immovable physical object is logically incoherent. Here, the argument would be that to be a physical object is to be the sort of thing subject to physical forces and that being so would mean there's some amount of mass or hardness or other feature that the object has. By definition, anything that could exceed that could move or alter the object. Ergo, the concept of an object that is unliftable would be self-contradictory (See SEP "Omnipotence") (This seems to be the view of Thomas Aquinas). That any limitation on God is a form of self-restraint rather than fundamental limitation. In other words, God can create an object God says God cannot move, and God won't move it -- but not because it is immovable per se but instead immovable per volens. (People that take this view and think there's a God would be committed to a form of voluntarism). That God can impose self limitations that stand permanently. In other words, God can make a rock God cannot lift. Again, the origin wouldn't be that the rock has infinite mass but that God can manufacture the rock and bind a condition on God's own self to not be able to pick up the rock. 

Turtles my dear boy, turtles. This concern has been around since before the modern computer. Rene Desecrate contested a similar concern in his Meditations, though for him the illusion was made by a mischievous demon. We have also seen portrayals of this in "The Matrix". Unfortunately, the logical necessity for a Primary World cannot quite overcome the existence of an infinite regression. Much like aligning two mirrors towards each other, the image appears in an infinite regression. This is the plot of ##Spoiler Alert## "The Thirteenth Floor". Another example that may put the concept into perspective is the old problem in cosmology posed by the "unmoved mover" paradox. As phased jokingly by Steven Hawkins; 

Since this is a modern trend being widely implemented, it is a suitable answer - and the end to many people's investigations. It was my experience that strictly studying business as a practical subject was limited to strictly finding a solution to a problem and never discussing the deeper implications of those decisions. However, in studying philosophy I delved into other facets of the questions; i.e. "If outsourcing will eventually raise the cost of labor in a country, is this a sustainable practice?", "Is exporting labor exploitive?", and "What role does a business play in the community that sustains it?". Many of these questions fell outside of the scope of a business study, but integrally informative in practical business. 

I don't have much of a personal opinion on this question, but this is an issue that Descartes addresses. It's central to his proof for the existence of God. According to Descartes in the Meditations (specifically Med. 2 or 3), you can only imagine (i.e., for an image or phantasm [which is part of the Aristotelian model]) based on what you have already experienced. So, for Descartes, to imagine a six-toed wolf involves taking your imagination of a dog or a wolf and its toes and adding an extra one. Or to imagine a flying cat, you mix your images of cats with images you already have of flying animals (or airplanes). This matters for his proof of God's existence, because he does not think the idea of perfection could come from him or from anything less than perfect, ergo something outside of himself that is perfect exists. I would guess you're looking post-Kant or so to get to the point where people will take the opposite view that we can engage in genuinely novel imaginings. 

The point of both of these thoughts is that the truth is sacrosanct. Inherent in this argument is a refutation of the validity of a "post-truth" concept. Rhetoric has existed throughout history - it is acknowledged in both ancient statements - but the impact of rhetoric will often result in its own self destruction. That destruction resolves in an appeal to reason and truth foundational to discourse and discovery. A point that precipitated the OP I cited above: 

The basic premise of "1" is understood, and transcends specific semiotics. If you can differentiate one thing from another to any degree, then you can grasp the basic premise of numerals, and therefore mathematics. 

Therefore, there are no human rights, only human obligations to do no harm, unless forced to. And from that obligation we can derive social contracts that dictate further artificial laws to enhance humanity. However, categorically these are not inherent natural rights. 

Unfortunately, there's a problem with your example. Aristotle does not think artifacts (here meaning objects that people make) are hylomorphic substances. For Aristotle, the most central examples are living things (but there are others). So for instance, a tree is something that is following the tree-pattern (or form or essence) and that is organizing lots of matter towards that pattern -- turning it into root, branch, leaf, fruit, etc. Or a giraffe. It's eating stuff and turning that stuff (the hyle) into giraffy-organized stuff. Transferred to your artifact example, you're right that the car shape is the "form" of it and that the clay is working as the "matter." But ... 

Either the self is or is not deceived. If the self is not deceived, then the self's perception that the self exists is veridical. If the self is deceived, then there must be an existing self to be deceived. Ergo, either the self is correct to believe it exists or the self exists because it is deceived. 

Perhaps this is an irreverent answer but I believe the phrase "je ne sais quoi" encapsulates what you are asking. 

There are several good answers in the other post, and rather than rewriting the whole thing, I am just going to point to that. 

Thomas Jefferson disagrees with the OP criticism; "the notion of human rights is imaginary and reducible to absurdity (that humans by virtue of being born are magically entitled to certain things)... [and] that human rights are a human invention" Jefferson argues in the Declaration of Independence, that human rights are unalienable which is understood a priori by all individuals in society. 

Marx statement "that religion is the opiate of the masses" is a statement about religion itself. Look into Emile Durkheim's 1921 book, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, for more related information about religion and it's power to influencing the masses. Marx's conflict theory incorporates a similar understanding, but also adds context based on the conflict of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. With this additional context he argues that religion is a pacifier to the proletariat struggle. It masks the struggle of man within the world of man, and instead proposes man's struggle be focused on the salvation in the next life. Leading a religious person to believe their struggle is for religious Glory, and not here on this earth. There is a willing compliance with those who commit to religion. This is of course an oversimplification of the many factor at play when we consider volition and religious devotion. It should also be noted that this is a rather extreme view and does not account for those of "true faith". Those who have devotion without the necessity of escaping social oppression. It also does not acknowledge that religious contentment can be legitimate contentment, a reversal of Marx's original proposition. We can reconcile this because Marx's primary focus is on the collective social need to lift up the entire proletariat population, and end the social exploitations found the world over. You also asked if religion is administered by the bourgeoisie. The answer is no, in the sense that they are not the actors solely responsible for the introduction of religion in society. However, as with all exploitable social mechanisms (labor trade, goods trade, access to the means of production, etc.), the bourgeoisie do make use of religion. Looking at the close relationship that religion and civil leadership share throughout history. A relationship so typical that it had to be directly abolished in the United States Constitution, a clear affirmation of the bourgeoisie's use and abuse through the influence of religion. The bourgeoisie's use of religion is more to further their power and fortify the division of the classes. Bare in mind that the bourgeoisie's greatest tools are not the ones they create themselves, but the ones that exist naturally and offer an opportunity to control. With the exceptions of social services, the bourgeoisie do not create much. That is the foundational accusation condemning classism in Marxist Conflict Theory. 

Kant actually has such a feature in his moral system: it's called imperfect duty. Kant specifies two: Your Own improvement and Helping Others. In both cases, the means of fulfillment are not specified but that you have a duty to help others is specified. Similarly, you as a rational being in need of the developed aid of others have an obligation to improve your abilities. But this does not decided which abilities you must improve. There may be one inadequacy to what you are looking for insofar as the obligation is not attached to a specific person. 

Similar conundrums arise if we try to look at virtue theory as a consequentialist theory. Looking just at Aristotle's account, Nicomachean Ethics BK I Chapter 7 identifies what we are trying to maximize as our human function (i.e. our humanity). As the subsequent parts demonstrate, the way we do this is by applying practical wisdom to certain emotional and rational states and finding the balance that matches (a) our species, (b) our specific abilities (if I'm say genetically predisposed to being strong or weepy), (c) the precise circumstance, and (d) my growth vis-a-vis (a) and (b) through my choices of action. And then we have to look at the natural unit of human beings as being not the individual but the polis. The root problem here is similar but not identical to the Kantian case. The similarity is its difficult to calculate this. But Aristotle is going to give different reasons: (1) those of us who lack phronesis won't know the optimal conditions and behaviors, (2) phronesis can include situational factors in a way that makes it so it's not always clear there is one action that should be taken. (3) Since virtue is about seeking means, these means will be such that an action that was virtuous (or at least virtue-forming for one individual) is now vicious for the same individual. 

I would consider this very closely aligned with Martin Heidegger's theory posed in "Being and Time". "She never achieved her authentic self; Dasein." 

I believe that the author's intent is that the practice of aesthetics -appreciation of true beauty - is itself unselfish - neither the beautiful thing, nor the actor, is unselfish. It is more descriptive of the person's experiencing the beauty (in that moment), rather than the beautiful thing in-itself. 

I think this is a strict programming scenario where "True" is treated as a variable, and not in any philosophical way. For example in VBA "True" is equivalent to -1, while False is equivalent to 0. Other programming languages define "True" as 1. If that is the case with Python, it follows that 1 + 1 > 1. In Philosophy, True + True = True because Truth is not a divisible value. 

Now that being said, this is as much a convenient falsehood as Descartes "radical skepticism" and "brain in a vat." In other words, it's not even clear if there's anyone who ever held the view in the easily pilloried form. Presumably, when you say you're a bit of an "empiricist" what you mean is something more to the effect that you think knowledge comes from the senses. Or perhaps, you use it as a shorthand denial of Platonic forms and the like. The idea that our knowledge comes from the senses has a diverse following that includes both Aristotle, Locke, Mill, Quine, Searle, and others. (Note here that there's no "only" -- as many (all?) of these views think there's some processing and other things that are involved in knowledge). See also $URL$ 

Starting from 6d-e, the argument is framed by Euthyphro's claim that what unifies the things we call holy (despite their differences) is 

I believe Wittgenstein is arguing that for Logical Positivists the meaning of anything is accessed through life - therefore they define Life as the pursuit of the meaning of things. A simple representation of this definition is, Life = meaning of "x". 

While the dualist and materialist do not agree on the origins of the mind, I believe that both hold agree that it is the existence of a mind that establishes personhood. Descarte described an animal brain as a clockwork mechanism devoid of a mind. Therefore, the sheep's brain in a human's body is an animal. In the reversal, where a human brain in transplanted into a sheep, personhood could perhaps be transferred too. For a Dualists it would depend on if the mind is also transferred. For the Materialist, the mind necessarily transfers where the brain goes (if the brain maintains its functionality). This is also true for a literal "brain in the vat" scenario. However, to ask if the mind could be "downloaded" into a computer, rather than transferring the brain to a vat frames the question slightly differently. It poses little issue to the dualist, since the mind is separate from the brain, and the computer would simply replace the mechanical portion of the current role of the brain. However, to a materialist, each mind is the result of a specific brain, therefore begs the question of how the same mind could exist outside the specific brain of its origins.
