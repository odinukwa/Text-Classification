A Special Set of Circumstances Required for a Civilization to Be Lost With the exception of Thera, an unrecoverable set-back for a society does not require many (or any) casualties. In the case of Egypt, the empire had been under generations of pressure to westernize by it's own government prior to Roman annexation. Similarly, Babylon had been under eight years of pressure to westernize under Alexander, which continued under his heirs. And although experts disagree on the specifics, they seems to all agree that there was a widespread loss of faith in everything Mayan when their culture and written language was largely abandoned. But pressure to abandon culture does not seem to be enough. Israel has been disbanded as a civilization at least five times. They had their writings taken from them, their young indoctrinated in foreign cultures, families split up, and were enslaved. Nevertheless, a group of people within that culture saw it worth while to keep the language (written and spoken) alive. They kept their stories alive. They even wrote texts (the Talmud) expounding and studying their culture, and teaching it to their children (if they were kept together) and neighbors. Their period is Babylon marked the language strongly, but people remained faithful in keeping literate in their old writings and put effort, even at risk of prejudice and imprisonment to maintain and continue developing their culture. By contrast the Mayan culture seems to have been a widespread and spontaneous choice to opt-out. How To Create a Long Lasting Apocalypse Given the historical examples, there seems to be a recipe to creating a collapse. 

For the thing to work, it must be true that n >= I N. You can set n = I N, and solve for the variables you like. 

Keeping in mind that IQ is the ratio of intellectual age to physical age will, I think, help you with this. There are a few existing relationships within that range you can examine for your aliens: parents compared to their children, professionals in high-IQ professions (medicine, law) compared to lay persons, people to their pets (a 2009 study showed that smart dogs have, depending on the subject area, the same capability as 2, 3, or 4 year old humans) There is an idea of a "communication gap" past about 30 points of IQ, and that seems reflected in some of these relationships - kids don't understand when adults are talking about 'adult' topics, and some times there are Easter eggs in kids movies for the grown ups that go completely over the heads of the kids. Parents may read books about how to interact with their children, and High IQ professions take classes in communication and technical writing - training to communicate effectively by using smaller words, relational concepts, and pictures. Like the family pet, you can all get along (maybe), but you might consider it immoral for a child to engage in a contract with an adult or gross for a human to treat a pet as a person. I thought I would edit this to provide some more examples specific to what you had asked. At 130, the gap is roughly that between a high school freshman and a high school senior. At 150, the gap is roughly the developmental distance between a second grader and a high school sophomore. 

You might have Gene Roddenberry's 'Star Trek' universe. From most of the pre-reboot shows, every member of the Federation enjoys a guaranteed income which is sufficient to cover most needs and wants. In some episodes they mention rations of replicator use or computer time. This is made possible by sufficient technological sophistication and sufficient surplus energy to provide most basic needs. I would suggest this is what you need to get away from commerce and barter: the ability to provide almost all basic needs automatically. But not everyone gets a starship, or gets the resources to build their personal science facility in deep space. In Roddenberry's universe there was a black market of people swapping replicator rations, cheating to get a Captain's chair, lying to get their science project the resources it needs. Some other species never left currency behind, and some citizens of the Federation would participate in the Ferengi cash or other barter economies to get things that their Federation allowances would not let them have. Roddenberry, with the Q, provided a way to break through even that limitation by having every want be something that can be provided easily. You could take a little bit from The Matrix, and provide every want virtually. 

And Their Are Examples of Societies Language, Culture, and Customs Being Lost And there are times when a society has crumbled so completely that, even though monuments remain, we can no longer read the language. Culture is completely lost. And the monuments may stand for centuries before researchers unlock the language with the help of Rosetta Stones, and we are left to re-invent sciences in the meantime. 

The initial acceleration may not be terrible. Consider the initial break in billiards: some balls move very little, or not at all. It's all about how the momentum is distributed. 

Here are some options: Pheromones, chemical language, viral/bacterial/prion based communication. Member of your hive mind only communicate by direct contact, or by direct contact with something that another member of the hive mind touched (like psychometry, but with chemicals). While others might recognize how the beings communicate, spoofing the messages would require understanding what is being said and how. If you go for bacterial communication, or something like tardigrades, it might be very difficult to suppress a message, as it spreads across the environment (maybe harmlessly), picked up by carriers and/or is difficult to destroy. Alternatively, they could just send flashes of lights and use Morse code. Your beings are a hive mind, so rather than words and letters, they may use logograms and relational concepts (think of the Star Trek: Next Generation episode Darmak and Jalad at Tanagra). Sharing complete understanding with one another, your hive mind might also always be talking in terms of the big picture, instead of specific details (see the Arrival, I think - recent movie with squid like aliens). These different linguistic frameworks, which presume deep understanding of the hive mind (which the hive mind has) can effectively encrypt communication happening in plain sight. Or, since your being is a galactic hive mind they may use multi modal communication, just like we do. We use written words, spoken words, visual signs, clothing, and performance. Your hive mind may use sounds, chemicals, colors (passively) or lights. 

Rising Water Melting ice caps or some sort of major shift adjusting the sear levels could drown the continent. 

Capturing territory in our world is done by vehicles. Holding territory or guerilla warfare is done by infantry. Vehicles can carry heavy armor. They can carry weapons both devestating to massed infantry (fuel-air bombs, high caliber machine guns, tank shotguns) and devastating to their own kind. They can carry sophisticated electronics that allow them to engage from miles away, impossibly far for infantry to meaningfully reply (like ship mounted artillery, aircraft, or tanks). They can travel faster than a soldier can walk, and can often compensate for their own motion - meaning they can engage accurately at top speed. There's a very impressive video somewhere of an M1A1 jumping over an embankment at top speed and firing off a shot accurately. Infantry, and only infantry really, can hold territory. They are the thousands of eyes, ears and minds performing routine patrols, investigating suspicious activity, taking action, doing the follow up, and living in the captured territory day and night. Also only infantry are light and multi capable enough to perform guerilla warfare - hiding among buildings or brush, approaching a target for a specific purpose, doing the job, and disappearing before any response. 

Depends on what you (or these aliens) call slavery. We've used many definitions over the years. "Work without pay" is the Sunday school definition, but in all cases slaves are compensated with room and board, at least (otherwise they would die of starvation in about 7 days), and sometimes education and extra money for nice things. In indentured servitude, the slave had a somewhat ambiguous time for when they would buy themselves out of the contract. In both indentured servitude and Dutch/American slavery the "owner" had considerable control over decision making - where they could work, who they could socialize with. Discipline could take any form from cutting extra benefits, reducing room and board, or beating and imprisonment. In "company towns" where people had no practical alternative to working for some local employer the same powers and discipline applied. Locals, on paper, had freedom to petition their government for grievances, but it was a dead-end practically speaking. Likewise, in feudalism, serfs could petition the ruler (higher rank baron/baroness or the king/queen) if a local lord was abusing his custom, or badly mismanaging the land. The lord's powers were thus limited by whatever protections people had carved out for themselves, provided the higher level of governments wished to enforce those rules. In our modern system, an employee may leave an employer - blackballing is a possibility. Some employers are demanding more visibility into what an employee does off the clock and who he/she socializes with, and they discipline employees acting in a way the employer sees as unbecoming. On paper, an employee may move to any employer he or she wishes, or choose no employer at all. But larger economic forces, such as unemployment rates, can drive skilled professionals into minimum wage, abusive jobs because there is "nowhere else to go". If you choose the last of these systems (and your aliens are certainly smart enough to), you can encourage people to produce a lot, with less than room and board in compensation (people tripling up in an apartment to afford rent). As long as people genuinely believe that they must stay plugged into the system and that one day it will pay off, you keep things under control without the need for any great spending in armed force. In this case, though, the people aren't bitter. They consider themselves to be struggling against forces of nature or fate or mathematics, not against aliens. 

Any of the Rishi (sages) were much like Titania, Oberon, or Puck. They wandered the world and, if offended, could curse or bless with mere words and immediate effect. Specifically, I'm thinking about how the Rishi cursed Pandu to not be able to have children. Pandu's wife called in a favor from another Rishi to work around the curse. The naga king Vasuki also springs to mind - having family (a daughter, at least) and living near natural environs. His family took Bhima from the river when he had been poisoned by his cousin and cured the poison. He also gave Bhima super strength. 

There are a few ways of looking at this, like you said Safe Magical Light Per here 900 lumens (a bright, sunny day) is only about 15 Watts of limited-spectrum lighting, and maybe 60 Watts at a wider spectrum that includes infrared. The average human body, at rest is putting off about 100 Watts of power. So, the extra heating may be moderately uncomfortable in the full-spectrum/high-power case, but probably almost unnoticeable in the limited-spectrum/low-power case. What makes coherent light dangerous is the focusing of power on a small space, increasing the Watts per meter squared. Maybe a magician is only strong enough to keep the W/m^2 at or below a certain threshold, which is why stronger magicians can fire killing beams (or throw around lightning). Power is also related to frequency (E=hc/lambda), so saying a magician is limited to a certain W/m^2 covers emission of cosmic radiation or other very high energy/dangerous light. There are two orders of magnitude between the wavelengths of the bottom and top end of the visible spectrum, so you could very well constrain wizard-produced light to the useful, but not dangerous regime. If a wizard could fine tune the produced light, it could be beneficial to illuminate plants with just the right frequency and amplitude internally, bypassing dirt, wax, cell walls, and whatever. Dangerous Magical Light Going in the other direction, one author had proposed that wizard light was created by the magician evoking a tiny amount of matter converting itself directly to energy at the wizard's command. For the wattage of a typical LED, that would be about 100 femtograms per second (if I'm doing the math right) of mass/energy conversion. This would be unsafe (really unsafe) unless the wizard took extra precautions to filter or frequency shift the light - so, in this case, the magician could pull out the stops and let a light be silently harmful (baleful light), instead of helpful. However, something simple like water or even air should capture the high-energy light past a certain distance. Another used concept is that magic is pulling from alternate realities or extra dimensional spaces. In those cases, too, unless the wizard is taking additional measures to filter the light, there should be some high-energy dangerous light being emitted with the good.
