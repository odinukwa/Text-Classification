As a fan of C. S. Peirce, I'm surprised that, at least triadic relations, aren't investigated as much as binary relations are. What I mean is that with binary relations, they have already been classified by reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and the list continues e.g. in the semantics of modal logic. But as far as I can find, outside of Peirce, there isn't an equivalent investigation into triadic relations (Peirce seems to say that all relations beyond ternary ones "reduce" in some sense to unary, binary, or ternary relations). Additionally, at one time I tried, but wasn't a mathematician enough, to classify all possible "ideas" that could at least be formulated in first order logic. For instance, a reflective relation was one where it is true that (x)(Rxx), and so I realized that even binary relations could be classified where multiple relations are involved. For instance, just as a symmetric relation satisfies (x)(y)(Rxy & Ryx) you can have relations that are only symmetrical along two predicates e.g. (x)(y)(Rxy & Syx). Does this make sense? Basically, I'm asking if there is any reason why formal logic focuses on binary relations involving one predicate among the vast sea of other kinds of logical relations that also express our concepts? Am I just not finding the relevant literature or is this just a cultural and historical artifact? 

But you ask if formal logic is suitable for philosophical reasoning. I would say that formal logic is a tool, but a dangerous tool if used the wrong way. You should only count on it when you have mastered it. Seems that many of the answers here were by people who weren't aware of the paradoxes of material implication, so this shows you how difficult formal logic really can be especially when you actually try to use it to solve real problems. It is unfortunate that we even use material implication, that we have a special logical connective and symbol for it, and that we are all taught that "if then translates as material implication in formal logic". You can do just fine in formal logic without material implication, and you should only translate if/then as material implication when you are sure that material implication has all of, and only, the logical properties that you need. This example would be much better off if you use first-order relations instead of material implication. For instance, you could express explicitly what sort of logical properties that one thing being located in something else imply, e.g., that if Dave is in London, and London is in England, then Dave is in England. It helps to break material implication down when you use. For instance, Dave being in London material implies that Dave is in England breaks down into either Dave is not in London or Dave is in England, for instance. Is that really the break down that you were expecting? 

I've been interested in philosophical skepticism lately as I've just recently learned about the close relationship between certain schools of ancient skepticism and fallibilism, which I'm told is the most common epistemology of modern science. I've also learned about one particular philosopher among the ancient skeptics, Carneades, who originated the modern concept of probability. According to, for instance, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Carneades made use of the concept of probability, or in his tongue to pithanon, as the answer to the common response to skeptics that it is simply impractical to live while denying the existence of knowledge. While neither reason, ideas, nor perception can form the basis of knowledge, they all grant us probabilities that we can use to investigate our other impressions of reason or the senses, at least enough to get along with our practical affairs. Am I paraphrasing his philosophy wrong? So while I used to see philosophical skepticism as entirely different than scientific skepticism, or our modern scientific worldview in general, now I wonder if they are perhaps much more alike than I realized. Maybe it is simply that the concept of "knowledge" has changed over the centuries. For instance, whereas before maybe knowledge was identical with certainty and absolute truth, and now days our concept of knowledge is so infused with fallibilism and pragmatism, that in the ancient context we would find ourselves far more at home in the skeptic school than in any of the others. Basically, from the position of modern science, were the ancient skeptics right all along? Would it make sense to begin our epistemology of science with them? 

So are there anymore? Also feel free to drop titles of awesome utopian/dystopian novels, at least the ones that weren't mandated reading for half the world, in the comments or something. Thanks 

I'm not a neuro-scientist by any means, but if you are talking about straight up right lobe in one person and left lobe in another, it would get a little weird. I would say philosophically, you would have two individual entities, which covered in another answer. Legally I think your stuff would get split up like in a divorce or something, if the two entities couldn't agree that is. I mean, you are essentially divorcing the two lobes of your brains. Either way that court case would get all up on national or even international news, and possibly into the Supreme Court. Edit: I believe Dave already addressed some of the functionality of the two half brained entities with that video of Dr. Ramachandran, and his work. Which I will totally watch when I get home. However for the straight up brain copy, you would still remain your individual entity. You would be you, and your stuff would be yours, and your job would still be yours (unless you work for a company that does not believe in cloning and by being a part of that experiment you would be going against the goals of that company). The new entity would also be it's own entity, as the previous answer stated, instantiated up to that point in your life. From then on it's free to make it's own choices, to do hard drugs, or become a mechanical engineer. The only thing I would say you morally owe your clone, or copy, is what anyone would owe any living thing they bring into this world, until it can provide for itself, or at least has the ability to. Which it already should, but a place to crash until it can get a job and find it's own place would be nice. The follow up question in my mind becomes a moral one for cloning workers. Like you have this small workforce of people who spent their lives becoming masters of their craft, and now you can have as many masters of that craft you want, if you have the money of course. 

I am looking for philosophical texts that tackle the subject of Utopia. This is what I was able to find, that wasn't a novel. 

Woah, something I actually read in my one year of college for philosophy. Now remember folks, this here is pure conjecture. I would say that Socrates, or Socrates as shown through Plato, don't put much stock into free will based off that Utopia they(?) came up with. I think they more or less viewed it as a thing people just irrationally do, which honestly is fairly accurate. I mean, if you look at that class schema that they wanted to implement, it was pretty bad, in terms of what you were allowed and not allowed to do, in the light of free will that is. You would be bred for certain roles in society, and you were demoted, or promoted where necessary. If you started to show certain qualities, they would pick your job for you. Families would be abolished and replaced with the community. Socrates was probably one of the first advocates of Eugenics. And of course the Philosophers would be the main decision makers. I mean, his utopia works on a community level, but not on an individual level. Socrates didn't care much for the emotional side of people in general. I forget the exact wording, but he pretty much totally disregarded any conclusion one made with their physical senses, stating that they aren't nearly as trustworthy as your own mind, or at least his mind. So with all this conjecture, I would say he didn't care for it much. Edit: So with this conjecture I would say he at least respected it, but thought it was more of a nuisance. Or he thought it wasn't true free will if they weren't exercising their logic and reason to decide what they wanted to do. Also if I got anything wrong, please let me know, and I will change the error of my ways. I mean, it has been a few years since I read Plato's writings in general. Lastly, This is just one topic. I'm not totally riffing on Socrates here, only his view on utopia. 

I was listening to Neil deGrasse Tyson on Star Talk the other day, and he was answering a question about orbits. But he added that it's not entirely true that, for instance, the earth orbits the sun, because the earth doesn't orbit the sun's center. Rather, both the earth and the sun both orbit their common center of gravity, which happens to be really close to the center of the sun, but not exactly. He also said that this isn't entirely true either, and I forget what exactly his reason was, but for some reason this reminded me of Peirce's essay defining a new list of categories. His categories begin with Being, which is the unity itself, whenever you predicate anything of anything else. His list ends with Substance, which he refers to as the What Is, which is the basic empirical content of the world that can't be summed up in any sort of concept scheme. Between Being and Substance are several different grades of concept, each one becoming more sophisticated, in the same way that the concept of orbit was slowly becoming more sophisticated. So when I think of a statement such as that the earth orbits the sun, I generally think of the simplest version, unless I think of it some more, and then I think of the more sophisticated version. Maybe, if I think about it some more, I can grow even more sophisticated, by noting the gravitational influence of more and more bodies on the orbit of the earth and the sun, whether the strong influence of Jupiter in our solar system, to the extremely slight and insignificant, yet certain, gravitational influence of distant galaxies. Ultimately, I might conclude that all mass orbits all other mass, but by now I'm using the term "orbit" in an extremely sophisticated but difficult way. I question if even concept of "orbit" should even apply here. So is it valid to be a skeptic of concepts here and say that all of our concepts are really false in a similar way? Is there any way of measuring how close to "substance" a concept is, or is this an idiosyncratic Peircean invention? 

So the argument could be debated, not necessarily on the original research as if you were both experts on the matter, but on the credibility of authorities that you are citing. In your case, you would both need to know something about the author of the book you read, and whether he should be considered a reliable source. Are there other experts who disagree with him? 

I'm having a thought that I would like more expert opinion on, as this crosses boundaries between philosophical logic and political science. My premise is that a political ideology can be represented as (or, I prefer, actually is) a logical system. We know that certain logical systems are undecidable such as first-order predicate logic. Logical systems can have other meta-logical properties as well, such as soundness, consistency, completeness, and their respective negations. So this challenges my understanding of meta-logic as well, which I'm not completely fluent in. Examples of political ideologies which I would represent as logical systems are things like Marxism, as well as particular systemizations of feminism, scientific racism, etc (Note: The intent isn't to equivocate any of these, just that these are the best examples I can think of that are clear enough to understand formally. I wouldn't consider things like liberalism or conservatism as ideologies, because they aren't based on a system of ideas, but seem to represent a coalition of interests. Valid?). Scientific theories can also be formalized, but differ from ideologies they don't aim to change things politically or culturally (I know that in some quarters this is controversial). If someone wants a reference, I'll dig for it, but I've recently read that basically the more expressive a logical system is, the more difficult are it's meta-logical properties...I think decidability itself is mentioned here. Another premise to my thinking is that when you analyze a body of work (an ideology in this case) into a logical system, the more expressive that logical system is the more arguments you might find that are valid. For instance, "All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal." is invalid if analyzed at the level of propositional logic. I assume that this pattern continues the more expressive the logic is, as long as the more expressive logic is a strict superset of it. For instance, second-order logic will find more validities than first-order logic, etc. I beg for some charity in trying to understand my gist here. So my question is whether this argument makes sense either logically or philosophically. Basically, I see most of the political ideologies that we know of are either logically undecidable, or are on the path to becoming undecidable, as the ideology is refined through iteration, dealing with contradictions (either external or internal) and political opposition by becoming more subtle and nuanced in the ideas and propositions they express. For instance, Marxism itself represents an advanced iteration of intellectualized socialism. I can go to white supremacist websites and find someone with lengthy logical attempts to argue for the truth of their views. My issue is with the idea I said before that an argument's validity depends on the logical system, and you can often analyze the same argument using more or less expressive logical systems. I'll use the term "correct" to mean that the argument was found valid after the "best" analysis of the natural language argument. So what does it mean for an argument to be "correct" when it requires an undecidable logical system to analyze the statement? Well, it means that we may never be able to prove that the argument is invalid, even if the proponents of the ideology assert the truth and rationality of it in the best conscience? I also wonder about arguments that require something like second-order logic, or something of similar complexity, that we may say are sound, but are incomplete. So the ideology might be right, but we can never prove it? Or what if the ideology is logically inconsistent, would we ever be able to establish that? It seems to me, that if there is any basis to this, then it justifies quite a bit of skepticism of a political process based on rational argument and logical debate. Am I right?
