There are also a number of islands named Pigeon. The article More absurd place names: Towns named for animals has a list of places in the US named after animals - it seems most states have a place named after an animal. 

The precise wording Attila the Hun in English has been in use for at least a couple of centuries but its use in academic writing (at least) was somewhat inconsistent until fairly recently. The earliest use of Attila the Hun I've found is in William Julius Mikel's introduction to his 1776 translation of The Lusiad by Luis de Camoes. In the same sentence, he also uses Alaric the Goth. The peom itself, though, only uses Attila. Edward Gibbon used it in volume 12 of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire in the 1789 (new edition, but it probably also appears in an earlier edition). However, whereas Attila King of the Huns appears 15 times, Attila the Hun is used only once (out of a total of 39 references to Attila). Attila the Hun also appears in a 1915 translation of Jordanes, but not in J. B. Bury's The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians from 1928, nor in E.A. Thompson's History of Attila and the Huns from 1948. Recent publications use Attila the Hun consistently, often in the title; see, for example, historical works by John Man (2010), Philip Matyszak (2009) and Christopher Kelly (2008). There are, of course, numerous references to Attila the Hun by non-historians and in popular culture, one of the best known being Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun by Wess Roberts, originally published in 1985. The calypso musician Raymond Quevedo went by the name Atilla the Hun (no, this not a typo - he used one 't' and double 'll') from at least the 1930s, maybe as early as 1911. Concerning the popular (but basically nonsensical) expression to the right of Attila the Hun, this site says:

The term 'water party' is still in use today, though with a far wider range of meanings and social groups (see, for example, Urban Dictionary and babble.com). 

In short, either when it was empty or it had a stand. Drinking horns were used by many different cultures on different continents (Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe e.t.c.) and in different time periods up to this day. Often, they were not intended to be put down while liquid remained but this was not always the case. Xenophon, among others, attested to drinking from horns in Thrace and emptying the horn was clearly an expected ritual, be it in the course of a discourse or when drinking to someone's health. The Thracians also engaged in drinking matches. In Roman Artefacts and Society, Ellen Swift says early Roman drinking horns were mostly small and "drinking from the tip was the norm in the early Roman period" and some "have an applied foot that affords standing on a flat surface". Later examples are larger, mostly drunk from the mouth and seem to be designed to be passed around and not set down until empty. 

It appears that all was not lost for Friso, though, as he became a general under the Duke of Marlborough and served with distinction until he drowned when a ferry he was on sank in bad weather in July 1711. This seems to have been particularly bad timing as (from Wiki) 

The idea of naming ships goes back several thousand years but, unsurprisingly, there is very little evidence from the earliest days of sailing. EGYPT If we accept names from mythology, then we might consider the Ancient Egyptian god Ra's solar barque, the Atet, which was known by two names:

Photo source: Un homme de tetes, 1898. A still from one of the many trick films which, at the time, was not considered worth preserving. This 1898 film Un homme de tetes fortunately did survive. The film (about 1 minute) can be viewed here. Sadly, Melies had destroyed his remaining films in 1923 as he had nowhere to store them. Likewise, most American studios destroyed most of their silent film archives: they saw no value in them, celluloid film was dangerous to store and the studios needed the storage space. Consequently, it is estimated that 75% of all American films made before 1930 are lost forever. As with almost all other films of the period, Melies’ collection of studio-bound trick and scifi / fantasy films were seen to have little or no commerial value once they had been seen by the public, even though they were hugely popular in the late 1890s and early 1900s. There were no TV or cable companies these films could be sold to after their initial release.

Graham Sumner, in Roman Military Dress (2nd edition, 2009), also accepts the findings of re-enactors and notes the changing styles of the 'apron' during the 1st and 2nd centuries. He refers to the 'apron' as a "popular fashion". Further, Hoss notes that, in the 2nd century,

SHORT ANSWER The Ottomans used camels because they have several advantages over horses. Among other things, they can carry more than horses and adapt well to a variety of climates (even cold ones) and terrain, and were thus ideal for transporting the large quantities of supplies needed by the Ottoman armies. DETAILED ANSWER Camels were used in large numbers by the Ottomans for a number of very good reasons. The setbacks of 1529 and 1683 at Vienna were primarily due to insufficient firepower in order to breach the walls of Vienna, not to the use of camels. In this regard, the campaign of 1683 did indeed repeat the mistake of 1529. 

Even more implausible is 2 ounces for the fleece of a sheep. According to sheep101, a fleece in the US today might weigh anything from 2 to 16 pounds (32 to 288 ounces). Even just taking the lowest figure, the difference between medieval and contemporary fleece weights seems improbable, or is at least in need of more authoritative sources. Were the animals cited in the sources really so much smaller (on average) than they are today? Was the same true for other farm animals such as chickens and pigs? 

"Depiction of the "Susian guards" from the Palace of Darius I in Susa. Their garments match the description of the Immortals by ancient authors." Attrib: Pergamon Museum [CC BY 2.0 ($URL$ via Wikimedia Commons We also know that the Persian King Xerxes I had in his court the deposed Spartan King Demaratos who informed his benefactor he should not expect the Spartans to flee the battlefield. Demaratos would certainly have had a good idea of how his former 'subjects' felt. Nonetheless, at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC, King Leonidas respected the Immortals enough to put his best troops in the front line when Xerxes sent his elite force into battle on the second day. The answer the larger question of to what extent the Greeks feared the Persians (rather than just the immortals) depends largely on whether you are referring to the Greeks before 490 BC (Battle of Marathon), or before the Persian invasion of 480 BC, or after the Persians had finally been defeated at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC. The Spartan King Kleomenes (c.519 to c.490 BC) was one Greek leader who recognized the threat which Persia posed, not because of one part of the Persian army but because of the vastness of her empire and the seemingly inexhaustible resources of manpower and wealth at her disposal. When the Ionian revolt (499 - 493 BC) broke out, only Athens and Eretria lent support to the rebels; everyone else stayed out of it, not wishing to draw Persian attention to mainland Greece. Richard A. Billows argues that the Athenian-led victory at Marathon was an important turning point, for the Greeks realized that, even if outnumbered, they could still defeat the Persians. However, the Persian invasion of 480 BC was an altogether bigger affair: the Greeks were heavily outnumbered both on land and at sea so, again, the Greeks were more worried about the huge Persian resources than anything else. After the defeat of the Persians at Plataea, Greek attitudes changed: 

A NOTE ON SPARTA IF one considers the Messenian helots as slaves (which many historians do not, preferring to call them serfs), there were a number of revolts against Spartan ownership of the land and the people. For the most part, though, the helots of Messenia were not 'runaways' - Messenia was, after all, their home. However, the Athenians helped to establish the city of Naupaktos
