Suppose that instead of the usual circle, we pick some other convex set D and make the Delaunay triangulation of a finite planar point set with respect to this set, i.e. connect two points if there is a homothet of D that contains both of them on its boundary and no points inside. If the points are in a general position such that no four fall on the boundary of a homothet of D, then we still obtain a triangulation (plus some infinite face). Can anyone provide a good reference for this statement, how should I cite it? I need it not only for smooth D but also for polygons. 

The Lovasz Local Lemma has several generalizations, with names usually starting with L, such as Lopsided or Lefthanded. Here I ask whether another possible generalization (for which I could not yet find a name starting with L) holds or not. Suppose that for some events $\mathbf A$ we have a dependency graph and an assignment $x$ that is degenerate in the sense that $\exists A \in \mathbf A$ such that $\Pr[A] \;\leqslant\; x(A) \prod_{B \in \Gamma(A)} (1-x(B))$ and after deleting $A$ we again have another such event from $\mathbf A\setminus \{A\}$ etc. In other words, I want that the events can be ordered such that $$\Pr[A] \;\leqslant\; x(A) \prod_{\substack{B \in \Gamma(A)\\ B<A}} (1-x(B)).$$ Is this sufficient to guarantee that we can avoid all events? ps. I don't care about the exact formula, it might hold only with some weaker inequality, that is also OK. 

Suppose we have a (simple) bipartite graph with $2^k$ edges. Is it true that there is a subset of the vertices such that their induced subgraph has exactly $2^{k-1}$ edges? I know that the answer is no for general graphs, since you can take a $K_6$ plus a disjoint edge. I also know that if we don't require the number of edges to be a power of 2, the answer is again no as shown by a $K_{5,9}$ plus a disjoint edge. I suspect that the answer to my question is also no. Remark: A similar question where the smallest counterexample has $181^2$ ``edges'': $URL$ Update: I know this holds for $k\le 3$ even for general graphs. 

Let $D$ be the digraph on $2^d$ vertices with $d2^d$ edges that we obtain by directing each edge of the $d$-dimensional hypercube in both directions. 

I edited my answer after the clarification of the question. Consider the union of two different color classes. This subgraph consists of disjoint edges and (possibly) a path of length 2. This gives the following bound if the paths can have length 2: $\sum_i {deg(v_i) \choose 2}\le {N\choose 2}$ Of course this is just a necessary and not a sufficient condition, but it might be a good start for an NP-completeness proof. 

Here I prove that it does not matter whether we consider only connected dominoes or not, as there was a lot of discussion about it. Suppose that the original polyomino, P, is d dimensional. We will construct a 2d dimensional connected polyomino, Q, that can be tiled with P. Clearly, this proves the statement, as if it is impossible to tile any space with P, it is also impossible to do so with Q. Denote a large enough d dimensional brick that contains P by R. Take the 2d dimensional polyomino P x R, so here every original cube of P is replaced by a 2d brick, 1 x R. Note that P x R is contained in an R x R brick. Fill in the missing parts of this R x R brick by 1 x P polyominos. Notice that this means that R x P will be also filled up completely. This polyomino, Q, will be connected, as we can freely move anywhere in the first d coordinates in R x P and in the last d coordinates in P x R. Note: The complement of the set obtained this way is R\P x R\P. If we repeat this, then it can be achieved that our polyomino is arbitrarily dense, i.e. it fills out at least 99% of a brick. 

The problem is also trivially NP-complete without an anchor tile. The trick is that we can easily force any tile to become an anchor tile. First, take a set of tiles that have a unique way of tiling an $n\times n$ square, e.g., by putting (respectively matching) $(i,j)$'s on their sides where $1\le i,j\le n$. Then take the "direct product" of this tile set with, e.g., the tile set described by Joel except for the position where you want your anchor tile, there keep only that. This gives a suitable tile set. ps. I used to give this as an exercise for undergrads and some of them always solved it. 

This is not an answer, just a reformulation of the question, which, imho, has nothing to do with functions. Just notice that if some $f_1, g$ and $f_2, g$ pairs satisfy your condition, then so does $f_1+f_2, g$, which implies that it is enough to consider 0-1 functions, which correspond to sets. So a reformulation would be: In a given poset $P$, is it true that for any $A$ and $B$ upwards closed subsets $|A|\cdot |B|\le |A\cap B|\cdot |P|$ holds? As you have noted, it is necessary but not sufficient for $P$ to have a largest and smallest element. Unfortunately, I don't know whether the inequality is true or not for your poset. 

Third attempt, this time I try to prove that $G_{p,q}$ is connected. Before the proof we need a simple observation about NC partitions. Observation. Draw the elements of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ on a circle. Any NC partition $p=(p_1,\ldots,p_k)$ of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ either has a singleton part $|p_i|=1$ or a part that has at least two consecutive elements (such as $1$ and $2$). Proof. There are two very similar cases, we start with the simpler. It will be convenient to imagine that the path goes from $q$ to $p$. Case 1: $p$ has a singleton part $p_i=\{m\}$. Consider any path from $q$ to $p$. Suppose that it does not start with a partition move that separates $m$ from whichever part it belongs to in $q$. At some point, $p_i$ has to be created and thus $m$ separated from a part. But we could execute this separation already in the previous step and do the previous operation after this, as $p_i$ is a singleton and cannot cause any troubles (crossings). Thus, every such path is adjacent to another in $G_{p,q}$ that separates $m$ in an earlier step, and therefore, every path in $G_{p,q}$ is connected to another that starts with separating $m$. But then we can just delete $m$ from both $p$ and $q$ and use induction on $n$. Case 2: $p$ has a part $p_i$ that contains two consecutive elements. Without loss of generality, we can suppose $1,2\in p_i$. If $1$ and $2$ are in the same part of $q$, then we could consider them as one element (as in every shortest path they must stay in the same parts) and we are again done by induction. Otherwise, let $1\in q_1$ and $2\in q_2$. Now we consider the step when the parts containing $1$ and $2$ are unioned together. If this is not the first step, then we could do it one step earlier as this can create no crossings. But, like in the previous case, we can suppose that we start with taking the union of $q_1$ and $q_2$, thus we are done again (either by joining $1$ and $2$ into a single element, or by induction on the length of the shortest $p$-$q$ path). 

This problem was solved (up to a small multiplicative factor) by Erdos and Renyi: $URL$ Ps. Wow, Douglas Zare has a good intuition! 

In general, there is (probably) no efficient way to compute even the discrepancy. To see it is NP-hard, notice that a NAE-3SAT formula can give a set system that has discrepancy<3 if and only if the formula is satisfiable. Moreover, every set can be made to have exactly 3 points, so the hereditary discrepancy would be the same. Of course if you have only 20 points, then there can be some ways to calculate it in a reasonable time, unfortunately I don't know anything about these. 

Here is a $\Omega(\log n)$ bound for $X$ if Alice follows a very restricted strategy. I think this shows well why this might be the bound and the difficulty of the problem. Suppose Alice decides for every ball $i$ whether she takes it or not with probability $p_i$ independently (if she has not yet found a red ball earlier). If $i\le j$, then $p_i\le p_j$, otherwise Lucy could swap the $i$th and $j$th ball and increase $X$. Denote by $t$ the largest $i$ for which $p_i< \frac{\log n}{100n}$. Lucy will put the red balls to the first $\min(t,n)$ bins and the last $n-\min(t,n)$. It is very likely that during the first $t$ steps Alice won't find any red balls. If $t> n$, then Alice's chance of failure is more than $1/n$. If $t\le n$, then Alice will (whp) ask $\Omega(\log n)$ white balls in the next $n$ steps. Unfortunately this argument only works for this very special version, but maybe some parts of it are useful for the general case too. 

Let $A= \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \\ \end{array} \right) $. Then any $x, y, z$ satisfy the conditions, so it is easy to make a counterexample. We get a more challenging question if we suppose that $A$ is non-singular, in this case there is a unique $z$ that satisfies the conditions. (Solution by my brother who is an economist.) 

It is infinite, in fact much stronger versions are also true, see e.g., Theorem 1 here: $URL$ (Shannon capacity is between $\alpha$ and $\vartheta$.) 

This is the best possible bound. If $\mathcal F$ consists of every $r$-set of a set with $r+\frac{r-t}{k-1}$ elements, then it is still $k$-wise $t$-intersecting. 

Yes, the $O(n^{d-1})$ bound holds in this case as well, with a proof that is similar to the proof of the $d$-uniform case. I would guess that this also follows from the proof of Klazar and Marcus with some easy modification, but I don't know it as well as our own proof, which you can find in Section 3 here: $URL$ First, make a $d$-uniform hypergraph $G'$ from $G$ by picking a set of size $d$ from each hyperedge. The choice is arbitrary, except that we try to maximize the number of edges of $G'$. In particular, if a hyperedge $e$ of $G$ is mapped to a hyperedge of $G'$ into which another edge of $G$ is also mapped, then all $d$-element subsets of $e$ are also in $G'$. If this happens for a hyperedge $e$ of size at least $kd$, we are done, as we can find $H$ inside $e$. Because of this, we can suppose that $G$ is uniform. The bound trivially holds for $(d-1)$-uniform hypergraphs. The rest of the proof is partly by induction, partly by repeating the argument for $d$-uniform hypergraphs. Proof for $t$-uniform hypergrahs. If $G$ has $n$ vertices, then we divide these vertices into intervals of length $s$, where $s$ is a constant that is large enough compared to $k,d$ and $t$. Denote by $E_0$ the edges of $G$ that have at least two vertices in the same interval. $|E_0|\le C_{t-1}n^{d-1}$ by induction. (This is the only part where we use induction on $t$.) Partition the rest of the edges of $G$ into $(\frac ns)^{t}$ blocks depending on which intervals the vertices belong to. Denote the hyperedges of block $b$ by $E_b$. Define $Proj_J$ as the projection that deletes the $j^{th}$ element of a hyperedge for every $j\in J$. A block $b$ is $J$-wide if $Proj_J E_b$ contains $Proj_i H$ for every $i\in \{1,\ldots,d\}$. If $b$ is not $J$-wide for any $J\subset\{1,\ldots, t\}$ with $|J|=t-d+1$, then we call it thin. We will prove by induction (on $d$) and the Loomis-Whitney inequality that $|E_b|=o(s^{d-1})$ if $b$ is thin. This will imply by contracting the intervals, the total number of edges in thin blocks is $o_s(n^{d-1})$. The Loomis-Whitney inequality says that $|E_b|^{t-1}\le \Pi_{j} |Proj_j E_b|$. To obtain $|E_b|=o(s^{d-1})$, it is enough to show for each $j$ that $|Proj_j E_b|=O(s^{d-2})$. Otherwise, $Proj_j E_b$ would contain the hypergraph $Proj_i H$ for every $i$. From this we want to show for some $J$ that $Proj_J E_b$ would also contain them. And now, it seems that I'll have to cheat a little; this statement would be trivial if by induction we were proving instead the stronger statement that there is a $|J|=t-d$ such that $Proj_J G$ contains a copy of $H$. But then we also have to verify this stronger statement in the earlier parts of this proof. The estimate for $E_0$ still holds, as if we had a lot of $j^{th}$ and $(j+1)^{st}$ vertices in the same interval, that would lead to induction as before. I don't know how to fix the argument for hyperedges that are bigger than $kd$, but luckily that can be avoided; we only need to raise the bound of $kd$ to something that also depends on $t$. The only thing left to estimate is the number of edges in $J$-wide blocks. Group the blocks into $I$-blockcolumns where $I\subset\{1,\ldots, t\}$ with $|I|=d-1$; every block belongs to exactly $\binom{t}{d-1}$ blockcolumns. An $I$-blockcolumn is determined by $d-1$ intervals, and it contains every block that is defined by these $d-1$ intervals (and $t-d+1$ other intervals). If an $I$-blockcolumn contains more than $\big((k-1)^{t-d+1}-1\big)\big(s(s-1)\cdot (s-k+1)\big)^{d(d-1)}$ $J$-wide blocks, then by the pigeonhole principle it contains $(k-1)^{t-d+1}$ blocks such that for $J=\{1,\ldots,t\}\setminus I$ the hypergraphs $Proj_J E_b$ contain the same copy of $Proj_i H$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,d\}$. (These copies are all inside the $d-1$ intervals defining the $I$-blockcolumn.) Using the pigeonhole principle again, for some $j\in J$ there are at least $k$ different intervals that contain the $j^{th}$ vertices of these blocks. But then from any $k$ blocks that use these $k$ intervals and have the same copy of the respective $Proj_i H$, we can build a copy of $H$ in $G$. Therefore, the number of $i$-wide blocks is small and the rest is calculation. 

No, it might not hold. Let $\pi=K_{4,4}$, so $|X|=8$ and each $e\in L$ contains exactly two vertices. This implies that $\ell(G_\pi)\le 8$. But for each $x\in X$ we must select at least three of the four edges meeting there in any vertex cover of $G_\pi$, thus $\tau(G_\pi)\ge 3\cdot 8/2=12$. 

I do not think that the lower bound could depend only on epsilon. Below is the sketch of my argument. Fix h=3, r=2, eps=1/4, thus we color the edges of a graph, each with 25% of all the colors and we are looking for a "monochromatic" triangle. Let us take k random bipartitions of the vertices and color the corresponding edges of the bipartite graph with one color. Using Hoeffding or some similar inequality we get that for big enough k every edge is colored at least k/4 times if n is at most exp(ck), where c is some fixed constant with some positive probability. Therefore the bound must depend on k and not only on epsilon. 

My children have some Duplo fences, these you have to put down on two points, and at both ends they extend a little where you can connect several to surround some area. So a fence is described by a triple, $x, y, z$, where $y$ is an integer, the distance between the two points, while for $x$ and $z$, the lengths of the extensions, $x+z$ has to be a positive integer. Moreover, it is natural to assume that $x$ and $z$ are also integers to allow an axis-parallel rectangle to be constructed. Apparently, Lego knows how to use the Pythagoras theorem, because the two points where you have to put them down are at distance $y=5$ from each other, so it is also possible to put down a fence diagonally, like at (0,0) and (3,4). Also, they have $x=z=2$. From here an easy calculation and checking a few cases should show that it's not possible to bound any interesting area, but only axis-parallel rectangles. So my question is that supposing you have some identical fences as mentioned above, is it possible to surround a non-rectangular area? Instead of distance 5, the base distance can be something else, and you can also pick how much the fence extends, so I'm interested in any related results, primarily in small, realizable examples, that Lego could make. For example, if $x=y=z=5$, then it's easy to make a rotated square, or a rhombi, of side length 15, as pointed out by Gerhard, but this I consider a trivial solution. Note on update: In the first version of the problem I've missed the simple construction by jwim, which works if $x=z=0$, as I've posed the problem badly first. 

An affirmative answer would imply the four-color theorem, so I guess the answer has to be no, but I've failed to find a counterexample. Or would this problem be equivalent to the four-color theorem? 

I am interested in the following simplified version of poker. Each player gets a card (for example, either A or B). Then they bet knowing their own cards (for example, the pot initially has 1 euro, then they go in order and decide to fold or add 10 euros to the pot, then after the last player the betting is over). After the betting, either those distribute the money who have A or those who have B (for example, with 60% chance A wins and with 40% chance B wins). What are the optimal strategies if the players want to maximize their expected income? Note that I am most interested if the game has at least 3 players and it is crucial that the outcome can depend on the flop, unlike most theoretically studied versions, like Kuhn poker or when the inputs are from the [0,1] interval. Has this ever been studied? I wonder if paradoxical situations can happen, like the last player should bet with a higher probability when his card is B than with A (when A has a higher chance of winning).
