Food We are already partially there. It can get worse. People will eat whatever is available in the "food" section of the shop. Food companies will sell whatever is cheapest to produce. Today "cheapest to produce" results in stuff that is at least biologically based, like tofu. With future technology this can change. If it gets cheaper to build "food" from base chemicals the companies will start to do that. Without knowing how technology improves it is hard to guess exactly what this "food" will look like, but some type of fat/sugar mix with added vitamins seems likely. Today many governments subsidize farming. In your dystopia, they have stopped doing that. This means actual biological food is going to be much more expensive, and most people simply can't afford it. In many countries today the quality of food is partly determined by government regulations, but in your dystopia this won't apply. Sleep. As far as we know today, people need sleep. We can do without for short periods, but eventually we fall asleep or die. However, it is quite possible that future drugs will change that. Once there are sleep-replacement pills that actually work, people will be eager to take them to add more hours to the week. In a dystopia, more working hours, obviously. Sex Making people give up sex is going to be hard. There are strong instincts that will make teenagers sneak off and do the deed. Adults too, for that matter. If people only meet on the Net there will be fewer chances for them to sneak off. Maybe the thought of actually meeting and touching somebody has become abhorrent. There are drugs that will make people less horny, but why would people take them? You could mix them in the food, I guess, but it would be hard to get the dosage right. In some dystopia I have forgotten the title to there is a mandatory computerized doctor that both take blood samples and give medicine injections. It could be used to adjust dosage properly. By the way, many anti-depressants have this effect, and these medicines can be useful for keeping people semi-happy in a dystopia anyway. Win-Win! (You might want to think about where children come from in this society. Cloning, perhaps?) 

One very important question is "Who is doing the name calling?" If all of humanity is moving forward more or less in lockstep, they will call each other "human" at all stages. They might have other names for the previous stages, typically "pre-something humans". However, knowing humanity, we will not move forward in lockstep. There will be conservatives, lagging behind, and there will be progressives, surging ahead. These groups will have names for each other that will not be complimentary. "cave people" and "inhumans" is probably some of the kinder terms. On the other hand, they will have very complimentary terms for themselves, like "true humans" and "future humans". Note that these names are all relative. One generations progressive "future human" can be the next generations conservative "true human". Looking at history we find that group names can be very random, this will no doubt continue into the future. The founders of the group have some concept they think is very important and defines their philosophy. Later that concept falls by the wayside, but the name remains. In summary, you can call these groups whatever you want, as long as it makes sense to the characters using the terms. 

The laws of physics AS WE KNOW THEM, does not allow such an act. But really, they don't forbid it either. These laws describe the universe from the inside, because that is the only viewpoint we have available. What happens outside the universe, if an outside exists at all, is beyond the scope of our theories. What is needed is a "God" time that is independent of "Universe" time. Universe time stops, everything in the universe stops. God lives on God time and takes a vacation. Later on, they start the Universe Clock again and everything starts moving again like nothing happened. Computers do this all the time. Computer programs run in small universes of their own. They think they run continuously, but in really they execute in short bursts with pauses in between. Normally these pauses are very short, less than a tenth of a second, but if you activate sleep mode they can last much longer. A computer program can discover this in two ways. One is simply looking at the system clock. The other that they were connected to some server and that server closed the connection due to inactivity. In both cases the program is looking outside its universe to discover that outside time has moved on without it. There is no way a program can discover this just by looking inside its own world. Unless there is a bug. Returning to God and our Universe. I assume God is competent enough that they won't have bugs in the creation. Then the only way to discover the pauses is by looking outside the Universe, which we don't know how to do. Yet. 

Propaganda This machine shows the truth, and everybody know it. However, it only shows a ten-minute slice of the truth and that can be a very misleading. It is also limited to a small area, which can also be very misleading. The government knows this. So, the government invites selected historians to witness carefully selected parts of history. These publicly trusted historians then publishes descriptions of what they saw. And thereby the public thinks they have been told the truth. As the years go by, I can also imagine the government staging ten-minute "plays" just so they can later go back and watch them with their selected witnesses. Maybe multiple different plays if they aren't sure of which will be needed later on. Intelligence It was not clear if you could send these expeditions to any part of Earth or not. If you can, Intelligence will indeed be drooling. If you are limited to were you can place a time machine today + ten minutes walk, not so interesting. There will certainly be uses for this, but in most cases there will be cheaper ways. Privacy Privacy is already non-existent with today's surveillance technology, but society seems pretty unchanged by it. Both for ordinary surveillance and the new time surveillance, the only defense is to seem uninteresting. As a terrorist you have to make sure to look utterly normal until it is time to spring the bomb. To late to do anything afterwards. Imagine compressing your time line just a little, so that they could study the events leading up to Sept 11, 2001 without being rushed. Where and when would you look? Trying to backtrack the terrorists one ten-minute slot at a time would be hideously expensive before you got anywhere interesting. Lesser criminals would know that they are not worth the machine's time. 

Most symbiotic relationships start out as parasitic ones. Then the parasite gets an additional advantage by making their host prosper. Consider a floating living island. It is basically a bigger and more sturdy Portuguese man o' war. It has strong stingers both for fishing and for protection. At this point it is not very big, just a few meters. Along comes a smart sapient. It figures out how to bypass the stingers. It may be as simple as sailing a canoe and never putting a hand in the water. Careful about that paddle, though. In the beginning, it is just a place to sleep where the predators of the mainland can't reach them. There is wear and tear on the island, so it is definitely a parasitic relationship. Then they start feeding the island. At first it just to help it regrow worn parts, then it is also to make it grow. And grow it does. Now there is room for more people! Every time the sapients go out fishing, they give part of the catch to the island. And the island grows bigger, and the stingers grow stronger. The most dangerous predator is other sapients, so our islanders start enhancing the defenses so enemy canoes can't get through. Maybe just feeding the stingers until they can upend a canoe, maybe something more creative. Only natives know the safe path through the stingers. I have problems imagining a living island the size of Isle of Wright, but it should be possible. One possibility is that the living parts is just a fringe while the central parts is a wooden platform built by the sapients. 

"Safe" is always relative. Nothing in this life is completely safe. So, you have this nice looking bit of land that happens to be radioactive. Given a choice between eating the food from there and other food, you would choose other food. However, given a choice between that food and NO food, you would choose radioactive food. So, you eat what is available, you might get cancer many years from now but at least you aren't starving today. In the same manner, people are still evacuated from Bikini and Chernobyl because they can. If they had too they could move back and live there. They would have a slightly increased risk of cancer, but life is full or risks anyway. Smoking is still more risky. The limit comes when people die faster than childbirth replaces them. But this limit is very high. A mere nuclear war won't come close. (In long term effects, that is. People caught a bit too close to the initial blast would have problems) 

Of course, we don't know how to do this yet, even in theory. But it is fun to speculate. I think we can assume that different people will not be mergeable, the differences are simply too big. In fact, I think that teleport-clones can diverge to the point where merging will be inadvisable. However, that will probably take years. To avoid jarring discontinues, I sternly suggest that all scanning and merging take place while the subject is unconscious, sedated if necessary. That way they will wake up with two different "yesterdays" instead of two different "five minutes ago". In other words, no short term memory. We know quite a bit of how memory works, a quick Google search gives this link from LiveScience. In short, memories are stored as very small changes to existing cells, sometimes a single molecule can make a difference. This means that our scans have to be very detailed, which again means that storing or transmitting it will be expensive. On the other hand, the same technology should be able to solve just about any medical problem. To get the best results from a merge, you really need (at least) three scans. One stored historical scan from the point of divergence, and the two (or more) present versions that are to be merged. That way you can see what has changed from the past to each present version and put both (all) sets of changes into the same template. One can make a merge from just the present versions, but that would result in a lower quality result. One problem is that human memory isn't designed for storing too many memories. As people grow older, memories grow fuzzier and fuzzier. This is probably an effect of trying to store too much in a limited space, and I doubt it can be helped. Repeated splitting and merging will make this worse. If you have a hundred subjective years of memories it doesn't matter if they have been accumulated serially or in parallel. That head is full either way. 

I agree with o.m. that they can destroy whatever they want, but this doesn't mean that they have conquered the Earth. Big powers keep making that mistake, it seems nobody learns from history. Another scenario: Raiding They use their total aerial dominance to scout for poorly defended resources. They land surprise attacks with overwhelming force and steal whatever they need. They should also spread their attacks all over Earth and immediately take responsibility for them. This is to avoid starting World War III as that would be bad for business. North Korea When time comes to land, the Captain publicly proclaims that they have surveyed the nations of the Earth and found the perfect nation. They want to land to learn the wisdom of the eternal leaders of Mankind, the Kims. The Kim-in-power warmly welcomes them after being privately told that North Korea will be given a lot of technology for this. The mayor powers are told that any attack on the landing site will result in Mutually Assured Destruction. The Raptors stays on continuous missile intercept duty along the borders of North Korea, as well as a nuclear deterrent force. I don't think they would be able to intercept a full-scale attack by China, but they can stop single missiles that might be launched "by accident". The Battlestar is repaired with the help of North Korean workers that are not so secretly spies that learn some technology. It leaves before the major powers figure out how to get around the defenses. Later on Chinese spies learn the new tech from North Korea and Russian and American spies learn it from China. Balance is restored. 

The answer to "Do I need to..." is always no. The answer to "Can I ..." is always yes. You are making your world, what you say goes. The fact that things ended up one way in Greece doesn't mean they couldn't end up differently in your world. In this particular case I would advice against staying too close to your reference. If the reader can understand "Hey, this is Greece!" they will pull all sorts of real-world attitudes about Greece into the story where they don't belong. It is better to use several references and mix and match pieces from them. Some minor sanity checking is recommended but in general readers aren't very critical. 

The librarians like them. Wizards don't like the creatures, but librarians like them. For one thing, it keeps the wizards from casting spells in the library. Any librarian will tell you that spell-casting is a fire hazard! And what happens after a tired wizard has "just tried to heat my coffee"? Right, their efforts to stop the fire will do more damage than the fire. Give me an honest parasite any day! It enforces the "no magic in the library" rule better than any librarian. Also, keeping too many books of magic in one place is dangerous in itself. These creatures keep the magic buildup from becoming too bad. Yes, they eat the occasional scroll, but it turns out that these by pure accident are the very scrolls librarians don't want wizards to read, like Fooldare's Unquenchable Fire and Stilgar's Infinite Fountain. And when there is a magical accident, as will always happen when wizards are around, the creature will help in the cleanup. 

Longer prehistory. For a religion to spread we need long-distance travel. Horses, boats, etc. History begins when writing was invented in a form that survive for ages, and it gets used to describe events as they happen. In our world, we moved from one to the other very quickly, and no religion had time to conquer the world. In your world, there were more time. Maybe traveling was easier, maybe nobody thought writing was cool. Since this is pre-history, nobody really knows. One way or another, there was time for one cultural group and its religion to spread all over the planet and suppress all others. Small beginning. In our world, humanity hung around in Africa for a long time before spreading across the world. What if humanity had started in a smaller, more isolated place, like New Zealand? For a long time there would be only New Zealand. After a while, there would only be one surviving culture/religion there and this could happen before writing was invented. Later on better boats lets people spread all over the globe. In a sense this is a variant of the first answer, since travel is easier when all distances are small. However... There will be variants on this religion. Some variants will strongly claim that this makes them different religions. E.g. "The people over there follow a god that allows them to eat pork. The One True God does not allow its followers to eat pork, so they must have a different, false, religion."
