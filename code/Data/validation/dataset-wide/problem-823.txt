Edited. I thought about this wrong. A slowly spiraling in orbit would hit the earth at not much more than orbital speed, which is escape velocity over the square root of 2, but not a meteor approaching from a distance, so I thought about this the wrong way. Answer is no. 

So, even if it was significantly larger, it would still be in a long term unstable and "Kind of" Neptune crossing orbit, so that's a problem in the clearing out question, because Pluto itself is small enough to perhaps have been one of the things that Neptune cleared out of it's orbit a number of millions of years ago, and that's what sent Pluto into it's current orbit. 

The WFIRST's study of dark energy is pretty straight forward. It's no different than the previous ways of studying dark energy. It's not studied directly, cause we can't see it or re-create it, it's studied by the effect it has on the relative motion of distant galaxies. WFIRST will get much more accurate readings on the relative velocity of galaxies both relative to each other in their neighborhood and relative to us, this will get a significantly more accurate estimate for dark energy than was previously possible and questions can be answered such as, is it speeding up. NASA's WFIRST Web page discusses this in more detail 

Well, it's a relatively new field of study so I don't think there's any exact answers, but I've read up on this a bit out of interest. Red Dwarfs have 2 main disadvantages. One, which you've mentioned. They're relatively cold compared to our star so the planet would need to be comparatively close and therefor, probobly tidally locked. The other problem is red dwarfs tend to have very active sunspots compared to our sun, so the planet would need a crazy strong magnetic field to protect the planet. Neither of those are "deal breakers" but perhaps less likely than a sun-like star. A tidally locked planet wouldn't necessarily have a scorching hot side and a freezing cold side. Modeling suggests that temperature would circulate. If it had extensive oceans on the tidally locked side, for example, that could create a cloud cover and not cause intense heat. You could also have the sun side be far enough away to be temperate and the star-side icy, or a livable section in a ring around the planet. There's also the possibility that a tidally locked planet could have winds that we would find very difficult to adapt to. I think you'd ideally have the sun side be the habitable side for photosynthesis. On the flip side, if the star is too large, the star's life would probobly be too short for the planet to cool down enough to be habitable for us. The life of a star is the inverse cube of the size, so a star twice the size of our sun would only have a main sequence of 1.2-1.3 billion years. When you get a bit bigger than that, there's not enough time for a planet to cool off and a solar system to get past it's heavy bombardment period. So I'd give a red dwarf a better chance of having a habitable planet than a sun 2.5 times or larger than our sun. That, and red-dwarfs are the most common stars in the galaxy, so I think there's a probability that some red dwarfs could have habitable planets. 

Source article. They would have relatively small hill spheres depending on how close they were and corresponding, even smaller true regions of stability. But planetary ring systems tend to be quite close to the planet anyway and larger ring systems need to be almost exclusively inside the Roche Limit. The binary gas giant orbits would have to be outside each other's respective Roche Limits anyway and provided there was sufficient distance between then, like maybe 4-6 times the larger of the two Roche limits (ballpark guess), then it's possible to have both gas giant planets with their own ring systems. What's not possible is to have two orbiting disks around two bodies where the orbiting disks intersect each other, like they had in the Startrek Discovery premier episode. And that was forming star systems, not gas giants, but it's still impossible for any orbiting ring or debris disk to intersect the way they did it. It was a cool looking image, but clearly impossible. 

Most planets don't have rings. The ring region is inside the Roche limit which is quite close to the planet. A ring system outside the Roche limit needs to be either very faint or, it would over time coalesce into a moon or possibly pair of moons at Trojan points to each other. There's different Roche limits for rocky bodies vs icy, but an icy body couldn't exist in Earth's orbit for long, so it's not really relevant for the Earth. Saturn's rings are mostly ice, which extends about twice as far as the rocky body Roche limit. 

This isn't a simple answer. Also, do you want to know this for a simple 2 body system or the more complex, essentially 3 body system of Sun-earth-Moon. If the Earth and Moon were alone in the cosmos, far away from everything else, then over time, the tidal forces would circularize the Moon's orbit as it pushes the Moon away. The reason for this is that the same force that slowly pushes the Moon away from the Earth pushes hardest when the Moon is closest, and least hard when the Moon is furthest away, so over a long period of time that circularizes it's orbit. All 2 body systems where the moon is being pushed away tends to circularize. This can be observed in our own solar-system. Two body systems that are very far away from orbital disturbances, like Pluto-Charon or Neptune-Triton or even, Sun-Neptune, are highly circular orbits. But when you bring the Sun into the picture, everything changes. The Moon orbits the Earth and the Earth Moon system orbits the sun, and in a very real sense, the Moon also orbits the sun, but it's within the Earth's stable region of it's hill sphere, so the Moon's orbit around the Earth will remain stable for billions of years. But while it's stable, it's measurably inconstant. The moon's orbit wobbles a great deal, being stretched and contracted based on it's position in relation to the Earth and Sun. 3 body mechanics is quite complex, even with stable orbits. Isaac Newton was aware of this but he wasn't able to work it out. Mathematicians who came later were able to figure out orbital interactions with more than 2 bodies, called perturbation theory. So, your question depends on whether you mean a 2 body system or a 3 body system. The Earth's eccentricity, for example, changes on roughly a 100,000 year cycle, mostly due to Jupiter, but that effect is pretty slow, on a roughly 100,000 year cycle.
