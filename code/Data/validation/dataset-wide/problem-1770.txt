If you select any given ticket and run a on it you can view the list of properties. None of which are mapping back to the Affected User. Thinking perhaps the ticket data is saved with the user object, I ran the following code: 

So what happened? Powershell interpreted our input as a single array containing two strings which were passed to the first (positionally) variable. To get the desired result using parenthesis you'd have to do this: 

I've been googling and searching MS's website for their MSDN or technet page on this cmdlet and can't find it. Google keeps wanting to point to the Get cmdlet. I used the MS link for the Get: $URL$ And tried to use: $URL$ But it fails. The cmdlet shows up in the ConfigurationModule and because of where the server lives I can't use Update-Help. There's also no "link" section in the help to point to a technet article. Anyone know where the MS documentation is on this? 

Honestly, the short answer is that you need to switch to Intel nics. Broadcom has been trying to fix this problem for over a year and they still haven't licked it. Avoid Networking Issues Hyper V Virtual machines lose network connectivity when you use Broadcom That second link brings you to a Microsoft site which will link you out again to driver pages that supposedly fix this problem. Speaking from personal experience, for what that's worth, it didn't work. We ended up buying Intel Nics and switching them on maintenance. 

Remember, as a powershell professional your code should be as easily read as possible. As with all professional writing, style matters. Also, you should look into using for using username/passwords so you're not writing them in plain text. 

None of the properties there appear to map to any tickets (run a gm on it too). Granted, this could be ignorance on my part and the method to produce the tickets just isn't aptly named or described. I've tried looking at the SMlets source code to glean some insight, but I'm not a C# developer so some of it goes over my head. I've also tried to get some understanding and help from the msdn page for EnterpriseManagementObject Class, but to no avail. Hopefully there's a really simple solution to this and I'm just over thinking it. But, how do you get the Affected User for a SCSM ticket using powershell? Preferably a service request ticket. 

I have a Cisco branded Emulex LightPulse LPE12002 in a Cisco UCS server running Ubuntu 14.04, and I am trying to connect to about 15TB of remote storage configured for it. I don't know where to start, but here's what I have done. First, when I issue , I get a result like the following. 

Every guide to using SSSD for LDAP authentication I've found thus far shows you how to do more than just authenticate a user, such as provide their shell, groups, etc. I don't know how to remove those features without things breaking because there are several moving parts like SSSD, PAM, and NSS. Due to limitations on what information is provided via LDAP (it's not AD), only authentication of users can be done. There isn't even a uid available because the only id provided via LDAP are consistently formatted alpha-numeric strings (won't work on linux). Basically, how can SSSD be configured on Ubuntu to treat ldap as the "shadow" database, but get the uid, groups, and shell from your local system databases (passwd, group). This is currently done with libpam-ldap, but my understanding is there are better alternatives like libpam-ldapd and sssd, the latter of which RHEL has moved to. If I had to guess, it can be done similarly to how we currently do it, which is nss will check local databases first, and if the user doesn't have a shadow file entry, check ldap. As a summary, if I can use SSSD or, as a backup, libpam-ldapd, to authenticate the following way: uid -> /etc/passwd authenticate -> ldap shell -> /etc/passwd groups -> /etc/group Even better if it's possible to stop users from creating passwords locally that would end up in /etc/shadow thus causing it to check ldap at all in future login attempts. Also, all local and service accounts shouldn't be impacted, and ldap authenticated users can be determined with simple regex. I'll be very grateful for any good suggestions on how to handle this. Thanks! 

multiple reboots verified the lpfc driver is loaded None of these seem to work for creating a usable device. I am not using multipath currently, even though it is a 2 port FC card, I am just testing with one port connected and with exposed storage. Any ideas?
