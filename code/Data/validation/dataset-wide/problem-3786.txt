Ivy does not appear to be a common term in mathscinet. Integrable vector Young functions are called IVY-functions in MR2055989 and related papers. Otherwise all occurrences are the plant or a person. 

I could not generalize Robin Chapman's argument to finite abelian groups, since one no longer has that finite Z/nZ[t] modules are direct sums of cyclic modules (for instance, Z[t]/(4,tt-1) has the ideal (2,t+1)/(4,tt-1) of type C2 × C4 with t=A acting as the matrix [1,2;0,1]. This module is non-cyclic and indecomposable. Of course t has a regular orbit, but I could not simply choose a "generator". Marty Isaacs has shown me how to use Horoševskiĭ's argument to reduce to the case where G is indecomposable, where presumably it is easier than I think. 

Frobenius reciprocity for Brauer characters is a little more complicated (a lot more complicated if you don't have complete tables). You need the projective characters to compute the multiplicities. I don't use anything special about the character being induced, though sometimes you can leverage that information (especially if you don't have complete tables). In GAP, this is easily done: 

For $K\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ compact, let $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)$ denote the space of smooth functions on (an open neighborhood of) $K$ with compact support contained in $K$ with the usual Fréchet space subspace topology inherited from $C^{\infty}(K)$, and denote by $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)^*$ the dual with the Mackey topology (or, equivalently, the strong polar topology). For $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ open, let $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)$ denote the LF-space of smooth functions with compact support contained in $U$, and denote by $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)^*$ the space of generalized-functions on $U$, again, with the Mackey topology (or equivalently the strong polar topology). If $K\subseteq U$, we have extension-by-zero maps $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)\rightarrow C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)$, and we thereby obtain restriction maps $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)^*\rightarrow C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)^*$. 

What I have in mind is the following: a (sequence of) functor(s) $K_\bullet$ on the category of topological $^*$-algebras (with values in the category of commutative groups) that satisfies (among other properties one would wish a $K$-theory functor to possess) (i) $K_\bullet (A)=K_\bullet ^{\text{op}}(A)$ when $A$ is a $C^*$-algebra and (ii) $K_\bullet (A)=K_\bullet ^{\text{alg}}(A)$ when $A$ has involution the identity and the discrete topology. As a matter of fact, a quick skim of the construction of $K_0^{\text{op}}(A)$ (as the grothendieck group of unitary equivalence classes of projections in $M_\infty (A)$) seems as if would work verbatim for an arbitrary topological $^*$-algebra, and furthermore, would give the same definition in the case of involution the identity and the discrete topology (this uses the fact that if self-adjoint elements are conjugate, then they are in fact unitarily equivalent). (I suppose one possible issue with extending this to the higher $K$-groups in the most obvious way is determining the 'right' topology to put on the tensor product of topological $^*$-algebras in order to define the suspension.) Does there exist such an extension? If not, why not? If so, is there a reference? 

Cholesky update Rank one updates, chol(A) to chol(A+xx*), are easy and safe. Rank one "downdates", chol(A) to chol(A-xx*), are easy but require a little care: stable algorithms are given in Stewart's Matrix Algorithms Vol 1, Algorithm 4.3.8, p. 347. Chapter 12.5 of Golub–Van Loan has some similar stuff, and Cholesky down-dating in 12.5.4. This function has been widely implemented, and the cholupdate command in matlab dates back to 1979 code from LINPACK. [0,B*;B,0] is a sum of rank one matrices, and so by updating and downdating those rank one guys, you could probably get what you want, and it might even be faster than chol(Q). However, it can be a lot better to update more ranks at a time. Apparently this is a common request in machine learning, and M. Seeger wrote a technical report on this problem of low rank updates to a Cholesky factorization, and mentions several common pitfalls, especially as regards to actually doing it with existing software. A more scholarly (and older) treatment is in section 3 of this article version of Ch. 12.5 of GvL: Gill, P. E.; Golub, G. H.; Murray, W.; Saunders, M. A. "Methods for modifying matrix factorizations." Math. Comp. 28 (1974), 505–535. MR343558 DOI:10.2307/2005923 Davis and Hager in MR1824053 note that algorithm C1 can be used for a reasonably efficient, multiple rank, single pass, update of a dense matrix (and go on to describe sparse techniques). Note that these mostly do not take advantage of the block structure of [0,B*;B,0], so you might find something better that is more specialized. 

For what it's worth, the motivation is that this colimit is the usual definition of the sheaf on a not-necessarily-open subset $K$ (or if you like, the global sections of the inverse image sheaf under the inclusion $K\hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$), and so it would be nice if this colimit had a relatively concrete description. 

If $x:\Lambda \rightarrow X$ is a net in a topological space $X$ and $\Lambda '\subseteq \Lambda$ is a cofinal subset of the directed set $\Lambda$, then $x|_{\Lambda '}$ is a subnet of $x$. We call subnets of this form strict subnets. Of course, not all subnets are of this form, and indeed, the definition of a subnet is chosen the way it is in part so that certain theorems we would like to be true are in fact true. I am in particular curious about the following standard theorem. 

The version of the Baire Category Theorem I have in mind is the statement that a countable intersection of dense open subsets of a complete metric space is dense. The question is: is it likewise true that the countable intersection of dense open subsets of a complete uniform space is dense? A look at the proof suggests that the answer should be no---it makes crucial use of the fact that the canonical uniform structure on a metric space is generated by the $\varepsilon$-balls of radius $\frac{1}{m}$ for $m\ \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. I thus started looking at complete topological groups that were not first-countable for a counter-example, with no luck (topological groups because they provide easy examples of uniform spaces, and not first-countable because first-countable topological groups have uniformities generated by a countable collection of covers (and also because (I think?) first-countable topological groups are metrizable).) Surprisingly, a quick Google search only pulled up one source that seems to mention this at all---Joshi in his Introduction to General Topology states (pg. 363) 

This paper indicates the difficulty of any classification of torsion-free abelian groups with commutative endomorphism rings, as Corner has shown that very large torsion-free abelian groups can have commutative endomorphism rings (while the classifications up to now have basically been "only very small ones"). 

The answer to (1) is yes, primitivity can be checked in O(n^3) time and practical computer implementations have been widely available for decades. See Butler's Fundamental Algorithms for Permutation Groups p.76 for this and various related algorithms (such as testing transitivity) explained in a friendly manner. Holt et al.'s Handbook of Computational Group Theory also contains this material in textbook form. GAP contains open-source implementations of most of the algorithms mentioned (for instance IsTransitive and IsPrimitive would be useful). The answer to (2) is usually yes, since proper primitive groups do not tend to contain many k-cycles. You are just looking for what are called "giant tests" that can be applied to your restricted setting. Some old theorems of Jordan can be used for this in ways that are described in Seress's Permutation group algorithms, especially 10.2.1 and 10.2.2. These are refined to give probabilistic runtime estimates, some of which you could probably use if your black box had a (vaguely) known probability distribution. See also Holt's textbook and GAP's DoSnAnGiantTest. Section 3.3 of Dixon–Mortimer's book also contains results which can be used (with other results) to rule out "small" k. In some ways this is done in section 5.3 and 5.4: if k is smaller than √n, then G contains the alternating group. Be careful about your guarantee in (2). In particular, can you tell if H is transitive and primitive from the graph? If you are only gathering information from the group G, then be careful that G may not be transitive even if H is (where G is generated by all of the elements of H that happen to be cycles). 

I have recently been interested in studying an extension of 'usual' algebraic geometry to take into account the topology of $R$ in the definition of the affine scheme $\mathrm{Spec}\, (R)$ when the ring comes equipped with a given topology. For example, I am curious to investigate schemes over $C ^\infty (\mathbb{R}^d)$, where it is obvious from the beginning that it would be 'wrong' to ignore the canonical Fréchet space topology (for example, the 'correct' definition of $\mathrm{Spec}\, (R)$ in this case should probably be the collection of all closed prime ideals). (Part of the motivation for this is, in the spirit of Grothendieck's famous quote, to replace a bad category of only good objects (the smooth category) with a good category containing some bad objects.) I can't imagine that people haven't investigated things like this before. On the other hand, I don't know what this subject would be called, and so I don't know where to begin looking to read up on the subject. Could someone help point me in the right direction? 

To help searching: ω(|G|) = |π(G)|, and I see the latter usually. A finite simple group G with |π(G)| = 1 must be cyclic of order p. By Burnside's paqb theorem, if |π(G)|=2, then G is not simple. The finite simple groups with |π(G)| = 3 were handled in several specific cases are handled by Brauer, Herzog, Klinger, Leon, Mason, Thompson, and Wales. In particular, it is now known any such group is one of the eight groups listed by Leon–Wales (1974), but this was not known as late as 1976. An important technique is to consider the list of minimal simple non-abelian groups as classified by Thompson in his N-groups papers. This narrowed the problem down to {2,3,p}-groups, and indeed p had only a few possibilities. Brauer, Leon, and Wales applied character theoretic techniques to classify such groups, and Klinger, Mason, and Thompson used local group-theoretic methods. The finite simple groups with |π(G)| = 4 may have been classified by Cao. With the benefit of the classification, one has explicit order formulas for each finite simple group. Unfortunately, the prime factorizations of these formulas can be very difficult to understand. From the review of Bugeaud–Cao–Mignotte (2001), it appears that we probably have the complete list of groups, but that we may not have the proof of this in my lifetime (just due to silly things like Fermat and Mersenne primes). In particular, I believe that it is not yet proven that there are only finitely many groups with |π(G)| = 4. I would guess that effectively the answer to your 2nd question then is: 

Looking at the proof, I definitely see where it would no go through if we were restricted to strict subnets, and it seems as if there would be no easy way to fix this with this restriction. Of course, this doesn't mean that it can't be proven---maybe we just haven't been clever enough to figure out how to do it with only strict subnets? I am quite confident this is not actually the case, however, and that there is indeed a counter-example. Kelley presents an example (pg. 77 of his General Topology, attributed to Arens) that is meant to demonstrate why strict subnets are not enough. He presents an example of a net with a cluster point to which no subnet converges. Unfortunately, the example he gives is Lindelöf, but not quasicompact (and personally, I could live with nets not having subnets converging to cluster points (this is already the case for limit points, for example)). So then, is there a well-known example of a quasicompact space and a net with no convergent strict subnet? 

The higher dimensional Heisenberg groups are the matrix groups G(V,R,f) = { [ 1, x, z ; 0, 1, y ; 0, 0, 1] : x,y in V, z in R } where V is an R-module, R is a ring, and f is an alternating R-bilinear form on V. Typically V is a free R-module, and R is a field or the integers, and f is a block diagonal matrix with blocks [0,1;-1,0]. Sometimes V is just called a symplectic space over R. The group has a normal series 1 ≤ ⟨ z: z in R ⟩ ≤ ⟨ y,z : y in V, z in R ⟩ ≤ G. This gives a very nice presentation of the group as ⟨ x,y,z : [x,y] = f(x,y), [x,z] = [y,z] = 1 ⟩ where the relations from V (for various "x", and also for various "y") and R (for various "z") are implicitly added. For instance taking V free of rank 2 over R=Z, you get ⟨ x1, x2, y1, y2, z : [ x1, y1 ] = [ x2, y2 ] = z, [ x1, x2 ] = [ y1, y2 ] = [ z, x1 ] = [ z, x2 ] = [ z, y1 ] = [ z, y2 ] = [ x1, y2 ] = [ x2, y1 ] = 1 ⟩. This is a very pretty presentation, but is not usually "free". Way too many things commute. However, these types of groups are very important. When R=Z/pZ, these are the extra-special groups of exponent p. Rather than "free products" they are "central products". These form reasonably nice examples of just-non-abelian groups, since V can be a fairly arbitrary R-module as long as R is Z/pZ.
