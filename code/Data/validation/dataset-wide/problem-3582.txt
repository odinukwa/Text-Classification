A lot of development will come from just working with progressively bigger weights, but if you really want something specific, check this list out. 

These things take time, don't worry about it. If you are consistent you will see results, but plan to evaluate at least every few months, not weeks. If you have difficulty maintaining your motivation, join a class, that really helps a lot. You don't want to give up on holding that position when the person next to you is still doing it (even though they are probably thinking the same about you). Also, even if you fail to hold it for the given time, don't just give up. Let's say you have to do 30 seconds and collapse after 10. No problem, relax for a few seconds and then go at it again. You will fail in five. Relax, try again. Keep pushing yourself until the proper time expires. Of course this goes for resistance exercises. Don't try to push yourself on stretches too much, that's a guaranteed way to injure yourself. You should feel tolerable discomfort, not agonizing pain. But really...the class will help. Also some exercises seem simple, but there's a subtle catch to them where the instructor can help you a lot. 

I also agree with what was said about that article not being serious or backed-up by science, but I just want to add that if you are feeling hungry just from cutting down on the meat, you might also want to watch the other aspects of your diet. Energy should come from carbs and/or fat, make sure you are getting enough of that as well. You don't want to be burning protein for energy. 

Indeed the question is quite general.. but I'll try to answer with general problems as well. Muscle imbalance can be a problem if you train incorrectly. For example, if you focus a lot on push-type movements (pecs, triceps, front delts), as would be specific in a striking sport, but don't work pull-type movements as well (back, biceps, rear delts), this will create a strength imbalance. Also similar is training the abs very hard if the lower back is ignored, that can also lead to some serious problems. I think not training your core well enough can be a problem as well. As you get stronger, bigger and faster you want to make sure that your body can keep up. 

I'd propose biking, as most 'How much calories do I burn with...?'-lists claim that (depending on intensity) it burns 600~1200 per hour. This is about as much as running (again depending on intensity), but much more scalable and much less exerting, at least for me. On the one side, you can bike for short periods of time with a very high intensity. Provided you can keep up 30km/h for half an hour, you'd burn up to 600kcal in that time, making it very time-efficient. If you can only keep the speed up for a short time, interval training would be an option. It doesn't burn as much calories initially, but the excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (commonly referred to as afterburn) will compensate for that. On the other side, you can bike slowly for hours on end, enabling you to easily burn 1000kcal (or more) per day, while keeping exertion relatively low. This is incredibly scalable as you can just alter the duration, speed, ride some hills etc. to adjust it to your schedule and/or goals. Also, biking is an 'eccentric-less' exercise, which keeps muscle tear and wear to a minimum. You also don't have the impact of every single step shaking your joints, as you'd have with running, making this a much healthier alternative. Some other alternatives that might require additional equipment would be cross-trainers, rowing or swimming. All of these are highly scalable and you can also do interval training with them. 

Notice how the neutral position works all the muscles already. So if you don't feel like either your lower or upper chest needs some extra work to get rid of disbalances, there's no need to do all of these exercises, as some bodybuilders might suggest. Note that you could also use different grip width, or an inverted grip to achieve similar effects without a variable bench. 

Some final words on to nutrition (as that seems to be a problem, too). You say you want to build mass, but only gained 3kg in 6 months, which can only mean one thing: You're eating waaaaay to little. Some possible reasons for that: 

I have an old problem with my knee from mountain biking and I am also terribly bad at running. As a result, running never really worked out for me. My knee would hurt making the whole experience sour. This also applied for treadmills. When I did various martial arts I would run barefoot in the gym during the workouts and I was surprised to see that my knee didn't bother me at all. So I bought myself a pair of those Vibrams and started running outdoors with them. Impressions: 

I'm not sure how you would research this :) You would have to have a group train, for example, only pecs (and no lats) for a long enough time to observe this phenomenon; the duration is problematic, not to mention convincing someone to do it. Then I feel it's also not really 100% ethical since as a researcher in the field you would probably be aware that intentionally creating a strength imbalance increases the risk of injury. As far as less scientific evidence, I've seen a lot of talk about this problem of having much stronger pecs than lats for example, so I feel that this invalidates the theory, since it describes a completely opposite situation (that of unwanted strength imbalance) as being very prevalent. I am presenting this as anecdotal, but I am fairly certain that there is some medical and scientific work to support this. Finally, I think that what applies at their level (Arnold etc.) is not necessarily applicable for the general population. When you are Arnold's size (I'm of course thinking of him during the years in which he was competing), there are probably tons of little details like this that you can observe, because you've already grown so much and are now trying to push your body even more. Finally, I feel like this doesn't really answer your question and I'm sorry for that, but I guess that what I am trying to say it that I'm not sure if it can be answered :) I hope at the very least that my answer can be a good start for more discussion. 

Why does he change his hours of sleep depending on the season? By sleeping 8-9 hours in the off-season, Jay Cutler is somewhere in the "long sleepers" range according to this poster. Is he putting on unnecessary fat as the poster says or does the poster only apply to sedentary people? 

Machines are the most stable. They work a major muscle and neglect the the small stabilizer muscles. On the other end of the spectrum, you have dumbbells which require a fair amount of stabilizer muscles. One is not better than the other. It all depends on what your goals are. Below, we have the advice of the most successful bodybuilders saying that both stable and unstable equipment are necessary for growth. Dexter Jackson 2008 Mr. Olympia on choosing the right equipment 

When you have diarrhea, what portions of the food is excreted? Does only the poisoned portions become excreted or do the whole stomach contents get excreted? Here is a practical example: For your post workout shake, you blend whey protein with milk. You did not know the milk was expired. After drinking the shake, you get a stomach ache and have diarrhea. What exactly was excreted in the diarhea? Did only the milk get excreted and not the whey? Or did both get excreted? In the latter case, one would need to eat more protein, but in the former case, you don't need to worry because the protein is still in your system. 

Which bodybuilder should I believe? Jay Cutler is a far more successful bodybuilder than Hunter Labrada because Jay has been Mr. Olympia 4 times, but both guys look much better than I'd ever hope to be. 

We have tons of squat variations to work the quadriceps and glutes, but I've never seen a free weight exercise to really work the hamstrings. It seems like hamstring isolation is only possible on a leg curl machine. Machines don't work the stabilizer muscles, so a free weight variation would be more complete. 

Since you seem to have more of a longterm motivation problem, I'll focus on building a base motivation. The examples I give are diet related, as that's what I'm working on right now. They do apply to training (and all other things) as well, though. Goal Setting: First of all, to make a lasting difference you need a goal to work towards. If you don't have a goal, then why do it anyway? So, before setting your goal you need to know some important rules of goal setting. Make it measurable: While "Looking good" and "being healthy" might in effect be your goal, they're weak ones to strive for. There's absolutely no way to know how far off you still are, so you wouldn't know your progress. A better goal would be "to lose 20lbs". This gives you a concrete goal to strive for, a number that you can measure. Other good goals would be "to be able to bench press 100lbs", "Completely eliminate soda from my diet" etc. Just make sure there's a way to definitely say when you've reached your goals. Set a deadline: So "losing 20lbs" is a measurable goal, but it doesn't really hold you accountable. After all, if you reach that goal in 2 months or 6 months is not really an issue. This is why you need a deadline on your goals. "Losing 20lbs until my vacation" would be a much better goal, as you'll really have to work to achieve that goal until your vacation comes up. This deadline will keep you accountable, which'll make it much less likely that you'll skip a workout. Split it up: A great big goal can be very intimidating to reach and the bigger it is the more frustrating the way will be. By splitting goals into smaller sub-goals, you allow yourself to go one step at a time instead of the whole way at once. Let's stay with "Losing 20lbs until my vacation". By setting milestones you can make sure to be on track and split those intimidating 20lbs into smaller portions. By splitting your goal like this, it will become much easier to keep track and really keep at it. 

What is the optimal bulking / cutting rotation schedule for maximum muscle gain and fat loss? By bulking, I mean eating tons and lifting heavy. By cutting, I mean eating less and doing more cardio. Examples of schedules include: At the high frequency extreme: 

Tricep kickbacks help target the upper tricep. Hold the fully extended position for a second or two to target the upper tricep. 

You will burn more calories on the incline than the flat plane, granted that both are set on the same speed. This is because you need to generate an additional [mass * gravity * sin(angle)] newtons to move upward. On a flat plane, the angle is 0; sin(0) = 0, so no force is used to move upward. In conclusion, the incline will work a larger range of muscles. But I don't think the incline is necessarily better than the flat plane. The point of the threadmill is to do cardio, not build muscle. But if the angle is particularly steep, it can be used to increase muscular endurance of those particular listed muscles somewhat. 

Are you supposed to use foam padding on the bar when doing barbell squats? The answer seems inconsistent even from the same professional bodybuilder. I've seen Arnold Schwarzenegger sometimes go bare and at other times use as much padding as a small yoga mat. How can several hundred pounds of pressure on the trapezius be safe and comfortable? I've always found bare barbells unpleasant on the trapezius. Is doing it bare supposed to be beneficial somehow? Padded 

Why does the eccentric contraction increase DOMS, but not the concentric contraction? From the Wikipedia article, it appears that the eccentric contraction uses a very different mechanical process and is fueled by different nutrients. I recall watching a video on Intructional Fitness saying that workouts with extremely prolonged eccentric contractions cause DOMS, not the day after the workout, but actually two days after the workout. Nutrition I'm not an expert on how nutrition affects DOMS, but I've read in numerous places that eating branch chain amino acids reduces DOMS by repairing muscle faster. BCAAs are found in most high end protein powders.
