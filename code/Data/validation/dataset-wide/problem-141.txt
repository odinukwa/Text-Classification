Targeting is also a concern if you want the tank to be a match for a mech which can presumably move and shoot simultaneously - stabilising guns was a big challenge for earlier tanks and a huge advantage when it was cracked. TL;DR - only a few countries on Earth currently make tanks (maybe a dozen or so) and they have free and easy access to their own factories, decades of experience operating the machines and the luxury of long R&D periods. Making tanks isn't easy! Your best bet for a believable reason to have tank vs mech might be if the rebels had a much more unrestricted access to factories, just not necessarily ones making the mechs. An unsupervised heavy-machinery factory along with a plant that can make hardened steel might be your best bet, just need to find them a source of weapons. 

It depends what Joe wants. It is entirely possible that people might notice that something is going on - although depending on the exact mechanism it might be very hard to notice; but if Joe doesn't want anyone to notice then of course he can instantly make that true and it immediately goes away. 

Tie the opinion in to some great event or movement, even in a roundabout way. Putting gravy on chips tends to be a Northern (England) thing. Maybe the hard-line government of the day led to massive strikes in the North, and chips and gravy was an easy and simple food to get to all of the demonstrators and so became associated with the strikes. The movement was later ruthlessly crushed, but chips and gravy was always associated with the movement from then on. Thirty years later the government has tried its hardest to remove all memory of the events, even to the level that no chip shops are allowed to serve gravy. It's just an example of course, but it's easy to see how something innocuous can be tied up with something very serious. 

No. Mass of all of humanity: 4 x 10^11 kg Mass of the moon: 7 Ã— 10^22 kg It's like asking if you could be knocked over by a bacterium (roughly a 11 order of magnitude mass difference too) 

No. Consider the speeds needed for interstellar travel. If you're on a collision course with another vessel, by the time you've seen it you're going to hit it. If you're going to be 'driving' ships around the sky, then you're going to need radars and computers to stop you from crashing into things. 

Why would a mermaid have a blowhole? A blowhole is a cetacean's nose, where as mermaids are generally depicted as having human-like facial features including a nose. Remember that you don't need to tread water in an upright position to breathe, you could also breathe on your back. If mermaids have any different sort of respiratory apparatus to humans, then it's generally depicted as gills. If your mermaid had both though, then the back would probably be the sensible point to maintain a relatively human-like anatomy - the back of the head would also work, but create issues with where the connection would be vs the bits that already live in that part of the anatomy (brain and spinal cord). 

Ultimately special forces soldiers are just soldiers - very good soldiers. They're not supermen. What sort of threat is he under? You don't make it clear, for example, what country he's in. If he's in a tinpot dictatorship, then he can probably pay off the local army to look after him, amd then employ highly-trained, skilled mercenaries to provide his close protection and supervise the locals. If he's in the US, then it's a bit tricky - are the police after him? If they are then he's going to have big issues. Is he in a US-friendly foreign country? What do their government think of him? 

Horse As a rule, guns are expensive and important (and ammunition relatively cheap). If you put a gun on an animal then you will get a single, un-aimed shot from it during a battle which would be a very poor return on your investment. Much better to have the cavalry charge and leave the guns with the infantry, who can aim and re-load them. Or mix the two and have dragoons ride the Centaurs, so that they can be dropped off and operate the guns whilst the Centaurs attack. Centaur As pointed out by others, why not just arm the human half of the Centaur? 

Now assume that there's a 0.01% difference in the progression of vertebrate life-evolution-civilisation-technology on another planet. 0.01% equates to tens of thousands of years - it's bronze- or stone-age technology vs ICBMs, satellites and fifth-generation fighters. In fact, much better to look at it this way - the chances of there being another civilisation at roughly the same technology level as ours are incredibly tiny. We'd easily expect them to be thousands of years different, but they could well be millions of years ahead of us (or behind, of course - but then we'd have to go to them). Humanity hasn't really evolved along a nice, linear timeline from single-cell to high-functioning tool use; there's no particular reason that we couldn't have evolved hundreds of millions of years ago instead, and been millions of years earlier on the timeline. 

Thinking from the alien invasion point of view, I'd want to put it somewhere that's a long way from civilisation and is surrounded by open, barren terrain. Some options would be: 

To be honest, no one really knows. There are plenty of people who've modelled nuclear winters, and they've come up with answers ranging from 'very little happens' to 'pretty much all life on the planet is doomed'. So to some extent, just pick whatever fits your narrative and go with it, there's as much chance of its being right as any other prediction. 

I'm not 100% on the numbers, but the temperature increases by as much as 30K per km of depth. This means that as you descended, by 5km (probably not a huge pressure difference, only half as deep as Everest is high) the temp would be that of an oven. I think that your explorers would be cooked before they had to worry hugely about pressure differences. So the ailment might well be good old heat stroke. 

They use 'The Matrix'. When it comes to public space travel amongst widely varying species, it's very tricky to keep everyone alive with such differing requirements. So where there's going to be a big mix of requirements, they borrow from the ideas of intermodal freight transport. At every space port, there is a large stock of life-support containers, of a number of standard sizes to fit all life forms - each able to create a wide variety of environments for the lifeform inside (and perhaps some specialist containers for really odd species). These can then simply be loaded nice and neatly on to the ship for travel. Where the passengers will mostly be of one species, then the ship would be split between normal passenger travel and a 'cargo' hold for the boxes. Because the boxes are intermodal, there's no need to get out until you reach your destination - boxes can be swapped between connecting flights and stored where there is a gap between flights. These boxes also contain 'The Matrix' (I just came up with that name, don't know why) - a virtual reality system that enables everyone to socialise on board the transports. The communal areas can now of course be as large and luxurious as you like! 

If you want to bring down a helium airship, your best bet is going to be a large explosive charge (or charges) detonated inside the gas envelope. That should both cause overpressure-based rupturing of the envelope and force helium out, replacing it with combustion gases (which will be much denser than the helium, at least after they cool). Incendiaries are also well worth considering - it's likely that the Hindenburg's fire was mostly the skin of the airship, and not the hydrogen inside. How you create a delayed charge with 1850's tech is another matter; but it's not impossible as shrapnel shells existed in those days. Given the thin skin of the airships, the complex nature of the munitions and the need to lift the weapons using an airship (giving significant weight restrictions) relatively low-velocity weapons would be the way forward - think howitzer (or even rocket, if they can get the accuracy up to an acceptable level) rather than cannon. If you want to attack surface targets, then bombs would be the way forward. Ground-based air defence would still need cannon, in order to achieve sufficient altitude. 

There are two very good reasons why tanks have never (successfully) grown to more than 70-odd tonnes. 

What time are we thinking about? My thoughts regarding weaponry would be the following, as you move through history: The bow and arrow (and related weapons) would be king for much longer than in our world. Artillery would probably consist of large bows and catapults; the catapults would become increasingly deadly with the advent of explosive payloads. Rockets would likely develop a little faster as weapons due to a lack cannons. The really big revolution though would come with the advent of higher-technology plastics. With the likes of carbon fibre and kevlar, guns as we know them (albeit rather more expensive) would start to become possible - and probably create a sudden leap in lethality, as any civilisation able to make such plastics wouldn't be starting at the musket but straight in at modern weapons. However, how long it would take humanity to successfully make plastics in the absence of metals is a much more complex question, I'd certainly imagine that it would be a lot slower. Could the industrial revolution happen at all without metal?
