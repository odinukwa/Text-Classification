Edit : Of all the movies I've ever seen so far, The Congress is the one I know that is close to "Waking Life" and "A Scanner Darkly" (that other animated masterpiece by Linklater) both from an audiovisual perspective and from a philosophical perspective. 

This process has proven to be more reliable than any other means of discovering the truth about the objective universe we live in. What Tyson was trying to say, is that truth as discovered by means of the scientific method is objectively true, no matter how many people may disbelieve in it. Science is agnostic with respect to what you or I believe. The evidence and proven empirical methods of interpreting that evidence are the only things that matter in science. Tyson by no means intended to say that scientists cannot make mistake or that science in its current form does not contain mistakes. Of course it does. However, the scientific method is a self-correcting process, which means that every single scientific theory is constantly tested and retested and replaced by a better theory when new rests lead to different conclusions. This is where we find the main difference between science based opinions and faith based opinions. Faith is based on dogma, whereas science allows no dogma. The scientific method requires that all cognitive dissonance is systematically eliminated wherever one ends up with conflicting theories or data-sets. 

So, the main difference between an Atheist and a Theist is not that an Atheist doesn't believe in "the Numinous", but rather the Atheist's reluctance to call it "God", because the word "God" is too laden with Jewish, Christian and Islamic notions the Atheist doesn't relate to. Yet, "the Numinous" is the very core of what Theists refer to as "God", in pretty much any religion that uses the term "God" : 

Existence has different meanings for different things. There's no trivial test to assess the existence of a rock and an equation. This answer is based on my current writings, you can check profile for references and a draft for a theory of interaction. Check also solipsism and George Berkeley. Therefore a good approach (the best, although a bit difficult to grasp for most people) is related to the systems theory: systems are subjectively-defined sets of things with inputs and output channels. If you exite an input channel, you get an output content, following a causal mechanism. That is called interaction, being you the subject and the chair the object. The systems theory would glob an equation and a chair as plain systems. So, if you push the chair (input energy to it), it moves (its atoms distribute such energy, and output kinetic energy). That's a system for you. But if there's a pillow attached to the chair, you will also move it: in such case, your definition of chair includes the pillow. But if you want to sell it perhaps you will remove the pillow. Now, your definition of chair is absolutely different. Then, it is you that define what is the chair depending on the interaction. In other words, existence is subjective. The subject (you) defines what is the object depending on the interaction. What is a tree? Is water part of it? You define it depending on the interaction. What is a cloud? You the subject defines it. The boundaries of a cloud for you will always be different than those detected by a weather satellite. Therefore, what you say is completely right: an object system (a thing) has no physical boundaries. It is the subject that defines the object depending on the interaction. It exists for you if you can interact with it (take into account that Einstein exists for you due to he interacted with some people, and some chain of interaction reached you, carrying the information about his existence). But if you discard the information, and since he's not able to interact with you, he doesn't exist. Then, existence is subjective. There's no such thing as objectivity, except as a communication ideal. 

So if time = awareness = clock ticks, I can't distinguish between those two statements. Conceptually they mean exactly the same. The disconnect between Atheists and Theists largely stems from using very different semantical contexts to really describe the same perspective. If we were to adjust our semantics more to each other, many of us might see more similarities than they ever held possible. 

The movie "Waking Life" is a philosophical masterpiece: a quasi non-narrative psychedelic dreamscape exploring the very nature of both existence and non-existence in unpredecented depth. In a sequence of seemingly unrelated dialogues, the film addresses anything from the nature of love and death to the paradox of free will, starring three philosophy professors (Louis Mackey, Robert Solomon & David Sosa) and several other contemporary philosophers (Eamonn Healy, Aklilu Gebrewold, Caveh Zahedi, Timothy "Speed" Levitch, ...), summarizing the best of European, Asian and African philosophy alike. Waking Life is by far my favorite movie; and I can't think of even a single movie that comes remotely close to the philosophical depth that I find in Waking Life. Can you? Or to phrase it differently: can you recommend any movies similar to Waking Life? 

This is a logical fallacy. It's called an argumentum ad populum. All of Alice's statements are in fact a mere repetition of the same logical fallacy. For Bob and Alice to settle the argument with logic, Alice will first have to acknowledge that her argument is fallacious. Then, she'll have to listen to the arguments Bob has for his position and look for fallacies or other errors in those arguments. Then, Alice should provide her counter-arguments against Bob's arguments. Bob should listen to those arguments and look for errors in those. Then, Bob should counter those counter-arguments with counter-counter-arguments. etc. Alice and Bob should continue this process of each coming up with counter-arguments against the arguments of the other until one of them no longer is capable of providing any counter-arguments. The person who is incapable of finding any flaws in the arguments of the other and therefore of providing valid counter-arguments is the person who loses the argument. Alternatively, you may come to a point where you feel that this process is too tedious or where you realize that both of you simply don't have sufficient data to back up your claims. In that case, you agree to disagree. 

This kind of rhetoric formulations is just a misleading fallacy. Verbs needing a subject is only human reason about acting over an object. Nothing is an ideal representation of the lack of existence, as the number zero. An action requires an object. The action lacks of sense without an object. Can you cut nothing? Can you wash nothing? Can you plant zero seeds? Not possible. Imagining nothing has no logic as well. 

The word love leads to multiple misunderstandings because it is wide and fuzzy but basically implies attraction. From the perspective of the systems theory: physical attraction occurs between two entities, and it is generated by two forces, one from each entity towards each other. This means that for attraction to exist, there should be a force between entity 1 towards entity 2 and vice versa. The same occurs with emotional attraction: it occurs between two individuals, and the word love describes such complex attraction. Sex is just one type of attraction, and there are others. In consequence, love implies sexual attraction. Now, from the perspective of each subject, let's observe both forces: 

We are destroying the planet. At certain point, we will be forced to stop reproducing and perhaps we will be killed due to the lack of resources (e.g. Donald Trump will not hesitate to shoot people from shitty countries). But such solution will be coercitive, not voluntary. Now, before reaching such point, is the time to think about the voluntary options. From an ethical point of view, should I choose to live or to die in this current context, so I stop consuming resources and allow others to persist on this planet? (naturally, I wish to live; but I need to get a philosophical / ethical approach, if I should die for others, including Trump, to persist, and perhaps in order to create laws allowing people to die voluntarily in order for others to survive. Or if a voluntary option is not allowable, and why) 

You cannot conclude based on propositions (1) and (2) that Sven has a mustache. Drawing that conclusion based only on those two propositions would be a logical error. However, it just happens to be the case that Sven has a mustache. 

The boy explicitly asked for a chocolate cake. His implicit wish might have been for any cake that could fix his craving. Explicit wishes / questions and implicit wishes / questions don't always correspond pefectly, as illustrated by your example. 

Ted Kaczynski, also known as the “Unabomber,” was born on May 22, 1942, in Illinois. A mathematics prodigy, Kaczynski taught at the University of California at Berkeley before retreating to a survivalist lifestyle in the Montana woods. Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski mailed bombs to universities and airlines, killing three people and injuring 23 more. FBI agents arrested Kaczynski in 1996, and two years later he was sentenced to life in prison. Kaczynski saw something in technology that caused him to lash out with violence. He was able to articulate that what that "something" was with surprising clarity in a sprawling, infamous 35,000-word manifesto titled "Industrial Society and its Future" (click me for the unabridged text of "Industrial Society and its Future"). In meticulous, scholarly precision, Kaczynski makes his primary claim that “freedom and technological progress are incompatible,” and that therefore technological progress must be undone. Kaczynski ’s argument basically goes like this: 

Faith = prejudice = belief without justification. Knowledge = a consistent body of data and logic. Belief can involve either faith of knowledge, depending on the justification of that belief. To quote Nietzsche: 

From a existentialist perspective, all tastes, all values, norms, all standards, all morality is inherently subjective and arbitrary to a point. From a existentialist perspective, the only meaning there is to life is the meaning that you as an individual adhere to it. The only morals there are to life, are the subjective and largely arbitrary morals that you as an individual choose to adhere to. The only goals in life are the goals you set for yourself. It essentially means that life is yours to create! 

If the war is declared by a legitimate authority, then it ought to have the backing of those who wish to give up their civil liberties - if only in a representative way. If the ends are proportional to the means, then it would have to be worse for the citizenry to not give up their civil liberties than to do so. In another sense, all the principles for just war theory must be found true just for the war to be declared, so they all come in to play and they are all very hard to satisfy. 

There is a contradiction if the distinction isn't made between the death penalty as a form of punishment or as a necessary means of protecting society. The former, is indefensible if juxtaposed with the belief in a right to life and the latter, in any society capable of producing prisons keeping inmates in near complete isolation, is nearly never the case. The reason killing as a form of punishment is not justified by one who adopts the 'right to life' philosophy is that it doesn't protect any other peoples lives. The personalistic norm of John Paul II says a person is an entity towards which the only proper way to relate is love. The notion of 'doing unto others as they would do unto you' could be used to justify the death penalty is thrown out the door when you consider the personalistic norm, as do many prolifers. The personalistic norm doesn't mean surrender yourself or your family to invaders who want to kill you, when any notion of 'proper relations' has gone out the door. The reason killing as a form of punishment is accepted as a plank of the Republican Party is that it is a tough way to deal with crime. That's not very philosophical or wise. People often conflate these two very different ideas, but I'd like to hope we're moving away from the death penalty (and life sentences) altogether. 

So, can it be artificial? If so, that would be fantastic, and really able to be understood as intelligent. But there is more: individual existence can conflict with society, there is where moral enters the game: 

As you and me 1) know the causality mechanism, and 2) agree about it, finding a proof is making a causal relationship between a cause and a consequence. Then, we can agree that sunlight makes plants grow (causal rule: sunlight-over-a-plant => plant-grows). Then, we can set a system plant, send the sunlight input (cause or action) and verify growth (reaction). Finding the system that relates action to reaction, or finding specific exceptional reactions can be difficult. But sometimes we find them and agree and reach a proof. 

If entropy=chaos, entropy decreases with time. If entropy=membership of a small group of states [see: Daniel Styer, insight into entropy], then, entropy also tends to decrease: small groups happen more often. If entropy=energy dissipation, the same. If particles exert rejection towards others, entropy grows with time. If particles exert attraction, entropy decreases with time. In addition, energy is a subjective concept. An object that is heat for a subject (and therefore can exert work) can be cold for another (not being able to exert work), so energy dissipation becomes a subjective approach. 

In order to discuss with religious friends about god, I would like to know if there's some accepted objective definitions of God for main religions, even if belief is subjective. For example, is he "a person who..."? In that case I would address features of a person, as capabilities and limitations. Is he "an entity..."? In that case I would use systems theory. I feel lost on this, being agnostic from a religious family, where I was taught that God is a mess of things, including a beautiful bearded face, omnipotence and a mix of human defects and metaphysical powers.
