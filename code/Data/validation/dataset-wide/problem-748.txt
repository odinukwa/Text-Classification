I converted my '96 Gary Fisher Alfresco to a budget 1x7. I simply removed the front derailer, kept the original Sugino chain rings and a Shimano hyperglide 7 speed cassette. The only problem is that my chain falls off the chainring frequently. The front derailleur helps to keep your chain on the chainrings. There are chain guards available that help to keep the chain on the chainrings. The chainrings on a 3x or 2x group set are designed to allow a chain to move off the chainring while shifting, but a 1x chain ring is designed to hold on to the chain. If you go the 1x route, be sure to get a 1x chain ring. It sounds like this is your plan. 

I have used boiled linseed oil on two steel bikes, one of which I ride daily through the slushy winters and flooded springs of lower Michigan. The linseed lays down a gel like coating that does a pretty good job of preventing rust. I had a can of linseed oil from a woodworking project, and decided to give it a try on my frames. JP Weigle Framesaver is easier to apply, so linseed oil has only three advantages: its cheaper, it smells great, and it is pretty classy. It may or may not be more environmentally friendly. To apply, strip your bike down to its frame. The only part I left on the frame was the headset. You will want to remove the fork and its bearings, and protect the headset cups and races with masking tape. Pour the linseed into the frame and slowly rotate the frame to ensure all of the tubes are coated. I usually rotate for about 5 minutes, and then place the frame on its side. I usually do two or three applications before reassembling the bike. Be sure to clean off any oil on the exterior of the frame before it starts to cure, but it can be cleaned off with a degreasing agent. 

In normal conversation, a bicycle is a vehicle because it is a machine used to move people or cargo. From a legal perspective, whether or not a bicycle is considered a vehicle depends on local law. Defenitions are used in laws to develop the scope of a law and in what situations it applies. It might be convenient to have separate definitions for vehicles and bicycles. However, if your local jurisdiction does not consider a bicycle a vehicle, it still may be legal to ride a bike on the road with all the same legal rights and responsibilities as a automobile. For example, in Michigan, bicycles are excluded from being vehicles (Michigan Vehicle Code 257.79) because they are human powered. Bicycles get their own definition in the statute (MVC 257.4). Bikes can still ride on the roads of Michigan with all the same rights (MVC 257.657). It is worth noting that Michigan's definition of a bicycle includes tricycles. Legal definitions don't always match dictionary definitions. 

A collections of thoughts about a few of the questions you've raised. The short answer to the title question is 'yes'. Read further for some specifics. Equipment If you have the budget for multiple new bikes, that's great. However, based on your apparent wants, I'd suggest the 'more serious rode bike' be a cyclocross bike. You can put slicks on a 'cross bike and it is effectively a road bike. You simply put on different tires for when you want to race/train in the mud. Winter and Spring Training If it's in your budget, definitely get a trainer. They are far from exciting, but regular sessions on the trainer through the winter will do wonders for your fitness coming into the spring. For the most part you will want to be riding so that you're sort of breathing deeply, but could still carry on a conversation. There really isn't a whole lot of point to doing anything really painful during this period, other than combat boredom of long winters. If you're into snow sports, cross country skiing is a great way to get/stay fit over the winter that doesn't involve being inside all the time. Spring and Summer Ride lots. Have fun. Listen to your body and get professionally fitted on your new 'cross or road bike, it is surprisingly easy to get injured early in a new sport. You will want to start riding faster every now and then. Find a couple of local routes or hills that you occasionally try to set personal records on. You are new at the sport, so in most places your races will be < 40 minutes. This means you don't need to go out and hammer for 4 hours. (And shouldn't unless you really enjoy this) The only real specific training I'd suggest at this point in time (later summer) is occasionally do things like 20 seconds sprinting, 20 seconds soft pedalling, repeat for several minutes at a time. Take a break for a few minutes then do it again a couple of times. Do this once or at most twice in a week. The major reason I suggest this is because 'cross is extremely stochastic. Unlike road racing (running or cycling), triathlons or most other reasonably common endurance sports, a 'cross race is often 10 seconds flat out, 5 seconds braking and coasting around a hairpin, 30 seconds flat out, get off the bike, run, pedal carefully through an off camber corner, flat out for 15 seconds... You get the idea, but your body needs to experience this a few times before you do it in a race. Technical Skills While I don't think you need to spend huge amounts of time on this early in your career, you also don't want to try this stuff out for the first time in a race. Find a nice park nearby. Find some trees that are close together and try riding in an '8' pattern around them as quickly as you can. Do this in dry and wet conditions. Your bike will slip out from under you eventually. Learn what it feels like just before the bike washes out, this is important. Every race will have a part where you need dismount. Ride for 30 seconds hardish, dismount, run with the bike for 30 seconds, then hop back on and ride again. (Youtube for techniques, I'd suggest not trying the flying remount, it's generally not worth it...) Racing You've practiced, you've been riding for a year, great! Get out there and race. Do at least a lap or two of the course before the race. You want to be pretty warmed up before you start and then just cut loose. A couple of other random points. Due to the hard/coast/hard/coast nature of a cyclocross race, you will almost certainly blow up. This can be a new and exciting experience so you should be aware of it. You will want to get off your bike Right Now and maybe lay down for a while. This is normal. Cyclocross is an endurance event, so you will need to occasionally lower your pace and recover. 

I recently had a cycle stolen, the copper (I'm in England!) who came to take the statement, wasn't at all interested in taking the serial number, he reckoned they're never recovered / returned that way and a photo of it was far more useful. When it was initially stolen, I couldn't find the booklet I'd written the serial number in, so I called the supplier (one of the big online places) and they told me they didn't track serial numbers and there was no way to find it out if I didn't make a note of it. I think they have a lot more to do with security theatre than actual security. It makes us feel like they're less likely to be stolen, without providing any real protection against. 

Almost all stems (aside from a few very expensive carbon ones!) are designed to be mounted either way around. The pressures are in the same direction regardless of which way up it is. (they're just reversed) They are designed to be used either way up, otherwise manufacturers would need to produce double the number of stems to create positive and negatively angled setups. Out of curiosity I've just looked through a range of carbon stems online, and the vast majority of them are of an identical construction to their less exotic counterparts (complete with writing on both sides) There were a couple of stems that integral mounts for computers that didn't seem to be reversible. But by and large, they all appear to be designed to be used either way around. 

The claimed advantage of BB30 is an increase in stiffness and a 4% increase in drivetrain efficiency, achieved through an increase in size allowing larger diameter frame tubes. (according to Cannondale - I don't have the rep to comment!) The Caad10 uses 110 BCD 5 arm chainring, if you put that into your favourite search engine there are a large selection of chainrings that will be compatible. You don't specifically need to replace them with the same size chainring, you can change them depending on your requirements. The Shimano 105 chainrings should be a direct replacement, and are relatively inexpensive. Personally I wouldn't try to straighten an old chainring, as the metal would have stretched and you are unlikely to get it back to being entirely flat. 

I think this is the tip of a major crime wave. We will look back on this as the very first instance of The Great Tube thief. With her cunning and guile she will continue to evade detection as she travels the world stealing inner tubes, willy, and quite literally, nilly. Whether they are beautifully crafted, lightweight sleek handcrafted latex tubes, with long, elegant, smooth presta valves. Or fat, dumpy and heavy butyl ones with dented capless, Schrader valve. She won't care, she'll have the lot. We'll never know what she does with them all, it will be the eternal unsolved mystery of cycling. Just be careful the next time you pull up at the lights, watch out for her ninja like skills. Or before you have chance to pull off before that rogue BMW, your tubes will gone forever... P.S. I do apologise! it seems the urge to write something stupid in this place just overcame me ;) 

Chain/derailleur is on the smallest sprocket. It is positioned fine, no noise. When I press the brake lever inwards to shift the derailleur up, it moves a bit until I can feel the shift cable tightening ever so slightly. The shift lever stops and feels locked at that point. (It will not go through it's full sweep inwards) The thumb lever on the sora shifter feels loose and has no tension. (Normal for when it is on the smallest sprocket) If I pull on the shift cable itself (cable is routed along the top bar of the bike) the derailleur moves smoothly through the gears on the cassette. 

I currently have SPD pedals on all of my bikes. I've stuck with them so far as they worked relatively well and I couldn't justify having two types of shoes. I can justify two types of shoes now. These pedals/shoes/etc would be for my road bike and likely used on the track as I am going to spend a bit of time at the local velodrome this winter. My primary criteria is probably strength, with price second. I'm a sprinter and saving money is always good. Weight doesn't really matter at this point. The Look and Shimano road pedals look good, but they have a number of different models across the board. Any suggestions or ones to stay away from? 

I recently bought a new commuting bike (Norco ccx3) which has mechanical disc brakes (Promax DSK-715 Road Mechanical Disc). Thus far I've been pretty happy with them. In the last couple of commutes, I've noticed an ocasionally 'ting' sound coming from somewhere on the bike when I would hit a bump. This morning I figured out what it was. On the front brake, the pads are a a bit loose in the calipers. That is, the spring clip thing is still in there, but when there is no pressure on the brake cable, the pads can rattle a bit between the caliper and the rotor. With the wheel in, there doesn't appear to be enough room for the pads to slip out and there still is a fair bit of pad left. Is this normal, or is there any danger to this? 

I am looking to purchase a new wheelset in the not too distant future and am debating between wheels that are 58mm and 85mm deep. Or, and this is the part I'm curious about, a hybrid of the two. (58 front, 85 rear) In a crosswind, a deep front wheel will, I believe, have a larger negative effect on stability than a deep rear wheel. My question is regarding this. Since I'm going to have one aero wheelset I'd like them to be able to be used in as wide a range of conditions as possible, within reason of course. Assuming a moderate crosswind situation, which would add more instability, a 58mm front wheel, or an 85mm rear wheel?
