Operating expenses: include rent, equipment, inventory costs, marketing, payroll, insurance and funds allocated toward research and development For EBITDA, I guess you can find it on your own ! 

Because let's say that a firm makes even 1$ profit ... Then another firm can come in a sell the product for only 0.99cts profit ! And so one until the equilibrium is the marginal cost of a product ! 

I agree with @BBKing, just to put it here as an answer: if we go back to your two definitions you can find quiet easily some counter examples. Let's take a firm, which uses a machine as capital. Let's assume also that this machine can only be used by one man at a time. Do you think this machine is a non-excludable / non-rival good ? 

One of the direct consequences of that is that the country is relying on its dollar reserves to pay its imported goods. The country's foreign reserves are already withering at 12-year lows. Venezuela has even paid Switzerland with gold! But the problem is that on the land the demand was still the same and the supply could not follow, which led to a massive inflation. Inflation will surge to 720 percent in 2016 from 275 percent last year, according to a note published by the IMF. The huge outstanding debt is also worrying investors.Creditors are now demanding a high premium for their trust in that promise. The yield on Venezeula’s dollar bond that matures in 2020 is 37% (an investment mainly made by hedge fund). This is the more financial aspect of the question: it's hard or costly for Venezuela to get financial help from investors right now. For this aspects, I encourage you to take a look at this article by The Economist: 

This creates the loan, and it creates money in the form of the matching deposit. When loan capital is repaid, the operation is: 

Yes it can. If debt originates from the banking system, then it potentially has a side effect of money creation. Whether or not money is actually created when a bank loan is made depends on the banking system's regulatory framework, and the lending policies of its banks, and these can vary widely. However if there is net excess of bank lending over bank loan repayment and loan default, then money creation is occurring, and the additional money can and indeed usually does, result in inflation. 

No. The price paid for any item in a market based economy is loosely a direct function of the total quantity of money and an inverse function of all the transactions that that quantity of money is used for. Inflation can consequently arise from 2 separate causes - increases in the total quantity of money, and decreases in the total quantity of production. Owing to the way the banking system operates, the money supply typically increases over time. For example, the USA´s money supply over time looks like this: US M2 Money Supply As the money supply expands, prices increase (inflation), but that´s prices for everything, including labour. So at the point in time when the money supply expansion causes McDonald´s burgers to cost $100, average salaries would have increased to a similar degree. Money hasn´t become worthless, it´s just had a few 0´s tacked on its quantity. If you flip this paragraph around, then the value of money itself, is a function both of its total quantity, and the total amount of economic activity that it is being used as a unit of exchange for. It´s also possible that production could dramatically decrease, for example if harvest failure led to food shortages. In that case, the price could increase to 100 dollars or more, but that would be an indicator of scarcity. Conceivably, a vegetarian dominated government could also legislate beef consumption to be illegal, in which case the black market price could well become $100, in this case reflecting a presumably artificial scarcity. Note though, that this behaviour both of the banking system in expanding the money supply, and the economy in expanding or contracting production does mean that the time value of money is more or less continuously decaying. So in the sense of putting a $100 note under the mattress for a hundred years, then yes, that particular amount of money will become worthless or nearly so, because whatever fraction of the total money supply it was at T, it will be substantially less in T+100 years. 

I was wondering if anyone had an idea about the first author to have mathematically computed an isoquant or at least the first occurrence of a drawn isoquant ? My best guess would be F. Edgeworth in Mathematical Psychics: An Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences (1881) but I really doubt it ! 

As you have pointed out: where it comes from is very important. As to the Japanese situation it is quiet different from the US position from example. In fact most of the Japanese debt is owned by Japanese people (90% of the current debt). More specifically the BoJ plays a big role as a buyer, and puts pressure on Japanese yield, which makes it cheaper for the government to issue bonds ! Another interesting point that is usually left by anlysts: Japan is the biggest creditor in the world. The country holds a net amount of about 3 trillion USD (367 trillion yen) of financial assets through the world, which makes Japan the first creditor worldwide (before China !). An interesting further reading which gives other information on the Japanese debt under stress tests of the IMF (P.40): $URL$ You also might want to read this paper of Rogoff and Reinhart called "Growth in a time of debt": $URL$ . It was really criticized but is a good first glimpse... Afterwards you might want to go a little bit deeper into the debt sustainability analysis of the IMF... Edit 

They don't or shouldn't, fear deflation absolutely. But it's a complicated issue because there are two causes of deflation/inflation. One is changes in the money supply, the other is changes in production. Changes in production that cause prices to fall are beneficial to everybody. Society becomes materially richer, and this is the great economic success of the last 100 years. However, prices will also shrink if the money supply falls, since there is less money to buy things with. That in and of itself wouldn't be such a big problem in a market based environment where prices could adjust up and down. However the one thing that can't adjust its price is debt, debtors have made a commitment to re-payments irrespective of whatever the money supply and deflationary situation is. It depends where you are in the world right now, as to whether the money supply is expanding or contracting. The situation in Greece is particularly problematic: 

There is a lot of controversy in economics about the advisability or otherwise of government taxation and deficits, but let's skip that and just look at the figures. The U.S. National debt held by the public, is approximately \$13.3 trillion. Federal tax revenue for 2014 was slightly over \$3 trillion - which still left a \$500 billion deficit. Interest rates on this debt are at an all time low. Government 30 year treasuries have an interest rate of 1%. This is a steal. However, at the same time, although inflation at the moment is also low, the money supply is continuing to expand at its typical US rate, which is about ~5-7%/annum. Tax revenue over the long term is a function of the total money supply, but since money creation is concentrated in the financial sector, it is not currently being taxed at very high levels - capital gains and dividends for example attract a top tax rate of 20% in the US. So on the one hand, the US government is borrowing at a very attractive rate, on the other, it is not taxing efficiently enough to collect enough in taxes to really take advantage of this. In order to break even, tax revenue would need to increase by ~18%. Any amount above that would eventually result in the debt being completely repaid, it's just a matter of time. Indeed, even if all the government did was balance the books, the progressive growth of the money supply (and accompanying inflation) would over time make the debt negligible. Would this be economically advisable? This is an open research question. The annual cost of the debt (interest payments) is ~\$430 billion. So interestingly, even if the US government didn't have any debt it would still not be breaking even on its current tax revenue.That suggests that at some point in the future, as in a couple of years after interest rates rise significantly, there will be trouble in store, since the additional interest will significantly add to the deficit. Of course, one way to solve that, would be to tax the recipients of those interest payments (the finance sector for the most part) more appropriately. 

Very interesting question, I'll try to summarize some aspects and I probably won't be exhaustive ! Venezuela has long been a country relying on oil (95% of their exports). Certain experts have estimated that Venezuela holds just shy of 25% of worldwide oil reserves, but the oil extracted in Venezuela is very heavy and hard to refine and then sell to other countries, which makes it more expensive than oil coming for example from Saudi Arabia. When prices boomed, the former President Hugo Chávez, who died in 2013, used oil exports to quadruple the foreign debt. He also led a some nationalisations. The main factor for Venezuela's current crisis is therefore the counter-shock on oil prices which lowered exports. This quote comes from an FT article 

You have to differenciate the debt that is already existing from the one that is going to be issued: whenever the US Treasury issue a bond lets say a 10% coupon 10yrs... for a 100USD. It's still going to pay 10USD to the holders during the 10yrs. When you see the yield going up or down it's usually on the secondary market. I say usually because sometimes the government issues bond with a floating rate which can be impacted by a rate increase. As for the new debt that is going to be issued you are right to say that this going to be more costly ! 

The next month, Roger pays another 10 in capital, and pays 5 interest, and gets the interest back in salary. This continues until the loan is repaid. The key concept is that in an economy, money is exchanged and individual units of money are constantly circulating through the economy and being re-used, as in the example above. It's a flow system essentially, and this applies to interest payments just as much as payments for food, etc. Money in a fractional reserve monetary system today also predominantly takes the form of liability bank accounts, rather than physical currency, and most banking operations these days operate as transfers from bank account to account. The writers who concentrate on physical currency in describing this system seem to miss this point, and consequently get key points incorrect. This doesn't mean that there isn't a very challenging accompanying inflation problem. Generally over time, banking systems tend to create more new loans at a slightly higher rate than they are repaid, and so the system is in a more or less continuous state of growth. There's no reason why it couldn't be regulated to be stable - but the problem is nobody at this time knows what that would do to the economy. The best guess at the moment is that a low but positive rate of expansion is optimal.
