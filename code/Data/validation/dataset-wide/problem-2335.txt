If it's honeydew, then soap & water should do the trick. Do not use harsh soap. An alternative method is to use a gritty, oily mixture to rub it out. I'm thinking maybe baking soda & vegetable oil. The grit helps break up the sticky substance, and the oil keeps it from re-sticking. Similar to using peanut butter to get gum out of your hair. Then use a soap & water solution to wash the oil out. Good luck, and let us know what ended up working. 

You can make your own easy enough. Just print onto a clear transparency (used primarily in overhead projectors). Tape that onto some clear plastic (can purchase at Home Depot and maybe art store). 

There are many, many state, national, & BLM parks, reserves, forests, wilderness areas, recreation areas, refuges, & conservation areas with a 3 hour drive. I don't know which ones allow wild camping, but seeing how many of them allow backpacking, I would guess quite a few. You may need a permit first. I wish I could tell you exactly which ones may work. If you find some, please post it back here. Another option, if you a have a large number of people in your group, is called group camping. This is usually an area close to, but separate from, the traditional camping spots. Spots like these are made to handle a large number of people, maybe 15-30, depending on the site. They will have a fire ring, but no set tent spots. You set your tent wherever you want. Often have permanent pit toilets. No showers. And far enough from other that playing music and/or loud talking won't disturb others. Whatever you do, PLEASE, PLEASE, be careful with campfires. Everything is so dry right now because of the worst drought since '77, that even a hard look may start a fire. 

The warning during hunting season is not so much a legal restriction, but a safety one. Many regions allow night time hunting in season, and the risk to you is that you may be mistaken for a target animal and shot! Most tourist trails and blaze paths should be appropriately signposted, giving warnings if they go through a hunt area, so the hiker should be well aware of risky locations. I would be more concerned with general, unprepared or un-maintained paths, as these may not have specific warnings posted. Legal requirements will vary considerably - in Scotland, for example, there is no trespass offence, but there are restrictions around military installations, and while these don't appear to have differing requirements between night and day I would imagine guards may be even more suspicious of someone close by at night. You also may find it harder to spot warning or 'Keep Out' signs. 

The second option would be my preferred one - I have a range of sleeping bags based on expected conditions, and any of them (except for the coldest rated) will work over a reasonably wide range. 

Most of the mushrooms you will find in a guide are low risk because they don't have similarities to poisonous ones - if you have a good guide it should point out the ones where identification is more difficult. Avoid those ones and you will be much safer! 

remember, a jump from 80 feet is pretty easy to stop - you don't need much depth of water to be safe. If I had 20 feet of water under me I'd be confident I could stop before hitting the bottom, especially with baggy clothing. 

The answer is in your bowing action - the travel comes from your arm movement not being in a straight line each direction: there is a bias one way or the other. Usually the bias is in the direction that relieves the string overlap, in your case this is up the way, so you need to actively bias the other way slightly. I find it is easier to bias against an up-tending bow than a down-tending. The way I learned to do it without much travel was by using the same process as playing snooker or pool: learning to move my hand in a straight line along the length of the bow/cue by involving my entire arm correctly. On the push stroke try to push downwards with the heel of your palm - almost grinding the bow downwards - and on the return stroke just keep the bow level. 

Forget the DEET. That's for mosquitoes, and it's not a repellent, but rather it interferes with their sense of smell so since they can't smell you (food) they don't bother you. It's also toxic. Citronella is not a repellent of any kind. Smoke from Citronella candles is a repellent (downwind from the candle). Smoke from ANY candle is the same repellent. There have been many, many studies on this, but the legends live on. What I use is Permethrin. This is an insecticide (meaning it's designed to kill) but works good as a repellent as well. It's a synthetic copy of a natural compound, â€ŽPyrethrin, found in marigold flowers. It's mostly used to spray orchards. It's also used a lot in dog flea control medicines. The stuff binds to materials, so keeps working even when dry. When sprayed onto clothing, it will continue to work for months, even after washing. The military even washes their uniforms with it. Once dry, it is odorless, colorless, and doesn't effect the feel. Basically, you won't know it's there. It will leave a residue on glass though. Safe for clothing & gear. I spray all my outdoor clothing and gear every spring, then need to reapply it in the fall. You can find it in cans at REI and other outdoor stores. I buy the concentrated stuff off of Amazon, then dilute it and apply it with a garden sprayer. I've been using this for years and am very rarely bothered by bugs. Btw, if you spray the perimeter of your house, it's pretty good at keeping bugs out. WARNING: While it's still liquid, this is very toxic to cats and fish. Once dry, it's safe. 

I haven't tried @Vorac answer, but it sounds interesting. I'm not going to say if popping a blister is correct or not. But, if you do, this is how I was taught to pop a blister: Get a needle (sterile of course) About 1/3 of an inch from the blister, insert the needle under the skin towards the blister. When it reaches the blister, remove the needle. There is now a small path that will allow the blister to drain. You may have to exert some pressure to squeeze the pus out, but not much. Doing it this way greatly reduces the chance for infection. Protect the now drained blister with a bandage, mole skin, or tape. 

For commercial vessels, such as ferries, most countries do have regulations which boats are assessed against, and a maximum number of passengers are defined for each boat. There are also a number of countries where this doesn't apply, or where regulations are not enforced. Update - removed the rest as I see now you are looking at regulations, not physical capacity 

For search party purposes, bigger is almost always better, both from the perspective of the lost individual - he/she may be able to see the light from a distance and make themselves more visible or move towards the light, and from the searcher trying to see their target, perhaps an unconscious individual - spotting clothing or non-natural material is much easier with a very bright light. For this reason pretty much all search teams carry high intensity floodlights. This is a portable, high intensity torch rated at 1100 lumens: 

A magnifying glass will not light it, and I don't think a flint and steel will directly - you need a flame rather than a spark - but that is easily solved through using a piece of newspaper with kindling, or taper. Just use your magnifying glass or flint to light the paper, then use that to light the lamp. Slightly messy, and you need to be careful where you put your taper, but pretty simple. 

Your final sentence is correct. The newspaper will wick water from internal fabric, but it will not pull water back through the Gore-Tex layer. It only allows water vapour to pass through. You actually need quite a head of pressure to force water through Gore-Tex, otherwise it would leak when you walk through a river, for example. The hiking boots my family has are all Gore-Tex, and we use newspaper after any wet hikes, and it works perfectly. 

As @wedapashi already stated, permethrin is a very good choice. And even though it's an insecticide, I find it works well as a repellent also. I treat all my clothing (even socks and underwear) and gear. I can't even remember the last time I found a tick on me. Even keeps the mosquitoes away. Once dry, it's safe for all animals (except insects). Permethrin is not new. It's a synthetic version of what's found naturally in marigolds (pyrethrin). It's currently used by the military when washing uniforms, and also sprayed on orchards and farm livestock. You can buy it in small aerosol cans ($$$), or buy it concentrated on Amazon ($) and use a garden sprayer to dilute & apply it. I would avoid using DEET if at all possible. DEET is toxic even to us. If you do use DEET, don't use anything greater than 20-30%. Higher concentrations DO NOT provide more protection, but may melt any plastics you have on you, and/or remove any paint (latex) that may be hit when spraying. 

As for different animals, or yourself, marking their territory, I think the only time that makes a difference is when the two animals are in competition with each other. A bear or mountain lion will have a large territory marked that they hunt within. However, a raccoon may occupy a smaller territory within a bears territory. The bear will ignore any raccoon markings since they don't compete for the same food. And a field mouse may have his own territory marked within the raccoon's. 

Just saying what time you're expected back isn't enough. If I'm going in an area that has any level of danger, I tell people when I expect to make contact, and when to call 911. 

You asked about equipment & training. What you didn't ask, but may be useful is where to hike and who to hike with. There are hiking & outdoor clubs all over the place. Most of them will accept beginners. Start on easier hikes and work your way up. You'll also get a chance to ask others on their equipment choices. To find these clubs, just do a google search for outdoor club and your city, or try meetup.com Have fun! 

But additionally, especially if it is in with metal objects, you must make sure it does not get shorted out when switched on. If you accidentally allow a screwdriver or ice-axe or anything metal to short the terminals, you could suddenly discover a very effective fire starter in your kit bag! 

Try running on sand for your morning or evening run - sand is very good at early stages of toughening up your feet as it still spreads the load well. Once you have toughened the skin a bit, you will be able to walk on forest trails, stone, gravel etc. But for now, the best thing you can do is moisturise your feet - this helps the cracks smooth out so they don't dig into your foot (which is what causes a lot of the pain). Moisturise, and use a pumice stone to rub down any really hard bits of skin. Your feet will toughen rapidly if you walk barefoot every day. 

However, as you have indicated, it may not be the ideal course upwind - for example if the sea is choppy a close hauled course may mean every wave halts the boat. Your close reach may be better so you can flow over the waves. You will be a couple of points lower off the wind, so will need to tack more, but if your speed across the water makes up for this then that may be the way to go. This varies a lot with the type of boat. Monohulls point much higher than catamarans, but catamarans are still faster over most courses simply because of the much high speed across water. Square riggers cannot point very high at all - in fact they are so bad at it, they used to choose routes specifically to avoid it. 

This is an answer I read somewhere else, but haven't tried it myself yet. Take this answer for what it's worth. It was stated that cat litter crystalsâ€Ž do a good job of absorbing moisture. They are also available unscented. Obviously too heavy for backpacking, but should work fine for car camping. 

All 4 major carriers have either implemented or are implementing text-to-911 service. U.S. mobile providers commit to emergency texting service In the event that this doesn't work, you can always text a friend or family member. They can then call 911 for you. If they are in a different area, then they will be transferred to the correct area. 

Most small tents these days are pretty easy to set up, but you will have to do a little more than just "throw it at the ground". :-) In the US, we have a retail chain called Walmart that sells pretty cheap stuff. This is where I would go. I don't think they're in the UK. Maybe you have something similar. Some things to look for: 

The answer has already been picked, but I want to throw in my 2 cents as well. While I'm not against plastic, the sample you show turns me off. Looks too urban. If they make one that looks more natural, then I'm all for it. Also, I think signage should be minimal. Trailheads and big intersections. Along the trail I like painted blazes. When it comes to choosing a color for the blazing, check to see if there's any local laws/customs. For instance, the Appalachian Trail is blazed white the whole way, and approach trails being blue. In NJ, trails in state parks are orange. Each trail should be colored as to not have any confusion with any other trail. An example of doing it the wrong way, a bureaucrat in GA mandated that the blazes on all 7, criss-crossing trails, in one wilderness area, were to be changed to lime green (because it's more natural). The number of lost hikers went up after that move.
