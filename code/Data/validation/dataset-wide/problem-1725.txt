Might seem like a basic question, but is ASP.NET installed? Do basic ASP.NET pages work, what you are describing doesn't seem like an IIS issue as much as configuration. 

by default in IIS 7.5, the applicationpoolidentity (aka i_AppPoolName) is used. I would NOT grant write perms and only grant on the folder(s) needed to support your app. Network service was the default account in IIS 6 and wasn't the best account. MS made a change in 7.x. 'note the default app pool name should be changed to whatever you have. ICACLS C:\inetpub\wwwroot /grant "IIS AppPool\DefaultAppPool":(M) You can do this from the GUI in r2/iis 7.5 The other option is to grant the IIS_IUSRS group modify, the app pool command line above is the most secure. I just wouldn't grant modify on all folders. Personally, I use the IIS_IUSRS perms architecture as my servers are not shared hosting servers. 

when you build a module you need to have an file in the manifests directory. Rename to look like this: 

As an updated answer, on Ubuntu 16.04.1 I was able to do the following to resize a volume from 1024GB to 1.4TB: 

Start by disabling the default site (). If you're not serving content there, then remove it. The order in which sites are loaded matters (that's why default is prefixed with 000). The default site will be the first .conf loaded (based on alphabetical ordering). If you have set in your default.conf, then it will respond regardless of the vHosts that come after it. Once you disable the default site, bounce apache, and comment below if it doesn't work. we'll try something else. 

Oh, and be sure in Redmine's Administration page you point it at the proper url, otherwise it won't generate links correctly... 

If you know the sub domains, then I'd have a different site (call it site 2) pointing to app1, put the certain domains as host-headers with the same ip address as the other unknown on a separate site that has ip address bindings (call it site 1). When you want to update code for site 2, update the folder location to app2 on site2 with the host-headers. If you have multiple servers, I would take one out of load, update to your needs, put in load and continue with other boxes. Hope that helps. 

logparser has the ability to insert into syslog type logparser -h -o:syslog Wrap into a batch file or powershell script. That is one option. Examples: Send error entries in the IIS log to a SYSLOG server: 

Are these local accounts or domain accounts? If these are local accounts, they can't be moved. Are these IIS or windows users? You can review the applicationHost.config (make a backup copy first) and see what configuration is stored in there. I asked a question about moving IIS manager users to another machine, a MS team member mentioned this. We need a bit more information. As far as moving the configuration over. You could try copying the sites configuration specific to the FTP site by copying and pasting the particular configuration. This involves the XML so it's not very straight forward, but is an option. $URL$ 

Well this is a loaded one...Breaking it down Number of Members You're not going to get that, most likely, given the way the VC is depicted over SNMP. There is no current "member count" value in the OID tree. your best bet would be to walk and count the Serial numbers returned (or use the memberID, or MACs, or whatever). It looks like you're using Icinga, so you're probably going to want to use a script to grab that OID and count the results, since Icinga won't do that for you. I do similar things for dozens of other situations in Nagios. (I beat out a quick script based on some of those situations; use it, or use it as an example to do what you want: $URL$ Status of Members I see of no (easy) way to get present/not present statuses. That one you might just have to punt on, or monitor the VCP interfaces themselves one by one. Role Changes This would be a good one to use traps for; but if you're set on using polling and you are statically setting priorities so that you know what your master/backup will be most of the time, then you can look at the values under ; node .0 will be member 0, node .1 will be member 1, and so on. A value of 1 is Master, 2 is Backup, and 3 is Linecard (that's available in the MIB itself). The problem is that if you leave all that up to the dynamics of a default virtual chassis set up, without setting mastership priorities static member IDs (based on serial numbers), etc, those values could change. 

I have a SharePoint 2007 farm (SP2, June Cumulative Update) where the User Profile Import job is now failing. The last log entry on the User Profile and Properties page shows the error message "The parameter is incorrect". This persists whether the job is run manually or via the defined schedule. What is interesting is that I see it working and running good in that I can see it successfully enumerating the AD profiles and the count goes up to the number I expect. But...it appears that this data is not persisted as I have old accounts still showing up in "Active Profiles" but are no longer on Active Directory. Also I can go to a test server and use the same settings for the import connection and user filter and it runs successfully. Any ideas on what the problem might be or how to troubleshoot? I have looked at all the logs but nothing has stood out so far and Google searches haven't turned up much on this topic. Ryan 

You are confusing SFTP with FTPS. SFTP is Secure FTP; FTP Encrypted over an SSH session. FTPS is SSL-secured FTP. In other words, FTPS is to FTP what HTTPS is to HTTP. You cannot use vsFTPd to serve SFTP traffic, but you can use it to serve FTPS traffic. It sounds like you want to keep things simple, so SFTP is most likely the way you want to go. You'll need WinSCP (Windows), Transmit (Mac), or some other SFTP-capable client to connect to it, or use any of a plethora of command line tools. As F Hauri has pointed out, an SFTP server is easily installed by installing SSH on most modern distros, using whatever package management tool they utilize, and permissions are managed at the machine level, usually with an group. 

You can use a and daisy chain the to require the config change(s). If the Exec fails (exit status != 0) the subsequent tasks that require it should fail as well. I do something similar to execute ssh-keygen then set special permissions on .ssh when creating new users. Example: 

By default all website folders should only need 'read' unless you adjusted the perms. I'd use NTFS permissions to lockdown to certain folders. I wouldn't recommend having individual files in different locations. I'd lockdown by folder. 

This can't be controlled as far as I know. First time i've seen this type of question. There is a range of ports Windows uses for dynamic allocation, which is the range you are seeing. You can control dynamic ports but it requires having control of both the client and server to limit the number of dynamic ports. For an internet facing site, this is not fesible. 

Try a hosts file entry remotely on a client and see if you things work. Once that is all set, you'll just need the dns A record as mentioned in the previous post. This is something I do all the time to make sure the setup is working both locally as well as remotely. 

"Getting the right part number" generally would involve talking to somebody at Dell, or a reseller. You can also troll through the technical information that Dell provides on their website, but honestly when faced with similar snipe hunts in the past, I would have had better luck trolling eBay for keywords; in this case "Dell R710 Backplane". A cursory glance tells me "W814D" is the part#. But I am not endorsing that, YMMV, please do your own research. All of that being said: Generally Dell doesn't ship machines like that. If it has 6 bays open on the front, it will have a 6-bay SAS backplane installed. Depending on how things were originally ordered, they might not have cabled the second upstream port on the backplane; but I would find that suspicious too. I would make sure all the SFF cables are in place, and what they are being cabled to (could one be going to a PERC and another to an onboard port or something equally weird/dumb?)
