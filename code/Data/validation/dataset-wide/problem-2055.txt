As explained in "Clean Code" Comments tend to rot over time, therefore having such comments is unacceptable. Also, comments are also seen as a noise: too many comments, and you must be doing something wrong. If you need to explain an algorithm, some special implementation, design, or anything else - write a document. Explain why is something is implemented that way, and what are alternatives. 

Since other answers tell that it is acceptable, I can only assume they never worked in an open office. Or noise do not disturb them. I worked and I know how bad it can be. And no headphone is going to help you. That being said, I would throw you and your duck out of the window as soon as you start talking to it in open space. It is absolutely unacceptable to add additional disruption and noise to an environment that is already bad enough. If you have to talk to your duck, go close yourself in a meeting room (or whatever you got there), and discuss without disturbing your colleagues further. 

If the company wanted to fire you, it would. No matter what you said, no matter how much you cried. That said, leave whenever you want. Specially if management doesn't give a crap about what you think, as this seems to be the case. This is bussiness. 

It's business. You're leaving because you found something better. It they found someone better than you, they would fire you on the spot. 

You should make it clear to your employer during interview that you haven't had contact or don't know X product or technology. Then it's up to the employer to hire you and wait a little time for you to get up to speed, or just don't hire you. If they happen to hire you and you didn't warn them about this during the interview, it might be very bad to you, because you ommited very important information. Anyway, you have experience with Unix, it won't be very hard for you to gain some knowledge in Windows. Most things are easier to do on it than on Unix. Unless you are apllying for a SysAdmin role, then I suggest you study a lot before hand instead of trying to learn on the go. 

At every job I was, I had a weekly or monthly meetings with my superiors. I assume you have too. If not, ask him for a meeting to discuss how he sees your progress so far. At the meeting you can mention all things that bothers you, but with positive tone. That means : 

Yes, you and your coleague are doing it wrong. You will be able to work long hours for some time, but after you will start feeling exhaustion, being stressed out, and finaly the burnout. The quality of your work will worsen, and finaly you are going to become sick. If you work in an open office, the things are just going to be worse. Working more than 40 hours per week increases 'burnout' risk (read the comments how people gets hearth and other diseases, starts office fight, etc). Why Working More Than 40 Hours a Week is Useless : 

What do you expect from this? What do you think would change? What random amount of time do you think would make your quitting less unprofessional? 

Just go on and tell him. You're helping him save money. Were it the other way around, then you would need an excellent document. Edit: If you need help explaining, just say something along the lines of: "Hei b0ss, I know that you're worried about my productivity and wanted to buy that new machine. But I found this 10 bucks cable that will be more useful and way cheaper than a new PC. What do you think about this?". 

Contrary to other answers, I would say "No, it is not necessary". From the job description, it should be clear that the job require certain level of a language proficiency. The person passing you the CVs should be capable enough to filter candidates on such trivial requirement. 

I work as a senior software engineer in Germany. In the last 6 years, I had at least 25 interviews. I was asked only once a puzzle question. Needless to say, whole interview was quite odd. My experience is that people do not ask puzzle questions anymore. At least not in IT sector. For example, in google “What works well are structured behavioral interviews, where you have a consistent rubric for how you assess people”. Even microsoft, where the puzzle questions were born, stopped asking such questions since they realized it is a waste of time. There is this famous article "What would Feynman do?", which discredit such questions in quite a funny way. 

I see three options: 1 - Ask the company to buy one, so everybody can use it 2 - Raise funds with your colleages to buy one (we did this with the coffee machine here) 3 - Bring your own, but be prepared to see people use or eventually break it. Anyway, ask your boss or HR first to see if it is allowed to bring your own stuff to the office. 

Depends on your industry. But, since your boss said they dress casual, I'd say that wearing a suit will do no harm nor good. I, as a software developer, have never cared about over/under dressing. I've worked in start-ups, small companies(50~150 people) and big companies (2000+) and in none of them someone said anything about the way I dress. In all of them it was casual. I always go to work with jeans trousers and a T-shirt. But in all interviews I keep the jeans trousers and change the tee for a polo. I noticed that anytime someone overdresses, people make light jokes about that. But, if you work for a bank, for example, you might have to wear a suit and tie. 

As you said, you did everything you could. So, just relax and let the people in higher management perform their plans. That includes stopping to secretly work on this project. Let the people doing the communication with the client inform them that there are higher priority tasks, or whatever they want to say. As for your carrier and reputation - I see nothing wrong. If you are performing your tasks, your reputation will not be damaged. 

I know that such dressing is a big no-no for a job, and less for an interview, in conservative areas (and Germany is very conservative, considering there are people to advise how to dress up, and prepare people for an interview). But would it be ok to show up badly dressed (for example in flip-flops) to test if they said it is ok? 

If your boss is a person worth not cutting ties with, a simple "Thanks for all the help and opportunities, but I'm off to new adventures" is enough. 

Your boss already knows that most likely you won't stay for five years. Also, consider that if YOU said that you had to stay in this position for five years and your boss promoted you anyway, he wouldn't think twice if he had to fire you halfway through this period. So, take the position. If asked about, say the truth. If he hires you anyway, it's up to him to prepare for your departure. If he doesn't hire you, at least you tried. 

When it comes to it, only your manager can approve it. Therefore, the only answer is to talk to your manager. But I see one good benefit : your solution to your problem may not be the best, and when you write it, someone will read it and write you comments (code or idea review). Of course, I assume you are not over doing it. SE shouldn't interfere with your every day duties and your work. 

I live in Germany, and I have seen several resumes where people wrote that they hold German citizenship (or are entitled to work in Germany). As you, they have foreign names. People put this under personal data. See this example. Although it may be a bit weird in US, I have also seen people putting place of birth. 

As you stated in your comment answering mine, he makes offensive comments face-to-face during work. First, do as keshlam says. Unfriend him. He is a toxic person, avoid contact as much as possible. After that, go talk to your manager. It surely will have no positive effect talking to the offender, so you have to talk to your superior. Explain what is happening and ask him to deal with it. In many places around the world such offences are against the law and might get the offender and the company in trouble. Wait a few days. If it doesn't stop, ask the manager if he talked to the offender. Depending on the response, go to HR.
