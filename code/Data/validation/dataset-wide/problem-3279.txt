The Wikipedia entry is as condensed as it gets. If this project needs a tiny bit more of fleshing out some intricate interactions between German war aims, policies and the Ukrainian as well as Russian side you should at least consult: Fritz Fischer: "Germany's Aims in the First World War", WW Norton: New York, 1967. The most relevant chapters being "13. Germany and the new Russia: The promotion of revolution and attempts to make a separate peace" (especially the part on "The Genesis of the 'Autonomy' Policy" p 375), "17. The objectives of war aims policy, II: Between annexation and self-determination", "20. The elaboration of the Ostraum: The Ukraine, the Crimea, the Don Transcaucasia" This will get you a feel for the ambitious aims and also attitudes of many officers of the Imperial German Army (the "Reichswehr" was never officially in Ukraine, existing as an organisation with this name only from 1919â€“1935). Orest Subtelny: "Ukraine: A History", University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 42009. This will get you a first impression on the internal dynamics of rada/soviet, left wing and nationalist factions, as well as a first glimpse into who founded what and who funded whom. Money, coalitions and other support going in sometimes unexpected directions. Although I find the memoirs or diaries of characters like Ludendorff, Hoffmann etc. much more revealing for this type of quest, the war diary of Gottfried Rinker who was in Odessa is partly online. 

The critical factor all these answers leave out: The Black Death. The Plague of Justinian swept through the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires a few generations before Islam. On the Byzantine side, the reduction in manpower available for warfare was near 90%. The damage to the economies of both empires made it unlikely they'd rebuild the population losses quickly enough, and, as @user64617 pointed out, the two were frequently at war with each other anyway. As to where I get the "90% reduction" figure: Before the Plague, Justinian had sent Belisarius to conquer Italy. Belisarius frequently requested more troops, as cities came over to the Empire's side and he needed to garrison them. He'd request 10,000 -- and get 1,000. After the Plague, Belisarius was again sent to Italy, to fix some problems other generals had created and, if possible, continue the conquest. Again, he'd request 10,000 additional troops -- but this time, all he'd get would be 100. The political events between the two phases did not involve Justinian -- he was sick with the plague -- and his personal attitude towards Belisarius, and his intent to rebuild the Empire, had not changed. (This doesn't mean 90% of the population died; it means enough people died that 90% of those who would have been available for the armies instead were needed for farming, shipping, trades, etc.) Sources: Belisarius, the Last Roman General by Ian Hughes; Justinian's Flea by William Rosen. 

This is not actually an answer to the question as stated, but rather a commentary on "them criticizing the founders' attitudes regarding the American Indians" (which does seem to be the actual crux of your question, however). It should be noted that Thomas Jefferson (also, obviously, the principal author of the declaration of independence and therefore the statement in question) had the following to say in his first State-of-the-Union address: 

This is a good question. I don't have any hard sources, unfortunately; but I can speculate a bit. If we speak of the extremes to which care and protection of cultural artifacts have been taken today, I would think that the most important reason is reactions against the somewhat careless archaeology of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Seeing how much was lost in the hasty and sometimes amateurish work probably prompted measures to curb careless excavations, which may well have led to further compounding of a general sentiment for a "prerogative", so to speak, of properly scientific archaeologists. I admit this explanation alone is somewhat incomplete without an answer for why archaeology "boomed" so fast in the 19th century, though. I can only guess this was because the rising living standards of the middle class allowed more people to travel abroad and visit ancient ruins. Another contributing reason could be that the growing colonial empires of the West allowed western subjects to travel further and longer while still under greater security and a reasonable protection of law. If we speak of the modern prices more specifically, this is easier to answer. Since many (all?) nations have adopted laws for the strict preservation of archaeological artifacts, the supply of such artifacts available for purchase has been very greatly diminished, obviously driving up prices a lot. It can probably also be said that the active practice of archaeology as a discipline has only started to be possible due to the general increase in wealth since the middle ages onwards. Archaeology is a rather specific science which is hard to practice without the specialization allowed for by a more advanced division of labor, which can only come from greater capital accumulation. This is all speculation, of course. If I were to try and find sources, I would look for preparatory investigations and/or parliamentary debate for the first laws which regulate trade in antiquities. I don't know where to find such, but it would probably reveal why such laws were enacted, and shed some light over the sentiment of the day. 

For some years (a couple centuries?) the official language of Byzantium was Latin; it slowly transitioned to Greek and for a time both were in use. The Turkish Archaeological Museum has a sarcophagus with the inscription in both Greek and Latin. Some of the offices of the empire had Latin titles, and the most popular public attraction was the Hippodrome -- chariot races. They continued Roman construction practices and public works -- the city's water was provided by aqueducts coming in from surrounding hills -- and customs like public baths. The court system was the same, as well, allowing for a handful of minor reforms and additions, up until Justinian's complete reform. The sarcophagus, photo taken by me: $URL$ 

Keep in mind that "heavy military ships" were rare -- most galleys were triremes or smaller designs -- biremes, penteconters, liburna. Their construction was well within the capabilities of small ports, and manning them took 50 or so crew -- also within the capabilities of small ports and pirate bands. They only had to be faster than merchant ships, and just about any lightly-loaded galley with a fresh crew could manage that. And the differences between civilian and military ships were narrow, at times. The Greek penteconter was BOTH. 

Yes, they had dedicated engineers for siege engines and works. Simple fortifications were handled by the legionnaires, but more complicated efforts had specialists. No, not every army had them. A specific example is Julian's army intended to attack Ctesiphon. In interest in speed, and because he did not believe Ctesiphon had walls, Julian did not take any engineers. Between the lack of any way to break the walls, and with the bulk of the Persian army marching their way, Julian was forced to abandon his attempt to sack Ctesiphon and attempt to get his army back to Roman territory.
