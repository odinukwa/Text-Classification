Creation of the codex In the 9th century, Benedict began encouraging his monks to read and write and collect the religious knowledge so that it would not be otherwise lost. Through the 11th century, monks, sitting in the cloisters, studied the scriptures and copied them for other libraries. Scribing was not all a monk had to do all day. There were several prayer sessions, gardens had to be tended, food prepared, and the vellum and quills made. A single scribe, it is estimated, could write as two or three books a year. As time went on, the scribes improved their processes, until by the end of the manuscript era in the 15th century, a book could be written and illuminated in as little as a few days. One of the fastest known writers in the 15th century boasted he could produce the old testament in three days. Most books written during these years (the 9th to the 15th cent.) were at the very least decorated, with the more important ones being illuminated with gold leaf and pigments. Gospel books (new testament), the tanukah (old testament) and psalms were almost always illuminated. From the 9th through the 15th centuries, or the manuscript era, the materials remained basically the same as listed above. If a single scribe were to make his own vellum and quills, many months would be required just for those tasks. Of course, in practice, the parchmenter made the sheets, another would make writing utensils, another the inks, etc. In the earlier years, of the era, where monks alone were the scribes, as I said, it would take the better part of a year to make one or two copies of one book, since a monks day was never just writing. As the years passed, and secular persons were used, who could concentrate on only writing, the time required was shortened. As Mr. Durden pointed out, there was no such thing as the Bible as we know it, not even through to the end of the manuscript era. The testaments were (usually) separate, as was the apocalypse, the psalms, etc. It wasn't until the print era (typesetting) that everything was combined into one work. If you were a landed noble (i.e. wealthy) you might contract a codex of the gospels and get it in a year's time. (but probably not, as you most likely couldn't read anyway.) 

M. King Hubbert predicted that Soviet oil production would decline as it did, thus implying an economic collapse. 

$URL$ Aqueducts did, in some cases, freeze over. Aqueducts were built underground in the northern provinces to even out the temperatures over the day, and this helped a bit. $URL$ $URL$ Flow rates are 5 to 70 L/s on modern models of Roman dropshafts. However, you can't prevent water from freezing over long distances just by increasing the flow rate. Presumably there was no running water if it became too cold. 

As you can see, there is population movement from south to north during warm periods and vice versa, with peaking of southern empires during warmings. The peak of the Roman and Mayan empires coincided with a warming, and they then fell as the world cooled and northern populations invaded. A similar pattern occurs with the Vikings, Arabs, colonialism, and pretty much any empire you can think of. The current migration pattern from south to north, and associated population change, is in accordance with historical climate relationships. The other parts of the question are vague and meaningless, and can't be answered. 

$URL$ About 20k children were born, 1k of them black. The white children usually went back to America and grew up with their biological parents. The mixed children generally stayed in the UK due to miscegenation laws in many US states. Took about 5 seconds to google this 

Much as the entertainment wrestlers of today, wounds and injuries were common. Just because the gladiator you face today is a colleague, perhaps even friend, doesn't mean that gladius he (or she) is swinging won't slice open your skin if you stumble the wrong way. So the gladiators were provided the best of medical care, at least as was known then. Plus, while pure slaves might have to live on scraps and be lucky to count one good meal a day, the physical exertions of gladiators meant they had to be fed not only with more regularity, but better quality as well. 

From usmilitariaforum.com Others believed that an enemy soldier could sneak up behind, in hand-to-hand combat, and use the leverage of the helmets front lip with the strap and break the neck using the back edge. Having worn a 'steel pot' in my earliest army time, I will say the number one thing about it, by far is it is heavier than any other hat I ever wore on my head. When running, whether or not the chin strap was properly fastened, that pot would rock forward and back and side to side, taking my head with it, such that I was forced to use a hand to keep it in place regardless of the strap! Now, considering that the original strap was just a strip of some material that was itchy and scratchy, I can easily understand why soldiers wouldn't want it done up. Even the later straps, like I used, made of nylon and cotton webbing, would be quite the sweat magnet and end up very rough. Finally, one of the biggest reasons, directly related to the weight (did I say it is VERY heavy?) was that a soldier would want to remove it whenever and wherever possible, as soon as possible. Figuring that soldiers, even those in the front lines, spend most of their time not actually fighting, but standing, sitting, waiting, marching, being trucked here and there, would tire of constantly doing and undoing the pain in the ass d-ring connections. 

Remember that all societies have institutionalization. People today who are considered mentally retarded, criminal, and so forth are placed in an institution. Indeed they are sometimes given work as in slavery. Furthermore, liberal societies could be considered to be wage slave societies as well. You can read more here about how Marx considered slave labor to be no worse than any other type of labor. 

Mussolini was basically someone Hitler bribed to stay on his side. Italy was probably a net burden to the Axis; its main contribution as an ally was as a buffer. Mussolini himself has been survived as grandiose and egocentric, and his rule eventually destroyed Italy. There's your paragraph. Germany sent at least a quarter of its oil production to Italy just to keep Mussolini afloat. Germany also sent some token forces to Africa to delay the British from taking over the African colonies, even though British blockades made this difficult. Eventually Mussolini was overthrown and the new government switched sides. After this point he had little impact on the war and was eventually captured and shot by partisans. The aftermath of his rule was that Italy was totally wrecked and defeated. The only brilliant part is before the war, when he achieved power with his political goalpost shifting and charisma.

The Germans were enormously outnumbered. They were fighting an opponent with over ten times more oil production. At the time, the US was the largest oil producer in the world. Furthermore, the Allies were the ones focusing on strategic bombing. Germany didn't invest as much resources in air defense because it had a land war in the East going on which was much more threatening. 

They weren't trained how to just stand there and look good, but were given training in multiple weapons and armor. While each was allowed to fight in the armor of choice, if today's exhibition required one 'side' of the match to use daggers and tridents, with the other using swords and spears, then that's what they used. If you had never even picked up a spear before, you'd fail miserably in the entertainment, be booed, and perhaps get the 'thumbs down'. 

I am of the opinion that your assertion is flawed.

That was it. At all times, out of the harbor, they operated in war time conditions, which meant submersed most/all of the daylight hours, and at night, 5 men above decks. 

It's a hard request to fulfill. The interesting economic stuff happened later, so there aren't too many books covering what you're looking for. Arnold Toynbee is your best bet. $URL$ After that, I recommend Eric Hobsbawm. 

"Country" is derived from the Latin term for "land across the river". Thus, in history, nobody really talks of "countries" if they can avoid it. But we can talk about "states". $URL$ The claim that Andorra became independent in 805 could easily be a myth created to justify sovereignty. The Andorran government claims to have the charter of independence locked in a safe. We have no way of knowing what happened. If the earlier date is wrong, we know it became independent in 1278. 

The same methodology could be applied to predict the collapse of the Shah's government, the 1970s stagflation in the US, and the fate of oil producers in general. Hubbert published his method in 1956. 

Ivan the Terrible did restrict the movement of peasants, and entrench the institution of slavery. But at the same time, he persecuted the nobles and apparently was seen as protecting peasants from exploitation. Thus, just based on the limited information we have, passed down through folktales, Ivan was seen as an ally of the peasants. Being terrible to boyars might be a compliment. Source

While there are many articles discussing the Australian Aborigines' de facto legalized slavery, or essentially free labor, the fact seems to be that they were never de jure slaves, as Africans were. Why didn't England press the Australian indigenous Aborigine population into actual slavery? 

Well, drugs and drug abuse has been around since the beginning of man, of that I am positive. In the Victorian era, for instance, addiction to laudanum was a major thing. Mary Todd Lincoln (the First Lady) was said to have been so addicted. As far as the American 50's, according to a blog I read the wide-spread drug abuse of the 60's was the direct result of the behind-the-scenes drug use of the 50's. The Beat Generation (aka Beatnicks) were the abusers of the 50s. WWII caused a boom in the development of pain killers. The drugs of choice of the 50s appear to have been Marijuana, Heroin and LSD. Their main usage demographics, however, were mostly inner-city and the so-called Jazz-scene. The blog is pretty enlightening and finished with several citations. Well worth a read. My Google search terms used here was "drug use in the 50s" 

Baldwin IV was crowned King of Jerusalem, from 1174 until his death in 1186 at the ripe old age of 24. As a child, his tutor, William of Tyre, discovered he had leprosy. Understanding that he was the heir of Almaric, still, in order to be crowned, the Haute Cour would have had to agree. Why would they have? Wasn't a leper shunned by all? I apologize for all of the Wikipedia links, but well, they're easy.
