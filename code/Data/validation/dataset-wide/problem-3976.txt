I'm not sure what it is that you read in Hartshorne that suggested that $(f_*\mathcal O_{\mathrm{Spec} B})_{\mathfrak p}$ is equal to $(\mathcal O_{\mathrm{Spec} B})_{\mathfrak q}$, since this is not true. My suggestion is that you consider two illustrative cases: 

As Joel points out, this is not possible. Even in the case of a discrete series rep'n, one can't control the value of the central character on the non-compact part of $F_v^*$. What one can do (in some generality; for precise references recent work of Sug Woo Shin might be relevant) is show that the set of tempered representations which are local components of automorphic forms are "large" in the space of all tempered rep'ns, where "large" can be taken to mean something like "equidistributed according to Plancherel measure", or also "Zariski dense in the Spec of the Bernstein centre". (There may well be caveats to both these statements, though, so I would look at Shin's work and whatever references are contained therein.) 

This semi-simplicity is a part of what is called the Tate conjecture. It is generally believed to be true, but little is known about it outside the case of $H^1$, in either the finite field or global field case. Searching on mathscinet for "Tate conjecture" (or googling) should turn up the relevant literature. 

As James Borger writes in his comments above, the answer is surely no. The restrictions on the characters appearing in the Galois representation attached to $G$ are being forced by the fact that $G$ has a finite flat model. If you throw that assumption away, you lose any control on the ramification of the Galois action on $G(\overline{K})$, and it can be whatever you like. (The point is that any representation of $Gal(\overline{K}/K)$ on a $p$-power order abelian group, or on an $F$-vector space for some char. $p$ finite field $F$, is the group of $\overline{K}$-bar points of a finite group scheme, or $F$-vector space scheme, over $K$. But if the ramification conditions in the conclusion of Raynaud's theorem aren't met, then this group scheme won't have a finite flat prolongation over $R$.) If you want to have a theory generalizing Raynaud's theory of finite flat group schemes which applies to other representations of $Gal(\overline{K}/K)$ (i.e. ones that don't come from finite flat group schemes over $R$) then you will need to learn integral $p$-adic Hodge theory, which is a highly developed theory. The first step is to learn something about Fontaine--Lafaille theory (which deals with the case when $e = 1$). The step after this is to learn about Breuil modules and/or Kisin modules. But all of this is rather technical and involved, and a serious investement to learn. So you might be better off explaining your motivation and goals, so that people can give more specific and appropriate advice. 

If you fix a prime $\ell$, and consider the Galois action of the decomposition group $D_p$ on the (rational) $\ell$-adic Tate module (here "rational" means tensored with $\mathbb Q_{\ell}$), then (in a standard way, due to Deligne) you can convert this action into a representation of the Weil--Deligne group, and so in particular of the Weil group. Restricting to the inertia group, you get a representation of the inertia group $I_p$, known as the inertial type $\tau$. It is independent of $\ell$. (The only reason to detour through the Weil--Deligne group is to deal with possibly infinite image of tame inertia; if the elliptic curve has potentially good reduction, then we can skip this step and just take the representation of $I_p$ on the $\ell$-adic Tate module, which has finite image and is independent of $\ell$.) [Added: In the above, one should insist that $\ell \neq p$. If $\ell = p$, then one can also arrive at a Weil-Deligne representation, and hence inertial type, which is the same as the one obtained as above for $\ell \neq p$, but to do this one must use Fontaine's theory: one forms the $D_{pst}$ of the rational $p$-adic Tate module, which then can be converted into a Weil--Deligne representation in a standard way, and hence gives an inertial type.] Now one can look at the deformation ring $R_{\rho}^{[0,1],\tau}$ parameterizing lifts of $\rho$ of which at $p$ are of inertial type $\tau$ and Hodge--Tate weights $0$ and $1$. (See Kisin's recent JAMS paper about potentially semi-stable deformation rings.) [Added: Here $\ell = p$, i.e. we are looking at $p$-adic deformations of $\rho$ which are potentially semi-stable at $p$, and whose inertial type, computed via $D_{pst}$ as in the above added remark, is equal to $\tau$. But note that, by the preceding discussion, these deformations do precisely capture the idea of lifts of $\rho$ having the same "reduction type" as the original elliptic curve $E$.] Let's suppose that $E$ really does have potentially good reduction. Then Kisin's "moduli of finite flat group schemes" paper shows that any lift parameterized by $R^{[0,1],\tau}$ is modular. This shows that $R^{[0,1],\tau} = {\mathbb T},$ for an appropriately chosen ${\mathbb T}$. One thing to note: unlike in the original Taylor--Wiles setting, from this statement one doesn't get quantitive information about adjoint Selmer groups, and one doesn't get any simple interpretation of what this $R = {\mathbb T}$ theorem means on the integral level. (In other words, Artinian-valued points of $R^{[0,1],\tau}$ have no simple interpretation in terms of a ramification condition at $p$; this is related to the fact that the theory of $D_{pst}$ only applies rationally, i.e. to ${\mathbb Q}_p$-representations, not integrally, i.e. not to representations over $\mathbb Z_p$ or over Artin rings.) 

The lattices corresponding to elliptic curves are not the same as the lattices appearing in Lie theory. In the theory of modular forms, it is the weight $k$ (lying in the lattice $\mathbb Z$) that is a manifestation of Lie theory. (The lattice $\mathbb Z$ is the weight lattice of $SO(2)$.) Added: Davidac897 asks "Why are you so sure"? Of course, there could be a connection that I am missing; I am just speaking from my own experience with these objects. But in the passage from classical modular forms (say as described in Serre's Course in arithmetic) to the representation-theoretic point of view, a lattice $\Lambda$ in $\mathbb C$ becomes a lattice $\mathbb \Lambda$ in $\mathbb R^2$, which becomes a point of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb Z)\backslash \mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb R)$. Thus the lattices corresponding to elliptic curves become points of a quotient $\Gamma\backslash G$ for some real Lie group $G$ and some cofinite volume discrete subgroup $\Gamma$. For more general real Lie groups, one can think of such quotients as being a kind of generalized "moduli of lattices of some rank with some structure". There may be points corresponding to lattices with special symmetry (e.g. the square or triangular lattice in the elliptic curve case), and, yes, you are correct that root systems are lattices with special symmetry. But this is not the usual way that root systems intervene in the theory of automorphic forms, which is what my answer above was intended to point out. 

This answer is related to fedja's. Many universities, at least in the U.S., hire various kinds of adjunct faculty to help with the departmental teaching load. (These positions are often called "visiting professorships", but I don't have in mind the kind of short-term research visiting collaboration that fedja discusses, but rather semester or year long positions, funded by the dept., not an individual, for the primary purpose of helping with the teaching needs of the dept. At least at my university, these are not offered by individuals; very likely the details of how they are offered differs from one dept. to another.) At my university, and I would imagine at others, the basis for the offering of these positions is quality of teaching. Obtaining such a position, and doing well at it (so that one gets subsequent strong teaching recommendations) can be a foot in the door to a teaching-based academic position. Also, at my university (and I know we are not unique in this, although perhaps uncommon) there are no math classes taught in lectures of 200; everything is taught in classes of around 30 or fewer students. So what matters is the quality of the teaching recommendation in relation to teaching such classes. Speaking more generally (and so less authoritatively), I would imagine that for teaching recommendations in general, the quality and strength of the recommendation is important (the applicant should have a record of good lecturing skills, sincere relationships with students, etc.) rather than the precise nature of the previous teaching experience. (After all, some new Ph.D.s will be hired to positions in which they might have to give 200 person lectures, but even if they have had prior teaching experience as a grad student, it is less likely that they will have given lectures to a class of 200.)
