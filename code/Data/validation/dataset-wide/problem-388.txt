The worst case scenario is effectively a nuclear winter if it results in a supervolcanic eruption. If Iceland disappears in the manner postulated by this question 2018 won't be a good year to be alive. 

If the hypothetical ten millennia geothermal power plant uses hot dry rocks as its source of heat, they are not only ubiquitous but it would guarantee a constant power supply. This technology is in its infancy, but the builders of a ten millennia geothermal energy system will have developed it because of its reliability and stability as a power source. 

Simply people will make things. Creativity and curiosity are unstoppable. They will make music, paint paintings, write fiction, poetry too, carve wood and stone. They will study their past -- history, palaeontology, and archaeology. They will study nature -- plants, animals, insects, marine creatures. There will be sports and games to play. There are stars to study. Astronomy is for everybody. They explore their planet by hiking, bush walking, mountain climbing, scuba diving, and soaring through its atmosphere. Forget about passively indulging in boredom. With their long lives and few obstacles they will throw themselves into living. They can afford to take the risks. They have the medical science to repair damaged bodies and do it all again. While they don't need further technological innovations, there will be ample scope for plain old fashioned scientific research of curiosity driven type. Basically this civilization will be living through a permanent and continuous artistic, cultural and academic renaissance. They will live like no-one has lived before. 

No explanation is needed. It's extraterrestrial technology. There's nothing in the suit and the battery that even suggests machinery. Nothing to examine or analyse. Suit and portal just work fine for dimensional travel. So does recharging the battery. The science behind it is too advanced for our primitive minds. However, what you want is a few throwaway lines from the scientists. I'd suggest they would be all arguing with each other and not getting anywhere. Examples: "I think it's M theory." "I tried that, it doesn't make sense." "What about the many worlds version of QM?" "Superficially, yes, but still nothing pans out." "I disagree. The portal is a shadow matter converter." "That discarded concept. Ridiculous! No it's a wormhole." "But it's not any sort of wormhole that general relativity predicts." "I think the portal generates a field of coherent quantum tunnelling." "That's easy for you to say. But what's the mechanism?" "Your guess is as good as mine." Basically everyone arguing at cross-purposes scientifically and getting nowhere. A whole lot of maybes but no genuine answer to dimensional travel. That should be pseudoscience enough. 

Assuming a generation ship travelling at one-tenth lightspeed changes to its night sky it take place as stars can no longer be seen and as new stars come into view. For sunlike stars this will of the order of fifty light years. So the sunlike stars visible at the commencement of its journey have disappeared after travelling a distance of fifty light years. While new sunlike stars will have come into view. This take about five hundred years. Much brighter stars which are visible over greater distances such as Rigel at 864.3 light years (lyrs), Betelguese at 642.5 lyrs, Aldebaran 65.23 lyrs, and the much closer Sirius at 8.611 lyrs. They will remain visible over greater distances and many of them will still be visible for many millennia travel time. Since it is the much brighter stars that dominate the night sky the rate of change of the apparent night sky in the generation ship will be of the order of millennia. The main changes will be stars gradually "moving" their positions relative to the motion of the generation ship and the disappearance of older stars and the appearance of new ones. This does assume the generation ship is travelling many thousands of light years. Shorter journeys will not have the same drastic changes to their night sky. This answer assumes that the personnel on the generation ship have access to the actual sky outside their generation ship. Inside the generation ship, as other answers have suggested, a simulated night sky might be more convenient and comforting. 

This depends on the nature of the wormhole. Recently Thorne-Morris wormholes have been very fashionable. They do need exotic matter to stay open because they are extremely unstable. However, there is a better alternative. A wormhole that doesn't need exotic matter to stay open. This is the Ellis wormhole. Just read down to the section on Traversable Wormholes for more details. 

Sleep elimination technologies keep popping up in science-fiction, aren't people and especially writers aware of the problems of sleep deprivation? Besides Nancy Kress has worked this concept over in her Beggars in Spain sequence of novels. There are studies that show intellectuals and knowledge workers spend more time sleeping than ordinary mortals. Sleep appears to be higher beneficial for people who a lot of brain work. Sleep, in general, seems to be universal among animal species. We may not fully understand why we sleep but it seems to be there for a good reason. It seems foolish to assume a fancy piece of technological kit is going to get rid of it. It might be far better to assume a technology that rather than eliminating sleep, enhances its beneficial properties. Perhaps this won't reduce the amount of sleep people need, but it might do a better job of integrating memories and knowledge in our brains. Thus improving general knowledge acquisition. It's time to send sleep elimination technology the way of the videophone and other gizmos everybody imagined everyone else would want, but turned out they didn't. Better sleep, better brains. You know it makes sense. 

This article outlines the imperial slave economy that arose with European colonization expansion. This site discusses slavery in America. 

The physicist Robert L Forward proposed the concept of ultradense matter as a technique for generating localized gravitational fields. Refer to his book Future Magic (1988) where this is discussed. Assuming it is possible to manufacture sufficient qualities of ultradense matter, then a chamber or room could be made where the gravity inside was higher than the gravity outside. For example, a layer of ultradense matter could be placed beneath the chamber where its gravitation would be added to the Earth's gravitation. The result would be higher gravity above the chamber's floor. It should be noted that below the ultradense layer gravity would be reduced. The layer's gravitation pulling everything below it upwards while Earth's gravitation downwards. Depending on the local strength of the ultradense layer's gravity, gravity could be reduced to zero or it might be strong enough to enable people to walk on the ceiling. It would be physically impossible to wear garments or jewellery made of ultradense matter. Even the smallest piece would weigh many tons. The stuff would be a health hazard. The ultradense layer would need to be extremely strongly supported. The slightest accident would see it sinking deep into the Earth, with a good chance of descending to the Earth's core. 

Continental Drift This is driven a combination of subduction and the presence of a hydrosphere (a fancy way of says Earth has seas and oceans on its surface). The arrangement of land masses progressively undergoes change. The longer the timescale the more massive this changes will be. 

If your hypothetical organism is engaged with chemiluminescence involving gases would do something like the following. 

This suggests that assuming methane can act as a UV absorber as a way of keeping skies clear won't work. In fact, methane absorbing UV is making Titanian skies smog filled. So we're back to water vapor and its capacity to form an ozone layer. 

One problem is radioactivity. A battlefield after gamma-ray weapons have used will be highly contaminated just like places where nuclear weapons were detonated. Many elements will absorb gamma photons into their nuclei, leaving radioactive by-products. With air absorption, the fall-out will be far and wide. The military force deploying gamma-ray weapons could be harmed to degree comparable to the forces on the receiving end. Arms Limitation Treaties will be either set up or called for to ban gamma-ray beam weapons. If that doesn't happen, you can expect a massive outcry in the aftermath if your gamma-ray guns are used near any civilian population. Think what would happen if Hiroshima or Nagasaki were nuked today in the current Age of Media, the impact would be similar. Also, soldiers themselves will become peaceniks too. They will have seen the causalties and the own wounded of both sides of combatants. Radiation sickness isn't pretty. Deployment of gamma-ray weapons will be hazardous. Few soldiers will want to be targeted by weapons of this kind. In general, no weapon is used in isolation from politics. The deadlier the weapon, the more heated the politics. Remember of the history of the politics of nuclear weapons and the Ban the Bomb movements. Get Rid of Gamma Guns coming up real soon now. 

No. The Mongolians were successful because they hi-jacked an existing Chinese empire and culture. There was a written language, administrative and bureaucratic institutions, other State institutions, and a body of people who had the skills and knowledge to run an empire. Mongolian culture didn't bring anything to the table that would have sustained a Mongolian equivalent of China. The Mongols had none of the institutional structures or personnel to build or run an empire in themselves. That was in the 13th century CE, essentially 4,000 years earlier a Mongol invasion and occupation of the lands that were to become China wouldn't create an earlier version of China. The Mongols were horseback barbarians, certainly this was something they were extremely good at, but they lacked the capacity for running settled communities over large areas of territory. The institutions, agriculture and population weren't there four millennia for them to build Mongolized China. 

Astronomers seem to have already done a reasonable amount of mapping of the galaxy. See here, here and here. Admittedly locations on the far side will have moved. On average everything will have shifted 37.333 light years over the 56,000 year time difference between our observations and what is on the far side now. That's enough to make easy ball part corrections. If humans did have a one-way ticket to the far side of the galaxy, provided there was sufficient time before their departure it is very promising that good approximate maps could be made. Either by conducting extensive surveys, compiling existing information about the galaxy, and integrating this into useful galactic maps. Remember the use of maps would be supplemented by interstellar navigation. Also, if it becomes too difficult we might be able to ask those who issued the one-way ticket about to find our way around (assuming they're familiar with the galaxy's far side). 

This is a deeper version of a similar underground system of bunkers beneath Washington, DC. Therefore, the simplest place for your proposed bunker would be a deeper and bigger version of the existing bunker for top-level government survivors, possibly, a mile deep and below the nation's capital. To complete their inaccessibility a mechanism needs to be in place to prevent unwanted people gaining entry to the base. Explosive demolition of the entry paths and/or lift shafts (of course, you guys call them elevators) can do the trick. The base is basically only a bigger and better version of an existing facility. Best to simply go deeper and bigger. 

Taking into account your last bullet point, buildings could be designed & built to descend below ground level during super-powered slugfests. Then raised above after the dust has settled. Big spaces below buildings, hydraulics, lots of electricity, and improved elevator machinery will do the trick. The citizenry will retreat to conveniently provided underground bunkers that will be fitted out like shopping malls with adequate wi-fi and telephony to enable business as usual to continue. Large TV screens will be mounted on the walls of corridors to let the bunkered populace to watch Superdude and Dr Evil slug it out. Once the battle is over, an all-clear will be sounded. The doors to the bunkers opened. City buildings will commence rising above ground level as their gigantic elevator machinery swings into action. Insurance corporation executives will breathe a collective sigh of relief. Dr Evil will be languishing in his favourite holding cell for the criminally super-powered. All this can be put down to the ingenuity of civil engineers, architects, city planners, and the generous contributions to fund these super-powered slugfest countermeasures from the insurance industry. 

You don't have to design prisons to facilitate suicide. The suicide rate in prison is always extremely high. Prisons have to be designed to prevent prisoners from committing suicide. There are procedures to prevent prisoners committing suicide. The answer is easy. Read the literature on how prisoners commit suicide and make sure the features and methods for suicide are readily available by the score. Make sure those features are such that prisoners can commit easily. You don't need special facilities, gadgets or poisons, special rooms or whatever. Let prisoners keep their belts and shoe laces. Ensure there are lots of hooks and do-hickeys for attachments or clothes hooks or similar and they'll do the rest. This is part and parcel of what happens in prisons in the real world. There's no need to fantasize about adding death dealing devices. Prisons are killing machines enough. They drive their inmates to self-destruction. If you want prisoners to suicide, just look the other way and they'll do the rest. Most of the other answers seem to be written by people who haven't had to look into the abyss. This in some ways is your good fortune, but it robs you of the understanding of the terrible price even the loss of a single human being bring in its wake.
