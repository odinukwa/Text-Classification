Are we dreaming? Case-by-case analysis. Yes: Everything is a dream, ephemeral, temporary, constantly changing, and there is no inherent "existence" that is "radiated" by other "things" in this "world" (time x space) apart from our "own" mind. No: This is not a dream, this is "real life" and independent of "mind" or "awareness" there will always persist an existence, which is generated by "others" in the environment, and no product of "personal" awareness/intelligence/sentience. This topic is difficult to address with experimental science because we have affirmed some observer/observee obstacles to overcome in making experiments. Generally: Science assumes that the human being is an unbiased, observer-on-the-sidelines, basically looking in through a window at "the world" and making talk of its "physics" However, the view of the "observer" is actually biased, since the observer is necessarily part of the universe that s/he studies and observes. It is like a knot in the thread, trying to untie itself. How can you understand, truly, if "you" is dreaming, or if "you" is part of a coherent, greater reality? Well, you should not rule out the simultaneity of yes/no, and the non-possibility of simultaneous yes/no, either. These questions transcend the foundational assumptions of Science and Philosophy, and it is perhaps more intuitive to adopt a "flexible" set of fundamental thoughts, since it seems like we really want to talk about Awareness. How Aware is one of a dream? You may be engaged in it quite forcefully, invested all your "chips" and have many Possessions, Achievements, Feelings and Thoughts all within this "sand box reality." Then, one wakes up and all understanding of gain, all benefits stemming from self-concern (concern for personal wealth, personal happiness) go poof. Gone. The "memory" may persist, but in reality there was nothing "real" about the dream. Maybe it hurts to be apart from personal happiness, but really it shows something very interesting: Based on our observation of the situation, our feelings changed. If we could understand the deeper truth of how Dreams/Reality inter-played, perhaps we could understand more about how Reality/"Beyond" might inter-play. Since, if Reality is a dream, there should be something that transcends it in all directions... When one "wakes up", perhaps a similar "poof" may occur to all our cravings and attachments (all our foundations of personal/self-awareness). We are constantly confronted with the self/non-self duality in daily life: we are a consistent, rhythmically breathing piece of the greater universe, yet we feel separated at large. Really, we observe from a "personal" point of view, but the universe itself is still greater than us all, and certainly contains "us". We are all of the same fabric, and all teammates playing for the same team. Perhaps it is a strange dream... If it is a dream, how does one wake up? Well, this "awakening" is commonly referred to as "Enlightenment" and it is said to come from a deep inner understanding of the "true nature of things" -- to really understand yourself as a harmonious part of the universe, to not view others as "others", and to really come to grips with the transience/temporary nature of "life". One knows "Enlightenment" like one would know Hot and Cold -- it is perhaps one of the few desires founded on wisdom and it is the desire to "liberate the mind." How does one get there? What does it mean? Welcome to the Matrix, here are your introductory pondering questions; try and resist the urge to cover them with thoughts and words (be "silent" in there!), and let the "self" contemplate these things in the tranquility of the peaceful, unobstructed mind: Everything changes. Nothing is permanent. Around you, there is infinite creation and infinite destruction in every moment. Happiness is actually awesome. "I" strives to be happy and understood. True happiness comes from within, since all originates from the "mind" and this "observational" point of view. Consider that you can reflect negativity or happiness to the environment and those around you. Stuff you reflect gets reflected back eventually. Continuity of the "one" object. We say the universe is made of pieces-parts, but really, you could never just delete a planet from the universe and still call it the universe. You'd compromise the "structural integrity" in a way, but really you would be changing a lot in order to make sure one planet got "deleted" because it's all part of one continuous flow, and you'd need energy that was somehow "extra" energy -- energy that was beyond all the types of energy our universe is used to. Something that could both ease the flow and "remove" things... Divisions of objects/things: Every "object" that one can identify is just an agreed-upon convention for naming/communicating. Really, at any instant, you can't say that "you" is made of the same atoms, feelings, thoughts, or state of mind. Everything is in flux, so where is "you"? Where is any object? It is founded in the mind, and if you get good at watching/observing your own mind, you can start to understand the "formation" of desires and the "formation" of perception of objects (reification). Understanding that the observer is still a part of the "observed" is a good place to start in trying to attain the insight you want, I think. Everyone's approach is different, although sometimes there is significant overlap in coming to "true understanding" between people and methods. Really, the process of living is finding out which method is right for you. If you hear something wise, and believe it to be so, do not discredit it due to the source. A dog's bark might enlighten you one day, you never know what your spark, what your trigger may be. The more you contemplate it, the more you will be able to explain to others your ideas. Really, you should be patient until you feel like you've found the right question to ask. Even if you have access to omniscient wisdom, it's all about asking the right questions. 

The simulation hypothesis seems to be the foundation of science itself: by examining phenomena (that are all transient, everchanging, non-permanent and therefore temporary) we attempt to derive a conclusion about the "true nature of things." This naturally falls apart when you observe that it is possible that there are no things. On the grounds of Ockham's Razor, one is tempted to agree with your friend because even the assumption that we are conscious and able to philosophize (for lack of a better term) is quite a stretch. Truly, if all conscious beings were able to observe reality from a standpoint so clear and tranquil that there was no perception of "time" then there would be no perception of "logic" or "reason" and subsequently no perception of a "simulation." How is it possible to perceive the absence of time? If you consider that all action is momentary and fleeting, and -- as the Buddhists would say -- relinquish attachment to anything but the present moment, you begin to dwell in an awareness that is outside the scope of the simulation hypothesis. To answer your question, is it outside the scope of science? Most definitely. Science is based on observable phenomenon, and it would be impossible to "view from outside" that which is only measurable (and only exists, so-to-speak) from within. does it pose a problem for scientific realism? No. It is like suggesting that sweetness is a problem of sugar. They are inextricable traits from the point of view of the observer. is it an empirical question? In my understanding, empirical implies that we can measure and use alternative forms of matter to label/identify/communicate/ and express a meaning or quantity -- is it possible to measure the vastness of the ocean as a fish? Really, one takes for granted the assumption that there is some physical, unchanging "root" of things to which perception can hold on to. Notice that everything changes, that nothing stays the same, and that sentience typically clings to that which it believes to feel good and avoids that which it believes to feel bad. To say that the simulation has an inherent existence is to confuse the will and desire to avoid pain and pleasure with the "will" of the environment. Truly, they are separate. Yet, they are also one -- thanks to the "bridge of perception" if you will. What negative consequence does the idea of a simulation imply, exactly? A simulation is simply a false, transparent cover of something. Whether this is "good" or "bad" is up to interpretation by you. Really, the word "simulation" is just a label. It describes not the true nature of reality because the layer you are trying to talk about is far "below" the layer of words and description. This sentence is really part of the harmonious and rhythmic breathing of the universe -- "information" is continuous. What is "observed" is not the frames, but the "movie" that exists as we cling to the familiar, on both conscious and subconscious levels. Really, the film is a series of frames that exchange places. If you were to study one frame, you would see a static picture. If you were to watch the movie, you enjoy a continuous stream of slightly-changing phenomena, such that you can perceive and understand a story, a plot, an emotion or feeling. Really, perception is the most basal tie we humans have to understanding the true nature of things. Perhaps, instead of asking "is this a simulation?" one might find more wisdom in pondering "what is a simulation?" Truly, you will only be satisfied with an answer once you have had the internal insight of wisdom and understanding. To communicate my view is simply to hope that it stirs your subconscious into curiosity about that which is often observed-as-totality. Love and Wisdom :) 

It is true that you must relinquish all attachment. This cultivation is part of The Way (to enlightenment) and you should keep in mind that the body is an attachment only released at natural death. Nonetheless, you must relinquish not only "attachment" but also attachment to the act of relinquishing attachment. How? The understanding comes from insight and wisdom, which harmoniously develop together as you read, contemplate, and meditate the teachings and your own situation. Really, the idea of "attachment" is at its very base concern for self. As you live more selflessly, and thrive in the happiness of other sentient beings, it will be easier to detach, as you will increase awareness and mindfulness. There are the precepts, which hold you from wordly and gripping attachments. By holding the precepts you are slowly released from karmatic bonds that would otherwise prevent you from even being able to understand and look for meaning in the Dharma. Naturally, you are experiencing a clarity of mind that is well-afforded by virtue and merit, and you should continue to cultivate. What does it mean to cultivate? In order to relinquish all attachment, one strives with vigilance to see all marks as no marks. One also strives to relinquish all attachment that is visible from the 'ego' or 'self'. The Buddha taught Dharma because although one is capable of relinquishing attachment to what one directly "observes," one is incapable of relinquishing that which one does not know she/he is clutching. Your fist is clenched very tightly and you are holding something. Oh, what a grip! It is impossible to let go. Imagine your surprise when your fist unclenches and there is nothing there. In a similar way, one clings to perception. The "information" from your eyes, nose, tongue, ears, body, and thoughts (as well as emotions) is ephemeral (temporary). It all passes because it all changes. Everything changes and nothing is permanent. To contemplate these thoughts is to contemplate Dharma. How does one let go of "attachment" ? How do you let go of "letting go" ? "Letting go" is just a concept. Really, there is nothing to let go of because you are not holding on to anything. The Buddha taught that our clinging is a consequence of Doubt, which arises from causes and conditions. Doubt is not real, and in trying to avoid doubt (rather than investigate it and understand that it is empty) sentient beings cling to that which feels good and comfortable, and avoid that which is "bad" or feels uncomfortable. Truly, the more comfortable you get at understanding that nothing is comfortable or uncomfortable, the more you will see. Really, the attachment to physical objects is coarse. It is several steps removed from the very basis of attachment, yet they are the same entity. It is all one entity and it is all no entity, because there is no entity. Words do not suffice to explain concepts which are only truly received and understood at levels "between frames of time" -- as it is necessary for you to observe this "in motion" in order to understand what it "means," but the understanding and wisdom that liberates comes from within. True attachment is not only the physical world -- it is the conceptual world, the emotional world, the perceptual world. Consider that you are sitting at a "desk" -- really it is no desk at all, it is just materials aligned in a configuration -- but again there is no material, it has no inherent existence of its own. It is constantly in flux and always changing, and your attachment to the label of "desk" is merely an attachment. Naturally, we cannot deny the reality around us, but we can strive toward understanding that it is all one fluid. Then, pondering that there is no fluid, that we are the fluid. Understand that there is no separation between "self" and "other" because we are all one fluid. With the motivation to be happy and free of attachment, to be free of suffering, it will become more and more effortless to see, feel, understand, and speak true Dharma. Patience in the ways of suffering is of measureless virtue and merit. Your mind is brilliant -- like "a blue sky filled with white light" -- but it cannot answer a half-baked question. No matter how correct, if you don't know what you are asking then no answer will be of use to you. Thus, I recommend working with what you are trying to wrap your head around at the moment, and letting the true question form over time. In my case, I have found it helpful to ponder and meditate on such things as "What is attachment?" -- work with your mind to perceive and exist in the current singular moment. There is present, past, and future, as is taught in Buddhism, but really you cannot ever truly dwell in the "past" or catch up to the "future" because all concepts are attachments. When leaving the world of concepts, recall your ambition to feel happy and to "embrace" liberation. We are all one intellect, striving to unify. May we all, in the last words of the Buddha (really the physical body is just a form, and death is a transformation), strive with vigilance. love and wisdom, my friend and eternal brother.
