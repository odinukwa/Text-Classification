For the list, read Collapse by Jared Diamond. The short answer is that yes, premodern cultures definitely experienced man-made environmental disasters. Perhaps the number one cause of these was deforestation. For example, the Rapa Nui people of Easter Island cut down trees in order to build and manouevre the moai (which were huge stone statues with outsized heads). The moai were supposed to gain the Rapa Nui favour with the gods, to the end of obtaining good harvests, among other things. However, the deforestation led to soil erosion, which led to worse harvests. They responded by building more and bigger statues, which meant yet more deforestation. In some ways, modern technology makes us more exposed to the risk of man-made catastrophes. Imagine if the Rapa Nui had had chainsaws! You don't have to look very hard to find similar wanton destructiveness in modern times. However, the Rapa Nui's lack of scientific insight made them more vulnerable to anthropogenic environmental disasters than we are. There was no-one saying 'hey, maybe stop cutting down trees?' and they were unable to connect moai building and their bad harvests. Maybe we won't be wise enough to make analagous deductions, and maybe we will. 

According to this book, in ancient Rome a saviour was treated as a 'second father'. Unfortunately google books cuts you off when you get to the relevant bit. The Wikipedia article about Fabius has the following quote: 

In 1969, detente with either the PRC or USSR lay in the future. All three countries were hostile towards one another. Was the USA pleased its two rivals were tearing lumps out of each other, or were they scared because of the possibility of a nuclear war? Did they officially support the claims of either side? 

In David Leip's political atlas, it says that 'Communist' gained 32 votes in the 1876 presidential election. The name of the candidates and the state where these votes were counted doesn't appear. Of course 32 votes isn't many, but I'm surprised even the word was in use back then. Is this website kosher? 

They made up rhymes, of course! See page four here for an example (Google books makes it awkward to copy and paste) $URL$ 

Never, because there was always a population of human ancestors. You can try to pinpoint an exact moment to call them human (i wouldn't bother) but whenever you choose, there will always be enough that someone died. 

With a caveat, I'd say "yes." The caveat is that there is no doubt that undemocratic violence and voter intimidation twisted the results somewhat (citation: Richard J. Evans, The Coming of the Third Reich, Penguin Press, New York, 2004), especially in the elections that brought him to power. His total of the vote would not have been as high without this violence. As to the point others make above about Hindenburg appointing him chancellor and bowing to pressure, especially from the millions of SA troops, I'd say that that's an undemocratic aspect to a democratic system. In the same way, America today has a news media with massive power to place or destroy candidates, and does so due to political pressure, financial incentives, all sorts of undemocratic reasons. This is undemocratic, but we don't claim unanimously that our political leaders all came to power undemocratically (?). To the extent that violent voter intimidation exaggerated Hitler's showing at the polls, that was indeed an undemocratically-won portion of the vote. However, I haven't seen any sources that show that he wouldn't have won enough to make a right-wing coalition, if he hadn't had that extra bit of phony, undemocratic help. 

As others note, it's a creditable effort from a journalist who actually lived for a time in the Third Reich, but is far from a historian's masterwork. Shirer was limited especially in his primary sources, I think. Many leading Nazis such as Goering, Goebbels, Himmler, Heydrich, Bohrmann, Hitler himself, and others, didn't survive the war, or at least not for long (Goering died in 1946). However, many important figures did, and they proved invaluable sources for historians, though one must always take caution about taking their utterances at face value. A great example of that is Canaris, the biography of the head of one of the Third Reich's secret intelligence services, by Heinz Hoehne. Hoehne had great access to several important figures (although he also seemed to have been seduced by them into judging Canaris as harshly as the people he interviewed did). As time has gone by, those historical figures have died or become harder to interview, but at the same time, what other documentary sources there are have become more available. A really magisterial work is Cambridge Professor Richard Evans' trilogy of books (The Coming of the Third Reich, The Third Reich in Power, and The Third Reich at War). He gives you a ton of detail on the whole regime, with a great balance between person-on-the-street diaries, internal Nazi hierarchy machinations, and the regime's interaction with other nations, during both war- and peacetime. He lacks a little of Shirer's natural talent for dramatization, but not too much; I was happy to read each of these large-ish books from cover to cover. Happy studying! 

Because their ships weren't up to very long sea voyages, particularly if they didn't know where they were going. The coast of northwest Africa is dangerous. The Portuguese called part of it the Cabo Bojador, which means the Cape of Fear. They didn't manage to get past that until the 15th century. The Romans were nothing like as sophisticated in terms of navigation. You probably have a mental image of Renaissance-Europe ships, and of Ancient Roman ships. What's the difference? Well, a lot of things, but pertinently Roman ships needed oars as well as sails. On the other hand, Columbus and co didn't need galley slaves, and that's not because they were squeamish about slavery. 

*By Western Christendom I mean non-Orthodox, non pagan, non-schismatic, non-Muslim controlled societies. So everywhere from Lagos to Lapland. By divorce, I mean that the law recognises that two people used to be in a legally valid marriage, but are no longer married. So, eg Henry Tudor doesn't count, because his marriage to Catherine of Aragon was annulled, and therefore (retroactively) never legally valid in the first place. Or according to the Vatican's perspective at the time, he was legally married to her until she died, and was therefore a bigamist. Edit: Oh, and I know divorce existed in Roman times. I'm taking about Christan Europe after 1000 AD. 

William and Mary II were England's first (and only) dual monarchs. So for them, either could sign. Philip was not the Sovereign, Mary I was. So only Mary could sign. This was another unique situation; usually the husband would get all the wife's property, which included titles. People were not happy that Mary was marrying the king of Spain, and that was part of the deal. Up to Henry VII, sovereigns always had to grant consent in person. From the time of Henry VIII, monarchs have been able to grant assent by sending a group of privy councillors to do it on their behalf. This became the norm. Apparently the last occassion assent was granted in person was 1854. So in other words, the Queen consort never had any role in granting assent. Either the king had to do it himself, or he could send members of the privy council. 

I think you need to reverse your question: why not kill him? When the death sentence was passed on Bukharin, Stalin's long-neutralised and powerless former rival, Bukharin was allowed to write a short note to his sometime friend. 

I'm not sure whether being captured blunts the definition of "defection" at all, but after Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus' capture, he cooperated with the Soviets completely, even making anti-war propaganda statements for the Soviet Union. 

Most of it was not invented by Hitler at all, but was already beloved by Germany's military and right wing. In World War One, the swastika wasn't used officially, but was unofficially painted on the sides of German tanks and aeroplanes; the Iron Cross went back a century; the death's-head insignia that the SS adopted can be seen on the shakos of a German unit called the Imperial Death's-Head Hussars; the red, white and black color scheme of the Third Reich's flags were the same colors as Imperial Germany's (and there was quite a lot of discussion between the world wars about which colors the flag should be, with a lot of contempt from the right wing for the red, white and gold of Weimar Germany); and the eagle was a long-standing symbol of Germany. So it isn't actually as if Hitler or his satraps thought "hey, we should bring back this thing from history." All of these icons had already been well-established in German military and right-wing circles throughout the imperial and Weimar years, through the time when Hitler came to power. 

No--in fact, many people even near the top of the hierarchy, such as Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the Amt Ausland/Abwehr secret intelligence service, never joined the Party at all. Same with those who weren't military, such as Ernst Heinkel, who was one of the Third Reich's most famous aircraft manufacturers and designers. 

The Red Orchestra (so code-named by the Gestapo, in contrast to the Black Orchestra, which were German conservatives against Hitler) were among the most famous communist resisters of Hitler and the Nazis. Some of their members, such as Harro Schulze-Boysen, were military soldiers or (in Schulze-Boysen's case) Luftwaffe-men operating in occupied eastern Europe. Schulze-Boysen was credited by the Gestapo with causing the deaths of a number of Gestapo spies during the Spanish Civil War because, as the Gestapo later found out, he was passing on their names to the leftist soldiers in the war (see Canaris by Heinz Hoehne, New York: Cooper Square Press, 1999, 241-2). Schulze-Boysen and fellow conspirators Hans and Hilde Coppi were working in Poland in 1942 when the Oberkommando des Heeres (Army High Command), having deciphered their secret communications with Moscow, arrested them. Boysen, the Coppis, another co-conspirator, Arvid Harnack, and Harnack's wife were all put to death. 

Yep, this is fine. In addition to mainland-based press gangs, the Royal Navy pressed merchant sailors including American sailors until the end of the War of 1812. The Carribean, of course, lies between Europe and North America, so perhaps an American pressed man would be particularly likely to end up there. 

If your character is going to the British Library, I can tell you how they store newspapers which they never bothered to film. I went there to read the news magazine Cavalcade, and the magazines are all bundled up together in hardbound books, one per year. The binding looks old, like it was done back in the 30s when they came out. 

There was probably no such person. He made the man up to make a general point, though similar people existed, and it's likely Orwell met them. I admire Orwell and agree with the political beliefs he expressed, about the Communists, and many other things. He was, however, a liar. His autobiographical work, Down and out in Paris and London, was at least half made up. When he returned to England, he resumed his lodgings and his writing career, but in his book he said that he was living as a tramp for several more months. He said that he was present in France for the execution of two anarchists on dubious grounds, but he was really on a boat travelling home from Burma. I learnt this from the Complete Works of George Orwell Volume 1, edited by Peter Davison. Later writers have mostly been generous towards Orwell. His lies were not told to make himself look good, or to besmirch his enemies, so he has that in mitigation. However, he was still lying, and it's likely that this was a lie too. 

First, what is an official attitude, and did one exist in Williamite England? In modern times, governments try to influence public opinion by the use of spokesmen in democracies, and propaganda in dictatorships. They have a 'line' on this or that issue which they repeat, hoping to make it catch on. I suppose this is what you'd call an official attitude. Some countries go to the lengths of writing an official version of history which no one is allowed to deviate from, but most democracies don't go that far. In the 17th and 18th century, both monarchs and proto-dictators like Cromwell did a fairly poor job of controlling public opinion in this way. Public opinion was anywise a new invention: the public had no opinion until newspapers were invented and told the public what their opinion was. The official attitude was mostly expressed negatively, through the suppression of material believed to be subversive. Pre-publication censorship persisted until 1695. Contra the comments to the question above, free speech was not yet a secure principle. British constitutional history, unlike American, doesn't have many bright lines. The Glorious revolution had increased religious freedom, but less so political. Even after the licencing act lapsed, it was still possible to get arrested for something which displeased powerful people, through the sedition or libel laws. William and Mary did not use this power to suppress praise of Cromwell. Although they didn't want to associate themselves with a regicide, there were obvious parallels between the rebellions against Charles I and James II. Both were Stuarts, both were friendly towards Catholics, both tried to do without parliament. In his own time and after, Cromwell has always been an ambiguous figure among republicans. He was England's only identifiable leader who was not a king. However, he took on kingly airs such as a sceptre and royal sounding title, and suppressed attempts to establish a democratic state. Moreover, after the chaos and bloodshed of the civil war, people no matter what their political beliefs were very determined that the peace, order and prosperity of the Restoration period should be preserved. After the Stuarts' Restoration in 1660, Cromwell's name had been traduced. Even his dead body was defiled. If the House of Orange had joined in with that, they basically would have been admitting that the deposed Stuarts were the rightful rulers of England. Likewise if they had robustly defended Cromwell, they would have revealed themselves as lawless usurpers, just like him. It was best to just gloss over him as much as possible. If there had been a large number of works praising Cromwell, William and Mary might have been forced to reckon with Cromwell and make a decision one way or the other, but this didn't happen. A modern analogue is the pacto oviedo in 20th century Spain, which means the pact of forgetfulness. After the return of King Juan Carlos, Spain agreed not to pursue claims of revenge or justice against either side in the civil war, and instead to just put the whole thing to bed. A similar thing happened in contemporary England. There were a few diehard republicans, but they were left unmolested because they had no prospect of achieving a return to Cromwell's system, or to anything still more radical. This may sound like William and Mary were just burying their heads in the sand. If they were, it worked. Pressure for reform remained, but no serious attempt to establish a republic was ever made again.
