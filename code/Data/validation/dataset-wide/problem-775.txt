The same celestial objects (stars, planets, the Moon) could be seen every year. So, people figured out there was a pattern to it. At first, geocentrism was prevalent due to prejudice and the stars "orbiting" the Earth in a clean manner (no strange effects). If you stare up at night, stars move in a circle with the center approximately at the Pole Star. This can be mistaken for the Star moving around the Earth. Objects like visible planets (with retrograde motions) were relatively small in number — we have the inner solar system plus Jupiter and Saturn, so people gave plausible explanations for these. Ptolemy theorized that the planet orbits around a "ghost point", for example: 

There can be stars (and small star systems). Stars need not be found only in galaxies. There can be gas clouds. Most nebulae are in intergalactic space. Indeed, for a while, both galaxies and nebulae were termed as "nebulae" until the differing nature of galaxies was discovered. Almost any (small) structure that can be present in a galaxy can be present in intergalactic space, for that matter. Black holes (neutron stars, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, ... ), star clusters, star systems, etc can all be present. Finally, there's a very rare (rare in the density sense) plasma, mainly of hydrogen, that makes up almost all of the intergalactic medium. Zero pressure is an unattainable ideal case. 

The detailed outline of the theory can be seen here: $URL$ I hoped that some answer's here can suggest plausible alternative theories. In particular: 

The most straightforward approach is to use a so-called Hertzsprung-Russell diagram: stars of a given mass "burn" in a fairly predictable way, so by looking at a star's spectrum and luminosity one can infer its possible age. $URL$ Wikipedia also has an overview of some additional methods: $URL$ 

Yet, it is Earth that seemingly misses a great deal of atmospheric volume. So the question is: what are the current theories regarding the "thinning" of the Earthian atmosphere? When and why the atmospheric gases had left the planet? 

During the formation phase, all inner planets had captured as much gas as they could hold per gravitational/thermodynamic equilibrium. After all, even puny Mars managed to capture a sizable atmosphere. The rate of atmospheric escape should be much higher for Venus: 

Yes. It does not rotate uniformly though, different portions have a different angular velocity (as a body made of plasma, it can get away with this). Measuring this in theory is pretty easy, we just need to track the motion of the sunspots. This isn't as simple as calculating the changes in relative positions of the sunspots, though, as the Earth is rotating and revolving, which makes the calculations harder. This measurement can be done using the celestial sphere (the field of stars that we see) as a "fixed" reference point and seeing how the Earth and the sunspots move relative to that. Almost everything in the universe rotates/revolves, at least a little bit, because angular momentum is hard to get rid of. It can be transferred from body to body, but for a body to end up with zero angular momentum, it needs to meet another body with the exact same angular momentum and collide with it in a particular way. Given that this is pretty rare, all celestial bodies rotate. In addition to that, a non rotating body that is revolving will eventually start spinning due to tidal forces. 

"Plate tectonics" have probably nothing to do with the composition and parameters of the present day atmosphere. As far as I know nobody had ever suggested that mantle can re-absorb gases from the atmosphere - on a contrary, gases released from a cooling mantle through a volcanic activity should contribute to a more denser atmosphere (clearly, this process never helped Mars and is not helping Earth that much either). Volcanic gases are mostly composed of CO2 and water vapor (up to 90% by mass), while those two substances are hardly present in the modern day atmosphere (CO2 - ~350ppm, vapor - 0.4%, mostly from evaporation unrelated to volcanic recycling). Comets are relatively lite objects (a decent comet weighs 10000-100000 times less that even a thinnish, present day Earthian atmosphere) with low density. High kinetic energy impact of a comet with a planet will most probably result in escape of the majority of comet contained gases back into space (and impact heating will also add some of the planetary gases to the escaping mix - a process known as "impact erosion"). It is long believed that no substantial matter transfer is possible between comets and planets ($URL$ "Early thin atmosphere" - atmosphere being eroded or lost shortly after Earth (Moon) formation is not plausible for the obvious reason: where does the limestone/coal comes from? If Earthian atmosphere was lost and then replenished through tectonic activity this brings us to back to an original question. 

Primoridial black holes can be found (hypothetically; there is no experimental evidence yet) of any small size above the Planck mass. Stellar black holes, however, cannot have a mass below the TOV limit (1.5 to 3 solar masses) There does seem to be an upper limit1 of 50 billion solar masses. However, I suspect2 that this takes into consideration formative constraints (i.e. the constraints posed on the formation of such a BH); and does not prohibit such a black hole from existing. After all, the Schwarzschild metric certainly does not impose limits on the size of a black hole. Note that talking about the limiting dimensions of a black hole is slightly meaningless as the dimensions change in different reference frames. It is far easier to talk about the mass of a black hole; the radius can be calculated in various frames from that information. 1. Natarajan, P. and Treister, E. (2009), Is there an upper limit to black hole masses?. Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 393: 838–845. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13864.x 2. but cannot confirm yet; I will have to read the paper more thoroughly 

Earth had formed with an atmosphere similar or denser than Venusian. Its most abundant ingredient should have been CO2 (analogously to Venus and Mars). Earthian atmosphere managed to cool down enough for water to start condensing into liquid phase. The exact mechanism for this is not quite clear to me (Goldilocks zone notwithstanding) because hot and dense CO2/H2O atmosphere should have caused a prominent "green house" effect, preventing the planetary surface from cooling down (unless "green house" effect models are too exaggerated). Atmospheric CO2 started to dissolve in liquid water (this alone would account for about 50% reduction in partial CO2 pressure). Strongly acidic water started to erode calcium from the crust, kick-starting the limestone formation process. Emerging life had accelerated the process, sequestering the remaining atmospheric CO2 into the gigantic limestone and somewhat smaller coal deposits. 

That's the part of the universe that is visible to us right now. In other words, we map it from light we receive from that zone right now, so the part being mapped is actually many, many years old. Usually this doesn't make a big difference because we're careful to analyze regions where the variation in the time of viewing is not large compared to the length scale. Actually, from the relativity point of view, it's almost as good as the faraway bodies being in the state they were billions of years ago as far as we are concerned. From our reference frame, they may have a "future" (really, the "present", but calling it that gets a bit icky) but we just have no way of knowing it. 

the circular area around the Earth is more or less the area (there's a velocity dependence here which I'm not getting into) in which a moon-like body can form a reasonably stable orbit. The size of the small "well" will increase as the planet moves farther from the sun, and also when the planet is more massive. Jupiter is both pretty far away from the Sun, and is very massive. This leads to a huge sphere of influence. The asteroid belt may have something to do with this too, but I doubt it (it's pretty far away). However, if we assume the "half-baked planet formation" theory for the formation of the belt, Jupiter may have leeched off much of the mass that would have otherwise become part of that planet during the formative period. 

Venus is somewhat lighter then Earth, yet has a much thicker atmosphere. One would imagine that the following should be true: 

It so appears, there exist surprisingly little solid theories as to why Earth and Mars managed to lose the majority of their atmospheric gases, while Venus had managed to retain a most magnificent atmosphere. One plausible theory was put forward by a prominent chemist Octave Levenspiel et alii, based on the old Soviet research into Earthian crust composition conducted in the 1950s (I could not find any substantial updates to the crust composition model developed since that time). At a glance, the theory works as following: 

First, one should observe that water is very abundant in the Solar system and most of it comes from before the planetary formation stage. Even Mercury has got its deal of water, albeit a small one. I think, it will be safer to assume that earth had had it water from the very beginning of its formation. Additional thing to consider are the temperatures, routinely reachable on various planetary bodies. Mars and everything beyond are way too cool for liquid water to exist, but solid water is present there in considerable quantities. Similarly, Venus and Mercury ended up with temperatures above point of water vaporization or even chemical breakdown in the presence of other compounds. Only the Earth happens to occupy a nice orbital zone where water can exist in all 3 phases (solid, liquid and vapor). But it's not something Venus has any effect on. 

Bigger is better. Most moons, especially those of gas giants, are not "formed", they are just "captured" (unlike our Moon, which could have been captured, but probably was formed in a much more exciting way). Jupiter is the most massive planet in the solar system. It stands to reason that it has a larger region of gravitational influence (where its influence outweighs the force due to the other planets and the sun). So, it's easy for it to capture rocky masses. If you have a look at the contours on the following image (Ignore the Lagrange points marked on it, I only want the contours) 

Basically, if two particles are placed with no other interaction between them, the distance between them will increase. Imagine living on the surface of a balloon which is being blown up. Your size stays fixed, because you're more or less rigid, but items not attached to you will move further away. Your ruler, another rigid body, stays fixed in size (though it may bend to accommodate the new curvature — this isn't so important). But two rulers (which are not attached to each other) move further away.
