Perfect information implies every buyer and every seller knows everything in the market. As soon as a firm brings a new product to the market, other firms start selling the same, identical, product. In practice, say a kebab shop comes up with a secret new ingredient and attracts more custoemrs, but as soon as this happens, other shops copy it. Bottomline: any information-advantage is short-lived in perfect competition. This also leads to the other characterisation, all products are homogeneous. If the firms/customers do not possess full information about the market/products, then you should characterise the market differently i.e. oligopoly, monopolistic competition or monopoly. 

There are quite a few books out there, but I found the following books explain the concepts and tools more intutitively: ABCs of RBCs and Economic Growth, maybe then go on to read others. 

I've studied a number of cointegration methods in the past few months. It seems, Johansen's multivariate VAR approach to cointegration is the most commonly used multivariate cointegration technique. Most packages appear to have in-built functions to run "Johansen cointegration analysis". I was wondering if there are other multivariate cointegration methods in the literature though less known and are not available in let's say Eviews, Stata, RATs etc. but can be programmed. 

I have a data set of annual prices of various energy carriers over several decades. I want to estimate a model of output using these price series - I guess, I will do a co-integration analysis. There appears to be a high positive correlation among the price series. 

I am reading a paper, the author takes the derivative of the following equation with respect to $t$: $$ q(t) = \int_t^\infty e^{-r(s-t)}c(s)e^{-\delta(s-t)}ds $$ 

In general, Islamic banking, when fully complaint with sharia law, is the sharing of the risk arising from any financial transaction. It is the sharing of the risk that matters. Both the borrower and the lender should equally benefit from the transaction, and no one party should benefit at the expense of the other. 

I like Introducing Advanced Macroeconomics: Growth and Business Cycles by Sorensen and Whitta-Jacobsen. The text provides intuitive explanation and exposition of models. The book is neither too mathy nor descriptive, I would say, they offer somewhat balanced introduction. A similar question was submitted before, have a look here. 

I tried a slightly different formulation because of the nesting of the Cobb-Douglas function in CES. The evidence pointed out by in previous posts shows that Cobb-Douglas is not an apropriate fit to the data given that there is little potential for $K$ and $L$ to be perfect substitutes. An alternative formulation could be $$Y=[(A_lL^\nu+ A_kK^\nu)^\frac{\sigma}{\nu}+ A_eE^\sigma]^{1/\sigma}$$ However, estimating $\nu$ and $\sigma$ would not be easy due to the nonlinearities in the relationship. Thus, the first formulation was adopted. Any suggestions welcome! Alternative formulation, methods etc. 

Question: Where does this change in quantity demanded come from? Is it from a movement along demand curve, or from a shift of demand curve? 

This shows that the volume of GDP, real output, did not grow as fast. The nominal GDP, on the other hand, gives us false impression that the economy is growing at a faster pace. If you are using the data in statistical or econometric exercises, you should use volume data in constant prices. And, if you are comparing performance across countries, you should convert the data to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP). I think OECD database offers PPP based macro-variables 

Unfortunately, those who are riding the current trend do not have a clue about what they are doing. I guess, they don't even think of hypothetical situations you've given above to legitimise cryptocurrencies, instead, they appear to be enjoying the joyride. If anything, cryptocurrency trading is more like a fantasy share trading with real consequences. As of now, there are 1354 cryptocurrencies. As you suggest, "investors" may have decided that digital currencies are better "(eg because you could avoid tax / minimise transaction costs)". 

I think you can find info on this from 1970s at Yahoo Finance You must, however, do the adjustment yourself by obtaining the CPI inflation from the web site of Office for national statistics. 

Energy and capital are complements. Would be good if you give an example of the situation that puzzled you. There is a growing list of empirical papers that attempt to estimate elasticity of substitution between energy and capital stock. 

In a growth accounting exercise I backed out the time path of technical progress augmenting a factor. Annual growth rate of this factor saving innovation is very close to zero in the last few years. So, its contribution to growth per head diminished. Can we also say, in these later years the augmentation was more like neutral than factor specific? 

I've read a number of posts on the above topic but none refers to published empirical papers. Google searches have been hopeless. Does anyone know of any paper on empirical derivation of technical change indices? A lot of papers use these terms interchangibly, there is a clear difference between them (labour-saving technical change stems from bias in technical chnage). Using some historical data, I am trying to establish if technical change has been labour-saving or labour-augmenting. However, I've yet to read an empirical paper on the topic. 

I don't know what the 'first sign that a country is transitioning from a developing to a developed economy', but I would look at the rates of output growth and study its acceleration. In a layman's words, a transition from low to high income regime requires convergence to a high income teady state. This is only possible if the growth rate of aggregate output, underpinned by improvements in all aspects of the economy, has been consistently higher than that observed in high income (which you call developed) economies. Transition is complete (or the country achieves a 'developed' status) when the economy's growth rate reaches its long run steady state rate (typically low (<2% p.a.) positive growth rate). 

Have you heard about Bhutan's measure of success called Gross National Happiness (GNH)? Several other nations followed suit Bhutan and created their own measure of GNH, given the time I have, I would just recommend you to google "GNH" to find out about an alternative measure. 

You may have read Acemoglu (2002) on the topic of directed technical change. I am reading a similar research paper, and I could not understand how the author derived the final equation using integration. Below are details: Equation A: $Y_L=\frac{1}{1-\beta}\left [\displaystyle\int_0^{N_L}x_L(j)^{1-\beta}\,dj\right ]L^{\beta }$ Equation B: $x_L=\left [\frac{p_L}{\chi_L(j)}\right ]^{1/\beta}L$ Equation C: $Y_L=\frac{1}{1-\beta}p_L^{\frac{1-\beta}{\beta}}N_LL$ where, 

Okay, in layman's words, devaluing yuan (against USD) means, Chinese made goods are cheaper in USD. On the other hand, American made goods are expensive in China as a result. China wants to keep its export competitiveness and may want to keep its 'world's factory' status. Well, South Korea may as well want to use a similar strategy to make domestically produced export goods competitive, similarly, other aisan governments considering devaluing their currencies. There would then be a currency war... hope this is as simple as you wanted to see. 

Answer to your first question Take a look at what Aswath Damadoran uses for his empirical work. He's been teaching applied corporate finance for a little while at NYU. These are his slides. Answer to your second question If you have access to any of the following, you should have no problem getting access to any economic and financial time series.
