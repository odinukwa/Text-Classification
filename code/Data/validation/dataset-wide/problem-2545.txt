There is nothing wrong in being gifted a blessed to be able to accumulate a lot of wealth proper and in rightous earned ways, but it is not wise at all to let go of ones virtue and life at easy for what ever amount of outwardly gain. "Lesser (of certain things outwardly) is more (peace, happiness and ease).", a prover tells. Good results require certain hard work: that's the Noble truth of Suffering, and there is just one way out and proper conduct to continue with most possible ease, if still wishing to wander on, take and pay, before or afterwards. Nearly 24:00 and the sound of hunters gun is to be heared from the near other mountains forests, sometimes just the barking of the deers is the loudest... screeming after a spouse... Make good use of possible highest blessings gained and give causes so that such effects are not only seeked but gained, as sure as birth is followed by death. 

...and of course vizi-versa, one becomes weak, ugly, thin and founds one self lost in a hot wide desert. 

So get up, dreamer, and go for an initiative! [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

Dhammika and interested on reflecting, Coming from a basics-topic here (sadhu to work on it), my person, allows himself, "disturbing" like always, likes to push forward to actions and walk the talk by deeds: Today it's very usual to just speak out ones mind, especially on internet there are less signs of proper behaviour and gesticts of respects, so as to ask for leave or to leave the right position to other present "to be respected people". What does one think might be the longterm consequence of usual respectless speech and not looking for approve of elders and those in front? How to possible infected communities benefical? Is it even possible in modern world and on most communication and exchange places? Does one good if staying, approve and at least, step by step, addopt unskillful ways? (Maybe better leave then to become goodness thief?) (If remembering talks, Suttas and Vinaya-passages (since always a good orientation), they might be surely good placed in addition, respect and Reference.)

"Under friends" VandƒÅmi is a usual, even often just a ritual, practice under devoted lay followers, a homage, asking for pardon and asking for the share of the juwels merits (e.g. father, teacher, Sangha, Dhamma, Buddha) and as it is pointed out in the Vinaya, to confess faults amoung those of equal, is of no use, would not help and support a better, neither for the individual nor for the paticular community (which can possible not helped). [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial use or other low trades and just exchange for the world.] 

Generally in regard of the basic precepts, not to speak about kammic effects, there is no exclusion for Bhikkhus at all and the Vinaya contains aside of "foreign political" and community rules specifical special mentionings of cases where Bhikkhus obiviously had to less objectivity, such as water filter, digging earth... It's importand to understand, that Vinaya rules are for the most cases for very undeveloped minds and wordlings. Whom would one need to tell about issues of being in water, earth or possible endangered by uncontrolled fire... if not someone who is far away from higher virtue and controll of the sense faculties and mind. How to handle things is always a case to case matter, requiring people with lot of knowledge and understanding of Vinaya so that the right kind of offense class is selected. So aside of the Patimokkhas 227 rules, 1000 in Mv and Cv and other books, "countless" other cases need to be deriven form the given set and especially today many have of course real problem. One, like also mentioned in the Suttas, who trains firm in higher virtue, concentration, wisdom, would aside of community and costume rules have no problems at all, sticking firm to the basics and fundamentas precepts. There are those who argue just in literary ways, even thinking (following the words) that Bhikkhus might have more ease than Samaneras for example, or householder and there are also many cases where householder rules are explained by the Vinaya standards, but that is mostly wrong. Vinaya should be seen as addition to the basics to have common min. standards and not as replacements at all. Again, not to speak of kammic effects, where there is no difference in what ever cloth one might wear. Hope that this short explaining could ease in the regards of shock displayed in the question. In cases where a lay person might be really ill willed harmed by a monk it's good and proper, if no backwards need to be feared, to speak out such cases to other trusted monks since it is not good, for anybody, to keep problem, possible also misunderstandings, a burden for good relation. "Sadly" such as "opening the Vihara" is not really broad known and practiced but a good and performed way to clean things up, used here in Cambodia, for example, in the Dhammayut Nikaya. When lay people see grave problems they are given to call for "opening the Vihara" where they then are given to bring up their cases in front of an assembling of monks and possible the involved people. Not that such is a desired and pleasant event, but it is a very good tool for healing and clarify possible misunderstandings as well since it is somehow public. At least one should not forget that a Bhikkhu is not immune and excluded in regard of criminal law for cases where the Sangha is not really capable to handle cases. Beating and serious ill-willed insult are no trivial offence in most counties. Of course it's better to solve it in amicable arrangement but in certain countries one would be even obligated to legally report it.

(Note that the story also reports of a need in mv viii) a, b, c) are seldom met as background of this days deeds. d) is an importand fact that wordly laws even contradict, assuming that beings deeds have to been seen for certain societies benefits. And the fact that something written is most far away from intent and mind quality, if investigating e) and give reality a prove by directly asking, will quickly found out and one will see how less thoughts on licences or thinking in terms of rights actually holds and will bring longer lasting joy. As for a householder there is no real hindrence to simply ask and even a proper deal for a gain is nothing wrong. But if one holds wrong view, thinks in ways of rights, does things with a "Robin Hood" mind setting, putting fruits or expected aims higher as silas, acts in overestimating oneself, without gratitude, even gives to harm others, derive others of their possession, stubborn, in anger, ill willed, attached and with many desireds, in short based on wrong view, and grave moha, what ever material results might be gained, it will neither turn out as real benefit for oneself nor for others but works destructive in many ways for many. How ever pleasant it will appeare for fools. Many do "Dhamma-work" in this way this days, even monks in action and by encouragements in doing so, many are the fools using the Dhamma to uphold their fight and very very less are wise enought to do not either sacrify their potencial either toward their childish defilements nor for those not really worthy of gifts and not even signed for such. If Upasaka Volapor is willing to sacrify toward the Sangha and those following them, in that case here, he may feel given to make a use of it in a proper way. Some infos can be found here and if needing contact emails of certain people proper to ask, Volapor known how and where to approach. Aware that it's not easy to keep an effected mind from touching fire, my person again leave it like this up to ones possible rest of wisdom and goodness. If prefering to be smarter then those walking in front or having arived, it's not possible to help. Generally a maybe useful story for more understanding of how degenerated and similar the standards of hunters an collectors, forest people, modern ways are: Giving, taking and the "new" world Best wishes and success for your good undertakings and actions with good mind setting will naturally have their equivalent results. Something good to trust into rather into defiled visions of fruits and higher aims, serving for actions excuse.
