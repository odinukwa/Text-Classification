My response to this is usually something like, "Let me talk to this other person first, and if necessary, we can call the meeting." Also, if you can solve the problem without the PM, why don't you? An email message to keep the PM in the loop or to ask for permission or a schedule adjustment may be all that is necessary. 

If you don't know, acknowledge it and ask if they want you to research it. Determine if these questions are in the scope of your job and/or the project. Again, you indicate you don't know that, but can find the person who does. Some questions may need a follow-up question. If someone is suppose to approve the design, is that standard operating procedure? Maybe it should be? Where are these kinds of things documented? Beware of Politics What may be going on here is a way to embarrass someone else like your boss. Happens a lot. Do the best you can and get back with your boss to see how she wants to handle it. I've had bosses who wanted to come to my defense in these situations. Others may want to ignore it or take care of it themselves. I suggest you follow their advice. 

Your company doesn't have plans, documentation or follow-up. The CEO should know what projects everyone is working on and how much. Without this, there is no way for the CEO to know what anyone is doing let alone the intern. If the intern is put on a project and the CEO is lead to believe no one else worked on this project, what do you expect? 

This depends on your relationship with your manager. I've had some managers where I would have run into their office on day one and asked if his department had to put up with this stupid rule. With others, I would send an email and explain my circumstances if he wasn't aware of them already (Which a good manager should). You've probably had enough correspondence to know how to be respectful and professional. If you get a response that it is out of your manager's control, you can then mention the discressionry provision. It's difficult to determine how far you can push this issue. Some managers just don't stand up for their team members as much as others. Ultimately, you need to change into something appropriate to wear in your lab to prevent ruining your good clothes or get another job. 

If the people doing the hiring want to base your salary on what they think you need, then it may be a good approach to show your expenses to justify a raise. Not that no one hiring ever considers this, but it is really far down the line in priority for figuring out salaries. It's usually some balance between what the market is for this candidate's qualifications, how this position contributes to the a company's income, and the amount of risk they want to take by paying more or less. Some candidates ask for more or less depending on their understanding of all of these variables along with their level of desperation. Sorry, but if a couple of candidates have the same level of expertise as you do and are willing to work for half the salary, you may not get the job/raise no matter what. Generally, I suggest demonstrating how you are much better than the other candidates and demanding what you can get on the open market. 

Trust your team that they will let you know if they need you. Reinforce the importance of getting this to you ASAP. Maybe that's a trade-off than the daily thing? They're doing good work, but you want them to continuously report on the good work. It seems redudant. You haven't given me a good reason on why they should do it, so I doubt they see it as well. Get out of their way and intervene if and when there is a problem. And I do believe them not letting you know when you need to "pick and continue" would be a problem. EDIT: I've read several comments where the OP has pointed out the team doesn't do any of their written work correctly or on time. Check in code comments are vague fragements. I don't see this as being a problem of just forgetting. If that's the case, a simple daily reminder can be set. The only reason they do it when you call is because they require nagging. Set your limits and punish those that don't keep up. 

Be upfront about the issue in a cover letter. Include information/links to any retractions or evidence of your innocence. Hopefully, more employers will be understandable and will forward this to any research service they are using. Your honesty should count for something. 

It doesn't seem like that big of a deal to just ask her especially with her skill set. Why is this a problem? 

I don't think it is a fair question because most companies, teams, managers have some guidelines on how to go about this kind of thing. Some are written and unwritten. I've worked at places where it was acceptable to pound your fist on the table until you get everyone to hear your point of view. Never give in. Never surrender. At other places, you'd be fired for doing that, so you just agree all the time. So how does my past experience help you when I answer this question? You learn to wait and see how these debates are handled. People like to think they're upfront about this, "I don't want any 'yes' men on my team." except every time someone disagrees, they get yelled at without an rational reason why from management. People have different temperaments and this question may let you know when someone tends to do, but there can be a lot of variability in different settings and circumstances. It's difficult to tell people you prefer a certain type of behavior because they'll just alter their answer in hopes of getting the job. You can try it and see if you can tell who is bluffing or not, but that's pretty difficult most of the time. If getting along with the team is so important, they should spend as much time as possible with job candidates. Hopefully, you can find the answer without asking the question. If someone thinks the question is too aggressive, they may not be a fit for your team either. I like being upfront, so aggressive would not be how I would describe this question. 

Send your thank you email and include the code fix with a small explanation. They can choose to ignore it. 

This is a pretty strong statement. Your team needs to do a better job of accepting criticism and being open to other ideas. That doesn't mean you can't question and ask for an explanation from your manager on why the other idea is better. If the manager still thinks the other idea is better, your team should have agreed to implement it. If all you're going to do is complain because an outside source's idea was accepted, you lose trust with your manager to be willing to do the right thing. That's probably why he's relying on this outside resource to implement the idea instead of letting your group do it. You could equally argue that the team should always go along with their manager. You can disagree or ask for clarification, but at some point a decision has to be made. However you derive the best solution, as long as that prevails, everyone is in a better position to have success. 

Why is project A more important to management than project B? What is the criteria for advancement and how are people evaluated? Employees don't agree with management. Throw out the job titles - what are people really doing on a day to day basis? 

There are several contradications here, so I'm not sure what the problem is. Does your supervisor expect you to stay the full-time on Friday when he/she has already left? This is so pervasive, I don't know how you can feel you're doing anything behind anyone's back. OK, so no one talks about it. Go along with it. If there is such an office cultural contempt for those who don't leave, take off once in awhile. You see someone leaving early, tell them you're right behind them (What does that really mean? You just leave an hor later.). Come in early if you feel like you're not putting in enough time for the week. This is a very strange practice, but may be common where you're from. I say go with it unless your supervisor has a problem. 

You're new and will continue to learn what is appropriate and what is not. Hopefully, you're not the only female in this organization and you'll get plenty of examples of what is considered appropriate. This doesn't mean you shouldn't be aware of what male colleagues do and demand similar treatment. That doesn't mean you have to do things you're not comfortable with. Different customs should be respected in the workforce and not assumed you leave all of your beliefs and conventions at the door. Respect should be mutual and not one sided. 

Send an email Go into the room before the meeting starts and remind everyone to put away things. Go in the room after the meeting and ask people to put away chairs and help out. Get buy-in from management and they need to set the example. If they put chairs away, others will follow. 

You have to decide what you want to get out of this. Is it just a reward/vacation, are you trying to help these people improve as a team? If you want to give them a reward, come up with a budge for money and time and ask them what they would like to do. Team building will take a little more work. I think volunteering or doing some real-world activity is better than some contrived team activities. Instead of trust-falls, go help at a soup kitchen. Load boxes at a food pantry or cleanup a highway. There are many organizations in your area that always need a hand. These activities will require some planning, organization, communication, etc. Depending on the length, you can have a lunch break. Make sure the meals require everyone to be together. It doesn't have to be all work an no play. Leave time for an activity that may be more of a reward. The group should get together and discuss the effort of their teamwork. Share the effort with the rest of a company in a newsletter or something. You've done a good thing; be proud and let everyone know it. 

Have you considered why you chose to be a programmer over othere professions? Your answer may be getting a position where you are not getting to program as much. You may be more in meetings, dealing with client issues, writing specs, managing projects, other people, etc. This is why it is important to have your best coders avoid these things. You may think not getting to code is a rare situation, but it is very common for people who advance up the corporate ladder. 

Your company/manager either just accepts that things will take longer or they need to provide the incentive to this part-time consultant. People working another full-time job are not available and often don't have the energy to put in the extra time you need. Somehow they need to be incentivized and I doubt you have the resources or authority to provide it. To be honest, I'm having a hard time believing that if you spend the 3-5 days actually reviewing the code instead of waiting for an answer, you couldn't be able to do more of this yourself. Repeat this enough times and you should be able to absorb quite a bit. Not surprised your manage hasn't caught on to this. 

The interview isn't a fight, so don't be afraid to smile a little bit as you sit straight-up and confidently tell them why you should get the job. Stick to the responses you practiced, so you are less likely to continue providing more and more information which may lead to stating a negative or lessor quality. Interviewers are busy taking notes and preparing for the next question. There will be some pauses in the conversation. Don't feel like you have to carry the load and keep talking. Another Technique Imagine you are applying for a position, but they ask you in the interview if you are willing to take a much lesser role. How would you respond? If your first thought is "yes", you need more work. 

Face time - just showing up is enough. Strategically connecting with certain people in the firm that you normally don't get to meet. If they don't want to discuss business, this may not be beneficial. Decisions get made. Similar to #2, but may be more direct about a certain project and some action is decided. 

Prepare salary/benefits demands and negotiation - Nothing indicates you believe you are worthy than asking for compensation. It forces you to focus on convincing the employer why they should pay you this much. Do your homework on salaries in your area. Knowledge is power and leads to confidence. Be willing to decline an offer. Prepare counter-offers, but stand firm. Don't give reasons not to pay you (Doesn't that sound a little silly?). Get excited about the job - Why do you want this job and how can you convey how much you want it to the employer? You'll be more confident when you go for something you "really" want. This will make you less likely to be negative. Prepare for the interview. - You've covered your broader qualifications in #1 & #2. It's time to work out the details. Sell yourself. Identify your strengths and work on turning weaknesses into a positive by indicating you are aware of them and make an effort to compensate when needed. Proof everything and look for negatives - No self-deprecation. Needing to drop you kids off at school and needing to arrive to work a little later, is nothing to be ashamed of nor should you think of it as a negative for the company. You're the best candidate, it's not big deal, you'll more than make up for it in other areas. Find the reasons to be confident, so you won't feel like you're bragging or being pushy. Don't feel the need to provide too much information.
