And finally, I would like to remember that even the blitzkrieg did not mean the end of trenches. Troops kept dugging in manholes and pits to lay inside, and, when the front was stable enough, positions were fortified. There was still a deffensive advantage in doing that, because it still meant more casualties and delays to the assaulting troops. They went from being an almost unpassable obstacle to be just another factor in the planning of the battle. 

One word: decadence. Racial and religious tensions were there1 but there was a strong power that kept the status quo (so minorities would not rebel, and Ottomans would not have to use heavy handed tactics to suppress them). And it was not so sudden: check rebellions like the Migrations of the Serbs, the Orlov Revolt, etc. While fighting was not continuous, at no time I would call the situation "pacific". 

The problem was not with the “books” but with the readers. Aristotle, for example, was an extremely creative and self-critical thinker who was very willing to change his mind even on important issues. But the Christian/Muslim/Jewish writers of the middle ages turned Aristotelianism into a dry dogma. In more recent times the self-styled Marxists have done the same disservice to the writings of Marx. 

The general term in Ptolemaic astronomy is kyklos (cycle), which encompasses the epikyklos, the ekkentros kyklos etc. 

Euclid, like other ancient authors, would probably have dictated his books to a literate slave, who wrote them down on wax tables, with a stylus, as Tyler has described. The tablets would then have been passed on to a professional scribe (also a slave), who copied them on to scrolls made of papyrus. 

My proposal has to be considered with a grain of salt, and is earlier than TheHonRose's answer. That said, given the consequences it has had lately, I am a little surprised that nobody has written about transfer of Crimea from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukranian Soviet Socialist Republic, in 1954. Yes, the Ukranian SSR was part of the Soviet Union at the time, but: 

This answer is more political that purely historical; it should have been a comment but I needed the extra space. I believe you are thinking in modern terms: the state-nation, where the people is sovereign and can elect its own form of government. This concept, stablished as it seems, is relatively new (Age of Enlightment, American Declaration of Independence and French Revolution). Before that, the people sheldom was a political subject1 and was considered under the control of a higher, usually military caste. The idea that english people should revolt because they liked Harold better than Edward was like political-fiction at the time (and it is worth noting that it isn't that such people were never asked if they liked Harold in the first place). Even the Roman Empire worked this way, with a tiny nucleus of citizens dominating a mass of non-citizens. In the conquered territories, if the chieftain was amenable to submit and pay taxes they would not interfere with him or they would even support him in dominating his subjects; if the local power caused trouble then they would send in the legions. Later this Roman citizen/non-citizen relationship was changed to a military/civil relationship, with the emperors being so due to its control of the Army. They still used the civilian structures (v.g. Senate) but whenever it became unruly the army would step in to "restore order" When the Germanic tribes took over they did pretty much the same, they simply destroyed / took over the Roman military and replaced it with its own; what was left was already used to obey whoever was in charge. Those power structures left by the Romans (vg. Church, or local chieftains) simply had to negotiate with the new lords which would be the balance of power; some people could not like it and rebel, but those were not "popular" uprisings but rebellions by local leaders2. The conquest of England was more or less the same: take out the top dog, destroy organized opposition and then rule; the main difficulty being that you have to reward your allies with lands so you would need to disposses the previous local nobles (at the risk of the occasional local rebellion). 1: There were rebellions in the Middle Ages or before, but mostly due to lack of food and they sheldom tried to replace the stablished order but to lower taxes and similar situations. 2: The most notorious exception would be the case of religious wars, when the invader was of a different religion. For example, many Germanic tribes found it expedient to convert from Arrianism to Catholicism in order to avoid alienating too much their subjects. 

If with Mesopotamia you mean the ancient civilisations in Babylonia and Assyria before the Persian conquest (that is: before 535 BC), then we need to say that there were no coins at all. In a Mesopotamian context, a shekel is a unit of weight, not a struck coin. The first coins in the world were minted in Lydia around 600 BC. In Babylonia, coins began to circulate during the Persian (Achaemenid) period. 

This depends on what you mean by protest. Mexico was apparently the only country that protested officially to the League of Nations. The Soviet Union condemned the annexation of Austria, of course, as did the Spanish Republic, and (surprisingly) the Vatican. 

You are right, the name Hellenes means “pagans” in the New Testament, and was consequently abandoned by Greek Christians, who preferred to call themselves “Romans”. The term Hellene was revived by the Greek philosopher Giorgios Gemistos Plethon in the 15th century as part of his endeavour to replace Christianity by the “Religion of the Hellenes”. It was revived a second time by the Greek nationalist movement in the 19th century. 

I feel that answers linking crime to ethnicity should at least try to provide some documentation relative to the ethnicity of union ranks. I would say that the factor more important was the use of organized crime (which existed before trade unions) to suppress worker movement. Organized was a more important force in USA than in UK. In the USA, the organized crime intervened often in the laboral relations, with the clear example of the Pinkertons (that, while claiming to be "detectives", were often just band of thugs used to violently break strikes), initially to break strikes and teach "manners" to protesting workers. In this aspect, once the leadership of a (once) demanding trade union was killed, jailed, or beaten enough to renounce their position, it just made sense replacing them with pliable men. Of course, even with the mob controlling the trade unions, the workers need some improvents or there is always the risk of new trade unions being formed by disatisfied workers, so some improvements must be achieved. And, in order to ensure that no other trade union could replace the old one (due to the ineffectivenes of latter), you could make union membership mandatory (which explains the creation of union shops and even closed shops in a country that declares itself "the paradise of free enterprise"). Additionally, trade union outside the protection of "controlled" trade unions continues to be very heavily punished1. Finally, once the mob controls the trade unions, it is not a great leap to search profit (more) from other opportunities that would arise from the situation. In short, trade unions are corrupt because they were assaulted by the organized crime as a mean of forbidding representative trade unions from being formed/effectual. That is not news to the USA, many dictatorships (from Franco's Spain to those behind the Iron Curtain) had trade unions for exactly the same purpose. 1: To illustrate my point, go to this category page in the Wikipedia and click links at random; check how many do include strikers being wounded or killed with nobody being held accountable. NOTE: Yes I see the lack of citations, but the mob rarely makes their business agreements public (and when they do, there is a shocking lack of documental support). Given that, I understand (from what I have seen in previous answers) that there is a bit more leniency in the documentation part. What is real and documented was the mob role (including Pinkertons) against the workers'rights movements, and what happened to the honest leaders that defied them. And well, the other answer include even less citations. 

This question is very vague, but I assume you are asking about the Middle Ages in Western Europe, though there is no reason why it should not be about Byzantium, Islam, India, China or any other mediaeval civilisation. But let us stick to Western Europe. In Western Christendom (and also in Byzantium) the universal system of time-keeping was the Julian calendar. You have asked specifically about “townspeople”. Unlike other respondents to this question, I am not convinced that the majority of the population in mediaeval European towns were illiterate. But literate or not, there is no reason to doubt that they knew what the date was according to the Julian calendar. Merchants (for example) needed to know this. But also in the countryside people needed to know the date so as to plant their crops at the correct time of year. Calendars are very much part of popular culture in all civilisations. And this has nothing to do with newspapers. 

So, any attempt to build an underground would have probably ended with just a flooded holes in the ground. UPDATE: Searching for more info I found this geological map of Chicago. It seems to point that most of the area underground is formed by "beach ridges, sands and gravel"; maybe someone with knowledge about geology could inform us if this confirms the fears of water filtration for underground structures. 

Yes those are somewhat less enthusiastic but I think the extra info is worth it, we should not forget that: 

More of an economic answer than historical, but yet... The answer is that it would change very little. Two factors: 

And, when introduced, those solution did work! But usually they were used first in small, test attacks1, which gave the enemy enough time to recognize the threat and adapt their defenses. Add to this the natural tendency towards confirmation bias (or simply optimism). The front was not totally static, small advances were made, and confirmation bias made commanders believe: 

Your question is like asking whether Americans like Trump. The answer – in both cases – is: some do and some do not. A part of the Austrian population – disturbingly, a rather large part – think that Hitler was a fine chap and that the conquest of Austria by Germany was just marvellous. Others, perhaps still the majority, think that the “Anschluss” was a national catastrophe. As I wrote in the comments, all of this has nothing to do with “The Sound of Music”. In general, Austrians are not impressed by that movie. That has nothing to do with any supposedly political content of the film, but with the fact that it invokes a stereotyped, sentimentalised picture of Austria; it is in fact what in German is so nicely called Kitsch. The last time I was in Salzburg a rather tedious English lady impressed on me that I should visit the Trapp family villa. I told her that I would rather pay my homage at Mozart’s birthplace. 

The main interest of the Union was to stop secession, not the freedom of slaves, to the point that compromises were sought with the Southern states. As the OP states, the Emancipation Proclamation was a wartime measure. By itself it could be read as "the enemy's economy is based in slavery, let's ruin that economy". 

More than a question of Soviets/no soviets (which is a mostly internal affair), the situation is that the USSR did effectively cease to exist. To clarify the concepts, USSR was never Russia other than in informal talk. The USSR was a federation of several countries, one of which (and the one which most political weight) was Russia. In 1991 the states members of the USSR agreed to its dissolution, which brought an end to it. It was also agreed that Russia would be its successor state, replacing the SU at the international level. 

“Victorian” makes sense within the boundaries of the United Kingdom (as you say), but also within the boundaries of the British Empire. Remember that Victoria was “Empress of India”. Outside of the British Empire, for example in the USA, it does not really make sense, though lots of Americans do talk about the “Victorian era”, mainly in the context of discussions of sexual prudishness. 

If we look just at the up-market classical composers we see the following pattern: Up until the end of the 18th century virtually all of them worked either as court musicians in the service of some king or nobleman, or else they were employed by the (Catholic or Protestant) churches. Bach, for example, was a court musician in the first half of his career, and a church musician in the second half. A notable exception was Handel, who set up a profitable opera company in London. After the French revolution, when the number of petty noblemen in Europe decreased, we find composers like Beethoven, who lived from giving public concerts in big cities and by writing “Hausmusik” (music performed by amateurs in their own homes) and selling it to publishers. They also worked as music teachers for rich urban patrons. Alongside these you also have “folk” musicians traveling from place to place, playing at weddings and village feasts. 

I will let pass the lack of proof for the affirmation that Two options: PIE How did the word appear to India? Let's greet Proto-Indo-European, 

And yes, you could qualify those points as "bad leadership", but it is not as simple as "they simply did not care". 

TL/DR The initial situation of the Ottoman Empire was far from being as ideal as you describe it. While to some degrees the politics of the Porte may have been influenced by the actuation of foreign powers, adscribing all of what happened to Russian (or even all the combined foreign) influence without considering the internal situation of the Empire is too much of a stretch, unless there is solid documental evidence. 

I can get up to 1957. It is the first for the first broadcast of the Spanish Lotería de Navidad (Christmas lottery), as stated here(warning: link in Spanish) and other sources. It is worth commenting:
