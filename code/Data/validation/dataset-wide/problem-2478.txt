You asked something about "proof" which I don't understand. I think that changes to neurons aren't "proof" of memory. The proof of memory (i.e. evidence that memory exists) is for example being able to find your keys again, recognise people you know, etc. I guess there are different kinds of "evidence" for memory of past lives, used in Buddhism: 

Third, to address the logic you asked about -- IMO even an impermanent memory is sufficient to measure change. For example any thermometer is impermanent (will break eventually) but can measure change of temperature. Any human being is impermanent (will die eventually) but can observe and experience change (change in the seasons, in their surroundings, in their thoughts and feelings, and breath, and anything else you care to mention). I guess you might want to argue that some things are relatively long-lived and seem permanent -- perhaps your family, a mountain, the sky -- if so I might reply that reason or science (even if not personal memory) suggests that these things too are impermanent for various reasons; and, more importantly, our awareness or "consciousness" of them is impermanent or ever-changing. 

What if you replied, something like, "I'm sorry you feel that way"? If so then your talk with your boss would be about the boss' feelings, instead of gossip about the client. Or ask, "Is he really so bad?" That would give the boss feedback that he is speaking negatively, and an opportunity to come up with a more balanced view. Or turn the conversation to the boss' opinion about the business relationship, rather than the boss' opinion about the person. If you know the client can you contradict the boss: "Oh I don't think he's so bad. He's always polite when I talk with him. He's a good customer. He pays his bills on time." or whatever? If I read through the right speech guidelines a lot of them are about being timely (not an issue in this case sine it's the boss that decided when to bring up the subject), gentle, and not malicious. 

Nine times out of ten the action or event is inconsequential and effects us only in a minor fashion if we can find the comedy in the situation to focus on our drives will be much more relaxed. 

Now, this can be seen in the Tibetian Wheel of Life Illustration, but I do not have the memory or resources to know if any sutras flat out say it. I think it is worth noting that the drop from heaven to hell is not guaranteed by even this belief, as it is in accordance with the "individuals" karma. However in most cases after a birth in heaven, the next rebirth will tend to be in the lower realms, either animal, hungry ghost, or hell being. 

You take the cause of the karma you are working with, remember all the times you did it, realize that it is going to cause you suffering. Regret that you commited the deeds in question. The 3rd step is called "Restraint force" Here you take the cause of the karma you are working with, and you restrain yourself from doing it again. The longer you can restrain yourself the better. 

The manji (Japanese Buddhism) is said to represent love and mercy, in certain situations. This symbol should not be confused with the swastika, which is completely different. 

Accompanied by male and female bodhisattvas, bright light shines from them (White) also a dull grey light is present (hell light, associated with hell realm) The third day 

It is worth noting, in conjunction with the other answers provided, that the fetus in question is going through karma from it's past lives in a scenario like this. 

I am cutting quotes short and pulling the minimum needed for context here. To type out the entire descriptions of each stage would require much time and effort. Also, for each stage there are different ways one can react, that can cause things to happen in different orders or certain outcomes... The general feel of the stage, in the typical order that they might occur is what we are trying to illustrate here. 

People who are blind or deaf, or who are blind and deaf can learn to communicate. So I suppose this is only applicable to non-percipient beings in the formless realms: not people. Cakkhupala Thera was able to hear the dharma. 

One of the first rules of morality (ethics) is not to kill. For example here are The Patimokkha Rules which apply to Buddhist monks: 

There's a concept called 'attachment' in Western psychology: Attachment theory Although that's the same word (i.e. "attachment") in English, it's not exactly the same theory! Similarly Western psychology uses the word 'detachment' in various ways, see for example Emotional detachment. Again this (Western meaning of ) "detachment" isn't exactly the same as what Buddhist theory recommends. To avoid that automatic association between Buddhist and Western meanings, caused by using the same word ("detachment") for both, it might be better to use a slightly different word, e.g. "non-attachment" rather than "detachment". And in fact I'm not sure that Buddhists do talk about detachment or non-attachment very much. Instead perhaps they warn against the dangers of "attachment": and recommend as an antidote, not "detachment", but rather maybe "renunciation" or "equanimity". 

I think that Diksha and Pravartan both mean something like initiation or commencement. Diksha apparently means "preparation" and "initiation" (and may be used ceremonially). Pravartan is used in the Sanskrit name of the Dharmacakrapravartana SÅ«tra which is translated as "The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of the Dharma". How the words are used might vary depending on the school. I think the phrase is used in the Dalit Buddhist movement: 

There's a page on Ven. Sujato's blog, The Ten Funniest Scenes from the Pali Canon. The Buddhism.SE site guideline say I ought to quote from the reference; so here is the first, of ten: 

There is a sutta which suggests that that's a valid worry: it's the "Talaputa Sutta: To Talaputa the Actor" Getting the Message by Thanissaro Bhikkhu seems to me to soften that message, by suggesting (more specifically) that you should not inspire your audiences to greed, anger, and delusion: 

I feel like this is a good place to start. I've also heard it translated as the "in-between" the state between states if you will. In my question however I was specifically asking about From death, which the Tibetan Buddhists will always be kind enough to remind you is a certainty in life... , what directions can you "flow" through your karmic river? Not a trivial question, and for schools outside of the Mahayana, sometimes deemed a meaningless question. At which point both schools tend to stagnate in circles of missing each others points. Continuing from the commentary though I will go through the stages in order. 

Read it a long time back, I remember it had something to do with someone meditating in a field of grass, and watching the wind go through the individual blades of grass and how they swayed. It was a specific term and dealt with emptiness and the uniqueness of each passing moment. 

This is situational as well. Is it a video of something we have no control over? If so the answer is no. Is our job to stop crime, or does the video give you some knowledge that could stop the criminal etc. and you choose (Through apathy or other reasons) to ignore it, then the answer is yes. However if it is a youtube fail compilation video, or just a compilation of random crimes, that have nothing to do with you, or your community, ignoring it, would be the best option. By that I mean, not seeking more out to watch as well. 

This last branch vow is an interesting one, one skillful means described by my old guru back when I was practicing the vows and still considered myself Buddhist was the act of reprimanding with false anger. To appear angry and scold when you actual are not holding anger and are holding compassion for the one being scolded. If someone was a guru or a monk and they were telling people to kill 3rd born children (A highly unlikely case) It is permissible to break certain vows to stop them and their followers. See 

I am afraid everything is just an illusion, that there aren't others, just images and I'm alone. Also I think the fact that other "people" exist is axiomatic, a feature of Buddhist belief. Buddhism is meant to be a Middle Way between extremes. 

Kamma is defined as "action" or as "intentional action" or "a deed done deliberately", not "thought". So in no way an intention become kamma? I think that "intention" can become kamma, but maybe not "intention alone" (or maybe I didn't understand what you were asking when you wrote, "intention alone"). Intentions have consequences (e.g. if I intend to do something and then I do it -- then "doing it" is a consequence of "the intention", not to mention a proof of the intention, and the "doing" has further consequences). Also thoughts are themselves consequences (e.g. if I do something unwise and as a consequence have confused thoughts; or, do something benevolent and as a consequence have a better memory). In your OP you seemed to be hypothesizing a thought without any consequence (e.g. "intention alone without engaging in action") ... and I think that, "no, kamma is defined as action". I think that kamma in Buddhism is complicated: 

There's a book titled In the Buddha's Words which people recommend as an introductory text. Anyway that book has, amongst other things, this to say, 

There's an explanation on page 36 (page 10 of the PDF file) of Pita Tan's introduction to SN 56.11. The context is explaining the various types of dukkha ("birth is dukkha, death is dukkha, ..." and so on). 

The Pali canon was written and organized (sorted) by monks. The advice to laypeople is scattered (not organized) within the canon and therefore difficult to find. Although scattered in the canon there is there lots of advice for laypeople: about behaving ethically, choosing a good/compatible wife/husband, having a good relationship, making decisions which aren't corrupted by anger or greed, etc. This book does not mention the eight-fold path by name, nor does it make any mention of some of the elements of the eight-fold path. For example it mentions right effort, right knowledge, but does not mention concentration. There is hardly any mention of meditation in the book, except that it's practised by the Buddha and by monks. The book doesn't mention the four noble truths; although in my opinion, some applications of those truths might be present, for example the advice to laypeople includes cessation of old ways of thinking (stop clinging to the notion of "caste" for example), and living in the present with impermanence (which IMO might be examples of how to apply the third noble truth to secular life).
