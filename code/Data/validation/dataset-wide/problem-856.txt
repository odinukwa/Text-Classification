According to this website the peak visible magnitude will be about 10.5 around February 2nd. Earlier estimates had been a little brighter around the same date. 

I'll give a slightly different answer: The escape velocity at the surface of our Moon is about 2.38 km/s. Derived from this paper, as a rule of thumb, an atmosphere can survive 4.5 billion years, if it's average molecule velocity is below 1/6 of the escape velocity of the planet/moon. Applied to our Moon, it's 2380 m/s / 6 = 396.67 m/s. Carbon dioxide has a molecule mass of 44u. The according temperature for an average molecule velocity for carbon dioxide is hence $$\mbox{temperature}=(v_{\mbox{gas}}/157)^2 \cdot \mbox{molecule mass}\mbox=(396.67/157)^2\cdot 44\mbox{ K}=280.87\mbox{ K}.$$ Moon's mean surface temperature at the equator is about 220 K. That's well below the allowed 280.87 K. A carbon dioxide atmosphere could have survived 4.5 billion years according to these oversimplified assumptions. When looking closer to the atmosphere, it turns out, that the higher layers of the thermosphere and the exosphere can reach more than 1000 K. Even carbon dioxide can escape from Moon at this temperature over time: The average molecule velocity for carbon dioxide at 1000 K is $$157\cdot \sqrt{\frac{1000}{44}}\mbox{ m/s}= 748.5\mbox{ m/s}.$$ This results in a Jeans escape parameter of $$\lambda_0=\left(\frac{v_{\mbox{esc}}}{v_{\mbox{gas}}}\right)^2 =\left(\frac{2380}{748.5}\right)^2= 10.1,$$ resulting in an escape rate of about $10^{-4}$ relative to a free molecular flow. From this it isn't yet straightforward to calculate the period of time, Moon would loose a carbon dioxide atmosphere, since it's a function of the height-dependent temperature curve of the atmosphere. But it's at least clear, that Moon wouldn't loose a carbon dioxide atmosphere suddenly, since this is likely just for $\lambda_0 < 3$. 

I'm not aware of any relevant uranium ore deposit, which is related to meteoritic material. Dangerous fallout is by far the most caused by short-lived radioactive isotopes. Those isotopes are rare in meteorites as well as in rock on Earth. Natural nuclear reactors, which would produce short-lived radioactive isotopes, don't occur any more on Earth, since the natural U-235/U-238 isotope ratio is too low, now. This is due to the half-life of U-235 of about 713 million years in contrast to 4,468 million years for U-238. If an asteroid would impact into a uranium ore deposit, most of the molten ejected material would fall back to Earth as tektites. Evaporated ejecta and aerosols (dust) would probably increase health risk for some time, until it's washed out from the atmosphere. But other, less-radioactive aerosols would be a health risk, too. 

That's an image of two quasars, very close to each other, "separated on the sky by only about 70 thousand light years". According to this paper the peak density should have been about $10^{-6}$ quasars per Mpc, resulting in a peak mean distance between two quasars of about 100 Mpc. (Density of $10^{-6}$ quasars per Mpc results in one quasar per cube of $10^6 Mpc^3$, hence on average one quasar each $\sqrt[3]{10^6 \mbox{Mpc}^3}=100 \mbox{ Mpc}$) With about 1 million known quasars in the observable universe I get a mean distance of about half that distance. (With a considered light-travel distance of about $4 \mbox{ Gpc} = 4\cdot 3.26 \mbox{ Gly} = 13.04\mbox{ Gly},~~$ a little less than the 13.81 Gly light travel radius of the observable universe, the volume of a sphere with this radius is about $\frac{4}{3}\pi(4\cdot 10^3 \mbox{Mpc})^3=2.68\cdot 10^{11}\mbox{Mpc}^3$. With 1 million quasars, it's about one quasar per $268000 \mbox{ Mpc}^3$ or one quasar per $\sqrt[3]{268000 \mbox{ Mpc}^3}=64\mbox{ Mpc}$ in one dimension. Due to non-constant quasar frequency over cosmic time, the minimum mean distance should have been below this overall average distance. Using the light-travel distance considers the higher density of the earlier universe better than the comoving distance of 13.8 billion years after big bang. 4 Gpc are used as light travel radius to restrict roughly to redshift z < 7, the range where quasars have been observed. A redshift calculator can be found e.g. here, take $H_0=70.4$, $\Omega_m = 0.265$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.728$, and $z=7$.) The peak number density seems to be somewhere between a redshift of 2.0 and 2.5 (interpreting the paper). If it will turn out by future observations, that the peak number density has been earlier in the universe, we get much shorter peak mean distances. So you have at least an order of magnitude: Somewhere between 150 and 300 million lightyears (between 50 and 100 Mpc, 1 parsec equals 3.26 lightyears) should have been the peak average distance between two quasars. Might be this estimate will shrink over time, as more (distant) quasars get known. 

It has been observed 1977, and in 1994. It should be near its perihelion this year (2014) around august 7 (using wikipedia data, perihelion at March 6, 2005 and period 4.71 years), give or take a few days. 

That's mainly because of the gravity, and of size. Small objects, e.g. a stone, create only a very weak gravitation. The stone is much harder than necessary to withstand this force caused by its own gravity. Earth is much larger. The gravity at the surface causes the weight we feel. A huge mountain on Earth would be flattened under its own weight, because the matter it's made of isn't hard enough to withstand this weight. By hills filling up valleys the planet as a whole becomes spherical. A fast-rotating planet gets a slightly flattened ellipsoid shape. 

One of a million possible answers: An advanced civilization wouldn't do this without need. If necessary, they would use gravity instead of magnetism, since magnetism acts differently on different kind of matter, gravity is much better suited. They would exploit the chaotic behaviour of n-body systems like planetary systems mainly governed by gravity, and find out which distortion of minimal intervention would return the desired result. They would know the need long time in advance, hence be able to act, when there is still enough time to get the desired result with a reasonably small effort. 

The most successful methods are by gravitational microlensing and direct observation in the infrared or far infrared. The transit method doesn't work well for rogue planets, because usually at least three transits are needed to confirm a planet. 

The critical density of the universe is $$\rho_c=\frac{3H_0^2}{8\pi G},$$ with $H_0=67.8 \frac{\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}}{\mbox{Mpc}}$ the Hubble constant and $G=6.673848\cdot 10^{-11}\frac{\mbox{m}^3}{\mbox{kg }\mbox{s}^2}$ Newton's gravitational constant. Hence with one parsec $1\mbox{pc}=3.0857×10^{16} \mbox{m}$, $$\rho_c=\frac{3\cdot (67.8\cdot 10^3\cdot \frac{\mbox{m}/\mbox{s}}{3.0857×10^{22} \mbox{m}})^2}{8\pi\cdot 6.673848\cdot 10^{-11}\frac{\mbox{m}^3}{\mbox{kg}\mbox{s}^2}}=8.635 \cdot 10^{-27}\frac{\mbox{kg}}{\mbox{m}^3}.$$ Ordinary matter content is $4.9\%$, the universe has total density close to critical density, hence ordinary matter density is $$0.049\cdot 8.635 \cdot 10^{-27}\frac{\mbox{kg}}{\mbox{m}^3}=4.23 \cdot 10^{-28}\frac{\mbox{kg}}{\mbox{m}^3}.$$ (The Hubble constant is not precisely known, so the calculated density depends a bit on the precise value.) Density of water: The density of water is about $10^3 \mbox{kg}/\mbox{m}^3$. That's a factor $4.23 \cdot 10^{31}$ denser than the average universe. The space needs to have been reduced by a factor $\sqrt[3]{4.23 \cdot 10^{31}}=3.48\cdot 10^{10}$ in each if the three spatial dimensions. That's the inverse of the scale factor, hence corresponds to a redshift of $z=3.48\cdot 10^{10}$. Using the Cosmology Calculator on this website, the cosmological parameters $H_0 = 67.11$ km/s/Mpc (slightly different to the above value), $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.6825$ provided by the Planck project, and setting $\Omega_M = 1- \Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.3175$ the age of the universe was 0.022 seconds at the redshift $z=3.48\cdot 10^{10}$, hence when it was of the average density of water. Density of air at sea level: The density of air at sea level is $1.225 \frac{\mbox{kg}}{\mbox{m}^3}$. The corresponding redshift is about $z=1.423\cdot 10^9$ yielding an age of the universe of 12.68 seconds. 

It's very likely, that we don't have discovered every non man-made element. For some elements there exist only very short-lived isotopes. Plutonium... 

February 3, 2014 has been short (three days) after new moon. The moon is then about 40 degrees or about 3 hours behind the sun. Hence, what you observed is quite normal, in Europe, too. The only difference is, that the moon looks to the other side when seen from the southern hemisphere. Here, for 2014, a moon phase calendar of the northern hemisphere. 

At 99% the speed of light the behaviour would be almost completely determined by special relativity. The scenario is well-investigated for synchrotrons. In principle a synchrotron or a storage ring, e.g. around the equator of Earth, could be built. At 99% the speed of light the frequency $f_s$ of the circling object should occur red-shifted by a factor of a little more than 7 to an observer in the center of the circle due to the transverse relativistic Doppler effect: $$f_o = f_s/\gamma=f_s\cdot\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}=f_s\cdot\sqrt{1-0.99^2}=f_s\cdot\sqrt{0.0199}=0.141067 f_s.$$ For an observer immediately near the ring, the frequency $f_o$ is the same as for the observer at the center for the signal emitted, when the particle was diametral on the other side of the ring. When approaching the observer along the lign of sight, the signal of the particle is blue-shifted to $$f_o=f_s\cdot\sqrt{(1+v/c)/(1-v/c)}=f_s\cdot\sqrt{1.99/0.01}=f_s\cdot\sqrt{199}=14.1067\cdot f_s.$$ When leaving the observer along the lign of sight, the signal of the particle is red-shifted to $$f_o=f_s\cdot\sqrt{(1+v/c)/(1-v/c)}=f_s\cdot\sqrt{0.01/1.99}=0.070888\cdot f_s.$$ By this we now have calculated the observed frequencies for three positions of the circling particle/radio to give some idea about the oscillation of the observed frequency. More details about the relativistic transverse Doppler shift, see e.g. Ives-Stilwell experiment. Close to the experiment with the observer in the center of the circling particles are Mössbauer rotor experiments. In this cases ions or atomic nuclei emitting or absorbing at known wavelengths are used as "radios". This paper describes a slower version of the transverse Doppler shift, as observed by using the GPS satellites moving with just 4 km/s. In this slow case the gravitational frequency shift, as predicted by general relativity to be induced by the gravitational field of Earth, plays a relevant role, relative to the (in this case) small transverse Doppler shift. Here the GPS satellites are the moving radios.
