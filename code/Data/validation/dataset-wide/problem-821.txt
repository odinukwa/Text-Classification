Source. The core, where the fusion happens is a comparatively small region in the center. Wrapped around the core is the radiative zone and the conductive zone. which help keep the heat from fusion trapped inside the sun. As a result, over time, the inside of the sun grows hotter and as it grows hotter the core grows larger and it encompasses more and more of the radiative zone. If we think of the radiative zone as a kind of blanket that traps heat inside the sun, as the core grows larger and more massive, the radiative zone is both stretched and it loses mass to the core, so it becomes thinner in two ways. If the size of the core is doubled, the photons from the core have to travel through 1/4th as many molecules. As the sun gets old enough and most of the fusion happens on the outer edge of the core, there's significantly less of a blanket to keep the heat trapped in. It's not so much that more energy is being created, it's that that energy has an easier path to the outer region of the sun. So you have an amplification effect, as the sun grows larger, the surface gravity drops by the square of the radius and the internal heat has less material to pass through to reach the outer layers, creating an outward pressure as well as delivering more heat. The internal core collapse can play a role too. Even as the inner core runs out of hydrogen to fuse and it begins to collapse, the act of collapsing generates significant heat. Not sure that's clear, but that's my attempt to explain what happens intuitively. 

Jupiter's atmosphere, if you could see through it, the inside of the planet would begin to glow visibly red from heat perhaps a couple/few thousand miles below it's upper clouds. 

In order to redshift, something needs to be both visible and have an established frequency, like the hydrogen signature of stars. Since we've never seen another universe, and we don't even know how to look for one, or if they exist, and without knowing what they're made of. Asking if they redshift can't be answered for many reasons. There are alternative universe hypotheses out there, like the multiverse hypothesis and Neil deGrasse Tyson sometimes talks about other (theoretical) universes, but it's all very hand-wavy and there's nothing measurable and without measurement or detection, there's no direction, distance to or number of. Maybe you should start with an easier one. Point in the direction of the 4th dimension. :-) 

How much specific elements sink inside a planetary caldron with variations of heat and thermals and chemistry, depends not just on their density but also the element's chemistry. This question discusses Uranium in Earth's core and the top answer suggests (I believe correctly) there's essentially no Uranium in Earth's core, it's largely in the crust because Uranium readily oxidizes, so it forms lighter elements that don't sink but rise with the silicates and basalt, which is (roughly) similar density. Uranium floats in the Earth's mantle because it binds with Oxygen. Free Oxygen (O2) should destroy any Germane, but there's likely so little free Oxygen in Jupiter's atmosphere that the Germane is able to be present (in a fraction of parts per billion - it's very rare in Jupiter, but it's detectable). Also, given Jupiter's internal heat, thermodynamically unfavorable doesn't matter much. There's enough heat that chemistry tends to operate more in an equilibrium balance, and not always in the exothermic direction, like we usually see in most natural reactions at temperatures we see on Earth. Finally, and at risk of stating the obvious, Germane is one of those "weird" heavy gases, due to the atomic electrical symmetry, and because it's a gas, not a solid and given Jupiter's significant thermal currents, it mixes in Jupiter's atmosphere. It likely freezes out of Jupiter's upper atmosphere when it gets too cold, but it's present in the lower atmosphere, present enough to be detected anyway. (I think it's less than 1 ppb). - That's a brief answer anyway. I've not read any of the recent articles on this. They're all pay articles. I invite anyone who has read them to give a more detailed answer. Edit 

There's a boatload we don't know about the evolution of life on other planets but seems perhaps universally true that life adapts, so I find it difficult to believe that moderate seasons are necessary. Very extreme changes could be difficult, but change can force adaptation. 

How old are Janus and Epimetheus, and are they believed to have formed out of a collision? (I think would explain their shared orbit). Not the age of their elements, which should be similar to the age of the solar system, but the age of their surface and formation. Cassini told us that Saturn's rings formed relatively recently, 100 or 200 million years ago. Are there similar aging techniques that can be applied to the surface of icy moons and as that been done? (related, this type of aging technique should apply to Pluto and Charon too, because they are believed to have formed by collision). Edit: I came across this which says: 

Surface temperature isn't well defined on gas giant planets because we can't see the surface. Also (I think all 4, I know for sure Jupiter and Neptune), they give off more heat internally than they receive from the sun. Temperature on the visible surfaces / upper atmospheres of the gas giants has more to do with circulation than anything else. Mars There's a number of articles on Mars warming, but there's still a lot we don't know about Mars' climate. It's not too difficult using modern technology and with Mars' thin atmosphere, to read surface temperature on Mars by measuring the infra red light that comes from it's surface. The surface temperature on Mars was first measured in 1920 (see 4th paragraph from the top), and NASA says here that they've been taking accurate surface temperature readings on Mars for 30 years (article from May 2007), so it's pretty safe to say we have about 38-39 Earth years (20 or so Mars years) of reasonably good global temperature readings on Mars and a few decades more than that with less accuracy. There's many problems with reaching any kind of conclusion on Mars based on that data though. Mars has significantly greater eccentricity than Earth, so it may be prone to larger temperature swings than Earth and just 20 Mars years of data is too few. Winter to Summer on Mars' enough CO2 can freeze to reduce it's atmosphere by as much as 25% and that can drive temperature changes and mars is also prone to planet wide dust storms that can last months. These can have the effect of blocking sunlight and after settling, darkening the ice caps, which lowers albedo. Like Pluto, Mars' atmosphere, climate, temperature and orbit are dynamic and there's still a lot we don't know about how they worth together to form a predictable climate on Mars. As an FYI, dust storms are nothing like in the movie the Martian, but they can cause a visible haze over the planet that can obscure viewing it's surface. A nice short article on Mars' dust storms here and here. I think it's kind of cool that Mars forms an annual "cloud", not unlike how parts of Earth form annual snow and ice covers in winter that thaw in Summer, but we don't know nearly enough about Mars, even with 20 Mars years of observation, to make good long term predictions on Mars' climate. Venus Venus, as far as I know, pretty much never changes. It's the same temperature, Winter, Summer, Pole, Equator. There might be some slight variation of Venus temperature depending on elevation, like the gas giants, but I'm not sure. Venus traps heat so effectively that is changes very little, in fact, I've never seen one article mentioning Venus' surface temperature changing as much as 1 degree. Venus reflects most of the sunlight that hits it away anyway, so it would be less prone to solar variation anyway. I won't do Mercury cause I don't know enough about it, but that's 7 out of 8 anyway. . . . If your question is about having a good understanding of climates on other planets, then decades of surface temperature data wouldn't be enough even if we did have it. Centuries of accurate surface temperature data, you could begin to recognize patterns, for the inner 4 planets anyway, but decades isn't enough to differentiate between a baseline, a natural fluctuation or a transition period. If anyone tells you there are no SUV's on mars, so how could Mars be warming, get away from them as fast as you can. They're not interested in science. 

OK, so, which is it, solar activity or albedo modulation, cause they're not the same thing. The first takes place on the sun, the 2nd, the earth. This paragraph makes no sense to me. 

It's a pretty clever idea and a solid question that unseen mass might cause gravity outside the observable that tugs on the universe and might be the cause of dark energy as opposed to some unknown energy that seems to permeate all space. It's not a new idea, but it's worth answering. There's 2, possibly 3 (or 4) pretty big problems to that approach. The first is that Dark Energy expansion is very uniform. For it to be explained by gravity, that gravity would need to be close to uniform around the observable universe, with Earth close to the center. A giant "edge" as you called it, or maybe we're in a low mass bubble surrounded by higher mass. Not impossible, but somewhat improbable that the Earth is in the center of this theoretical gravity field pulling the observable universe apart. The 2nd problem is time. Gravity travels at the speed of light, so this gravity field would need to have existed prior to the big bang or be very close to the edge of the observable universe. Still not impossible, but it's a difficult theory to work with as it requires a few leaps of faith. A possible 3rd problem is that measurements show that the universe is very flat. I don't know if a gravity field of the sort you suggest would be flat or not, I suspect not, unless it was enormously large. Given enough time, maybe they can find a test to detect gravitons (if they exist) or, find dark energy and answer this one with better certainty. The question is asked here on Quora if interested. I'll add a 4th problem. The velocity of observed young galaxies at the edge of the observable universe is close to the speed of light away from us in all directions. Relative velocity that high is difficult to explain by high mass outside of the observable universe cause that mass would need to be enormous, measurably greater than the mass of the observable universe. All the factors taken into account, it's an improbable explanation If I've missed anything obvious or broken any laws of physics with the answer above, corrections are always welcome.
