in my opinion nobody can help animals with regard to their kamma, they're simply to exhaust the kamma which caused their birth as an animal and bounce to the plane their remaining kamma allows them to i'm not sure why pets would differ in this respect from wild animals dhammic concept of kamma is ethical, only ethical intentions produce it, and since animals are incapable of having and committing ethically meaningful intentions and acts, because they don't control their urges and instincts, cannot judge them objectively and restrain or motivate themselves, they don't produce new kamma the concept is not dissimilar to exoneration from liability on the grounds of incompetency that's again my opinion 

to the best of my familiarity with the Canon, outside of clear instructions for laity regarding 3 ways of skillful bodily action 

leaving it to our own discretion and judgement to decide what should and should not be done, necessary and unnecessary, useful and useless for our own good going back to the Cunda sutta (AN 10.176) 

Samannaphala sutta (DN 2) then again there have been householders who attained noble levels, so it's all not totally foregone 

Paticcasamuppadavibhanga sutta ( SN 12.2) i think ignorance covers nescience of the phenomenon of suffering and the way of escape from it 

In response to the comment of Ilya Grushevskiy Rebirth has everything to do with the Buddhist soteriology because if it weren't for rebirth suffering could have been easily ended at natural death or at any moment "in the here and now" with suicide, and the entire teaching if the Buddha would be pointless and vain. But it is because of rebirth that beings need a method of salvaging themselves from suffering, propagation of which was the purpose of the Buddha's ministry. It is exactly because of rebirth that liberation must be attained here and now, otherwise next birth follows. The stock phrases are not to be dismissed, it's agreed that they actually constitute the core of the Dhamma. Besides these stock phrases there're many suttas which deal with destinations for next existence based on the behavior in the current life. Secular Buddhism is a cherry picking Buddhism, its proponents only select what conveniently fits in with their preconceptions rooted in Western rationalism, discarding the rest as 'superstitious'. They don't seem concerned with samsara and ultimate predicament of existence, they're happy enough to alleviate some suffering in this life using the Dhamma as a psychotechnic. But this is not exactly the gist of the Buddha's teaching. 

If my understanding is correct,"mind states correlate with realms of rebirth".I don't think you can practice Vipassanna in any Jhanic State.Not even the first jhana (rupajhana). So i don't think any one reborn in a corresponding jhanic realm can practice vipassanna as they are in Absorbtion.I think those born in a non-jhanic realm such a tusita realms etc can hear the dharma.But not those in the rupa or arupa jhanas. Except for the Five Pure Abodes i think their an exception.Though forgive me if i am mistaken. 

Like Sankha said "it depends on what kind of meditation your doing"? If your doing insight meditation you can meditate on the physical sensation of hunger. However,if your doing concentration practice it is not useful to use the physical sensation of hunger. Why? Because physical sensations keep changing.In concentration practice you need a relatively fixed object to concentrate on.This will ensure greater stability in concentration. So this depends on what kind of meditation you'd like to practice. 

I think to call yourself a Buddhist or practice the buddhist teaching you should at least believe in cause and effect.Maybe not in past lives but in the here and now.When you can see cause and effect clearly in the present then you'll infer that the same principle applies after death. Things you do in this life will have some effect after.(Future rebirth) There must be something you did before that caused you to be here now in this life.(Past Birth) Note: Rebirth is not the same as reincarnation.Please search this site for more info. 

Many people believe that their good or bad thoughts can materialize in the future. Yes.In the Dhammapada it says The Mind is the forerunner of all things. Everything begins in the mind.From the most subtlest intentions to thoughts. So some people try to be always in good mood and think positively. When you think good thoughts,you tend to feel good,you tend to do good,and you create good,and enjoy the fruits of your goodness.But this does not happen linearly.So you may think positive but still struggle with depression due to the bad thoughts you have ruminated about in the past.Only because you don't see the results right away doesn't mean nothing's happening. Also it's very important to define good thoughts.Good thoughts refers to thoughts that are skillful or wholesome.Not just thoughts that feels good.As it is possible to have positive thinking and be delusional at the same time.And it is possible to think of unwholesome things that feel good but brings suffering. Others are not so happy and just try not to think about bad things too often to prevent them from happening. To think that by "not thinking about it" they can prevent bad things from happening is slightly delusional.Depends on one's karma.If the fruit of a bad karma ripens due to to the right conditions then ... no amount of "not thinking about it" will stop it.Neither in the sky nor in mid-ocean, nor by entering into mountain clefts, nowhere in the world is there a place where one may escape from the results of evil deeds.-Dhammapada And finally there are large groups of people that pray to some god. It all depends on the individual themselves.Whether they pray to a God or not the key that makes these thoughts materialize is their intentions,their karma,their actions. Can thoughts of all these people materialize into a real events, creatures, things? At least sometimes? Yes thoughts can materialize because of cause and effect.But they are governed by certain laws.Law of gravity,law of karma,law of nature etc and also our own actions and in actions.We can wish for a good meal,but if we don't get up and make it and no one comes by and makes it for us then we're not going to have one. 

Yes. Not seeing things as they really are. Identifying with things as being I or mine. When covetousness leads to hatred, it means that you were not being mindful, and therefore did not apply the correct antidote, which is letting go. As soon as greed or aversion arises in the mind, it must be seen/observed with proper insight and let go of. Also, as Chris mentioned you can also apply mudita, after having observed the arising and ceasing of envy. 

Constantly remind yourself of the natural characteristics of this world. That all conditioned things are subject to change, they're ephemeral, they cannot be controlled. Therefore are unable to bring satisfaction. Remind yourself of why that is. What is the cause of this dissatisfaction? Clinging & craving, the desire to become/have or the desire for oneself/things to become extinct. Observe the grasping, observe the clinging and the results of such. You will come to realize that this very clinging is burdensome, it is oppressive. Gradually you will become disenchanted with clinging, you will become dispassionate. You will learn to let go. Clinging is like putting ones hands into the fire. With time you learn to abstain from clinging, not intellectually but through insight/wisdom. Observe your breath whenever you can, even if just for one minute at a time. Recollect the mind into focus and learn to rest with things as they are. You should also learn the correct way to practice ''anapanasati'' If you're interested in reading materials, regarding ''anapanasati'' and ''letting go''. I highly recommend these books. 

There is always a cause. Moods are often caused by something physical. Unrestful sleep, toxins circulating in the brain, lack of certain hormones/nutrients etc. You can eat healthy, exercise, meditate, but ultimately these moods will come and go. You succumb to unwholesome behaviours, because of the force of habitual tendencies, reacting a certain way towards these moods. Since there is no ''controller, persona, immutable self'' we cannot simply make them go away at will. In this case ''a bad mood'' will lead to ''grief'' if not observed objectively. Patiently enduring the mood, not trying to push it away, not reacting towards it. To rest with things as they are, regardless of conditions. ''Ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.'' As confidence in the practice grows, so will ardency. 

If your really afraid of black magic in Thailand remember,if you don't bear any ill will it "bounces" back to the owner.In other words if your a good person or virtuous someone's ill will can not harm you.Not even a powerful nature spirit can harm you if your heart is pure.A virtuous person is respected by other beings.Take refuge in your virtue.Your sila gives you the confidence to stand up and face hostility because your blameless.Your whole.I advice that you recite the Paritta Protection Book.And do a lot of metta practice.If someone is going through great lengths to spread and concentrate I'll will on you.You should be doing the opposite.For hatred can only be overcome by love. 

There are many kinds of samadhi.Jhana is Right Samadhi.The one taught by Siddharta's teachers were not what The Buddha called Right Samadhi. Right Samadhi which is Jhana can only be achieved if one has Right View.Different kind of samadhi can produce rapture bliss calm.But are not Jhana without Right View.Samatha meditation shouldn't be discouraged as it is a part of the Eight Noble Path.Siddharta remembered The First Jhana when he was meditating under extreme conditions.So he could not have been practicing Right Samadhi Jhana at that point.But he was definitely practicing deep samadhi as an astetic. 

1.Are the wealthy experiencing dukkha in a different way to the poor? We all experience dukkha differently depending on our karma.The wealthy can afford to experience happiness born out of sensual pleasures than the poor. 2.If so, in what way? Are they experiencing it in a more / less refined way? How refined their dukkha is depends on how strong they attach to the happiness their wealth brings to them.The more they attach to it the more painful their dukkha is the less they attach the more subtle it will be. 3.What did the "Buddha" say about money and suffering? Money or wealth does not bring suffering.It is our strong craving/attachment to it that brings suffering.Wealth is actually in a way kind of like a blessing.It is one of the karmic resultant of practicing generosity in previous lives and the result of being hard working and industrious.The Buddha often instructed lay people on how to preserve their wealth.And in the Adiya Sutta even describes the benefits to be obtained by having wealth.Adiya Sutta:Benefits to be Obtained from Wealth So don't see money or wealth as a cause of suffering.you can easily substitute the word money for anything under the sun and the only way it will cause us suffering is through our strong attachment to it. 

according to the commentary on Vinaya the Theravadin orthodox view on slavery is of acceptance as a fact of life assistance a slave in escape from the master without mitigating factors is regarded as theft, a grave, parajika, offense, which invariably results in the offender's expulsion with no right to re-join the Sangha in the remaining lifetime ("The Buddhist Monastic Code, Pt 1" by Ven Thanissaro Bhikkhu, p.70) 

i think it depends on the attitude and the frame of mind a care to keep in mind the fact that it's a business of maintaining fitness of a frail and mortal bag of bones and impurities may negate the tendency of the attachment to body and self-association with it to become stronger, which such type of activity in my opinion is prone to foster but if one IS a Buddhist they must be able to skilfully counteract that tendency in any case the motive for going to gym for a Buddhist should not be improvement of bodily appearance but rather health considerations in the frame of mind along the lines of the attitude to eating recommended for monks in the suttas 

i entertain three possible explanations of equanimity as brahmavihara: a) impartiality, i.e. directing the other three equally at everyone irrespective of their qualities - mine b) lack of involvement with and attachment to others - Laurence Khantipalo c) watching carefully and ready to act (in helping others) - suggested by some other person 

because with a worldling justice is being served from a defiled mind, the intentions can't ever be completely pure and so justice will eventually not be just i think the most Buddhist advice would be to refrain from rendering justice as much as possible, the law of kamma will in due course take care of that anyway 

I presume that your object is the breath, crossing the anapana spot (under the nostrils, on the upper lip). You must be careful since wanting the Nimitta to appear will actually prevent it from appearing. As long as you desire such things, to experience Nimitta or Jhana, it will simply never happen. Let go of such expectations, completely. Also, by wanting Nimitta to appear, there is a very high chance of it being the product of your imagination. You must let it be, do not give it any attention. Nimitta will strengthen, stabilize, and merge with the object on its own. Always remain with the object. 

Continuous mindfulness is the key. You must learn to let go of that hatred. You must renounce hatred, anger, once and for all. Whenever such a thought arise ''I don't like people, I hate people'', you must be aware and know it as it is. Observe the related thoughts and feelings in an objective manner, without reacting, by simply turning, holding and sustaining your attention to what has just appeared, just at time of its duration. You must ''decondition'' the habit pattern you have created. Later on, metta will arise naturally. Or at the very least it will be quite easy to cultivate. 

Pa-Auk Forest Monastery, in Myanmar (Burma). $URL$ However, you will have to develop access concentration before you can begin Vipassana (Satipatthana). You may remain there for a period of months or years, even lifetime if you are able to renew your visa each year. You also have the chance to ordain after a few weeks or months, once deemed trustworthy. At first you will be able to get a visa of 3 months and extend the visa for a 1 year period each time. Yearly visa is about 100$ US. May you realize Nibbana and know true peace and freedom, friend. 

What is the difference between the progress of "low intensive" meditators as opposed to "high intensive" meditators? Progress is much slower for low intensive meditators.(not taking into consideration one's karma). From personal experience the amount of time i sat meditating continuously directly correlates with meditation progress.In other words high intensive meditation resulted in meditation progress for me. X hours of meditation= X Progress.Give or take. but i cannot speak about others.As this is what i have observed,tried and tested and is true in my own life.This is my karma.No matter what i do i never seem to get more or less then what i put in.This is unfortunate because progress depends on how much effort i am willing to put in which at times can be a challenge.Some people don't have to do much.They just sit and they enter the Jhanas or gain insight but my karma is different.And so is yours. Always remember cause and effect. So if you cause (Meditation) there will be an effect (Progress/Insight/Jhana).When,how much,how long,you'll have to observe,try and test it in your own life. 

How are people supposed to practice sitting meditation when there are so many distractions around like working, internet social media pages and other things like that? 1.You can try to make the time to do sitting meditation.Even if it's just for 5 minutes.Put it down in your organizer or calender. Hopefully this will give you the motivation to do it. 2.Practice working meditation,social media meditation,and other things like that meditation.What i mean is practice being aware of what you are doing.If you are working be aware of working.If your on social media be aware of being on social media.Whatever you do just be aware of it.Nothing is beyond awareness.You can be aware of anything from the greatest happiness to the most torturing pain. Basically what you need is Right Effort.
