In case it helps with your parser: I think this construction tends to be avoided when the first NP is not pronominal. 

This is, incidentally, also the way many learners of German with Polish as first language pronounce these vowels. These rounded vowels do not exist in Polish. The Slavic influence on some German dialects might have occurred as early as the 10th c. as this is the time German eastward expansion into (not only) Slavic territory started. The relevant Wikipedia article states that old and new population frequently mixed, so there were many opportunities for contact between people. The following Wikipedia map shows the time frame for different regions: 

After the Norman Conquest in 1066 French quickly replaced English in all domains associated with power. French was used at the royal court, by the clergy, the aristocracy, in law courts. But the vast majority of the population continued to speak English. Had the aristocracy and clergy miraculously vanished in 1100 English would have taken over right away. In reality it took until the 14th c. for English to slowly supplant French in many of these domains. There are several reasons for this: 

Well Papua New Guinea famously has a lot of languages - 830 languages at the last count (and that's languages, not dialects!) However, I'm not sure about how different these languages are, but the numbers are huge and do come from a few different backgrounds. For example, English and Hiri Motu are pretty different languages. If you take the land mass of PNG (452,860 km sq) and divide by the number of languages, according to ethnologue (830) you get a figure of approximately 546 km squared per language. The figure for Vanuatu would be approx. 107 km sp per language, indicating a higher density, but whether or not these languages vary as much as those of PNG, you'd have to consult the link given in jlovegren's answer. 

I'll limit a few examples to the varieties of English found in the UK here. Northumbria There's a phenomenon known as the Northumbrian Burr in Northumbria in the North of England wereby (older) spreakers "typically pronounced as a voiced uvular fricative, often with accompanying lip-rounding ([ʁ(ʷ)])". The Survey of English Dialects 1950-61 even states that this is not only found in the syllable onset, but also maintained in the coda position (with any occurrence of /r/ being rare in British Englishes, other than Scottish varieties, South East, South West and part of Lancashire - e.g. Blackburn, Burnley). South Wales In my part of South Wales, itis not uncommon to hear older (and indeed younger), rural speakers pronounce /r/ as an uvular trill in both Welsh and English. I believe this is more common in the varieties of English spoken by bilingual (Welsh and English) speakers. As a small note, it should be worth mentioning that this is not something common in Welsh and that it would not be thought of as "standard". I know of older males who have this feature, but also younger speakers (my mother being of them) and even people I went to school with, now in their 20s. These are just two examples within the UK that I know of, but there are plenty of other nuances. 

Intonation languages do not make such distinctions. Intonation is only used to distinguish the meaning of sentences. English 

the number of native speakers of English is far outstripped by the number of speakers of English as a second or foreign language (ESL/EFL) most ESL/EFL speakers interact more with other ESL/EFL speakers than with native speakers, and many ESL speakers hardly ever interact with native speakers of English 

The king helped the people is a statement about what the king did and might be part of a larger section telling his story: he was intelligent, had to spend his childhood in another country, and after his return, the king helped the people. But The people were helped by the king is a statement about the people: During the great famine everybody was hungry and desperate. In kingdom A many died, but in kingdom B the people were helped by the king. Since themes are usually known to those involved in the conversation (discourse-given), they tend to be definite. Usually the subject of a sentence is also its theme because prototypical themes/subjects are high on the animacy hierarchy - such as humans. On top of the animacy hierarchy are those involved in a conversation, who can be referred to with I, we, you, and these are always discoure-given. So it makes sense that subjects, which are often rhemes, usually come at the beginning of a sentence. (2) What mechanisms of changing word order are used in isolating languages? Syntactic means such as those referred to by jlawler are available in English and some other languages, such as French. Here's an example of a cleft sentence: 

So in non-rhotic varieties, these forms become Del, Sal/Sally, Harry/Hal/Hap to avoid the coda-position /r/. So is the change from /r/ in the cases of Robert and Richard, where /r/ is in a syllable onset, the subject of some phonological change or something different (e.g. Etymology). 

English Grammar and Syntax defines the two as follows: Grammar is a set of rules that set forth the correct standard of usage in a language. These rules dictate how we should say things correctly. For example, agreement between words in relation to other constructions in the sentence. Syntax is the study of sentences and their structure, and the constructions within sentences. Syntax tells us what goes where in a sentence. 

Is there a phonological reason for this change? I know there are names where, when clipped, there is /r/ in coda position. For example: 

Many nouns in Welsh have a the plural form that is shorter than the singular form (i.e. the singular form looks like the plural form + affix). For example: Singular 

Wikipedia suggests that Japanese is such a language. For example the pronoun watashi "I" becomes watashi-tachi "we" 

How large your corpus should be depends on what exactly you want to use it for, and what alternatives are available. If you want to know the 2,000 most frequent words of a language, a 1 M. word corpus will be sufficient to conclude that these words should be taught earlier than the words with frequency ranks 10,000 to 12,000. Of course, if a much larger corpus is available (say, 10 M. words), you will want to use this one. But in 1967, the Brown Corpus of American English, the first modern computer-based corpus, just became available, with a size of 1 M. words. Nowadays, much larger corpora are available for many languages and dialects. But for a smaller language, if a 1 M. word corpus is available, it will allow you to answer many questions (regarding frequent lexis etc.) that you couldn't hope to answer without a corpus of this size. 

However, German Futur II does not express an action taking place after the action expressed by Futur I. Instead, Futur II expresses an action taking place in the future, but before another action expressed by Futur I. In this respect it is similar to the pluperfect, which expresses an action that took place before another action expressed by the perfect/past tense. But the relation between Futur II and Futur I is not a mirror-image of the relation between pluperfect and perfect. Also note that Futur I is the unmarked tense here. Used on its own, it just refers to an action taking place in the future. 

Where can I find a copy of Paul Kiparsky's How abstract is phonology? written in 1968? The only place version I've found so far is a snippet view on Google Books and this summary. 

In certain papers on Optimality Theory (e.g. this paper by McCarthy, or this) the tableaus contain the notations *L and *W, as seen in the image below: 

My knowledge of tonal language is very limited, so I'm not clear on what the case is and unsure about examples, but my question is this: In tonal languages, like Mandarin, is tone carried and therefore transcribed on the phoneme /w/? i.e. in a word such as /fwl/ in a tonal language, would we ever transcribe the tone on the /w/ phoneme (/w/ being a semivowel, rather than a true vowel)? 

Hesternal Past tense describes an event occurred yesterday (in an absolute tense system) or the day preceding the day under consideration (in a relative system) and the crastinal future describes and event which will occur tomorrow (in an absolute system) or the following the day under consideration (in a relative system). Does a language have to express these particular types of tense by the form of an affix? Could you say that English has a hesternal past form in sentences like "I went to town yesterday", where yesterday limits the event to the day preceding today. 

German has for more than 1000 years been in contact with West Slavic languages, notably Polish and Czech. This is highly likely to have led to borrowing or interference between these languages, in both directions. It seems that discussion of this is usually restricted to influence from German on Polish and Czech. For example, the Polish dialect spoken in the Poznań region is reported to be heavily influenced by German. There is also a great number of German loanwords in Polish, such as malować from G. malen (both to paint). I'm interested in influence in the opposite direction, from Polish and/or Czech to German (standard or other dialects), particularly on pronunciation. There is a Euromosaic study alluding to some influence of Polish on Silesian and East Prussian dialects, but it doesn't give any details or sources. Possible influence The rounded vowels /y/ and /ø/ are realised as /i/ and /e/ in the Saxon dialect and used to be pronounced this way in Silesian and East Prussian dialects of German: 

Den Mann is accusative, so although it's in first position in the second sentence, it's still clear that the man/den Mann is the object in both sentences. Word order is free in German in the sense that these two sentences describe the same action. However, OVS word order is marked and might be used to stress the identity of the object, somewhat like It was the man that was bitten by the dog, not the woman. In German you can move constituents around because they are marked by case. In English you can't, but there are other strategies to do that: It was the man that was bitten by the dog shows two: Passive and it-cleft. (Other aspects like verb-second word order and the Vorfeld - Mittelfeld - Nachfeld distinction only show that German word order is not completely free - But still it is much more flexible than English word order.) However, German also has these syntactic options. As a native speaker of German and with some experience in teaching English to advanced learners of English, I don't really see how English discourse structure should be terribly hard to learn for native speakers of German. There are some idiosyncrasies, in the sense that one particular structure is more appropriate in a certain context in English, but another one in German. But you get that with any pair of two languages. What I do think is challenging, particularly for advanced learners of English, are choices in English syntax where there is no hard and fast rule. For example whether to use simple past or present perfect to express an action in the past, or whether to use the of-genitive or the s-genitive/possessive. Your friends might find English discourse structure challenging for their particular reasons - After all learners are individuals and everybody has their own way of learning a foreign language. Also, I think what you perceive as difficult in a foreign language and what actually is difficult for you can be two very different things (that's my personal experience from teaching - So I don't have any actual data to back this up). 

Fillers are used in many languages when the speaker signals that he or she is thinking but has not yet finished talking. Things in English like umm, er, uh etc. Is there something that can be put in the interlinear gloss to convey this? Something like FILL, or a similar abbreviation? 

What is meant by these notations? The second paper I linked to used these examples if you want to see the kinds of contexts they're used in. 

The verb in a language like English can inflect for person, for example: I see the cat > he sees the cat and the verb can inflect for tense: I see the cat > I saw the cat But do any languages inflect for the singular/plural aspect of the object? i.e. is there a language where the verb 'to see' would be different in the two contexts 'I see the cat' and `I see the cats' 

This way of forming the plural is common in Welsh nouns. It may be that this way of forming the plural is fairly common in other languages. Even if this form of pluralisation isn't all that rare, I'd still like to know what this kind of pluralisation is called? 

The Brown corpus, which is a representative 1 M. word sample of 1960s American English, has been used extensively in research on short-term diachronic change. A number of corpora have, over the last one or two decades, been compiled that extend the Brown corpus. There is a 1990s American English corpus (Frown), and a 1960s and a 1990s British English corpus (LOB and F-LOB). Together, these have been called the Brown family of corpora. Research based on these corpora includes: 

Hyperonymy and other sense relations are not usually applied to adjective + noun combinations (expections are made where the combination is lexicalised, such as White House). Instead, your examples can be analysed by comparing the sets of entities they refer to. The phrase with a modifier can refer only to a subset of the entities that the noun without modifier can refer to. Some cities are big, and not all cities are big. a city can then refer to any city from the set of all existing cities, while a big city can only refer to a subset of all cities - namely those of a certain size. 

You probably want to check out the book Armenian loanwords in Turkish by Robert Dankoff. He lists azap 'torment', deri 'leather' and zekrek etc. as examples of Armenian words in Turkish. 

Well it's hard to tell when a language is 'born' because it often develops from another older language. I guess you could find a "date of birth" for a constructed language maybe. As for language death, well it could be when the last living speaker dies, taking the language with them. Another theory would be that a language dies when it's second last speaker does, because the last remaining speaker can not use that language with anyone, I.e. it is not a means of communication any more. If you wan to know more about language death then you should consult Crystal (2002) Language Death. 

So how is it so that these loanwords attain the tone pattern that they do? Is there some kind of pattern? 

This Basque etymological dictionary claims that the word is "of unknown origin", but that the variant forms (h)uri and iri have been recorded in toponymy of Rioja, Alava and Navarro (Basque-speaking regions) from the 11th Century onwards. This would suggest that they are of Basque origin (and would rule out your theory of incorporation through the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia - as the forms were recorded in the region prior to the existence of the kingdom)
