Potentially, one way to proceed is to multiply out the product and use the symmetry about $1/2$ to obtain $$S(X)=-\frac{1}{2}+\sum_{q\leq X}\sum_{(a,q)=1}\left(\frac{aa^{*}}{q^2}-\frac{1}{4}\right).$$ Using the fact that $aa^{*}-k(a)q=1$, where $k(a)$ is the greatest number of integer multiples of $q$ less than $aa^{*}$, and $k(a)/q$ is another non-trivial Farey fraction, one obtains $$S(X)=-\frac{1}{2}+\sum_{q\leq X}\sum_{(a,q)=1}\left(\frac{k(a)}{q}-\frac{1}{4}\right) +O(\log X).$$ However, the mapping $a\rightarrow k(a)$ is not an automorphism of the multiplicative group of integers modulo $q$, and the behaviour of $k$ seems to be quite complex. 

Do these bounds together imply that those $s$ with property $P$ belong to subset that is asymptotically smaller than $S$ itself? What geometric tools are used to conclude this is the case if so? 

I am interested in those $s\in S$ which also have a particular property $P$ say, and it turns out that for this subset one also has: 

Specifically, if $\rho$ is such that $\zeta(\rho)=0$ and $\max_{\rho}\Re(\rho)= \Theta$, can anything interesting be said about the number/distribution of zeros on the vertical line $\sigma=\Theta$? Clearly this question is almost as hypothetical as they get, so I welcome conditional answers (though not on RH please), consequences of the Bohr-Landau theorem, consequences of the known behavior of $\zeta(s)$ in the critical strip, etc. Maybe you know something along the lines of ``If there are finitely/ infinitely many, then...''? I am also interested in why your answer may simply be ``No.'' 

Let $p$ be an odd prime (large if it matters) and let $G= Aff(\mathbb{F}_{p^2}) \cong \mathbb{F}_{p^2} \rtimes \mathbb{F}_{p^2}^*$ be the affine linear group acting on $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ by $x\mapsto ax+b$, $a\in \mathbb{F}_{p^2}^*$ and $b\in\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. Consider the $\mathbb{F}_2$-representation $V=\{f\colon\mathbb{F}_{p^2}\to \mathbb{F}_2\}$ of $G$ with the action $f(x)\mapsto f(ax+b)$. There are 4 invariant subspaces that I can easily find, namely the two trivial ones, the constant functions, and the space of $f$ with $\sum_{x} f(x)=0$. Are there any more invariant subspaces? 

We can show that (1) the abelianizations of $H$ and $K$ are isomorphic (2) $H/M_S(H)\cong K/M_S(K)$, where $S$ is a non-abelian finite simple group and for a group $G$, $M_S(G)$ is the intersection of all normal subgroups $U$ with $G/U\cong S$; so $G/M_S(G)$ is the maximal quotient of the form $S\times \cdots \times S$. 

If $G$ is a cyclic transitive group, then $p=\varphi(n)/n$. If $G=S_n$, then $p=1/n$. (If $G$ is not transitive, then $p=0$) 

Do there exist values of $x$ for which $$M_1(x)=M_2(x)=\cdots=M_{\log_2x-2}(x)=0?$$ What hypotheses preclude the simultaneous vanishing of $M_k(x)$, $1\leq k\leq \log_2 x-2$? Is it possible that $M_k(x)$, $1\leq k\leq \log_2 x-2$, can be simultaneously small? 

Some time ago I read part of a book in which the author made some conjectures outlining what kind of zero distribution is expected for functions representable by Dirichlet series with completely multiplicative coefficients in some half plane, based on statements about non-zero value distributions. Unfortunately I forgot the author's name, and have not found the book since. The connection outlined was something along the lines of: 

I think it is probably well known that, for every $1/2<\sigma\leq 1$, the function $1/\zeta(\sigma+it)$ is unbounded. Yet, I cannot decide how deep this is. I imagine it could be proved using a universality argument, or by extending the $\sigma=1$ case by a convexity argument on the $\mu$-function, or perhaps directly by Kronecker's theorem, or maybe even Euler-MacLaurin, but I don't yet know. Therefore I would like to know about proofs and, importantly, anything you would like to say about how "deep" this is. For example, can you explain that it follows from something quite trivial, or perhaps that it is relatively as weak/strong as something else? 

If C is a family of finite groups that is closed to taking quotients, normal subgroups, and extensions, then the free group on two generators embeds into the pro-C completion. Such C's can be the finite p-groups or the finite solvable groups, and others. See, e.g., Fried-Jarden's Field Arithmetic, Prop. 17.5.11, for a proof. 

Let me start by rigorously pose my question. Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $2$, let $n$ be an even integer number, let $f(X) = X^n + T_1 X^{n-1} + \cdots + T_n$, be the generic polynomial, that is, $T = (T_1, \ldots, T_n)$ is a tuple of algebraically independent variables over $K$. Let $\Omega = $ { $\omega_1, \ldots, \omega_m$} be a finite subset of $K$, let $f_i(X) = f(X) - \omega_i$, and let $F_i$ be the splitting field of $f_i$ over $K(T)$ ($i=1,\ldots, m$). Question: For which $\Omega$ the splitting fields $F_1, \ldots, F_m$ are linearly disjoint over $K(T)$? Remarks: 

This isn't a research level mathematics question, but you do have to do a bit of high school calculus. Since $y\log(2/y)$ is strictly increasing and $k(a-y)\log(2/(a-y))$ is strictly decreasing on $(0,a)$, dividing the l.h.s by the r.h.s, differentiating twice and setting the result to $0$ should give you the unique point where the curves meet. EDIT: This is incorrect (or at least it only holds for $k=1$, which trivially gives you the mid-point) because the inflection point is unchanged by the constant $k$. Apologies. Speaking of arcane special functions! the $q$-digamma function function might be of some use: $$\frac{d}{dz} \log\Gamma_q(z)=-\log(1-q)+\log(q)\sum_{0}^{\infty}\frac{q^{n+z}}{1-q^{n+z}}.$$ 

Firstly I am wondering what, exactly, are you trying to count? The Dirichlet coefficients have been given explicitly by GH, so am I to assume this is where you started and now you are looking for another way to estimate the partial sums? Secondly, you cannot integrate the Laurent series termwise so that isn't going to help. My answer to your question merely explains why ``explicit formulae'' are not going to help you in the case $n=1$, which naturally impacts on the higher order cases, and offers an approach to simplifying your problem another way. Formally speaking, your function $I(x)$ has the same relationship to $\lfloor x \rfloor-1$ as Riemann's prime counting function $J(x)$ has to the ordinary prime counting function $\pi (x)$ - they are related by a particular type of Mobius transform, which amounts to taking logarithms of the infinite products comprised of the terms from the original Dirichlet series. You have $$I(x)=\sum_{n\leq \log_2x}\frac{\lfloor x^{1/n} \rfloor-1}{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\sigma-i\infty}^{\sigma+i\infty}\log\prod_{n\geq 2}\left(1-\frac{1}{n^s}\right)^{-1}\frac{x^sds}{s}$$ and Riemann had $$J(x)=\sum_{n\leq \log_2x}\frac{\pi(x^{1/n})}{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\sigma-i\infty}^{\sigma+i\infty}\log\prod_{p}\left(1-\frac{1}{p^s}\right)^{-1}\frac{x^sds}{s}$$ $$=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\sigma-i\infty}^{\sigma+i\infty}\log\zeta(s)\frac{x^sds}{s},$$ where Riemann's ``explicit formula'' is derived by evaluating the integral in terms of the residues at the poles of the integrand, which is where the zeros and pole of $\zeta(s)$ come into play. Now, if you are looking for an explicit formula of the type you mention in your comments above then, by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, you can write your sum as $$I(x)=\sum _{k\leq \log_2 x}J_k(x)$$ where (1) $$J_k(x)=\sum_{n\leq \log_2x}\frac{\pi_k(x^{1/n})}{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\sigma-i\infty}^{\sigma+i\infty}\log\prod_{p_1,p_2,...,p_k}\left(1-\frac{1}{(p_1p_2\cdots p_k)^s}\right)^{-1}\frac{x^sds}{s}$$ and the product runs over all products of $k$ not necessarily distinct primes. Here, $\pi_k(x)$ counts the number of such products whose value is less than $x$. Of course, now you have an even bigger problem: in order to use your explicit formula, you need to know something about the zeros and poles of a whole load of new functions (the integrands in (1)), and establish that Cauchy's theorem can be applied to evaluate each of their inverse Mellin transforms. I hope at this point you can see that invoking the zeros of $\zeta(s)$ and related objects, i.e. involving the primes, is apparently unhelpful here. I think it is a much better idea to follow GH's advice above and work directly with the arithmetic structure that your Dirichlet series encodes. However, I must do this in a second answer because the software is struggling with my latex. 

A trivial application: The group $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$ is generated by no less than $n$ elements. [Probably this is the easiest way to prove that the free profinite group on $n$ letters cannot be topologically generated by less elements. And more abstractly, it is in general hard to find the minimal number of generators of a group, UNLESS it has a vector space quotient, and then we have dimension theory of vector spaces.] 

Motivation: The linear disjointness of the splitting fields allows one to calculate a Galois group of a composite of polynomials, which in turn yields arithmetic features of the ring of polynomials over large finite fields. Let me not elaborate on that here 

In fact, $H^1(K,M)$ is infinite not only to the family of number fields, but also to the more general family of Hilbertian fields (those fields which satisfies the Hilbert irreducibility theorem). Below is a proof based on embedding problems: Let $K$ be Hilbertian with absolute Galois group $G_K$ and $M$ a finite nontrivial $G_K$module. A finite embedding problem for a field $K$ is a pair of two epimorphisms (all morphisms in this answer are assumed to continuous) $$ \mathcal{E}=(\alpha\colon G_K\to G ; \beta \colon \Gamma\to G) $$ with $\Gamma$ finite. A solution of $\mathcal{E}$, in this answer, is an epimorphism $\psi\colon G_K \to \Gamma$ with $\alpha = \beta\circ \psi$. If $M$ is a finite $G_K$-module, then from continuity of the action, there exists an open subgroup $U$ of $G_K$ that acts trivially on $M$, and so the action factors through $G:=G_K/U$; let $\alpha\colon G_K\to G$ be the quotient map. Then, we have the semi-direct product $\Gamma = M\rtimes G$ and the projection map $\beta\colon \Gamma\to G$, which form the embedding problem $$ (1)\qquad \mathcal{E}=(\alpha\colon G_K \to G,\beta\colon \Gamma\to G), \qquad \Gamma =M\rtimes G, $$ We note that $\mathcal{E}$ is split in the sense that $\beta$ has a group theoretical section and $\mathcal{E}$ has an abelian kernel in the sense that $M = \ker\beta$ is abelian. In a similar fashion, for any $n>0$, we may construct the embedding problem $$ \mathcal{E}_n = (\alpha\colon G_K ; \beta_n \colon \Gamma_n \to G), $$ where $\Gamma_n = M^n\rtimes G$ and $\beta_n$ is the quotient map. To be precise, here $G$ acts on $M^n$ coordinate-wise; i.e., $g.(m_1,\ldots, m_n) := (g.m_1,\ldots, g.m_n)$. Theorem (Ikeda, [Fried-Jarden, Field Arithmetic 2nd edtn, Prop. 16.4.5]) If $K$ is Hilbertian, then any split embedding problem with abelian kernel has a solution; in particular, $\mathcal{E}_n$ has a solution $\Psi \colon G_K\to \Gamma_n$. We note that $\Psi$ gives rise to $n$ distinct solutions of $\mathcal{E}$: Proposition Under the notation above, let $\pi_i\colon \Gamma_n\to \Gamma$ be the projection map given by $\pi_i((m_1,\ldots,m_n)g) = (m_i,g)$. Then, a) $\psi_i = \pi_i\circ \Psi$ is a solution of $\mathcal{E}$. b) For all $i\neq j$ one has $\ker \psi_i \ker \psi_j = \ker \alpha$, and, in particular, if $M\neq 0$, then $\ker \psi_i\neq \ker \psi_j$. Proof. a) is immediate. For b), put $M'_i = \ker \pi$, so $M'_i = \{(m_1,\ldots, m_n)\in M^n : m_i=0\}$. Then if $i\neq j$, then \begin{equation}\label{eq:EQ} (2) \qquad M_i'M_j'=M^n. \end{equation} Note that we have $$ (3) \Psi^{-1}(M_i') =\ker \psi_i \quad \mbox{and} \quad \Psi^{-1}(M^n) = \Psi^{-1}(\ker\beta_n) = \ker (\beta_n\circ \Psi) = \ker \alpha, $$ Since $\Psi\colon G_K\to \Gamma_n$ is surjective, it induces a bijection between subgroups of $G_K$ containing $\ker \Psi$ and subgroups of $\Gamma_n$; namely, $H\leq \Gamma_n$ corresponds to $\Psi^{-1}(H)$. So (2) and (3) give that $$(4)\qquad \ker \psi_i \ker \psi_j = \ker \alpha. $$ If $M\neq 0$, then $M_i'\neq M^n$, and so $\ker \psi_i\lneq \ker\alpha$. Thus, (4) implies that $\ker\psi_i\neq \ker\psi_j$, and in particular $\psi_i\neq \psi_j$. QED Corollary If $M\neq 0$, then the embedding problem $\mathcal{E}$ given in (1) has infinitely many solutions. Each solution $\psi$ of $\mathcal{E}$ given in (1) induces a $1$-cocyle in $c\in H^1(K,M)$. Indeed, $c$ is defined by $$ \psi(g) = (c(g),\alpha(g))\in \Gamma $$ (recall that $G=G_K/U$ and $\alpha\colon G_K\to G$ is the quotient map) or equivalently by $$ c(g) = \psi(g) \alpha(g)^{-1}. $$ Obviously, these formulas imply that the map from solutions to cocycles is injective, and so the Corollary gives infinitely many cocycles, and so $H^1(K,M)$ is also infinite. 

There are several recent results on non-trivial bounded functions $f$ that are orthogonal, i.e. $$\sum_{n\leq x} \mu(n)f(n)=o(x),$$ to the Mobius function $\mu(n)$. These include the results of Green and Tao on Nilsequences (which includes information on the history of the problem) and Green on bounded depth circuits. The lecture notes by Peter Sarnak on Mobius randomness is an interesting overview of the subject. Sarnak mentions there that it is easy to construct counter examples, or examples which decay very slowly. Of course, its easy to do so if $f$ is sparsely supported or has partial sums that are the inverse Mellin transform of a function having positive powers of $\zeta(s)$ as factors. 

It is claimed on it's Wikipedia page that Euler's function, defined by the infinite product $\prod_1^\infty(1-q^n)$ for $|q|<1$, cannot be analytically continued outside the unit disc, that is, the unit disc is a natural boundary of the function. Unfortunately no proof is referred to. I would like to know how this claim is proved, as it appears to me that it is defined uniquely for $|q|>1$. 

For given continuous real functions $f$ and $g$ defined on $[-1,1]$, let's define $$ D(f,g) = \sup_{x \in [-1,1]} \left|{\frac{f(x)-g(x)}{f(x)}}\right| $$ (in this context, let's take $0/0$ to be $0$ and $x/0 = \infty$ for every $x \not= 0$). I am looking for a theory of approximation by polynomials with respect to this error that parallels the existing theory of approximation by polynomials with respect to the $L_\infty$-norm. For example: is it true that for every real $f$ continuous on $[-1,1]$ and every degree $n$ there exists a best approximating polynomial $p$ of degree $n$ in the sense that $D(f,p)$ is minimal among all polynomials of degree $n$? In such a case, can we find it or characterize it? I would like to know if this has been studied before and where. Edit: From the answers I got below, perhaps I should add that, in the application I have in mind, $f(x)$ may or may not be $0$ exactly at one place: at $x = 0$. This rules our infinitely many zeros in $[-1,1]$, and in case $f(0) = 0$, the best approximator $p(x)$ should be such that $p(0) = 0$ (my convention to take $0/0 = 0$ and $x/0 = \infty$ for $x \not= 0$ comes from this). 

Using some basic facts about Euler products it follows that $S(x)\in O(x^{1/2+\epsilon})$, $\epsilon>0$, but can $\epsilon$ be replaced by something explicit? 

I have checked this up to $x=50$ and for each such $x$ the $c(j,x)$ are positive and unimodal. For instance, for $1\leq x \leq 20$, the coefficients are: [1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4, 4], [1, 5, 5], [1, 4, 6], [1, 5, 7], [1, 6, 12, 8], [1, 6, 13, 9], [1, 5, 13, 10], [1, 6, 15, 11], [1, 6, 13, 12], [1, 7, 15, 13], [1, 6, 15, 14], [1, 5, 15, 15], [1, 6, 20, 30, 16], [1, 7, 23, 33, 17], [1, 7, 21, 32, 18], [1, 8, 24, 35, 19], [1, 8, 22, 34, 20]. 

I expect that this question is an elementary exercise in combinatorics, so hopefully somebody who knows more than me can explain. Specifically, if $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and $$f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_nx^n,$$ one obviously has $$f^m(x)=\sum_{n=m}^{\infty}\left(\sum_{k_1+k_2+\cdots + k_m=n}a_{k_1}a_{k_2}\cdots a_{k_m}\right)x^n.$$ The number of distinct products appearing in the iterated convolution is the integer partition number $p(n-m)$ so, writing the inner sum as (1) $$\sum_{j_1+2j_2+\cdots + mj_m=n}s_{n}(j_1,j_2,...,j_m)a^{j_1}_1a^{j_2}_2\cdots a^{j_m}_m,$$ the questions arise: What is the coefficient sequence of integers $s_{n}(j_1,j_2,...,j_m)$, explicitly? What is its combinatorial significance? EDIT: The fact that the number of terms in the sum is $p(n-m)$ is perhaps not so obvious, but you can reason as follows: note that the largest subscript that can appear in the coefficient of $x^n$ is $n-m+1$, because $n-m+1+(m-1)\times 1=n$. This restricts you to having only those partitions of $n$ whose largest part is $m-n+1$, that is, the set of solutions to the diophantine equation (2)$$ j_1+2j_2+\cdots +(n-m+1)j_{n-m+1}=n.$$ On the other hand, since there are a total of $m$ coefficients in each product (counting repetitions), you know that (3)$$j_1+j_2+\cdots +j_{n-m+1}=m.$$ Thus, subtracting (2) from (1), you get $$j_2+2j_3+\cdots +(n-m)j_{n-m+1}=n-m,$$ the number of distinct solutions to which is the partition number $p(n-m)$. I am trying to think of a better notation for the summation in (1), as I think it is definitely misleading. EDIT: I should've indexed everything by $+1$ so that (1) becomes $$\sum_{j_1+2j_2+\cdots +(n-m)j_{n-m}=n-m}s(j_1,j_2,...,j_{n-m})a_1^{m-(j_1+\cdots +j_{n-m})}a_2^{j_1}\cdots a_{n-m+1}^{j_{n-m}}.$$ 

The following questions popped out while I was preparing a course on profinite groups. Closed subgroups of free profinite groups are not necessarily profinite free (e.g. the p-sylow subgroups, or the kernel of the map on the maximum p quotient, and many more other examples) thus the Nielsen-Schreier theorem fails in the profinite category. Nevertheless, Nielsen-Schreier theorem carries over for open subgroups. The proofs I found (in Field Arithmetic by Fried-Jarden and in Profinite Groups by Ribes-Zalesskii) use the construction of free profinite groups as restricted completion of free abstract groups AND the Schreier basis of a finite indexed subgroup of a free abstract group. By restricted I mean that if X is a basis of a free abstract group, then the completion is w.r.t. the family of finite index normal subgroups that contain all but finitely many elements of X. 

It is a special case of thm 2.3 in $URL$ (version 3, I've just updated it, it has a different number in version 2) that the factorization pattern of polynomials $x^q-(ax^2+bx+c)$ distributes the same as random permutation in $S_n$ (unless $q$ is a power of $2$). In fact this theorem deals with $h(x) + (ax^2+bx+c)$, uniformly on $h$ of fixed degrees. In the case $x^{p^2} - (bx+c)$, for example, the factorization is related to cycle structure of permutations in the group of transformations of the affine line over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$, while in $x^{p^2+1}-(bx+c)$ it is related to the transformations of the projective line. See last section in the ms. 

It is known that $\zeta(s)$ has an infinity of zeros in the strip $0<\sigma<1$ and that those zeros become closer together as $t\rightarrow\infty$. More precisely, Littlewood showed that there is a zero $\rho=\beta+i\gamma$ with $|\gamma-t|\in O(1/\log\log\log t)$. A positive proportion of these zeros are known to have $\beta=1/2$, but $\zeta(1/2+it)$ is unbounded. In fact, $\zeta(\sigma+it)$ is bounded as $t\rightarrow\infty$ only if $\sigma>1+\delta$, $\delta>0$ fixed. On the other hand, there seem to be good reasons to expect that $$f(t)=\min_{0\leq\sigma\leq 1} |\zeta(s)|$$ approaches zero as $t\rightarrow\infty$. One reason is that zeros of $\zeta(s)$ are rather differently distributed than those of $\zeta(s)-z$ for any other value of $z$. I would like to argue that $f(t)\rightarrow 0$ here, but my approach is incomplete. In fact, I would like to conjecture that, for every $\epsilon>0$, we have $$f(t)\in O (\log^{\Theta(t) -1+\epsilon}t),$$ where $\Theta(t)=\max\{\beta:\gamma<t\} $. My questions are as follows: is anything at all non-trivial known about upper bounds on $f(t)$ and/or who has studied it? Does anyone have any computational data supporting this conjecture? Thanks!
