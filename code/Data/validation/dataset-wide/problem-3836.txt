In his doctoral dissertation held in Koenigsberg in 1885, Minkowski proposed the conjecture that, unlike the quadratic case, nonnegative homogeneous polynomials of higher degree and more than two variables in general cannot be written as a sum of squares of real polynomials. The problem attracted the attention of Hilbert who in 1888 proved nonconstructively the existence of such polynomials. However, the first concrete example of a nonnegative polynomial which is not a sum of squares seems to have been given only in 1967 by T. S. Motzkin [The arithmetic-geometric inequality, Inequalities (Proc. Sympos. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, 1965), pp. 205-224", Academic Press, New York, 1967]. 

Bala and Carter's approach to the classification of nilpotent orbits in complex semisimple Lie algebras $\mathfrak g$ is to associate to each nilpotent element $e\in\mathfrak g$ the pair $(\mathfrak l,\mathfrak q)$, where $\mathfrak l$ is a minimal Levi subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$ containing $e$ (unique up to $G_{ad}^e$-conjugation) and $\mathfrak q$ is the Jacobson-Morozov parabolic subalgebra associated to $e$. It turns out that $e$ is a so called distinguished element of $\mathfrak l'=[\mathfrak l,\mathfrak l]$ in the sense that the reductive part of the centralizer of $e$ in $\mathfrak l'$ is zero; equivalently, $\mathfrak q$ is a so called distinguished parabolic subalgebra of $\mathfrak l'$ in the sense that $\dim \mathfrak l_{\mathfrak q}=\dim \mathfrak u/[\mathfrak u,\mathfrak u]$ where $\mathfrak q=\mathfrak l_{\mathfrak q}\oplus\mathfrak u$ is the decomposition into reductive and unipotent parts, see the book by Collingwood and McGovern for details on this. If $\mathfrak g_{\mathbb R}$ is a real form of $\mathfrak g$ with Cartan decomposition $\mathfrak g_{\mathbb R}=\mathfrak k_{\mathbb R}+\mathfrak p_{\mathbb R}$ and complexification $\mathfrak g=\mathfrak k+\mathfrak p$ , the Kostant-Sekiguchi correspondence maps nilpotent (adjoint) orbits of $\mathfrak g_{\mathbb R}$ to nilpotent $K$-orbits in $\mathfrak p$ via the so called Cayley transform. Using this correspondence, Noel adapted Bala and Carter's ideas to the real case by establishing a bijective correspondence between nilpotent $K$-orbits in $\mathfrak p$ and triples $(\mathfrak l,\mathfrak q, \mathfrak n)$ where $\mathfrak l$ is a minimal ($\theta$, $\sigma$)-stable Levi subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$ containing $e$ ($\theta$ is the Cartan involution and $\sigma$ is the conjugation of $\mathfrak g$ over $\mathfrak g_{\mathbb R}$), $\mathfrak q$ is a $\theta$-stable parabolic subalgebra of $[\mathfrak l,\mathfrak l]$ and $\mathfrak n$ is a certain $L\cap K$-prehomogeneous subspace of $\mathfrak q\cap \mathfrak p$ containing $e$. It turns out that $e$ is a so called noticed element of $\mathfrak l'$ in the sense that the reductive part of the centralizer of $e$ in $L\cap K$ is trivial. Alternatively to Noel's approach, I have been wondering whether it makes sense and it is possible to carry out a classification of nilpotent orbits in real semisimple Lie algebras using minimal (real) Levi subalgebras and some class of real parabolic subalgebras? 

Instead of a condition on $G$, there is a simple condition on $H$. Proposition. For a compact connected Lie group $G$, the centralizer of any torus $S$ is precisely the union of all maximal tori of $G$ that contain $S$; in particular, it is connected. Proof: Let $g\in G$ centralize $S$. Then $S$ is contained in the connected centralizer $Z_G(g)^0$ of $g$, hence $S$ is contained in a maximal torus $T$ of $Z_G(g)$; but $T$ is also a maximal torus of $G$ (since we can always find a maximal torus of $G$ containing $g$). q.e.d. 

Complementing the answer of Jorge Vargas, there is a more recent paper on the classification of maximal (non-necessarily connected) subgroups of compact Lie groups by F. Antoneli, M. Forger & P.A. Gaviria: Maximal Subgroups of Compact Lie Groups; $URL$ to appear in J. Lie Theory. I think there are explicit lists for the classical groups. 

For $n\geq3$, it is the full space of $n\times n$ real matrices. The reason is that the $SO(n)$-orbit through the identity is the same as the $SO(n)\otimes SO(n)$-orbit by left and right multiplication, $(g,h)\cdot X=gXh^{-1}$, and this representation is irreducible for $n\geq3$. (Note that the span of any orbit is an invariant subspace, in general). 

Let us consider the case of $SL(n)$ acting on complex homogeneous polynomials of degree $k$ (the case of $GL(n)$ seems to follow easily). The space of such polynomials is canonically identified with $Sym^k(\mathbf C^{n*})$ and I guess undestanding this representation is a classical subject, although I'm non an expert on this subject. For instance, for non-singular cubics in three variables there is the Weierstrass normal form $y^2 z+x^3+pxz^2 +qz^3$ where $p$, $q\in\mathbf C$. This is a linear variety that intersects each orbit of maximal dimension at exactly one point. Since there is such section, the algebra of invariants is free. According to my references, this algebra is generated by two polynomials respectively of degrees $4$ and $6$, and the stabilizer in general position is $(\mathbf Z_3)^2$. The singular cubics are described in detail in Chapter I, section 7 of H. Kraft, , Vieweg. Check also the very nice survey by V. L. Popov and E. B. Vinberg in , Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences volume 55, Springer-Verlag for more results and references. 

In the simply-transitive case, there is the following result. Theorem. Let $G$ be a simply-transitive group of affine rigid motions acting on a finite dimensional Euclidean space $V$. Then $G$ is a connected solvable group, and there exists an orthogonal decomposition $V=U\oplus W$, where $U\neq0$, and a homomorphism $\varphi:V\to \mathfrak{so}(V)$ such that $\ker\varphi=U$, $\mathrm{im}\,\varphi$ is an Abelian subalgebra of $\mathfrak{so}(V)$ annihilating $W$ and preserving $U$, and \begin{equation} \mathfrak g=\{\tau_v+\varphi(v):v\in V\}, \end{equation} where $\tau_v:V\to V$ denotes translation by $v$. Proof. $G$ is diffeomorphic to $V$, thus connected and contractible. By The Levi-Malcev theorem, it is solvable. Consider the homomorphism $\pi:G\to SO(V)$ given by $\pi(g)=g_*$. Then $\mathfrak n=\ker d\pi$ is an ideal of $\mathfrak g$ and $\pi(G)$ is a solvable subgroup of $SO(V)$. The closure $\overline{\pi(G)}$ in $SO(V)$ is a compact solvable group, hence, Abelian. It follows that $\pi(G)$ is Abelian. The map $\theta:\mathfrak g\to V$, $\theta(X)=X\cdot 0$, is an isomorphism of vector spaces. Let $U=\theta(\mathfrak n)$ and $W=U^\perp$. If $U=0$, then $\mathfrak n=0$ and $d\pi[\mathfrak g]$ is an Abelian subalgebra of $\mathfrak{so}(V)$ of dimension $\dim\mathfrak g=\dim V$. However, the rank of $\mathfrak{so}(V)$ is at most $\frac12\dim V$, so this cannot be. It follows that $U\neq0$. Set $\varphi=d\pi\circ\theta^{-1}$. Note that $\varphi$ is a homomorphism between the Abelian Lie algebras $V$ and $d\pi[\mathfrak g]$. It is also clear that $\mathfrak g$ has the required form. Of course, $\ker\varphi=\theta(\ker d\pi)=\theta(\mathfrak n)=U$. Let $u\in U$, $w\in W$. Then $$[\tau_w+\varphi(w),\tau_u]=\tau_{\varphi(w)u} \in\mathfrak g, $$ so $\varphi(w)u\in \ker\varphi=U$. This shows that $\mathrm{im}\,\varphi$ preserves $U$ and, hence, the orthogonal decomposition $ V=U\oplus W$. Finally, if $w$, $w'\in W$, then $[\varphi(w),\varphi(w')]=0$, and so $$ [\tau_w+\varphi(w),\tau_{w'}+\varphi(w')]=\tau_{\varphi(w)w'} -\tau_{\varphi(w')w}=\tau_{\varphi(w)w'-\varphi(w')w} \in\mathfrak g. $$ This shows that $\varphi(w)w'-\varphi(w')w\in W\cap U=0$. Now the trilinear form on $W$ $$ (w,w',w'')\mapsto \langle\varphi(w)w',w''\rangle $$ is symmetric in the first two variables and skew-symmetric in the last two variables, hence, identically zero. This proves that $\varphi(W)W=0$ and completes the proof of the theorem. q.e.d. 

You can find a discussion in chapters 3 and 4 in Lie group actions in complex analysis, by Dmitri N. Akhiezer, Aspects of Mathematics, vol. E27, Friedr. Vieweg, Braunschweig and Wiesbaden, 1995. Edit: Thanks to abx for the further explanations and original papers. I just wanted to point out that the reducible case and the full automorphism group are also discussed in the book by Akhiezer. In the reducible case, the connected automorphism group splits as the direct product of the connected automorphism groups of the factors. Moreover $Aut(X)$ is the semidirect product of $Aut^0(X)$ by a finite group isomorphic to the subgroup of the automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram of the complex semisimple Lie group $Aut^0(X)$ preserving the vertices corresponding to the parabolic subalgebra. 

Consider the orthogonal group $G=O(n)$ acting on the space of real $n\times n$ symmetric matrices $V=Sym(n,\mathbf R)$ by conjugation, namely, $g\in O(n)$ acts on $A$ by $g\cdot A = gAg^{-1}=gAg^t$. The orbits of this action are the usual conjugacy classes of matrices. If we equip $V$ with the trace inner product $\langle A,B\rangle =trace(AB)$ then this action becomes isometric. Suppose now $A$ is a regular matrix, i.e. it has pairwise different eigenvalues. Then: 

G. Thorbergsson and I considered generalized real flag manifolds $G/P$ where $G$ is a noncompact real semisimple Lie group and $P$ is a parabolic subgroup. It is well known that those arise as orbits of representations of isotropy representations of symmetric spaces. In a celebrated paper in the 1950's, Bott and Samelson had constructed concrete cycles for those spaces which represent a basis for the $\mathbb Z_2$-homology. We wrote in the appendix an explicit (Lie-theoretic) proof that 

I hope this is not too elementary. Let $B: V\ \times V \to W$ be a skew-symmetric bilinear map where $V$, $W$ are finite dimensional real vector spaces. Assume that $B (u, v)$ is never zero for linearly independent $u$, $v\in V$. 

For a left-invariant vector field $X$ on $G$, denote by $X^R$ the right-invariant vector field with the same value at the identity. From $\iota_*X=\iota_*L_{g*}X=R_{g^{-1}*}\iota_*X$, we see that $\iota_*X$ is right-invariant, where $\iota$ is the inversion map $g\mapsto g^{-1}$. Since $\iota_*X(1)=-X(1)$, we get $X^R=-\iota_*X$. Finally, $[X^R,Y^R]=[-\iota_*X,-\iota_*Y]=\iota_*[X,Y]=-[X,Y]^R$. 

This seems to be an old remark by Andreotti and appears as exercise 2.6.10 in the book by D. Huybrechts. The tangent bundle of $M$ is complexified and $\omega$ is viewed as a complex $2$-form. An almost complex structure is equivalent to a decomposition $TM^{\mathbf C}=T^{1,0}M\oplus T^{0,1}M$, where $T^{0,1}M=\overline{T^{1,0}M}$. If $\omega$ is to be holomorphic, then it must vanish on $T^{0,1}M$. This will give uniqueness. The conditions $\omega\wedge\omega=0$ and $\omega\wedge\bar\omega$ a volume form imply that the kernel of $\omega$ is $2$-dimensional, so can define $\ker\omega=T^{0,1}M$, and this will give existence. In fact, by skew-symmetry the rank of $\omega$ is even; the first condition implies that $\omega$ is not symplectic so the kernel is non-trivial; the second condition implies that it cannot be $4$-dimensional, hence the claim. Next we let $T^{1,0}M$ be the complex conjugate of $T^{0,1}M$, that is, $\ker\bar\omega$. The condition $\omega\wedge\bar\omega$ never zero says that $T^{1,0}M\cap T^{0,1}M=0$, so we have the desired decomposition. Finally, to check the integrability, it suffices to see that $T^{0,1}M$ is involutive. Let $X$, $Y$ be sections of $T^{0,1}M$ and $Z$ be an arbitrary section of $TM^{\mathbf C}$. Recall the formula $d\omega(X,Y,Z) = X\omega(Y,Z)-Y\omega(X,Z)+Z\omega(X,Y) - \omega([X,Y],Z)+\omega([X,Z],Y)-\omega([Y,Z],X) $. We have $d\omega=0$ and all the terms on the RHS vanish by our choice of $X$, $Y\in\ker\omega$ except $d\omega([X,Y],Z)$. Hence this term also vanish and this means that $[X,Y]$ lies in $\ker\omega$. 

I believe this is worked out very nicely in "Geometrization of Three-Dimensional Orbifolds via Ricci Flow" by Bruce Kleiner, John Lott ($URL$ An atlas for an $n$-orbifold $\mathcal O$ consists of a Hausdorff paracompact topological space $|\mathcal O|$ together with an open covering $\{U_\alpha\}$, local models $\{(\hat U_\alpha,G_\alpha)\}$ ($U_\alpha$ connected open subset of $\mathbb R^n$) and homeomorphisms $\varphi_\alpha:U_\alpha\to \hat U_\alpha/G_\alpha$ satisfying a compatibility condition. An orbifold is then defined by an equivalence class of such atlas. (See page 6 of Kleiner-Lott.) A smooth map $f:\mathcal O_1\to\mathcal O_2$ between orbifolds is given by a continuous map $|f|:|\mathcal O_1|\to |\mathcal O_2|$ with the property that for each $p\in |\mathcal O_1|$, there are local models $(\hat U_i,G_i)$ ($i=1$, $2$) and a smooth map $\hat f:\hat U_1\to \hat U_2$ equivariant with respect to a homomorphism $\rho:G_1\to G_2$ such that $\pi_2\circ \hat f = |f|\circ \pi_1$ where $\pi_i:\hat U_i \to U_i$ is the projection ($\rho$ is not required to be injective or surjective). (See page 7 of Kleiner-Lott.) I think this satisfies your requirements and is in the spirit of Thurston. Edit: Perhaps I should mention Remark 2.8 in the Kleiner-Lott paper (also in regard to other answers to this post), which recalls that an orbifold can also be seen as a smooth proper étale grupoid (and Morita-equivalent grupoids correspond to equivalent orbifolds). A grupoid morphism gives rise to an orbifold map, but these correspond to a stricter class of maps called good maps. The advantage of these maps is that one can pull back orbi-vector bundles. 

See Theorem 2.1 (b) in arXiv:math/0505268 [math.SG] for the symplectic case. The orthogonal case should be similar. 

In fact, for $u\in V$, $u\neq0$, the linear map $B_u : V\to W$, $B_u(v)=B(u,v)$, is injective on a codimension $1$ subspace of $V$. Can the above estimate be improved? Recall that the image of a bilinear map does not need to be a subspace. 

Let a reductive group $G$ act on an affine variety $X$ (assume the base field $k$ is algebraically closed and of characteristic zero). Since the algebra of invariants $k[X]^G$ is finitely generated and does not contain nilpotents, the affine variety $X/\!/G:=Spec\, k[X]^G$ is defined. The morphism $\pi:X\to X/\!/G$ induced by the embedding $k[X]^G\to k[X]$ is constant on the orbits of $G$. Some additional, easy to check properties: $\pi$ is surjective, sends invariant closed sets in $X$ to closed sets in $X/\!/G$, and any fiber of $\pi$ is a union of orbits and contains a unique (Zariski-) closed orbit which is of minimum dimension among orbits in the fiber (this is rather elementary, you do not need Luna's slice etale for that). Note that $\pi^{-1}(\pi(x))=\{y\in X| x\in cl(G\cdot y)\}$ if $G\cdot x$ is a closed orbit. Any orbit $\mathcal O$ is open in its closure, so $cl(\mathcal O)\setminus\mathcal O$ is a union of orbis of strictly lower dimension, see J. Humphreys book on Linear Algebraic Groups, Proposition in section 8.3. In the projective case, results are different, as Allen pointed out in the example. The results for non-algebraically closed fields, e.g., real algebraic actions, are slightly more complicated. I refer you to the excellent paper (I do not have time now, I will elaborate on that later if necessary) MR1285780 (95f:14090) Reviewed Bremigan, Ralph J.(1-BLS) Quotients for algebraic group actions over non-algebraically closed fields. J. Reine Angew. Math. 453 (1994), 21–47. 14L30 (14D25) PDF Clipboard Journal Article Make Link Let $k$ be a field of characteristic zero, not necessarily algebraically closed. The author studies the geometric invariant theory (GIT) quotients over a such a field. Let G be a reductive algebraic group acting on an affine variety V, both defined over the closure of k. The standard GIT quotient $V/\!/G$ exists. Let $(V_k,G_k)$ be the $k$-points of $(V,G)$. The author discusses the space $X=\pi(V_k)$ as a quotient object for the action of $G_k$ on $V_k$, where $\pi:V\to V//G$ is the GIT quotient map. If $k$ is local, there is a second possibility: the space $V_k/\!/G_k$ of closed $G_k$-orbits in $V_k$ is Hausdorff and supports a quotient map $p:V_k\to V_k/\!/G_k$. The main results are in $\S5$.
