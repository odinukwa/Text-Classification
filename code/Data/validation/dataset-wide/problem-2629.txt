The short answer is "yes". For Descartes the res is a substance on its own, and the term did derive from scholasticism. In the scholastic jargon, "res" (which literally just means "thing") was first used to be the name of any kind of entity whatsoever, be it a substance, an accident, a transcendental principle (such as unity, goodness, etc.). The term evolved in the context of a debate about the subject matter of metaphysics. What is metaphysics about? Aristotle says both that the subject matter of metaphysics is substance and that the subject matter of metaphysics is reality in general, being qua being. Briefly, the idea of the term "res" is that you can say that everything that is a res is part of the study of metaphysics in some way. Either because the thing you are talking about is a substance, or the principle of a substance, or an accident of a substance, etc. In Descartes's usage though, it is clear that the res extensa and the res cogitans are both substances, less because of the use of the word "res" and more just because of the way Descartes describes both. The crucial fact is that Descartes thinks they can exist independently of each other. 

(Not a linguist, so take this with a grain of salt, but I believe it's accurate.) So, first we need to divide which is the bit of linguistics concerned with grouping languages into historical families from what we might call which is more closely aligned to psychology and the cognitive sciences. Let me say a bit about methods in historical linguistics. To create a family tree of languages you first start by gathering words with similar meanings that look obviously related: 

No. Physicalists are willing to say there are things that are non-physical, in the sense that we can describe, for particular human purposes physical objects using a vocabulary which is not itself reducible to the vocabulary of fundamental physics. For instance, "being a king in chess" won't ever be reducible to a physical property because you can make any kind of physical thing the king in a game of chess if you want. But physicalists need not deny there are such things as Kings. Rather, the point physicalists are making is that the causal story of the universe is a completely physical story---a being who knew all the fundamental physical facts would know all the facts you needed to know in order to know about the universe. That such a being didn't know about chess wouldn't matter, since chess playing is just a human convention and the chess pieces don't cause any physical events qua chess pieces. The physicalist would just say the same thing about values. The fact that the super mind doesn't know about justice doesn't mean that physicalism is false, it just means that justice is a way human beings have of describing certain features of the world relevant to particular human concerns and interests. The point is that a situation's being just or unjust isn't going to cause any physical changes in the universe. 

Ok, I think I have a better bead on what you're asking now. Let's distinguish two things: how to act responsibly in the public's interest with the public's money, and how to avoid the perception of snobbishness, or insularity. The former is an ethical question, the latter is a PR question. I think the ethical question is the important one. The way you get elected to one of these important gatekeeper positions is by being an eminent figure in your field with outstanding talent and a lifetime of important, significant work that is highly valued by your colleagues. Further, you are going to have to have a reputation for fair-mindedness and good judgment. You pretty much have to be such a person to be prominent enough to be asked to help decide who will receive public funds for scholarship or the arts. Basically at this level the standards would be the same as for editing a journal or evaluating grant proposals or refereeing articles. You pick the best work. I think this is legitimate--what is required to exercise this function is an incredibly high level of expertise, something that is necessarily rare. There simply aren't going to be reliable external mechanisms that laypeople can use to determine whether you are using your expertise correctly or not--otherwise the decision wouldn't have required expertise in the first place. In other words, the public is putting its faith in you to be honest and use your expertise on their behalf to make judgments they aren't capable of and there's nothing keeping you from screwing up except your own integrity. This is why a reputation for uprightness is important. So my answer to this question is the same as to the previous one: what makes it legitimate is that there isn't really any meaningful alternative. The upshot is that your question makes very clear the importance of "non-academic" factors like honesty and integrity for the public perception of scientific and intellectual endeavors. I hope this helps. 

You're on to something important--Buridan (like members of both the via antiqua and via moderna logicians who preceded him) was interested in distinguishing signification from supposition. This is analogous to the modern distinction between and . However, there are important differences between Quine and Buridan's philosophies of logic, too. One of the most clear differences concerns what they say about empty terms (i.e. terms whose referents don't exist, like "Julius Caesar"). For Quine, such terms fail to refer. He thinks this is because if you say empty terms refer, then you have to admit that there are some things (the objects referred to) which aren't (because they don't exist.) Buridan would deny this. Buridan thinks that names don't refer outside the context of a whole sentence, and so you don't know what the name is genuinely supposed to refer to until you have a tensed verb involved (like "was" in "Julius Caesar was a roman emperor"). If you've got a past tense verb, then you know you have a linguistic context where the speaker is not literally asserting the existence of the object at the present time, and so you have no worries about there having to be something there is not to make his assertion true. For more details, I strongly encourage you to take a look at Gyula Klima's Quine, Wyman, and Buridan: Three Approaches to Ontological Commitment, Korean Journal of Logic, 2005. It's not an easy paper, per se, but it's directly relevant to your question. 

The difference between an intension and an extension in contemporary logic comes from Frege, who distinguishes a concept's Sinn (sense) from its Bedeutung (reference). The easiest way to illustrate the difference between sense and reference is through cases. The predicates "having a kidney" and "having a heart" clearly have different senses, but as a matter of contingent fact everything that has a kidney has a heart: hence we case the two terms are co-referential. The set of the renates = the set of the cordates, because set membership is extensional. First order logics, including set theory are all extensional in this sense. It doesn't matter whether we are talking about the set of the renates or the set of the cordates, because they are the same set, and we know they're the same set, because we define a set extensionally--i.e. purely by the reference of the terms. We don't need to know what the terms "renate" and "cordate" really mean, we just need to know which things they refer to. An intensional logic, however we do need to know what the terms mean, because we want to ask not just about which things do, as a matter of contingent fact, happen to fall under those terms. For instance, modal logic is an intensional logic. Take the set of all things that have hearts. The sentence, "every renate is a cordate" can be checked by examining every item in the domain and checking that all the things that actually have kidneys also actually have hearts. But, "Necessarily, every renate is a cordate" can't be checked this way. Even if it is the case that all renates are actually cordates, this is just a contingent fact. So to establish the truth or falsity of the modal sentence requires me to have some kind of model that isn't just looking at the referents of the terms "renate" and "cordate", it's going to have to have something to do with knowing the meaning of the terms, etc. It is because modal logic isn't extensional that lots of people in the first half of the 20th century were suspicious of it. (Think of Quine here.) That's the neat thing about Kripke style model theory for modal logic. It provides something that looks a lot like extensional semantic theory for an intensional logic. It doesn't make modal logic extensional, but it does open up the possibility of using nice model theoretical techniques that were designed for extensional logics on modal logic as well. Since getting access to those techniques, we can prove consistency, and some other metalogical results for some modal logics, which have led to renewed interest in these logics among philosophers. There are other intensional logics as well. Modal logic is just one prominent example. 

You need some extra clauses if your logic includes quantifiers or modal operators, but the basic idea is the same. The definition of a WFF isn't circular--it relies upon the primitive notion of an atomic formula, but that isn't circular. 

Hume's thesis is that all of our ideas are copies of our sense impressions. That is, Hume is saying any mental representation we have of some real or imaginary thing must derive in some way from our experience. But what does it mean to say our mental representations are derivable from experience in this way? The missing shade of blue objection is important because it shows that Hume thinks about this requirement about derivability from experience in a broad, and plausible way. To see what Hume is up to, consider the differences between the following different versions of the derivability requirement. Strong Derivability You might initially think that Hume thinks we could only think about things we have actually, personally witnessed, touched, heard, etc. Strong derivability is very implausible though. I think about lots of things that I personally have never seen. (Unicorns, for instance.) So if what Hume meant was that all of our mental representations were strongly derivable from our experience, his thesis would be false. It is pretty clear just from Hume's explicit words though that this isn't his view, since he often uses imaginary beings as examples of things we have ideas about. Moderate Derivability is the view that we can think about things whose mental representations are composed of pieces or parts, which are things that we have personally witnessed, touched, heard, etc. On this view, there would be no problem with my thinking about a unicorn, since I have personally seen both horses and horns and I am capable of combining those two separate representations into a new representation of a thing which is a horse with a horn on its head. Now the person who is challenging Hume about the missing shade of blue is assuming moderate derivability is Hume's view. So, the objection is that moderate derivability is still too strong a requirement, because I can think about things that I never experienced at all. For example, there are lots of shades of blue. Imagine them all next to one another on a color wheel. It is certainly possible that there are three adjacent shades of blue on the color wheel, blue1, blue2, and blue3 such that I have personally experienced blue1 and blue3, but not blue2. Nevertheless, the objector says, I can form a very clear and definite idea of what blue2 must look like, just by imagining what must come between blue1 and blue3. Now if that's the case, then it looks like I have a (simple) idea of something that I never experienced, and hence it looks like the moderate derivability requirement is false. Now Hume responds to this that he is quite happy to acknowledge that we can come to think of blue2 in this way, without ever having directly experienced it. All I am committed to, Hume might say, is a thesis much weaker than moderate derivability. Weak derivability If I have a mental representation of X, then there is some thing Y (not necessarily identical to X) which I have personally experienced, such that my idea of X can be derived from Y. Notice that the missing shade of blue objection doesn't tell against weak derivability because my ability to think of blue2 is still dependent upon my having had experiences of other things that were blue1 and blue3. Hume is considering the objection, because it helps him make clear that his thesis is only this far weaker (and therefore, more plausible) claim. 

As far as I know the verb for to be can be used in each of these separate ways in English, German, French, Latin, Ancient Greek and Hebrew. I can't speak to other languages, but I imagine there are similar uses. 

John Hospers's Introduction to Philosophical Analysis was written as an introductory textbook, with a strong emphasis on providing logical analyses of important arguments. link There's also a book called Just the Arguments which I think provides nice little argument analyses from the great philosophers. link I haven't used either text myself, so I can't vouch for the quality, but they seem to fit the description you're looking for. 

This is controversial, both as an interpretation of Aristotle, and as a solution to the problem, but my view is that Aristotle believes in . In other words, It is possible for the marble to be the same marble, but different materials. It is possible for you to be the same human organism, but a different collection of cells, etc. This is because, as Mauro points out in the comment above, Aristotle ties the identity over time of a composite material object to the of the object rather than its . As long as the same form remains actively shaping the matter into a unity, then the individual bits of matter can come and go, while the composite remains the same. 

An example of a kind of "practical work" influenced by Cartesian philosophy is the Port Royal Logic, which was written by Arnauld and Nicole, and Pascal may have contributed as well.
