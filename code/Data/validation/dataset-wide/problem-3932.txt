There are several constructions. My original machine in Geo (The Geometry of iterated loop spaces), Thm 13.1, gave $B(\Sigma,E_1,X)$ as a delooping of an $E_1$-space $X$, using your notation. (The cited result works for $E_n$-spaces for all $n$. One can also convert $X$ to an equivalent topological monoid $B(M,E_1,X)$, by Thm 13.4 of Geo, and take the ordinary classifying space of that. These two constructions are compared in papers by Thomason and Fiedorowicz, circa 1980, or maybe earlier. This is answered affirmatively for all $n$ in my original work, in part (vi) of Thm 13.1: $B(\Sigma^n,E_n,\Omega^nY)$ is weakly equivalent to $Y$ if $Y$ is $n$-connected. The proviso can be improved to $n-1$-connected. It is then obviously necessary, since applying $\Omega^n$ loses any information about $\pi_0$ through $\pi_{n-1}$. 

An axiomatization of exactly how smash products of cofiber sequences should behave is given in the context of triangulated categories in my paper The additivity of traces in triangulated categories. Advances in Mathematics 163(2001), 34--73. Of course, the axioms hold in the motivating example of the homotopy category of spectra. 

Well if you insist John :) (1) The first explicit formulation I know of is in the nice paper: Klaus Wirthmuller. Equivariant homology and duality. Manuscripta Math. 11 (1974), 373â€“390. He writes: "The ideas developed here partly originate from suggestions made by T. tom Dieck, who introduced me to the subject." They were thinking about equivariant Poincar\'e duality and about equivariant cobordism, which make $RO(G)$ grading inevitable. (2) That may be tom Dieck and may be me. I'm honestly not sure. I was explicitly using universes nonequivariantly in 1972, with good reason. I think tom Dieck may have at least implicitly used complete universes in his work on cobordism. Certainly I was using complete $G$-universes by some time around or before 1974-75. The question is confused by the fact that tom Dieck was in Chicago lecturing on equivariant things that year. See Tammo tom Dieck. The Burnside ring and equivariant stable homotopy. Lecture notes by Michael C. Bix. Department of Mathematics, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill., 1975. (3) The Segal conjecture in its simplest form dates from 1970. However, early work on it was not based on equivariant stable homotopy theory, let alone $RO(G)$ grading. As late as 1983, Frank Adams wrote a paper ``Graeme Segal's Burnside ring conjecture'' in which he barely mentioned equivariant cohomotopy, and then a bit skeptically. There is a 1982 paper "Classifying $G$-spaces and the Segal conjecture'' by Lewis, McClure, and myself that proves the equivalence of the nonequivariant and equivariant versions of the Segal conjecture, before Carlsson's proof. It is worth emphasizing that, in a sense, $RO(G)$-grading has no philosophical justification. Logically, grading should be on the equivariant Picard group which is considerably larger (at least under space level equivalence) or on the stable equivalence classes of representation spheres (and their negatives), which is considerably smaller. 

Yes. This is classical, maybe originally in Milnor and Moore's paper on Hopf algebras. For a recent exposition see for example "More concise algebraic topology" by Kate Ponto and myself. If $X$ is a connected $H$-space (say with finitely generated rational homology groups), then the rationalized Hurewicz homomorphism is a monomorphism with image the primitive elements of $H_*(X;\mathbf Q)$. The essential point is that the rationalization of $X$ is equivalent to a product of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. 

(This is an answer to a question below from Akhil Mathew; he wanted examples of ``explicit computations'' since all he knew were classical 1950s calculations and abstract theory. My answer is too long for a comment and too short to do justice to the question.) That is terrible!!! I don't know where to begin, since there are huge masses of explicit calculations in the past half century. You mention infinite loop spaces. There is a theorem that says that the ordinary mod $p$ homology of $\Omega^n\Sigma^n X$ is an explicit functor of the ordinary mod $p$ homology of $X$, with all information (product, Dyer-Lashof operations, coproduct, Steenrod operations) determined. That surely sounds conceptual, but try to find a conceptual proof! We have tons of explicit calculations in the classical and Novikov Adams spectral sequences, without which the solution of the Kervaire invariant problem would be unthinkable. Chromatic theory as a whole is informed by explicit calculations. In unstable homotopy theory, exponent theorems for the homotopy groups of spheres use a remarkable blend of theoretic and calculational techniques. There are tons of explicit calculations in ordinary and generalized cohomology in the past half century. Spin cobordism and its applications to curvature questions is an example of a blend of algebraic topology and differential geometry. I could go on for 100s of pages without pausing for breath, and none of these results use any model category theory, let alone $\infty$ categories. There is a subject out there, with real content. 

There are old-fashioned classical ways to think about excision, which can easily be translated into model theoretical language of homotopy pushouts as desired. Any excisive triad can be approximated up to weak equivalence of triads by a CW triad, where a CW triad (X;A,B) is just a CW complex X that is the union of subcomplexes A and B (theorem on page 77 of "A concise course in algebraic topology"). A CW triad is not excessive, but it is homotopy equivalent to the obvious double mapping cylinder, which is excessive (lemma on page 78). Note that excision in any homology theory is obvious for a CW triad since A/A cap B is isomorphic as a CW complex to X/B. The Blakers-Massey theorem is given an easy homotopical proof from this CW approximation result on page 85, opus cit. No originality is claimed: I'm pretty sure I learned the idea from Boardman (probably unpublished). Chapter 17 of "More concise algebraic topology" has a reasonably thorough treatment of the three model structures and their comparison. The mixed model structure is due to Cole. (However `More Concise' unfortunately has a mistake, taken from a different paper of Cole, in the proof of the axioms for the Strom model structure; a nice paper of Barthel and Riehl, "On the construction of functorial factorizations for model categories" explains and corrects the mistake.) 

I don't have time to look into the mathematics, but you should take a look at the classic little paper $Spin(8)$, triality, $F_4$, and all that, by Frank Adams. It is in Superspace and supergravity, Cambridge University Press 1981. (Also in Volume II of Adams' collected works). It starts with the identification of the automorphism group of $Spin(8)$ with the symmetric group $\Sigma_3$ and it has the construction of the exceptional Jordan algebra of dimension 27. 

But there is a standard old answer. Take the total singular complex, the geometric realization of the simplicial set whose $n$-simplices are the singular $n$-simplices of a space $X$. That is a perfectly good ordinary CW complex $TX$, and its cellular chain complex is naturally isomorphic to the singular chain complex of $X$. There is a natural weak equivalence $TX\to X$ tying ideas together, one of the classical forerunners of model category theory, surely known to Quillen. This is all in my Concise text $URL$ 

This result has nothing special to do with compact Lie groups: it works for arbitrary topological groups $G$. And as Karol gently points out, the "expected $G$-homotopy extension property" actually means "retracts of relative $G$-cell complexes". The fibrations, like the weak equivalences are created by the fixed point functors: $p$ is a $G$-fibration iff $p^H$ is a nonequivariant Serre fibration for all closed subgroups $H$. This is the ``Quillen model structure''; it was understood in the 1980's. There is also a classical or Hurewicz model structure whose weak equivalences are the $G$-homotopy equivalences and whose $G$-fibrations are the Hurewicz $G$-fibrations, defined by the $G$-CHP, and whose $G$-cofibrations really do have the $G$-HEP, which I imagine may be what the question had in mind. There is also a mixed model structure in which the weak equivalences are those of the Quillen model structure and the fibrations those of the Hurewicz model structure. Its cofibrations are the Hurewicz cofibrations that factor as composites of Quillen cofibrations and $G$-homotopy equivalences. The proofs are really no different than in the nonequivariant case. Some references on my web page are $URL$ (Section VI.5), $URL$ (Theorem 1.8 there gives the same result as Schwede's A.1.18, with a little more detail about the properties of the Quillen model structure), and $URL$ (Chapter 17) 

A short paper with references to several early counterexamples proves that (in the good category of compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces) a Serre fibration in which the total space and base space are both CW complexes is necessarily a Hurewicz fibration. M. Steinberger and J. West. Covering homotopy properties of maps between CW complexes or ANRs. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 92(1984), 573-577. (The proof is corrected in R. Cauty. Sur les overts des CW-complexes et les fibr\'es de Serre. Colloquy Math. 63(1992), 1--7). No relationship between the covering map and the CW structures is required. This argues either that counterexamples are pathological or that it is a special property for the total space of a Serre fibration with CW base space to be a CW complex, although it has the homotopy type of a CW complex if the fiber does. 

The proof of Spanier's 6.5.12 starts from a free chain complex with homology of finite type and replaces it by a quasi-isomorphic free chain complex of finite type. Then the conclusion reduces directly to application of the usual universal coefficient theorem for computing cohomology of chain complexes from homology. The reference to EKMM should be to p. 82, which states "A reference to Adams [1] is mandatory''; [1] is "Lectures on generalized cohomology". Springer Lecture Notes 99, 1969, pp 1--138. As recalled on EKMM p. 82, Adams shows how to deduce further spectral sequences from those listed on that page, by duality. Adams' (UCT 4), page 5 op cit, gives the spectral sequence that generalizes the result cited from Spanier to generalized homology/cohomology theories.
