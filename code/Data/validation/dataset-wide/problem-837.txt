The bulk motion of the gas would contribute to the relativistic mass-energy of the compact object. White dwarfs are not produced by collapse, so there is nothing to comment on here. Neutron stars are produced by collapse. Most of the kinetic energy is lost in the form of neutrinos, the rest would be thermalised within the neutron star, increasing the kinetic energy of its constituent particles (which become partially relativistic) and that energy does contribute to the gravitational mass. When a black hole forms then all the mass-energy that goes into its formation contributes to its gravitational mass. 

You are correct - when we look at stars in the sky, about half of them are actually binary systems, with a range of separations. The frequency of binarity is strongly mass dependent; the 50% figure is appropriate for stars like the Sun, but it appears to be closer to 100% for high-mass O-stars and as small as 20% for the lowest mass M-dwarf stars. There is also a change in the separation (and corresponding orbital period) distribution. The distributions of separations looks "log-normal" (like a Gaussian when you plot log separation on the x-axis). For solar type stars the peak is at around 50-100 au, but binaries become more compact (maybe 10-30 au) for low-mass stars. There is a tail of binaries with much smaller and larger separations. These observational data are explained (or are in the process of being explained) as a combination of nature and nurture. The basic process of star formation results from the collapse and fragmentation of molecular clouds. If a collapsing fragment has significant angular momentum then the most energetically favourable way it can continue to collapse whilst conserving angular momentum is to sub-fragment into two pieces orbiting each other. This is thought to be the most basic binary formation process. Other processes include the formation of low mass companions through instabilities in cicumstellar disks or interactions between young stars in dense protostellar environments. Exactly how this leads to the mass dependence of the binary frequency and separation distribution is a topic of contemporary research; there is no definitive answer I can give. After that I think there are two basic ways, or rather two basic locations, in which planets could form in a binary stem. Either around one or other of the stars or as circumbinary objects. The likelihood of each will depend how and when the binary formed, the binary component separation and mass ratio. The planets would likely form in the same way that they do around single stars. If the binary star components are originally formed close together, there could be a circumbinary disk from which a stable planetary system formed. Both circumbinary disks and circumbinary planets have been observed. Disks around individual components are truncated by tidal forces at a radius roughly corresponding to a third of the binary separation. Inside this radius it may be possible to form planets. Thus widely separated binaries could have planets orbiting the individual stars. 

Your question is too general, you need to get to specific examples. First, very few neutron stars are pulsars. Pulsars are either a brief phase during a pulsar's spin-down at the start of a neutron star's life, or they are the product of the spin-up of a neutron star in a binary system. Most neutron stars fall in neither of these categories. A standard neutron star will look like any other star at a similar temperature. Most of them will be very hot indeed - 100,000 K or more, though the cooling histories of neutron stars are still uncertain and depend on some exotic physics. Such an object is "white hot" - it emits black body radiation at all frequencies visible to the eye (as well as lots more at UV wavelengths). How close would you have to get for it's apparent luminosity/magnitude to match the Sun? Well that depends on the size and temperature of the neutron star. Most are thought to have a diameter of 20 km. The way you would do the calculation is equate the blackbody radiative flux per unit area at a given distance to the solar radiation constant of about 1300 W per square metre. However, there are two wrinkles for a neutron star: First, the radiation is gravitationally redshifted, so the temperature we measure is lower than the temperature at the surface. Second, General Relativity tells us that we can see more than just a hemisphere of the neutron star - i.e. we can see around the back - and this increases the flux we observe. These are roughly factor of two effects, so just to get an order of magnitude estimate, ignore GR and assume a 10 km radius NS with $T=10^{5}$ K. Using Stefan's law for a blackbody, then at a distance $d$, we have that $$\frac{4 \pi r^2}{4\pi d^2} \sigma T^4 = 1300\ W\ m^{-2},$$ where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. For $r=10$ km, then $d=7 \times 10^{8}$ m, which is coincidentally about a solar radius. Of course this distance depends on the square of the temperature, so a younger NS with $T=10^6$ K, then $d \sim 1$ au. These are the distances where the total flux at all wavelengths would be similar to that from the Sun. To do the calculation just for the visible range we need to account for the bolometric correction, which converts a visual magnitude to a bolometric magnitude. The bolometric correction for the Sun is $\sim 0$, whereas the bolometric correction for a very hot star could be -5 mag. This means that only 1% as much flux from the hot neutron star emerges in the visible band compared with sunlight. This means that the distances calculated above, if we require the visual brightness of the neutron star be similar to the Sun, must be reduced by a factor of 10. To turn to pulsars. Note that the pulsed radiation does have an optical component and pulsed optical radiation has been seen from a number of pulsars. Optical synchrotron emission would just appear to be a periodic, intense brightening of the pulsar, as the beam sweeps across the line of sight. If you were not in the line of sight, then you would not see the pulsed optical emission. If you could observe the beam passing through nebulosity or some other medium around the pulsar then yes there may well be some effects you could see in terms of ionisation or scattered light coming from along the beam path. Lastly, the gravitational lensing effect. Yes, this should be strong close to a neutron star. The deflection angle (in radians) is given by $$ \alpha = \frac{4GM}{c^2 b},$$ where $b$ is how close the light passes to the neutron star and $M$ is the neutron star mass. Expressing $b$ in terms of the 10km radius of the neutron star: $$ \alpha \simeq 0.83 \left(\frac{M}{1.4M_{\odot}}\right) \left(\frac{b}{10 km}\right)^{-1},$$ where strictly speaking this formula is only valid for $\alpha \ll 1$. So consider a planet directly behind the neutron star at a distance of 1 au. The light from this would only need to be bent through an angle of $\sim 2 \times 10\ km/1\ au \sim 10^{-7}$ radians in order to be seen from a planet diametrically opposite at a distance of 1 au. So this is easily possible. However, the image would likely be highly distorted, especially if the neutron star was spinning. It would not look dissimilar to this simulated black hole image, but with a bright neutron star in the middle rather than a black disc.
