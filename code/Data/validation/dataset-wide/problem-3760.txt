You need the field extension to have transcendence degree 1 over $\mathbb{C}$ to get a Riemann surface. More generally, you can get an algebraic curve at least for every transcendence degree 1 extension over an algebraically closed field. Chapter I of Hartshorne does this in detail, I don't know an analytic approach. 

As for what "is" means here, it means "is naturally isomorphic to" that is, you should be able to find an isomorphism that doesn't depend on any choices you make (that is, it'll be functorial). As for if there's an isomorphism of sheaf hom to some hom of rings, keep in mind that $\mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{O}_X}(J/J^2|_X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ is a sheaf, whereas between rings you get a set and between modules a group (in fact, module) of homomorphisms. For understanding this theorem, you don't really want to see the normal bundle as something else. Really, you want to think about what is a tangent vector at a point of the Hilbert scheme? It's a morphism from $k[\epsilon]/\epsilon^2$ to it, which means that if you take the pullback along it, you'll be looking at infinitesimal embedded deformations. Think about why these are locally local sections of the normal bundle, and then glue them together to see that a global infinitesimal embedded deformation will be a global section quite naturally, without needing to see the global sections as something else at all. 

I'm not sure exactly what question you're asking. I think you may be looking for the following answer. By the decomposition theorem, the intersection cohomology of the variety is a direct summand of the cohomology of the resolution. I'm not sure there's anything more specific you can say than that in general. 

Ben gave the general answer above. If you care specifically about the symplectic group and are interested in a "flag-like" description of its flag variety, then one exists. It is given by all half-flags of isotropic subspaces (this is just like for $SL_n$, the symplectic group acts transitively and the stabilizer of the standard half-flag will be the standard Borel). With this description, it's just as straightforward computing Springer fibers and the like as it is for the $SL_n$ case, which you're presumably familiar with. A reference for these flag-like descriptions can be found in the section of Fulton and Harris on "Homogeneous Spaces" (there's a similar description for the special orthogonal groups). 

Your confusion seems to stem from the difference between topological bundles and algebraic/holomorphic bundles. For a scheme $(X, \mathcal{O}_X),$ you say that $H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X^{\times})$ classifies line bundles on $X$. This is true, as long as you mean algebraic line bundles. If, for example, $X$ is something like a complex algebraic variety with the analytic topology (which seems to be how you're thinking about it, perhaps), then there can certainly be plenty of topological line bundles on $X$ which aren't algebraic. Also, as Lucas Culler notes in the comments to your question, a line bundle is not a torsor under the additive group $\mathbb{C}$. Instead, it is actually a $\mathbb{C}^{\times}$ torsor, if you remove the zero section. Algebraically, a torsor for the additive group $\mathbb{C}$ (which, by the way, is often denoted $\mathbb{G}_a$ to avoid confusion) is classified by all extensions of $\mathcal{O}_X$ by $\mathcal{O}_X$. Anyway, it is true that (maybe with some mild assumptions on your space $X$) that $H^1(X,G)$ classifies topological $G$-bundles on $X$.

So, let's say we have a symplectic variety over $\mathbb{C}$, $M$, of dimension $2n$, and $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ Poisson commuting functions with $df_1\wedge\ldots\wedge df_n$ generically nonzero. Further assume that the fibers of the map $f:M\to\mathbb{C}^n$ determined by the $f_i$ is an open subset of an abelian variety and the vector fields $X_{f_i}$ are linear. We call such a thing an algebraically completely integrable Hamiltonian system. Now, I'm told that there's a definition of integrable system in PDEs that acts as some sort of stability condition, though I don't understand it. I've also been told that there's a way to, from an integrable system of PDEs, construct an integrable Hamiltonian system (just drop the condition that fibers be in abelian varieties), and that these two types of objects should be equivalent. My questions: 1) What's the correct formulation for PDEs to make something like this work out? (I know virtually nothing about PDEs, and would be quite grateful just to be pointed at a good reference, if there's too much I need to read to get a quick, understandable answer) 2) Is there a general method of going from an algebraically completely integrable Hamiltonian system, which is algebro-geometric in nature to working out the PDEs explicitly? Does it help if the symplectic variety is known to be the cotangent bundle of something? How about if the base is unirational? rational? 

(second edit: This second bullet point is still incorrect. See David Speyer's comments and Tyler Lawson's answer for a correct formulation.) 

I'm not sure how to answer the question about intuition. In regards to your second question, the Tannakian formalism works over any field and in fact works for more general categories than Rep(G). A category C is called a neutral Tannakian category over k (k a field) if it is a rigid abelian tensor category together with a k-linear tensor exact functor from C to k-Vect. This latter functor is known as the fiber functor (and is just the forgetful functor referenced in the original post when C = Rep(G)). In this case, there's a theorem that says any neutral Tannakian category is equivalent to the category of representations of an affine group scheme G, where G is given by the tensor automorphisms of the fiber functor. One of the original references for this is a 1982 paper by Deligne and Milne titled 'Tannkian Categories.' Deligne also has an article in the more recent FGA explained. My understanding is that sometimes k can even be replaced by an arbitrary commutative ring. I don't know general conditions under which this holds. However, a great example of the Tannakian formalism in action where k is a general commutative ring is the Mirkovic-Vilonen paper on the geometric Satake correspondence, which they prove in great generality (Ginzburg also has a nice paper on this topic, but only in characteristic zero). The Mirkovic-Vilonen paper can be found here $URL$ In this paper, they prove that their fiber functor is represented by a k-module which is free over k (k any commutative ring here) and hence the Tannakian formalism still works. I don't know if this condition is also a necessary condition. There's also a version of the Tannakian formalism over a scheme, so to speak. If we view a group G as a principal G-bundle on a point and the category of vector spaces as the category of vector bundles on a point, then we can try to generalize to a scheme. Namely, if we fix a G-bundle on a scheme X, then this induces an exact tensor functor from Rep(G) to the category of vector bundles on X using the associated bundle construction. It turns out that the converse holds: given an exact tensor functor from Rep(G) to vector bundles on X, this is equivalent to giving a G-bundle on X. There's a proof of this fact in a set of notes on the webpage for the seminar that Dennis Gaitsgory is currently running. 

To me, the canonical example is the Poincare Conjecture. Why SHOULD a three dimensional manifold with trivial fundamental group actually be the sphere? In higher dimensions, there are LOTS of simply connected things, but in two and three, simply connected and compact manifold determines the manifold uniquely. 

HYYY, the answer is a qualified "yes." I'm not an expert (read a few papers at the beginning of the year before deciding that enumerative geometry wasn't going to be my area) and I know that the answer is a definitive yes for rational curves in homogeneous spaces. However, more generally than that, the Kontsevich moduli space of stable maps isn't a manifold, but merely an orbifold, and so has rational cohomology but not integral. So you get rational numbers. Worse, if your curves aren't rigid, they might count negatively, so there will be rational and negative Gromov-Witten invariants, in general. This paper is a great introduction, and works out the first big theorem that GW invariants proved, in a case where they do, in fact, count curves.

The Dynkin diagram enter as follows. Each of these surfaces can be resolved through a finite number of blow-ups, and the exceptional fiber in the resolution will consist of a copy of $\mathbb{P}^1$ for each node of the Dynkin diagram, each of which is joined to the point of another $\mathbb{P}^1$ if there is a corresponding edge in the Dynkin diagram connecting the two nodes (so in the cyclic case, it's just a chain of $\mathbb{P}^1$'s). Lastly, there is a neat connection between this and Springer theory that goes as follows. Let $\mathcal{N}$ denote the nilpotent cone of a Lie algebra of one of the types listed above, and let $\mathcal{O}$ denote the subregular orbit. Then $\mathcal{O}$ has codimension two in $\mathcal{N}$ and hence the corresponding Kostant/Slodowy slice is a surface in $\mathcal{N}.$ It then turns out that this surface is one of the surface singularities listed above, and that the corresponding Springer fiber of a subregular element is isomorphic to the exceptional fiber in the resolution of the surface mentioned above. So the Springer resolution encodes the information of the successive blow-ups of these surfaces.

Let $X$ be a quasi-projective variety. Suppose that we (perhaps partially, if either enough is known) compactify to $\bar{X}$ with $\bar{X}\setminus X=D$ is a divisor. Say that we know the canonical bundle $K_X$. Then $K_{\bar{X}}=K_X+nD$ for some $n$. 

Isn't that the only one of length two? And for length three, shouldn't $\mathbb{F}_q[x,y]/(x^2,xy,y^2)$ work? I believe (possibly incorrectly) that here length and dimension over the base field agree. 

Let $X$ be a (irreducible) variety (over $\mathbb{C}$ if necessary, smooth orbifold if necessary), and $U\subset X$ a nonempty open subset, and let $G$ be a finite group with an algebraic action on $U$. When does the action extend to an action of $G$ on $X$? Are there any conditions that are reasonable to verify, as I'd prefer to avoid having to construct the action on $X\setminus U$ (I know the action exists for other reasons, but the method I'm using gives easily that I have an action on a nonempty open, rather than the whole thing) 

Up to projectivities, there are uncountably many configurations. Let's do the naive dimension count: The Grassmannian of lines in $\mathbb{P}^3$ is four dimensional, so the parameter space for four lines is 16 dimensional. The automorphism group of $\mathbb{P}^3$, the projections, is made up of four by four matrices modulo the diagonal matrices, so is dimension 16-1=15. So we should get a whole curve worth of possible configurations. This is analagous to how you can use cross ratio to distinguish different configurations of four points in $\mathbb{P}^1$. EDIT: To make this more general and distinguish it from jvp's comment, if you look at $n+1$ lines in $\mathbb{P}^n$, then you have $(n+1)^2-1=n^2+2n$ automorphisms, and the space of lines is $2(n-1)$ dimensional, so in general you have $2(n-1)(n+1)-(n+1)^2+1$ dimensions worth of configurations, and this simplifies to $n^2-2n-2$. 

You can use connectedness to prove that $\mathbb{R}$ is not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ for any n>1 by noting that $\mathbb{R} \backslash 0$ is not connected while $\mathbb{R}^n \backslash 0$ is connected. The students may not be very impressed by this as it is telling them something they probably already assumed was true. I suppose that if you wanted them to discover cohomology, you could challenge them to find a reason why Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are never homeomorphic (I realize that this probably isn't very reasonable). 

This is merely too long to be a comment. I'm not sure that I completely agree with or understand the basis of the question. Is this one of those questions where the OP is taking for granted that varieties are interesting and then wondering what schemes are useful for in this context? If so, there have certainly been other questions of this sort on mathoverflow. However, I get the feeling this is not what's being asked for, in which case I'm not sure that the example of character theory being used to solve a problem of group theory is completely analogous. In that example, groups are already inherently part of character theory, so it seems reasonable that problems of group theory might be attacked using character theory. When asking a similar question about schemes, I'm not sure what the starting point is. To me, asking what you can do with schemes is more like asking 'what can you do with groups?' than 'what can you do with characters?'. At this point, I would say that both groups and schemes are naturally occurring basic mathematical objects that are of great interest to many mathematicians. 

I've been reading about D-modules, and have seen a proof that D_X, the ring of differential operators on a variety, is "almost commutative", that is, that its associated graded ring is commutative. Now, I know that with the Ore conditions, we can localize almost commutative rings, and so we get a legitimate sheaf D to do geometry with. But how far does the analogy go? What theorems are true for commutative rings but can't be modified reasonably to be true for (nice, say, left and right noetherian or somesuch) almost commutative rings? 

Depending on what you mean, then no. Elliptic curves (abstractly) are in bijection with lattices modulo homothety (also, the upper half plane modulo SL(2,Z)). As for the Lie algebra of an elliptic curve, an elliptic curve is abelian, so the lie algebra is a one dimensional abelian complex Lie algebra, so it has trivial bracket. 

Though I don't have enough details to really write it out here, you'll be wanting to look at Mumford's "On the Equations Defining Abelian Varieties I, II, III", which are in volume I of his selected papers (as well as his website at the links provided), and also the wikipedia page here. 

Let G be an algebraic group (or, since the question was tagged as differential geometry, a Lie group). Then if we're given a principal G-bundle $E_G$ and a representation V of G, we get a vector bundle out of this through the associated bundle construction: $(E_G \times V)/G$ is a vector bundle with generic fiber V. Here, G acts on $E_G \times V$ as $g(x,v) = (xg^{-1},gv).$ This shows that fixing a G-bundle determines an exact tensor functor from the category of representations of G to the category of vector bundles. There's a converse to this which says that giving an exact tensor functor from representations of G to vector bundles is equivalent to a G-bundle. 

No, a ring will always be free viewed as a module over itself, but its ideals certainly don't have to be free. For example, consider the ring $R = k[t]/t^2$ and consider the submodule $I = (t),$ the ideal generated by $t$. Then $R \to I$ by multiplication by $t$ and has kernel $I$. It's then easy to see that $\ldots \to R \to R \to I \to 0$ is an infinite free resolution of $I$ where each map is multiplication by $t$. 

Well, in this paper, there seems to be a definition for curves with nodes. It seems to go like this: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a torsion free sheaf of rank $r$, then at each node $x_i$, there's a decomposition $\mathcal{F}_{x_1}=\mathcal{O}_{x_i}^{a_i}\oplus\mathfrak{m}_{x_i}^{r-a_i}$. At each point, we also get a map $\mathcal{F}_{x_i}\to k(x_i)^{a_i}$, and so we get $$0\to\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{F}\to\oplus_{x_i} k(x_i)^{a_i}\to 0$$. Then, there's a vector bundle $E$ on the resolution, and we get the formula $\deg\mathcal{F}(=c_1)=\deg E-nr+\sum a_i$ where $n$ is the number of nodes. Admittedly, this is a bit awkward, and only works in the case of nodes, but it seems a place to start...I don't know how much of this still remains true for planar singularities, or how the formulas would change. 

For $d=q-1$, let $f$ be a polynomial vanishing at all points of $\mathbb F_q$ except $0$. Let $f_1$ $f_2$ such that $f_1+f_2=f$, and define $A$ such that $A(f_1)=1$ and $A(f_2)=-1$ and $A(g)=0$ for all other $g$. Then, the only terms surviving are $$A(f_1)A(f_2)\phi(f_1+f_2)+A(f_2)A(f_1)\phi(f_2+f_1)+A(f_1)^2\phi(2f_1)+A(f_2)^2\phi(2f_2).$$ Then, we can compute the value to be $$-\phi(f)+-\phi(f)+\phi(0)+\phi(0)=-(q-1)+-(q-1)+q+q=2.$$ Now, I can't prove that this is minimal, but this does show that $q$ isn't minimal for all $d$. I'll edit this answer if I come up with anything for the $\frac{q}{2}-1$ case. EDIT: Whenever 2 can be achieved, it is minimal, because the value must be an even number. The summation breaks up to $\sum_{f\neq g} A(f)A(g)\phi(f+g)+\sum_f A(f)^2\phi(2f)$. The latter is a multiple of $q$, which is even, so it suffices to show that the first sum is even. For all $f,g$, we get two terms, $A(f)A(g)\phi(f+g)$ and $A(g)A(f)\phi(f+g)$ that are equal, and, being equal integers, their sum is even. Every term in the first sum is of this form, and so the first sum must be even. So we have a sum of even integers, so the minimal number must be even, so the example above shows that 2 is minimal for $d=q-1$. In fact, it shows that 2 is minimal for $d\geq q-1$, by just throwing in extra copies of the fact $x-1$. Still haven't worked it out for $d$ less than $q-1$, but there's a proof for large $d$. Edit 2: In fact, the same line of argument shows that for $d$ less than $q$, we can bound above by $2(q-d)$, so for $d=q/2-1$, we can bound above by $2q-2(q/2-1)=2q-q+2=q+2$, don't yet know if this is sharp.
