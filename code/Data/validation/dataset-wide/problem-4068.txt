Consider the finite map $\mathbb{A}^1_\mathbb{Q}\rightarrow \mathbb{A}^1_\mathbb{Q}$ given by $z\mapsto z^5-z$. The fiber over generic point is the field extension $\mathbb{Q}(t)[z]/(z^5-z-t)$ over $\mathbb{Q(t)}$ whose normalization has Galois group equal to the full symmetric group $ S_5 $ (can prove this by tensoring with $\mathbb{C}$ and calculating the monodromy action - but how to obtain this is unimportant for the question). What I want to know is, can we use this information about the generic point to deduce anything about the analogous Galois group at closed points whose fiber is a field extension? (I don't expect a statement at all such points, just something about some of them - see the motivation below) If the answer is positive, is there a generalization to arbitrary finite morphisms of curves or of varieties? I am thinking about this problem after spending some time trying to ferret out the exact difference between what is given by two different proofs of the insolubility of the quintic - the first by demonstrating that the Galois group of $z^5 - z - 1$ (or any other specific quintic over $\mathbb{Q}$) is the full $S_5$, the second by demonstrating that the "generic" quintic, i.e. the quintic with indeterminate coefficients has Galois group the full $S_5$ over the field obtained by adjoining its symmetric polynomials to $\mathbb{Q}$. In particular, I am interested to know if you can deduce that this fact must hold for some polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$ from the fact that it holds for the "generic" polynomial (it is less interesting to me that it holds for independent complex transcendentals over $\mathbb{Q}$, even though this is enough to deduce that there is no "quintic formula" for quintics with complex coefficients). Any answers, references, or comments on either the problem posed or the motivation given would be highly appreciated! Thanks. 

I'm looking for an explanation of the following result: If D is a maximal order in a definite (i.e. ramified at infinity) quaternion algebra B over $\mathbb{Q}$, and $\phi : B\otimes\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{H}$ is an isomorphism over $\mathbb{R}$ (where $\mathbb{H}$ is the Hamiltonian quaternions over $\mathbb{R}$), then the co-volume of $\phi(D)$ in $\mathbb{H}$ (with respect to the Lebesgue measure for the basis 1,i,j,k) is $(1/4) \cdot Disc(D)$ (where the discriminant is the determinant of the trace form on a basis of $D$, or, equivalently since $D$ is maximal, the product of the finite primes where $B$ ramifies). Right now the only way I have to see this is through an explicit calculation using the generators for maximal orders described in a paper by Ibukiyama available here: $URL$ , but I feel like there must be a nice way to see this using just properties of maximal orders without having to calculate with an explicit basis. Any ideas or references? 

In short: D is hyperbolic, C is parabolic (this is very vague, I know; there is at least one thing that makes me uneasy about all this presentation of things: that C nevertheless contains D.). Now, anytime you have an island, you have a patch that is a copy of the domain D$_i$. If you start from a point in the domain, mapped in D$_i$, and try to lift D$_i$ by f and hit a problem, is may be because you need to put a ramification point, so this increases the number of patches you need... kind of... in fact you will probalbyhave to cut your patch into smaller pieces, because of more ramification points: but then the heuristics is that it only improves things (it makes dom(f) more hyperbolic). If the problem is not due to a ramification point, then it there is an asymptotic value, and again this leads to many patches: in some sense, it is even more hyperbolic than just having ramification points. If $f$ is transcendental and some D$_i$ has only finitely many islands, then close enough to the boundary of dom(f), it is a bit like there is no islands. By the discussion above other preimages will be ramified, or worse. Now if there are enough D$_i$ with this property, then the game is to see that, on a purely combinatorial level, there must at least an exponential growth of the patches (this is idealistic but this gives an idea): this is what happens with the two examples above. Let us look at an example that works not: cos(z). Its critical points are points of $\pi\mathbb Z$, half of which get mapped to -1 the other half to 1. There is no asymptotic value (in fact, infinity is). The number of patches (whatever that means) grows linearly with the combinatorial distance. More precisely if you take D$_1$ and D$_2$ two disks about -1 and 1, their preimages are all ramified of ramification number=2. Join them by a line. Then the preimage of this picture is many disks-like domains at all the points of $\pi\mathbb Z$ all joined to the next by a line. This graph is more "euclidean" than "hyperbolic". Now if you have three domains D$_i$, take a point outside and link this point to each D$_i$ by disjoint curves, giving a Y-shaped picture with three disks attached at the tips. Ideally, the preimage of this graph contains (infinitely) many copies of this Y-shaped curve with disks at tips and to each of these disk (with finitely many exceptions) is attached at least two distinct copies of a Y. Such a graph is necessarily hyperbolic. Again, I do not know the proof of Ahlfors' theorems, and I completely forgot the proof of Bloch's theorem, so all this may be far from the actual proofs. This is just my point of view on things. 

Here $1\times d^s: \Delta^{n-1}\cong\Delta^{n-1}\times\Delta^{0}\rightarrow\Delta^{n-1}\times\Delta^{1}, s=0, 1$ are the inclusions of the endpoints of the standard 1-simplex; and the maps $d^i, d^j:\Delta^{n-1}\rightarrow\Delta^{n}$ are also the coface maps. Drawing a picture, I think $\Delta^{n}$ should be a quotient of the prism $\Delta^{n-1}\times\Delta^{1}$, possibly by collapsing some non-degenerate n-simplices except only one of them, to a point, but I can't make this intuition rigorous. Could you make this precise? In fact, I want to define a notion of path components of a Kan complex. In the literature, I only find the definition of $\pi_0$, which only involves the 0-simplices. I want to define path components of a Kan complex, all of which should then also be a (connected) Kan complex. If you can make sense of this without proving the above result, it would also be very helpful. 

$\require{AMScd}$ Let $M$ be a pointed model category, consider a commutative square $$ \begin{CD} X' @> f' >> Y'\\ @Vu_0VV @VVu_1V \\ X @>> f > Y, \end{CD} $$ taking the homotopy cofiber of the four maps give a diagram as follows $$ \begin{CD} X' @> f' >> Y'@> g' >> C'\\ @Vu_0VV @VVu_1V @VVu_2V\\ X @>> f > Y@>> g > C\\ @Vv_0VV @VVv_1V\\ X'' @> f'' >> Y'', \end{CD} $$ taking further the homotopy cofiber of $f''$ gives a commutative diagram like this: $$ \begin{CD} X' @> f' >> Y'@> g' >> C'\\ @Vu_0VV @VVu_1V @VVu_2V\\ X @>> f > Y@>> g > C\\ @Vv_0VV @VVv_1V @VVv_2V\\ X'' @> f'' >> Y''@> g'' >> C''. \end{CD} $$ My question is 

Let $f:A\rightarrow B, g:B\rightarrow C$ be maps in the category CGWH (compactly generated weakly Hausdorff spaces). Do we have a homotopy fibration sequence $$F(f)\rightarrow F(gf) \rightarrow F(g)$$ consisting of homotopy fibres? (And the dual statement for homotopy cofibres?) 

It's intuitively clear that any two faces of the standard simplex are homotopic, more formally, for any $0\le i<j\le n$, there should be a (surjective) map in the category of simplicial sets, 

Let $X, Y$ be schemes, $Z, Z'$ closed subschemes of $X, Y$ respectively. Assume there is an isomorphism $f: Z\to Z'$, is it possible to find open neighborhoods $U, V$ of $Z, Z'$ respectively such that there is an isomorphism $F: U\to V$ extending $f$? Or under what mild condition such an extension always exists? I guess we need to assume that $X, Y$ are regular schemes and the inclusion of $Z, Z'$ are regular immersions. In that case it's easily reduced to the case when $Y$ is the total space of the normal bundle $N_{Z/X}$ of $Z$ in $X$ and $Z'$ being the zero section. And then the result would be something like the tubular neighborhood theorem in differential topology. But I can't prove such a tubular neighborhood theorem for (regular closed immersion of) schemes.
