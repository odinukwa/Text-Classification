When you start off you can keep contemplating on the virtues and adhere to them. If any is broken make a strong determination not to break it again. As you progress look at the sensation each volition creates. If then sensation is gross then the action that follows will also be a gross action (breaking a virtue) hence should be avoided. Repenting is not productive. At higher stages you will notice that repenting also causes gross sensations, but until then keep in mind that repenting aggravates the Karma. 

You can call yourself a Buddhist if you give fair trial to the Buddhist teaching. You should have some faith the the Buddha, the Community and the Teaching unless you will not try the Dhamma. Buddhism is not a religion in the sense that a religion accepts a higher power. 

Yes of course. But for starters the Middle Length Discourse may be more bite sized than the Long Disclosure. 

Buddhist ethics is the basis to develop wisdom and mastery over the mind. If there are no unwholesome Karmic results you cannot collect your mind to develop concentration as wholesome results give present experiences than unpleasant which is more distracting in meditation. In the above case through you can argue that you remote form of indirectly kill in buying meat you do not create the type unwholesome roots associated with killing in the mind which results in unpleasant experiences later. Making others kills which has Karmic repercussion would be instead of you killing you order someone else to kill or bring hims to such a state that he will kill intending that he would kill. Leaving aside killing, if you take ethics too far then you cannot live. E.g. your food and drinks do have microbes. Antibiotics kill microbes. I have heard once a monk with supernormal powers, after filtering water, saw that there were beings too small to be seen by the naked eye still in the water hence if you are strictly not to harm the you cannot ever eat or drink. The advice received was do not use your Jhanic powers to see if there are microbes in the water. If you are vegetarian well and good, but if you are not, this is not a hindrance to develop mastery over the mind or wisdom and such action does not have karmic repercussions. 

In summary it is consciousness and reactive / reflexive sensation that arises 1st followed by (visual) clarity of the object by filling in the details when you perceive or cognise it. In addition see: five aggregates 

You should meditate as much as possible. I session is ideally 1 hour. Having said this, the best way to do this is by strong resolution. You make a strong resolution as I will to this for 15 minutes. As you go on you will notice that the time you take is as much as you make the resolution. But be realistic when you start doing this. 

A surgeon takes a knife and cuts through a person's stomach to save his life A robber takes a knife and cuts through a person's stomach kill him and take his belongings 

If you choose to see things as they are or investigate the Dhamma. Since in the 8th Jhana there is a residue of Perception and Feeling hence you should direct your observation to understand the impermanence of feeling or impermanence of what is felt if you what to develop insight into the 3 marks of existance. A person taking the Arupa Jhana route attains the final goal by going though Nirodha Samapathi () See: Raho,gata Sutta for further details. 

This is through teacher and student lineages through though the years some changes have occurred. Early on the Dhamma was also preserved this way through oral tradition handed down from teacher to pupil. One of the best preserved lineages is that handed down from Ledi Sayadaw which has teachers like: Saya Gyi U Ba Khin, S. N. Goenka. It is believed that this is the exact teaching transmitted to Burma through Sona and Uttara. This probably would have the best resemblance to that was taught at Māhāvihāra early on. 

Are some of the Suttas we have today different from the original Suttas as taught by the Buddha? Are there any surviving pre sectarian Buddhist sources and commentaries? What research has been done on pre sectarian Suttas? 

Late Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero is known to have taken the Bodhisattva vows and aspiring towards Buddhahood in a future life. So is Nauyane Ariyadhamma Mahathera. So yes you can meet aspirants through many may not say so. 

The essence of Enlightenment, in short, is to be stress free. This is by understanding the 4 Noble Truths and attaining Nirvana, which is realised through the Noble 8 Fold Path organised into the 3 Fold Training, which essentially is the path out of stress and misery, or the path to Nirvana. 

As most religions also must be preaching to be established in morality and ethics. Also no to be impulsive and do bad due to this. Also no religion can be against gaining wisdom. Hence I think a Christian can practice Buddhism. Anyone practicing any religion can practice buddhism as I do not see any incompatibility. 

Does anyone have a comprehensive side by side reference to Suttas numbering from different edition (PTS, VRI, etc.) of the Tripitaka? I have trouble with reconciliation of certain references to the Sutta names. 

It you experience something unpleasant this could partly be due to bad karma. If you experience something positive this can be good karma. Deciding on your experiences you can see what type of Karma is effective. Regardless of you being in a positive or negative situation, you have make sure your future is bright, i.e., moving from dark to bright or from bright to brights. You cannot do anything about your current situation but you can do something about the future. 

One main aspect of Buddhism is to deal with reality as it is. Also sensations (Vedananupassana) is a main aspect your meditation. So you are taking the bull by the horns when dealing with pain. So when practicing Buddhism you do not by passing it. 

accept the fact everyone must die and let go of the fear of death not procrastinate meditation to develop wisdom make your mind equanimous as possible to handle the pain of death so you do not lose the balance and get re born in a lower realm 

... Also note: Unwholesome Vitakka/Vicara is generally Papanca but this leads to be scatterbrain than concentrated. Also leading to Restless Worry. This does not result in any Jhana. Also Papanca is obsessed with a thought. If a memory or thought comes and you do not keep thinking along the initial thought it is not Papanca. If you continue thinking from the initial though then it is Papanca. When you say Papanca aimless string of thoughts. If you maintain wise attention then thinking and planning will not be unwholesome. Also see: What is Papañca? BY ANDREW OLENDZKI 

If you are leading a householders life you cannot avoid these always. But your per suits should be fruitful for either: 

And not being attached to sensation (pleasant, unpleasant) that arise with it. Getting attached to this gives rise to craving and clinging. See: Twelve Nidānas This is does not mean you should not care about others but care for all as your would care for your self without clining to others. Also looking at it in the larger context would make it easier to understand: 

There are infinite beings in a universe. Event if a large number of beings become enlightened then still there will be infinite beings. The number of beings in all planes who get enlightened is approximately 24 asankya. The number of past Buddhas is infinite, the number of Arahants are infinite as there were infinite Sasanas. But despite all who becomes arahants infinite being remain, of whom some maybe born in this world. 

Intention does not matter if it is hard to keep track of initially. Just concentrate on the sensations that arise. Sometimes when you cannot fix a piece of code or perhaps under pressure then these situations also give sensations. Be mindful of them. 

Best is to handle it with Equanimity and Metha. When such an incident happens examine your self to see if you have lost the balance of your mind. In which case you would be having unpleasant sensation in your body and mind and your breath would loose regularity and become longer. If this is the case concentrate on the breath and / or sensation until the breath becomes short and the sensation become pleasant and / or neutral. When you reach this state you regained the balance of your mind. Then you can think clearly and take an action which is proactive opposed to being reactive. Also you can develop Metha towards the person also before any action. 

And not being blunt though trueful. In this cases you can be very tactful like answering question like was the food good, etc. 

This interferes with your mindfulness. So best is to sop using them. If it is difficult perhaps you can use professional help. This might also help in solving your changed circumstances. 

Nama rupa is one and the same as the 5 Aggregates, hence the relationship of nama rupa holds for the 5 Aggregates. 

I believe this is no needed to modernise Buddhism. Ani Sutta makes references to how the Dhamma may end where disciples tend to study the later works than the original teaching. Also see The Dharma-ending Age wich highlights how the Dhamma may end. 

Discriminant is wisdom. You try to see things clearly or as they are, especially uncluttered by perception. (See introduction of Discernment: The Buddha’s Strategies for Happiness II) Perception is your outlook of the world or mind map of the world. Perception clouds seeing things as they are hence the relationship. 

Vimanavatthu and Petavatthu was preached to make people understand reciprocation of Karma hence behave themselves. This also is not to keep someone tied to believe in the teaching. Also I do not believe this was added later. 

Buddhism having so many different schools and lineages this maybe open to interpretation. But no there is no concept of non interference in Buddhism. General take on the matter regarding action is that you should act proactively than reactively, i.e., your actions should not be a reaction of clinging and craving towards sensations, and your actions should be devoid of delusion, agreed and aversion. Also you should be rightly motivated (non deluded state of mind, generous and comparisonate) when doing the action. You should not be attached to the outcome as you are not in absolute control over how it would materialise. Also general tendency in taking action and interference is that you take sides where you have compassion towards one person and not the other. This should not be the case. If you see someone doing something wrong to another you have to have equal or more comparison to the offending party as he is creating bad Karma through ignorance. Your motivation should be able help the victim and save the would be offender from his Karma or at least help reduce it. In mediation this should be the right motivation. Rather than non action or interference you should act with the right volition and state of mind without attachments to the results. For further information see: 

(Magga) Vibhaṅga Sutta To simplify it a bit more, the key is which appears in each instance. This is by being equanimous and knowing impedance. E.g. If you take the body and sub section of posture. Some postures may be comfortable, neutral or painful. You just have to maintain equanimity and see the impermanence of the sensations.[Pacalā Sutta, Dīgha,nakha Sutta, Pahāna Sutta] 

Mathematics, science, logic fall to the field of perception. If you conceptualize things and hold on to them as reality then this can be a hindrance. You have to try to see things as they are without the clouding of perception. Initially perceptions will be strong, but when perceptions arise you should try to be equanimous without clinging or reacting to the sensations associated with the perception and it's trigger. With this your perception weakens, and ultimately when you realize some form of sainthood, it ceases momentarily. 

Realising that thoughts arisen itself sometimes bring you mind back. If not 1st be aware of the through and breath. Then look for any sensation that the thoughts might have brought, e.g. discomfort if they were angry thoughts. Finally actively redirect you mind to the chosen object. 

External help like apps can be a hindrance when you get to rely on them. Even guided meditation instructions can become as you get used to them. The issue with habits is that most of the action is not strictly mindful. Having said this much of the standard advice is to systematically bring your attention to a chosen object and then to continuously keep re targeting this object, while continuously reviewing if your attention is with the object. This is like 1st looking at the object and then looking under a magnifying glass, or taking aim and shooting with a machine-gun to the object. When you practice this your mind will stay with the object. After sometime this will become pleasant also. Also this will increase your concentration. Ideally this redirection should be aimed at the 4 foundations of mindfulness or Metta, Muditha, Karuna and Upekka. 

Life expectancy (Ayu-Kalpa) changes, but not related to any individual's progress. This is related to the whole society itself. 

You need the eye faculty to see. In Humans and animals you have a physical eye made of gross material. In finer material spheres you will have eyes with finer material. Only in immaterial realms you will be without sense faculties. In finer material realm your sense faculties are finer / shapere than being gross faculties. This is why in super normal powers this one of the power is know are divine [godly/heavenly] eye. In all realms you have the 6 faculties in some for or the other except in the immaterial realms where you do not have the physical faculties. Being in some finer material realm (heavens and hells) can see people in our realm and perhaps other realms also. Perhaps in other realms also there might be being without an eye faculty like the blind in our realm. I don't this there being would be able to see.
