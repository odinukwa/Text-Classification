Disclaimer: I am a student and not a scholar of Plato at this point. I started reading his works in the order of the canon of Thrasyllus and only just finished Pheado myself. According to G.M.A. Grube's introduction to Pheado the myth at the end ought to be compared to the ones in: 

There is also a very real social justice consideration: the people most likely to need to sell organs are also the most likely to need to remain healthy. The simplest way to get at the concern is to ask yourself how much it would take to sell, for instance, one of your kidneys. Would $10,000 be enough to give up a vital organ that you may want to hold onto for your later years? What about $1 million? If you are very poor, the first number would be tempting because it represents a large percentage of their yearly income. But I don't think the second number would interest me at all. It's the poor of the world (and it's quite likely you, the reader, are quite rich relative to the entire world's population) who have the hardest time remaining healthy. And health is a much bigger factor in the earning power of the poor. Again, this consideration might not be a problem in light of the benefits of a used organ market, but you can't just dismiss them either. 

As someone who has heard, approved and used the phrase in the second sense, I'll take a stab at justifying myself. First, I'm grateful to Cerberus' answer, which besides saving me a lot of time, is exceptionally good. In addition, it includes the context which shows that Voltaire himself borrowed the idea from an even more removed source. Now it seems to me that Voltaire is either expanding on the sentiment expressed by the Italian sage, or reinterpreting it. (I don't think we can tell which unless we find the original.) In either case, what we read here is in itself a form of reader-response criticism. If I read it correctly, the poem seems to set wisdom, morality1, talents and knowledge2 apart from other pursuits when it comes to selecting the "better" or the "good". In turn that would mean that the good in those fields might prevent us from striving for the better, but the hope of the better in other areas of life might prevent us from enjoying the good. Could it not therefore be taken in either sense depending on where it is applied? In terms of the propriety of reader-response criticism and if it will lead to madness, I think it depends on whether you've first taken seriously the task of understanding the author's original intent. Madness would result from using the reader's interpretation as a shortcut to skip the step of really understanding a text. Ignoring the reader and their response to at text is a different form of madness. 

ἰδέα would have been an even stronger callback to Plato, which may be why Paul didn't use it. God becoming man is equally nonsensical to Jewish thought, but for very different reasons. Vinko Vrsalovic suggested about this paragraph that it's the same or equivalent to "It is inconsistent as seen from a logical framework." to quote Lennart Regebro's answer. I disagree. Consider this example: I have the power to jump off a high building, cut my wrists and crash my car into a wall at 100 MPH. But I don't do these things because I chose not to. Or suppose I had the ability to tread water forever. That doesn't mean I must always demonstrate that power. Or to put things another way, God has the power to break the rules of logic, but for whatever reason doesn't. Whatever his purposes may be, they do not include the need to make a stone he cannot move. 

Neither of these arguments are cogent on their own since reasonable people can draw clear lines between one situation and another. Is a fetus a part of the woman's body or is it an independent human? The lines are fuzzy, so it sort of depends on where you start. Neither argument is particularly persuasive for people who make different assumptions or have different ethical priorities. A semantic slippery slope argument could be cogent, but it's also a red flag that there might be something fishy going on under the surface. 

To reformulate the question so that I know for sure1 what you are asking: "Sometimes religious experiences are a result of delusions, so we can't say that such experiences justify religious belief. Even so, might certain religious beliefs be true?" Obviously, the answer to that is "yes", since there are many things that are true but which we lack justified, true belief. For instance, someone will win a lottery in the near future despite many people believing they will win and none of them being justified. Further there are people who have convinced themselves that they do have justification because they've developed a system or received the numbers in a dream or whatever. At some point, one of those people might win the lottery and turn out to have true belief justified by whatever evidence they suppose they have.2 But you also ask whether religious knowledge can be persuasive based on religious experiences, which is a separate and trickier question. In the lottery case, few people would accept that some knowledge of future lottery results is justified. Even if someone really was justified in believing they knew future lottery numbers (by bribing the person who picks the numbers to somehow manipulate the results or inventing time travel), consider the difficulty involved in persuading someone else they have such knowledge. Only the most gullible would believe such a claim.3 There are just too many cases where something too good to be true is for most of us to take such extraordinary claims at face value no matter what the evidence. However, I wonder if your assumption that recent research has shown religious experiences to be unreliable holds. Polling data shows that, at least in the US, equal numbers of people report having "Religious and Mystical Experiences" and not having them. Global polls would likely show that most people have had those sorts of experiences. And history suggests that these sorts of experiences are overwhelmingly normal for humans. Extrapolating a bit, they seem least common among populations that have taken an a priori position against the possibility of such experiences. Confirmation bias would suggest that in those populations, evidence for such experiences is ignored and evidence against is highlighted. Now it's certainly possible that more enlightened populations are justified in dismissing religious experiences, but starting with the position that they are not reliable evidence would be a form of begging the question. 

I found a throw-away critique of Kurt Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem in an essay about Deconstruction: 

So the orthodox Christian belief is that God did interfere with humanity at least once in human history. 

Ruben made an excellent comment below asking about some features of the Moral Foundations Theory. I should start by pointing out that it is still a work in progress as the authors are considering new principles and realigning the existing ones. There have been several suggestions that may expand the range of foundations to cover more systems of human morality. I'd say that for the Aztecs, 3, 4, and 5 (hallmarks of sacrificial systems of worship) so outweigh 1 and 2 that sacrifice of outsiders is seen as virtuous. The victims (as I remember from history and anthropology classes) were usually captured enemies and the sacrifices symbolized the Aztec dominance over its portion of the world. In addition, excellence in battle was highly prized and being captured would be shameful, so killing captives could be seen as a sign of mercy in a twisted way. More difficult is child sacrifice found in the ancient near east, which seems to violate family loyalty. That practice probably arose from total dominance of the "Respect" principle for particularly brutal gods. It could also arise from loyalty to the nation rather than family as it was sometimes performed by kings killing their own sons in times of national distress. (See 2 Kings 3:27.) Further, it could be that child sacrifice arose not from faulty morality, but from faulty science: if you believe that famine comes because a god demands sacrifice, you could believe that voluntarily sacrificing a small number of people could save a great many more by preventing famine. The deeper issue is whether different weights represent different moral frameworks. I'd say that they do. Anyone finding themselves considering child sacrifice, can be confident that they've got their priorities wrong somehow. Anyone defending an action on the basis of someone else not really being human in some way, should know they've mis-weighted their moral system along the line. Aristotle would likely suggest that weighting any morale foundation much heavier than another is itself an immoral choice. The graveyard of rejected moral systems would be filled with extreme weights like purity 1000 times more important than fairness. Moral Foundations Theory has the virtue of giving us a meta-framework that can help us understand distant cultures and analyze their moral systems. How the Aztec system arose is not an easy question, but how they went wrong morally is almost trivial if you consider the equal weighting of moral foundations an ideal system. 

If the simulation trilemma is correct, it is also trivial Reading through the Bostrom paper the first time, I missed his definition of "posthuman". Thankfully, the term is defined: 

Many of the paradoxes above arise from taking an idea out of context and trying to fit it into a belief system where it does not fit. Take for instance, omnipotence (often the source of these paradoxes). Here's what St. Paul said about Jesus' power: 

Yes. And it's quite likely that pain and suffering would be a useful design decision in a sufficiently complicated (and resource-intensive) machine. Issac Asimov's third law of robotics suggests that a sentient machine would need to know when it is being damaged or at risk of being damaged. Sensors that detect damage would be analogous to nerve-endings in humans and other animals (though likely based on different physical properties). Presumably signals from those sensors would be designed to interrupt the normal function of machine and demand to be addressed immediately. It's not clear that such signals would be experienced differently from what we call pain, if they are experienced at all. (What I mean is that what constitutes "experience" is difficult to pin down, so robots might not experience anything and therefore not experience pain either.) Now good design would suggest that signals indicating damage of function would persist no longer than necessary to deal with the damage. While the damage exists, the signals should continue and when the damage is repaired, the signals should subside. Certain types of damage would be signaled with higher priority (or potentially greater intensity) than others as some types of damage would be more urgent and important than others. Some signals would be of very low priority so that they could be ignored while pursuing more important goals. A well-designed machine would even include senors that detect potential hazards such as high temperatures or high-speed collisions. If a robot can be said to experience anything at all, it must also be able to experience a sensation we might call suffering. Failure to sense damage would be a serious problem for all but the most trivial sentient machines. I'm reminded of a book coauthored by Dr. Paul Wilson Brand, a pioneer in the treatment of leprosy or Hansen's disease. The book points out the sufferers of congenital analgesia are at great risk of physical damage from activities the pose little threat to normal people such as sleeping, walking or eating. Considering the difficulties faced by people who lack pain, we really aren't grateful enough for our occasional toothache or sore feet. 

A pleasing virtue of the common definitions is that they are often themselves postmodern! But a simple definition of postmodernism is that it is the set of reactions and responses to modernism. Modernism, as I understand it, is an equally vague mindset that says, "I've found the fount of all wisdom and knowledge. The more that I drink of it, the more certain I am of its truth." The fount could be just about anything: communism, fundamentalism, Freud, etc. It could also be a set of varied belief systems as long as they exclude other belief systems. (I recall a professor in college who was known for his "Marxist feminism" stance.) What matters to a modernist is that there does exist some set of beliefs that are demonstrably true. It's difficult to describe modernists without resorting to caricature, because many of the ideas that have been attached with modernism have been discredited by postmodernists. Postmodernists suggest that this isn't a single source of wisdom or that we can't have access to it or that each person has their own source or, well, whatever objections a person might find to the modernist standpoint. Ultimately, postmodernism stands for the idea that different sources of truth must be allowed to coexist in our society. It's easy to discover the influences (and sometimes conflicts) of postmodernism if you examine the position of religion in public over the last 100 or so years. Western religions usually assert a single source of truth and so are increasingly required to take a back seat in many forms of public expression. If you happen to be a programmer, you might find this talk by Larry Wall as helpful as I have. The simplest possible definition of the terms might be:
