Material Transport What about moving supplies? It's possible, of course, but you'll need to have a pressure-adjusted room available. If one portal is in a location with a higher atmospheric pressure - say, a few feet higher above sea level - the ambient air pressure will push air through. A little pressure difference is fine, but if there is enough of a difference, the wind blowing through the portal will be gale force - which means pushing materials through will be really hard, or really easy. And I'm quite sure delivering a pallet of tools at tornado-wind-speed is a bad idea. Assuming one portal is in a room where it is possible to stabilize pressure, and the other is used to transport materials, it shouldn't be too much trouble... except that there are only two portals. Which means that they will only be able to move to one location at a time... much like a standard airplane. That's fine if you need to move a lot of stuff, but with a round opening of only 6 meters at the widest, you won't be able to move a lot of really big stuff. Only things that already fit in airplanes or shipping boats. In reality, that's not going to get you much of anywhere. Accidents and Not-So-Accidents All technology has downsides; nuclear power, for instance, can leave a smoking radioactive crater if used improperly. That's bad. Misusing these portals? That's much, much, much worse. Here are a few examples of What Not To Do, with the best case in every example being "the portals are destroyed and stop working": 

Given enough time to prepare, even a small, low-tech group of barbarians can wipe out a heavily armed army of trained soldiers. Surprise is a massively useful weapon; no matter how well armed or how well trained a soldier is, if he is running around screaming and wetting himself, he might as well be a rabbit. So, you want to make this highly trained army into an army of rabbits. Fear and confusion are your best allies, and the best weapon to cause fear and confusion is fire! Fire is loud, hot, bright, and unpredictable. It's easy to find, and hard to fight. However, you also want plenty of theatrics. The more unexplainable events there are, the harder it will be for reason to overcome uncertainty, and the easier it will be to scare the life out of an army. I know you just wanted melee weapons, but sticking with a motif makes it much easier to plan in the end. First, costumes. You need three different costumes: Fire, Smoke, and Ash. 

Weapons You can carry around an armada inside a baseball. Or a sun. Or black holes. That alone is enough to rule the universe, but there's still more; instead of destroying your enemies, you can take them hostage. Along with their homeworld. Or their home solar system. You don't even have to fire a shot. Defense Distance makes a great shield. If the technology is fast enough, a wearable suit (or a ship-sized net) could be designed that inflates space around the wearer when projectiles are detected; the projectile would simply travel past the wearer. Stealth If you can operate the technology inside the field, then your ships can shrink themselves down to a tiny point, as could operatives. Of course, you could also hide you planet like that. And stealing information (or anything else) is easy when you can hide planets in the palm of your hand. Living Space Of course, you'd have all the living space you'd want; find a nice habitable planet, put it in a bubble with a lovely sun, and away you go. More people? Not a problem! Just stick some bubbles in living areas! A house could be no more than a doorway into an enlarged space. If you can stack bubbles, it's even easier; rows of doors, behind yet more rows of doors. Of course, you'll need a lot of oxygen and other resources, but as long as you have somewhere to pull those from, you can make 'shortened space' jumps to deliver it exactly where it needs to be. In fact, if you make your spaces just so, you could literally step from one planet to another by shrinking the space between them in a small area. Boundless trouble Of course... none of this comes without risk. If it is the space that grows and shrinks, but not the objects inside, then a failed field could create an explosion as all the stuff inside is shoved into 'normal space'. On the other hand, if the things inside shrink and grow with the field, you may well end up with material that isn't the same size as it used to be. A number 12 bolt may go into a field just right, but come out a little bigger. Joe Smith may take the 8:05 to work and the 5:20 home, and end up growing taller every day. If the fields retain mass, then moving a planet around is going to be just as hard inside a field as outside, and probably harder - every time you shrink something big, you run the risk of making a tiny black hole. Or a not-so-tiny black hole, if you're shrinking solar systems. A maze may work a little too well; if you forget the way out, you're stuck. Communication will be almost impossible, unless you can invent something that doesn't interact with space itself. The ever-changing shape of 'space' near a field would distort radio signals, and a moving field would scramble radio signals into mush. If something with a larger area than a cross-section of the field hit the field, the object would be torn apart; the outside dimensions would stay the same, be the inside dimensions would grow. 4 units of material stretched across 4000 units of space isn't going to last long. And finally, great technology can put you far ahead of everyone else, but it can also make you a target. If you use this technology, weaponize it first, because everyone else is going to want to take it away from you. 

Before birth, a human grows from a zygote (a single cell) to a baby with the right number of arms, eyes, lungs, and so on - ready to live without direct support (that is, nutrients from the mother). The process takes roughly 9 months. After birth, babies spend roughly two decades growing into an adult. The DNA map is followed further; while the exact length of time varies, most humans stop physically changing by their mid 20s. At that point, the body is complete. Cells die and are replaced, and for the next several decades, humans don't change very much. As cells are replaced, there are occasional copy errors - cellular mutations. Eventually, the mutations pile up and begin to affect the body: wrinkles, muscle atrophy, and so on. Given enough copy errors, entire organs can fail, eventually resulting in death.
