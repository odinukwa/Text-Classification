I've had good results with everything else suggested by HIT exponents like Darden and Mentzer, so it's definitely worth a shot applying this as well. 

OK, this is speculation as I'm not a woman, but in reading The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook by Clair Davies I came across a bit that mentioned some trigger points on the legs can contribute to a much more painful period, and it doesn't strike me as odd that running could set that off as well. If nobody else can give you a useful answer, I'd suggest checking out that book, or if healthcare is affordable for you, see a gynecologist. 

Stronglifts 5x5 is a really good place to start. A lot of people have had good results with it - I have too doing a similar variation, although very quickly I had to change up the schedule to several more rest days. The base principle of a few compound lifts with progressively increasing weights stays the same. The exercise selection and frequency might change a bit depending on the results you're getting. Strength is pretty much a necessary foundation for everything else. Getting stronger will improve your endurance and cardiovascular performance (although obviously endurance training will improve it more). So you'll build up your strength first, maybe spending a year to hit your target of 1.5-2x your bodyweight, and then look at other workouts you might want to do (or perhaps see just how far you can work your strength). You could try to work on both at the same time, but I'd say focus primarily on strength, as it's something you can build into a habit before you start throwing in something else. If you try to pile too much on, you'll find it much harder to make a habit of. 

Strictly speaking, completely untrue. Anyone with short muscle bellies throughout their body will be a hardgainer no matter what they eat or what they do - your muscles can never gain more girth than they have length, as it would be impossible for them to contract otherwise. If you have universally short muscle bellies, the only two possible outcomes of eating a lot are remaining skinny as a rail or getting fat, but it will never lead to significantly increased muscle mass. That said, muscle belly length isn't uniform throughout the body, so chances are everyone has some muscles with longer bellies that can be worked on to gain some extra size. The outcome usually won't be that aesthetically pleasing however - Ronnie Coleman is a good inverse example, he has generally large muscle bellies except for his biceps, which look quite silly compared to everything else. It would be the same if you have mostly short muscle bellies with one set of muscles with medium or long muscle bellies and looking comically large compared to the rest of you. If you're someone like that, your best option is to just train for strength and endurance, and use the fact that you won't gain much bodyweight to perform well in sports that benefit from strength but contraindicate weight gain. 

Looking at the letter of the question, no, you could do deadlifts instead. But in the spirit of the question, yes, you really should do a compound lift involving your legs and back. Try to pick at least one that you can do safely and without pain (front squat, back squat, ball squat, hack squat, standard deadlift, sumo deadlift). If absolutely none of them work and you've researched how to do them properly (Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe and The Insider's Tell-All Handbook on Weight-Training Technique by Stuart McRobert are both good books to look into) then you could do leg presses instead - it's generally accepted that free weights are more productive than machines, but if you get injured doing free weights but not the machines, then in that unfortunate instance, machines are better. Interestingly, nobody can really agree whether the squat or deadlift is better, even Rippetoe who starts off saying the squat's the best exercise period has a diagram in the back of his book that seems to suggest the deadlift is better. That got a chuckle out of me. I happen to prefer the deadlift because I can perform it more comfortably, also just conceptually because training to lift something heavy off the ground is an incredibly practical movement to train. As for reducing the belly, I'm a skinny guy but was getting a bit self conscious about my belly sticking out, purely doing deadlifts, overhead presses and pulldowns I got it pulled in a bit. I couldn't really pinpoint which of the exercises was responsible, although I'd be inclined to attribute it to all of them due to the need to stabilise with my core muscles while performing those exercises. I don't have experience myself with fat burning, but I've read from numerous sources (which could be just a bunch of people referring to a single study, I'm not claiming that there's scientific consensus here) that beginners doing weight training see both fat loss and muscle gain. 

I don't do anything complex, I just try to eat as much fat as possible. Straight butter, several eggs with yolks, high fat yogurt, 6% if I have to settle, but 11% has been showing up more often in stores recently, quark if I'm in a country that sells it, a couple ounces whipping cream, fish oil... anything like that. That lets me last the whole day on one meal. For rehydrating, a canteen with boullion is nice, as is coconut water, but regular water works nicely too. Lean towards drinking less rather than more, drinking too much just makes you feel like you're going to puke while you're running. Plus, recent research is showing that most people over-hydrate, leading to hyponatremia. I don't spend much time running or training so I could fall under the beginner, but I've done full and half marathons without training for them, so it's something that works. My dad did the same thing for long distance runs in the army. Dean Karnazes eats similarly for when he runs as well, several pizzas loaded with as much as possible, that he'll eat while he's running. Beginner, intermediate, ultra-advanced - all the same idea for a runners diet. Fat gives you a lot of energy in total, but it gets released slowly which is exactly what you need for running. On days that you're not running, eat however you need to to feel good - not fatigued, no aches, no problems with bowel movements, etc. That's going to be individual though, 7 billion diets for 7 billion people as Julie Daniluk would say. 

When I started lifting I lacked range of motion around the hips for a deadlifting motion, so I had (in my case dumbbells) raised up so I could do them with good form. However, after a few weeks I just put them on the floor as my range of motion had increased sufficiently to allow me to do it from lower. Start off with just a single weight plate on each side with the barbell on the floor and either have someone video you or watch you so you can see if your form is good enough with the lower height. Then work your way back up to the weight you were at before. 

Back squats are a great start, but I would also suggest doing front squats because it's feasible to go much deeper with them, and going very deep (ass to calves) with a front squat uses your hamstrings more than the back squat to just below parallel. The deadlift works your lower back more, so by adding both front squats and deadlifts you're approaching the butt area from both sides. Also, the deadlift and front squat are quite good for a lot of other muscles, so you'll be ending up in better shape overall. There might be some isolation exercises you could do, but I prefer to see what benefits can be achieved from compound exercises, and only resort to isolation exercises if absolutely necessary - I like to spend as little time working out as possible. If you're doing multiple work sets of back squats now, I would recommend against suddenly throwing on an equal number of sets for the front squat and the deadlift. If, for example, you're doing 4 sets now, cut it down to 2, so you're doing 6 sets total for the 3 lifts. 

It can be done. Don't heel strike, ever, that's what's going to kill your knees, regardless of the surface you're on. Make sure you land on your forefoot or midfoot (forefoot if it's more of a run, midfoot if it's more of a jog), with your body weight over top of your feet. If it's behind your feet, your knees suffer. To make it easy to not heel strike, don't wear shoes with a raised heel - anything more than Nike Free 3.0s is too much, if you can get minimalist shoes that have no heel at all, and soles only a few mm thick, all the better. The reason barefoot runners don't have knee problems is the soles of the feet are very sensitive, so if you're landing with any kind of impact, your feet hurt before you're even damaging your knees. You said barefoot isn't an option for you, and I agree, I don't want to run in dog poop or on broken glass, but I still go for thin shoes that let me feel the ground very easily. As for reliable and verifiable studies - there aren't any. Anyone who has an attachment to the traditional running method or the minimalist running method will be able to poke holes in any study supporting the other side. Incidentally, there aren't any studies that show that traditional running shoes offer any sort of benefit (and I would suggest if there haven't been any in 40 years, they're not going to ever show up), conversely there haven't been any to satisfy doubters that minimilast or barefoot running is any safer. But if you wear shoes that make it easy for your feet to hurt, you just make sure you're running in a way that they don't hurt. If they do start hurting and you can't change your technique so it stops. Cut your run short and walk home. If you're wearing shoes that offer lots of cushioning, you'll only find out there was a problem when your knees start hurting. Also, the no heel striking rule doesn't apply when walking, although you don't want to literally "strike", it's more of a roll over your heel on the outside of your foot to the balls. Another thing I've heard suggested, but haven't been able to test for myself or find any studies to back up (no surprise there), is that a higher cadence and shorter stride is associated with lower injury rates.
