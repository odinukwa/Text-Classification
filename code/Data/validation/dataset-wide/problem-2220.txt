I found "The national sport of Germany is football" at $URL$ My personal experience visiting my inlaws in a village in northern Germany with my two boys is that in addition, soccer is a big deal in everyday life, in addition to the pro teams, the World Cup, etc. 

My twelve-year-old recently tried downhill mountain biking when we were in Lake Placid. He found it thrilling and would like to continue with this new sport now that we are back home. I am hesitant for him to practice this sport on a regular basis because of safety concerns. We allow - basketball (with mouth guard) - soccer (with shin guards -- by the way, should he use the mouth guard as well when he is playing goalie?) - swimming - tennis - cross country skiing - ice skating for fun We do not allow games with a stick -- ice hockey, lacrosse. And we do not allow American football or downhill skiing. I'd like to be reasonably consistent with our existing policy! Where does downhill mountain bike riding (on an established track at a reputable ski center) fit, on the scale of things? He has asked for a full-face helmet and elbow and knee pads, because that's what he was given to use as part of the fee at Lake Placid. 

My son has gone to several summer camps where archery was one of the special once-a-week activities (YMCA and similar type day camps). He enjoyed it. He seemed to have learned the basics of technique and safety in those camps. Half a year ago we bought him an archery set and a separate, big padded target. Here's what the bow looks like: 

I've never seen an instance of dropped catches or missed stumpings being recorded in official statistics. They may be written into scorebooks as "incidents" or further annotations, but I don't believe they're recorded specifically. Looking at Cricinfo's Statsguru Test Bowling I don't see an ability to search by those items, which would lead me to believe they're not available. 

This is not out. The law is very clear - see $URL$ - section 2 has clause 3, which says it is not out when "it occurs when he is trying to avoid being run out or stumped." 

This is covered by Law 38, Section 3. It states that the person run out shall be the one whose ground is closest to the end where the wicket is put down. Both batsmen have left their ground, so Law 29 section 2, clause C states that "each ground belongs to whichever batsman is nearer to it" hence batsman B is out. 

Depends on how you define a bowler - Border has 39 test wickets, so he could qualify! Based on the Cricinfo appearances list, the first player not primarily identified as a batsman (that I can see) is Garfield Sobers, who was an all-rounder. The first primary bowler I can see is Anil Kumble (not Glenn McGrath as previously stated). Note that this is from a quick scan of the list, and opinions may vary. 

This would come under Rule 18 - Ball at rest moved by outside agency Essentially there is no penalty to the player, and the ball should be replaced. Note that you need to be sure it was an outside agency that moved the ball - neither wind nor water count. 

In all of those deals the buying club should get to an agreement with the selling club about player price. Then the buying club should get to an agreement with the player (or his agent) about player contract. If this is an exchange deal (section 5) the selling club should also get to an agreement with the exchanging player (or his agent) about player contract. I can think about some reasons for a player move/transfer: 

You are right that the French Open is the only Grand Slam tournament without Hawkeye, The reason is that Clay, unlike grass and hardcourts, leaves a mark that players and umpires can check and verify if the ball was in or out. You can argue that some mistakes can be made but that's quite rare, A hawkeye system is very expensive and the cost/benefit ratio doesn't pays. Gilbert Ysern, the director general of the French Open and a former umpire, address to this: 

So the question is what deliberately means. The section about Handling the ball explains the list of points the referee should consider before deciding the hand ball was deliberately and awarding a free kick. 

As for your third question, it is very hard to answer it because it can include trophies? can it include friendly games? can it be at any league level(for example english fourth division)? the most league goals scored in a season I found was 134 by Peterborough United at english Fourth Division, 1960–61 season.

The elevation on pitcher's mound was made in order to return some advantages to pitchers that was lost due to extending the pitcher position. 

Clarification: I'd like to avoid fractures, of course, but I'd mainly like to avoid really serious injuries and things that might leave him with longlasting health problems such as a knee or back that is never the same again. I'm not worried about scratches or bruises. 

He enjoys practicing in our yard and has been using it with good safety consciousness. He has never had the fantasy of bow hunting -- perhaps because we don't know anyone who does this, perhaps because of the context in which he learned to do archery. We live in the suburbs of a college town. There are some bow hunting enthusiasts in our area, but we don't happen to be personally acquainted with any. Recently I was chatting with the mechanic who keeps my ancient Toyotas going. He lives waay out in the country, and he said my son should be attending archery classes, which are held at sporting and hunting stores. I would just as soon avoid those places, because my son does have fantasies of going deer hunting with firearms, but I am uncomfortable with firearms (for personal reasons that I won't get into here), and I'm afraid going to such a store on a weekly basis would inflame his interest in deer hunting and it would become an obsession. (He has OCD.) Another thing is that, although my son hasn't stopped to think about this yet, the truth is that he would find the blood and the death of the deer EXTREMELY distressing. (He has heightened reactions to blood, and death, due to his OCD.) Can we continue the way we've been doing, or do we really need to take him to archery classes? 

Section 9 of Law 18 covers this situation - in both cases no runs are scored. Once the batsman is dismissed no runs can be credited to the batting side. 

You can, but if I was 1st slip I'd refuse to stand where you suggested. The ball comes fastest to first slip, and the extra distance is to allow the player to react. To answer your question, there are no restrictions preventing you from doing it, just logical reasons why it doesn't happen. 

You need to contact your local cricket authority - I think you can find them at $URL$ The normal procedure is to do a preliminary training course, and pass an exam, all on the laws of the game and practices of umpiring. Then you start umpiring in matches (lower-league adult games or childrens' games). If you're good enough, and prepared to put in the time and effort, you will progress through the ranks. Good luck with it - umpiring is very enjoyable and a great way to be involved in the game at any level. 

I'm not sure what you mean by "shuffling", but it's standard technique to move according to where the ball is delivered to. Keeping the head still is vital to pick up the line of the ball, then movement to get into that line and allow you play the most appropriate shot. The standard coaching manual will suggest that the first movement should be with the back foot, and this should be across the stumps and backwards. This is used by a lot of batsmen, but by no means all. Even in international cricket there are a huge range of styles. 

Winner - a shot hit by a player so the ball jumps more than once on the opponent side without the opponent being able to even touch the ball. Example Unforced error - a mistake made by the player from quite an easy shot hitted by from the opponent for example hitting the ball wrong, lack of precision or improper position. Number of unforced errors usually counted for statistics and indicate the level of each player's game. Example

The answer to both of your first question is Australia 31–0 win over American Samoa - You can read about it on Wiki and even see highlits of the game over youtube There is some confusion about the score at the end of the match since the score board shows 32-0 but: 

The answer is Yes. Every team can decide to sell tickets for training, I can give you an example from soccer since I'm not familiar with MLB. Most of the time the income from friendly games or training goes to charity. Real Madrid practice on there US tour cost between $85-382 as you can read at the following link. 

Each team points are calculated in a four-year period. Calculation of points for a single match is calculated in the following formula: 

This question is very general and can be change through time and league. In the best research I found was from: Science and Football V: The Proceedings of the 5th World Congress on Science and Football.
