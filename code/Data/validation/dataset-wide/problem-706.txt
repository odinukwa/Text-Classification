Late answer, however I though it worth adding a manufacturer (Thanks to answer to another question) that does this without loading the seat stay as much as the Thule. oldmanmoutain They attach to the axle and brake bosses (if you have them) or use P clamps on the seat stay. Have a load rating of 40 lb. looking at the design most of the weight would be on the axle mounts, meaning much less stress on the frame components. 

At some point you are still on the bike, but the mistake has already been made and you are looking for the exit option that will minimise damage. Jamming the front brake on while in a tight corner does not 'minimise damage' Experience rider would have probably seen the debris earlier or not been riding as fast, and is always thinking what alternatives they have if things go wrong. The rear brake is best in corners, it will induce a rear wheel slide which is much easier to control and ends in a fall and slide rather than tumble that tends to happen with a front wheel lock up. Only use the front once you have lost some speed with the rear, straightened up and are ready for the front wheel to be loaded by the braking action. To a point, equipment such as tires won't help much - with better equipment, you will just be going faster. Lights will help in this instance, as it sounds like you were riding faster than your visibility allowed to do so safely. In the future: 

The brakes are mechanical brakes. Normally (I don't know this brand) the brake lever moves one side of the pads only and pushes the disc against the other. When properly adjusted the disc moves very slightly into the non-moveable pad. Normally the pad that move is the outboard pad, and the fixed one is the inside pad. To adjust you probably need to unwind the inside pad 1/4 or 1/2 turn, and maybe readjust the calipers. Refer Here for some good instructions. 

Ring the bike shop before doing anything. They may prefer you take it back to them rather than try to fix it yourself. All it probably needs a calliper alignment. Briefly - Loosen the two bolts holding the calliper so its free to move but is not sloppy. Slowly bring the brakes on while spinning the wheel. Once the brakes are on tight, without releasing the brakes, tighten the bolts a little. Pump the brakes a few times while spinning the wheel then fully tighten the bolts. Look up how to do it on the internet if in doubt. Use a torque wrench if you have one. If not, do not over tighten the bolts (Pay attention to how tight they were when you loosened them). 

I recently looked at my 3x10 setup, with the view of going 1x. I decided to stay 3x10 as the 1x10 is a can of worms. The only other practical option was to convert the whole lot to 1x11. With 32->11-36, on the flat 32-11 I spin out a little, but am not strong enough to push 32-36 up the local hills. What to do will significantly be dictated by the specs and components already installed on the bike in question (In this case Shimano), but ultimately, 1x10 is never going to make a great bike for less strong riders. The 10x (from Shimano, and I also think SRAM, some correct me if i am wrong) is not made for larger than 36 tooth rear cluster. The 11-36 range is not enough for many riders in hilly terrain. Lower gearing comes from a bigger rear cog, smaller chain ring or smaller wheels. In this case, you are looking at 27.5", smaller wheels are not going to make any real difference. You can extend max cog size of the standard Shimano 10x derailleurs (Not sure about the M610 - I think it has to be the XT derailleur) - e.g. 'goat link' and 'radcage', and buy cassettes (sunrace) or expansion cogs to take you 10X to 42 or 46 teeth. Ultimately is not what I would choose to do on a new bike as they are all various degrees of a hack with various degrees of success. This leaves a chainring. This bike comes with 30 - you may be able to go down to 26 with direct mount cranks, but I looks like this comes with 104bcd meaning 30 is as small as you can go without a new crank set. You don't want to small unless you don't mind going slow, or know how to spin... 28/11 is a fairly low top gear. Ultimately I suggest if you have any doubts that go to a 2x10 or a 1x11 (Shimano has recently announced a SLX 1x11). 

A $600 dollar bike fit would be a professional fit where the set the bike up, adjusting everything to the last millimeter, replacing components as required and making the bike as fast and comfortable as humanly possible. Such a fit will save you a few seconds over a hundred kilometers of riding. For a 14km commute it is not needed. (Everyone would benefit from a good fit, some more so due to discomfort and bio-mechanical problems, but the gains of spending the time and money quickly diminish) When buying a bike, the most important thing to get right is the frame size, everything else is adjustable (with or without replacing parts). From a simple sales perspective, frame size is determined by height and will probably be correctly chosen 90% of the time using just height. Best thing to do is buy a bike from a reputable LBS. At no extra cost they should help you select the right bike (size, style etc), and set it up to fit you. They won't go as far as the $600 fit, but should have you riding out of the shop on a bike you can comfortably and reasonably efficiently ride for the distances you are needing. (Things like seat height, handle bar height etc). 

Two questions here - restore an old bike and what bike for your wife. Lets deal with the easy one - an old Specialised will be a better bike than a department store one. If you need much more gear to be replaced, consider looking for a donor. Add another $100 to you list for things that might need doing - like new cluster and chain rings, brake pads etc. Strip and repack wheel bearings and headset and you are probably good to go. From the sound of it though, a second hand bike might be a better option, as the deterioration that requires those parts replaced almost certainly means other parts are on their last legs. Cannot tell for sure without seeing it. Next one - What bike should your wife ride - that depends on your relationship. I see this all the time- Fit, active strong guy out on the trials riding a multi-thousand dollar ultra efficient lightweight bike miles ahead of his partner who clearly does not live breath and dream cycling like he does and is nowhere near as fit. She is struggling on an old beater her partner would not be seen dead riding, miles behind, exhausted and close to tears....... If you don't like your wife, and/or want to be sent our riding on your own with her blessing, give her the beater. If you like your wife, and/or would like her to like you, enjoy riding and spend quality cycling time with you, give her the nicest bike and ride the beater. If she gets to like riding, you can buy her a nice bike that fits her properly. Play you cards right, you can buy her a better bike than yours, and when you go out solo - ride that...... (Presumption I have made is that the bikes fit both riders. My wife and me fit the same frame size. I have two seat posts and seats for "her" bike - one set up for for her, one for me.....)
