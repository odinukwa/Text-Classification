Michael Frolik scored one of four Blackhawk goals on a penalty shot. He has a 1/2 Shooting % and Jimmy Howard has a 24/28 save statistic (not 24/27 as it would be if it didn't count) and 4 GA. You can also see that a penalty shot counts against the "Even Strength Goals Against", at least if it's not during a powerplay separately from the penalty that incurs the shot - Jimmy Howard has 3 EV GA and allowed one powerplay goal to open the scoring to Hossa. Shootout goals do not count; for example: 

At its core, what a 'rebuilding' team means is that it's going through a losing stretch that's expected, because it doesn't have the tools needed to be competitive. As such: 

This follows the initial rule, so it is intended to modify or limit that rule. In this case, the initial rule is clearly intended to read that a team may not call timeout after making a basket; before the 'last two minutes' clock stoppage was added (sometime in the last couple of decades I believe), that was sufficient. Once that rule was added, a clarification was needed to make it clear that it is not intended for a team to be able to call timeout after making a shot even if the clock stops, unless there is a separate interruption. 

That is, when at least one of them gets a hit, the expected value of total bases is 1.55 from the two of them. SLG works well with other statistics, to some extent, this way; you can derive things like isolated power (ISO), which tells you what proportion of their slugging percentage comes from XBH explicitly. You can't explicitly calculate the probability of an XBH from it, though, since the proportion of 2B|3B|HR can vary with identical SLG/AVGs. (Take one HR and one Single, and make them 1 2B and 1 3B, for example; identical SLG and AVG for those two results.) 

Based on my understanding (but no explicit mention in the rulebook), otherwise the officials are "in play" and no particular exception exists for stopping play due to linesmen or referees obstructing play. Clearly they are instructed to avoid doing so whenever possible, but if they're unable to avoid the play, the play stands (unless a goal goes off of an official). It goes without saying that this only applies to NHL games and other games which take place under NHL rules. 

In order for a batter to reach first base safely, though, all other runners must advance to the next base as well. Why? If they don't reach the next base, they would have to retreat to the base they were on - at which point the batter would be called out (when two players occupy a base simultaneously, the trailing runner is ruled out). So a force out is really a way of extending this concept. 

Etc.; it gave basic information, but not the detailed information you have now. You can see an example of this on Pro-Football-Reference's PBP of the 1989 Superbowl. As such, you can't separate things like run-after-catch and things like that from the total play; you simply get a single number. With the advent of advanced statistics, you get interest in having that additional detail - as you say, passing yards with little run after catch are very different from ones with more run after catch. In the interest of keeping things comparable from one era to the other, "old" stats will tend to stay the same: QB Passing Yards will still be total yards, for example. But instead, you have new statistics. 

The specific foul that they're calling (and is often called a "reach in" foul) is the defensive player touching the offensive player ("making contact") in a disallowed way. "Re-routing" as referred in the other answer is actually a different rule - that affects all players, but players guarding the player possessing the ball have a separate, more restrictive ruleset governing them. Most defensive fouls consist of violations of this rule - basically, don't touch the player with the ball except in specifically allowed ways. The rule is Rule 12, B, Section 1, (b). Most of Section 1 (except the penalties) is reproduced below. 

While it discusses passing another runner, the concept is the same as abandoning the basepaths. As such, my previous statement was correct - but clarified a bit. As long as the winning run scored prior to Ishikawa leaving the basepaths and abandoning his attempt to score, that winning run counts - but only that run, and the game ends. The only way the game would not end is if both 'outs' occurred before the winning run scored. 

I don't see anything official - there have if anything been rule changes/enforcement changes to encourage calling certain penalties, such as at the beginning of 2013, but certainly there haven't been any official rules making it harder to call penalties (or removing a significant penalty from the books). My feeling is it's three things. First, as players get stronger/better, it becomes easier to score on power plays - so players are avoiding committing penalties more than they used to. Second, as the league cracks down on dangerous play, some players are avoiding committing acts that might cause a penalty because they also want to avoid suspensions; they also decreased the value of the enforcer (by suspending many of them). Finally, referees seem to simply be not calling penalties they once used to, and the NHL is largely okay with that. 5 on 5 hockey is actually more interesting - more open - than power plays; while it leads to fewer scores, power plays are often fairly boring to watch, with teams playing sets that are largely not involving big hits or action (until they shoot, anyway). The most interesting thing to happen during a penalty is often a shorthanded breakaway. 5 on 5 is more interesting to watch, so having more 5 on 5 is fine for the folks upstairs - and 5 on 5 scoring is doing just fine. This article from The Hockey News gives some background, and shows 5 on 5 scoring is still up. This article from Big D, a Dallas Stars blog goes into some of the possible reasons, and shows some more stats. The one thing that does seem consistent in what I read: the decrease is fewer obstruction or interference calls. 

Wax Eagle covers some interesting points, but the most important point in why many relievers typically only pitch one inning is that they can throw the ball harder if they're only throwing 20 or so pitches. This isn't true across the board; in particular, relievers who use offspeed pitches to get outs likely throw about the same strength as they would as starters. However, flamethrowing relievers typically lose 2-3 MPH from their fastballs when converted to starters; look at Chris Sale for example. He was primarily a reliever his first two years (2010-2011) and then became a starter after that. He averaged 95 MPH as a reliever, and 93 MPH as a starter on his fastball - and had much, much higher maximums; as a reliever he threw 100 MPH his first year in the majors, and hasn't hit much over 98 since he became a starter. This is why certain pitchers typically are designated as relievers in the current day, even if they're quite talented; look at Aroldis Chapman, for example. He's one of the best pitchers of any sort in the majors, and he's a reliever despite attempting to make him a starter: that's because as a reliever he can simply throw the ball past his opponents (hitting 100MPH on over half of his pitches this season). He'd likely lose a few MPH as a starter, and might be less effective. (He might still be more valuable to the team, but that's a coach and general managers' decision to make.) Long relievers aren't used (most of the time) because they'd be getting the worst of both worlds. They couldn't throw as hard, because they'd be needed for 60 ish pitches, but they'd only be throwing 1/3 of a game (versus a starter throwing upwards of 2/3). They also wouldn't be able to pitch all that often (relievers who do pitch 3 innings due to a bad starter's performance usually get several days off afterwards). Instead, you can have three guys each throw very hard, plus the flexibility as Wax Eagle notes to pitch to matchups and such, gaining overall more out of your bullpen than you would if you had fewer, longer relievers. 

The Safety rule is actually pretty specific anyway: it must be carried behind the goalline by an impetus by a team, meaning, an intentional act (not being driven backwards). Rule 11, Section 5: 

Notre Dame became Notre Dame because it was one of the best football schools in the early days of college football, when a great coach with a few interesting strategies could make all the difference in the quality of a school's team. They then managed to keep that advantage instead of either disbanding the football team (Thanks for the memories, Amos Alonzo Stagg) or losing the momentum due to poor coaching or difficult entry requirements (see Yale/Harvard/Army/Navy etc.). Notre Dame managed to find a compromise in terms of academics that allowed them to recruit effectively while maintaining a mostly high academic standard (compared to other schools with strong football programs) when the great shift from the Ivies to the State Schools occurred in the middle of the century. In this case, it was Knute Rockne who led the school to prominence. He played for them in the early 1910s, and in 1913 led them to beat the then-dominant Army team soundly (35-13) thanks to his practicing the forward pass with his quarterback extensively during the off-season; the forward pass was legal but rarely used in football at the time. He then became the head coach starting a few years later (1918), and led them to four national championships (1919, 1924, 1929, 1930, using the NCF designation as is usual in that era) and regularly won 9 or 10 games per year. He emphasized athleticism and speed, a change from many other teams at the time who were more of the pounding sort. He introduced the 'shift' (ie, changing alignment just before the snap). He also continued to emphasize the modern forward pass - while other teams did use passes, they tended to be shorter, screen-variety, while he used passing more extensively and more downfield. He also was a great showman, as Wikipedia goes into some length to describe; as much as winning games, he had to sell the school and make the team profitable (or at least pay for itself!) as athletics weren't the big industry back then they are now. Notre Dame then built on his legacy in the 40s and 50s with Frank Leahy, who won four national championships and had the second highest winning percentage in NCAA history (.846). Future coaches built on the legacy, with several more national championships and very competitive teams until the last decade or so the SEC recruiting advantage seems to have lessened their status, although they still manage to be competitive on a fairly regular basis. They continue to have a few advantages. One is their TV deal, which as being a single school with no conference to share revenue with is substantial, and pays for very good facilities. They also have a national following (driving the TV deal, among other things) because they are one of the leading Catholic schools in the nation, so their alumni tend to be more spread out over the country than a state school who would have most of their alumni centered near the school. 

I charted the KRs and PRs returned for a touchdown since 1994 (the complete play by play era of PFR). This data is lightly edited to remove inaccuracies due to issues in the PFR system.1 This includes all games, both regular season and playoff, so slightly higher numbers than Ed's which are only regular season as far as I can tell. As you can see, prior to 2010 the KR and PR seemed to be similar in number; sometimes kicks (blue) and sometimes punts (red) are higher in total for that season. However, after 2010 only one season (2012) had a number of kicks returned for touchdowns greater than 10. 

FC itself is actually quite common in another sport: Rugby. "XXX Rugby Football Club" is commonly the name of rugby clubs (at the club level). This is true even in the US (where "Club" is not a very common term); in Chicago, for example, we have the Chicago Lions Rugby Football Club, Lincoln Park RFC, etc. In US-primary sports, "Club" is used sporadically, but usually not as the primary descriptor. Many teams do technically call themselves clubs, though, via their official corporation; the Chicago Cubs Baseball Club LLC for example; Chicago Bears Football Club Inc, etc. However, they're not usually described using those words - it's just "Chicago Bears". That's because of the prevalence of team names in US-primary sports; you need to say "Manchester City Football Club" because there might also be "Manchester City Rugby Football Club" and "Manchester City Cricket Club". In the US, and thus in sports that originated or came to popularity in the US, team names ("Chicago Bears", etc.) are more common and therefore don't need to have the sport added on to differentiate them. So, my suggestion would be that if you're expecting a US audience, simply use team names; but if you're expecting a primarily European audience and not giving teams names (beyond their home city), "basketball club" is perfectly reasonable. 

Now, it's perfectly reasonable to guess that both the Olympics and the NFL have the same root reason - Roman Numerals seem fancier, of course. 

It's hard enough to score in American football when you have half an hour to score in. Trying to score when you have 0:30 left in the game? Nearly impossible, if you're on your side of the field. The fundamental problem here is that the defense knows what's going on. They know you have 0:30 left, and need to get to the 30 yard line or so in order to kick a FG. If you're, say, on your own 30 - then you have 40 yards to go. So the defense just needs to make sure you don't get to the 30, but is perfectly okay with you getting ten or twenty yards - as long as you don't get those 40. So you're left with the problem, particularly if you are out of time outs, of quickly getting those yards. You're going to run the ball? Might work, and some teams do. HB Screen pass actually is a bit better - lets you get the WRs downfield to clear out the safeties from the box. Or HB draw. That's better, except when it's mercilessly mocked of course. And it doesn't tend to work - maybe Adrian Peterson might knock in an 70 yard run, but more running plays end in fumbles than in 70 yard runs. Specifically, there have been 68 fumbles lost in 9221 rushing plays so far in 2015. 3/4 of a percent of plays involve a fumble lost. This doesn't count plays that are aborted, either, i.e. fumbled snaps. On the other hand, there have been 23 rushing plays yielding 50 yards or more so far this year. 40 yards is a bit more, but still well under 68 - 43 plays total. And that includes many situations where the defense is playing more of a press defense - something they would never do with 0:30 left to go in the half. All that, and a rushing play that didn't go out of bounds would have to either score or leave enough time on the clock for a FG, right? Okay, so we're not going to run - we're going to pass, right? Except, that's far worse. Rushing, odds are nothing happens. No fumble, no points, just a few wasted plays. Passing, though, you have a big risk. When the defense knows you're going to pass, or at least is okay mostly ignoring the run because they can still play such that the RB gets 10-15 yards but no more, you have a lot more interceptions. 202 of these plays have been run in 2015 with 2:00 in the 4th or less remaining, down by a TD or less (but down), and 10 of them resulted in picks. 5% of plays like this result in picks. While most of those aren't pick sixes, that's often because a game-ending pick is brought out of bounds or just downed to avoid the risk of a fumble by the DB who picked it off. On the other hand, only one was successful - Jameis Winston vs. the Giants - at scoring a TD, and ... oh, wait, no, that one wasn't successful either - the other team scored on a fumbled lateral. Zero plays in that situation have been successful this year: because defenses know how to prevent them. Some probably have yielded a FG eventually - but it's not common, and it's much more likely to lose the ball. Zone defenses are the main reason for this. Defense knows you have to pass the ball 20-30 yards, right? So they sit back far off the line, facing the QB, and everyone reads the QB's eyes. That makes it much easier to pick the ball off (rather than just running alongside the WR and trying to keep up with him). Zone prevent defenses are terrible at keeping offenses from advancing the ball 10-20 yards - and in a longer situation, 2:00 drill, they're actually pretty bad defenses. But with 0:30 left? Quite effective. So - what's your call? (Of course, as Bill Barnwell loved to point out, coaches still do run these plays... especially the basically pointless HB draws...)
