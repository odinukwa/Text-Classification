First, if you use a 26" wheel in back, you won't have any brakes as they won't reach (unless you have rear discs). Second, because you mention that you want a sprocket chain on the left hand side going to the motor, I assume you're going for some kind of off-board solution. These have been really deprecated with the rise in good hub motors as well as mid-drive solutions. Update: you clarified that you wanted both the motor and the regular chain on the right hand side. As far as I know, there aren't any freewheels that are split so that they can take two chains that freewheel separately. The best you can do in this scenario is to use a regular freewheel and put a one-way bearing on the cog that's on the motor. It'll mean the motor chain will not freewheel -- but it'll also mean the cranks will move when the motor is moving (with the real possibility of breaking your ankles). The safer way is to use a flip-flop hub or disc-brake mount to put the sprockets on the left hand side using either a left-hand freewheel or a one-way on the motor. That way, the bike's freewheel will make sure that you can't break your ankles. 

The clamps most probably got a bit squished in the mail. You should be able to make them a bit larger with a pair of needlenose pliers. I would try expanding them (without the tightening bolt) so that they fit over, then bringing the two arms together with the pliers and putting the bolt in. 

There are three places to explore: the shifter, the cable housing or the front derailleur. Given that you can't shift up (to a higher/bigger front chainring) and that the shifter feels that it's disconnected, my guess is that it's the shifter (#1 below) that is frozen since the symptoms of #2 and #3 are that shifts down to a smaller chainring are slow/harder; and/or that the shifter feels hard/stuck when shifting up, not loose which is what you're experiencing. 

I find the ideal commuter bike is: lightweight, reliable, and inexpensive. Reliable: A commuter bike can’t fail or you’ll be late for work. Light weight: it has to be lightweight as you’re navigating it around bike stands, carrying it up stairs, taking it over curbs, and putting it on bus racks or in the trunk of a car that’s come to pick you up when and if your bike breaks by the side of the road and you can’t fix it before being late for work. Inexpensive: your commuter bike often has a shortened lifespan. It either gets stolen, hit by a car, or damaged by the elements. If you’re buying new, the bike you’re looking is likely inexpensive but likely fails in terms of reliability and weight if it has front suspension. Most bikes that are inexpensive and have front or full suspension are what we call on this forum somewhat derisively [Bicycle Shaped Objects] or BSOs. A used steel-frame road bike or hybrid with no suspension that can fit panniers is often a much better choice for commuting. 

p.s. I'm noting that the black cheapo dual-pump head whose image above I shamelessly stole off e-bay only goes for 1-3 eurodollars, shipped from China. You could just get another one at that price. I'd personally recommend: 1) continuing to use the one you have using a schrader-presta adapter; 2) get a dedicated single-head; or, 3) get a well-machined universal head. 

For cardboard boxes, they might actually survive in good enough condition to use on the return trip. Bring or buy lots of duct tape. Transporting a bike box from place to place is a pain because they don't have wheels, be sure to also get a trolley: 

Do you have two wires going to your front and rear lights or only one? If you have two wires going to your rear and only one going to your front, then my guess is that your dynamo is not correctly grounded to your frame -- and is only grounded when the two wires to the rear (ground and +) are hooked up, and the rear light's internal grounding then grounds the frame which allows the front to work. Or, alternately, that your rear light is hooked up backwards and when connected, is shorting itself to the frame ground which causes the front light to not work. You can try switching the polarity of the rear light to see if this fixes things. Your LBS should be able to diagnose this easily with a multimeter. 

So at this point what you need to do is to lobby your congresscritters to amend the legislation that directs how the IRS treats commuting costs so that bike sharing is included. Note: to my chagrin, my employer participates in WageWorks but hasn't activated the bicycling option. So even if you have wageworks, you'd have to lobby to get bicycling added to it. As an aside, I really like the subsidized commuter bicycle purchase program that London has - since you can write-off your entire bike purchase and it's good for the local economy as you do it through your local bike shop. 

This is the Shimano PD-R9100, their highest end pedal. It uses two sets of adjustable bearing groups. It's designed to be as light and strong as possible but can also be fully adjusted and maintained. 

Are you sure your seat is at the right height? Your sensation of not getting full stroke could be because your seat is too low. It may also be because you are geared too high. Gearing lower and spinning is more efficient in terms of energy output and is easier with smaller/normal cranks. Longer cranks effectively increase the distance your feet have to travel each rotation and increase your leverage, in effect making it the equivalent of a smaller chainwheel so easier to go uphill, but make it harder to spin and harder to go faster. 

Unfortunately, bike sharing systems aren't included - and I don't think you could use the commuter transit plan (prepaid debit card) for those either, in fact your linked article makes it clear that they aren't: 

220 pounds (100kg) is not that heavy. At £459 or about US$600 retail, the Saracen is also not an inexpensive bike. It should be more than able to handle your weight unless you're doing very aggressive biking (such as hopping on and off curbs or doing wild jumps without the proper technique). Riding on rough roads is well within the design parameters of this "hybrid" bike. If your wheels are deforming**, it is likely either a manufacturing defect in the rim or your spokes were not properly adjusted/checked by the dealer. As @Orb notes, you should have also gotten a request from the dealer to come in after the first week to tighten things up as part of the new bike service. I would immediately go back and demand that it be fixed or replaced. I would myself insist on new wheels and insist that the spoke tension and hubs be properly checked before they are reinstalled. ** Note that I'm assuming your wheel (the metal bits) are deforming. Your description is vague. If your tire (the rubber bits) is bulging, then that could be caused by a local weakness in the tire wall. In either case, take it back to the shop to get it replaced. The UK has good retail trade laws so you should be well within your rights to demand resolution. ps. I do hope you bought it from a local bike shop rather than online. It's much harder to yell at people online, I've found. 

I think @suspendeduser's answer regarding tension is likely the right one, but another cause of this is that the brake outer or inner cable was kinked or crushed in the crash. This causes extra friction which causes the inner cable to pull out of the outer (or vice versa) when the brakes are applied. Solution: new brake outers and inners. Cost: about 20-40 eurodollars with labor at a bike store.
