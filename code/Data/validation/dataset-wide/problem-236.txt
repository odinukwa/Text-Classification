Critical factor for a common currency is the sheer amount of commercial and people interchange. There is absolutely no reason why having even a few days delay could not be handled via decentralized clearing house mechanisms. It is well over half a century now there is no currency in the world which is actually backed-up by anything "physical". All points in @TimB answer (which I upvoted) are valid but the last. There won't be any difficulty setting up a "purely virtual currency" beyond than the usual one: no privacy about how you spend your money. This has nothing to do with possible transaction delays. The only requirement for a stable currency is the belief it will be honored, somehow, somewhen. There has been a period (1975-1978) where shortage of actual minted coins in Italy spawned appearance of "minassegni" which were a kind of "parallel money" commonly accepted for the only reason people was convinced (mostly rightly) they could later spend them at no loss. In the same period also telephone tokens were exchanged as currency (nominal value 50Lit) for the same reason. OTOH if there is but a trickle of interchange reasons to keep a common currency would be much lessened and drawbacks enhanced (see below). Note that large good transactions, operated mainly by international firms (e.g.: oil, cereals, etc.) are handled via completely different channels and do not contribute to push to unify currency. Common currency is a necessity for highly integrated economies in order to avoid fragmentation due to customs duties and competitive devaluation. China currency is a good example of why loosely connected economies could want separate currencies; a good summary can be found here, it boils down to fact that keeping Yuan value low they can keep foreign prices low and help invade markets while, at the same time, making import more expensive thus helping internal market. It should be noted that (and this is a most important consideration) this can and will work mainly because China has a mostly closed economy relying on internal resources and thus not spending (much) money to import raw materials (how they acquire the few things they need abroad (mostly Africa) is a very interesting subject, but out of scope here). OTOH some economies, most notably European one, are tightly interconnected and mostly based on transformation of goods with a continuous interchange with other partners. In this situation stable common currency is needed to allow each single firm (even small ones) to plan sensibly the myriad of micro-transactions needed to actually produce something. Bottom line: Common Currency is a must for integrated economies and a hindrance when transactions are purely commercial and "not needed for production" (needed for revenue). This has nothing to do with the actual form currency has (electronic, paper, gold coins, whatever) and time needed to clear a transaction. 

Would they hear only verbalized thoughts? In that case they could, perhaps, escape utter insanity by practicing Zen meditation and thus shutting down their verbalized thoughts as much as possible. Probably failing to do so when not explicitly addressing someone would be regarded as very poor manners, something like shouting in a public place. I would suggest to "invent" helmets or something similar capable to shade "unwanted" thoughts. To really hear what people thinks is something I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Other possibility is to quickly develop some kind of "hive mind", so chatter is not anymore between individuals but between parts of the same "machinery". I wouldn't want to be part of that either. 

A two child/family cap will lead to a slow decline due to accidental life losses before spawning allowed children. Exact amount of correction needed is highly dependent on lifestyle (e.g.: a society with high percentage of base-jumpers will need a significantly higher "correction"). You can avoid a fixed amount by setting yearly a lottery with (right to start "building") a newborn child as prize; the amount is the dead-minus-born of previous year. Real problem, in our world is to enforce such limits; all attempts to date failed in a few years (India and China come to mind, but they are not alone). This is not a problem in your case because the "elders" solved it long ago ;) Other schema are possible, such as one child only "by birthright" and one more can be gained by "special feats", sport competitions, money or whatever else; keep the lottery to "even-out" the total. Specifics are dependent on your world. 

Having more than one planet in goldilocks zone is surely possible, after all our (real) Venus is just outside it and Mars is within. Having more on very similar orbits is more complex due to possibly disruptive interactions between planets. This may be easily overcome having several planets on the same orbit in L4/L5, the so called "Trojan" positions. These positions are very stable. You can easily have two "trains" of planets well within the habitable zone. 

It depends (as always) on specific circumstances but if question only is: "may active probe be more efficient to discriminate a heavily armed vessel from a civilian one?" the answer is YES! The ultimate probe is a real (looking) nuclear attack missile. This "probe" will look like a real threat and elicit the highest counter-measures available. In case these counter-measures prove insufficient (i.e.: we are dealing with a civilian ship) the "probe" can be stopped short of its destination, otherwise we already have a good assessment of military ship capabilities. This can be a bit "over the board", but is a viable example of an effective "active probe" ;) 

It heavily depends on Your personal definition of "art", but any known warlike culture has been (or "is") fond of music, songs (mostly ballades) and dance. Many of them also delight in poetry, sculpture, painting etc. ... although all these tend to be vastly mono-thematic ;) NOTE: You seem to be deceived by a single (apparent) counter-example: Spartans. They did not leave behind any major artifact, but: 

Religion is not (usually) neutral in Science/Technology development, but different religions may have different effects, even for quite "similar" religions. Christianity is often pointed out as a large hamper for everything "material", and that has surely been true throughout the Dark Ages. Different "flavors" of Islam produced both al-Khwarizmi, whose name is encoded in the word "algorithm" (reason is kind of funny: it seems a repeated phrase in medieval translations often explained a process starting with: "alkwrizmi says..." so the mathematician became synonym of process itself) and Caliph Umar who (legend narrates) ordered destruction of Alexandria Library saying: "If those books are in agreement with the Quran, we have no need of them; and if these are opposed to the Quran, destroy them." Ancient polytheisms never were a stop for scientific development, neither in Greece nor in India. While certain (specific!) flavors of monotheism can be blamed to have been a brake on scientific advance and technology (mainly insisting on importance of afterlife) it is unproven atheism is of any help. 

Addendum: As OP stated his interest in a no-season agriculture a few clarifications are in order: In our Earth (the only ecosystem we can study, to date) there are several different kind of plants (please note I'm not mother-tongue English, so I don't know the correct tecnical terms, correct me as needed); main categories are: 

First thing coming to mind is $2 H_2O <-> H_2 + O_2$ electrolysis is rather efficient and so are fuel cells. Probably by the time we get FTL such processes would be even better. Other chemical processes can be used if and when suitably efficient reversible conversions are developed (possible candidates include: ethylene, hydrocarbons and Aluminum oxides). They may provide a better storage, erg/gr or other practical benefits. I advise against electrical or kinetic storage because of high danger of immediate conversion to raw heat in case of any malfunction; OTOH chemicals can be stored safely in separate, jettisonable, containers outside the ship. If this is not a concern then a large flywheel on frictionless magnetic bearings is the best solution for both conversion efficiency and power/weight. 

Red/mammals meat differs from fish meat essentially because of its different content of fats. You can have your elves lack the enzymes needed to digest highly saturated and/or aromatic fats (cholesterol). That would be enough to give them good reasons to routinely avoid the stuff without preventing occasional usage. Occasional intake would mostly go unnoticed, but continue would result in diarrhea. 

It's difficult to have a stable climate like that, but you can get some cyclic approximation. Let's have a binary system with a large massive star and a smaller one circling it from far away (so that the orbit is several centuries). If your planet is in the Goldilock zone of the dwarf and it's orbit is almost perpendicular to giant-dwarf orbit then you could have what you ask, at least for half of the star's orbit, then the climates would slowly reverse. I mean: 

Not feasible. All methods proposed are fundamentally flawed. You can, up to a point, certify hardware. Some hardware include some "write-once" memories very difficult to "spoof". You can also "homologate" procedural software using signed signatures and be reasonably sure what's actually running in the hardware hasn't been tampered with. Unfortunately nothing of this is applicable to a reasonably complex A.I. Actual knowledge in a modern A.I. resides in data, this may be the weights defining a Simulated Neural Network or some Content Database or something yet different, but, in all cases, dynamic in nature and thus defying some simple(?) signing scheme. Normal I.D. cards rely on fact "hardware" is rigidly connected with "software" and there's no way, at least in the foreseeable future, to "reboot" some Natural Neural Network with a different "Operating System". The fact "Software" is not tightly linked to underlying hardware (and many layers ensure a program doesn't even know on which platform it is running, at least in many modern Programming Languages) is a game-changer. You can easily "clone" a program and have it run on many different hardware platforms; Should all of them have the same "I.D." card? Even if they started "identical" thy are bound to have different "experiences" and thus diverge, possibly in radical ways; At which point your "ID." should be invalidated? No. The only potentially viable approach is Python's Duck Typing. Prepare specific tests (they can be administered quite fast due to electronic speed) to test if a certain program can (still) perform a certain task. In the specific case this is equivalent to have the "policeman" connect some testing device to A.I. and have it pass a full fledged driving license exam. No other test would provide any reasonable answer. Note these problems are similar to what happens with on-line identification which is much less reliable then many people think (as the many "identity theft" cases testify) and essentially works well (when it works) by providing feedback to user about all transactions, so that they can be traced and stopped, not by preventing abuse. 

Can we setup an automated app sending a stream of fireballs from each and every smartphone in this world to AI site as fast as electronics allows? AI may be much faster then a cellphone, but I doubt it would be able to counter all of them firing at the same time (power of parallelism!). 

On top of @JDlugosz answer (upvoted) I would point out that, since the aliens are not allowed to make contact with "aborigens" for many reasons, including legal ones, there are a few concerns: 

What's wrong with Ptolemaic system? (beside the fact it's wrong in our universe, of course) Just replace the spherical Earth with a flat one and You're done. Other systems are possible (to invent), but this will give you the closest approximation to our sky. 

These kind of changes, if at all possible without defeating the whole purpose, would take much longer than scaling up a mouse to elephant size 

Plan has merits (we are surely too many by at least an order of magnitude), but is also very stupid (especially the part about saving people with a lot of money). 

How would your "perfect lie detector" handle this? Only way out would be to actually detect the "intention" to lie, but that is a bit over the board. Consider also that best liars actually convince themselves the lie is actually true (this is how certain individuals "resist" even drugs). This said a few considerations: 

If at all available such a DNA-preserving technology would be invaluable for tons of usages, including, but not limited to: 

Answer heavily depends on if all devices must be recovered or at least one of devices suffices. It would be very thoughtless of the character not to provide (at least) some redundancy. In case all are needed then it would be better to package them into a single unit: in this case I would go for making them a box (by gluing them together or sticking with tape) with some meaningful content (if the box is small enough can be some kind of jewel box containing some trinkets of small value). Specific depend on actual aspect and characteristics of said devices (are they recognizable on sight? easily damaged?). Rationale is the thing should look like some kind of bricolage handmade for a gift. In case the various devices are essentially copies and only one needs to be recovered it would be better to hide them in different and separated places: a few ideas (applicability depends on actual look): 

You'll have to organize your muscles, just like our ones, as tridimensional arrays of very small elements. In this condition your best bet is: 

To put it in another way: Earth is already almost the smallest planet that can have "Earth-like" gravity because it already has a fairly heavy nucleus (mostly Ni/Fe, but it also has a Si/Al part, so it's not really on boundary). To have smaller planets with same surface gravity you would need a nucleus almost completely composed by Fe, which is unlikely. To have Moon-size planets with Earth surface gravity you need a nucleus of very dense metal, very unlikely. Moving in the other direction, OTOH, is quite easy; if Earth would be fully composed of crust materials surface gravity would be about a fourth (or, to have the same gravity it should have a radius about six time larger). 

You cannot have the children controlling the parents. Penalizing children would have little or no effect in practice, since it would refrain only "conscientious" parents... which wouldn't be criminal in the first place, most likely. Criminals aren't such because they like to be "bad" (whatever it may mean). ALL of them are fully convinced to be justified in doing what they do and, in most of the cases, to be able to pull it through without punishment. They wouldn't be deterred by a possible disadvantage to kids (possibly still non-existent) may years from now. The other way around would work much better and have been used more than once in history: "collective responsibility" is a doctrine where responsibility of some action impacts immediately the whole family (medieval Japan was a particularly harsh example). This would put parents in position to control tightly relatives and children in order to avoid losing their job. It is a nasty system, but works, at least for some time (in Japan lasted centuries). 

Tarzan is the effect of a great deal of hand-waving for reasons too copious to bother detailing them. If memory assists, in the books he defeats bare-handed a gorilla (his step-father) by "re-inventing" a "double Elson" grip and thus breaking gorilla's neck. The lion was defeated with another "re-invention": the lasso built with a rope obtained entwining grass straws. While he was supposed to be very big, strong and trained from birth he was not supposed to be "superhuman" in any way. Not having used our skills for maaaaany generations we have lost a lot of strength, skill and endurance ( I know this is a bad reference, but I'm lazy ;) ). Just revive a Neanderthal or an ancient Australian and You'll have something "better than Tarzan" ;) 

If this "organization" really can do that there's no defense. Aside from fact "Country" would have to give away any attempt to Democracy (how can you vote for someone you do not know who he is?) there's the problem of line of command: someone has to convey the orders and to check they are executed. First step would be to take control of the mind of these individuals and then work from there. Having a completely insulated "government" (e.g.: contacts only via phone or other anonymizing device) has even bigger problems (it is much easier to hijack a phone line than a "mind") dealing mainly on how this "government" is formed; hard dynastic dictatorship is very likely.
