Ordinary vegetable oils of the type used for cooking will work but are not ideal. Over time they will gradually oxidise and may be colonised by bacteria, both of which can cause them to become acidic which can itself cause corrosion of the metal. Also vegetable oils can become gummy and sticky in quite a short period of time. Oils help to prevent corrosion by excluding moisture and oxygen from the metal surface. All metals will form a thin layer of oxide on the surface and oil etc can penetrate into this, helping to stabilise it and prevent destructive corrosion. It's also worth adding that carbon steels will naturally form a blue/grey layer of oxide on the surface and this is not necessarily a bad thing as it can provide a porous surface which can be pretty durable when stabilised with oil or wax. The best protective oil for a given situation will depend exactly on what you want to achieve. A light oil like 3-in-1 or gun oil is easy to apply and remove and can also be useful as a cleaning agent to remove wood resin etc from a blade. The downside is that its relatively low viscosity means that the protective film formed isn't very durable and so may not be ideal for long term storage or protection during use. Wax like renaissance wax or simply rubbing with a candle will give a more durable protective film but may need more care in applying to get a thorough coating. Wax can also help to lubricate saws. Another alternative is grease, this is easy, if potentially messy to apply but should give very good long term protection during storage as it can form a much thicker layer than oil. There are specialist greases for storing metal items which also contain active additional corrosion inhibiting ingredients, although these can be difficult to remove before use. Grease tends to be most useful if something needs to be stored for a significant time in bad conditions. There is also the consideration that if a tool is to be used for food preparation any protective coating should be reasonably food-safe. There are also a range of other substances such as silicone or PTFE based greases which can provide some protection from rusting and are available in spray on form or as impregnated cloth wipes. Some of these are intended to leave a dry film which is less prone to attracting dirt and grit and may be an advantage for tools such as folding knives with exposed moving parts and bearings. Overall I would say : 

I am assuming you go with adults. They are adults and you don't need to babysit them. Tell them what to take and what to not take, but gear inspection or packing for them? The %&$*? If someone is insane enough to go on a snowy 2500m high mountain in sandals (twice!), it is his problem. 1.) Make the trip interesting. This is by far the most important part of the thing. Nearly getting them killed - they will at least have stories to tell, even if they never go again. An easy 10km trip on the forest trail, sleeping there and going back will be likely boring enough they won't consider going out again. 2.) Too difficult, not enough food, not enough water? You will manage somehow. But don't go crazy. A 50 km trip in 2-3 days over few mountains (2000m height difference per day) is a nice starting experience if they are in reasonable shape, even if they aren't really used to walking. Just make sure an abort is possible at any time - "rescue" needs to be at max few km away. Plus possibly 10-20km walk of one person to get the car, or calling a cab or some other friends to get you all out of there. But if they barely manage to walk 5km on a flat surface without backpack, it is best to simply not go on an overnight trip yet. Find a nice easy 2hr walk to destination and practice on that. 3.) For a short trip, food is mostly irrelevant. 2-3 days hiking without any food won't kill them, but they will be hungry, tired and easily annoyed. Won't be a nice experience for anyone. Ask them to grab sugary snacks, to eat breakfast before you go and pack a few sandwiches and some fruit. Tell them to not take fatty and salty snacks (chips, flips etc). Water and other drinks are more important. Ask everyone to bring about 2l/day. Mostly water, maybe a bottle of a sports drink. This is also why trip should be short - 1 week requires tons of water or searching for streams. Other stuff they need to take? A towel, spare clothes, medical plasters (preferably blister ones). Sleeping bag depends on the area and weather. In spring/summer can usually go on a trip without and not freeze. If they take it, they should have a light and small one for spring/summer. Not a winter one. Too warm, too heavy. It is very likely they will try to take too much stuff on the first trip or forget something. Put a lot of emphasis that every kilo counts and that you will all stink together :) You should pack all they do, bandages and other wound treating stuff (disinfection, soothing etc), extra chocolate in the morning to get them going, tent of course. Maybe flashlight, compass, map (phone can replace these 3, as long as it is charged :) ). 4.) On the trip, make sure you all stay together at all time. Never give permission to go ahead or stay behind, unless the destination is in sights. Make the first stop early enough, say after 30 minutes. Ask them how it is going for now, and ask them to check their feet if there is anything red. Put plaster on the area. Then stop every 2-3 hours for several minutes and check their condition. Make sure you are setting up tent early enough. 

Number 2 is how a candle works. Similarly a diesel fueled primus stove. What I would do is to put a wick into the fuel. Use a piece of fiberglass paper or glass wool, that makes a nice wick that lasts forever. You could then mix a small quantity of a low flashpoint liquid (e.g. ether, lighter fluid, -40C or acetone, -18C) with your ethanol. That way you can light the vapor with a spark, that will heat the wick, which will in turn heat the liquid above the flash point. Be careful: Gasoline is horribly dangerous due to it's low flame point and it's toxicity. You'll be much safer just using a match to heat the wick, but on the other hand not being able to light the oven with a spark with a steel lighter might be a safety issue in a survival situation. At first the fire will be small and limited to the wick, but once the liquid heats, the flame will become much more powerful. 

Each fuel has a flash point. Below that point, the fumes are not dense enough to sustain a flame. You can find a table here: $URL$ And a nice video here: $URL$ Ethanol : 16.6 °C (61.9 °F) Gasoline : −43 °C (−45 °F) Diesel : >62 °C (144 °F) Below that temperature, the fuel will not burn if you touch the surface with a flame. If you stick a burning match into diesel fuel below 62C, it will go out. If you do so above this temperature, the diesel will start to burn. Now you have 2 choices: 

Heat the entire volume of the fuel above the flash point. Continuously heat a small part above the flash point. 

The needle of a compass is often made from a magnetically very soft material. It is very easy to re-magnetize the needle. This does not happen normally, because the needle always aligns with the external field. Luckily this happens in such a way that the magnetization of the needle is aligned with that of the external magnet. In this case nothing will happen. If you would hold the needle in place, the needle would change direction (N and S poles will change place) If you quickly touch a compass with a strong magnet, the needle might not be able to rotate away fast enough. In this case it will be re-magnetized and your compass will point southwards in the future. If that happens, you can set it back the same way. I have seen this many times (I work with magnetic materials and use a compass to align them.) I don't know if an expensive compass is any different (I don't think so), but the cheap ones I use can be flipped with a permanent magnet. The bearing is very fragile, and applying a field vertically can break it. I would not store a compass with anything magnetic close by. If you see that the compass needle is attracted to some item, it is too close. Normally 10 cm are far enough. And it does not hurt to check if the compass has flipped N and S poles.
