Something curious is happening in some corners of fundamental physics these days, and I am wondering if professional philosophers of science are fully aware of this, or else why there is not more quality contribution to the discussion from those who would actually be trained and qualified to do so: Namely in some corners of fundamental physics, physicists are starting to stop being physicists and start being all interested in discussing philosophy. Not with philosophers, though, but among themselves, and in fact while at the same time publically proclaiming that "philosophy is dead". I am thinking of much of the discussion that goes with the term "multiverse". Some of this is science, but for intrinsic reasons there is not too much science to be done about a "multiverse" (as Bert Schellekens, who arguably was the first to point out the bit of science that is available, already pointed out). This discussion is instead squarely in the territory of philosophy, much like discussion of phenomena such as "conciousness" etc. which arguably might be part of science one day, but currently are not (and in fact you don't have to look long for physicists trying to make the connection to that, too). Nevertheless, this discussion is all the hype in some public media and the physics-web sphere, see for instance here. A kind of inverse Giordano Bruno complex is getting hold of part of the community. My trouble with this is not so much the discussion in itself. It is potentially interesting, such as speculations about the nature of conciousness are potentially interesting, -- while similarly out of reach for present science. My trouble is this: first, I find the intellectual discipline in some of the discussion lacking, one can tell that physicists are not being trained to enter such territory. Second, I find it disturbing that this discussion crops up in the physics arXive-s. I'd be happy to find it in the philosophy journals when I do want to go look for it. In short, it seems there has rarely been such a strongly felt need among the fundamental pyhsics community for some help from the philosophy departments, and at the same time this help is not happening, or if it is, it is not being recognized. In the tradition of this discussion forum of asking more or less obvious "Why?"-questions, let this be my why-question: why did that happen? Notice that I am not asking why physicists are talking about the multiverse, I know that quite well. I am intersted in this phenomenon of the sociology of science, that we have physicists start getting all interested in philosophy while at the same time proclaiming that "philosophy is dead". Apparently, there is some lack of cross-community communication here. 

The idea of a concept (notion) which implies its own existence is due to Descartes, but it is not the Cogito, ergo sum, but it's his ontological proof of the existence of god: "There is a notion which implies its own existence, and that concept is god." This became, incidentally, the pivotal point in Hegel's Science of Logic, the transition of the subjective notion into objective reality by necessity. See ยง1528, ยง1529 at the very end of the section Subjectivity and ยง1530, ยง1531 at the very beginning of the following section Objectivity, where it says: 

It is correct that in homotopy type theory two terms x1, x2 : X of type X may be different, while being equivalent, as witnessed by an equivalence or homotopy between them. Since under BHK we may think of x1 and x2 as being proofs of a proposition -- namely the proposition represented by the (-1)-truncation isInhab(X) of X, this means that these two proofs are thereby equivalent. Regarding the discussion in the comments above, notice that one needs to distinguish here the type X from its (-1)-truncation isInhab(X). Not every two terms of the former need to be connected by a homotopy, this will only be the case if X is a connected type. On the other hand, by construction any two terms of isInhab(X) are equivalent, reflecting the fact that this is really a mere proposition. Finally regarding the statement that homotopy is "analytic, in that the paths are built out of points": this is really only true in the particular presentation of homotopy theory by topological spaces up to weak homotopy equivalence. Arguably more "direct" is the presentation by infinity-groupoids which, specifically when thought of as Kan complexes. In this presentation homotopies are "elementary" and not "built out of points". 

There is a remarkable proposal by William Lawvere, for connecting transcendental philosophy and theoretical physics. Lawvere proposes that the categories in the version in which Hegel presents them in the Science of Logic are faithfully and usefully formalized in categorical logic (a mathematical term! which happens to fit well the use in philosophy) as systems of (co)-reflective subcategories (in the mathematical sense! of category theory) of some ambient topos. The resulting structure Lawvere called a cohesive topos (following Hegel's discussion of "cohesion" in the Philosophy of Nature), and he indicates how such "gros toposes" may serve as Toposes of laws of motion for physics. It is possible to refine this a little more to arrive at a concept of cohesive infinity-toposes. In a book-in-progress titled Differential cohomology in a cohesive infinity-topos (web, pdf) I claim to work out how a considerable chunk of modern physics naturally finds its formalization in terms of such categories, see in particular the introductory section 1.2 on Classical field theory via Cohesive homotopy types (web, pdf). See here for pointers to Lawvere's proposal for formalizing idealistic philosophy in terms of categorical logic. See here for pointers to Lawvere's work on building a foundation of (classical continuum) physics based on this. See here for details on how the mathematical formalization of "the categories" according to Hegel's Science of Logic proceeds. For more background and survey see also the beginning of my lecture slides on Synthetic Quantum Field Theory. 

One may neatly axiomize "similarity" in modal type theory, which is type theory equipped with an idempotent (co-)monad D. This being idempotent, it necessarily acts by "projecting out" some details of the type. Hence given two types X and Y, then asking whether they are similar in that they are equal after forgetting the details projected out by P is asking wehther D(X) = D(Y). For instance in a homotopy type system equipped with a shape modality (some details on what this means are here, then all types have the interpretation of differential geometric spaces, and the shape operator forgets all the differential geometric structure and remembers just the homotopy theoretic shape (aka weak homotopy type). For instance the circle S^1 and the cyclinder S^1 x [0,1] are different types in this context, as they are not diffeomorphic, but clearly they are similar in some sense. One such sense is that they have the same homotopy-theoretic shape: Shape(S^1) = Shape(S^1 x [0,1]). Of course a different kind of modal operator encodes a different kind of similarity this way. But this makes very good sense: a notion of similarity depends of specifying the intended "mode" of similarity. 

It is clear that there should be such a hierarchy, and the real question would be if we have more than a hand-wavy way of establishing and reasoning about it. Already the traditional foundation of mathematics in some flavor of set theory is such that even the simplest mathematical statements are only in principle expressible fully formally; and when it comes to traditional mathematical foundations of physics this is so very much primitive or else non-existent that any discussion about what its hierarchy of additional axioms is appears to be lacking substance in its topic. For instance in the other comments we hear about the idea of propositions becoming physical laws if interpreted with physical constants inserted they become true, but that seems more a design criterion for what a formal incarnation of laws of physics should be, than what they actually are in the textbooks. There is an attempt to improve on this state of affairs by producing an actual and useful foundation of physics in intuitionistic logic, or rather in intuitionistic type theory, viz topos theory. This goes back to William Lawvere, who has articles titled for instance "Toposes of laws of motion" where an actual axiomatization of physics along such lines is attempted/proposed. From there to statements about the universal attractiveness of gravity it is still some way, though. Since the foundations of mathematics itself saw a kind of revolution by (intuitionistic) homotopy type theory in which it is possible to actually and usefully formalize non-trivial parts of modern mathematics, it is possible to re-examine Lawvere's apporach and ask for an actual and useful formalization of modern physics by adding a hierarchy of axioms to homotopy type theory. It turns out that there is a simple but powerful set of axioms that goes at least a long way towards this goal, which, following Lawvere, are called axioms of "cohesion". With these axioms added to the bare minimum foundations of homotopy type theory, it turns out that there is an actual and useful formalization of classical/pre-quantum local field theory. I discuss this in some detail in an article Classical field theory via Cohesive homotopy types that goes with a talk at the Conference on Type Theory, Homotopy Theory and Univalent Foundations in Barcelona in 2013. More emphasis of how this proceeds by adding layers of foundational axioms to the bare minimum foundations is in section 2 "Modal type theory" of the companion article Quantization via Linear homotopy types. Regarding the question about the law (of Einstein gravity) that all matter (and indeed all energy) gravitationally attracts, there are some comments on how laws of generally covariant Einstein gravity arise in such foundations of physics towards the end of Quantum gauge field theory in Cohesive homotopy type theory with Mike Shulman, following the discussion on the nLab at general covariance -- Formalization in homotopy type theory. From here to formally proving the universal law of attraction is still some way to go, but at least it is clear already that and how this is a statement sitting in a hierarchy of statements which starts with some substrate of logical laws at the very bottom and increasingly picks up laws of more physical nature as one adds more of the system of adjoint modalities that characterizes cohesion. 

This is the very topic of Hegel's Science of Logic, highlighted neatly in the introduction Allgemeiner Begriff der Logik. To some extent he says that: yes, ultimately it is circular, but no, this does not mean that there is no way to get to the heart of the matter anyway. On the other hand, few are able to follow the path he suggests. 

While not very explicit, I suppose we may take the singular Idea in the second sentence as being Hegel's concept. Maybe Hegel found it too obvious to need highlighting that where he speaks of "Idea" he speaks in Plato's tradition? But then, Hegel notoriously has his ideosyncrasies, so I am left wondering. Could anyone provide me with pointers to passages that would further clarify the (intended or perceived) relation between Hegel's Idea and Plato's Ideas either in the primary or in the secondary literature? 

Hegel famously speaks of the idea in the third section of his Doctrine of the Notion, this playing a central role in his system. It seems natural to suppose a close relation to what is traditionally referred to as Plato's doctrine of ideas (or theory of forms). I am wondering where in print anyone (preferably Hegel himself) would have expanded on the relation between Hegel's Idea and Plato's Ideas. I see that in Hegel's "Lectures on the History of Philosophy" in the section on Plato there is this paragraph, which might be read as being about this relation: 

You should beware that the term "grand unified theory" (GUT), even if it sounds very general, has a very specific meaning in theoretical high energy physics: it refers very specifically to models that replace the gauge group of the standard model of particle physics by one big simple Lie group (in the technical sense of "simple"). For an excellent technical but expositional discussion of what GUTs really are see Baez-Huerta 09. For an excellent account of why physicists think this is a good idea see Witten 02. I expect that if you read that article (which is notes from a public talk, so should be readable for laymen, to some extent) to the end, you will at least feel an inkling of what makes GUTs fascinating intellectually, and it is not related to any theism. On the other hand, what I guess you are really thinking of in your message are not so much GUTs in the sense as used in theoretical physics, but rather are what physicists call theories of everything (TOEs). That terminology, too, is usually used in physics with more specific meaning than its natural language meaning would suggest, namely it refers foremost to unifications of the standard model of particle physics with quantum gravity, but it is used more generally than the term "GUT", at least, by physicists. Most people would think that it is quite obvious why intellectually one is tempted to look for a TOE: given two different theories of nature, the standard model of particle physics on the one hand and Einstein gravity on the other, which describe different aspects of fundamental nature, it seems more natural to wonder how they might be two aspects of one single theory than to be content with having two incompatible theories of fundamental nature. Therefore on a superficial level I would tend to outright reject the suggestion that questions of theism have the first bit to do with the search for ever more fundamental theories of physics. On the other hand, on a more subtle level I could agree that there is some relation, but I am not sure if we'd meet on that level. But let's see. So one thing that is curious about the idea that there could be a TOE is that, at least the way it is usually imagined, it would, by definition of its common meaning, be a piece of theoretical physics hence of mathematics, really, which "in principle" encodes all of tangible reality. When taken fully seriously, such a state of affairs would be a realization of a strong form of idealism, namely it would mean that "the world" in the end is pure thought, to the extent that it is embodied in a physical theory, which after all is, one imagines, a bunch of mathematical axioms and deduction rules. The existence of a TOE would hence realize a form of idealism as the statement that the world is intelligible, and intelligible to the very end. Such a strong form of idealism might remind one of Hegel's system -- as it did remind David Hilbert in a famous public lecture a century ago, who there ponderns theories of everything as Weltgesetze and reflects on whether it might indeed be possible to derive the whole world from pure thought (he ends up being scared away from this though, see the pointers here) . Now in Hegel's system, of course, all is unified, the physical laws of nature, the monotheistic god, the spirit, the spirits, the ideas, the whatnot. If you'd argue that physicist's hope in the existence of a TOE is closely related to a theism as in Hegel's system, than I would actually be inclined to follow you, but probably you don't (?) What is curious in this respect is that theoretical physicists these days, the more fond they are of the idea of reducing all of reality to physical theory, hence to pure thought, the more dismissive they tend to be of philosophy (links). That's ironic and, I think, a sign of intellectual weakness that in the face of what is looking like a grand unification of physics with (idealistic) philosophy, neither camp recognizes the other. But apparently the world spirit has to still work on this... ;-) 

To maybe put the interrelation between these three rules into perspective, it might be worthwhile to notice that from the point of view of categorical logic, the categorical semantics of a modality (with all three rules N, K and M) is a closure operator, hence a (co-)monad on the system of propositions/of types. Rule M then interprets as the (co-)unit of the (co-)monad. This gives a usefully "global" picture of what the interrelation between these three rules is, or maybe what it should most naturally be taken to be. In particular it means that โก(โกAโA). This monadic perspective on modal logic has proven quite fruitful as of late. Generalized from propositions to type theory it leads to modal type theory which is sometimes called computational type theory due to the intimate and practically relevant application of modalities in type theories to encode computational effects in functional programming. One might view the wealth of these applications as evidence that regarding the rules N, K and M in their correct interaction as the encoding of a monad is their natural raison d'รชtre. Lawvere had pointed out that considering modalities in this sense related to each other such as to make for systems of "adjoint modalities" has profound implications on the re-reading of parts of philosophy to which application of modal logic had never been dreamed of, namely Lawvere points out that adding axioms for systems of adjoint modalities to the intuitionistic type system serves to usefully(!) formalize the "unities of opposites" that infamously govern Hegelian metaphysics. Recently with the advent of homotopy type theory this monadic perspective on modalities has brought about some developments that seem fairly dramatic compared to the developments in modal logic (to which this still reduces on (-1)-truncated types). In cohesive homotopy type theory we add a triple of adjoint modalities to the logic/the type system and find that this provides a formal context in which a maybe surprisingly large bit of modern higher geometry may be usefully axiomatized. All this is only possible with reading the rules for N,M,K in the "natural way" (which hopefully is the way that the Wikipedia article describes).
