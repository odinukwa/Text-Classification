Well, the answer is a fairly simple one, and certainly one that the social contract theorists anticipated. There have been only very few instances in which human beings have actually gotten together and signed a written contract—in keeping with the relatively Western nature of this philosophy, the Magna Carta is often cited as the canonical example. In the rest of cases, indeed the majority of cases, the consent to this social contract is assumed to be implicit, or tacit. The argument usually goes something like this: By virtue of choosing to remain in the territory which is under a particular social contract, the individual has tacitly given consent to be governed by that society and therefore give up his/her individual rights as required to gain the larger benefits of that society. In fact, the argument goes, this tacit consent (the ability of people to "vote with their feet") is what gives the government its legitimacy. To answer your question more specifically, I'll focus on the writings of John Locke, arguably the most influential and widely-known of the social contract theorists. Locke says that simply walking along the roads of a particular jurisdiction is tantamount to tacit, or implied, consent to the laws of that government. A person agrees to obey the laws of a society while it is living within the territory of that society. He says that this explains why resident aliens are obligated to obey the laws of whatever state in which they reside, even though they are not naturalized citizens of that society. This obligation no longer holds when they return to their country of origin, but it necessarily attaches while they take up residence in that particular jurisdiction. And the idea of property ownership (a recurring theme throughout Locke's philosophical views) becomes important here as well. If a person inherits property, then that works to create an even stronger bond between the individual and the commonwealth. The idea is that the original owner of that property agreed to place this property permanently under the jurisdiction of the commonwealth or society, and that by inheriting this property, the inheritor also inherits the obligation to follow the laws of that society. So when children accept the property of their parents, they also tacitly consent to the jurisdiction of the commonwealth and agree to abide by the rules of the social contract. For more on this line of thought, I highly recommend picking up a copy of John Locke's seminal work, The Second Treatise of Government. It's a relatively short little book (as these things go), and well worth a read for anyone curious about the nature of governmental sovereignty and implied consent. 

But beyond that, it appears that your confusion (and the confusion of whomever wrote the article you are quoting) stems mainly from the notion that atheism (or the rejection of organized religion) implies relativism, absent or beyond its humanist affiliations. That is also quite incorrect (albeit quite a common fallacy that religious scholars succumb to). The flaw lies in thinking that the only possible source for an objective morality is from [a] God. While that's certainly one possible source, and even a good source, it's far from the only possible source. Humanists, as I hinted above, would argue that human rationality, intuition, and logic are the sources for morality, and since all humans share these faculties, such a moral framework would be objectively shared across all humanity. There is an entire world of philosophers who don't necessarily believe in the existence of a supreme being, yet believe in objective morality. The one who makes this position most persuasively is probably Shelly Kagan, a contemporary moral philosopher. And other philosophers have even argued (this is Plato's famous Euthyphro dilemma) that objective morality cannot be based on God, even if both are granted to exist. 

Ironically, just as Nietzsche had observed elsewhere (and as some readings of the work might claim, was attempting to demonstrate through the "Maxims and Arrows" section), writers are remembered primarily for and by such simple aphorisms. The well-known American rapper, Kanye West, even includes a paraphrase in his hit song Stronger  (again, requoted without the phrase that prefaces it): 

The justification that an argument is true because it is "too strange to be made up" definitely sounds like an appeal to the credibility of the speaker. It sounds to me like you're saying "regardless of whether or not you think I'm a liar, I couldn't  have possibly  made this  one up!" It's not a particularly strong or convincing argument, mind you, but I think it is clearly an appeal to the ethos of the speaker rather than an appeal to the inherent logic of the argument or an attempt to invoke strong emotions on the part of the listener. 

So in the passage you quote, Nietzsche appears to be praising empirical observation of the world as a superior form of inquiry compared to Platonic idealism. In fact, recall his assertion that the "will to power" ethic permeates nature, a fact that he arrived at by observation and perspective, just like the physicists analyze the world. But it's more complicated than that. Nietzsche doesn't consider himself to be a physicist—far from it. That's what the initial phrase regarding the "five or six minds" is referencing. He's basically saying that, of all my readers, it will probably occur to a small number of them that neither the domain of physics or philosophy is immune from turning into "an interpretation and exegesis of the world". Just like idealism and philosophy, physics is ill-suited to function as a grounded domain of inquiry because it, too, is vulnerable to regressing into mere interpretation and polemic. Even physics is all perspective, "and not a world-explanation". He wants nothing at all to do with positivism. In fact, he's rather dismissive of what he perceives as the arrogance of natural scientists in assuming that they have the answers to the world. Ultimately, this is the nihilism for which Nietzsche is famous. If even at the fundamental nature of observation (physics), we're deluded by interpretations and descriptions of the world, as opposed to causal explanations of the events and phenomena that occur, we will be unable to separate ourselves from our description or interpretation of these events. As such, "truth" becomes simply 

But the argument doesn't seem to fit that pattern. Is the quoted argument fallacious and, if so, what fallacy does it commit? 

I don't think this is the best approach to tackling the cosmological argument. The Kalām version of the argument seems immune to the counter-argument by design. It's less concerned with "What was there before the Universe?" and more concerned with: 

What this remarkable statement says is that the British government systematically and sustainedly denied the people of the colonies to what it calls "unalienable Rights" endowed by man's Creator. Because the previous Government was not constructive, but "destructive of these ends", it became necessary for the colonies "to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with [Britain]". It's not explicitly stated here, but the colonies did not have the power to alter the previous Government and therefore was left only with the power to abolish it. It appears that the Southern states saw the US Government in much the same light as the Founding Fathers saw the British Government. It seems that Lincoln did not see things that way. His most well-known, and perhaps best, statement of his position on the war comes from his Gettysburg Address: 

Unintentionally ironic. This is a restatement of the Gettier problem, if I understand correctly. The main thrust is that a person may have justified, true belief, but not really know something. That does not seem relevant to your question, since you don't actually seem to promote the JTB formula. I'm reminded of the BBC special in which a woman was convinced that the host (Derren Brown) had a fool-proof system for selecting horses. It turns out the woman was the victim of survivorship bias and that the "System" was a hoax. What strikes me as interesting about the show is that there are people who have the ability to successfully gamble on horse races, but it would be harder to convince skeptics of the ability since it's nowhere near perfect. Rather, the ability has more to do with expert risk management than some mystical ability to know which horses will win. 

Since the argument is only useful for a monotheistic god ("than which nothing greater can be thought"), it would be surprising if a non-monotheistic thinker would propose such an argument. Since monotheism is primarily found in the West, we should expect Ontological argument to most often observed in Western philosophy. But I'm wondering why you don't cut to the chase and search for non-Western examples of an "introspective God". It's also not clear to me why the Ontological argument's absence (as opposed to other attempts to prove God's existence) in non-Western philosophy would be helpful to proving your conjecture. 

As a Christian, I would argue that God (and God alone) is worthy of my worship whether or not He does miracles, changes my life for the best, or allows me to experience eternal happiness. That He did this is an undeserved favor to humanity. The standard Christian belief conforms to what Paul of Tarsus once wrote: 

In both cases, it seems that there are ethical implications that go along with the metaphysical ones. (I notice you want to exclude the metaphysical question so the answer so far might not be helpful.) For Pantheists, duty to God extends to a duty to all of creation and therefore to other people as well. Leibniz makes this consideration his final point: 

Pascal expands this point by saying that people choose different methods, not because some like to be happy and others don't, but because all are pursuing a better life. Over a lifetime of bad decisions, suicide may seem the happiest choice. For both men, the context of the idea is ethics. 

Now this statement strikes me as perfectly apt, but not sufficiently grounded. I suspect that it's correct, but there isn't enough there to know. So is the Incompleteness Theorem a "cheap trick" or is it a serious argument that propels philosophy forward? (I presume that the theorem is perfectly valid and valuable in mathematics where it originated.) 

After this, he proceeds to argue that philosophical analysis of the reliability of our senses and the uniformity of nature fails: 

Not at all an answer to your question, but a personal opinion: Nietzsche (like Tolstoy and Pascal) seems far more a product of his time than Plato. He seems like a niche philosopher who appeals to specific personalities and cultures more than to others. His way of looking at the world doesn't appeal to me and therefore I have a difficult time following his lines of reasoning. Pascal is the opposite for me: I get where he's coming from although I know many other people don't. Meanwhile, both Plato and Aristotle, who come from opposite sides of the deductive/inductive spectrum, seem to hold up well from many people. I have no direct evidence for this assertion, however. 

And I think that's as good an answer as exists. Whatever or whoever brought us into existence did so on its own terms and who are we to argue? 

I'm not sure what translation you are using, but the question you marked at (3) doesn't seem properly translated. Paul Shorey translated the question as: 

Many of the traditional solutions to the dilemma turn on some conception of a monotheistic God. I'm not sure how many, if any, will work for secular ethics. While it might be tempting to simply say that ethical codes define goodness, we are then forced to ask the meta-question: 

This is a very difficult passage for me, and I'd imagine for many believers. It seems that God gives some people the ability to recognize him and does not give "the secret of the kingdom of God" to others. It seems that God may be hidden in plain sight. Make of that what you will.
