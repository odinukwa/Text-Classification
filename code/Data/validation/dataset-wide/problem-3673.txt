Shin splints are commonly caused by imbalances in muscles and supporting tissue. Try these for strengthening and mobility. 1) Alphabet with your feet focusing on rotating your ankles. 2) Towel toe curls or picking up change with your toes. 3) Heel raises. 4) Calf raises. More detail about the above can be found at Exercises to Prevent Shin Splints. For stretching, use these Calf Stretches. Do following a run for 3 minutes to a side in order to lengthen the calf muscles. Good luck. 

Definitely think you can go sub 25 minutes. The key with running is "Accumulated fitness". The more often you run and the more consistently (say 4 days a week for an entire year), the better you will become. So how do you get there? 1) Run often - minimum 4 days a week but slowly see if you can fit 5 or even 6 days a week into your schedule 2) Run consistently - run every week. Don't skip. 3) Add variety - vary your pace, vary your distance, add intervals, add distance, etc. 4) Extend your long run - try to get to 90 minutes by adding 5 minutes a week. Once you get to 90 minutes, try to make the run faster. One week make the last 5 minutes medium. Next week make the last 10 minutes medium, etc. Good luck! Let us know how you progress. P.S. I have worked with runners of all age groups. Anyone that has 1) desire to improve 2) discipline in training and diet and 3) even a small bit of athletic talent can improve. I have seen the following as good age goals for male "non-runners" under 30 - 21:00 30 - 40 - 24:00 40 - 50 - 25:00 50+ - 26:00 

I had simiar issues until I discovered towel toe curls. Simply take off your shoes and socks and stand over a towel. Place the toes of your right foot on the towel and keep your heel on the floor. Use your toes to "curl" the towel back towards your body. It is like you are pulling the towel towards you using your toes. Do 50 reps to the right foot. Do 50 reps to the left foot. Do every day for 2 weeks and then every other as maintenance. Good luck. 

Uh, no, they aren't worth your ROI. The main purposes I see in Vibram Shoes is to strengthen the supporting lower leg muscles and to change your running gait to put you more on your toes. Vibram shoes are training tools within themselves. The shoes should be worn progressively similarly to how you would progress a workout -> maybe 10 minutes a day this week and then 15 minutes a day the next week and then maybe a 15 minute run in the 3rd week, etc. You get the idea. For running they improve form (when properly & slowly introduced) and improve supporting structures (ankles, ligaments, calves, etc.). So for weight-lifting ONLY, I see them as being nothing more than a conversation piece between sets. 

Great question. Progressive loading is the best strategy. In other words, start easy and increase load (difficulty, stress) as you gain strength. In my experience, it is best to train each pathway independently when possible, at least at first. Part of this reason is that lactate (anaerobic conditioning) interferes with the production of the aerobic enzyme. Would recommend aerobic to be the base of everything you do with anaerobic load to gradually increase. For example, in week 1 of training, perhaps only do 10-15% anaerobic work such as hill sprints or suicides. As you get closer to key competitions, gradually build the anaerobic portion up to maybe 50% of total work. The aerobic conditioning will always be the key though. As the season progresses, mixing the two and game scrimmages will allow for better development. It is crucial that hard days are followed by easy days as well. The Creatine Phosphate system can be developed at all times of the season. The key to ATP-CP development is the work (7-10 seconds max) and rest periods (3-5 minutes). 3 great ways to develop ATP-CP? 1) 60m accelerations to top speed. Turn around, walk back, wait 3 minutes before doing another. 2) Short hill sprints up a steep incline lasting no more than 7-10 seconds. Jog back, rest 3 minutes. 3) Deadlifts at 85% max with 2-3 reps. KEY TO NOT GAINING MASS is to rest 5 minutes between sets and no more than 2 or 3 sets. This exercise does wonders to also gain speed endurance. EVERY athlete can benefit from this regardless of sport and it can be performed 3 times a week. 

If you added some hand weights to the floor exercise he suggested that would change the difficulty quickly. Trap muscle are weird, in that may times you have to try to squeeze them intentionally. Some gyms have little pictures on the machinery to indicate which muscles group should be activated by using that machine. That's a start if you really want to be out of your home when doing these exercises. (Workout at home are so tough to do consistently). In the process of strengthening the traps you will also help your posture I think, because I can't think of 1 exercises that uses the traps where you do not need to properly sit and arch your back (versus hunch). As for the laptop thing, maybe a USB mouse to keep you from needing to hunch towards the trackpad. Silly me, started thinking about LATS, not TRAPS. I'll leave my previous post intact, but as a revision, go to this site for targeted exercises with pictures for tons of muscles and muscle groups. 

I agree with Nathan. Form is very important with squats when you're starting out, or you'll never make it to higher weights. However, if your ankle flexbility is low, it could be better to work on this directly. Your calves and shins should be worked on, and you need to get better with plyometric/ballistic movement. Being able to vertically jump high is rather dependent on ankle flexibility because that allows you to get lower (i.e. like in a squat) but in the right position to jump. When you can go from standing to a crouch (hands out in front of you), without falling backwards, and without your heels ever coming off the ground, then you have gain good ankle flexibility. 

By running do you mean jogging or sprinting? If you jog, you rarely need to use a full motion swing of the arms, and really you're not supposed to fully open your arms (extended elbow) at any time. Your elbow is most bent, opening a small number of degrees. This is part of why the effect is less detrimental, because you are not putting an abnormal force at the end of a lever that usually is not there. Theoretically speaking, wrist weight are better than hand weights because they are closer to the vertex of your elbow. 

I haven't read on oxygenation, but have heard the term. I actually bought a heart-rate/pulse monitor watch about a week ago. It does NOT include the chestband thing, just wrist only taking over your heart-rate. Using it during a basic workout I notice more calories registering as burned, vs if someone calculated calories burned from the exercises I did. This is to be expected as calculating calories burned from the exercises you do can only take into account the the "work" (force/distance) you do or energy (power/time) expended by by using power (work/time). The best way to test the efficiency of these heart-rate monitors is to just get someone to measure it. I'm not sure if machines like the blood-pressure measurer at Walmart also give you your pulse rate, but that would be one way to measure. You could also compare by using the heart-rate indicators on a PreCor (elliptical) machine at a gym. Those machines take your age and weight as a way to approximate measurements, and they have handles to hold to check the rate. Start walking, check the rate on the PreCor, then the Watch. Speed up and get a second reading. The accuracy or Calories burned as measured by heart-rate on the watches is based on the number of times you "check in" with your heart-rate. Meaning if you check-in before the start of your workout with a 78, then it assumes you to be at 78 until you enter another reading. Thus, in a hour, even if you ran a mile, it won't show you burning a lot of calories. I'm not sure of the chestband types have constant monitoring, but if they do (again) a comparison with a PreCor measurement of calories burned would let you know if you have the accuracy of a more expensive machine 

Would definitely agree with Eric, and I would have added on to his comment but I'm new on here :) If you're isolating and smashing your biceps several times a week you should ask yourself if you're giving yourself ample time to fully recover - I had a similar problem in years gone by but I was also making it worse because my body was building up a kind of tolerance to exercises that I was repeating over and over again. Essentially I was becoming better at performing that exercise, but it wasn't giving me an overall benefit. That's why I advocate compound exercises, or mixing up routines - I won't just focus on my biceps for 30 minutes. A couple more things... While chinups do use chest you're mainly targeting your arms (triceps and forearms as well as biceps), your shoulders and your back. It could be you've gained mass in your chest and arms and you need to compensate for that - you're heavier than you used to be. I find chinups as well as dip reps can fluctuate a lot depending on how heavy you are, whether that's muscle mass or fat. Try doing some seated and / or upright rows to strengthen your shoulders and back or, if you want to burn fat and increase your cardio resistance, jump on the rowing machine and alternate the intensity. Also don't obsess over protein too much - obviously it's important but good quality carbs are so often neglected these days. You're going nowhere without decent carbs - that's the fuel powering your workouts. Supplements do help, but nothing will beat a good quality diet. Good luck 

Diet - reduce your overall calories - to lose weight you need to expend more calories on a daily basis than you ingest. Diet - reduce the amount of bad fats. Diet - reduce carbs in general, especially fast metabolising sugary carbs - the type of carbs you find in soft drinks, biscuits, cakes etc. Diet - eat more protein, slow GI carbs (vegetables & oats) and good fats. Diet - make sure you drink plenty of water. Diet - some people are more susceptible to gaining weight from lactose and / or gluten. Limiting both of these in my diet helped me in the past. Sleep - it's crucial so make sure you get a good night. Whenever I don't have enough sleep, especially over several days, I always carry more weight in my abdomen. Don't over exercise - when you exercise you raise your corisol levels. Cortisol isn't an enemy, but too much does influence weight, again especially around the abdomen. Personally, I think it's water weight and given enough rest / sleep I find it subsides. Your age, fitness level and the amount of exercise will impact on the amount of rest you require. Exercise - Concentrate on cardio - remember your calories need to hit a deficit. Run, cycle, row, crossfit, stairmaster, circuit training. Even choosing normal everyday activities helps. Take the stairs instead and try walking / cycling to work. Work your abs - ab pulldowns, leg raises (different positions), leg extensions, planking, bicycle kicks, crunches - there are lots of different exercises you can do.
