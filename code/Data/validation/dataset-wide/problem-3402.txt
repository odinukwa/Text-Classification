try $URL$ it's a little rough but it contains the full text of both Lane and Lisaan al-Arab, in parallel. It's not designed as a dictionary, i.e. something where you just look up a "word". It's a tool for exploring the lexicon. it only understands roots, and will show you all permutations for a root, so you can examine Eg all words that start with "kt" and ponder whether they share a common semantic kernel - a very old theory in Arabic lexicology. you need to read the help screen carefully and experiment. E.g. Lane and the Lisaan pick different roots for some words that have "weak" letters, and I have not yet unified them. 

It has been famously shown (by Emmanuel Dupoux, among others) that the ability to differentiate phonemes markedly decreases after the age of 2. Consequently, you presumably have less ability to distinguish the phonemes of English which are absent in Hungarian that someone who was born and raised in an English-speaking family. In that sense, you might not be a native speaker of English (and you wouldn't be even if you had stayed in the US). The experimental protocol is as follows: subjects listen to increasingly rapid random series of two phonemes X and Y which are distinct in language A but not in language B and are asked to distinguish them. At first the error rate is identical for both native speakers of language A and speakers who are native speakers of language B but grew up in a language A environment since the age of 2, namely linear with respect to the speed of the series . But after a certain threshold, which is independent of the languages A and B of the phonemes X and Y, non-native speakers lose the ability to distinguish X and Y and their answers become no more correct than random ones whereas the error rate of native speakers keeps following the linear rate for a much longer time. 

yes and no. a proform by definition must refer to something else, but that "something else" need not be linguistic. For example, Joe says something crazy. I point my index finger to my temple and swirl it (meaning, that's nutty). Sally points at me and says "he's right" or "that's right" or similar. I haven't said anything, but everybody understands Sally's point. 

Siblingness is a relational property. You cannot be a brother unless you are a brother of somebody else. But you can be a cat without being a cat of something. Youre still a mamnal and not a dog. So a cat is a kind of mammal, but a brother is not a kind of sibling. IOW, siblingness has nothing to do with sex. A brother is a sibling who happens to be male. (Let's leave gender out of it, for simplicity' sake.) A species with only one sex could still have siblings. Amoebae for example. 

The NP Jean has no thematic relation to aime: it obviously does not fit anywhere in the thematic hierarchy outlined by Rowlett (and you can omit it and still get a perfectly well-formed sentence). Examples of thematic dependency abound in the sections 2.1.3 and 2.2.2. Note that within this perhaps seemingly innocuous paragraph is hidden (in plain sight) a very strong and very controversial theory of universal rigid mapping from syntax to semantics. 

The closest natural experiment we can make is to expose an untrained contemporary French speaker to a reading of a text from that period. Conveniently, the poems of Chrétien de Troyes are only a few decades older. I consider myself a relatively educated native speaker of French with basic (but not extensive) training in the relevant fields, and I must say that even taking into account that poetry is presumably harder than ordinary speech, I find a passage such as 

old joke: a language is a dialect with an army. terms like "the German language" are practically useful; they help us to communicate, which is to say, to help us coordinate our actions. But in reality there are no such things. What counts as the German (or French, Chinese, etc) language is always driven by norms established by a dominant social group. Real people speak whatever they speak, which is always unique to the individual: an idiolect. once you have a community of speakers whose idiolects enable successful joint action (communication), then you can start talking about dialects, languages, etc. but in all cases what counts as the language is a matter of norms, not any kind of objective rule or grammar. If you find German perplexing, try Chinese or Arabic. Both of those terms are very broad, umbrella terms that cover enormous variation. It's useful to have them so we can say, e.g. "he speaks Arabic", but in fact nobody speaks "Arabic", since there is no such thing. What he speaks is one of millions of idiolects that enable people in a broad community to communicate. so terms like "the German language" are really more sociological than linguistic. PS. I don't have the citations handy, but there is good reason to think of dictionaries and grammars a indoctrination devices. 

It seems to me that with this question, you envision a much stronger thesis, one which is usually attributed to Kant, as user fdb correctly pointed out. The reason is that the current consensus view that basic mathematical concepts are hard-wired in our brains applies only to very basic mathematical concepts. In fact, I seem to remember reading studies suggesting that not only subtraction with large numbers was not hard-wired, the truth was that our brains are hard-wired to make mistakes while subtracting large numbers (at least when numbers are represented in the usual way). So beyond elementary concepts, the mathematical language developed through the patient working of mathematicians, sometimes (or even often) struggling against their intuitions. Such a struggle will inevitably be extremely sensitive to cultural norms and preconceptions. A famous example is the case of negative number, which were truly accepted in the West only 1500 years after the beginning of mathematics as a science, a clear indication (to me, at least) that there are not (in any self-evident way) a reflexive property of the way our brains are organized. 

easy-peasy: context. what you meant is completely irrelevant once you utter your sentence. you could have meant -in your mind - anybody when you said "he". since your interlocutor cannot read your mind, all she has to go on is context - which includes conventions like "he" refers to the most recent "thing" mentioned to which "he" could reasonably apply. Edited per comment from @user6726: touche! proforms do not "get" or "have" a "meaning". But they do have significance, or if you prefer a functional role. strictly speaking they do not "get" their significance from "context", either - they get it from the norms of linguistic practice, which in turn always involve an interaction with the context.

This list can be deemed minimal because it is a negative list: it restricts the kind of explanation you are allowed to put forth. Especially, if one takes seriously point 4. and 5., it follows that the analysis of any construction in any given language (say left-dislocation in Spoken French) has to proceed through universal explanations in terms of geometry of the tree and feature properties, explanations which in turn possibly (and do, if the work is to have any value) imply predictions bearing on another totally different constructions (say wh-questions in Spoken French) or a similar construction in a totally different language (say left-dislocation in Japanese). For examples of what I consider good work done in this way, I would cite this or this. Where do the lumbering structures come from and why they are actually empirical success stories for minimalism? Now moving on to the justification of the lumbering structures. As Kayne first noted (as far as I know), the combination of point 1. and point 5. above implies the existence of many extremely refined functional projections (if only because a binary tree has a lot of internal nodes compared to the number of its leaves). So it is not that these functional projections were introduced, they were predicted to exist because they were essentially the only solution compatible with the imposed restrictions. This is indeed extremely reminiscent of the epicycles of Ptolemy and extremely worrying: if your theoretical framework leads you to postulate many things nobody has seen, shouldn't you be concerned? That's a very fair criticism but one which actually highlights the predictive power of the core principles above: if our prediction is correct, the functional projection posited (again as the only possible solution within the framework) have to be phonetically overtly present at precisely the assumed position in at least one language. The fact that this has been repeatedly shown to be true is one of the main scientific achievements of minimalism: any serious alternative account should face the challenge head-on and achieve similar predictive power within its own system. A prime example of such a successful prediction is successive cyclic movement (the point of departure between what became minimalism and many other formalization of generative grammar) which is phonetically realized (among may others) in Afrikaans and in cyclic agreement in Chamorro but one can also think about focal projection (realized in Vata) or voice projection (arguably realized in Japanese and Kiswahili). There are of course many more sophisticated ones, from binding theory, the structure of DPs, the properties of nominalizations, the logical interpretation of indefinite objects, the extraction properties of relative clauses... It thus seems to me that the comparison with angels on pinheads is quite unfair: these angels have been repeatedly found ex post on precisely the pinheads they were supposed to be dancing on. What is the appeal? To me, as a complete outsider to the field who has never taken a class in linguistics nor ever intend to (so I feel quite immune to any political influence this or that strand of linguistics might have on the curriculum or, a fortiori, on the hiring process), the appeal to this approach mostly stems from its cross-linguistic potential: as mentioned above, by nature, explanations valid in one language will make predictions and suggest insights for others. While it is quite easy to give a formal description of any specific linguistic phenomenon for a given language (any texas sharpshooter can do this), it seems to me that when it comes to the study of cross-linguistic correlations, minimalism is currently the only game in town. That said, I do think that the comparison with the Ptolemaic system is not off the mark: minimalism might currently be the most precise and clearest unified account we have of syntactic phenomena (just as Ptolemy's system, as famously argued by Otto Neugebauer, endured because of the clarity of its tenets and its very reasonable empirical basis) but it seems fair to me to say that linguistics is still awaiting its Kepler, not to speak of its Newton. 

whether or not "tense" is even meaningful in (Classical) Arabic is an open question. Arabic verbs do not generally have tense, although they have aspect. to give a definite future meaning to an imperfect like yadbribu you prefix the invariant "sawfa", a separate word. but "yadribu" can have any "tense" depending on context. "daraba" is taught as past tense (he struck) and "yadribu" as present or future, but that's wrong. the main distinction is aspect not tense. 

It's because the notion of a phoneme is a theoretical abstraction over actual speech production. Nobody ever pronounces Eg /b/ in exactly the same way twice. But we still (somehow) manage to recognize [b] when we hear it, in all its many guises. The phoneme concept has been offered by some at least as the the one undeniably scientific deliverance of modern "scientific" linguistics. Unfortunately there is no empirical evidence for it. It's undeniably a useful fiction, but it is a fiction, which is closely tied to literacy (would we even imagine a [b] if it were not represented in our written language)?

The Syntax of French by P.Rowlett (see here) would be a canonical answer for French. That said, I think it is worth pointing out that the project of writing a full grammar of a given language (identified presumably with the official language of some nation-state) or even of devising a complete account of some syntactic phenomenon peculiar to a certain language (say object agreement in French) is at least somewhat at cross-purpose with the minimalist entreprise in syntax, as the latter is interested in the syntactic phenomena that stem from the core human faculty of language and its interaction with interface properties and thus has almost by definition nothing to say about the former's apparent object of interest. Much more congenial to the minimalist framework is the project of writing a complete account of a cross-linguistically attested syntactic phenomenon (binding of pronouns, wh-movement, agreement, raising, DP-licensing, voice alternations, noun incorporation etc.) or even better of the correlations between those in the terms outline above. Of that variety of work, you'll find no shortage; the one you are apparently interested in, not so much. 

your America friends are having fun with you. Nobody does this, unless they have hearing problems, the soundtrack is muddy, or they're in a noisy environment like a bar. native speakers of American English are just people, no different than native speakers of any lsnguage. as for spelling, it is complete irrelevant. native speakers never need guidance from written language to disambiguate, in any language. 

Arabic has no fewer than 4 forms: independent, initial, medial, and final. but in all cases there is a "kernel" form common among them all. one advantage of this design is that you do not need spaces to separate words - not a minor consideration if writing materials are expensive. Caveat: in Arabic, final forms are not always distinct. for example final Waw can look just like medial or initial or independent Waw. but the system works.
