If you believe your departing will be in good terms, ask your HR. If not or if you are not sure how your departure will be received by the company, ask a lawyer. In most cases, "written communication" simply means they want clear communication in no uncertain terms, that you have communicated your intended date of departure at a certain date, so the various people that have to then do the various red tapes know when you will leave and can prepare accordingly (payslips, employment record, reassigning work, hiring for replacements, removing access privileges, etc). They don't want this to be mentioned on the passing to your manager, who might then forget to pass the info to HR or pass it late, that they have to rush the red tapes. Email may suffice for this requirement, and in this case, the HR might not necessarily appreciate a physical copy which can be easily misplaced or searched, especially if they have to scan or retype it to let other people know of the details of your departure. In other cases, "written communication" means they want to archive the physical copy with signature for legal/audit/archival/whatever purpose. In this case, you want to print this out and sign it with a pen and ask your HR what other details/attachments are necessary to be put into the physical copy and who has to countersign if any. This may be described in your employment contract or in employee handbook, but if not, the only way to find out is ask your HR. If you don't trust your employer though, if you think they might try make your departure difficult for whatever reasons, then you want to ask a lawyer how best to deliver your departure. Also, you want to ask for a receipt of any letters that you have delivered to them and anything they said. This kind of precaution may be necessary if you have reason to distrust your employer. 

I wouldn't put this on personally.. it's not really volunteer experience in the traditional sense, and while certainly a laudable use of your free time it comes off as a bit "I raise money for charidee don't you know" or that you are really scraping the bottom of the barrel for things to put on your resume. The exceptions to this would be if either the charity you raised money for was relevant to the job (generally this would be if the job was for the charity itself or it was for a cause closely aligned to the organisation's goals - such as if it were for a church and you were applying to an faith-based organisation of the same religion) or if you were going for something related to running maybe. 

That way you are keeping it rational, unemotional and focused on the business priorities - which should be exactly what you boss is focusing on as well. But first off before you do anything to try and change your boss's mind you need to speak to the ex-employee and sound out whether he would want to come back. It's quite feasible that he wouldn't and there is no sense in sticking your neck out if he doesn't want to return! 

Is it your employer that is denying the leave, or just your manager? Whatever the legal situation, it's hard to imagine any employer seriously asking an employee to choose between his job and the use of his hand. If they wanted you gone, it seems like it would be safer to simply fire you rather than wade into the muddy waters surrounding FMLA, ADA, and whatever state regulations there may be. So I am thinking it is one neurotic or ill-trained manager in your chain of command. Consider discussing it with higher-ups, if such exist. Ideally, you want to inform the manager before going over his head, but you are about to lose this job anyway, so do it with or without his permission. 

"Why did you leave that job?" "Oh, that was very sad. [Look sad.] My boss was very ill and he, he passed away. [Make a hand gesture meaning 'whatcha gonna do']." Few interviewers if any are going to have the stones to investigate the connections between his illness, your departure from the company, and his departure from this Earth. If pressed, tell the complete truth: "His disease was... of a psychological nature. He became increasing erratic, fired a number of us, and then took his own life. I suppose I could have asked his inheritors for the job back, but... it was just too much and I thought it better to move on." 

I don't really see the words you mentioned as profane. Strong words, yes they express strong emotion but they are not actually a direct insult to anyone; unprofessional, maybe, if you're in front of a client or someone from a different department, but not necessarily when inside your own turf. If this is the extent to what your boss says, I'd say you probably should just ignore it. In a free country, you do NOT have a right to not be offended, sometimes you just had to take things in stride. With that said, the best way to go with this, IMO, is to talk with the people directly in private. Make it clear to them that you felt uncomfortable with such languages, that you are not used to vulgar languages, and you want them to avoid using them when in your presence; make it clear that the problem is not them but on you. Most reasonable people should understand. If this is also how your boss presents himself professionally with clients or to another department, then things might be different. This kind of behavior may affect the relationships with your clients or the other departments, so if this is the case, then you do have an objective ground to complain. Alternatively, if your company has a policy prohibiting the use of vulgar languages in the office, then you would also have an objective ground to object. Still, it is better to achieve mutually agreed consensus instead of forced compliance, so try to avoid escalating the situation more than is necessary. 

As @Kaz says in the comments all the previous moves are understandable and justifiable, sure that many moves close together isn't an ideal "look" but they aren't horrible by any means. Based on what you told us leaving your current contract now would be hard to justify to another organisation and would definitely look bad. And even worse is that to someone who doesn't know you the other moves being acceptable relies on a certain amount of "benefit of the doubt" being applied - leaving a fixed term contract half way through as you propose could well remove that benefit of the doubt and actually paint the previous moves in a negative light as well exacerbating the problem, so my advice would be to tough it out in the current role and fulfill the contract term. Then you will have a completely reasonable set of circumstances to explain it ending. 

I imagine this is going to come down to personal opinion but I would go with restricting it to cover letter/interview, and I'd also restrict it to purely practical considerations that will have a bearing on your availability and ability to carry out the role you are applying for. Also I'd strongly suggest avoiding the word "spirited" - you probably type that thinking of "vibrant", "fun", "lively". Potential employers on the other hand may read that as parent code for "high maintenance", from your comment I see that your son has special needs and as you say that will probably require some additional flexibility for you (absolutely agree that your son has to come first!) but again I would raise that in cover letter or interview as a purely practical matter. 

Look at this picture? What do you see? That's right: whole lot of red flags. Do not take this job. Ignore the crappy salary. Ignore the passive-aggressive way HR conducts itself. Even ignore the general entitled mindset of "if you need a higher salary to work here, you don't appreciate what a God-given opportunity we are". Just realize that almost all of your future colleagues would have submitted themselves to the same degrading processes you are going through. Perhaps you are in some special circumstance that makes you more receptive to such a distasteful offer, but statistically, most of the other people weren't. They were mediocrities who didn't have a lot of other choices. Decline and, if you feel like it, send a letter to the CEO, saying politely that you would have liked to have worked there, but the unprofessional behavior of their HR department kept that from happening. 

Personal anecdote time (because it's always personal anecdote time): I left a company under, uh, less-than-favorable circumstances. I had been the CTO, so naturally I had access to every system. A few weeks later, I noticed that my user-name and password still worked on the production database. This was typical of the kind of slip-shod behavior that led to my leaving in the first place. Disgruntled ex-employees are always the first suspects if there is a hacking attack, and if one happened, I didn't want anyone to be able to say that "Well, Malvolio still knows the password." So I sent an impersonally worded email to the CEO, telling him to change it. Two weeks later, I checked again, and it had not been changed. I sent the CEO an even more impersonally worded email, to the effect that if my password still worked in 48 hours, I would post the username and password on Hacker News. My sources reported back that the CEO instantly called a meeting of all the remaining engineers and ordered that every password and every username in the system be changed. He wasn't very bright. But that wouldn't be a good solution in the OP's situation, even though he is in almost a precarious position as I was. Since he does not wish to appear petty, this is the perfect time to rely on the passive voice: 

Does your coworker do the same with others? If so it's probably just a quirk of how they speak and not intended to cause offense. If it is just you that they do this with then perhaps it might be worth politely approaching them to enquire whether they are happy with your work and how you communicate with them but to be honest if everything else seems normal with your working relationship I wouldn't bother. It might be that they have a minor problem with you or with your communication style but if it's not something serious enough to warrant them giving you proper feedback about it then it's probably not serious enough for you to worry about. 

While you have my sympathy to a certain extent (I loathe frontend work if I'm honest!) I do have to point out that what you "feel" you should be working on is largely irrelevant, I might "feel" that I should be working on my XBOX Live gamerscore but I doubt that my employer would agree. The company hired you as a full stack developer (and they told you as much) and that includes just as much frontend work as backend, in fact in reality it means that you are multipurpose resource for the company who can do either back or front end work depending on the business needs at the time. So you either need to accept that and do the frontend elements to the best of your ability or move on and look for backend roles, and there would be nothing wrong with that at all - as I said I hate front end work and I tailor my job search to reflect that. You may be able to steer your current role more towards your liking (I wouldn't count on it since they clearly have a need for front end skills) and the best way to approach that is to have a one-to-one conversation with your manager, something like: 

It's time for a show and tell. Show the management how much money they would have been able to save if they had just stopped the fire and invested in improving the processes in some point in the past. Tell them that this is not a futile situation and that your can improve the situation. Show then that you can do the improvements that you proposed. Tell them what you intend to do, what you needed from the company, and how long it would take for their investments to recover its initial costs. Show them the risks of not improving the situation. Tell them the risks of the investment and the exit strategy if the project doesn't work out. Talk in their own language, in a language they can understand, so they can evaluate the values, costs, and risks themselves. Do your research. Quantify these costs, risks, and returns. Managements usually don't like taking about things in terms of "better", they need real numbers to work with. If the management is still unwilling to buy in and assuming that you believe that you have made a reasonable and sensible proposal, then the biggest problem you have is that your priorities aren't aligned with the company's priorities. You are a poor fit with the job that your company is offering you. Find another job in which you can express your personality better. 

Don't do this... instead hang a neon flashing sign around your neck that says "I'm not ready for management responsibilities" it will be much more efficient. 

Essentially your first step has to be putting together a business case for why the team is needed and how the benefits having such a team would bring outweigh the costs to the business in doing so. Some useful questions to ask yourself when doing this: 

The wording on the "WORK EXPERIENCE" section of the posting is a little clumsy but I've seen far worse and it's not uncommon to leave some ambiguity when listing required experience since it's far from an exact science. Regarding the difference between recruiter and in-house postings as ever YMMV but in my experience many of those vague recruiter-posted listings have either come verbatim from the employer or the requirements from the company have been exceptionally vague resulting in the recruiter applying scatter-gun buzzwords to make sure the net is cast wide enough. So it's not really a surprise to see an in-house posting be a bit on the wooly side. For the posting as-written, to me that reads as them preferring candidates with development-related experience but the lack of explicit exclusions for those that don't would probably mean that if I were a candidate who had acquired the required skills outside of a work environment (through academia, personal projects etc) then I'd probably apply and look to clarify if any experience requirements are non-flexible as part of the application. 

I see some possible solutions, depending on the specifics of your industry and your office: One is scout around and independently line up some replacement, three or four people who would make really good candidates. When your co-workers give notice, you can swoop into your boss's office with the hot résumés. A lot of companies, you can pick up five or ten grand in referral money that way. At least this gives you the whole of February to bring them up to speed. Or you can go to your boss now, swear him to secrecy, reveal the situation, and explain your plan, which is to add on two more employees to the team, as of January 1. If your co-workers are the kind of jackasses they sound like, your boss will probably not be surprised and will already be thinking about ways to replace them anyway. Last, and this requires a fair amount of dishonesty on your part, tell your boss that you yourself may have a "condition" that will likely require extensive medical treatment, and you'll be out for several months, starting in February, but you think that he should begin hiring your replacement now. Of course, once your co-workers resign, you will experience a miraculous recovery and you won't need to take medical leave -- and the new guy should be trained in plenty of time to cover for you in March.
