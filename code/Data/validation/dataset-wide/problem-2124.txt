It is, but you need a lot of work from both your old and new company and both will not want to invest this amount of work in you, especially not the company you intend to leave. 

I think your example stems from the fact that the fictional character is part of a military organization. Any time safety is a thing, you need officers whose orders are followed and not questioned. Or rather questioned in private after the situation is dealt with. That goes for real world army, police, firefighters, paramedics, rescue workers and all other people that work in environments where when someone says "MOVE" you move first and think about it later, to not get hurt. So apologizing in public means you allow people to think you might fail and it might be a good idea to question your orders, even for a split second thinking about them. That's not seen as good, it's seen as something that might make you doubt an order and hinder it's proper execution. And in the end, those orders are given to bring you (the statistical "you", it might put the personal "you" in danger first) home safely. Now for the business world, this does not apply. We can question the "orders" all the time. This is how good decisions are made. And nobody is in danger. On the bridge of the Enterprise, thinking about whether "shields up" is really the right thing to do can lead to a very spectacular and fast end of the season. Now if someone thinks about his bosses business decisions for an hour, nobody is getting hurt. And if it indeed was a wrong decision, there is no harm in apologizing. If somebody thinks I can make mistakes, maybe he will jump in to correct them next time before I do something stupid. Apologizing is a sign of respect and in business, you have the time to show that respect. 

Simply put, businesses do not need brain surgeons. They need workers. And if a Java developer with 5 years experience can do the job well, why would you pay somebody more who has more experience when all he can achieve is the same result? Experience only counts if you can translate it to a better production process. Either faster, or less errors or any other metric. And in Software development, after a certain point you have all the knowledge and experience you need to program normal business software. Look around you, there is no genius programming an online shop. It does not take a genius. It's just code. It certainly gets better once you have done it a few times, but it does not get much better once you have done it like 20 times. There is not much difference between someone who built 20 online shops and someone who built 25. If you want a higher paying job, you need to look into a market segment where you need very experienced people, where you can learn and use new things even after 10 years. Or go into management. Or go into a market segment, nobody really wants to be in (SAP comes to mind). 

As to the edit of the question how to find out if something is good as a test, just do what you did: ask your peers. Whenever there is a test to be prepared, I always grab members of other teams and try it with them. Have a few people do it and include the feedback they give on time and difficulty. As you are the only developer, you will need another way to find peers to do this: maybe a user group, your old classmates or a forum. Do it as you would deliver software: Gather requirements (what do I want to test the candidates for), plan a test (prototype), let testers do it and gather their feedback, then refine the final product as many times as you see fit. 

A relieving letter is a purely Indian thing which may be completely unknown in Saudi Arabia. You will have better success if you ask for a document that has your name and start and end date of employment. Those documents are called different names around the world, but are pretty universal because every country needs them one way or another. Contact your former employer again and ask about the process, explain what a relieving letter is and if they cannot write one for you, ask for a proof of employment instead. If they don't answer your email, call them. Don't forget to keep your MNC updated on the progress. 

If you are absolutely certain that no matter what will happen on that interview, you will not take the offer, then by all means cancel that interview. Yes, they already paid in advance. But by actually interviewing you they will pay a lot more in terms of time of their employees. Compared to the cost of HR and business people scheduling time for your interview, the airline tickets and hotel costs are peanuts. I don't see anything ethical about lying to them to have them waste their time (and yours). 

This has little to do with the cost of living. Companies don't even care if you live. As long you as do your work that is. It is about cost to the company. I will make some assumptions here: you are working in a job that could be done by local German employees as well. Working remotely probably means some kind of tech job. While Germany has a shortage in certain professions, none of them could be done remote. Let's further assume that on average Germans and Lebanese can do the job in question at the same level. On average, there is no reason to hire one over the other as far as job relevant skills are concerned. Now morally, it would only be fair if you got the same money for the same work you provide to the company, right? You work the same 40h week with the same skills on the same tasks as local employees. But look at it from the company perspective. They incur costs on top of your salary. They pay overhead for the lebanese company. They pay your travel costs. They incur a communication overhead if you don't speak perfect German. So to just be equal cost to the company, your salary needs to be lower than a local's salary by at least the amount they spend on travel costs and overhead. And then, you are equal cost. Why would they hire you over a local guy everything else being equal? You need an advantage over the local guy, even if just a little one. Assuming equal skill level on average, that only leaves money as a leverage. To actually be hired, you need to be cheaper than locals even with the travel expenses and overhead costs. That's why your salary is not the same by quite a margin. Companies only care for profit and they only make a profit employing you if you are cheaper overall than a local. 

No, you don't need to disclose where you are going. Just don't mention it when handing in your notice. If you boss asks, think about what you want to tell him. Any answer that is not an outright lie is okay. You can not tell anything or keep it vague or tell anyone everything. That's up to you. 

No (At least not in Germany) There certainly is some wiggle room. If the company car broke down in the middle of nowhere and the driver asked you if you could call a mechanic on your private phone because he forgot the company phone, that would be acceptable. If the company later pays the expenses. And surely we would not be here writing if that had happened, because that would indeed be a non-planned, one-time, paid-for emergency that everybody is fine with. Installing software on a private device to do your regular work for the company because the company is either too cheap or did a shitty job planning, is in no way something you need to do. I mean why do they even assume you have a phone? You owning a private phone is not part of your contract. 

So to come out ahead, you need to earn more than what you lose by working. We cannot help you with prioritizing your life. But you need to ask yourself: With the money you earn, can you buy back what you lose and still have money left? Because if you don't, working that job does not make sense. So in your specific case, do you get enough money to buy happiness and health? You can certainly buy a pretty shallow (or deep but we likely aren't talking about that amount of money here) imitation of happiness, but you won't be able to buy health. You need to change something. Maybe quit, maybe find another solution by asking a different question here. But simply proceeding on the way you are on now will not work. 

If s/he has the exact same name as you it's definitely strange. There is no harm in marking it "(not related)" or even "(not me and not related)" to signal that it's neither a typo nor a relative of yours. 

If you get pay "under the table" then it's illegal. It also means that money is not on your payslip and therefor anything that relies on your payslip to make calculations (for example unemployment, health care, pensions or credit) is still calculated with your old salary. There is no reason why you shouldn't get an official pay raise. However, make sure that your current additional pay is actually under the table. What may have happened is that there is a corporate overlord policy that raises are only done on a certain date but your boss has a budget he can do with as he pleases, so he gives you 8 one-time-bonuses to keep you happy until it gets official. These one-time-bonuses should be on your payslip, although they would not count for the calculations of your steady income.

Yes I have done so multiple times and it never was a problem. Even with dentist visits that should be painless and over before work, I have called in to report that it took way longer and was more painful then expected and I need the rest of the day off. Be careful with the "work from home" part. In my eyes, work from home is fine, if your problem can be solved or is less severe at home. Need to use the restrooms spontaneously and often? Have a broken bone or back pain so you don't want to move? Don't want to spread something contagious? OK, work from home. I don't see how a dental problem could be less severe at home, so you should make up your mind: can you work with the pain, or can you not? And if you cannot, which is perfectly acceptable, then call in sick. 

In an agile setting, you put this on the table in your next retrospective meeting. Decide how you feel about it as a team and talk to the member of the management staff. You may need help with your agile setting. The fact that a member of the management staff has not a designated agile role interacting with your team in that way and the fact that you did not know how to approach a problem like this makes me think you are not quite there yet. 

A scrum team should be between 5 and 9 people. 12 is excessive. We are 7 people and it's easy: when one rises, all others will look up and think "oh, it's standup". Make sure it's easy to be there on time: 

If you really want to do this, the first step is to contract an actual union to help you. You cannot do this on your own against a company with 20 years of experience avoiding exactly that.
