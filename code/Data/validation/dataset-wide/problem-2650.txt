(None of these are deep, or inaccessible in the writings of men, but they clash with components of the male role, based on defending boundaries, negotiating hierarchy, and seeming to make one's own decisions. So they fall out of theories, or they take pernicious, confrontational forms as in Marx or the Frankfurt School.) Consider how long it took epistemology to get to Wittgenstein's notion of language-games, which after failing at a more forthright sort of logical positivism, finally injects a lot of these aspects very directly into the theory of meaning: meaning is a human game, upon which we are totally dependent, based on consensus, and we play to win, but we do not win without mutual support (because then the consensus around the game breaks down and we start saying nonsense and claiming it is deep). This whole summary is made up of those same recurring feminist principles. Can anyone be sure it is thoroughly irrelevant that he happened to be gay? (Before I go further, apologies: If it offends you to link homosexuality and femininity, I understand, but I cannot agree -- they are not similar, but they are linked. And on other fronts, I could equally emphasize aspects that are characteristically German, Owning-class, Jewish and Catholic, though I won't because they are not relevant here. So if this makes me a bigot, I am at least an equal-opportunity bigot. After all, I am a Nietzsche fanboy.) Maybe that means we would have gotten to this point earlier, from a history with a better mixture of masculine and feminine perspective. And maybe that means we can get a cleaner way forward from there with a more equally mixed perspective. 

Someone should point out that the semantics mathematicians actually use on a day-to-day basis is still second-order logic, or the equivalent, despite all the worry over foundations. We generally allow one layer of reference to sets of sets, and implicitly assume 'Currying' makes this totally sufficient. And we do not weaken the logic to avoid the contradiction, unless we are trapped into a corner by a logician or a paradox. Even people who reject large pieces of the standard logic of mathematics by requiring some level of 'constructiveness' do not reduce their thinking to first-order manipulations, but instead control access to negation and universality claims that are not grounded in some specific perspective. The focus on first-order logic as the basis of everything seems to have sidetracked logic away from actual mathematical practice, and basically stopped the search for a usable standard logic within second-order logic, with the assumption that all of them will fall prey to the elevated version of Godel's theorem. This is not a foregone conclusion. I have seen occasional work on 'well-foundedness' definitions (a la Category Theory as an alternative set theory) and other restraints on self-reference as a basis for a form of logic that works more on the basis of consistency by resolving or converging loops than on a positivistic basis that requires an absolute foundation, but it seems to proceed slowly and does not get taught. 

Nietzsche recognizes Christ as a Creator. As I see it, his intention is to address the slave morality that grew up around Christianity, rather than the teachings of Christ per se. Liberation Theologians like George Pixley in "The Kingdom of God" and other writings have proposed that this is not implicit in the religion as proposed, or practiced by early followers. If you strip away the effects of Pauline overstatements further amplified by Roman Catholic history, the original message is far from what we consider Christian now. As quoted at length in $URL$ Nietzsche himself blames Paul and the context of Judaism for the worst parts of historical Christianity. Statements by Christ in the Gospels like "Those you hold bound to their sins, are held bound." and "I come not with peace, but with a sword..." are not consistent with slave morality to begin with. They convey a power of real judgment that is meant to be used, not handed back over to God, and they suggest that it be defended with widespread and continual violence, if only of a metaphorical nature. For instance directives to "Turn the other cheek." and to "Go the extra mile" can be seen as paradoxical techniques for manipulating oppressors into internal conflicts with their own honor, rather than as calls to submission. E.g. $URL$ Such sentiments inject a countercurrent into the message itself that can be broadened by criticism like Nietzsche's. It can be argued that Christianity, as presented in the words of Christ, is intentionally invested in paradox, rather than in the straightforward reversal of the moral value of slave and master roles that it turned into, which ultimately 'kills God.' 

I think the appropriate response would be not to respond. To the degree that you feel these events are the outcome of decisions that you can affect, you should already be involved in affecting them. To the degree that they are not, you should not arrogate to yourself an attempt to control the things that are not of value to you. To think of a thing or reconsider its importance to your life only because of the whims of fortune is to give your emotional stability away to be subjected to random influences that do not have humanity's best interests at heart and ultimately can do you no good. 

What is the purpose of punishment? If it is to link consequences to decisions, then the question is whether that old collection of molecules should have predicted the damage it would cause any better than this new collection of molecules. Our notions of learning imply that behavior is a feedback loop and the consistency of personality is unrelated to the set of molecules that embody it, but related to the information that flows through them. So by and large, the prediction of recidivism remains good over long periods of time. Our morality gets no better with time, and the corresponding replacement of molecules, unless something else changes. The better question is whether you should incarcerate, for instance, an amnesiac, or an addict who has just undergone something like ibogaine therapy, a rapist subject to chemical castration, or a terrorist who has undergone a religious conversion: a person who really feels like a 'new person' and has had a real part of their personality deactivated or removed in a way that has statistically proven likely to change current and future decision making. 

It is specifically just the genetic fallacy: assuming an argument is erroneous on the basis of its provenience. But I prefer to see it as what CS Lewis named 'Bulverism' -- diagnosing an argument as a symptom of something (the speaker's known or presumed bias or ignorance, the social or political context, any psychological dynamics at play, concurrent rhetorical manipulations, etc.) instead of considering its content The specific diagnosis given in both of your example cases is 'ignorance through lack of exposure'. However you choose to identify it in particular, as @elmer007 notes above, you can tell this is a fallacy right away because it is ad hominem -- pointed at the speaker and not the content. Even if ignoring or being especially dubious about an argument for some contextual reason is sensible, it is always still a fallacy. Logically, one can only reject an argument based upon its content -- which involves actually considering the content. 

To put the relevant aspect I see in those contributions that are lifted straight out of either an Eastern or a Hermetic notion of non-duality most simply: 

I think this has more to do with the idea of fluxion and the cohesiveness that surface tension gives to fluids, not of relative motion. To think of the thing that allows for motion as moving seems like a logical trap that can only lead to paradoxes. We segment the metaphor of fluidity into at least three aspects. Time 'flows' in that it maintains continuity (as in the way hair or robes flow, even if they don't move) not in that it arrives at a given rate (the way bullets might flow out of a machine gun) or that gets from one place to another (the way traffic flows). 

There were no citizens of Greece at the time. So no, it makes no sense. Greece, like Germany, and post-Roman Italy, was not a single nation until after the culture already had a long shared history. (This has led German philosophers like Hegel and Nietzsche to link and contrast the psychological foundations of the Greek, German, and renaissance Italian cultures.) Socrates was a citizen of Athens, one of the few Greek states that had citizens at all. The rest were run by Tyrants, and therefore had subjects. Also, Socrates was not exiled or ostracized, he was sentenced to death and followed through on the sentence instead of taking on a different nationality. He insisted on not requesting exile, despite that he could have counter-plead for that punishment, and would probably have gotten it. And he insisted on not escaping, even though some of his students seem to have arranged a way for him to do exactly that, and offered him the option. So he was Athenian to the end.
