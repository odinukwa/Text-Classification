This question has been answered in the comments by Jason Starr. The morphism $i$ is in general not defined and the composition will in general not map to a component of the target. I am reposting this as a CW answer; if it gets upvoted, this question will not reappear on the front page. 

In terms of mixed Hodge theory you have $$ P(X) = \sum_k \dim(\mathrm{Gr}^W_k H^\ast_c(X)) \cdot t^k$$ where $H^\ast_c(X)$ is the direct sum of all the (rational) cohomology groups of $X$ with compact support. So the most natural condition on $X$ which implies that its Poincaré polynomial equals $P(X)$, is that $X$ is compact and that all its cohomology groups are pure. In particular "projective" can be weakened to "proper", and "smooth" can be weakened to "rational homology manifold", but there are more examples, e.g. the projective cone over a smooth projective curve. 

Addendum: Maybe I can say something about how the usual homotopy invariance of cohomology is visible in the 'six functor' formalism. For any space $X$ let $\pi_X$ be the projection to a point, then the cohomology of $X$ (with any coefficients) just corresponds to functor $R \pi_{X\ast} \circ \pi_X^\ast$. If $f \colon X \to Y$ is an arbitrary map, then note that $\pi_Y \circ f = \pi_X$ which implies $$ R\pi_{Y\ast} \circ Rf_\ast \circ f^\ast \circ \pi_Y^\ast = R \pi_{X\ast} \circ \pi_X^\ast;$$ and now the morphism $\mathbf 1 \to Rf_\ast \circ f^\ast$ coming from the adjunction gives a map $f^\# \colon R \pi_{Y\ast} \circ \pi_Y^\ast \to R \pi_{X\ast} \circ \pi_X^\ast$. Of course evaluating this equation on a choice of coefficients we get the usual map $H^\bullet(Y) \to H^\bullet(X)$. The correct way to express homotopy invariance is now that if $f$ and $g$ are homotopic maps $X \to Y$, then $f^\#$ and $g^\#$ are equal. This can be generalized to the relative situation, when $X$ and $Y$ are spaces over some base space $S$ and we consider the derived pushforward to $S$ instead of to a point, and we take homotopies over $S$. 

Here's a question out of idle curiosity. Let $G$ be a topological group. Is it possible for both $G$ and (a model of) $BG$ to be finite CW complexes? (Apart from the obvious example of $G$ being [up to homotopy] the trivial group.) A comment is that the fibration sequence $G \to EG \to BG$ shows that $\chi(G)\chi(BG) = 1$ in this case, so $\chi(G) = \pm 1$. This rules out plenty of examples, e.g. Lie groups, finite groups... 

The question has essentially been answered in the comments, I am recording this here so that the question does not get bumped back to the top. Theo Buehler and Buschi Sergio both gave nice references, and it seems that this notion is well known in K-theory under the name "category with duality". Martin's remarks were also helpful. 

The short answer is that you have a morphism of sheaves $f^\ast \Omega_N \to \Omega_M$; equivalently, by adjunction, a morphism $\Omega_N \to f_\ast\Omega_M$. This map of sheaves gives the "global" pullback map on forms as $$\Omega(N) = \Gamma(N,\Omega_N) \to \Gamma(N,f_\ast \Omega_M) = \Omega(M).$$ Two examples: 

Let $X$ be a smooth complex projective variety. Let $F(X,n)$ be the configuration space parametrizing $n$ distinct ordered points in $X$. The cohomology groups $H^k(F(X,n),\mathbf Q)$ carry a mixed Hodge structure, by Deligne. Is there an example where this mixed Hodge structure does not split? In other words, where there is no isomorphism $ H^k(F(X,n), \mathbf Q) \cong \bigoplus_{i} \mathrm{Gr}^W_i H^k(F(X,n), \mathbf Q) $? I assume the answer is yes and that an example can be found already when $n=3$ and $X$ is a curve of genus $\geq 2$, but I don't know one. I would also be interested in the analogous question for $\ell$-adic cohomology and $X$ over (say) a finitely generated field. Motivation: I was doing some computations about cohomology of configuration spaces which led me to making an optimistic conjecture, which I then realised would imply that all mixed Hodge structures of this form must split. This made me no longer believe the conjecture, but I don't actually have a counterexample. 

There are a million examples. You should google "acyclic space". Here is one: if you remove a point from a homology sphere you get a manifold whose cohomology is trivial in positive degrees. Take a tubular neighbourhood of it in some $\mathbf R^n$ and you get an open domain. 

The history of John Rainwater can be read at the following link: $URL$ He has 10 published articles and several unpublished ones, by varying authors from the University of Washington. The same page also mentions in passing three other mathematical pseudonyms: P. Orno, M. G. Stanley, and H. C. Enoses. 

Addendum, much later: The paper "On the number of curves of genus 2 over a finite field" by Gabriel Cardona determines the actual number of isomorphism classes of genus two curves over a finite field (of odd characteristic). The even characteristic case is treated in a companion paper. 

It's a classical result that if $X$ is paracompact and locally contractible, then singular cohomology and Cech cohomology of $X$ coincide, with coefficients in any abelian group. A reference is Spanier's textbook. This applies in particular to the underlying space of an orbifold, in which case a small neighborhood of any point is the cone on the link of the point. 

Since $GL(1,\mathbf R)$ and the symmetric group $S_2$ are homotopy equivalent as topological groups, there is a bijective correspondence between isomorphism classes of real line bundles and double covers. It follows that a simply connected space has no nontrivial real line bundles. 

This is essentially Lemma 4.10 of Hatcher's book, which is the key step in proving the cellular approximation theorem. It shows that you can homotope $\varphi_f$ so that there is an open set $U$ in your $p$-cell $e$ such that $\varphi_f$ is piecewise linear on the inverse image of $U$. Then a general element of $U$ has only finitely many preimages. 

The Leray spectral sequence for $f \colon X \to S$ and the sheaf $\mathbf Q$ degenerates. The map $H^n(\overline X,\mathbf Q) \to W_nH^n(X,\mathbf Q)$ is surjective. $H^0(S,R^nf_\ast \mathbf Q)$ is pure. 

Torsten Ekedahl proposed a definition of higher Grothendieck groups of varieties. Unfortunately it seems that he never wrote anything down on this topic before passing away. Torsten had quite a large number of unfinished mathematical manuscripts and projects. I don't know what happened to them, although surely someone at Stockholm University has taken care of them. I saw him give a talk about higher Grothendieck groups of varieties at Gerard van der Geer's birthday conference on Schiermonnikoog in 2010. The abstract is available online: $URL$ 

Your question has been answered by Reimundo Heluani but let me spell out things in full detail. Suppose you have a gerbe on a smooth manifold $M$ in your sense, given by $(U_i,L_{ij},\alpha_{ijk})$. Here is a procedure for cooking up a stack out of this data: i) Let $P_i = U_i \times \mathrm{BGL}(1)$ for all $i$. A map $X \to P_i$ is the same as a map to $U_i$ and a line bundle on $X$. ii) For each pair of indices $i,j$, a map $X \to U_i \times_M P_j$ is a map $f \colon X \to U_i \cap U_j$ and a line bundle $L$ on $X$. Now define a $1$-morphism $\phi_{ij} \colon U_i \times_M P_j \to U_j \times_M P_i$ by the rule $(f,L) \mapsto (f,L \otimes f^\ast L_{ij})$. iii) For each triple of indices $i,j,k$ there are two natural isomorphisms $ U_i \times_M U_j \times_M P_k \to U_k \times_M U_j \times_M P_i$ which we may abusively denote $\phi_{ik}$ and $\phi_{ij}\circ \phi_{jk}$, and the isomorphism $\alpha_{ijk}$ defines a $2$-morphism between these. iv) For each quadruple overlap, the cocycle condition for the $\alpha$'s ensures that these $2$-morphisms commute strictly. Thus we obtain gluing data that allows us to glue together all the $P_i \to U_i$ to a stack $P \to M$, which is locally a "$\mathrm{BGL}(1)$-bundle". 

Yes, this would imply that $\newcommand{\X}{\mathcal X}\X^s$ is the coarse moduli space, but I don't think this is the "right" question to ask -- I believe that $\X^s$ will not even form a sheaf unless $\X$ happens to be a scheme/algebraic space to begin with. Anyway, any morphism from a groupoid to a set factors through $\pi_0$ of the groupoid. This implies in particular that any morphism from $\X$ to an algebraic space factors through the presheaf $\X^s$. And the map $\X \to \X^s$ is a bijection on geometric points because it's in fact a bijection on $S$-points for any scheme $S$. So if $\X^s$ is a scheme/algebraic space then it is the coarse moduli space. 

Though Mark Grant's comment links to the right answer (what you are looking for is called the Gysin sequence), the Wikipedia page doesn't state it in the form you want. In general, for an open subset $U \subset X$ of an algebraic variety $X$, there is a long exact sequence $$\cdots \to H^i_c(U) \to H^i_c(X) \to H^i_c(X\setminus U) \to H^{i+1}_c(U) \to \cdots$$ of étale cohomology groups. This should be in any reference on étale cohomology. The analogue in de Rham cohomology is easy to understand, and this is how I usually remember this sequence. A compactly supported differential form on $U$ admits an extension by zero to all of $X$, and the restriction of a compactly supported differential form on $X$ to the closed subset $X\setminus U$ is a compactly supported form on $X \setminus U$. This gives an exact sequence $$0 \to \Omega_c^\bullet(U) \to \Omega_c^\bullet(X) \to \Omega_c^\bullet(X\setminus U) \to 0$$ whose cohomology gives the above long exact sequence. 

I guess I knew that I should've looked in part 2 of Lazarsfeld's book before posting this question, but it was checked out of the library... Anyway, the speculation in the last paragraph is correct: if $X$ is a smooth projective variety and $E$ is an ample vector bundle on $X$ of rank $e$, then $c_e(E)$ has the $2e$-HLP. This is exactly the statement of Theorem 7.1.10 in Positivity in Algebraic Geometry II. (Lazarsfeld only considers multiplication by a single top Chern class, not powers of it, but this is equivalent by replacing $E$ by $E^{\oplus r}$). 

Let $C$ be a smooth curve over a finite field of characteristic $p$. Let $t$ be a local parameter at a point. If $f$ is a regular function on a neighbourhood of the point, one can write uniquely $$f = \sum_{i=0}^{p-1} f_i^p t^i $$ for functions $f_i$. Using this decomposition one can define an operator on differential forms on $C$ via $$ f \mathrm d t \mapsto f_{p-1} \mathrm d t.$$ Amazingly (?) this does not depend on the choice of coordinate, producing a map of sheaves $\Omega_C \to \Omega_C$. This is the Cartier operator. Question: What is so special about $\Omega_C$ here? Is there a similar construction on quadratic differentials? On spin curves, i.e. on a square root of $\Omega_C$? I am told that the Cartier operator is analogous to the residue of a logarithmic differential form. So I guess a similar question (that I don't know how to answer either) is what makes the residue tick.
