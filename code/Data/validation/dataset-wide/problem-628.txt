The contestants: Shimano SL-BS64 Ultegra Bar End Shifter Set (8-Speed) and Dia Competition Grand competition ENE bar end control. Seem fairly similar and both well loved. I'm aiming at pairing these with something like 26/36/48 and 7 speed 12-32. Am I missing any good possibilities? 

I have a 48 tooth main ring with 165 cranks. FD is Sora double and rear is Tiagra short with Shimano 7 freewheel. If I can put this 34 ring on it gives me sufficient range for the next few months and time to evaluate before any larger purchase of cranks. (likely I would go to 170 0r 172.5) I'm using Diacompe bar end friction shift. Is it necessary or desirable to replace large ring as well? 

I have a 520 mm cro-mo vintage tsunado road bike. It has 27 inch wheels. I'm putting a pannier rack on the back *preferably steel, but I'll consider Al. It doesn't have the upper mounts but the dropouts have fenders so there are points there. I am going to be using it for touring, commuting, even picking up materials for the construction I'm doing (if anyone knows how to load a 3/4 inch sheet of ply onto bike, I'll be really surprised) I'm sure that I'd like to be able to load at least 25kg on that. I'd be very interested in any pointers on what to get. I'd like to keep the price in the best bang for buck range, function/quality nothing fancy. If there any thoughts on bags I'm equally interested - Thanks 

I have old dull aluminum break pulls on dropbars with suicide levers. The new brakes are Tektro long reach. Should I change the levers? If so what is a good quality/price lever to buy? 

My first bike after move to Japan. Picked up an old 520 Cro-MO frame by Tsunoda - Grand Prix , minimal rust and decent paint. It had some old Suntour VX derailleurs, aluminum-far-too-narrow drop bar with suicide brakes, Sugino 165 cranks, lowbar Shimano friction shifters, Araya 27x1.25 aluminum rims (close to true) and a freewheel 6 speed -Suntour - 125mm rear end. I decided for now to go with the original wheels (new tires, tape and tubes - repack bearings & replace rear axle), but swap the old freewheel for a new Shimano 7. front derailleur to Sora double, rear derailleur to Tiagra RD-4601 (10 speed), keep friction shift for now, replace handlebar, breaks Tektro Long. So here is the part that I am very interested in hearing from people about; I wanted to work with the bike for a while, get a good feel before settling on a handset (this will be the biggest cost and from what I can tell the most constrained decision)which includes deciding to change wheels or build a new rear 27 to go with modern 10 speed index shift or get a handset to work with the 7 speed or what? 

It turns out that it was a stiff link, stripping the chain off the bike, dousing it in brake cleaner, then oil and leaving it to bathe a few minutes, then repeating the process left the chain rust and dirt free, looking like new. When I took off the chain, I broke it at the stuck link (which was clearly evident going through the derailleur when pedalling the bike backwards) -- cleaned everythingh whilst I had the opportunity and reassembled. Whilst the chain was off, I did measure it, and things were within tolerance, although (I assume naturally) a little stretched. Thanks for the help, I now have again a reliable bike! 

Apologies for my dodgy graphics work, the middle is threaded, and sized to fix the (slightly larger than the wheel nut thread) centre of the coaster brake axel, the outsides smooth (very much resembling a washer) except for the two grooves. The entre part is perhaps 20mm in diameter; unfortunately my bright idea of drawing the part, and then using Google image search has failed me! In the end, I'm sure this particular bolt is a strange european relic designed as some kind of "security" bolt; not dissimilar to the Apple style 5-point start, or similar, to discourage people against fiddling with their coaster brake. But I would really like to rebuild the brake! I'm sure I could replace them with regular "cone nuts" - that is the ones with two flat sides, but the term "cone nut" seems to refer more to the purpose than the design of the nut itself. All information appreciated, thanks in advance! 

I'm attempting to refurbish a bike that I was given, it has a (not sure what brand) coaster brake, which according to sheldon brown's site has a peculiar kind of cone nut. The wheel might be 10 years old, it's hard to say. I've been able to remove the otherwise butchered nuts (see below) using a tap & hammer and an axle vice, now that they are free I'd like to know what they are, so that I can replace them, do they have a special name? I've only ever seen mention of cone nuts resembling a regular washer, but with two flat sides (sorry for the poor explanation) - these that this bike is fitted with are something different, see below: 

Learning to listen to your body equates to developing discipline in your training. Changing the type of exercise can help you give specific muscle groups rest but you can still exercising without the discipline to meter your effort and therefore not actually rest. My suggestion is to write out your exercise plan and journal how you do. The aim of the plan is to allot time to hammer your body with space to let your body recover. That also means you choose your exercises and routes appropriately - no hills on easy days. Keep track of what you do, be diligent to stick to what you write down. If something isn't working, change your written plan, but follow your plan. DISCLAIMER: Consult a doctor regarding your efforts, 4 days of forced recovery means you aren't recovering and you risk severe injury and burnout. Discipline is an additional "muscle" that you will need to exercise, strengthen and push to its limit. The harder you work on your discipline the more consistent you will ride, the better you will recover and the more you'll know about what your body can handle. Developing a plan and learning to meter your effort will pay dividends for you TT as well. No amount of strength will help you in your race if you blow your energy within 1 mile and struggle the last 12.3 miles. Best of luck. 

Short answer: you will not notice the difference in tire choice. Since you are adding a couple kg of rucksack luggage to your bike, that will be what you notice, not your tires. Since you are touring and not racing your thoughts should turn to endurance of your body and your equipment. The heavier, puncture resistant tires may be a wise tire to use so you won't be as concerned about flats enroute to your destination. The extra KG you will be carrying is going to make noticeable changes to how your bike handles along with how much effort your are going to exert uphill. Take the time leading up to ride with your expected gear in place so you know what it's going to feel like. Cheers! Have a great ride. 

Please excuse my terminology, I have a Specialized Tricross (2008) with Shimano Tiagra STI levers, and convenience brakes on the top of the bars, running through the same cable. Naturally, adjusting brakes is easy enough, but I have a very sharp pull on the (flat bars, if I can call them that) - and my STIs pull almost all the way to the stop before even engaging. Can this be a case of badly adjusted brakes? I asked my Bike shop to service the bike (minor service) - and it came back more or less like this, it's not dangerous, at all - but I like a very short pull on my brakes after a nasty TFCC injury that still isn't recovered. I've checked the manuals for the STI levers (I expected some kind of internal setting I could crank on these, and have them take up the slack from the ) Whilst we're at it, what's the proper name for these inline top-brakes? 

I have two bicycles that suffer this problem, both pretty heavy frames (one a ladies, Hollander bike, and the other a man's commuter) - both have correctly adjusted Derailleurs which don't produce any noise or rub on the chain during normal riding. However with both, on flat ground, at nominal speed - once every 3-10 revolutions of the chain it will simply skip; there's no drive for a quarter of a turn and then everything is OK. I had originally assumed that this was a misalignment, or normal chain-skip (as I had only noticed it under heady load, cycling hard out of the saddle. However noticing the same happens on my girlfriend's bike, and on mine when I'm taking it easy disconcerts me, and leaves me with little confidence in the bike. I'm not sure where to start diagnosing, however I suspect that stripping the drive train might be a startâ€¦ perhaps also examining the chain for nipped-links, and the sprockets for damaged teeth (although, both bikes have a bash-guard on the front sprocket) Any help or advice greatly appreciated, I'm a pretty handy motorcycle mechanic, but I always found working on my Human powered bikes a lot more fiddly :) 

Due to the critical job of your brakes in helping you race safely, the wiser action is to replace your equipment rather than try to fix this type of break. The shifting and brake system may work now but the system is compromised and can fail at any time regardless of how you patch it up. It's hard to swallow, for sure, but you are putting yourself and those you are racing/riding with at risk by continuing to use broken equipment. Depending on the age of your shifters, Shimano equipment can be mixed and matched so if the price of replacement at the highest level is too much you can look into replacing with Ultegra or 105 without noticing a great dip in performance. 

This is a hypothetical question but I'm curious. Assuming an endless, freshly paved road with no turns, what would be my maximum speed? EDIT My question is too general so to help I'm adding some extra assumptions: 

I'd recommend hitting up a local bike shop for recumbent bike options. Since product availability is pretty location specific, only this general advice is helpful. Even recommending a particular website may not be helpful depending on your country of residence. Regarding handle bars: your entire position on your bike is going to have changed in the 10 years of recovery (welcome back!). Getting your bike professionally fitted is well worth looking into. I did so after getting hit by a car. Not all bike shops offer this service though so it may require some searching online to find a place that offers fitting. Generally speaking, you will probably find a more upright position more comfortable. That means raising your handlebars and possibly pushing your seat forward. Raising your handlebars can be done with spacers as well as purchasing a new stem with a steeper angle. It's best to get these options dialed in in real-time with a professional that you can give immediate feed back to. Regarding handlebars specifically, refer to @Criggie's comment. Handlebars are generally system specific and would require more than just swapping the bars.
