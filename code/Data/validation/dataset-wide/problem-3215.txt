The biggest ships ever created are the oil super tankers. There is a famous book published in 1978 called "Supertankers!" which is all about these ships and is very interesting. The biggest ship ever was the supertanker Seawise Giant. Progress in ship size has generally been pretty gradual, so there have not been many big leaps. One notable ship from the past was the Oceanic which was the largest ship in the world from 1899 to 1901. 

There are shafts only in the largest pyramid and none have been found in the others. The shafts actually make strange and irregular turns at various points, so there is no single "angle" or visage at a particular location in the sky. The depictions you see in books are idealized. The mode of construction of the shafts is utilitarian and they seem to have some as-yet undiscovered mechanical function. The design and execution of the shafts is consistent with an engineering purpose, not a ceremonial purpose. 

The green and violet is Roman; red, blue, yellow and orange Gaelighe. Although the large number of green dots suggest Rome might have controlled most of Wales, this is not the case. The solid line of control were the "castles" (the violet dots on the right), which were Chester, Wroxeter, Lanchester (mispelled as "Kanchester" in the map) and Gloucester. The other forts were in "allied" territory, which was semi-autonomous and not under full control (hence the need for lots of forts). The orange line of "Offa's Dyke" (a structure of uncertain history, shown on the map) shows where Roman authority more or less ended. The Gaels were very keen to control the area because there are a lot of tin mines there, which is needed to make bronze, their main weapon material. 

This is kind of an off-topic question because any answer will be a matter of opinion, but I guess I will take a stab at it. First of all, Indian mathematics was very advanced in some regards and we ended up borrowing elements of it (via the Arabs), such as the use of "Arabic" numerals, which are actually of Indian origin. Indian computation of planetary orbits was far, far ahead of Ptolemaic computations. All of this was obliterated during the Mongol invasions in the 14th century, however, so it is hard to say how they would have done if uninterrupted. Following on this, primitive civilizations are capable of advanced technology. For example, the Mayan calendar is very sophisticated and is arguably much more flexible and accurate than our own Gregorian calendar. Also, it was invented many hundreds of years before the Gregorian calendar. So, what we are really after is net civilization--the totality of advancement, because in any one field anyone can be dominant if they apply themselves. If we examine successful civilizations, we notice three key things: (1) they rise and fall, the power centers move around over time (2) they tend to occur where useful resources are located (3) military dedication, attitude and approach is often innovative and superior Based on this it would seem environment is very important. For example, early on the river valley civilizations (Nile, Euphrates) were paramount, but later on civilizations in more mineralized areas were stronger. There seems to be a symbiosis betweeen local resources and current needs. For example, countries that now have a lot of oil tend to be growing faster, ceteris paribus, than those that do not. For example, Sierra Leone, Turkmenistan and South Sudan have high growth rates now due to recently-discovered oil. Then there is a military factor. Often large civilizations are created by a small, highly-motivated nucleus of warriors. For example, the Latins, the Macedonians and the Seljuk Turks. All three started in sheltered locations adjacent to rich old civilizations they could grow at the expense of. For example, the Latins sheltered in a large swamp (Latium was originally a big swamp), and over time pillaged and fed off of the Etruscans. The success of Europe, a relatively small area of the world, would seem to be a combination of these elements: proximity to resources of the type needed by current technology, nearness to existing rich civilizations, and a terrain that favors creation of nuclear warrior groups. One indication that supports these ideas is that China had difficulty in communication of civilization. For example, many regions of China, such as Sichuan, were in a primitive, almost neolithic state at the same time that other parts were in the bronze age and progressing rapidly. This shows that there was difficulty in communicating and spreading civilization there. 

The principle of ring rolling (from the Wikipedia) One possible invention that may have made this possible is ring rolling. This is a technique for forging a ring of steel and results in a very strong loop. This would be the first step in making a steel stirrup that would be strong enough. Unfortunately, little is known about ancient forging techniques, but if ring rolling was invented at this time, then that would explain the appearance of the stirrup. 

There were a lot more than 300 Greeks at the Battle of Thermopylae. The 300 were just the Spartan contingent. According to Herodotus the whole Greek army had about 5,000 men in it from all parts of Greece. 

This subject is covered in detail in the Wikipedia on the Pythia. I have not read any ancient account that describes the Oracle as speaking "gibberish". They commonly speak of the Oracle giving hints and riddles, or saying mysterious or ambiguous things, not gibberish. The account of Strabo circa 10 B.C. reads as follows: 

The effects on the South from the war and the military occupation afterwards were devastating and permanently debilitating. That is what Paisley was singing about. You will not get many honest answers about this because even today, 150 years later, the military occupation of the South is a taboo subject that is completely whitewashed in American history textbooks that confine that themselves to a canon of three standard subjects which are carpet bagging, Jim Crow laws and the KKK. The official propaganda line on all three subjects compares with any Soviet propaganda or worse in terms of sheer lies and misrepresentations. I am not going to go into that further, however, because your question is about long lasting effects of occupation. I lived briefly in Atlanta in the 1980s, and I can tell you that the downtown might be all glass skyscrapers, but if you went anywhere outside the downtown or Buckhead suburb, to one of the 5 counties surrounding it like Cobb County and Fulton, there is nothing but dust, junked out cars, and people in poverty. Driving through those areas it always seemed like they were still in the middle of Civil War. After the war the North kept up their economic blockade of the South and this was the main thing which has impoverished them. In the South there were actually "export tariffs", that means you have to pay money to export a good. You may have heard of "tariffs", normally they are taxes on goods coming INTO a country. The North actually put tariffs on goods going out as well as in, basically a blockade. They also used sleazy, backhanded tricks to choke off the South after the war. For example, one trick was mandating so-called "quarantines" on all the southern ports. This meant ANY ship entering the port would be held at gunpoint and forced to stay there for THREE WEEKS before it could leave or transact business. Obviously, you hardly need to use tariffs to block trade when you can just "quarantine" ships. Because of this, most goods had to be shipped by rail (controlled by northerners of course) to New York for export, which was expensive and economically devastating--essentially condemning the South to poverty for decades because it had no freedom of trade. Another crushing oppression of the South that has crippled it even today was the destruction of all the printing presses to prevent a record of their oppression from being published. After the North occupied the South, they put all the newspapers out of business and required "licenses" to operate, only allowing a tiny handful of newspapers which were carpet baggers' rags to exist. In some cases they even burned out newspapers or printers, just to make sure they were gone. Because of this, the entire publishing industry of the South was completely annihilated. Ironically, the few newspaper articles about the post-war oppression were all published in the North. Even today, there are very few publishers in the south. Another consequence of the occupation was the routine burning and destruction of anything in the South that might have value. For example, Alexandria, a large city in Virginia was captured by the North during the war and fortified by them. After the war when the troops were due to leave the city, rather than return the property in the city to its owners, the Northerners looted it and burned it to the ground as they left. This practice was general throughout the South. The Northerners stole whatever was saleable and shipped it to the North and burned or destroyed what they could not transport. This resulted in virtually every factory and business in the South being destroyed. Since technology takes many years to develop, this destruction made the South into a permanently backward part of the country, hopelessly behind in technology. The human cost was devastating as well. I probably do not need to describe to you what happened to the women of the South during the occupation. The harm of such things are impossible to quantify and long-lasting beyond material loss.
