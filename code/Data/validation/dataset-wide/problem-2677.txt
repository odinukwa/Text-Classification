This presupposes first that there is God or a god to talk to. Also, to forward the argument, let's assume that it is actually best not to attempt to pray/talk to God. So, how would anyone know this? First one would have to have a worldview/theology in which to understand the purpose of talking to God. If God himself doesn't command us not to talk to him, we would have to understand it from the teachings or theology of the worldview we had. For example, the Christian religion gives many examples of prayer, and teaches that people should pray - for example, the disciples asked Jesus "Teach us how to pray" - and he obliged them. Jesus himself is described as praying many times and then is described as giving us an example of how to live, so clearly Christianity would not fit into this mold - it argues for believers to pray and have a relationship with God and/or Jesus. Other worldviews may not come to this view, but that would be determined through their assumptions about God and the world, and would need to be determined through investigation into their teachings and practice. For example, my understanding of Buddhism is that you do not pray in the sense that you talk to God, but you do meditate, which is intended to further one's spiritual life, but apart from God/god(s). This is based on Buddhism's understanding of the world and what our purpose as humans is in the world. So, in the end, the idea of whether you should or need to talk to God or pray just flows naturally from an understanding of a worldview or religion. Even in the case that God himself, or one of his prophets, specifically tells you to pray or not to pray, that will be a command that is based on the presuppositions and framework of a specific religion or worldview only, and other worldviews would not be bound to it. You still would need to choose which worldview that you wish to subscribe to in order to understand the application of your question to yourself. 

A few years ago I was invited to participate in a workshop hosted by the EC on fundamental research in software engineering. I remember Wolfgang Emmerich from University College London talking about their Impact project, which had found evidence that most innovations in industry are traceable to academic research, but only after some time has passed. The report from the workshop with the details can be found here. 

I work in the field of information systems and cultural heritage. A significant part of my work is related to the description of things that are of interest to cultural heritage specialists such as archaeologists or anthropologists. These things include objects such as paintings, tools or utensils; structures such as buildings or caves; places such as mountains or towns; etc. Most of the time, the things we need to describe are real, i.e. we can perceive them through our senses and thus give a conventional account of them. However, sometimes we need to deal with things (of the above mentioned kinds) that are imaginary, such as Atlantis (an imaginary place) or Excalibur (the sword which Merlin supposedly got from the Lady of the Lake). The consensus between researchers seem to be that a sword is a sword is a sword, and thus imaginary swords are described in terms of their purported physical properties, use, chronology and other attributes very much like any real sword. Of course, one would note down that this particular sword happens to be imaginary, and one should not expect to find it in a museum. However, places are trickier to deal with. The essence of a place seems to be its spatial location, and imaginary places often lack that, i.e. they don't have a well-defined or known location. For this reason, researchers rarely describe imaginary places in the same terms as they would describe real places. Rather, they use accessory attributes (such as what happened there or who lived there) instead of their physical location in the world. After thinking for a while about this, I am wondering about the nature of imaginary things. For objects (such as the sword in my example), imaginary and real don't seem to differ that much. For places, however, the difference is crucial. So my question is, are there any works on the ontology (and/or epistemology) of the imaginary that I can look at? Are there any mainstream or accepted takes on this problem? Thank you. 

Note that if we are to make that evaluation (and I am convinced we are not properly equipped to do so), we have no idea what other factors are involved. For example, is God mitigating evil already so that it is not as bad as it might have been? Also, this doesn't take into the equation any metaphysical considerations about individual accounting for deeds done in this life, heaven/hell or any other considerations of this life compared to the afterlife. If you are going to "weigh the evil" and define an amount that is "too much", it really needs to be an equation which weighs all factors, in which case we need more information to solve for "x". 

Edit: the answers so far seem to want to redefine theology or other terms - that is fine, but please be clear that you are redfining them, and provide, if possible, sources for why the term should be different than given (support from historical works, other sites, etc.). 

This question mixes the action of the will with the original desire or choice of the will to attempt to carry out an action over time. Assuming: 

Counter-Factuals (CFs) are possible actions. But all possible actions are not guaranteed to be actualizable actions. They miss a piece of Plantinga's argument which they even quote: ".. he will take at least one wrong action" 

A compatibilist would argue that the person is always moving or not moving according to their own motivations in each of your circumstances - but, of course, limited by the constraints of his situation. Given Scenario #6 - a person not moving even though he will drown, because someone threatens his family - this person must obviously value the lives of his family more than his own life, factoring in his belief that the threat is real. If you put 100 people in this situation, some would move and some would not. Some would resist until the water got to a certain level. A compatibilist would claim that all of them were acting in concert with their true composite motivation at every moment that they acted. The person in #1 (restrained from moving by shackles) is also acting based on his motivation at the moment, given the real, physical constraints of his situation. This person might have given up all hope, or he may be struggling wildly to break free of the shackles and escape. Whichever one he or she is doing, it is because of a grand combination of both his or her internal and external inputs, filtered through his internal lens of motivation based on all inputs - physical senses, emotions, internal conscious thought, etc. 

I think there are two related but distinct issues involved in your question. First, there is the issue of compositionality, i.e. defining something in terms of its constituent parts. Then, there is the issue of semantic holism, by which you cannot define something unless you have defined something else, and thus you can never reach a proper definition of the original concept, since you would need to have a complete understanding of the whole language. This is a strong form of semantic holism, and as far as I know it has been strongly criticised, since sense can be constructed through mechanisms other than mere composition, such as contextual and pragmatic information. 

A property of a part is not necessarily a property of the whole. For example, a page in a book has a page number, but the book itself does not have a page number. In your example, the fact that we (the part) have a property (the intention of discovery) does not imply that the whole (the universe) has that property too. I should add to this the fact that intentions need agency. And I would dispute strongly that the universe, as such, has it. 

Deontic logic is concerned with what is optional, recommended, forbidden, etc. Doxastic logic, on the other hand, is about beliefs. I would argue that policies (as per the OP) can be expressed by using deontic logic and perhaps doxastic logic as well if you want to capture actual adherence to stated policies. As a practical example, ISO/IEC 24744, a standard language for the description of methodologies, uses deontic markers to express whether specific tasks are compulsory, recommended, optional, discouraged or forbidden. 

I think the answer to your question is yes. There is a significant amount of work around the study of time in ontology. The old endurantism vs. perdurantism debate is part of this. A good example is Sider's "Four-Dimensionalism: An Ontology of Persistence and Time". 

If this is within the bounds of proper philosophy, then how is it categorized? Philosophy of ... Life? Are there any specific technical terms to describe them? And then, of course, do you have any quotes or sources of historical philosophers treating this particular aspect of philosophy (assuming that it is...)? 

There is a good summary of the Problem of Other Minds here at Standford's Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Although I don't believe they really pick up on the true application of the problem of other minds, which is determining if I can trust the objectivity of the world I perceive. I'm coming to the conclusion that the problem of other minds needs to be understood as a trivial problem. And it really is better stated as "Do I perceive an objective world?" Some of the possibilities: 

The Questions: 1) Is any definition of objective reality really just a democracy or vote which is relying on the most popular perception? 2) If #1 is true, doesn't this just mean that reality is truly subjective, just there may be larger and smaller populations of people that basically agree on the same nature of reality? 3) If #1 is false, then how can it be explained that ideas like logic, empirical data from the 5 senses, the scientific method, and any other basis used to determine objective reality is true outside of an individual's perception of both these ideas and the other observers needed to verify them? 

Logically, it is a paradoxical statement. Paradoxical statements do not describe real situations or occurrences. They cannot be evaluated to either true or false because the thing they describe, according to the laws of logic, are not possible. Therefore "always is always wrong" is a nonsensical statement. It is not true, false, not-true, or not-false. It is paradoxical and describes nothing that is comprehensible. If you wish to allow irrationality to exist, of course, then it can exist - we just can make no statement definitive statement about it at all, as it does not conform to the existence/universe that we have knowledge of.
