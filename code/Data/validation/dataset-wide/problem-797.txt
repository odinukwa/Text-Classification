At least 7. We currently know of two star systems with 7 stars: Nu Scorpii and AR Cassiopeiae. The two have different structures, both of which are complicated but appear to be stable on stellar timescales. Nu Scorpii This system has two components, Nu Scorpii AB and Nu Scorpii CD. 

These are not the only methods of detecting black holes (other effects, such as frame dragging around a Kerr black hole, offer distinctive descriptions of the black hole), but are rather straightforward 1-4 can also be signs of other compact objects such as white dwarfs and neutron stars, and are often only found in binary systems. Only by using a multitude of different observations, and careful analysis, can an object finally be designated a black hole. 

Pulsar kicks originating from supernovae can impart neutron stars with speeds of 100-500 km/s, often at or close to the escape velocity of the Milky Way. Even if a pulsar fails to escape the galaxy, it can be launched into unusual orbits. Assuming that the velocity distribution is isotropic, a decent fraction of such pulsars should have large orbital inclinations after the kicks, such that they rise above the galactic plane. I have two questions regarding this: 

So it's actually a theory to explain a phenomenon. Dark energy, on the other hand, is an experimental phenomenon. We don't have a good theory to explain it. But it's a phenomenon responsible for many different problems. There's quite a lot of evidence that says, "Something odd is going on." What I mean by all this is that there's a heck of a lot of evidence for them. Our theories of them were created to explain evidence, and not vice versa (evidence gathered to support or refute a theory). 

Any giants that lie inside the frost line in stellar systems most likely migrated inwards after interactions with the protoplanetary disk or, as happened in our Solar System (but didn't cause Jupiter to move that far inwards), with other giant planets. The Nice model describes such incidents 

It's simple - there is no edge to the universe. It is thought that the universe is infinite in size. Data from WMAP seems to support this, because it shows that the universe is very close to "flat" - i.e. the overall curvature is zero. This does support the "infinite universe" models. That said, there is an edge to our (or any other observer's) observable universe. This consists of all the objects we can see - or, rather, all the objects whose emitted light, gravity, or other effects we can detect. There isn't anything special going on at the edge of our observable universe, either, for those observers there. Nothing special happens for them, although any observer's observable universe is expanding. 

The current explanation for this is something called the frost line (which changes over time). At greater distances from the Sun, a body will receive less and less radiation, and so it will be colder than if it were closer to the Sun. Eventually, conditions become cold enough for volatiles to condense into grains. These volatiles make it possible for large-scale accretion to happen, and thus giant planets are formed. They may become gas giants (like Jupiter and Saturn) or ice giants (like Uranus and Neptune), depending on the composition of the protoplanetary disk at a given distance. A graphic (from here) gives a better summary, although it's copyrighted. 

Believe it or not, Jupiter isn't too consistent. Take a look at these pictures, the first taken in 2009 and the second taken in 2010: 

Short answer: Sort of Long answer: One week before the encounter, Wikipedia says no. The comet's nucleus will pass by Mars at a distance somewhere of about 139,000 km from the center of Mars - way too far for any predicted collision. The main tail of the comet, too, will most likely miss Mars by about "10 Mars diameters" - roughly 64,000 km. However, small quantities of dust particles could (and most likely will) stray away from the main tail and hit Mars, Deimos and Phobos. This graphic gives a good picture of the encounter: 

Still, that does put a deadline for the Earth and the Moon to evolve to the point you're looking for. Wikipedia addresses the possibility that the Earth and Moon survive: 

This is the case studied in Kozai (1962), specifically, the case of asteroids being perturbed by Jupiter. While not massless, the difference in mass is large enough that the asteroid's mass is negligible. 

In other words, it seems like a basic approximation of the orbit was created, and the astronomers looked at images taken of areas near where the asteroid should have been, according to the calculations. The calculations could then be refined, and further previous sightings could be investigated. 

All of this led to much lower uncertainties in parameter observations in Spitzer's data alone; combined with Kepler's observations, the uncertainties were reduced even further. Period estimates and transit depths, for instance, saw significant improvement. Finally, the authors recommend that the system be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. That won't be launched for another two years, but I suspect its versatility over various wavelengths will better constrain data from EPIC 201367065 and other systems. Crossfield et al. (2015) say that the James Webb Space Telescope has the capability to detect spectral signs in the atmospheres of the planets, based on certain models (Hubble could also observe them). I don't think JWST has been assigned specific targets that include this system, but that's just a guess. In the case of the first system measured by Beichman et al., EPIC 202083828, ground-based telescopes could also give more information about spectroscopy to rival JWST, according to Schlieder et al. (2016). Perhaps EPIC 201367065 could also be observed by these telescopes. 

Is there a large - i.e. noticeable - population of such neutron stars, distinguishable by modern telescopes, or is the fraction of total neutron stars relatively small? Does observing a pulsar - at any wavelength - in such an orbit have any advantages over observing an identical pulsar firmly in the galactic disk? I would assume that some kicks could propel them high enough that scattering along the line of sight could be lessened, leading to a smaller dispersion measure smearing, and could also isolate the pulsars from ambient radio sources in the disk, such as a the galactic center. 

"Nebula" is quite an imprecise word; over the years, it's been applied to everything from interstellar dust clouds to supernova remnants to the birthplaces of stars to even galaxies. Wikipedia separates true nebulae into four categories: H II regions, planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and dark nebulae. In this case, it might be better to make the distinction between nebulae that primarily surround on star/star system and nebulae that exist in interstellar space, potentially encompassing many stars. Circumstellar nebulae I'll classify planetary nebulae and supernova remnants as circumstellar nebulae. They're both the result of a star passing into the final phase of its life. Planetary nebulae (which include the Cat's Eye Nebula) are the remains of the outer layers of gas given off by relatively low-mass stars, like the Sun. Balick & Frank (2002) subdivide these based on morphology, into four categories: 

I might as well write up my comment into an answer. One of my new favorite tools in my equations toolkit is the formula for effective temperature: $$T=\left( \frac{L(1-a)}{16 \pi \sigma D^2} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}}$$ where $T$ is the temperature of the planet, $L$ is the star's luminosity, $a$ is the planet's albedo, $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $D$ is the distance between the star and the planet. To find the star's luminosity, simply solve for $L$: $$L=\frac{T^4 16 \pi \sigma D^2}{1-a}$$ where all the terms are for the first planet (Mars). Now, knowing $D$ for Earth, solve for $T$ on Earth. All you have to know for this that isn't in the question is albedo. That could be tricky, because it's not given. You could assume that it's the same for both planets - and so solve not for $L$ but for $L(1-a)$ - but that might not be better than an approximation. 

First, imagine that you're in an inertial reference frame. We can think of this as a sort of lattice throughout space, with a synchronized clock at each lattice point in space. Now imagine two events, $A$ and $B$, which occur at space-time coordinates $(t_A, x_A, y_A, z_A)$ and $(t_B, x_B, y_B, z_B)$. The reference frame has (again, synchronized) clocks at $(x_A, y_A, z_A)$ and $(x_B, y_B, z_B)$. The coordinate time $\Delta t_{AB}$ is the difference in time measured by the clock at $B$ and the clock at $A$, so that $\Delta t_{AB}=t_B-t_A$. If $\Delta t_{AB}=0$, the events are simultaneous in that reference frame. However, an observer in a different inertial frame (say, in one with a boost $\vec{\beta}$ in the $x$-direction) might measure a different $\Delta t_{AB}$. This means that coordinate time is frame-dependent - it depends on the reference frame you're in. Proper time is sometimes called "wristwatch time". Now, there's a single clock, and it measures the time between two events $A$ and $B$ on a single worldline. This proper time $\tau_{AB}$ does not depend on your reference frame, but it does depend on the path you take from $A$ to $B$ - that is, it's path-dependent. One way to think of the difference is that coordinate time tells you something about one reference frame relative to another (because it's frame-dependent), while proper time tells you something about the worldline of the observer (because it's path dependent). 

The Yarkovsky effect is responsible for changes in the rotation and orbit of some celestial bodies, most notably asteroids. It has been measured on asteroids, such as 6489 Golevka and 1999 RQ36. What is the largest object on which the Yarkovsky effect has been observed? Scholarpedia has an excellent article and list of asteroids, but the list isn't necessarily complete, and I don't know if the effect has been detected on other (non-asteroid) bodies.
