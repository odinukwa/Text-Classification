We can try to apply this theorem to our problem by taking $x$ to be $i$, $c$ to be $y$, $F(i,c,c')=c^\theta$ and $G(i,c,c')=pc$. Then the final differential equation in the theorem becomes $$\theta c_i^{\theta-1} + \lambda p_i=0$$ which is precisely what we need. Is the theorem applicable? Our $K[y]$ is linear, so cannot have an extremal, so the requirement of not having an extremal is easily satisfied. The boundary conditions on $y(a)$ and $y(b)$ do not matter since if a path of $c$, say $c^*(i)$, is extremal without any boundary conditions then it is extremal within the set $c(0)=c^*(0), c(1)=c^*(1)$. The only catch is in the nature of the theorem itself. It gives necessary conditions for an optimum. Given that in our case the necessary condition gives a unique result, all that we need to make it sufficient is to argue that our problem has a solution. The proofs in Kolmogorov-Fomin assume that the functions we are dealing with have continuous first derivatives. So we still need to show that the consumer's problem has an optimal in this class of functions but given that the problem is solved. 

It seems to me that this definition is not completely equivalent to the usual definition of the Nash equilibrium as a strategy profile where each player's strategy is a best response to the strategies of the others. The usual definition says nothing about beliefs and therefore allows for the possibility that beliefs might be incorrect. To take a trivial possibility, consider the Prisoner's Dilemma. Suppose each player believes that the other player will not confess. Since confessing is a dominant strategy each player would still confess. So the actions constitute a Nash equilibrium even though the players' beliefs are completely the opposite of the actual equilibrium actions. Am I right in this understanding that Osborne's definition characterizes something other than Nash's equilibrium? 

Someone can probably answer that question better than I could., but let us give a try nonetheless. Let us consider that we have an independent market between the US and the UK and that the values of their respective money is only depending on that market. That is no influence outside those two countries will be considered. At this market, the exchange rate between the pounds and the dollars is a consequence of the buying and selling of dollars against pounds. If we further simplify, supposing that no government, currency speculation, or otherwise take place, we can reduce the exchange rate to be a consequence of the commercial balance between those two countries. The more the US import, the more the pound/dollar ratio increases. And the more they export, the more the ratio decreases. Now, we consider that the prices in the UK rises as an effect of the inflation. The US inflation on the same period is 0. At first, the exchange rate was unchanged. Export goods are kept at the same price (no inflation in the US and constant exchange rate). However import goods are more expensive due to the inflation. This favours the US export in comparison to its import. As a consequence, there is a higher demand of US goods in the UK (cheaper) and a lower demand of UK goods in the US. The effect is a fall of the pound in comparison to the dollar. It can be seen in another way, the acquisition power of the pound has lowered due to the inflation, and the exchange rate reflects that against the non-inflated dollar. As a consequence, the prices of the US exported goods will rise, whereas the prices of the UK exported goods will lower. This will re-establish the variation of demand and offer caused by the inflation to what it was before, but with a new echange rate, reflecting the new acquisition power of the pound. This is a theoretical illustration of the self-regulation of the market. 

I would submit that the premise is flawed. There is no methodological criteria that unified the Chicago school and separates it from the rest of economics. I think this is true even for Friedman, whose methodological paper you refer to. If you look at his macroeconomic work such as his Monetary History of the United States, Theory of the Consumption Function or his famous presidential address to the AEA,there is nothing in it which is different from the methodology of mainstream economics. I think the same can be said about Stigler's work on industrial organization. The Chicago School was united by its institutional links and its faith in capitalism and not by a distinctive method. And it would be wrong to think of the School as a homogenous entity. See for example this article by Patinkin on the diversity of views on the quantity theory of money: $URL$ 

Loeb spaces have been used to model situations with a continuum of agents. See $URL$ and the chapters by Sun on economic applications in the book Nonstandard Analysis for the Working Mathematician. 

With just one producer my guess would have been that the producer would always like a retail price war since a more competitive retail sector would reduce the double-marginalization problem and hence allow the producer to capture more profits. Is this intuition right? And how does moving from monopoly to oligopoly in production change things? This question comes from a real-world observation. This Diwali (which is to Indian retailers what Christmas is to western ones) there was an intense price war among online retailers in India. In response to this price war, many producers of consumer durables like TVs and cameras made public statements against this price war and actively discouraged consumers from buying from these online retailers by measures such as offering longer warranties for products bought from brick-and-mortar stores. A simple explanation for this behavior is that this was just to appease the brick-and-mortar stores which still dominate Indian retail. But could there be a deeper explanation? One story I could think of was as follows: suppose that the price charged by producers to retailers is not directly observed. Then a retailer price war can make it harder to detect a cut in the producer-to-retailer price. This can cause any implicit price collusion between the producers to break down, something which none of the producers would like to happen. But I'm sure this is not the only possible explanation. 

This is a rather broad definition and equity can take on different forms. E.g., for a house, it is the difference between the market value of the house and the mortgage still owned by the owner. In the context of a company balance sheet, we usually talk about Shareholder's equity, which, as Wikipedia puts it 

I think it's going to be hard to compare the price for a country with a large internal creditors and another one without, as such a price depends on many parameters apart from that. But to answer the core of your question, it does have an influence. In many European countries, the public debt is considered a huge problem since the 2007-2008 crisis at it reaches the 100% of GDP. And it is a problem because, those countries have to spend a huge amount of the GDP to pay back that debt, with interests. They can't default without having much higher prices (see Greece, Spain or Italy around 2010). The 100% of GDP is a virtual barrier that is considered critical by many investors or specialised press. In contrast, a country with a large part of national creditors, Japan, currently run with 217% of its GDP debt. Yet the market for the government bonds in Japan is quite stable. This might crudely be explained by a link between the two elements of the debt. National have all interests that their own government functions. If their own government has money, they can invest in their economy, which profits directly the investors. If the investors are abroad, they would be less affected by a slow down or a crash or the economy, and thus ask for higher prices to compensate for the risk of defaults. 

Let $y$ be the proportion in $[0,1]$ instead of the percentage. I think the issues here are possible nonlinearity and censoring. You can try including quadratic terms on the right hand side. At the same time, you can try the following models. I. Linear models: If no $y$ is exactly 0 or 1, linear models will be OK. The following four options come to my mind. 

In general, if $c_1$ is endogenous, you need instruments for $c_1$ as well. Example: Even when $x_1$ is exogenous, if $c_1$ is endogenous and $x_1$ and $c_1$ are correlated, then OLS (which is the IV estimator using $x_1$ as IV for $x_1$) is generally inconsistent. Exceptions exist. For example, when exactly identified, if $(Ezc') (Ecc')^{-1} (Ecu)=0$, then your IV estimator is consistent, I guess. (Can derive this using standard technique involving the law of large numbers.) 

II. Tobit models: If some $y$ are exactly 0 or 1, you can try Tobit models ( in Stata). Remember that normality is assumed for the error term before censoring. Also, using Tobit models means that "I think $y$ could be bigger than 1 (smaller than 0) if not censored." 

You can also statistically test heteroskedasticity (e.g., White's test: regress squared residuals from OLS on $\hat{y}$ and $\hat{y}^2$, or if you have a simple model, regress $\hat{u}^2$ on $x$ and $x^2$). It's unclear what you mean by your "model having heteroskedasticity" (do you mean the error term is heteroskedastic?) and "impacting the prediction". You can always choose to ignore heteroskedasticity if you want. (You seem to do so, as you mentioned OLS.) Or you can have a different estimator (e.g., WLS) for a better (sometimes only slightly better) predictor using the same model. Or you can even have a model that incorporates heteroskedasticity explicitly as in, for example, GARCH models in time series. Please be more specific if you want more help.
