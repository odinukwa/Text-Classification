I see no bike - I see some scrap metal that used to be a bike, and could be a bike again if you add the missing parts. Clearly visible is a 1 piece ashtabula crank which is not a high quality design. Also there is no reinforcement gusset between the top and down tubes so its not built for impacts or stunting. Whoever told you it was valuable was probably selling it. Might become more valuable as petrol costs rise. If the chrome is in good condition and there is no rust, then you can have a ridable and usable bike for a back-wheel, tyre, tube, freewheel+cog, chain, brake pads, and possibly some brake cable. I'm not quite sure what the thing on the downtube is - originally thought it was a cantilever from the front but it might be part of the rear brake mech. If your location in the world requires two independent brakes you will need to fit a front brake as well to be legal, as well as any reflectors or bell or whatever is mandated by law. 

Not an easy solution, but you can use a photocopier to measure wear on chainrings. This doesn't tend to work with cassettes cos they're thicker. First, remove the worn chainring from the bike, and clean it well to keep oils off the copier's glass and undercover. Then photocopy it at 1:1 size. Flip the chainring and lay it on top of your copy, so that the bolt holes align. There will be at least one position where the teeth line up. Then trace around the rear of a tooth. Remove chainring and visually compare the overlaps, and then use a caliper to measure the differences for a numeric result. 

If you want to keep the steel wheels, you need to remove the rust and stop it coming back. For Pinheads of Rust 

One solution for getting the load off the bike is to tow it in a trailer. This would be overkill if you're carting around a waterbottle and a pocket of keys, but if you're loading the bike with 20+ kilos (44+ pounds) of stuff then moving it to its own axle could help. Downside, trailers aren't cheap, and they will slow you down while riding. 

Finally, consider not carrying the thing at all - I have a work computer and a home computer and I do not move either one about. Instead I use VPN over the internet to control one from the other, should the need arise. 

Answer: Its not worth doing, from a financial stand point. Adding disk brakes to a frame is expensive, risky, and ruins any vintage value the frame had. The stays are not engineered or designed for the new sideways loading. Also, you talk about stays, but braking on the rear wheel is nowhere near as good as braking on the front. If you're dead-keen on fitting disks to this frame, then a better solution is to buy a new front fork with disk mounts, a new front wheel or hub with disk mounts, a front caliper and rotor, new cable/hose, and a new brake lever that suits. Keep the old fork and parts too, that way you can revert to original spec for no cost. If you want a disk brake bike for bad weather, buy a second-hand MTB and fit mudguards, leaving your loverly vintage bike for rides. 

Coming at it from the other side - is it even possible to buy them separately ? And following that - if you can buy a left and a right single separately, the pricing might still make it uneconomical. 

"shifting under load" is considered worse for the drive train, but if you have to do it then its not the end of the world. Shifting halfway up a climb is okay, but you do have to back-off the pedal pressure for a half-revolution. This is the same for Derailleur and IGB bikes when shifting to a bigger/easier cog. Derailleur bikes can't shift while coasting, you have to be moving the chain to shift it. Internally Geared Hubs can shift while coasting or stopped. When to shift should be to keep your pedal revolutions in a comfortable range. For most people that's somewhere between 60 and 90 RPM, with higher values for speedy types. 

So your 2.35" tyre is 59mm moving to 2.4" which is 61mm. Chart suggests your rim will be fine. TL;DR your frame is the limiting factor, not the rim. 

Continuing to pedal is another important safety suggestion. Cars more-so will have a harder time seeing you as a moving object if you're just sitting over the bike. If you're pedalling you look more like a moving thing. Don't just potato-sack on the bike. Legal - your location may regulate maximum power. For me I can have up to 300W of electric or 49cc of petrol power+pedals wuithout having to register. As soon as the bike hits 301W or 50cc or looses its pedals, then its a motorbike requiring registration and WOF etc. Find the legal limits and don't exceed them. 

Answer Your bottom bracket is stuffed. The cheap AND the correct fix is to replace it outright. All I found on the web was that this bike has an "external bearing system" bottom bracket, which could be any of 9 different standards. The replacement has to match the crank interface too, which could be ISIS, Octalink, or square taper. 

Sounds like you have a ~60mm stem Quill stems are available in lengths from 20mm up to over a hundred mm. Your other option is to rotate the handlebars so they get a bit closer, or possibly pull your saddle further forward on its rails. These might be worth trying anyway - they're free fixes and you can always revert. If you want, you could replace your quill stem with a quill/threadless adapter and then fit a modern stem. There are many more threadless stems available nowdays, including adjustable ones which might suit you. 

Its a combo SPD and touring pedal, so one side for MTB cleats and the other side is flat for the times you can't be bothered putting on your riding shoes. The manual may be found here $URL$ and the exploded view is $URL$ 

I have one that looks pretty similar. If you undo three pin clamps the top rail folds down to one side, then both sides fold flat onto the bed. I'd look for a light piece of marine-grade plywood to go on top of this. Fit a square of wooden battens around the edge and fit some hose clamps over the rails from below, and screw into battens. Optionally fit some low sides to help hold stuff on the tray, but this will increase windage. Or look for a plastic baker's bread tray instead, the sort loaves are delivered to the shop. Its your call whether you want the sides to stay be up and slot the cargo tray between the uprights. This would give somewhere to mount lights and reflectors and maybe even a chopper flag. If you remove the uprights completely, then the frame will be weak and the tray will be required to supply bracing strength. Carry at least one spare 20" tube at all times, build this into the plans. My trailer has a third wheel and a pram handle too, so it becomes a giant kids pushchair. If I was shopping, I could push it around the supermarket instead of a trolley. 

Not really - you could secret your keys into the handlebars or into the seat tube, but anyone watching would figure out what you're doing. Best thing to do is take as little as possible, but as much as you need. If you run with a water bottle, look for one that has a pocket like this: 

Bikes break because they've been either mistreated or not cared for. Riding a bike down stairs should be okay provided you don't fall off or catch anything.... that's what a MTB is built for. Proper care and maintenance keeps everything working, so lubrication and washing off mud/silt etc will keep the bike functioning. Storing your bike inside out of the weather is the single best thing you can do to preserve it and extend its life. If your question was about a road bike or a hybrid/commuter, I'd say stairs would be outside the normal usage for such a frame. Finally, every bike needs to change gear while going uphill. The only trick is timing, to get the chain to move cogs/chainrings while at the top of the stroke where the pressure is less. If you're changing gear with the pedal cranks horizontal then that's sub-optimal and bad for the transmission. This question is likely to generate various opinions. 

An average bike trailer might add 5-10 kilos to the weight of a bike, while not zero its also a small amount of the overall system mass. How do the dynamics of the combination change, as the weight of the trailer + load approaches the weight of the rider + bike ? Imagine loaded trailer is half the weight of the rider and bike, and equal mass, and double the mass. This comes from a comment on Designing Bike Trailers – Especially the hitch and load and aims for a more generic answer. 

I've just bought a project recumbent. It has no seat yet. There are many different types - why would I choose a mesh one over a solid one? 

Your 48 volt motor probably uses some modern flavour of lithium battery. It will probably refuse to run on anything less than 44-46 volts (actual numbers may differ) and this will be in the controller's manual. If you're using 12 volt SLA lead acid batteries, then they must not be discharged below 10.5 volts per battery, which would be 42 volts in your scenario. To get 48 volts, you will need 4x 12V batteries in series not parallel. 12V batteries in parallel will still only give 12 volts, just a lot more current for a lot longer. Since your motor is 48 volts it won't even start on one 12V battery. I recommend you use the fattest wires you can to link your batteries. Electric cars eschew wires in favour of busbars for added cross sectional area. If this sounds like alien gibberish, you should enlist the aid of an electrically-minded assistant. 

That's an unusual rust pattern but not impossible. Your wheel has a cloth rim strip? Those hold moisture from rain and road dampness. There's a chance your rim is not particularly waterproof, so moisture enters through the bead, possibly the spoke holes around the nipples, and maybe even through the tyre carcass. Plus there's sweating/condensation when warm and cool things meet. Plus black tyres are great at warming up due to sunlight. So warm and wet, plus possible salt can corrode even stainless steel. Spoke nipples are normally brass which doesn't corrode, but the nickel/chrome coating on the outside makes them look different. Sometimes race bikes have aluminium nipples but these are fragile and oversized and expensive. You might have plain old chromed steel nipples too, if the wheel is old enough. Grab some sandpaper and see how deep the rust is - it looks like purely surface rust in your photo. Fresh nylon rim tape sounds like a good idea, and remove the fabric or paper tape. You don't have to replace the nipples, but they're cheap. 

So if you can return the bad chainring, do so. If not, and you're willing to modify it, you could try grinding away the tabs a little. Don't bend them too much, alloy won't like being bent and you'll weaken the whole thing. Probably safest to list it on ebay and buy the right part - your LBS would be best rather than buying parts on-line. Plus if they sell you the wrong part, you can return it. 

Too much info for a comment, I've checked the suggested duplicate and this is slightly different. This question is about effort and approach, not climbing technique. 

As you can see it comes in different sizes, and shrinks by about 50% depending on the type. I use 30mm and 35mm tube on handlebars, and 1.5mm tube on inner cables. For a lock, 8mm-15mm would be about right. For going over a chain, then 20mm-30mm might be appropriate. If one layer is not enough protection, you can double up, or more! And this stuff is cheap - a metre at alibaba is perhaps 1~3 dollars plus freight.
