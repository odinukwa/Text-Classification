The novanoids and the charge that they emit will enhance some of the vacuum bubbles, and will generate spiralling or straight(ish) tunnels, as well as creating heavier elements. As novanoids are not entirely static, their bubbles and tunnels will move along with them. The discharges will generate light on a cyclical basis, forming the basis for day/night cycles. As novanoids appear and disappear, new bubbles and tunnels may form, and old tunnels and bubbles may fill or collapse. Movement of novanoids and their associated charge-tunnels occurs at a rate approximating that of continental drift, and their lifespans approximate that of geological ages to planetary lifetimes. 

Your 3g location would kill most unenhanced humans pretty quickly - in a matter of days to weeks, depending upon the starting fitness level of the human in question. The amount of extra strain that this places on the heart is quite large for any position that does not involve lying down, akin to running near-flat-out all the time, and even lying down would put pressure on the heart similar to walking constantly. In addition, lying down in these conditions would rapidly cause pressure sores that would necessitate some sort of movement. Even movement would be dangerous, a fall when standing would be equivalent to falling from a second floor balcony in 1g, and a fall when on all fours - not impossible given that the subject's effective weight would be triple normal, when humans can typically lift only their own weight to double their own weight - would be the same as a fall from their own height in 1g. It sounds like a pretty effective torture to me... 

Unlike metal or plastic, many types of rock are slightly porous, so over a long time, atmosphere could slowly leak away. This might not matter for a ship making journeys of a year or two, but over generations, there could be a significant loss of gases unless the whole interior was covered in some sort of sealer that would last generations. Another drawback of an asteroid is that there is a lot of unnecessary mass that would have to be accelerated. Better to build a ship as light as possible in order to reduce the cost of acceleration and deceleration. On the other hand, a sufficiently large asteroid would also provide good protection against interstellar radiation, and if the species manning it are sufficiently paranoid or justified, an asteroid would provide more camouflage against enemies than a manufactured ship. 

Unfortunately, aliens being alien, there are so many possible ways that signals could be transmitted around an organism that the souls couldn't realistically have a hope of being able to interface with them all. One might use electrical, the other might use chemical, the third might use light, and so on. The souls are a scientifically implausible species. Magic must be involved. 

Protecting the package is quite simple. Put it in a sealed room filled with an aerosol nerve agent such as VX that works on skin contact, such that one doesn't even have to breathe it to be poisoned. By providing the room with considerable overpressure, not only will the invading ninja be poisoned, but also anyone on or near the far side of the portal may also be poisoned by the gas passing back through the portal, just as an additional bit of discouragement. In order to ensure that the briefcase is not simply snatched by a dying ninja, put it in layer after layer of cage, so that while the ninjas may be able to cut through them or pick the modern locks if they are magically able to do so, it will take time that will allow the VX to kill them. I think after many of their number don't come back, and after the people remaining on the ninja's side of the portal begin to die too, the ninjas will get the idea that trying to snatch the briefcase is a bad, bad idea. 

That's actually pretty hard to do without some sort of tubing small enough to insert into a vein, let alone by someone who currently has lousy digital dexterity. Even if the were-jaguar had an IV tube, with those paws, he wouldn't be doing any transfusions, and without IV equipment, or only improvised equipment, there's almost no way. If you had, say, the empty part of the ink tube from a pen, you might be able to do it, but with a tube that size, using only normal blood pressure, it might take a while to transfer enough blood from the donor's arteries to the recipient's veins, but that presupposes that the were-jaguar has enough dexterity to pull the job off, which I doubt. Puncturing an artery and using blood pressure to force the donor's arterial blood into the recipient's veins using simple physical contact might sound like a practical solution, but it is likely that most of the donor's blood will end up on the ground, as blood is slippery, lining up two cuts is difficult, and the pressure required to hold the edges of the cuts together would collapse the already exsanguinated recipient's veins. 

In a situation such as the one described and commented upon, where there are no large scale outside threats that are not already being dealt with externally, and the colony can be assumed to be a single polity, then it is unlikely that any standing military force would exist in order to secure the world. Instead, there would be police/public safety force(s), responsible for the day-to-day threats associated with having a lot of people. Given the probable low population density and probable high technology, the crime rate would likely be quite low, and crimes would be fairly easy to solve, so the police force would be small. Border and internal security would be a police function, while search and rescue would fall under the jurisdiction of separate agencies such as a coast guard, ambulance service, fire-fighting service etc. Should members of these non-police agencies discover a crime in progress (such as a coast guard member discovering that the boat they just boarded for a safety inspection contained contraband), they would report it to the police - they would not be likely to have the authority to investigate on their own. 

In a competition that has a significant emphasis on physical beauty, I would anticipate that that portion of the competition would become rather less subjective than it currently is. To rely upon the judgement of biological judges would almost certainly impose species-based bias on the proceedings. It is possible in the case of humans - and should be so for any alien species for whom there are standards of physical attractiveness and who might want to participate in such a competition - to define an algorithm that can determine how closely an individual is to an ideal example of that species. Once such algorithms have been defined, the beauty portion of the competition could be judged by full body scans with the result for each competitor being obtained by mathematically deriving the individual's divergence from the ideal model. The lower the divergence, the greater the individual's score. The scores for each contestant, regardless of differences in species, could then be realistically compared. It might be interesting to note that some species, such as humans, may prefer not to appear in public without clothing. However, it may also be practical for the machinery performing the judging of the beauty to scan the unclothed bodies of the contestants without revealing images of the contestants, and only outputting the contestant's numerical score. This would be a fairer method, since - in human society at least - it can be shown that standards of beauty in clothing are highly subjective and subject to change over time, and hence much harder to derive a mathematical standard of beauty. As to other portions of the competition, these could be judged by biological judges of all species involved with the assistance of translators. It would probably be necessary to not allow the judges to know what contestant was asked what question, and only provide them the translated answer. As for the Miss part of Miss Universe, I would say that this would limit entry to those members of each species that play the greatest role in reproduction, as well as those who have not yet reproduced (This isn't Mrs. Universe, after all). Where all members of a species play an equal role, all would be eligible for entry, but where some individuals have less time/energy investment into the act of reproduction than others, only members of the gender investing the greatest amount would be eligible for entry. 

How big a lifeform could we realistically have, and in very general terms, what chemistry and body plan would it need to fulfil all of these criteria, if they can all be fulfilled? How (if at all) would it obtain additional energy for continued operations? Are Pacific Rim's kaiju realistic? Preference will be given to answers that can justify greater combat capability, longer operational durations, and a shorter production time for a given magnitude of body mass and volume. EDIT Think out of the box here, guys. Don't feel constrained to CHO chemistry or vertebrate body plans. If some sort of Von Neumann nanotech made from metal and powered by atomic reactors can be justified, run with it. Should the body resemble a starfish or a centipede or a sea urchin or something else? 

While this question is fantasy-based, this answer is reality-based in that it doesn't require that the hero know about the AI at all until after the fight has started, if at all, and doesn't require any magic or unusual equipment. As a martial artist (a red belt/4th kyu in Shotokan karate and hapkido), I have fought dan-grade black belts. The difference is not as great as many people seem to think, and is on the order of perhaps a tenth of a second and the sheer variety of things that they can do and counter. Attack a high-ranked martial artist, and it is likely that - precognition or not - they will have experienced that attack before and can defend against it. On the other hand, I have scored hits against my sensei, who is approaching the rank described in the question, however it is a matter of probability, and the probability is that for the most part, I'll be hit more often than I'll score a hit. Also, I've fought dan-grade juniors (under 16) as a red-belt and below, and as an adult in my 40s, they aren't much of a threat - they can execute all the techniques better than I can, and they know more, but they can't string it all together for as long - they lose the plot after a few techniques, while I can keep planning and acting while they lose their concentration, so as long as I can hold off their initial attacks, I'm pretty sure I'll score. That's why there are age groups in tournaments. Now, depending on the skill of the chronos cultist - which may not actually be nearly as high as Alice's as he would have been relying on precognition to deal with similar ranked or lower ranked opponents, thus actually reducing his chance for independent learning - it may not actually matter that the cultist has precognition. The first likely option that I can see if Alice is indeed capable of defeating the cultist hand-to-hand is that the cultist runs away or surrenders immediately, having been told by the AI that he can't win, precognition or not. The second option is that the fight will take longer than six seconds. One of the exercises we practice involves fighting six to ten other fighters one after the other, ten seconds for each other opponent. During those ten seconds, there may be a lot of hits scored, or none at all, however fighting non-stop for that time can get pretty exhausting. In a fight between high-dan martial artists (or those who can act as if they were), there may be quite some time of exchanging ineffective and only mildly effective blows before the telling blow is scored. Unlike in tournament fighting, real fighting is not to the first touch. An opponent may score a hit that was mostly deflected. Also, there are rarely any breaks while the judges call out the scores. So, our two martial artists might be fighting for some time. In my dojo, black belt (0-dan) students must fight for ten minutes non-stop in grading. Can the Chronos cultist match that kind of endurance? It is unlikely, given that he'd probably win most fights in the first 6 seconds. He would probably have trained, but he would be training for strength, to get his blows out faster, rather than for the endurance to outlast an opponent, given that he'd be used to winning quickly, and any injuries he might take would be from faster opponents. So, the fight between Alice and the cultist (assuming it happens at all) would go like this: The pair square off and begin circling one-another. The AI tells the cultist that this fight won't be won quickly, but the highest order of probability to inflict impairing damage on Alice is to do X, Y, Z and so on, which the cultist dutifully does, immediately going on the offensive. Alice may or may not actually take any hits, but they'll probably be minor if she does at this stage, and she may score some similarly minor hits of her own. This rapid exchange of blows would continue for some time, potentially up to a minute, and all the while both fighters will be getting tired. At some point, Alice may realise that the cultist is predicting her moves before she makes them, and from that point onward, she would fight more conservatively and defensively, always keeping her defensive options open, so while the cultist may be told the best sequence of actions, they won't necessarily be good enough against the better martial artist However, Alice, having better training, would have longer endurance, and the gap between the cultist and Alice will gradually widen. Alice will begin scoring more and potentially better hits as exhaustion begins to slow the cultist more than it slows her. As Alice observes the cultist slowing due to exhaustion, she can begin going back on the offensive. There is a difference between knowing what an opponent will do, and having the ability to counter that opponent, and despite attempting all the correct counters, the cultist will take more and more minor and less-than-minor hits. Then, the AI will realise that in six seconds the fight will be over, with the cultist as the loser, and there is no way out of this situation, as the AI/Cultist lost almost a minute ago, as the cultist's level of exhaustion passed the point where victory or escape was impossible, however the ultimate conclusion took more than 6 seconds to foresee. As the AI has foreseen, Alice delivers the final, telling sequence of attacks that fells the cultist. 

In the case of option 1, this could be an experiment on the effects of an anthropically-oriented universe as opposed to our impersonal universe. In the case of option 2, the creators of the luck transference technology/magic must either had the mistaken assumption that luck is a universally-limited resource rather than mere localised quantum variations that could be influenced without affecting other localities, or they must have - with malice aforethought - set out to ensure that the device they created had no net subjective benefit or harm to the beings in its area of influence. The reason for this may be simple malice, or there may be a more subtle, probably legally-oriented reason. For example: the government in the time and place that the device(s) was(were) created may have had some arcane legal requirement that equated imposition of health benefits with financial gain, and that in order to avoid that government's tax laws that would have seen the device's owners taxed according to the net benefit it bestowed, chose to have it impose no net benefit, by causing low-level harm to a large number of non-targets commensurate with the benefit gained by the low numbers of target individuals. As to how it works - that depends on the two cases above. In Case 1, the simulation/different universe: The luckiness or unluckiness of an individual is determined by the generation of a random number in the simulation engine. Luck transference to an individual or group may occur by having a subroutine pick better values out of a buffer of truly random data that is otherwise streamed sequentially as randomness is required, leaving the less-lucky values for everyone else. In Case 2, our own universe or a reasonable facsimile: The world may be seeded with nanites that are able to change living beings and influence otherwise random outcomes for better or worse relative to the living beings between them. Due to the requirement that the entire system confer no net gain or loss as subjectively assessed by those living beings, they would be networked, forming a distributed intelligence, reading peoples' minds and imposing 'luckiness' or 'unluckiness' according to their/its target criteria, the entire system designed to produce no net gain or loss except over short, non-reportable periods. How? The nanites might read an individual's intent, and assess the likelihood that the actions they were performing would lead to a subjectively positive or negative outcome, and if necessary alter those actions by something as simple as adding or subtracting a few nerve impulses here and there so that an individual's actions were unexpectedly successful or otherwise, or someone had (or didn't have) a particular worthwhile thought or idea, or they might correct or create a genetic or immunological deficiency that would lead to cancer or disease immunity. Either way, luck transference can probably be put down to someone quite a while ago making the informed decision to make a lot of people's lives more miserable than necessary.
