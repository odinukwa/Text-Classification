I have recently come into possession of a Coventry Eagle that I want to turn into a single speed bike. The Coventry Eagle has a three speed internal Sturmey Archer hub gear, obviously on a single speed this isn't wanted or needed. Being a frugal sort is it possible to remove a hub gear and keep the existing wheel? Or should I just get a new rear wheel? I know I can just set it in the gear I want it to be in and leave it at that but the hub gear adds considerable weight to the back of the bike, and also ruins the look I am going for. I carry out almost all of the maintenance on my bike and fit new components as and when needed. I can and will learn new skills if needed. This is a project bike intended to pass time and be a bit of fun, so keeping costs low is slightly more important than the time taken. However if it gets to a point where I am getting nowhere with something and it stops being fun I will seek professional help / buy something more suited to the job. 

In Russia, there is a special sport discipline "bike sport tourism" that includes travelling in urbanless areas for couple of days, without any possubility of communicating with anyone else except your group. In this case, we wear special rack bags up to 120 liters, but mostly around 90 liters for 3+ days or 45 liters for weekend-tourism mode. See PIK99 site, this is an example of how it is done. Note that it is very different to travel with about 25 additional kilagramms at your rear wheel, so be careful for the first time until you feel your bike with new weight mode. So for the offroad travels, I recommend putting something like I described before. For the asphalt-only, I would recommend putting bags on your front wheel mount or on a fork's legs 

I am doing a solo, unsupported 2 day charity ride, covering 260 miles in total. I am not taking any panniers or backpack, the only things im taking will fit in my saddlebag and my jersey pockets. The ride isn't an even split with the first day a mammoth (to me) 170 miles, though relatively flat ~1,700m climbing. I have ridden 100 miles many times and have fueled myself sufficiently through pre ride eating and gels, snacks and drinks on the ride. I am also not worried about the post ride nutrition as have done this many times as well. The thing I am unsure on is this: 170 miles is just under 70 miles further than I have ever ridden in one go. I know I can go just over 100 miles in about 6 hours without any issues on gels and snacks. I have a brand that I know doesn't cause me any stomach upset eating ~ 3 gels an hour for this time period. I am estimating 170 miles will take me somewhere between 10 and 12 hours to complete. Would I be stupid to try to complete this on gels & snacks alone? bearing in mind I'd have to carry somewhere close to 30 gels etc. Should I try to find a place to stop and eat a proper meal? and if so what type of things should I try to eat? I would assume carbs, rice or pasta but not too much, would any protein be good too? Fat & bread that sit on the stomach would be a big no no I assume. I was thinking about 90 miles into the first day so after about 6 hours, this puts me just over half way through the day and the area im looking at is on a big stretch between castles (im visiting 32 castles as the basis for the charity challenge) 

I have ridden thousands of miles on the original Shimano sealed square taper units, road and MTB, and never had one fail. Early FSA external bearing crank, garbage; same with the Enduro ceramic scam, so poorly made the bearing was not able to spin freely just from press fitting into the external cup, using their cup and their tool. Shimano Ultegra was an instant improvement, works after several years and am going to try the newest sealed upgrade - at $25-35, there is zero justification to waste $$$$$ on any other brand. If you get worried, you can pry out the bearing seal, clean and re-lube with good grease and go again. MT800 is the sealed mountain bike version as well. One caveat, is that all of these require the frame actually have a proper facing tool run before installing, as external cups are awfully sensitive to the outside BB faces being parallel. The old integrated square taper units were not, as they contained both bearings in a single sealed can that threaded into just one side of the bottom bracket. If you are dealing with any newer pressfit type, good luck. 

The charging port on my Garmin Touring has become wobbly and will no longer charge. It is about 3 years old. Looking around on line it appears the solder may have weakened and the charging port has disconnected from the circuit board. What I haven't been able to find is if this is a repairable issue, either at home, via Garmin or somewhere else. Does anyone know if this is possible to repair or do I need to start saving for a new one? 

As a side note: I want the bike to have a similar riding position as my road bike, so I will most likely have drop bars on it. If 700cc tires would make this easier to achieve then the removing of the hub gear becomes a mute point. 

When the first words used are "I personally don't think" I would tend to take the subsequent advice with extreme caution. There are well-established criteria for safety glasses that opinions do not circumvent, which many brands like Oakley meet or exceed in their entire lines of sports eyewear; they also have separate lines for ballistic protection, which meets much higher impact velocity standards for military/shooting protection. ANSI Z87.1 should be the minimum for safety, as both shatter resistance and impact penetration from things like rocks kicked by passing cars can go right through the wrong plastics, and no type of glass is safe. Falling can also shatter bad eyewear, and long shards of glass or plastic can blind you - an extremely poor tradeoff in cost and fashion vanity. Those tests on YouTube are the real deal, and you can't judge just by looking at a pair whether they will protect or not. As an aside, I'm doubting the worth of this stackexchange experiment, as too much of the advice seems to come not from those with insider knowledge, but from people just spouting opinions free from even personal anecdotal experience half the time. Honestly, when it comes to technical advice, some opinions are worth a lot more than others, and having to read through the uninformed when life or health is at stake, and try to differentiate good from bad makes for a very inefficient forum paradigm. 

Using headphones with bone conduction. I was using headphones with bone conduction while riding. You can hear clearly outside world and the music both. Your brain will automatically select the loudest sound from both two sources. Their problem that in a road with high car traffic there is an engine sounds that are louder then headphones, so, you dont listen to the music actually. After a year, i switched from headphones with bone conductuin to external speaker (one of JBL) and placed it on an internal frame traingle. After some time I changed it place to a side pocket of my backpack. In both places I had to make it macimum loud to hear. So I am now sure that sound system music source must be in front of you, as near as possuble to the ear to make it loud enough to hear and quite enough to othera not hear (wind blows off the sound whule you riding, so it is hard for sound to ger from a bottom of a frame to your ear while you moving). Next will be a little speaker placed on a handlebar so the sound will have mych shorter way to get to my ear, and i can make it mych quieter so other world wil not be annoyed by my music and i will not have to make it's sound volume too high to hear, and that will save batteries) 

A late addition, but from decades of owning Campy and Shimano, each should last forever with basic cleaning and lubing. Seventeen year old Dura-ace rear has zero play. By contrast, I've worn out SRAM MTB X7 and X9 rears in one to two years, despite frequent TLC. Their weakness is mostly in the soft metal of the parallelogram bushing pivots, with tiny plastic inserts which get loose no matter what lube you can get into them, and soft alloy main pivot bolt which screws into the hanger. Pulley wheels get all the attention, but you can run them forever if clean, and they are cheap to replace, whereas the main derailleur parts are not at all.
