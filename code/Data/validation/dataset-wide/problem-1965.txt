Why would the manager be interested in passing on more work, or sole responsibility for work, to someone who is noticeably absent from work? The redundancy might be because the manager is not confident that the person who is away more often will get it done, and it might be an interim step towards eventually cutting ties with that worker. If you want or need more challenges, certainly express your willingness to your manager, but stay away from the topic of how he/she distributes work. There may be a reason for it, and, really, it will come across as you trying to manage your manager, and questioning how they do their job.... especially if you've already brought up the topic of the duplication. 

You've already communicated to your boss that you aren't comfortable with this person. She's already going around you and has established a relationship with others she is working with for being difficult. Seems to me that you've already done what you need to in planting the seed that she might not be the best person make part of the team. Your company has to deal with her now because she works for a customer, but if she's difficult, probably no one is going to say "wow, she needs to be difficult, here, for us all the time and make that impression upon others as part of our team." The company would consider such a move if, in her dealing with your company, people are highly impressed and like working with her. If someone were floating the idea, generally, and didn't know much about her, they'd ask the people she does deal with regularly how she is. Seems to me, that (A) you're really not in a position to personally stop this, (B) you've already done what you can while still staying professional, and (C) there's no way others are going to be clamoring to bring her on board, in fact, if she has a reputation for being difficult, the opposite recommendation will probably be offered. Hopefully your company doesn't have a penchant for shooting itself in the foot. I'd guess you should be fine, other than getting passive-aggressively harassed by proxy by having every recruiter in the world bothering you. 

I'm not aware of anyone who asks, in an interview "Hey, wouldn't you like to work a similar position to ours with the company that laid you off?" First of all, they want you for their position. Secondly, a company that lays someone off is, to the person laid off, a company with a track record of employment insecurity, so I don't think they'd assume you'd favor that. I can't envision a scenario where that would be brought up by an interviewing company. If you were currently employed at the previous company, they might ask why you want to leave that company (to assess your motivations and priorities, not to suggest that you stay - and the answer often is "I don't want to leave, necessarily, but your company/opportunity is attractive enough for me to consider it."), or why you left your previous job (if no longer employed there), or why you want to work for them (will almost always ask). But "Hey, why don't you want to work this kind of position with another specific company?" Good workers are hard enough for companies to find, without them steering potential candidates to other opportunities or suggesting alternatives to their position that a candidate might not have considered. If I were wooing a potential dating partner, I'd never suggest to them that they could go on a similar date with a former flame, know what I mean? It's simply not going to happen. But if it does, "I was already laid off at the company because of general instability there. I'm looking for an opportunity and a company on more solid ground." 

It certainly can be, though if you are screened out in the very initial processes, you might have a difficult time getting anyone to respond to your queries. Heck, sometimes it is impossible to get feedback even if you are a finalist. Companies are very gun-shy about telling people why the did not get selected because they feel it would be like giving someone ammunition for a potential lawsuit. Even if they prevail, it's a nuisance to defend against some kind unfair treatment legal claim, so they instead will try to avoid saying anything. It's not considered rude or out of place, though, so long as, when you ask, you ask in the spirit of trying to understand to make improvements for other opportunities in your job search, and not to argue with them about why they were wrong to do so. Don't be surprised if, if they actually do respond, the only response you get is "you were an excellent candidate, but we felt another candidate was a better fit for the position." 

It wouldn't hurt or be unprofessional to ask, framed with the historical context that you've given. Having said that, if they didn't give anyone a heads up last time, don't be surprised if you get some kind of non-answer mumbo-jumbo, or, when the boss says "No, you have nothing to worry about" they drop the hammer on you anyway. The problem is that, until they drop you, they need you to do certain work. If the position is going to be downsized and you are proactive and leave just ahead of that, then they are in the very difficult position of having to backfill for a very short period of time - either expensive temporary/contract rates, or distributing your work to others who probably have pretty full plates. Certainly hiring a new employee for such a short timeframe is not feasible. The best situation for the company is to keep you working right up until the moment they don't need your labor, but not a minute before or, more relevantly to you, past that. So, you can ask, but I wouldn't put any weight into the belief that you're being told the truth, necessarily. You're not reading too much into it. You've seen this pattern before, you've assessed your own work volume and uniqueness of the position, and they've been asking probing questions that impact the future of that position. Start searching, as if you've been told your job is in jeopardy and there's a strong chance it will be eliminated. Since you should proceed in that manner, regardless, there's really no reason to ask to confirm your suspicions. You are much, much more employable if you are still currently employed, vs. being between positions. 

This is a no-win situation for you. Ultimately, professionally, your primary responsibility is to your own professional career. If it turns out badly for those still with the company, that's because of company management decisions. You did all you could to try and alter that outcome. You don't owe any more. If you do stay, it will probably be miserable with a bad outcome, to boot, by your own reflection on the topic. If you stay and somehow manage to save the project and the entire company, then, in all likelihood, you are being seriously underpaid, and deserve equity and greater strategic responsibility, which you would probably have to leave to get, if they are unwilling to listen to your input now. Best of luck. Obviously, my opinion is that you should start looking ASAP. I don't think anyone would fault you for leaving a situation like that. 

It's rather coarsely and judgmentally phrased, but responding to it with your situation does not necessarily mean that you are validating those judgments or perspectives. I think the intent was to find if there was a situation they were unaware of, like Asperger's or some formal social anxiety diagnosis. So - "There's nothing wrong, specifically. I'm just very shy and introverted and am uncomfortable with small talk. It's also nothing personal against anyone. I appreciate you asking, though." I don't think there's anything obtrusive about making the inquiry, ham-handed as it was, if they phrased it like that. Nothing wrong or oppressive to you about you responding, either. If they offer to try and make it easier for you, and you are interested, that's all good. If they try to browbeat you into interacting in a way that is not comfortable for you, then that is a problem. We're starting to stray into the realm of workplace bullying in that situation, though I'd avoid using those words to them, because that escalates any sort of confrontational tone there might be. Ask them politely to stop. If they don't, then bring your manager or HR in, making sure to emphasize that continued brow-beating in the future may make you feel like you are in a hostile work environment. Those words will usually trigger a request from above for co-workers to back off, since social interaction on their terms is not important enough to the work production to risk a legal mess. 

I've always been a lone, full-stack developer for small organizations, so my opinion probably counts for less since there is no collaborative code review process when it's just me. However, wouldn't another approach be - 

Do you have experiences from Team "B" that are valuable to you and make you more qualified to do your job with Team "A"? If so, then you need to share that with them somehow, and an interview would be appropriate. Is only it your experiences with Team "A", before, that garnered you impeccable exit evaluations/interviews, that will determine whether you get this role? If so, then don't. The hiring manager said, specifically, that they are well aware of your body of work, first hand, and that it is not necessary unless you want to. Sounds like all things being equal, you don't really want to, but you worry that all things are not equal. If the hiring manager, being the main person who determines who they will hire, felt that not interviewing would put you at any sort of a disadvantage, he would not have told you, in no uncertain terms, that it is not necessary. You worry, it seems, that the outside candidates will seem "fresh" in their impressions and that you might lose out. If that's your worry, I'd decline the interview, but state that you are perfectly willing to participate for one if any of the team members feels like they want a fresh interview impression to help them compare apples to apples. Otherwise, if they tell you it's specifically not necessary, you request one, and have nothing new to add to what they already know about you, then you run the risk of basically wasting their time. That would possibly make a worse impression than that which already existed.
