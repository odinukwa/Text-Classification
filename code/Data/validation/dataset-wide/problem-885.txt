The graph shows how temperature and energy drop as the universe expands in the first seconds after the BB. Note that at 1000 seconds (about 20 minutes) the energy is too low to create electrons (0.5 MeV), let alone heavier elements. What is created in the expansion, though, is dark energy. Its density is constant, so when the universe expands to double its size the amount of dark energy will also be doubled. (That's the reason why the expansion goes ever faster and faster, with nothing to stop it.) 

4 billion years is the same timeframe of the life remaining to our Sun. So if we have not yet invented interstellar voyages, we're screwed, with or without Andromeda. Besides, stars do not interact directly with each other in a galactic collision. What we will notice from the several stars we are on is that star orbits around the galactic centre will be altered by the massive gravitational perturbation made by the other galaxy. Almost all stars will change orbits from that of orbiting around the galactic centre to orbiting around the center of mass of both galaxies. Some stars will be ejected out of the new bigger galaxy. It is quite safe to think that planets will continue orbiting their stars, but not that they will not have some alterations in their orbits. On the other hand, from the gas to gas interaction, there will be a lot of new pressure waves in the interstellar medium, which will account for the formation of billions of new stars in new nebulae. 

"before" is not the right word. It suggests that there was an arrow of time which allowed to trace events. But time was created only with the big bang, there was no before. We don't know where the matter came from, or what caused the Big Bang. One hypothesis suggests that it was caused by the collision of branes in other universes, but there's no way to verify this, so in a strict sense it isn't science. Many researchers think we'll never have an answer this. 

There are plenty of sky simulators where you can calculate that information yourself. e.g. Celestia, KStars Just install one of them and it will tell you position in sky and distance to most known bodies in Solar System, for any given time. 

The Sun burns hidrogen, so it is a star. Jupiter does not, so it is not a star. Not even a brown dwarf. Since a non-star body orbits a star, it is a planet, a dwarf planet or an asteroid/comet. Since Jupiter has cleared his orbit, it is a planet. Why do I say that Jupiter orbits a star? This is where I go to the center of your question. The orbit of the Sun around the galactic center is (more or less) a circle. If you draw Jupiter's orbit around the galactic center it has some retrogradations and is not always convex. 

Yes. The tidal locking of the moon with respect to the earth means that the moon rotates once and it axis in exactly the same time it requires to orbit the earth. To always see the same side of earth you have to orbit it in the same time as the earth needs to rotate about its axis, i.e. in 24 hours. The moon orbit around the earth takes about 27 days, so from the moon you'll see the earth rotate below you, and in time you get to see all sides of it. The orbit period is dictated by the distance from the earth; objects farther from the earth will orbit it more slowly, objects closer by more rapidly. In order to always see the the same side of earth an object needs to be at a particular place, a geostationary orbit, which is in the equatorial plane. This is at 42000 km from the center of the earth, or about 36000 km above its surface. Television and other communication satellites are in a geostationary orbit, and this orbit is so crowded that satellites sit at just a few tens of kilometers from their neighbors. Everybody wants her satellite at the right longitude to service North America or Europe. Kepler's 3rd Law says that there's a fixed relationship between the orbital period squared and the distance cubed. For instance the moon's period in days squared is about 750. If you divide the moon's distance cubed by the geostationary orbit's distance cubed you get this same number. 

Right Ascension is a celestial coordinate, not a terrestrial one. RA is used to locate a star on sky, and is measured between a fixed point in the sky (the crossing of the Ecliptic and the Celestial Equator) and the star's meridian. It corresponds to terrestrial coordinate Latitude. Thus, Greenwich has no Right Ascension. 

Yes, it can be used, but it is not easy. For the latitude, you usually need to know the Alt of Polaris. You can derive that if you know the Alt of two of the three, but the (spherical geometry) formulas for that are not simple. For the longitude, you need Greenwich time and the RA of any star. Any star includes Vega, Altair and Deneb ;) 

edit Enter relativity. So we say the light from Proxima Centauri has been underway for 4.2 years, but only from our point of view. As objects go nearer the speed of light their time slows down, and ultimately when you would reach light speed time would stop completely. Now photons travel at the speed of light, so for them time is at a standstill. From the photon's point of view it travels the whole distance from Proxima Centauri to Earth instantaneously: it arrives at Earth at the same time it leaves Proxima Centauri! (You can't do this with objects which have mass.) 

Time, as we know it, started with Big Bang, so there is no "before". And if there is "another" Big Bang (which I doubt as the universe is likely to expand forever) it will not be "another" Big Bang, but "the" Big Bang, as time will start anew with it. 

No, it is not just a matter of migration. You need to take into account two facts. One is that (as experience shows) Io's own gravity is enough to avoid it breaking by tidal forces. It has been like that through all its history: Io could not have been formed if it started aggregating today, but it was formed at the same time Europa and Ganymede did: they three were growing in parallel. Other is that of the orbital resonances, which makes precisely that orbit with so simple integer number relations with those of Europa and Ganymede a stable one. Io could not have been formed in another place. 

All light we see is from the past. The light from a light bulb at 3 meter distance arrives 10 ns after it left the bulb in your eye. For short distances this delay is negligible (10 ns is 10 billionths of a second), but at astronomical scale it becomes significant. Light from the Sun takes 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach the Earth, so when we see the Sun it's the Sun like it was 8 minutes ago. If the Sun would suddenly die we wouldn't notice for 8 minutes. The same goes for other stars in our Galaxy. The light from a star at 4 light years takes 4 years to reach us; it's the definition of a light year. One could make the following comparison: suppose there's a town at 100 car years from where you live. That means it takes a car 100 years to reach you. When a car from that town reaches you today it left in 1914. It won't be a 2010 sedan, but a Ford T. As the car arrives you're looking 100 years in the past. This looking into history is very convenient for cosmologists. You want to know what galaxies looked like 13.5 billion years ago, when the Universe was still young? Well, look for light that's been underway for that time. It left the galaxy under study 13.5 billion years ago and shows you what that galaxy looked like at the time. It doesn't tell you anything about the current state of it. It may have collided with another galaxy or absorbed by a black hole. There's no way of knowing other than waiting another 13.5 billion years, until the light emitted now will reach us. Another interesting thing to observe from that far past is the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB). It's the radiation from the Big Bang, which has been underway for 13.8 billion years. Of course today the Big Bang is history, but thanks to the "limited" light speed this history is continuously underway to us. 

In order to know when a star will be above horizon, you'll need an equation with times, not "celestial latitudes". So you end up adding RA and sidereal time. EDIT In order to find out the position of a star you need to find out how its Hour Angle varies with time. The Hour Angle is how far the star is from the observer's meridian: Diagram of angles $URL$ In this image, it is the angle between the site's celestial meridian (North Celestial P ole-Z enith-S outh horizon) and the star's celestial meridian (P-X-Y). It is the same angle as between where X culminates and X. So it comes than $HA=ST-RA$ and since you may not have a "local sidereal time" clock at hand, you can use Greenwich's Sidereal Time: $HA=GST-Lat-RA$ 

A note: don't talk about inflation for the current expansion. Inflation is the brief period immediately after the BB when the universe expanded at an outlandish rate. Matter was formed when the universe was so compact that its temperature was billions and even trillions of Kelvin hot. The energy of the vacuum in any given volume was so high that matter-antimatter pairs were created, which usually quickly annihilated. Sometimes, however those short-lived particles collided, releasing large amounts of energy. For instance, to create an electron you need an energy of 0.5 MeV. The graph below shows that at a temperature of $10^{16}$ K collision energy could be as high as 1 TeV. Because of its expansion the universe has cooled so much that its temperature is less than 3 K, which isn't nearly enough to create any new particles.
