To eliminate the disjunction, prove your conclusion (here P) for each terms of the disjunction in sub proofs. If the conclusion holds for each terms separately, then it holds for the disjunction of them too. Alternatively, you can prove P by drawing a contradiction from not-P (then again you'll have to show that each term of the disjunction entails a contradiction, given not-P). 

First, B theory is a semantic theory about the proper way to refer to events in time, not a metaphysical theory about past and future events. The view that past and future events are real is called eternalism. It's true that B theory fits better with eternalism than with other metaphysical theories of time, but strictly speaking they are distinct. Second, eternalism and determinism are also distinct views. Determinism is the view that the future is determined by the past and by the laws of nature, but it is conceivable that future facts are real although they are not determined by laws (for example: the exact same state A evolves into either B or C at different places or times so determinism is false). Regarding compatibility with libertarian free will, the crucial aspect is necessity. Libertarian free will is sometimes expressed as follows: an agent could have done otherwise, which, roughly, means that what the agent did was not necessary. Libertarian free will is incompatible with determinism because if everything happens in virtue of the laws of nature, and if the laws of nature express relations of necessity in the world, then it is not true that an agent could have done otherwise. However libertarian free will is not strictly incompatible with eternalism. Saying that future events are real does not mean that they will happen in virtue of necessity so there is room for a combination of libertarian free will and eternalism. Having said that, this is quite a formal reasoning and our intuitions speak differently. Most defenders of libertarian free will would probably say that it requires that the future is open, i.e. that future events are not (yet) settled for us to have any choice. This intuition can be cast in terms of necessity: one could argue that something that is the case is necessarily the case, so that if every fact is settled in eternity, then everything true (including about future facts) is also necessary, and that therefore eternalism is incompatible with libertarian free will. 

All you can say is that man is part of something perfect, not that man is perfect. You need another premiss which can be challenged: the parts of something perfect are also perfect. 

There's no contradiction in this view, but you need an account of "approximate truth" for it to work, because you want to say that our current theories might be false, but are still truer than past theories. So theoretical truth cannot be a yes-or-no concept. As other commentators noted, this hinges on what conception of truth you adopt, and incidentally what conception of meaning you adopt (i.e. how you interpret the content of theories). What is almost certain is that current theories are more empirically successful than past ones, so if you think truth is only a matter of empirical success (following a pragmatic conception of truth, and an empirically based interpretation of theories) then you will have progress. But many philosophers are dissatisfied by such account of truth: they think truth transcends our possibilities of empirical verification, that it is correspondence to the world. There could be ways to accommodate a notion of approximate truth within a correspondence theory of truth, though. Two aspects of theories must be taken into account: the structural aspects (equations, models) and the referential aspects (the linguistic meaning of physical properties, the fact that they correspond to natural kinds). It's probably more easy to have approximate truth for structural aspect: there could be mathematical resemblance relations. The structure of theories would more and more resemble the structure of the world. The case of reference is more problematic. Is it "approximately true" that there are gravitational forces in the universe, now that we talk about curvature of space time instead? Or is it plain false? Saying that talk of newtonian forces is really disguised talk of space time curvatures seems a bit far fetched and one could be tempted to say that there really are no Newtonian forces in the world... Now perhaps our theories are more and more true because more and more terms actually refer to natural kinds and properties. Or perhaps theoretical properties can be more or less good carvings of the structure of the world, and current properties are better than previous ones in this respect. Another solution is to adopt structural realism: there's convergence toward truth, but it only concerns the structure of theories, not the fact that the types of objects and properties that posit really exist independently in the world. The problem of this solution is that it's not obvious that it doesn't boil down to empirical success only. A structure must be structure of something, and if its not structure of natural kinds, it must be structure of observational regularities, but then, saying that the structure of theories reassemble the structure of the world is just saying that our theories are empirically successful. 

Contemporary physicists cannot calculate the structure of complex molecules (up to a few atoms), even with huge computational capacities: they ask chemists to do this. In sum, the conjecture today is that ultimate physics will be computable and it's an unlikely conjecture. Actual physics is not computable for many foundational reasons. You could argue that it's not necessary to have all physical information: the substrate does not matter, only the "software" (the higher level) matters... But this is question begging. Why wouldn't the substrate matter for consciousness? Only when strong AI will be a success we'd know that it's the case. 

According to Wittgenstein, the role of philosophy is to clarify meaning until statements are either scientifically tractable, or meaningless (i.e. pseudo questions). The "disputable sphere of natural science" coincide with meaningful questions. Wittgenstein was not really concerned by the demarcation between science and pseudo-science, but this verificationist principle was adapted by Popper into a falsificationist principle for that purpose (although Popper did not think that non-scientific statements are meaningless). This is clearly a demarcation between science and metaphysics, and a rejection of metaphysics as meaningless. Entity realism is a realism, and realism is a metaphysical position. Entity realism is thus metaphysics and meaningless, by verificationist standards. I don't think the tractatus is so concerned about dogmatism or foundationalism. You can be dogmatic about verifiable statements you do not wish to verify, and in any case it seems that verificationism requires some sort of foundationalism (empiric verification as a foundation of knowledge). The main focus of the tractatus is not on knowledge, but on meaning and truth. Wittgenstein would probably reject the question of knowledge as untractable: you cannot question the possibility of knowledge, because you cannot possibly "see" your own relation to the world, it is just given. 

Space and time are distinct concepts. The fact that relativity makes of time the fourth dimension doesn't mean that space and time are not treated distinctly, as you observe yourself. The metric of relativity makes it clear that one dimension receives a special treatment, in any referential. This is what the concept of time, as opposed to space, subsumes, and the concept remains open to inquiry. You say that space and time don't exist because of different referentials, but one should not confuse the topology, the metric and a coordinate system. Different referentials assign different space-time coordinates to events. But coordinates are not space or time, they are tools for making calculations. The lesson we should draw from this fact about the concepts of space and time is, again, open to inquiry. Something is absolute and doesn't depend on the referential: the clock hypothesis, which says that a clock measures the (frame independent) space-time interval along its path. That looks pretty much like an absolute notion of time (since obviously, clock are not meant to measure distances). Arguably this is what the concept of time refers to in relativity. Even conflating time and the measure of time in a specific referential, the lesson you draw, that space and time are relative to a subject, might be a possible lesson but note that "subject" is not the same as "referential" nor "observer" in the sense of physicists (which really means referential anyway), so you'd have to argue a little more to convince that space and time are not "real". It's really unfortunate that physicists use the term " observer" because it brings confusion: any human observer (=subject) is free to use any coordinate system she wishes to describe the world. In any case it's certainly not the only lesson to draw. After all, there is also cosmological time, and perhaps there is a priviledged frame of reference, that of the CMB. If quantum mechanics is non-local, maybe that means something for time too, we don't know yet. Furthermore (to rejoin other answers) the metaphysical questions on space and time are rarely about its existence, rather about its status: is space-time only relations between objects or events, or something more substantive (would it exist without any objects)? Can we account for the passage of time in a block universe, or is change an illusion, to be reframed in terms of different states at different locations in time? What does it imply for our understanding of causation, and the fact that most scientific explanations are causal and time-directed? Is the past hypothesis / entropy account enough to account for all kinds of scientific explanations, even when thermodynamics isn't obviously related? Or is there an intrinsic direction of time associated with "evolution" laws? Or are we merely recording regularities on the distribution of events in a block universe? All these are meaningful questions which connects science with a broader, big picture of the world, and opinions and intuitions diverge strongly on these topics, even among scientists themselves, so science doesn't have the last word on this. It's a matter of interpreting what science tells us. That's why we are arguing. 

None of the above. It's E: it's rational to act only in one's own interest, and it's irrational to act only in the interest of others. Since rational is not exactly equivalent to what you ought to do, this is distinct from B (but it could imply B). 

The position that "the world is wholly governed by a consistent set of physical laws" is just physicalism, if by "wholly" you mean that there are no other laws (or they supervene on physical laws) and nothing is excluded from them. This is quite explicit when you say that this should "leave no room for dualism". Physicalism is a monism. You object that physicalism does not touch on causality, but your own position only touches on causality if you add a specific interpretation of laws of nature (for example that laws are not mere regularity recording). Implicit in the term "physical" is that what is physical follows the laws of physics, and nothing else. An expression more explicitely focused on causality is physical closure or causal closure of the physical. It expresses the idea that physical effects have complete, sufficient physical causes. See $URL$ . Depending on your acceptance of higher-level non-reducible (non-physical) natural laws, you might opt for the weaker position of naturalism. (There are brands of non-reductive physicalisms but there consistence and/or relevance is a contentious issue.) The term is notoriously more vague, generic and difficult to define, but it opposes the supernatural more frontally. Some authors distinguish "methodological" and "metaphysical" naturalism and equate the former with scientific method. Perhaps this is what you were after, but then you should talk of "natural laws" instead of "physical laws". Also note that there is a tension between leaving room for non-reductionism and the desirata that "no room is left for dualism". 

Noone is arguing that everyone guilty of any crime should be killed. Arguing that death penalty is sometimes appropriate is arguing in favour of death penalty, while arguing that it never is is arguing against it. Per my understanding, your solution implies that death penalty is sometimes appropriate, but that we should avoid it whenever possible. I suppose many defenders of death penalty would agree with you. Regarding the "formal, objective" aspect of your question: I don't think ethical questions can take an objective form (such as a valued field on the space of possible situations), at least not in our current state of knowledge. First you'd need a "space of possible situations" (in what language? The language of physics? Lots of complications here) and even then according to some ethical theories it would still be difficult or impossible (for example, if value judgments are contextual or requires a "moral sense"). 

Methodological naturalism (MN) is the view that naturalism is a working method of science. Science will attempt to find natural explanations to all phenomena it studies. That doesn't necessarily mean that the supernatural doesn't exist (which would be metaphysical naturalism), since science is not necessarily complete. As far as I understand the citation, provisional and intrinsic are two variants of MN (they're not metaphysical naturalism). According to provisional MN, naturalism is a working method of science, but that could well change in the future. It's just that no supernatural explanations are needed so far, and MN works very well until now. The method is used in science because it works, just as theories are used because they work. However if some kind of phenomena happened to find no natural explanation then science could change its method and revise MN. It would still be science. According to intrinsic MN, naturalism is an essential component of the scientific method. If we revoke MN, then we're not doing science anymore. If some kind of phenomena finds no natural explanation, then it finds no scientific explanation: that would show that science has its limits. This boils down to a debate over what defines science, and whether methodological naturalism is a core aspect of it, i.e. one of its defining characteristic, or merely a contingent one that happens to be succesful. 

This is the other way around: the thermodynamic arrow of time is sometimes invoked to explain why we have memories from the past and not from the future. The thermodynamic arrow of time rests on the idea that past sates are statistically implausible (this is the past hypothesis) and that implausible states have more chance to evolve into more plausible states. Now consider a footstep in the sand: this is a rather implausible state. Chances are that this state evolved from an even more implausible state in the past (someone walking on the sand). So traces are always traces of a more implausible state, i.e. traces from the past. The same would go for our memories, construed as traces from the past. It is controversial whether such explanation is circular or not. Some (e.g. Maudlin) argue that it already requires a notion of evolution, which will be directed from past to future, so the explanation already assumes an arrow of time. It is also controversial whether the applicability of the notion of entropy, which measures the implausibility of a state, can be extended to these cases which are not strictly speaking in the realm of thermodynamics. However some authors (e.g. Albert) argue that a past hypothesis is available in any case, even if it is not casted in terms of entropy. 

Imagine (2) is the case. You have persons capable of perceiving truth about reality, yet they don't accept that 2+2=4 even though they share our definitions of 2, + and 4. I think this statement is problematic. 2+2=4 follows from the definition as a matter of logic. If they don't reach the same conclusion, they must have different inference rules, a different logic. But the definitions of 2, + and 4 are logical definitions! How can they have the same definitions if they don't share our logic? We must conclude that these persons are not talking about the same 2, +, 4 as us. Now consider the following: there exist some persons, capable of perceiving truths about the world, but the very meaning of our numbers doesn't make sense to them, so they'll never reach the conclusion that 2+2=4. I think the statement is still problematic. If these persons share our logic, then our definition of numbers should be accessible to them. We could just give them the axioms. So these persons must have a different logic that is not translatable into our own. But how are we entitled to call it a logic if it is not even translatable into ours, or accessible to us? There is nothing "logical" in it. Anyway let us assume we have reasons to call it a different logic. Logic is about inferences that preserve truth. If these persons have different rules for truth preservation, then how are we entitled to call it truth? Isn't it a different concept from our concept of truth? Now if these persons don't share our concept of truth, why should we still call them persons? Remember a person (as you defined it) is an entity capable of entertaining truth about the world but it's not clear that "persons" with a completely different, untranslatable logic and notion of truth can be said to entertain truth about the world. It's not clear why we should say that they entertain truth rather than vgghjvf (replace with any string you like). Perhaps we couldn't even say that these "persons" have a language and communicate. Imagine they share signals and act accordingly. If we can see patterns in their behaviour, then probably we can start decoding their language, i.e. we have the begining of a translation, of a "logic". Now if you encounter objects on a planet with signals travelling between them but their behaviour appears completely random and inconsistent with the signals, you'd probably not say that they are intelligent creature: you'd view that as a mere random natural phenomenon, such as clouds in the sky or whatever. You wouldn't call these objects "persons". So it seems that if not even the begining of a form of communication is possible between us and them (and arguably that would require having a translatable logic for a start), then we'd have no good reasons to call them "persons", because after all, the way we define what a person is comes from our standards, and our logic is embedded into that standards.
