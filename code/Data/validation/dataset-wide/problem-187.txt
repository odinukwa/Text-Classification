This material has mor or less the same properties as iron and alloys are posible, so you can make a "steel" sword.(When alloying lets suppose d do not change) Now we have four different materials: The first one(A) has all iron/steel properties but d=0.5 The second(B) is 10 times dense so ten times mass and is of course has ten times toughness, hardness etc... (and yes It can be work in a forge because of the fairy thing)in this case d=0.05 The third(C) is the same 100 times everything d=0.005 The forth(D) ... d=0.0005 Time to swing that swords! But, what will happen? Test 1 

They need a to enter victim but they can consume bones, that may be because they have two different "stances", lets say migration and feeding so when they are in migration mode they have a normal solid shell-type body, but in contact a liquid they dissolve like a slime which is useful to enter in other organism via circulatory system and just dissolve/control-it but not so when you just spread away in water with huge solubility and nothing to feed of. 

The key here is that it "might" call for some human ingenuity. However, chances are that most of the time there will be no need for anything out of the ordinary and no human is even needed. In this case the human is just an additional precaution for a very expensive investment. However, sending more than 1 human for something that barely takes 1 makes very little sense. 

Having it written somewhere that you cannot see it, is going to provide significantly less mental focus and safety. This is probably only slightly less risky than just doing it all in your head. If you are worried about someone else interpreting your runes then use a cipher that is only meaningful to the caster. It doesn't even have to be a complex cipher. After all, how long does your opponent really have to figure it out before you are done casting? Or write your runes on 2 (or more) separate items that you only assemble at the moment you are going to cast. So there is no time for someone else to read and comprehend the whole thing. 

What modifications would be needed for a mammal, bird or reptile to work with electricity? For work I mean mostly think and move, for example it would need to eat in order to repair it's body, grow or reproduce... It's an animal made by genetic engineering. I'm interested in: 

Everybody wants to win the lottery: Suppose you are a god and each time there is an event in which luck or "god's favor" is involved you will get a ton of request to win and each of those is incompatible with the rest... Edit: Even if you are a god you just can't please everybody because there will be many times where helping someone implies prejudice others, for example in business what do you do when two companies are competing an both ask for divine help to overrun the other,both are good (insert cult name) so you just don't help or do you?. In the end anything you do or don't will annoy someone so the only options you have are: A:not more request rule. B:any request that may prejudice another of my followers will be unheard. 

The real problem is that the stone does not actually force you to speak truth. So when you speak a half-truth or a misleading truth it will still identify it as a lie. A clever person could still work their way through this by only saying things intended to mislead or deceive. The listener would still have to interpret which parts are a lie. For example, I and my accomplice commit a crime. The witness only saw me at the crime scene. I am asked if I committed the crime. The truth is that I and my buddy committed the crime. In order to protect my accomplice, I claim that "I" committed the crime. The stone shows I am misleading them. Everyone now believes that I did not commit the crime. They may wonder why I choose to lie about it but the more guilty I say I am, the more innocent the stone makes me look since I am intentionally misleading them. This is just one example. Deceive and manipulate with every statement you make. At worst you will muddy the waters and sow confusion. At best, if the questioning is not extremely careful, you can inversely prove your innocence in your attempts to mislead them when admitting the exact nature of your guilt. A few incidents like this and people will wonder if the stone really works or whether it is really some kind of political tool the king uses to make anyone he wants appear to be guilty of something so he can execute them. Edit: I just wanted to clear up some things brought up in the comments. First, the base assumptions are: 1) No one but the accused actually saw the exact moment the crime was committed. 2) The accused was seen at the scene of the crime (perhaps even doing something very suspicious) If there is other evidence then you really aren't making a conviction based on what the stone indicates. You are just using it to confirm. However, in this case you would probably be found guilty even without a magic stone. So I am not talking about that. Second, I am not suggesting that lies and deception can always get you off the hook. That is definitely at one end of a scale of different possibilities. If you tell a lot of lies, people might just assume you are guilty even if they aren't sure exactly what you are hiding. However, that won't help them find the loot, identify your accomplices, or force you to incriminate yourself on additional items they don't already know about (unless you are careless in your wording). They still can't actually force you to say specific words. You can keep these secrets all the way to the grave if you really want to. Third, considering there is only 1 king and 1 stone, how long do you really think he will spend interrogating someone for any single case? Assumptions that the prosecutor is hyper-competent and has all the time in the world are just as unlikely as the king asking a single question and then letting the accused go because that single answer was really slick. Fourth, there is no such thing as a question that can only be answered by yes or no. Even if a question can be answered with one word, doesn't mean it has to be. Some of the comments about this sort of thing actually reminded me of a scene from one of Steven Brust's novels. I don't have the exact quotes but let me summarize: The assassin/sorcerer/witch Vlad Taltos is brought before the empress to answer questions about a murder. The empress questions him with the imperial orb (basically just like our truth stone). When asked if he killed the man, he does not answer yes or no. Instead he says something like: I believe he chose to die. When they ask if he is saying that the man committed suicide, he basically says that suicide is an accurate description. Vlad did in fact assassinate the man. However, the orb shows that all his statements are true. This is because he genuinely believes that anyone who voluntarily chooses to pick a fight with an assassin/sorcerer/witch is definitely committing suicide...and who wouldn't agree with that? :-) 

The body is, by itself, a terrible conduit for magical energy. It's not that it can't conduct the energy; it just has a nasty habit of heating up and spontaneously combusting if you go too far. Naturally, a way around this would be to use a rod of some sort of magically conductive material (say, a wooden staff with a thin gold interior) to focus your energy and enhance your "I'm not exploding yet" threshold. Another work-around might be to have multiple people and divvy up the total energy between them or their staves. Think of magic like water pressure. The human body is very weak: even a little bit of pressure and it pops (sorry for that image). A rod of precious metals or gems (if that's what you want to use) can store and focus higher magical pressures without being structurally compromised. So a staff would provide both focus of energy (you are emitting the same amount of energy from a smaller aperture, so more like a knife than a skimpy punch) and storage of energy (more pressure, less exploding) for its user. (Also a staff of precious metals would be sheathed in something natural like wood. Carrying around a thick piece of metal in your bare hands would be torture in colder regions.) EDIT: Certain base materials could also have specialties in the sense that they can do one of these things more effectively: 

However, the situation sounds exactly the same as if you just said they aren't allowed to have firearms. If you are only allowed to have one as long as you don't get caught with it, that is functionally no different than not being allowed to have it at all. So the weapon that makes the most sense is none at all. You'd probably learn to use martial arts or common everyday items offensively, if you bother at all. The easiest way to eliminate rivals would be to plant weapons on them and then accuse them. 

This is pretty irrational. If you can lose your position for someone knowing you have a weapon, under what circumstance would you ever use the weapon? Any time you use the weapon it would become clear that you had one and you would lose everything. If you can never actually use it then why would you carry it? This situation is all risk and no benefit. You said: 

Anything functional at long range that can carry a line could actually be lethal. Is it really necessary to actually hit the person or just land it near enough that they can grab it? I wouldn't aim a crossbow at a friend, especially if I am going to have to heal them. If you want a non-lethal projectile think of something like a yo-yo or a blowgun. However, the range may be much shorter than you would like. However, one should consider whether a healer is really also likely to be a master marksman at long range. Also, if your healer is at an extreme distance from his allies doesn't that make him a prime target in many cases? A shorter range weapon may be appropriate since he would still be able to heal from cover or hiding. However, he would still need to be pretty close. 

See this question for what I'm talking about: Realism of this Respawning Creature How would these people view death and future events? They would probably have two or more words for it, one being impermanent and the other lasting and unchangeable. How would they talk about/refer to death and the passage of time? 

I'm a xenobiologist going on an expedition to a habitable planet about 14 LY away. We don't expect to find anything amazing - maybe some bacteria to study - but lo and behold, the place is teeming with all sorts of complex life. Looks like I'll be busy. How do I classify these creatures? Do I use the old naming conventions from Earth? They won't fit well, because most of them can't be strictly placed under "plant" or "animal" and they exhibit...well, alien behaviors. Should I just slap another term on (Origin, Kingdom, Phylum, etc.) to specify the planet of origin and make up new terms for these aliens, or start from scratch with something new and more fitting, possibly causing a great upheaval in the world of nomenclature as I do so? Or should I just use plain English for now and let someone else give them fancy names later?
