So I just managed to remove the fork from the old frame I'm renovating. In the headset bearings, the grease looks odd! 

I'm almost done assembling my new bike :) There is still one thing in the way though... See the headset in the picture? It was installed by a professional (or, at least a LBS owner) when I bought the frame. Kinda came preinstalled. After assembling the bike, I went back to the shop to have the headset adjusted. And somehow they couldn't get the thing set up properly. I tried too, and yeah, let's face it, that headset is probably bad or badly installed. 

can I take my (front + rear) hubs apart while it is still attached to the spokes? is it good enough to visually inspect the hub axle, and decide whether it's safe to use based on that? any other safety concern? 

In Belgium at least, you are required to take the bicycle lane on your right if it exists. Yet, sometimes, safety would be higher somewhere else. You should always prioritize safety, and it sometimes requires to do barely legal stuff. In that case anyway, people (and most likely cops) will be understanding if you have a good explanation. Keep on mind though that the roads are usually designed to be as safe as possible, and the guys who designed it had a better overview than you have right now. (Most of the time) But never, ever go on a bike lane in the wrong direction. You would endanger yourself and other unsuspecting users. 

I recently replaced my hubs, and not-so-recently the front brake rotor. In dry conditions, everything works fine, brakes well and makes almost no noise. In rainy conditions, however, the front disk tends to vibrate and make a huge, horn-like noise. Is there something wrong with my brake installation that I should fix, or is this normal? I've never experienced such behavior before. 

They have one big benefit on road / commuting bikes - they stop the valve corroding and seizing due to the salt and crap they get exposed to. On a mountain bike, this isn't such a problem, as the salt gets washed off by puddles and mud (and you tend to wash your mountain bike more). That's been my experience in the muddy, wet UK, when the roads are salted for over half the year. I leave them on the road and commuting bikes, and leave them off the MTB for speed of tyre changing. 

It's perfect for a laptop, and as well as getting the weight off my back it also carries it low on the bike at the front, which doesn't mess up the handling. On those days when I don't have the Brompton, I'm doing a bike / train / bike journey and as the bike legs are short - and during the day I may well have to go to a client on public transport - I use a different messenger style bag. But I definately wouldn't want to use a messenger bag for a long journey, my preference would be to have the luggage on the bike, or to use a backpack. (As an aside to the point about messenger style bags being easy to load and unload, interestingly a lot of photographers - who are also taking things in and out of the bag all day - are moving to sling bags, which can easily be swung around for access and don't have to be taken on and off for access. It's not something you think about until you're using a bag, but being able to access it without needing to take it off is important if you're in and out of it all day). 

If you ride on a trainer some of the time, consider getting a set of rollers. They force you to ride smoothly at a high cadence so you don't bounce up and down, and I've seen them dramatically improve my girlfriend's pedalling technique. They're much better for your technique than a turbo trainer. 

If your goal is comfort over speed, I would emphasize in three upgrades which don't break your bank: 

I've known something like this: $URL$ but I don't know this will work for casual bikes. I also agree with @reiheit, internal geared hub is much more nicer idea. An example of this is bike rental system in Taipei ($URL$ I've been in Taipei for a while, and these bikes were awesome. They had 5 speeds (If my memory is correct.). Moreover, Internally geared hub is less prone to failures, and I think the bikes require less maintenance. 

Since brake cables don't rust, I think the problem is that the cable housing gets dirty with mud or any other substances. The grit inside your housing will increase the friction so the brakes become hard to pull. A way to solve this is to prevent dirt gets inside your housing by investing in good fenders. Moreover, they will help to make the bike cleaner after a ride. Additionally, I used to lubricate the brake cables, but I found this is unnecessary ($URL$ 

The only bad thing about the app builder is the app itself is sluggish over time (something wrong with my browser?), but it's no a big deal, since you can always save a route and refresh the page. Also, If I plan a long route, I've found strava heatmap is pretty useful , although popular routes don't always have the least elevation: $URL$ 

You are asking about converting inner tubes to tubeless. As far as I know, tubeless system isn't 100% puncture proof, if you get a nail on the road, it's impossible to fix right away and you need to call a taxi. For me, inner tubes are still the best options for bike commuting. I can think of several ways: 

Currently, I'm little bit worried about the compatibility of my crankset and the bottom bracket. The crankset is Truvativ Isoflow, the BB is BB-UN55 (Square taper). Yesterday, after the bike hit +1400 km mark, I scheduled maintenance for the crankset. I disassemble the crank arms and the BB, cleaned them, apply grease (I use Phill Wood), and reassemble. However, when I removed the crank arms, I didn't need a crank puller at all. This made me worried that the crank arms might be loose. So what I might want is tigthen the crank bolts. However, on the drive side, the right crank arm already hit "the limit" (see an image below) so it wouldn't go any further in. To the best of my knowledge and according to this specification document, the BB should be compatible with the crankset. Its spindle width is 113mm to achieve 48.5mm chainline (The bike is a single speed), see a table on the bottomleft of the pdf document. Another solution I found on the web is not applying grease on the spindle and the crankarm holes to increase friction. This is what I did. So think the crankarms are tighter right now. So far I have no problem, no creaking noise, and I doubt the crank arms will be fall off anytime soon. However, I'm not sure whether I'll have problems in the future. edit 1: I put some more information:
