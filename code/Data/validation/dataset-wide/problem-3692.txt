Basically, they are all giant versions of rubber bands. As such, when they are near their normal shape, they offer much less resistance. This increases in a (mostly) linear fashion until the stretch limit, so you can calculate resistance just by how much the stretch is. So, if you have a band that is rated 50-100 lbs, with a maximum stretch of 3 feet, it will take 50 lbs of force to start it stretching, from that point it will take 75 lbs of force to stretch it 1.5 feet (18"), and so on. You can also "stack" them to increase initial resistance, and modify the "weight" that you are using. One thing to look for in the flat bands is layered versus molded, as the layered will be tougher and less prone to ripping, which you can avoid by making sure that it isn't wrapped around sharp edges, don't store in sunlight, etc. Did run across this study examining the mechanical resistance of various colored bands, as well as the instruction manual for Thera Bands, which are one of the most popular brands used in injury rehabilitation. 

VO2 = 15 x (max hr/resting hr) VO2 = (d12 - 505) / 45, where d12 is distance covered in meters in 12 minutes of running. 

RICE. Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. For the first 24-72 hours you want all of the above. Rest it as much as possible, wrap and ice (20 mins on at at time, frozen peas/corn work great for icepacks), and keep elevated as much as possible. After that initial period, ice directly after activity to minimize swelling, and you can also use moist heat to "pulse" the area to help drive the fluid out of the area. Compression/tape/support as needed for activity until pain disappears. A rolled ankle can be nothing, or it can be something as serious as an avulsion fracture (piece of bone torn away by the tendon), partial/full ligament tears, etc. If you are more than 5-7 days out and it is still tender/swollen/painful to walk I would go have it checked out. As far as squats/deadlifts, they are linear rather than angular in motion, so you should be fine, but just be aware and limit your lifting if it is painful. 

Chop squats - Put the round side down, stand both feet on the flat. Take a medicine ball and "chop" (Much like a cable pull) from high to low, left to right and squat at the same time the ball comes down. Repeat going the other way for one repetition. One legged deadlift - Done with a swiss ball, stand on the rounded side, foot in the center. Holding the ball out in front of you, lean until it touches, then stand back up. Side touches - Standing on one foot on the ball side (not on the flat), stick your leg out to the side, squat until the toes touch, then back up. Net toss - Requires a large net that you can use to "throw" the ball back to you. (See picture below) : stand on bosu flat side, throw medicine balls into the net and catch coming back. 

No, cholesterol levels being high is not a direct contributor to being out of breath or short of breath. However, one possibility is that if you do have high cholesterol, you have some of the associated problems such as narrowing of the arteries due to plaque buildup, and the reduced blood flow can create the short of breath feeling. I would advise you to go get a physical and have them do a cholesterol test. 

The doctor that recommended that, did he do that specifically because you are myopic? Or is there some other underlying pathology that makes you more susceptible? I have poor eyesight as well (20/300 and 20/400 left and right respectively), and I am in the negative diopters, and I've been active in sports for 40 years, including 9 years of cross country in HS and college, 20 years of martial arts, triathlons, wrestling and weightlifting to support all of the above. I've never had any problems. Simply being nearsighted shouldn't increase the risk for you more than anyone else. However, before I started jumping into all the activity, I would specifically ask your eye doc if there is something in YOUR eyes that makes you more susceptible and what to do if you are, especially if a doc did tell you that in your past. I'll save the writing, I'd give you the same answer for your jogging on asphalt. 

As others have said, start off slow. You didn't gain 150 lbs in a few months, you aren't going to lose 150 lbs in a few months. You will have ups and downs, and your losses will be disproportionately greater in the initial phases of your workouts than they will later on. As others have said, get the doctor's OK first. Start slow. If you really want to get into running, make sure you have new shoes that fit well. That can cause just as much grief as your weight can. Old, broken down shoes are one of the biggest contributors to injuries as much as overwork. My recommendation is to find something to do that you enjoy. If you enjoy it, you are much more likely to keep on doing it. Repetition is the name of the game, being able to do the work day in and day out. That also goes back to the start slow. Everyone seems to thing that if you don't have soreness, you didn't work hard. Horsepuckey. If you work so hard that the next day you can't do anything, you're losing ground not gaining it. Calories are king. Various studies (One of my answers has links to them, I can dig them up if needed) show that the type of diet doesn't really matter, it is calorie reduction that produces results. Your comment about bread is a little misguided. Cutting out entire chunks of a diet isn't really productive. If you like bread, go ahead and eat it. Just don't eat as much of it. And, with your diet, just like with the exercise, go slow. Don't say "Tomorrow I start eating Paleo" or whatever. Instead, tomorrow say "I will replace one of my bad snacks with some fruit and nuts." Do that for a week. Then make another small change. Figure out some realistic goals, and write them down. Make some 6 month, 1 year and 3 year goals. Then figure out the steps needed for each one. Say your 1 year goal is to lose 50 lbs, and be down to 260. Your 6 month goal would be to be working out consistently for four days a week. Your diet goal is to be eating 75% healthy foods. Etc, etc. Figure out SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time limited) goals to where you can make small, consistent changes towards a bigger goal. And, don't get locked into any one activity. Try a bunch. See what you like to do, and just as important, who you like to do it with. If you like the activity, and you have friends that do it with you (or you make new friends in that activity), they will encourage and support you. That's another big element. If you don't enjoy the activity, or you don't like who you do it with, you are much more likely to abandon the program. If you like cycling, great, go ride. If you like gymnastic badminton, have at it. You're not earning a living at it, so enjoy it. Make a good plan, stick to it, and keep your eye on the final prize, you'll get there faster than you think and will enjoy it more than you thought. 

Yes, there are disadvantages in that you won't be stressing your muscles enough to get all the growth that is possible out of each session. Muscle growth is a combination of two different types of hypertrophy, sarcoplasmic and myofibril. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy produces more size, but less strength (This is what is stimulated by the 8-12 rep range), while myofibril hypertrophy produces more strength but less size (2-6 rep range, with higher weights). Also, the muscle responds to micro tears by repairing the tissue, and adding more to try and prevent that kind of injury in the future. If you don't go to overload/failure or near that point, then you are not stressing your muscles to the degree needed to stimulate full growth. You can do things with lots of rest, but you won't get the same training effect as you would with shorter rest intervals, and while you may see growth, it won't be as much as you would see otherwise. 

They are acting as counters for competition. The person beside them is a judge, and the tap is to let them know that they completed a successful repetition, usually accompanied by a verbal count of the reps. There are some types of slaps that are used in boxing and other similar training, to get the muscles used to impact and the pain sensation so that it can be ignored, but this is just a "hey, that's one" type of tap. 

Probably one of your best options is to go to your local college, or hit up Amazon/eBay for a nutrition textbook, preferably one that has an edition that has been printed in the last year or two. As nutrition is an advancing field, anything older than 3+ years is likely to have some outdated information. As far as the diet books in the local bookstore, your best choices will be the ones labeled pretty blandly, and are not of a particular diet (Such as Paleo, South Beach, Atkins, etc.) While these diets may have some validity, many of them are primarily created/written solely for the purpose of selling more information on the created plan. 

Robin is correct on the stretching of ligaments. Ligaments are like the springs in click pens, once they get pulled out, they don't go back as tight as before. This is the reason that once you dislocate a shoulder, it's easier to dislocate again. The other thing is that there aren't really any stretches that you can apply yourself that will tell you that you have a ligament injury. There are three different common diagnostic tests, but they require the leg to be in specific positions, and a second party testing the knee. (Example: Anterior drawer test, requires the hamstrings to be completely relaxed. Since the hamstrings produce actions in two joints, both joints {knee and hip} have to be bent. Once the hamstrings are completely relaxed, the tester draws the knee forward. An excessive amount of forward motion, or lack of "stop" point indicates an injury. Impossible to do this test on yourself.) Edited to add: These are not tests that should be done by you and a buddy. These should be done only by a trained professional, as it requires experience, training and if improperly done, could lead to or worsen injury. Finally, even if you could stretch the area, there is no way for you to specifically pinpoint the pain and say "Yes, that's the ACL". My fear is that you would stretch, get no pain and decide it's ok and then have further injury occur. My best recommendation would be to go in and have a professional take a look, rather than trying to diagnose it yourself. It's possible that you had a very minor injury at the time of the original ACL injury that has just gotten progressively worse over time and is now starting to cause discomfort/pain. Edited to fit better with Nathan's request: Ligaments connect bone to bone. They aren't designed to stretch. The tests for the ACL are basically of the kind where you bend the leg in various ways to completely relax the surrounding muscles (To avoid false negatives), then moving the knee. If the ACL is intact, the knee will have a fairly defined "stop" point, and a limited range of travel. If the ACL (or any of the knee ligaments for that matter) is damaged, the range of travel will be greater and the stop point will feel rather vague. 

The best way to improve your cardiovascular fitness is to do more of whatever it is you are doing, in a tempered, gradual progression. As mentioned above, 5 or 6 weeks is not enough to drastically improve your speed, but you can improve somewhat. Here's what I would recommend for you - 

Note: Much of this is taken from my answer here, as I believe they are similar situations. However, I would disregard the pacing, as I ran your pace through the Macmillan calculator, and I don't see anything indicating that your pace was too ambitious. 

First, I would recommend you commit to the nutrition SE site in Area 51: $URL$ It depends on the supplement, what it is designed for and the composition. It can be very complicated to outline, but there are various nutrients, vitamins and minerals that depend on the presence of other substances to be better absorbed and utilized in the body. For example, on extremely low fat diets, it can be easy to develop a deficiency in fat soluble vitamins, since fat is necessary for transport of the vitamins into the body. If you get all of your necessary nutrients in your "real food" meals, and the supplement shakes are simply to increase calories, then there probably isn't a problem with them (With the caveat that there have been reports of heavy metal contamination in some liquid shakes). If you are relying on them for other things than extra calories and you have the time to prepare meals, then I would do that. I tend to always recommend real food over processed supplements unless there are mitigating factors.
