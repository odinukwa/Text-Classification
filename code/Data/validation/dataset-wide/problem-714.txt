From experience and from what little I've read cadence beats power (and cadence with power is the winner) - in general you want to be turning the pedals more often with less effort in a smooth motion not stomping down each time. To which end you probably want your cadence to be in the 90+ region as consistently as possible (including when climbing) I'm not quite sure where the ideal "band" is any more (is been a long while since I looked at this) but I think I was aiming for something like 85 to 105. What I do recall, quite vividly, from racing the recumbent round velodromes was that changing down and getting the cadence back in band would usuall result in me going faster for a similar amount of effort (given that I had very little in reserve at the time). I think that most of us (definitely the case for me at the moment) don't use a high enough cadence and I believe it is worth making the effort to pay attention to and to improve your cadence - but it is something you have to positively work at in the first instance. 

I have lots of bikes and lots of interesting wheel sizes, I would like to know how to calculate the right spoke lengths for a wheel. I appreciate that there are probably rather a lot of variables but this is something that has been an issue for me from time to time so being able to work out the right spoke length for an arbitrary wheel (did I mention that I have half a dozen or more different wheel sizes in the garage?) would be useful. To be clear - I don't want a calculator, I want to know what the sums are. 

You've essentially just described the 100 mile time trial, which is fairly popular event in the British time trial scene (and perhaps elsewhere, too). The idea in a time trial is simply to complete the given course as quickly as possible. They're ridden on specialised TT bikes and are usually held on roads that have as few junctions as possible, so as to minimise traffic interactions. Most people manage to complete the course without ever coming to a stop. The 100 mile TT is probably the longest milestone in TT distances where it's practical to keep riding without any stops (the next one up in the British TT scene is the 12-hour TT, although the cycling part of an Ironman is 112 miles). Many competitors have helpers stationed along the way to pass up drinks as they pass. While this sort of event will take a decent amount of training (it's probably similar in effort to running a marathon), it's certainly doable! The record for this distance, set in 2015, stands at 3 hours, 18 minutes, and 54 seconds – although most people will take over 4 hours. 

The KMC website suggests using a MissingLink 7/8R 7.1mm (although others should work as well, as mikes points out). 

The cycle computer will over-report your speed by a factor of , which amounts to about 2%. The speed calculated by the computer is , so if the circumference is 2% too big, then the speed will also be over-reported by 2%. Conversely, your actual speed will be about 2% smaller than what your cycle computer reports: a factor of . So if the computer says you're moving at 30 km/h, you'll actually be moving at about 29.3 km/h. The average speed will scale in exactly the same way as the instantaneous speed. In general, if your true wheel circumference is , the value you've put into the computer is , and the reported speed is , then the true speed will be . 

I do the supermarket run every week by bicycle - have done for about 7 years Family of four so I more or less fill a full size shopping trolley every time. This is made possible by a Christiana Trailer which is pretty much equivalent in load capacity to a shopping trolley: 

The answer to the revised question is an easy one: When the cyclist is being a pedestrian and not a cyclist And in the UK at least that distinction is fairly clear - if you're on the bike and riding you're a cyclist and if you're off and pushing you're a pedestrian (and there is case law to back this up). Grey areas? - none strictly (-: But in practical terms across the pavement from or to where you park at the start or end of the journey and maybe the odd place else where there are no pedestrians (but even then with a lot of care) but to my mind absolutely not en-route (I tend not to use a route that involves a "cyclists dismount" sign more than once since the second time I need to make the journey I will know better...) 

Interestingly, there was a point where studies (too long ago for me to even begin to remember sources) suggested that cyclists were probably less affected by pollution because, as a consequence of the regular exercise they were taking, their lungs were more efficient and so needed less air (and hence pollutants) to get the same oxygen. This was perhaps somewhat mitigated by being outside rather than in a box with filtered air (and the filtering has got more efficient). What this means in practical terms - if the studies were right - is that you don't need to be specifically concerned as a cyclist but that doesn't mean that air quality isn't an issue you should be concerned about as an inhabitant of or visitor to a city. 

That looks like a Cervélo RS (from some time around 2008) with an aftermarket Easton EC90 fork and DT Swiss wheelset fitted. You can find a review of the bike from when it was released here. 

For XC and trail use it'll be fine. It's really only downhill bikes that require especially strong stems, I think (and in that case you'd likely be using a shorter stem anyway for handling reasons). 

Yes, you can, although you'll need a longer chain to go with it. The important thing here is the capacity of the rear mech you're using. However, since your bike already has 50/36 11-32 gearing, changing the chainset for a 52/39 actually reduces the amount of chain slack the rear mech has to deal with (52-39 < 50-36), so there shouldn't be any problem. Just remember to adjust the position of the front mech (move it up the seat tube) to accommodate the larger chainrings. 

Your mileage may vary here; if the filling comes off after riding, you might be looking at a new CSU if you want a complete fix. The fork will still work, of course, but a gap will allow dirt into the lower legs, which will effectively shorten the service interval on the fork. I've successfully repaired a nick in a Fox RP2 rear shock like this, and it's still going strong today. However, it didn't work so well on the stanchions of my TALAS 32, since the filling wouldn't stick for more than a couple of rides. 

It really depends how deep the scratch is. If it's deep enough, then a new CSU (crown-steerer unit) is the only sure-fire fix. However, here are some steps I've taken in the past, which have given me some success: 

It turns out the tyre wasn't fine; here it is 2000km later. The tyre has split in two places on one side, and the bond between the bead and the sidewall looks pretty compromised all the way around. Thankfully it didn't blow out while I was on the bike! 

Attachment to the bike A "quick" release mechanism so you can, if you want, separate the bike from the trailer Achieving a universal joint of some sort (or at least sufficient degrees of freedom to avoid any unpleasantness 

I have 3 trailers and have previously owned a fourth (which was my first) each of which has had a different attachment mechanism. You have 3 issues to address: 

It works i.e. it puts a lot of air in the tyres efficiently (hard to evaluate but it is key). Big, clear, gauge - at the top - with a "target" marker so your getting the right pressures Smarthead - don't have to worry about presta or schraeder just push it on and lift the lever Very stable in use - big base to put one's foot etc. Solid. Very solid. If you put everything away properly the hose loops through a hook, there's a hole to park the head and there a "hook" so that you can carry it by the handle. Last but not least, its still working a lot of years. 

I have a bike that is now dedicated to the role of towing this beastie (for the supermarket run and for the Saturday morning run to the Greengrocer and the Butcher). Would only give it up for an actual cargo bike/trike 

The keys are 2, 3 and 4 the rest are bonus features that differentiate it from the alternatives. For what its worth, its a Topeak Jo Blow Pro - but what resemblence mine bears to a current model is unknown. 

The crudest connection I have is for my shopping trailer (a Christiana from Denmark) - this is a substantial lump of stiff rubber that has a hole for the seatpost and a long "tongue" that goes to the trailer drawbar over the back wheel of the bike, there's then a pin through the drawbar to hold it in place. This is not a particularly elegant solution, but it works. You get rotation of the rubber round the seatpost and then both up and down and twist from the rubber tongue. I've managed to put the trailer on its side with a combination of a pothole whilst being a bit too keen when the trailer was empty and the bike stayed upright... The other three all attach to the bike around the rear axle/chainstay. First was a Winchester child trailer which had a j clamp to go around the seatstay and, I think, something springlike to provide the articulation - not quick to attach/detach but pretty effective when on. Contemporary trailers often use "Weber" connection components for which are, I believe, available for purchase. Third is the attachement for our Bike Friday Triplet - a plug and socket arrangement, plug clamped very firmly to the rear seat stay and the socket on the draw bar. Right here, right now I can't remember how it articulates (but it does). Second - and last because its by far my favourite (simple, elegant and effective!) is for my Radical Cyclone. Bike end is a ball on bit of bent metal that goes over the rear axle and is clamped in place by whatever holds you back wheel on already. Trailer end is a polymer cup with a sprung steel cap to hold it in place. You can see both on their accessories page. I've used this trailer for touring - you barely know its there apart from the fact that you go more slowly (even more slowly in my case). All of the above work more than adequately well. Articulation can be provider by a ball and socket, by a universal joint - multiple "hinges" (this is how a BoB trailer works horizontal through the axle, vertical at the trailer and no need for "twist" to cope with the lean of the bike as its single wheel and therefore will lean with the bike) or by having something that will physically bend and twist (spring, rubber). 

There may be others brands that use a similar design, but I think ISM is the best known. The idea is that most of your weight is supported on the frontal prongs, rather than the flat area at the back. They have a gap in the middle to avoid putting pressure on your perineum. For this reason they're especially popular among time triallists and triathletes because they allow you to rotate your pelvis forward more comfortably. They feel quite different to conventional saddles, mostly because of the extra width at the front, and will probably take some getting used to. The image came from this review. 

If you want a saddle that takes pressure off your sit bones (ischial tuberosities), this design is probably appropriate: 

This lacing pattern is actually explicitly recommended by Shimano and Magura for rear disc hubs. Under braking, the leading spokes will be in tension, while under drive the trailing spokes will be in tension. The tension acts to straighten out the spokes, pushing the spokes on the other side of the flange outward from the flange centre line. I don't know if anyone has measured this effect, but I imagine it's negligible for most purposes. Nonetheless, according to Roger Musson, old-fashioned disc brake designs used to have very tight clearances between the caliper and the NDS spokes, so you would want the leading NDS spokes to be on the outside at the final cross to avoid contact with the caliper under braking. This is irrelevant to your wheel because it doesn't have disc brakes. Conversely, there's an argument that the DS spokes should be laced the opposite way around to avoid contact with the mech cage under drive load when on the biggest sprocket. This seems even more tenuous to me, given how small drive forces are in comparison with braking forces. Either way, it's consistent with what's observed on your wheel. I'm not sure how much merit any of these arguments have – would be nice to know if someone's measured it. But in any case, asymmetric lacing patterns have some favour among the big names in the industry, at least for disc brake set-ups. 

I have to add this - though will probably get mauled for it... Ride a recumbent (-: Ok, I accept that this is probably not a practical answer to the problem - its also the case that recumbents have their own issues with being in the seat for extended periods of time (e.g. numb bums) but in terms of comfort overall I know which I'd rather cover 50 miles on. 

The question is marginal 'cos its asking about specifics which change over time and products which are not necessarily universally available. My (very wonderful) trackpump has certain attributes that make me like it but given that its at least 6, more likely 8 or 10 years old so... better to define the things that make me like it: 

If you use a trailer its pretty much the same as using a pushchair (stroller) and indeed some double up (I wouldn't get one that doesn't) - you'll get a 5 point harness, a seat that reclines and you can get head cushions and the like too. Of course a trailer may not be practical in your circumstance (though I'd be surprised) but if it is it also helps deal with the problem of all the other stuff you want to carry when going out with a small child. One other option for practical as opposed to more recreational use is a cargo bike or trike of some sort - I'd've loved one of these a Nihola or a Christiana Trike - in which you can put the same seat/carrier you'd use in a car 'til they're of a size to sit up. There are also Dutch cargo bikes that can similarly be equipped with benches, rain covers, etc. But I'd probably still have wanted a trailer too for longer rides (-:
