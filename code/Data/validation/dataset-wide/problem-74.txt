Guinea pigs and slaves What do we have here? On the one hand, not very intelligent and dangerous to the civilians barbarians. I'm pretty sure that, despite all the civil rights' activists' efforts, those giants won't get equal rights to humans for many decades. Not only that, but their movement in cities would be heavily regulated, if not outright outlawed. And considering that even human slavery still encompasses millions of people, those giants would be used as cheaper and more efficient labour with no hesitation (especially in Russia). They would be lucky just to get enough to eat, never mind seeing any money. On the other hand, they clearly posses some "magic" in their bodies, that makes them not only survive, but invert the square-cubic law. That would make many biologists around the world very interested in dissecting and examining giants. Again, depending on a laboratory that captured a giant, they would be lucky to just survive and be fed. 

This is actually more plausible than it seems. I remember reading an article (will try to find it later and add a link) dealing with modelling of a large fire in a certain modern city (can't recall which one exactly, but I think it was Moscow). The surprising result was, above a certain size/intensity, the fire was self-sustaining, with concrete burning and immense winds fanning those flames and spreading them over hundreds of meters. It had something to do with regular layout of buildings directing winds in a special way. Of course, that study was assuming the "candle" dropped was a medium-sized nuke, which isn't exactly what you were looking for. However, I find it quite plausible that, if you pick the point (or points) right (and modern computational resources can help you find the winning setup), you could start a similar self-sustaining fire on a smaller scale at first. Such a fire could grow to envelop few building blocks within an hour, which is fast enough to avoid being extinguished too soon. After that, regular firemen would be unable to do anything, while extraordinary measures will take some time to get approval â€” time that the fire will use to engulf the whole city (and millions of civilians trying to flee in panic won't help either). 

"Ok...", said Xaxhazztrax the Daemon Chairman, "Sog's rain idea was a flop. Clearly the humans aren't Deep Ones. Good thing one of them built a floating box." It was unclear to the assembly exactly how the human had gotten all the animals into his vessel, but hoary Nodens looked a bit smug. Then again, hoary Nodens always looked smug. Who invited him anyway? Was he even part of their pantheon? "So what do we do now?", a lesser servitor of Miihyagaa piped, his mistress silently brooding with her seven eyes fixed into the aether as usual. "We've given them fire, that didn't work. We've given them water, that didn't work. My mistress proposes that we call this project quits." There was a general murmur of agreement. "No!" Zblu'tras said firmly. "Our mistake was clearly focusing on altering their environment. They seem to have adapted well to it. We need to ennoble their spirits. I shall give them... art." 

Please note that the dolphins brain (left) is roughly the same size or and in possession of more gyri and sulci than the human brain (right) and yet the dolphins have not invented fire, thermonuclear war or market economy, but instead just swimmed around eating fish and making wicked back flips. So the case for intelligence may be circumstantial. An octopus brain looks completely different from a mammal brain. It is more or less completely alien to us. They seem to have a distributed brain with the majority of their neurons actually residing in their arms (which have some semi-autonomous control over movement and their own sense of taste) and a lot of it's processing capacity seems to go towards instinctively controlling a highly complex body. So what is required for your tetrapi to be smart? Well... actually most likely not much. They are probably already smart (as I recall there is a Question regarding this already on the site, you should check it out if you can find it) and what they lack is social structure (cephalopods being known for being solitary, aggressive, and canibalistic by nature, although there is evidence for them to be surprisingly social as well... so you probably need to talk to an cephalopod specialist, not me). From what I have understood, though, the main case against cephalopod civilization is not their brains nor their smarts but rather physical limitations in terms of life span and gestation. They spawn their young in a fire and forget way and never care for the offspring, which puts limits on social development. Also they die after spawning, making it hard to become a venerable elder and carry on the legends of your people. Solve those things (moving from water to air will probably do that actually as hatching a litter of a thousand might not be a viable strategy compared to carrying the young internally) and you'll find there actually may be no limit to your cephalopods. 

Obviously, it depends on the way magic works, but we can ask a more generic question. Can a healer kill? Imagine a surgeon with a scalpel in his vic^W patient. Can he kill? Of course, it takes him a lot of precision and control not to kill. And if your healer can use his healing magic on his opponent, then, figuratively speaking, he has his scalpel in him already. Now all he needs is to twist it just the wrong way. 

Use a method similar to that used on some submarines: filling tanks with seawater when you need to go down (get heavier), and emptying them when you need to go up (get lighter). Just like with submarines, air is all around you, and in compressed form it has quite a high density of 870 kg/m^3, pretty close to that of water. Equipment for liquefying air appeared at the start of 20th century in our world, so it should be quite possible with your level of technology. So just have air tanks distributed around your ship, and fill them with liquid air when you need to compensate for mass loss. In a normal state you will probably want them about half-full, to allow for both gain and loss. 

The main problem of the recycling souls idea is this: it assumes that creation of souls is separate from creation of bodies. And you can turn this problem to your advantage. Simply put, either there is a fixed and finite amount of souls, or there is some sort of mechanism of creating additional souls that is not tied to actual procreation. As long as the latter mechanism has a limited throughput, sometimes a situation may arise when there are fewer souls available that there are bodies born. A locust swarm got a good year and grew thrice the usual size? Nearby forests will be teeming with undead animals, and nearby villages will have plenty of children born soulless. Also, if souls can be created, then souls can be destroyed in one way or another. A soul-splitting bomb may be used to turn enemy city to undeath, or a natural disaster can bring about a localised zombie apocalypse. Souls travel from dead bodies and later to newborn bodies. Both of those processes can be disturbed: souls of the dead can be captured to prevent their departure or to inflict punishment beyond the grave; newly arriving souls can be delayed till the body turns to undeath. There could be some sort of a magical crystal that dampens souls, and a cave system full of those crystals would house an undead colony, with undead giving birth to more undead. 

Nine foot tall isn't that horribly oversized. Closer to a fantasy game Ogre than a giant so I don't think a sword would be that out of place. I know people recommend maces and clubs for all sorts of practical reasons, but like Palahvan wrote earlier the Armorslayer would make a very good choice and probably make him a horribly fearsome opponent. Although, if you want to maintain the swordlike thrusting (which might be an huge advantage if you've got 1.3 times the reach of your opponent) you might want to go for a Falcata. I'm by no means a swords expert so I can't tell if there was ever a two-handed version of the Falcata, but I can't see a good reason why not. (Someone with sword fighting experience may be able to tell us whether this is feasible or not. Remember that any material strenght issues are handwaved though as are - probably - the issue of wielder strenght.) There are two-handers in the same general sword family though. Most notably the Falx and also the Rhomphaia but they do not seem to have been designed with the heavy axe-like tip, rather they were hook- or sickle-like but of course fearsome in their own right. Also, if we're doing magic, are we doing enough magic to make it flaming, electrical or frosty if not for damage then at least for visual effect? 

While champion warfare was mentioned, it never was the method to determine a victor, merely a way to gain morale advantage before upcoming battle. As it stands, I don't find it quite plausible that no ruler will abuse reluctance of others to go to war. Politics were always a messy business, not a matter of chivalry. And if you are going to backstab a neighbour instead of honouring duel results, you are going do it in a way that puts you at advantage, without any lengthy wars. However, you have what would make it much more believable with some adjustment: the Empire. If mountains aren't quite high enough to prevent it dealing with any one kingdom, then all kingdoms could've entered a loose defensive confederation of sorts. Something like the Holy Roman Empire of their own, but without the Emperor. With a Diet for passing confederation-wide edicts and laws. Of course, still resolving conflicts with a duel wouldn't occur right from the start, there wouldn't be enough trust between participants yet. But it can be passed by the Diet later on as a way of resolving conflicts without being too detrimental to the overall defensive capability. And since now this is the will of all the kingdoms, not honouring the result of a conflict resolution would put make a lot of people angry with you, not just your victim. 

While other answers deal with availability of metal armour, there is also another aspect to your question: usability. Carrying a dozen kilograms of metal may be only mildly annoying on a flat road, but carrying the same amount while alternately climbing and descending at a steep rate and in the thin air of few kilometres of elevation will either force you to severely limit your marching speed, or exhaust your to the point of being unable to fight. Simply put, warfare in mountains often favours smaller, faster units of lighter skirmishers, which makes heavy metal armour not as desirable. If your kingdom does not seek to expand into flatlands, and adopts hit-and-run tactics, it doesn't really make sense for them to use metal armour beyond protection of their leaders. Another reason for leather armour would lie in the (relative) abundance of leather. Most mountainous societies relied on hunting significantly more, than other countries, simply because there was less arable land (even with quite advanced alpine agriculture techniques some of them used, like Inca). And with hunting, you get not only meat, but leather as well. So, a kingdom of leather-clad hunters in the mountains is quite plausible. In fact, you can just take a look at the medieval kingdoms of Caucasus for an inspiration of just that.
