That is just a /t/ sound, not a morpheme. This makes as much sense as asking where the /n/ in near and nickel come from. The words night, fight, and others like right historically had a fricative before the /t/, and words like through and rough ended in that fricative (compare English through [θɹu:] with German durch [dʊɐ̯çç]). In Middle English, the fricative likely varied regionally, and it inconsistently either deleted (through, plough, night, fight, wight, drought) or became [f] (rough, trough, enough) in Modern English. Just because night and fight end in -ght it does not mean that sound was one morpheme. It just happens to be the consonant cluster they ended in. 

Of course the two above sentences would both be highly ungrammatical in any American, Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian English dialects. 

One language I speak, Polish, has a fairly asymmetric vowel inventory despite having only 9* vowel phonemes (if you count the nasal diphthongs as vowels, that is) /i/ /ɪ/ /ɛ/ /ɛ̃ w/ /ɔ/ /ɔ̃ w/ a/ (The vowel [e] occurs as an allophone before /j/ or a palatalised consonant, the and /ɔ/ occurs as [o] before /w/ or /l/) There are two high front vowels, and the default tends to be +lax/-tense, rather than +tense/-lax (which is fairly unexpected). So there are languages with asymmetric vowel inventories, but none as extreme as only having front vowels. There are many reasons why this wouldn't happen, or would be highly improbable. For example, there is a tendency for languages to end up with an asymmetric inventory if [u] shifts forward to [y] or [ʉ], and sometimes to even shift forward to [y] and then un-round to [i]. Usually, what happens though, is the vowel does not shift forward before [k] [x] or another velar consonant, and then they wind up in allophonic variation, or over time, even in phonemic variation. Another tendency is for [o] to raise and fill the place of where [u] used to be. So let's say a 5 vowel inventory language has: /i/ /u/ /e/ /o/ /a/ It shifts: /i/ /y/~/u/ /e/ /o/ /a/ Then, a few generations later we have: /i//y/ /u/ (o shifted up) /e/ /a/ Or even: /i//y/ /u/ (the vowel became contrastive) /e/ /o/ /a/ *There is debate on even this in Polish, sadly. The controversy is over the front vowels, and whether the contrastive vowel is [ɪ] or [ɨ]. In many Slavic languages, such as Russian, there are two vowels in allophonic distribution: one occurs after palatalised consonants and /k/ [i], the other after non-palatalised consonants [ɨ]. Sanders (2003) identified the Polish vowel as [ɪ], at least in Warsaw Polish. In Polish, the only consonants with a palatalisation contrast are the bilabials, and before a back vowel. Some Slavicists like to transcribe the bilabials before /i/ as being something like [mʲ] instead of [m]. If you don't do this for pure consistency-with-other-Slavic-languages concerns, it is fairly obvious that /ɪ/ and /i/ are minimal pairs: /mi/ 1sg-DAT /mɪ/ 'we' /bitɕ/ 'to beat' /bɪtɕ/ 'to be' They are phonemic at least in the environment of bilabials.

For further discussion I'd suggest looking into Haider (2004) on the matter. He's far from uncontroversial in general, but pages 782ff. illustrate a nice further contrast between German NPs and VPs which was previously discussed as the 'head-final filter': ungrammatical: die schneller(e) als Bolt Frau ('the faster than Bolt woman') vs grammatical: schneller als Bolt rennen ('faster than Bolt run'). These examples the English translations are supposed to show that the head-initial phrases do not allow, that the head of a modifying phrase is non-adjacent to the modified head. That is, it is not a general property of German to allow for non-head-adjacent modifying phrases, but it a property of its head-final phrases (VP and AP) only. This is just to illustrate one further putative difference between these phrases. Here's the doi-link, so it should be stable: Haider (2004). Apart from Haider being controversial, I'm not aware of any researcher who claims that the German NP is head-final. Also note that the head-initiality of the majority of phrases among the languages of Europe was surely one of the main reasons for Kayne (1994) to claim that every phrase is basically head-initial. 

There's a series of replies between David Adger and Adele Goldberg at lingbuzz: $URL$ $URL$ Summing up two points of Adger's criticism: first, CxG admits hundreds of innate capabilities, such as innate capabilities for vision and social interaction (Tomasello), but there's such a hassle about that one tiny bit of possible innate language capabilities. So, why are all of those other innate capabilities acknowlegded so easily, why is language such an exception in being an ability that depends entirely on other innately dispositioned capabilities? Second, CxG claims, that what appears as grammatical rules are abstractions over constructions. This view is problematic for cases that do not occur as part of the input. Here, Adger cites Yang (see answer from Mr. Hilbert), and he mentions the phenomenon of parasitic gaps: speakers of English have no problems in distinguishing between the grammatical and ungrammatical cases of parasitic gaps even though these kinds of structure are more or less non-existent in corpora. These structures can be captured by a a rules-type grammar, but how would a CxG-type analysis of parasitic gaps look like? From which kind of schemata are parasitic gaps abstractions? How can there be shemata for constructions that are not represented in the input? So first, there is a problem in the premises, and second, there is a problem in descriptive adequacy or weak explanatory adequacy. The second problem could simply be addressed by just proposing how a CxG analysis of parasitic gaps would look like, but in her replies, Goldberg does not address the issue of how to analyse parasitic gaps. 

For #3, for all of the vowels before /ɹ/, look at the phonetic environment. There's your explanation for why floor is [flɔɹ]. In very few dialects of Modern English, is [u:ɹ] even a sequence that is allowed. In my native dialect of English (Pacific Northwest American English), that segment is only phonotactically allowed if the [ɹ] is its own syllable. So brewer is [bɹu:w(ə)ɹ̩ ]. This is also true for me of [l]. Fool and fuel are definitely two syllables for me: [fuwəɤ̯ ]~[fuɫ̩ ] and [fjuwəɤ̯ ]~[fjuɫ̩ ] This is also true for my girlfriend, who speaks Australian English. So, we can surmise that when */o:/ became /u:/, it then lowered before [_l] and [_ɹ] in most dialects of English. For phonological splits, those are more tricky. In Southern British dialects of Early Modern English, there was another shift after the Great Vowel Shift called the FOOT~STRUT split. In Northern England and Scotland, as well as some dialects in Ireland, the vowels in FOOT is the same as the vowel in STRUT and FLOOD. Liverpool speakers would pronounce the vowel in FLOOD, RUN and SUN the same way they pronounce it in HOOD, FOOT, and BOOK. Here's a map of England where the Isoglosses of this split are, per Wikipedia (this is the vowel for SUN in various British dialects): 

No, at least no documented languages have only front vowels. The general explanation for this is given by various theories for vowel dispersion. Schwartz, Boë, and Abry (1997) summarise one of these theories pretty well. Basically, there is a strong tendency for languages to spread their vowels evenly. Most theorise that this is because of learnability, others because of articulatory economy (Lindblom, 1975), others because they think systems self-organise in nature (de Boer, 2000). In 3 vowel systems, the most common vowels are /a/ /i/ /u/ with lots of speaker variation. In 5 vowel systems it tends to add in /e/ and /o/, 6 vowel systems most often add in a mid vowel like schwa. 7 or higher start getting rounding contrasts. There are languages with asymmetric vowel inventories. Many dialects of Danish have a highly asymmetric vowel inventory, with about twice as many front vowels as back vowels. Australian English also has a slightly asymmetric vowel inventory, with only 3 back vowels out of 11 monophongal minimal pairs. 

I'd suggest the following article (Nerbonne, 2010) for an applied example using a phonological approach as described in user6726's post; the link is a DOI, so it should be stable: doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2010.0048 

Under the assumption that the corresponding WALS articles have been read, I'll give a short explanation for why the German value is 'both' for feature 125, which can be easily carried over to the other values as well. Purposive clauses in German can (i.a.) be formed with the 'zu infintive', as in (1), or with a finite clause introduced by the preposition damit ('such that'), as in (2). 

The NPs of all Germanic languages are head-initial. Headedness is determined on the basis of the distribution of complements, not modifiers; the distribution of modifiers only correlates with the distribution of complements. (1) destroy the city (2) the destruction of the city The complement obligatorily follows the head. The contrast can be seen more nicely in German, where VP is head-final (3) while NP is head-initial (4), such that the position of the complement changes on behalf of the category of the head. (3) die Stadt zerstören 

So in (1), the deranked (because infinite) form is used to form a purposive clause whereas in (2) a balanced (because finite) form is used. You can see from the translations why English also has the 'both' value for feature 125. In Turkish, on the other hand, there are no finite purposive clauses (most likely converbial constructions will be used in Turkish). In French, you only have the pour V-INF construction. So, you can just look at these values through the finite/non-finite lense to begin with. 

As you can infer from my examples, the split affected not only Middle English */o:/ but also Middle English */u:/: 

Under an exemplar theory approach, we would expect new words to be less innovative than high frequency words because a speaker hears less of them. References: Hay, J., Drager, K., & Thomas, B.

A phonological split where one phone becomes two in either allophonic or phonemic variation. Lexical diffusion; sound changes actually don't often happen with every single word in the language all at once. We can see this from sound changes happening right now, more later with examples and references. Different environments. 

Is this your homework assignment? *'Boys loves to cry.' Person agreement. *'She didn't went to the market.' Tense. A Generativist model would probably explain this as 'do' occupying the spot where tense normally is licensed. However, there are languages where double tense marking is grammatical (and also double person agreement; this is even found in one Indo-European Language: Bulgarian). 'They are going for the party, isn't it?' Actually this is grammatical. In some dialects of English in the UK this is grammatical. In many dialects, the clitic innit can be used even when referring to plural subjects, and even to personal pronouns. 'Isn't it' has been grammaticalised as a negative tag question: 'Dogs are in the room, innit?' 'You like pizza, innit?' Essentially, 'isn't it' can be used to mean:
