Edit to the above - as noted in the comments. The UGC 'grants' were block grants provided by government to universities, and not to be confused (as I did above) with student grants, which were paid by LEAs. Therefore the statement above that "that the abolition of the UGC was intended as a precursor to the introduction of student loans" is not correct. I do suspect that the reforms were part of the doctrinaire increase of government power over a semi-autonomous body, and the move away from viewing the government as the sole-source provider of financing to universities via the block grants towards a view of universities seeking funding from public and private sources. However a fuller answer depends on somebody with more specialist knowledge than I have. 

This isn't an answer so much as a dispute of the validity of the question... The original question reads very much like an essay question set by a teacher, however if so, I think the teacher set a bad question. The question should have been something like 'What factors contributed to the rise of national identity in the high middle ages?' The reason I say that is that, although some of the geographic areas that we now consider 'nation states' arose first during the medieval period, the monarchies that ruled them were often only tangentially or accidentally aligned with those 'nations'. Many European monarchies were clearly non-national in nature until long after the medieval period ... just look at Germany, Italy, Denmark-Norway, the Low Countries, Spain... Monarchies that corresponded with geographic areas we would now called nations were almost the exception, not the rule. Yet at the same time self-conscious national identity did develop in many areas - England, Scotland, France, Denmark probably being the clearest examples. That national identity, however, was much more a feature of the later middle ages (1300-1500) than the 'high' middle ages. 

I'm always suspicious of modern diagnoses of ancient illnesses. At best it's educated guesswork. Given that most modern doctors are unwilling to give a firm diagnosis of a patient without a proper physical examination, and carefully avoid guessing based simply on reported symptoms (let along second-hand reported symptoms), why would anyone think it's possible to diagnose an illness that happened 1100 years ago, and for which only a secondary source account survives? Nevertheless, the association of Alfred with Chron's disease is a more educated guess than some. What can be reasonably relied upon is that Alfred had a lifelong problem with his bowels. The full article is here Could Alfred have known of possible benefits of Frankincense and made use of them to alleviate his symptoms? 

There is no formal process by which one country would declare its independence from another country. However, the most common form has been to simply declare your intentions to operate as an independent entity and then hope that the international community will recognize your claim. Historically, this has been done by a number of countries. In South America, Brazil used to be a colony of Portugal until the Brazilians declared heir independence in 1822. Portugal rattled their sabres but ultimately came to a diplomatic agreement in exchange for compensation. Guyana gained independence from the UK in 1966 after becoming a repoublic. They now remain as a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. In West Africa, the Republic of Guinea declared their independence from France in 1958. The French didn't have the means or desire to oppose it, so they were able to establish their own country. There are no doubt other examples, but the main point is that it usually came about simply by one country declaring their independence. From there, it is a combination of things that determine their success. Primarily, there is the willingness of the "mother country" to acknowledge and accept this declaration, and secondly there is the willingness of other countries in the international community to recognize it. 

I believe Sun Tzu's comments were meant to be more cautionary than anything. A commander has to consider the consequences of such an action in order to make a more informed decision. If you need to conduct a forced march to obtain a strategic advantage, such as cutting off the enemy supply line or gaining control of a water crossing before they can, then you need to be aware that you will not be at full operating strength once you get there. If the objective can't be obtained with less than your full strength, then you may have to decide another course of action. Quite simply, a forced march can be applied to any march during which the troops are expected to move at a faster pace than normal. In the Marines, they gave us plenty of opportunities to "practice"! This was one of our lessons in Officer Candidate School, and by witnessing it first hand in a training exercise, it gave you a better appreciation for the limitations of your troops if you decided to take such action. 

I answer pretty much every question here with 'it depends'. This one is no exception: It depends what you mean by 'religious'. Did the 'average person' believe in a supernatural being? Yes ... 'non-belief' or atheism simply do not exist in the European middle ages. Simply put - absolutely everyone was religious, if you take 'believing in God (or perhaps gods)' as the qualifier. However if you take 'religious' to mean something more specific - such as regular church-going, or adherence to the strict tenets of the medieval Church, the answer would be very different. At the peasant level, it's pretty well established that Christianity could mix with all manner of other beliefs and superstitions to create something that was far from standard religiosity. Moreover, the Church did not set great store by attendance at church by the general population. A peasant might be expected to attend Church at Easter or Christmas, but the rest of the year was pretty much optional. (Paying your tithes - not optional, of course). The main 'business' of the church was not seen as providing a service to the rank and file population, but instead it was the carrying out of masses and prayer in the great monasteries, priories and cathedrals. The religious well-being of the individual was far subsidiary to the interests of the great churches, and parishes and parish clergy quickly came to be primarily tools by which money was syphoned upwards to the canons, prebendaries, deans, archdeacons, priors, bishops and abbots. Saying so is not to criticize the pre-Reformation Church, but rather to simply point out that it was in those offices that society viewed the primary concerns of the church to lie. It is only later generations that have come to see the religious care of the individual as the church's 'main job'. So another way to answer your question would be to say - everybody was religious, but the majority of people were perhaps hardly more regular churchgoers (or more interested in the Church) than a modern agnostic. 

We won't know whether Duns Scotus faced any hostility for his Scottishness, but we can't expect the perceptions of nationhood and nationality in the late 13th century that would exist if there was a war today. People living in lowland Scotland near to the modern border in the 1290s did not necessarily think of themselves as Scottish, or loyal to a Scottish 'nation'. Certainly they might well have thought themselves to have had more in common culturally and linguistically with the English that the highland and Gaelic-speaking Scots. As a member of religious orders, Duns Scotus was moreover an 'employee', if you like, of the world's largest pan-national organisation, the Church, which did not distinguish people or judge people based on nationality. Yes, we do know that King Robert Bruce made it his business to make the the noble landowning classes choose a side, by preventing the cross-border landowning which had happened before, but that did not apply to ecclesiastics, who could take benefices or positions wherever they could find them, and continued to do so until the Reformation. So, while Duns Scotus's very name emphasizes how his place of origin was well understood by contemporaries, being identified as a Scot did not necessarily mean that Scotus was perceived as automatically a supporter of an independent Scotland contrary to the claim of Edward I, or a supporter of Robert Bruce. Scotus' political loyalties will remain a matter of conjecture, but were more likely to be coloured by local South East Scottish family loyalties than an inherent sense of Scottish nationhood or loyalty to his 'nation' of birth. In fact many much more prominent clerics than Scotus remained loyal to the English 'overlord', Edward I and II, even as late as the 1320s. Finally, it should be noted that Scotus actually spent much of his later life in Paris and Cologne, from 1302 to his death in 1308. It could be that his move to the continent was associated with a desire to lecture in a more supportive environment for Scots than Oxford. However, Duns Scotus's loyalties may have been more to the Church than any secular power, and he was fired from his position in Paris for a time for supporting the pope in a dispute with the French crown. Finally, the stage of the Wars of Independence in which Duns Scotus was alive was a period in which Scotland underwent periods of complete conquest when the Wars of Independence appeared to be over. From an English perspective, those limited forces that continued to withstand the English victory were small groups of rebels resisting the legitimate government, not the united Scottish nation at war with England. Being Scottish did not ipso facto mean anti-English. 

I'm not sure that this was all that common as a means of overtaking a besieged castle. Perhaps more than anything else, it was intended to have a psychological effect on the occupants. As for how they defended themselves, quite honestly they couldn't. The most common means of handling this was to designate individuals who were responsible for gathering the carcasses as soon as possible and burning them to try to prevent the spread of any disease. I don't recall reading anywhere about a siege breaking because of the plague or any other disease. More often than not it was due to lack of food or water. I believe there may have been some hope by the attackers that the diseased or rotted bodies would hit the town's wells and spoil any internal supply of water that the town may have. 

Gettysburg was pretty much a last ditch effort by Lee and Jefferson Davis to save the Confederacy or at least give it some credibility. There were different objectives that led to the attack in the first place. For one thing, the war in the West was going against the Confederates, and if the West fell, and more importantly access to the Mississippi River, then opportunities for resupply would be lost. Another consideration was that by obtaining a victory at Gettysburg, Lee and his army would be poised to threaten Philadelphia and New York. They would also have access to fresh farmland and supplies that they could take from the North, rather than being so dependent on the already depleted resources of Virginia and the rest of the South. By threatening two of the largest Northern cities, Lee would have been in a position to petition for a peace plan that would have led to the true and permanent separation of the US into two different countries. Lastly, by obtaining a major victory in the North, Lee and Davis hoped to draw attention to their cause from external sources. More specifically, the French were close to lending support for the Confederates, and a major victory in the North may well have been enough to encourage the French to throw their gauntlet into the ring. If that had happened, then the French navy would have been able to help relieve the blockades that had been set up by the Northern navy. This in turn would have allowed the Confederates to start receiving supplies from other sources. The South had reached a point where they recognized that their chances were rapidly diminishing. After losing at Gettysburg, their fate was sealed and it became just a matter of time before the inevitable happened. From that point on, they were mostly hoping to outlast the North. They didn't have the resources or manpower to launch any more offensives, so they could only hope that time would allow them to persuade other foreign powers to come to their aid. I had some assistance from this source, but most of my answer is based on extensive reading on the American Civil War. 

A translation of the Latin can be found here: $URL$ So if we estimate 500 dead at York, 300 dead in London in 1278, conservatively 100 at London in 1289, and perhaps another 100 dead in various other events, we could make a rough estimate of perhaps 33% of English Jews killed in the decades before the expulsion in 1290. Of course your question was "In England, was the Jewish population drastically reduced when these persecutions ended?" The answer is 'yes' because 100% of remaining Jews were removed from England by expulsion in 1290. However if you mean how many were killed during the persecutions, then between 20% and 40% looks like a realistic figure. 

The word 'Galldachd' for the lowlands arises from the Old Irish 'gall' for 'foreigner' which came in turn from the Latin word 'gallus' for a Gaul. $URL$ The Gaels called (indeed call) their linguistically and culturally Gaelic part of Scotland the Gàidhealtachd, usually translated as 'Gaeldom'. This cultural way of viewing the world gives a hint to what the Gaels meant when they said 'foreigners' ... they basically meant 'land of the non Gaels'. 'Foreigners' was not meant necessarily as any sort of denigration - it was just a simple statement of cultural and linguistic fact. The Irish word 'galldacht' has a closely related sense (although not identical) of the English, English speakers and the region of the Irish Pale, and therefore 'Galldachd' also had or came to have a sense of 'a region that is culturally English' - again meant as a simple reflection of the shared language and culture of lowland Scotland and England at that time, and not as any kind of denigration or diminution of Scottishness. In the years when these terms developed, there was no nation of Scotland, and Gaelic Scotland had little in common with the part of modern Scotland where people spoke the precursor dialects of Middle Scots. Even after the political entity of Scotland came into existence, the highlands and islands remained strongly distinct, and weakly controlled by the lowland Scots monarchy. A long tradition of antipathy between the two cultural regions meant that there would have been little motivation to ever stop calling the lowlands by a word that tended to underline the separation between the peoples. 

It's possible. It's extremely unlikely. There's no evidence for it, therefore as far as modern historians can be concerned, it didn't happen.
