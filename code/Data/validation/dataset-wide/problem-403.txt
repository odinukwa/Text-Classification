It is not very convenient to include several different ways to produce chemical energy into one organism. On the cellular level, this will entail different metabolic pathways, that may even intervene each other. Better to focus on one method and streamline that one. Furthermore, your algae (almost) already exists: Brown algae have the fastest linear growth of any organism on this plant. The record holder is M. pyrifera. Unfortunately they are restricted to shallow waters as they need to attach to bottom substrate. However, there are Sargassum species, which have a complete free-floating (=pelagic) life cycle: for example S. natans. The goal for your scientist is now to alter the Sargassum species to inherit the insane growth rates of M. pyrifera! And just like that you have a super-growing algae that you can grow without further restrictions in any water tank. These species reproduce only by fragmentation, so no need to be scared about spore contamination. Even without genetically growth enhancement the Sargassum algae today produces crazy amounts of biomass, look at this article: $URL$ PS: If you don't want to grow them in tanks, why not manufacture a huge ocean gyre that traps your enhanced Sargassum in one place, building a huge natural Sargassum farm? Oh wait... 

This seems to me the more difficult part. Negligibly senescent humans are a dream of distant future. However, you might want to read up on the wikipedia article about research strategies to neglect age-related damage to human tissue. From the article, you see that DNA mutations, junk protein, cell loss, loss of cell division capability and changes in cell linking protein all contribute to ageing in humans. Cancer and degenerative diseases are common consequences. Summary: In my opinion, the human anatomy is already quite close to that of Thor and the way to get there is theoretically known. However, to reach the desired age, several profound advances in different fields of medicine and biotechnology that are currently far from reality, have to be achieved. 

It's hard to imagine entities like the European Union to found a new nation, because it would rather want to integrate than to split up but I guess if they wanted to it would rather choose a bureaucratic approach maybe with an acronym. Something like: 

Aristocracy = Form of government which places power in the hands of a small, privileged ruling class. It's contrasted with democracy or monarchy. Post-scarcity society = I take it here, that you mean, that all usual needs are more of less fullfilled (and guaranteed). Materially, all inhabitants of your world, are equipped very similar. (Otherwise there would be some scarcity.) This means, there is no tangible privileged class really. There cannot be. If nothing is scarce, everyone can have everything. What government will this society have and why? You didn't say anything about it. Will it be a democracy? Or a tyranny? Or what will be it be? Will there be wars maybe? What about nations? From the definitions above you see that aristocracy is a form of government and post-scarcity is a technological, resource, infrastructure thing. Both seems to be pretty independent from each other. My guess: People will still favor certain other people based on family ties, appearance (color of skin for example), manner of speaking, ... and depending on the political system this will results in different groups which even in a democracy would fight against each other. The majority party could oppress the minority. One way (the most direct) to oppress someone might be to threaten to kill him if he disobeys. Or does post-scarcity mean that you cannot kill anyone? 

In countries and pre-modern societies where you have a high degree of inbreeding, this usually results in clannishness, nepotism and corruption, which is not a favorable condition for Western style democracies. Basically, extended inbred families at a higher level of common family ties, leads to the formation of "clans" and "clans" in turn have yet more remote family ties as "tribes". Most people in Iraq, for example, have a clan or tribal affiliation which often is more important to them than their national identity to a multi-ethnic state created by European diplomats a mere century ago. Above tribes are full fledged cultural communities (e.g. in Iraq: Kurds, Shiites, Arab Sunnis, Turkmen, and several smaller communities like Yazidis) some of which have internal extended family-clan-tribal substructure. Similar situations have arisen in post-colonial states in Africa and Southeast Asia. For example, it is a serious barrier to unity in the newly formed state of South Sudan. Part of the problem, well illustrated by the Iraqi case, is that by raw numbers since factions have different sizes, one of the national factions will always win and get a majority in parliament and lord over everyone else, while everyone else will always lose. In Iraq, the numbers are such that the Iraqi Shiites always win (upsetting the previous totalitarian regime in which the minority Arab Sunnis ruled knowing that their lack of a majority requires them to defer to the wishes of other ethnic groups; something similar is the case in Assad's Syria). Since movement between factions is more or less hereditary rather than fluid, this means that a substantial share of the population and majorities in large parts of the national territory, will always be on the losing side of every election. This makes democracy seem like a sham system not worth adopting to the perennial losers. They may as well be denied the franchise entirely. @Platypus adequately addresses the more or less consensus conclusion of the literature on that point. But, when no one clan is in a position to dominate the others, the most democratic (or at least most responsive to the opinion of the governed) alternative systems of government that arise are typically one of two kinds. Neo-Feudal Meritocracy An Example From Afghanistan One example is noted by David Anthony in his book "The Horse, The Wheel and Language" involving migration of people from Pashtun people who had a democracy of equal landowners in the jurga of Afghanistan to the neo-feudal society of the people in the neighboring mountains. Since you standing as a citizen and in the community among the Pashtun was dependent upon owning land, if you lost all of your land for some reason you joined a social underclass and had no future prospects. In contrast, in the neighboring mountain community, everyone was a liege of someone else (even the "king" of the region who was a liege of a leader of someone in Khazikstan), so there was no shame in being subordinate so someone else, and the system was fluid enough that if you showed promise, you could cast your allegiance with a more powerful master and move up in society without actually owning land. While not a true democracy, the neo-feudal mountain society did consider the views of underlings far down the power structure and promoted them if they had merit much as soldiers in the military might be promoted to higher office. A neo-feudal meritocracy can work in a clannish and inbred society. Other Examples If clan leaders are part of the overall feudal structure and the lord to which they all owe allegiance is distant and does not actively impose much order on the clan leaders, a cooperative council of clan leaders can result. This kind of dynamic is what gave rise to the House of Lords in the U.K. This neo-feudal meritocracy also characterizes the power structure and succession in the clannish society of Saudi Arabia, which is much more fluid than European feudal systems because the status of subordinates is frequently altered based upon merit from year to year, and in the system of Papal Succession within the Roman Catholic church. For what it is worth, this is also more or less how student organizations like clubs and student councils work in Japan, and how U.S. business corporations, universities and the U.S. military are organized. Again, it isn't democracy, but it is a system where there is room for advancement and where the quality opinions of people at the bottom can receive recognition and advance. It is a middle ground between absolute monarchy on strict hereditary principle applied at all levels of the organization as in Medieval Europe, and a free rule of law capitalist or democratic system. A Democratic Oligarchy Of Clan Or Faction Leaders Modern Examples Another example is that many clannish societies have a council of top clan leaders who jointly make policy for the entire clan society. For example, in Lebanon, there has been an arrangement for each of three top positions in the government to be allocated to a different religious faction (Muslim, Druze, Christian), so that each faction has a meaningful say in how the top level political decisions are made. Malaysia has a residual council of kings that collectively serve the role of a constitutional monarch with similar origins. One can look at the rotating presidency of the European Union as another example of what a political system on that basis can look like. Historical Examples Similar structures have existed historically, at times, in alliances within the Aegean Sea when it was balkanized into city-states, and among the Scottish clans. Many of the city-states of late medieval or early modern Europe were run on this basis with city council seats based down on a hereditary basis and divided among the leading families of the community as a previously more democratic system ossified into democratic oligarchy. In North America, the Iroquois Confederacy had this character. In The Bible While it is a bit hard to discern, the political system of the Hebrews described in the Hebrew Bible books of Exodus, Numbers, Joshua and Judges in which there were twelve tribes of Israel that met as councils when necessary to govern the overall community, and appointed temporary war leaders to lead them when necessary (called "judges") prior to the creation of the kingdoms of Judea and Israel, also reflect that kind of clan level democracy. In Fiction In fiction, a good example of this is the political structure of the living vampires explained in the later installments of the Vampire Academy series by Rachel Mead where governance is by a council of a dozen or so families led by a king chosen among them by a vote of the clan leaders. Another exploration of that kind of political system can be found in the Merchant Prince series by Charles Stross. You also see it in the structure of Werewolf society (by clan) and of other types of supernaturals (in family run "cabals") in Kelley Armstrong's Otherworld series. Vestigial Forms Of Clan Leader Democracy In North American Political Systems The U.S. Constitution is a hybrid of a democracy that gives each citizen with the franchise a roughly equal say (though the House of Representatives) and one that gives each collective group regardless of population a say (particularly before the adoption of the 17th Amendment when Senators were appointed rather than elected). The Confederation of the American colonies that existed from 1776-1789 before the current U.S. Constitution was enacted, was likewise based on a democracy of groups of people, rather than of individuals basis. In Canadian politics, councils of provincial premiers together with the prime minister to address issues of federalism, particularly where the provinces has some formal role but unity is desirable, have made what on paper seems like a relatively unitary political system work out in practice to be more of a hybrid system than the formal constitution would suggest. 

They can never be sure about that. After all what are the chances that there is another solar system with some planets and a brighter sun and no artificial traces of a past civilization, totally different star patterns and cat-like species (as you describe it). It could be that in one of the hundreds of millions other stars in one of the million other galaxies this will be the case in 600 million years. Getting the time right might not be a problem, we measure the age of the universe already now (with some error) as 13.8 billion years, so maybe it could then be measured again as 14.4 billion years. But being certain about the location, that would require some statistical estimation of how unique our solar system is currently, how quickly that changes and then how significant the reasoning is that if you see certain species and fossils that it can only have been earth. It all depends on how unique we are and we don't know that. The best idea would probably to colonize the new planet and then spread out to find something that resembles the original earth more. If you don't find anything, you can still think you are on the original earth, but you may not be sure about it. In principle if we map enough stars and galaxies and have precise enough informations about their evolutions for the next 600 billion years we might have enough evidence to conclude we are still on earth, but I doubt that. 

A poison typically works independent on whether you know about it or not. If it shall only work if you know about it, it would have to be able to literally read the mind (nocebo effects or cheating by faking the poisoning and then waiting for the person to make a mistake are not very specific and might easily fail). The usual chemical compounds cannot do that, so either you have to use advanced technology (like the nanorobots of Anders Gustafsons answer) or magic. A magical solution could for example be: 

The real problem with a plant triggering sexual arousal is that even if the plant does successfully achieve this perfectly, in some way or another, leveraging that cue into an attempt to have sex with the plant that in turn causes the plant to be able to eat you is an entirely different matter. Sexual arousal merely makes someone highly receptive to other perhaps otherwise substandard cues that there is an opportunity to have sex (the technical term is beer goggles). Someone really aroused and far gone might even try to copulate with a dog or a cow or a goat. But, even extremely sexually aroused drunk people do not generally try to copulate with plants. A plant that did this might cause animals in its vicinity to have inter-species and other varieties of sex that they might not otherwise engage in, like certain plants in the Xanth novels of Piers Anthony, but would probably not lead to someone trying to have sex with the plant itself. Changing the cues in other senses that cause a person's brain to identify a potential sexual partner to the extent that they would be attracted to a plant when they were sexually aroused would be far, far harder (maybe virtually impossible) than merely causing someone to be sexually aroused in general. A more plausible strategy for a plant that could tap into the biochemical pathway that leads to sexual arousal would be to have a chemical trigger that has that effect when ingested, causing people to eat the plant to get the effect and in the process to spread the seeds and encourage humans to cultivate them. 

The easiest way by far is creating unrest, acting unfair, opressing independent minds, favoring a particular subpopulation without good reason, .... And then, when unrest boils over, send in the mighty army (you had to) to keep the peace (killing some along the lines and getting lots of real life training "for free"). A tyranny with an emporer on top might be a good political framework for this kind. Nobody needs to know that the leaders of the freedom fighters are secret agents of the government and that the outdated weapons they use came from the government too. One rebellion every 10 years in some part of the world that is then suppressed bloodily by the army should be doable. 

For all we know: Yes. I shamelessly copy from two comments below the question by user6760 and bon. For the birth gravitation is usually helpful in assisting the pushing force of the contractions. Many women stand or sit during the birth. However, it is conceivable that even without gravitation there is enough force to push the baby out of the uterus. In the same way one could also help and create artificial pull by applying a suction cup to the head of the baby and pull. Or one could apply a C-section which would eliminate the need for gravitation at all during birth. Rotating elements creating artificial gravitation similar to our gravitation level are feasible. During infinite space travel you don't have to do without gravitation. In the absence of friction with the surrounding space, such a rotation could be maintained very efficiently. Centrifugal forces are exactly the same as gravitational forces. Regarding the endurance of the construction towards rotation, please note that space vehicles have to endure a multiple of that force during launch and they do. An infinitely traveling human space race surely would replace weak parts over time with newer parts to hold it all together. And even if for most of the time you would life in low-G environments, by doing sports in this environment (pushing against each other, ...) one could keep the muscles trained. For the skeleton it may indeed by bad in the long run. We don't have reliable long term information about that. The human race living in low-G might indeed evolve different (less upright). Maybe modern medicine (the technology of today to tomorrow) could strengthen the bones artificially (increased calcium uptake,...).
