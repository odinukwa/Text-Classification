So they significantly predicted them and some of the correlations were quite large (.84 for optimism). Some correlations weren't significant, so this is of course not in the realm of "there was practically no difference" (quoting you), but it's also a different study. This wasn't such a small sample to begin with (13 teachers, 8-20 students per class, so at least 104) and they varied it too (thinner slices, predicting principal's ratings of high school teachers). The paradigm is used quite often in different variations nowadays. You actually asked about a different study, so I didn't go in very deeply. Maybe you think my answer strays too far from the original question. Question two "Are first impressions a surprisingly good judge of character?": Yes, this step has been taken, but I wouldn't call it surprisingly good. Peer ratings, even by friends, aren't usually highly correlated with self-reported personality. There is a classic meta-analysis about thin slices by Ambady & Rosenthal (1992). They found no increase in accuracy of predictions of various objective outcomes after half a minute (to 5 minutes). It's contradicted Carney, Colvin, & Hall (2007) who found that accuracy increased with exposure time, which they varied from 5s to 5min (peak for extraversion after 5 min clip .55). Extraversion after 20 seconds was .41 correlated with self-report. I don't know if you consider this "surprisingly good". The results are different for less obvious traits (openness). Are first impressions unchangeable? Srivastava, Guglielmo, & Beer (2010) (great names, simply great names) found that stability of perceiver effects (peer ratings in students) increases over time. Across the Big Five: Week 1-2: .37; Week 2-3: .55, Week 3-4: .65. So, they are certainly not unchangeable. 

As was suggested in the comment to the above answer, the premise "Clearly fats increase the amount of cholesterol in our blood" is not all that clear when you look at the literature. I'm hesitant to make this answer on a skeptics site, because ... well ... you should be skeptical when someone challenges such a long held scientific consensus. Before beginning "Plasma lipid and lipoprotein responses to dietary fat and cholesterol: a meta-analysis" in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (1997) [ref] is a meta-analysis supporting the idea that we should be skeptical of the OP's claim. It points out that because of the biochemistry of the body, how much cholesterol we eat has little effect on the amount in the blood (more on this later): 

I imagine properly testing it would be a very big project (i.e. you'd have to have to rule out a lot of alternatives and ideally do it longitudinally with actual behaviour) I can easily imagine how such an idea would come about, because people who have such laugh lines may appear more friendly (misinterpretation of wrinkles as facial expression) which leads observers to reconstruct that they must have smiled a lot. 

Maybe you want to go through their references and those who cite them, if you care about this research area. 

Maybe you'd like to read this, in a way it's a case study of what you're asking about. I think it counts a little more than an anecdote, because it's systematically done, but it's just one issue of course. Block (1995) describes how the publication of "The Bell Curve" by Herrnstein and Murray in 1994 shifted debate, so suddenly they were discussing "the degree of blacks' genetic inferiority" when it comes to IQ, when before it wouldn't have been okay to assert any genetic inferiority at all. 

Bengal was only created 70 years ago and, given the arbitrariness of international borders, the fact that the Rohingya speak a different dialect isn't proof that they're a different "nationality", nor that they are recent illegal immigrants. IOW this may be a continuation of ethnic partitioning of which the partition of Bengal was one example, the partition of India another, the Bosnian war another, and so on -- see ethnic cleansing. Or from the Guardian: 

It's a model or approximation: which can be applied, more or less usefully, to some (a subset of) things. It's supported by, for example: 

Or this definition which says that by the 5th century the word means "témérité" (i.e. impertinence, audacity, cheek). That's similar to the second of Google's definitions of the English word, 

Her evidence to the contrary wasn't published in peer reviewed journals, so if somebody has something stronger, better pay attention to that instead. From the abstract of her dissertation: 

What does this say? Well, it doesn't really give a hint for a causal relationship in either direction. You can't (ethically and practically) do experimental random pairings of high school students, so the best we could hope for is natural experiments (looking at the time-lagged effects of getting in a relationship). Neyer & Asendorpf did that and found stable increases in conscientiousness and decreases in neuroticism (both of which could be good for academic performance). N&A had a student sample and they didn't assess academic performance, but I wanted to show an example of the research design, that would provide the best possible evidence. 

Reading this list, assuming it's complete, shows that it's true that there are no Federal laws which condemn cruelty to farm animals before they are taken for slaughter: which includes all animals which will not enter the human food chain (e.g. because they are too sick).

He is a former biochemist, not a physicist. The video excerpt which is cited in the OP references a book titled Entangled Minds whose blurbs (i.e. promotional reviews) are not written by physicists. The first blurb is by Deepak Chopra who at timeline 3:10 in this video says that physicists have "somehow hijacked the word for their own use". IMO the term "quantum", as and when it is used by 'these people', doesn't have the same meaning as when it's used by most physicists and/or applied mathematicians. I accept that this answer of mine is "ad hominem": i.e. it concentrates on the people more than on the argument. On the other hand, if you're looking for "peer-reviewed" literature, this answer may be useful to you, in that identifies who they regard as they own peers. 

As far as I know Botox works by paralysing the facial muscles whose activity causes wrinkles so I think it's somewhat plausible. 

I think this is a large effect (did I do the math right? are those CIs or SDs?), but it's a small sample. They didn't detect any bad "hard" outcomes (lower performance, more lapses, more sleepiness), but this might be a power problem. But then again, this one night didn't press levels down to anything anormal. Also, sleep efficiency is not the best measure of sleep quality (polysomnographs give better estimates of NREM sleep, stage changes, etc.). Essentially they did what you had in mind already, right? But it was just one night and they call for longer tests (I have access to the full text, but I probably am not allowed to send it to you?!). From their conclusion: 

There are many more, but we'll end here because this is already too long. My answer to the question is No! Excessive intake of butter would probably not result in a heart attack at all, yet alone before the age of 21. 

Thus I don't plan to convince anyone that the consensus is wrong, because this would take thousands of pages of going through every single study on this issue. Instead, I'll give you a starting point to see that eating (saturated) fat does not seem to add (negatively) to the amount of cholesterol in the blood. There seems to be three main sources one could be getting this information from: large scale observational epidemiological studies claiming a correlation, basic theory of biochemistry, and controlled studies attempting to identify a causal relation. The book Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Taubes spends hundreds of pages examining what all the main large scale observational studies claim. These include studies (but are not limited to) such as the Framingham Nurses Study or MRFIT. There are problems with whether or not correlations are significant, meaningful, causal. There are more confounding variables than imaginable. In general, you just can't use the weak correlations found in these studies to draw any conclusions. You need something better. The most persuasive argument should come from biochemistry itself. If we know some biological pathway, then we are essentially done. Peter Attia has done a huge series on what cholesterol is, whether or not it is bad, and how it gets in our bodies. Here we run into a subtlety. In the original assumption it is unclear whether the poster thinks that eating fat causes an increase in blood cholesterol because you are eating saturated fat or because you are eating cholesterol. Most cholesterol we eat can't be absorbed to the blood stream because it is in esterified form (it is too large to be absorbed). Most cholesterol in our body is made inside the body (Attia cites "New insights into the genetic regulation of intestinal cholesterol absorption" published in Gastroenterology (2005) [ref]). Attia makes his point as follows:

In some countries, the term "spousal abuse" isn't limited to physical violence. For example according to this Canadian government definition it includes: 

Anecdotes aren't worth as much as cohort studies; when you have 200,000+ people taking a drug there are going to be some scary stories. The cohort study says it's safe (at least regarding depression etc.) It's less dangerous than smoking 

Another example is at In Creation God Calls the World into Existence from Nothingness by John Paul II in 1986, which reads like a sermon about Genesis. In it, the Pope says, 

Even basic texts such as Lehninger's Principles of Biochemistry contain how this "de novo" cholesterol production works (5th edition, pg 838) and points out that "Excess carbohydrate in the diet can also be converted to triacylglycerols in the liver and exported as VLDLs" (carbs not fat!) which as a later part of the series by Attia points out is actually a better predictor for cardiovascular disease. Just a word on eating fat. On p35 of The Great Cholesterol Con, Kendrick says: “How can eating saturated fat raise LDL levels? It is not merely biologically implausible, it is biologically impossible." Maybe this is an fallacious argument from authority, but hold off judgment until after the next paragraph. Moving on to specific studies. Supposing that eating lots of saturated fat causes a worse cholesterol profile it would be essentially impossible to observe results such as in "Comparison of the Atkins, Zone, Ornish, and LEARN Diets for Change in Weight and Related Risk Factors Among Overweight Premenopausal Women The A TO Z Weight Loss Study: A Randomized Trial" published in JAMA (2007) [ref] (colloquially called "A TO Z"). The study found that the higher fat diet the participants ate, the better their heart risk lipid profile got. Essentially every study of this kind observes the same trend, and really points to the lack of a link between dietary fat and ("bad") cholesterol. The authors say:

I have linked to a French translation because I don't read Spanish. The French and Dutch were partisan/biased against the Spanish, and the original author (Bartolomé de las Casas) had a religious or political agenda in writing this account, but I have no great reason to doubt their veracity. More importantly I think that Bartolomé de las Casas is an origin of the claims in the OP. The Oatmeal article says,
