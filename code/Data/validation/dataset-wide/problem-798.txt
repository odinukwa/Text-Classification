Intro for the uninformed: A standard candle is an important concept in astronomy, helping to map out distances in the Universe. Since the observed flux $F$ of a light source decreases with distance $r$ by a known factor ($r^2$), if we know its intrinsic luminosity L, we can calculate the distance. For large distances, where bright sources are needed, we usually use supernovae (SNe). But the luminosity of a SN depends on the mass of its progenitor star which is not known in general. However, for a specific type of SNe — "type Ia" — it is known: This type are SNe that explode when a white dwarf accreting mass from a companion star exceed the mass threshold for explosion of $1.4\,M_\odot$. 

Usually, in an N-body or SPH simulation the term "mass resolution" refers to the mass of a single particle, which usually all have the same mass. A single particle can always be "detected" in the simulation, since we have control of the coordinates of all particles, but a structure of several particles becomes ill-defined if the number of particles is too small The mass of the smallest resolved structure depends on your definition of "resolved". That could be, say, 10 or 100 particles, depending on what quantity you are interested in measuring, and how accurately you want it. For instance, to define the mass of the structure, you need to be able to count the number of particles in the structure. But how does one know where to stop counting in a more or less continuous field of particles? One way is to determine an approximate center of mass $x_\mathrm{CM}$ (approximate, since it can only be exact once all associated particles are defined), calculate the average density $\langle\rho\rangle$ inside a sphere centered on $x_\mathrm{CM}$ (which will be higher than the global average, since you started out on an overdensity), and increase the radius until $\langle\rho\rangle$ falls below some threshold (e.g. 200 times the global average). If the number of particles is too small, $\langle\rho\rangle$ will change a lot between each iteration, making your mass inaccurate. I think for this purpose, at least ten particles are needed. If you're interested in the structure of the interstellar medium in a galaxy in a hydrodynamic (i.e. SPH) simulation, you probably need more particles than this. But I thinks it's fair to say that people disagree on how many particles are needed to resolve a galaxy. 

Aganju's answer is excellent, but I'd like to add one thing: The radius used is Earth's radius, which is applicable if you're at the equator. At higher latitudes, the effective radius is smaller by a factor $\cos\theta$, where $\theta$ is the latitude in radians. For iMerchant, who seem to be located in Vancouver at $$\theta = 49.3^{\circ}\times\pi/180 = 0.86\,\mathrm{rad},$$ the relevant radius is $$ R_\mathrm{eff} = R_\oplus\cos\theta = 4150\,\mathrm{km}, $$ so at the $T=1.4\,\mathrm{h}$ of Aganju's answer (1.5 h is just a little too slow), the centrifugal (or -petal, if you prefer) acceleration would be only $g_\mathrm{spin} = 6.5\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}$. Moreover, whereas Earth's acceleration is directed toward the center of Earth, in Vancouver the centrifugal acceleration would be directed at an angle $\theta$ toward South. Thus, only a component $g_\mathrm{spin} \cos\theta = 4.2\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}$ would point upward. This is not enough to send iMerchant into space. However, a component $g_\mathrm{spin} \sin\theta = 4.9\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, or roughly half a G, would point horizontally toward South, enough to send him tumbling down the street, or at least walk awkwardly. 

The figure below shows the evolution of the Hubble parameter $H$ from 10 billion years (Gyr) ago, to 10 Gyr into the future: 

Some of your questions seem to be genuine enough, so I'll address those: When the CMB was emitted, it was emitted everywhere in the Universe, in all directions. That means that we see it at all times, but the part that we see at a given time comes from an ever-increasing distance. Today that distance is roughly 47 billion lightyears (Gly). It is also redshifted, today by a factor of $z \simeq 1100$. That means that when it was emitted, the Universe was a factor 1100 smaller (in all three directions). Hence, that particular part of the Universe that emitted the light that we see today was $47\,\mathrm{Gly} \,/\, 1100 \simeq 43 \,\mathrm{Mly}$. Since the CMB is observed from all directions, only light from small patches on the sky can be regarded as being parallel. Obviously light from the left of you and above you is not parallel. The CMB hasn't really been "right on our heels" since it was emitted, any more than, say, the cars overtaking you when you riding your bike are right on your heels. You're just constantly being overtaken by new CMB photons. The part we see today was actually carried away from us by expansion for the first 4 billion years or so, before it overtook expansion and started reducing its distance from us. Inflation, as James Kilfiger comments, is something completely unrelated, taking place when the Universe was some $10^{-33}$ s old, as opposed to the CMB which was emitted when the Universe was 380,000 years old. 

Observe an average number density of galaxies (which of course varies quite a lot from dense clusters to voids). Calculate the size of the Universe by integrating the Friedmann equation (using as input observed values of the densities of the constituents of the Universe; dark energy, dark matter, gas, stars, radiation, etc.). Finally, multiply the two numbers to get the total number. 

tl;dr: Your field of view would cover roughly one square centimeter of the sky at that time, and you would observe roughly 50 billionths of the observable Universe. 

As you know, but other readers maybe don't, on Earth the sunlight is scattered by Rayleigh scattering on the molecules of the atmosphere. This has quite a strong wavelength dependence, with blue light being scattered much more efficiently than red light. On Mars, there is almost no atmosphere. Instead, the Sun's light is scattered by the fine, red dust swirled up in the (thin) air. In the visible spectrum, the scattering properties of this dust happens to have an opposite wavelength dependence than that of the Earth's atmosphere, with a rather low scattering cross section in the blue, rising steeply toward longer wavelengths (e.g. Ockert-Bell et al. 1997). Thus, the red light is scattered over the Martian sky, creating a red sky, while the blue light passes almost unhindered through, giving the blue Sun. In addition, the asymmetry parameter of the dust is rather large, meaning that the blue light that is scattered has a preference for being scattered in the forward direction, i.e. toward the observer of the sunset (e.g. Vincendon et al. 2007). This creates a blue halo around the Sun as it sets. 

$^\dagger$In astronomy, the term "metal", refers to all elements that are not hydrogen or helium, and "metallicity" is the fraction of gas that consists of metals. 

Yes, and indeed it did. For some stars. Some first stars were close to us, some were far away. The light from the ones that were very far away has yet to reach us, while the light from the ones that were close to us, reached us in the past; if we look today at their location, we no longer see first stars, but instead see evolved galaxies. On the other hand, the light from the ones that happened to lie at the particular distance of roughly 2.7 billion lightyears (Gly) when the Universe was 400 Myr old reaches us today. An example of this is the galaxy GN-z11. "2.7 Gly?", you say, "Shouldn't that light have reached us after 2.7 Gyr, then?" No, because the Universe expands, it takes longer. In fact at that time, the part of the Universe that was at the distance of GN-z11 expanded at four times the speed of light. That means that even though light traveled in our direction (locally at the speed of light), the distance from us$^\dagger$ to the photons increased. Eventually, however, as the photons reached regions that expanded less rapidly, they "overtook" the expansion of the Universe, and slowly started decreasing their distance to us. 

Right: The HII region NGC 604 (from Wikipedia). Left: The spectra of three different stars. Only the B star has a significant portion of its spectrum above the hydrogen ionization threshold. Note the logarithmic scale on the intensity (from here). Because of the high densities, the HII quickly recombines to HI. If the recombination goes directly to the ground state, a new ionizing photon is emitted, which again is absorbed by a hydrogen atom, but if it goes to one of the higher states, the emitted radiation is no longer capable of ionizing the gas. In this way the ionizing radiation is converted into photons of specific wavelengths, corresponding the energy differences between the excited level of hydrogen, most notably the Lyman $\alpha$ emission line with $\lambda = 1216$ Å. Because hydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe, and because Lyman $\alpha$ is the most common transition, the Lyman $\alpha$ line is an excellent probe of the most distant galaxies where other wavelengths are not observable. This is especially so because the most distant galaxies are also the earliest and hence still in the process of forming, meaning a high star formation rate which, in turn, means that the shortlived OB stars are still present. In addition to this distinct regions of HII, ionized hydrogen also exist in a more diffuse component between the stars of a galaxy, in huge bubbles caused by stellar feedback and supernovae, and in the intergalactic medium. $^\dagger$The terms HI and HII refers to neutral and ionized hydrogen, respectively. 

As you can see, the change in $H$ is modest nowadays, compared to the past. The "acceleration" of the expansion at any point in time is given by the tangent to the curve at that time. Today, the change is $dH/dt \simeq -1.2\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$, or roughly $-10^{-17}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In other words, it will take roughly a billion years before the expansion rate has decreased by $1\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and it asymptotically approaches some $57\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Since $H$ is defined as $(da/dt)\,/\,a$, where $a$ is the scale factor (the "size" of the Universe), a constant $H$ implies that $a\propto e^{Ht}$; that is, the size of the Universe increases exponentially. 

Even "round" galaxies look different from stars cphyc's answers the question excellently: Spectroscopy is the answer, although since — as explained below — galaxies are not point sources, the morphology of stars and galaxies is also different: even elliptical galaxies observed along one of their axes look different from stars. Although both are round, the way that their light falls off radially is different; stars' light decrease roughly as a normal distribution from the center and out (with some extra profile folded in which depends on the instrument), while the surface brightness profile of galaxies decrease in a somewhat more complicated fashion (e.g. a Sérsic profile). Can galaxies be point sources? Wrt. the fraction of galaxies that are point source, the answer is virtually none. Galaxies can almost always be resolved although, as cphyc also correctly says, not with any instrument. Radio and gamma-ray telescopes have very poor resolution, and at these wavelengths the sources usually cannot be resolved unless they're relatively nearby. But at optical wavelengths, as well as UV and IR, telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope and even good ground-based telescopes can resolve ~all galaxies, unless they're so small that they're too dim to be seen anyway. Angular diameter in an expanding Universe The reason is a rather peculiar feature of the expanding Universe: A galaxy will look smaller and smaller, the farther away it is (as expected from everyday life), but only out to a certain distance, after which they will appear larger and larger. Why is this so? Because light moves with a finite speed, we observe galaxies as they were in the past — the more distant, the longer time ago. And since in an expanding Universe, "long time ago" also means closer, the angle that a galaxy spans on the sky is the angle that it spanned when it emitted the light, not the angle it spans today. That is, very distant galaxies emitted the light we see today when they were so close that they spanned a large angle. The exact relation between distance and the solid angle of a galaxy depends on the cosmology (i.e. the values of density parameters, Hubble constant, etc.). For the latest Planck measurements (2015), a galaxy that is 1 kpc (~3000 lightyears) across — which would be considered a small galaxy — spans an angle given by this figure: 

The SMBHs reside in the bottom of the galactic potentials, which are dominated by the galaxies' dark matter halos. But although dark matter dominates gravity, collisions between gas and dust particles in the interstellar medium causes enough friction that the baryonic component of the galaxies is decelerated. This will cause the other components of the galaxies to decelerate as well, through gravitational attraction. Moreover, despite dark matter (and, in practice, stars and black holes since they're so small) being collisionless, there are several ways of "relaxing", i.e. to evolve towards an equilibrium. In the context of galaxy merging, the most important mechanism (I think) is "violent relaxation", where the rapid change of the gravitational potential causes particles to relax, e.g. more massive particles tend to transfer more energy to their lighter neighbors and so become more tightly bound, sinking towards the center of the gravitational potential. Although SMBHs are…, well, supermassive, the potential will (usually) be dominated by dark matter, gas, and stars, so the new gravitational potential will also cause the SMBHs to seek towards the bottom in the same fashion, and eventually merge. 

Yes, for a given galaxy type… The term "a distribution of number of galaxies per redshift interval" does make sense, but usally we restrict ourselves to a certain type of galaxies, e.g. Lyman $\alpha$ emitters, Lyman break galaxies, sub-mm galaxies, etc. The reason is that galaxies are detected in a number of different ways, and no single selection technique captures all types of galaxies. …and comoving volume… Because the Universe is expanding with time, the "true" (physical) number density of galaxies — and everything else (except dark energy) — decreases with time. To be able to compare densities at different times, it is useful to measure them in comoving coordinates, which is the coordinates that expand along with the Universe. In these coordinates, densities only change if some physical process happen. For instance, the physical energy density of photons decreases both because the volume of the Universe increases and because the photons redshift. In comoving coordinates it also decreases, but only due to the redshifting since the volume change is factored out. …and luminosity. Moreover, since galaxies have no well-defined lower size/mass/luminosity threshold, we have to define a threshold above which we count them. For this reason, rather than talking about "the number density of galaxies per redshift", we usually use the very useful observable luminosity function (LF) which measures the number of (a certain type of) galaxies per luminosity bin, and per comoving volume, at a given redshift. LFs have been probed out to very high redshifts, at the times when galaxies were just beginning to form at $\sim$half a gigayear after Big Bang (e.g. Schenker et al. 2013). You end your question by asking about the number of galaxies at $z\le0.01$, which would be considered very low redshift in the context of galaxies. You can find the answer by considering all kinds of selection criteria, checking for overlaps between surveys (most local galaxies will be detected by multiple techniques), and integrating over volume the LFs down to your chosen threshold (e.g. Small Magellanic Cloud-sized). Doable, but not trivial. An alternative is to integrate numerically calculated dark matter halo mass functions, using e.g. this online tool, and assuming the every halo hosts a galaxy. I get a number density of $n\sim0.4$ halos per $h^{-3}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{3}$, or $1.2\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The comoving volume out to $z=0.01$ is $V=3.3\times10^5$ Mpc, so the total number of (super-SMC-sized) galaxies is $N = n V \simeq 3.8\times10^5$.
