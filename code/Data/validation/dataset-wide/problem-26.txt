You don't want lead or other heavy shielding because the biggest danger in space is"particle" radiation, atoms moving at near light speed. When the particles hit heavy shielding they produce a ton of secondary radiation. However, PVC sheeting has shown promise in this application. See $URL$ . 

Moved from comment to answer because I've done more research. Try the biblical account of Sodom and Gomorrah, believed to be near the coast of the Dead Sea . The cities were destroyed by means of volcanism (fire and brimstone), and 4000 years later we still don't know where they are for sure. As an argument for the effectiveness of this approach, there is even debate as to whether the cities actually ever existed. The Dead Sea region is (in)famous for its sulfur (brimstone) smell. One of its names over the centuries was "The Stink Sea" because of it. While the region has been tectonically active in the past, there are no active volcanoes in the area in recent times. Igneous rocks are the norm around the dead sea, as are old volcanic craters. To achieve your ends using this example, you are looking for a pyroclastic volcanic event that has a sudden onset, creates pyroclastic projectiles sufficient to smash stone and clay homes to rubble, but does not have an associated lava flow or leave a new crater. It must maintain a temperature high enough to cremate bodies, but not so high as to fire the clay into ceramics, without deoxygenating the atmosphere for sufficient time to allow thorough cremation of the bodies. A short lived lava plume, which originally powered the eruption, sits beneath the two cities, raising their temperature for the duration of the event. This is distinctly different from pompei, where the environment was preserved by ashes and lava flow. Edit: Summary of some concerns raised in comments The veracity of the biblical account is not part of this discussion. For that, go to one of the religious (Christianity, Judaism, etc) or archaeology SE sites. This is not an attempt to prove that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by volcanic activity. It is an observation of a recorded event in a real location (Dead Sea valley) that matches the OP's question, and uses the real world geology of the area to establish a plausible natural event that a deity could use in the manner that OP requested. Setting aside the questions that are bigger than this discussion and off topic for worldbuilding, this event comes to mind because: 

So when I say everything, I mean everything. Humans, animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, all dead. If the bacteria and other detritovores and decomposers can't decompose anything since they themselves are all dead, what happens to all the carcasses and remains of the life? Do these remains decay through other inorganic means? What do they look like throughout this process? And how long would it take? (For the purposes of this question, let's just say that Viruses and Prions count as "alive", they are "killed" in this scenario as well) 

What I'm thinking for this question is that some kind of filter is put around the sun by aliens that prevents some kinds of solar energy from passing through but allows other types. Like if it stopped visible light but allowed UV. Is there any way that the parts of light plants need for photosynthesis can be separated from visible light, allowing the plants to survive but preventing visible light from passing through? I've tried to do my own research on this, but all I've found is that they require a nonspecific "light", and I'm not sure if this means specifically visible light or all kinds of light, such as UV. For the question, assume that the barrier around the Earth can sort between different types of light, regardless of whether or not this makes any sense. EDIT: Close voters, I understand my question may be slightly difficult to understand due to the nature of what I am asking, however reading the answers below should allow you to see what I am looking for, and show that there are others who understood the question even if you didn't. 

State-Sanctioned Divine Beings Short answer: No These divine beings aren't the church, the church is simply an organization that worships them. The beings themselves are separate entities, and as a result contracting them should have no legal implications in terms of separation of church and state. This only changes if the beings are a part of the leadership structure of the church itself. For example, if an Angel holds an official position of power in the church equivalent to a bishop or priest. Weaponized Priesthood Short answer: No, but only if they are being contracted like mercenary groups This part of the answer is a simple one. If they're being given specific contracts as if they were mercenaries, then this is no violation. This isn't a violation because they're never becoming a part of the state itself. If they are official government employees, however, then this is a violation. These are official parts of the church that are also official parts of the government, and this is a violation of church and state. However... As Daron's answer has indicated, there's no law that enforces a separation of church and state. This answer is more of a guide of things that are and aren't violating the concept of separation of Church and State, which while it might not be useful for the legal aspects of your world, might be useful for the societal impacts. 

If you have ever had to fight with lighting in a video studio, you will know the frustration that ensues because your eye is self adjusting for white balance. When you look at he scene in real life, whites are white. Look at it on the video monitor, and everything is red because of the tungsten lights. After an adjustment period (a few minutes to a few hours) your visitors would perceive colors exactly the same as a native. 

The blimp would have no buoyancy on Mars. Mars atmosphere would make a good attempt at a hard vacuum, at less than 1% the density of earth's. A blimp and a rock would have nearly the same flying ability. 

Yes it is possible. Take Italy, which is named in the Bible (Acts 27). There are 20,000 unpopulated ghost towns in a small heavily populated country that is over 2,000 years old. Link: $URL$ 

If they are surrounded by a refractive field that extends a fraction of an inch beyond their skin, then they could wear tight fitting clothes (spandex for example) and the field would cover them. They would not be able to wear arctic winter gear and maintain invisibility because that would require the refractive field to extend a couple of inches from their body. The refractive field would require significant initial amount of effort to establish, but thereafter would require only maintenance energy (comparable to a brisk walk). When the organs generating the refractive field are exhausted the refractive field would collapse and leave her visible. With training, as with any other physiological process, she can increase her limit through practice, nutrition, and rest. 

Biolumiscent algae or bacteria in the air can respond to moisture by lighting up. While I am not aware of any real airborne organisms that meet the criterion, the biochemistry is well understood and employed by aquatic micro organisms and macro organisms from all kingdoms and environments. 

Robert Zubrin talks a lot about this kind of problem in his book "The case for Mars". As other people have already noted, airplanes can operate at much higher altitudes than humans can. In real life, Mars' atmosphere is sufficiently sparse today that it would make a very creditable attempt at creating a hard vacuum in a laboratory here on Earth. While the storms kick up a lot of dust, you would hardly even feel them because the air pressure is so low. the major hazards they pose are visibility and dust contamination. Between its low gravity and low air pressure, the biggest part of Mars' attraction for development lies in the cheapness of transportation. Long distance travel by suborbital rocket is incredibly cheap compared to air travel on Earth. Travel to Earth's moon is actually cheaper from Mars than from Earth. If you thicken the atmosphere sufficiently to prevent explosive decompression, you lose the advantages that make Mars desirable. There are two approaches to building a low pressure environment suit. The first is the "bubble", which is how current generation space suits work. You seal the suit and then pressurize it with air to something tolerable by a human. The second approach is to use the suit fabric to apply mechanical pressure directly to the wearers skin. What you need is the latter, a mechanical counter pressure (MCP) suit. Robert Heinlein actually had some pretty good ideas about how a quasi "shirt sleeve" environment might work in his 1950's novel "Red Planet". While some of his ideas are definitely based on a faulty knowledge of Mars' true environment (canals, martians), his engineering skills were working at 100%. Reading the first chapter might give you some ideas. 

Let's say you have the entirety of Earth's nuclear stockpile at your disposal (you don't have to use it all, and if you need it there's an infinite supply of extra ICBMs) and that every weapon you fire will have 100% accuracy as to where it explodes. Is there any way these explosions could take place without causing any environmental (or at the very least Limited) damage to the planet's environment? I'd imagine the problems with this would be that the explosion would either be too high in space for the EMP to affect anything, or too low in the Atmosphere to not cause damage. Am I correct in this, or is a (mostly) worldwide nuclear EMP feasible without causing mass environmental damage? 

You've got a space gun. There's no doubt this idea could work, as the article I linked will tell you. So essentially yes, this contraption of yours is entirely possible (as for whether or not you can use a Space Gun to launch a projectile unnoticed into space, well that might be a good idea to ask in another question, since that seems right up this site's alley) 

TL;DR: What tactics can a professionally trained army use against a horde of untrained conscripts using human wave attacks? (This scenario takes place in the very-near future.) Background information: The two forces of SEDA and GAU have been at war for the past decade, SEDA defending against the constant onslaught of GAU conscripts. Brainwashed and forced into service with minimal training and faulty equipment, the armies of GAU are nothing more than hordes of conscripts rushing blindly at the enemy (in a similar method to the Banzai Charges of WW2.) In modern history, human wave attacks have often failed and have only served to waste entire battalions by having them be cut down by machine-gun fire. However, the size of the GAU forces have the sheer excess of numbers to make this a viable strategy. They are vastly more numerous than their opponents, overwhelming their enemies with sheer numbers. The forces of SEDA are professionally trained and equipped soldiers, defending against the hordes of conscripts. While in normal scenarios this alone would be enough to counter such an unorganized attack, the sheer numbers of their enemy calls for a more specialized counter-strategy. What Tactics and Strategies can SEDA use to defend against this human wave attack style? Are there any formations or positioning that could help them gain an advantage? 

Short answer: the pancreas can't do it, no matter how much chitin it produces. Chitin is laid down in place, not circulated. Pancreatic chitin would not do the job because (best case) it would protect the pancreas, which is tiny and already buried deeply within the abdomen behind layers of intestine, from attacks that would be somewhat inconvenient (say the spear glances off the pancreas and penetrates the aorta and/or several sections of intestine) whether or not the pancreas itself was actually hit. 

It has been done. This chain discusses some of the past experiments: $URL$ RPG7 uses a peizo electric primer, and Remington had a peizo electric primed cartridge for its 700 series, but the ammunition was cost prohibitive. $URL$ 

Temperature in the cities must reach 900 degrees C to guarantee complete incineration of organic remains, but must not exceed 1200 degrees C or there would be glazes and ceramic remains of the buildings. Heat as low as 600 degrees C can do the job given enough time, but 900 degrees guarantees cremation in about an hour. The oxygen levels in the affected area must remain high enough to allow for combustion of organics. There can be no significant ash fall. The buildings must be broken apart to leave no clues. Heat alone will not do this, but bombardment with pyroclastic rocks would do so. Said rocks would blend into the background of the igneous rubble and clays native to the area (from which the buildings were originally constructed). A new crater cannot be formed, since that would leave clues. An event the scale of Mount St. Helens would leave traces all over the continent. Fortunately, there are plenty of old craters in the Dead Sea valley to use for this purpose. 

A warm front and cold front meet, and the warm mass of air is lifted by the cold mass of air. Precipitation that would normally counter the updraft is blown horizontally by shear winds, so the updraft above has nothing to limit its strength. Shear winds of different strengths start to form tubes around the updraft The Tubes formed in step 2 are absorbed into the updraft where they start a general rotation and become a supercell. The supercell tube stretches. As surrounding air moves in to replace what is lifted by the updraft, the tornado forms.
