This is more a comment than an answer, but it's too long for a comment. Even if you could come up with a set of rules that meet your requirements, how would it work? It's one thing to write a set of rules on paper, quite another to enforce them. Especially to enforce them on the entire world. ESPECIALLY in a case like this, where anyone who breaks the rules has an inherent advantage over those who don't. If, say, one group breaks the rules and invents gunpowder, and then the group who are obeying the rules and are armed with only wooden spears come to stop them ... they might have a hard time stopping them. You'd have to have a government -- or something that is called by another name but in practice is a government -- that has the police or military power to crack down on anyone who breaks the rules, and that has spies everywhere to know when someone is breaking the rules. And this government would have to never deviate from the rules itself. It would have to be impossible for a group of dissidents to build a secret laboratory somewhere -- anywhere. It would have to be impossible for a group to move to some isolated place and create a new society. And this government would have to be able to do all this, worldwide, while using only the most primitive technology. I wouldn't say it's impossible, but wow, very hard. 

Well of course almost any religious believer would say that the God or gods he believes in DO affect the world. So how is what you are suggesting different from real life? (a) There is no question or ambiguity? The gods come down from Mount Olympus on fiery chariots and throw lightning bolts and their enemies, and there is no way that anyone who is not blind could say that this was not done by the gods? And they do this often enough that pretty much everyone in the world sees it regularly? (As opposed to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which say that God usually works in more subtle ways, and that "blatant" miracles are relatively rare so that most people only know about them by reading scripture, lives of saints, etc, not personal experience.) (b) There are multiple competing gods? Like in Graceo-Roman polytheism. (Modern Hinduism has many gods of course, but I don't know enough about Hinduism to say if the believe the gods compete and fight like the Greek gods.) I can see how (a) and/or (b) could put a strain on freedom of religion. In the real world, an atheist might be annoyed at Christian prayers, but he presumably is not literally afraid that the Christian prayers will result in God bringing down some judgement on him, because he doesn't believe there is a God to do so. But if the existence of these gods was undeniable, then knowing that my neighbor who worships the cow god is praying for judgement on all those who eat beef, I would not dismiss his prayers as vain appeals to an imaginary god. I'd have a real fear that his god would respond and do me harm. In the real world, if someone worships a different god than mine, I generally believe that his prayers and rituals are just a waste of time. They don't do me any direct harm. (Barring special cases, like he kidnaps me to offer me as a human sacrifice.) But in your proposed scenario, he very well might do me harm. So in the real world, it makes good rational sense to say, let everyone worship in his own way, and attempt to persuade others that his way is best if he so chooses, and see what works out. But in your scenario, you can't just "live and let live". It's not that they're worshipping a false god, it's that they're worshipping a very real god who is inimical to me. To the extent that the gods compete, I think freedom of religion would become very difficult to sustain. It would be too impractical. Like, I have no problem being tolerant of people with different skin colors or languages or favorite foods. But I do have a problem with being tolerant of people who steal and kill. If the gods do not compete, if they're all friendly to each other and tell their followers to respect each other, than all this goes away, and freedom of religion becomes like accepting that some people like pizza and some like tacos. There's no reason why I should care if your tastes are different from mine. 

I'd think ores from the asteroids would be the big one. I don't splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen and shipping this to Earth would be practical. Earth has a lot of water. Wouldn't it be cheaper to get it on Earth than to ship it from the asteroids? There was some discussion a few years back about manufacturing processes which could be done better in a weightless environment. Some pharmaceuticals, some ideas for other things where gravity makes the product have an uneven consistency, i.e. thicker at the bottom, and this is undesirable. Nice idea, though people were hard-pressed to come up with examples that would be worth the shipping cost. Granted the bulk of the cost is getting raw materials to orbit. If you start with raw materials from asteroids, many more processes would become economically viable. If we assume that the cost of getting things into orbit has been reduced -- which is probably essential to be able to get people to these asteroid colonies -- then what's the advantage of making something at the asteroids and shipping to Earth, versus making in Earth orbit? Sorry, I seem to be shrinking your list rather than adding to it. The only thing I can think to add: energy from solar power. I haven't done the math, but I think that's getting pretty thin at the asteroids, so that may not be very practical either. 

If the islands glow, then you can see other islands in the sky. You can navigate by having a map of the relative positions of these islands. Do the islands travel in orbits around something, or are they just floating motionless? Well, if they have gravitational fields, then if the laws of physics as we know them apply, they attract each other, so they have to move in orbits or they will slowly drift together and collide. How long has this place existed? How big are they and how far apart are they? Are there other forces involved? Etc. But moving or not, if the movements are predictable, you could make maps. Navigation would be simpler than on Earth, as you can always see your destination in the sky. Well, assuming it is not directly behind another island from your perspective, and that it's light is not drowned out by other light. If it's far enough away that it's light is too dim to see or to distinguish, then you'd use your maps. You'd say, yes, island A is far away, but you can see from this map that if we head toward B, and then from there head toward C, that then we'll be able to see A and complete the trip. I think the simplest method of describing positions would be to use Cartesian co-ordinates, i.e. x, y, and z with perpendicular axes. If there is no well-defined center of this place, pick an arbitrary point to be 0,0,0. Like the largest known island. Or some island that is a recognized social or cultural or scientific center. If there's no natural direction for the axes, just pick arbitrary directions and who cares? Just like, on Earth the equator and the poles are naturally-defined places, but there is no natural zero longitude. So we picked a place, Greenwich England, and we go with it. It could have been anywhere. As to terminology: We use north, south, east, and west because they come naturally from the fact that we live on the surface of a rotating sphere. In a free 3D space, if there's no center of rotation or anything else that defines a natural axis or basis of direction, you'd just have to pick something arbitrary. I imagine people would just make up names. They'd plot the 3 axes in arbitrary directions, and then make up names for those directions. So they call them fwac and plugh and boobaloo or whatever. If they were living and working with these names every day, they would seem completely normal and natural to them, and words like "north" and "west" would be strange, unfamiliar terms that would have to be explained.
