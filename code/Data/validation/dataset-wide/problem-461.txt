As, if not more important than length, is the chain line. Obviously related, but enough variation to cause problems, as I found out not when I got into my own bike maintenance. Sheldon (as always) shows a way to measure chain line here. The same page has table of various Bottom brackets and the length and chain-line measurements. Essentially you measure from the center of the chain rings (triple is easy, double measure half way between the rings) to the center of the seat tube to get your chain line. Then you should be able to match up a BB that will suit. 

If the pads have oil on them they need replacing. The discs can be cleaned if done properly and carefully. If the LBS did the work, take the bike back and they should put it right. From the sound of it, I would also be looking for another LBS. If they cannot service brakes and keep the oil off they are at probably sloppy - but even the best shops have the odd incident. However, as they returned the bike to you in that condition, it is dangerous, they have let poor work out the door. My future custom with them would be in serious jeopardy..... 

Despite what many think, efficient breathing at anaerobic threshold is not natural for humans, its a learned activity that needs training and practice. (We evolved as hunter gatherers, we were either strolling around well below anaerobic threshold, of chasing prey at maximum effort - anaerobic (or being chased...) Taking as read the bike fit is good and there are no medical issues, its most likely a training issue. It sounds like you know whats ended, but when the going gets tough, you forget about breathing. You get into a mode where you are in oxygen deficit, but other signs of high effort are missing - e.g. the burn from lactic acid, so your not feeling like your over cooking it. Slowing down feels like a cop out... As daft as is might sound, you should to set aside training time to practice breathing technique. Like any technique, it needs time to perfect, and more time before its automatic. Start at low effort and focus solely on breathing. Do this as a part of every training session. To start with, set aside entire training sessions where this is the main focus, then taper the amount down to a few minutes each session - Exactly same as you would do if your pedal stroke was inefficient and needed attention or you were having problems with fast down hill corners. Practice.... You could also consider activities that focus on awareness of breathing such as Yoga. 

An expanded geometry results in a stem that is higher than it would be on a bike with a horizontal top tube which in turn makes it easier to get the handle bars high relative to the saddle. To me this also looks a bit better than a standard frame with a tall stem. There is a bit more material in the frame, so it is probably heavier by some tiny bit. A compact geometry means that you get a lower standover for the same (virtual) frame size. This seems like a nice feature in a mountain bike. It probably makes the bike a bit heavier than a standard frame since (I'd guess) that seat posts are heavier than seat tubes and the top tube is longer than on a standard frame. Depending on what you want in a bike any of these choices can result in a good fit. So some of it comes down to what looks good to you. 

We've got a bike where the front hub (Shimano Alfine dynamo) uses a Center Lock rotor and the rear hub (also Shimano, go figure) uses an ISO rotor. The front hub is giving me fits trying to sort out why the rotor rubs intermittently, so I thought I'd try replacing the rotor. My thought is to get a Center Lock adapter and use an ISO rotor so that both ends of the bike would use the same type of disc. Seems like it would make life and maintenance a bit simpler. Question 1: Is there any reason why this would not be a good/acceptable idea? Are there substantial advantages to Center Lock? Question 2: Does the adapter convert a Center Lock hub to an ISO hub or does it convert an ISO rotor to a Center Lock rotor? In other words, do I attach the adapter to the hub (and leave it there) or do I attach it to the rotor and move it from rotor to rotor as they wear out? 

Years ago, the US Airforce commissioned the design of a 'perfect cockpit' for a new fighter, spending millions measuring and testing pilots and coming up with the right cockpit for the perfectly average pilot. Only to find there was no perfectly average pilots to fly plane. After that, they made planes with cockpits adjustable to the actual pilots that was flying the plane. Bikes take this further - the frame is not adjustable without making it heavy and unreliable, and unlike an aircraft, frames are relatively cheap compared to the the rest of the kit. Its cheaper and gives better bikes to make different frames. All that aid, the bike might fit you - The US Airforce never found their perfectly average pilot, maybe the manufacturer of that E-bike has found there perfectly average rider in you. 

Mino is a link that changes the geometry of the bike. High lifts the BB (about 10mm) and steepens the head tube (1/2 degree) compared to low. With the link set low the bike will be more stable but less agile, especially on down hills. With it high it will be more agile but less stable, with lower chance of pedal strike (due BB height). The difference is small, and may be imperceptible to an unskilled rider. As far as position, the best position is the one you like. There is no right or wrong. Try it on the trails you ride, and decide where you like it. Generally DH you would probably want it low, XC high. It will be far more important to get the suspension properly tuned up, tire pressures and bike fit correct before worrying about the link position. 

The advice I have seen for a stuck piston is a) hot soapy water, followed by Isopropyl Alcohol, followed by a small amount of brake fluid (Use the same that is in you brakes - mineral in your case) to lubricate the piston. If you google for "Stuck Bicycle Disc Brake piston" there is quite a lot of useful advise Warm soapy water on it's own cannot hurt. Although I have never needed to do this, I would use a syringe to direct the water at the pistons to waste away as much crud as possible. Move pistons out (being extremely careful not to drive them out too far - put a pair of old pads in before squeezing the lever... When pushing them back in, do it gently) Watch for a piston moving more than the other. If one is not moving, hold the other in to get it free. Then squirt water over them and wipe them off with a clean rag. If the crud contains too much in the way of oils, the water may not be enough - resort to the IsoP. Wipe a clean rag soaked in a small amount of brake fluid over the pistons. If desperate, a normal mineral oil, but what every you do, don't use too much. You need just enough to put a thin layer over the piston, and more and you risk getting it on the pads (very bad for them). Finally, and most importantly, get a clean dry rag and wipe the whole assembly down as clean and shiny as you can. Install pads and see how you got on. 

I think the only purpose of the pin is to retain the pad. So if you can convince yourself that the damaged pin isn't preventing the pad from sitting cleanly agains the "piston" and that it is prevented from dropping out, then I would be inclined to think you're ok. I've seen instructions for rebuilding BB-7 calipers, which makes me think that parts might be available – at least in some markets. The SRAM/Avid number for the "internals kit" is A150080A and they appear to be available, I found links to the kit at shops in the UK, in the US Amazon lists the item, but doesn't have stock. In any case a whole new brake assembly isn't too expensive (considering that you get a set of pads and a disk as part of the deal), so if you have any doubts I'd just go ahead and replace the caliper (or see if you can get parts). 

In a word, yes, you're correct in your assumption that "long reach" and "long pull" are different things. At 65 mm your brakes might even qualify as "extra long reach." The reach of rim brakes is the distance from the mounting bolt to the rim. Pull is the amount of cable that needs to be moved to get the brake shoes to clamp firmly against the rim. According to Sheldon Brown / Harris Cyclery, all caliper brakes use standard (short) pull levers. 

I probably don't do "proper" track stands since I don't ride a fixed gear bike, but if you can find a bit of a hill at a stop then you can kind-of-sort-of do a track stand (you pedal up the hill and let gravity pull you back down). Sometimes the crown of the road is enough… That said, I always sit, I didn't know you were supposed to stand, so I'd say keep working on it!
