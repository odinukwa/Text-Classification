First check that the handlebar is actually square to the front wheel. Next check that the seat is straight relative to the top bar. Stand in front of the bike, straddling the front wheel, and sight down the top tube. Verify that there is no twist in the frame causing the front steering tube to not be in line with the seat tube. Check the fork and frame for any other obvious out-of-alignment problems. (Note that a frame can be straightened if it's slightly bent.) Then check to be sure that neither of the crank arms is bent (a common problem with bikes that are frequently dropped on their sides). Also make sure neither of the pedal shafts is bent. 

What do you do with your car when it gets wet in the rain? The only thing you really need to worry about is the seat, and that's primarily because riding on a wet seat is unpleasant. (A shower cap is a handy thing to have to keep the seat dry.) Re the bearings, the only bearing that's apt to get wet is the bottom bracket, which is a "sealed" cartridge on most mid-grade modern bikes. Opening up that area and greasing the outside of the cartridge and the inside of the housing will help prevent rust there. Otherwise, repacking bearings every 10K miles or so is sufficient. You do need to clean the chain a little more often if you ride in wet weather, but that's about it. 

Understand that the concern is not generally things like a muscle or tendon tear that can occur with, eg, extreme weightlifting -- off-road bikers might be susceptible to that sort of injury, but not a road biker. Rather, the concern is the injury that may be done to joint surfaces and structures due to repeated force, above some "tolerable" level, applied to the joint. This can result in joint inflammation, tendinitis, and in some cases, a form of arthritis (with resulting permanent joint damage). And, unlike the torn tendon, this sort of "repetitive strain injury" may not be apparent until some time (days/weeks/months) after the injury has begun in earnest. Based on your "enhanced" description of the situation, you are likely on the cusp of a problem. Depending on your genetic makeup and physical condition you might be safe or might be in danger territory. At the very least it would be wise to tread carefully. (I'll add that one is most exposed to joint injury when the knee is tightly bent, vs when it is straighter. This is one reason why the seat should be as high as reasonably possible, and one should avoid riding a seriously undersized bike. 

"Remove valve cap, unscrew thingy in valve, and tap it a little - a jet of air shoots out. OK." You've got that right. If you have the proper pump, and the chuck is working properly, then simply pushing the chuck on and flipping the lever should do it. Normally, when you press the chuck on far enough a little button in the middle of the chuck will press the "thingy" down to let air out and let you read the pressure. It may be that your chuck is poorly designed (or not really "stem agnostic") and you'd do better with a screw-on adapter. (And some chuck designs require changing out the innards to do Presta valves.) (It really isn't that difficult and fussy with the right pump and the right technique.) 

When it breaks I fix it. I check wear on the chain (with a stretch gauge) every few months, and when I need to replace my rear cluster (as evidenced by poor shifting) it's time to repack the bearings. (This works out to about 5000 miles for me.) A bike kept inside in a dry environment doesn't deteriorate, save for the tires [and maybe, I suppose, hydraulic brake fluid]. (Yes, the lube does deteriorate, but it would take 30 years or so for it to be far enough gone to worry about.) So no need for service every 3 months or some such -- it's purely based on mileage and wear-and-tear. What can break?? Note that the things that can actually break on a bike are quite unpredictable. If chain, sprockets, and bearings are serviced regularly, tires (and brake pads) replaced when worn/cracked, cables and shifters given a spot of lube occasionally, and the cables examined for fraying and wear on the same occasions, there isn't much else you can do. Spokes can break, but you don't know if that will be at 100 miles or 10K, so you basically have to wait for one or two to break to know that it's time to relace the wheel. Freehub pawls, shifter pawls and springs, derailer springs, etc generally last forever but can fail without warning (though usually a bad pawl will begin to slip before it goes out entirely). A broken chain is generally the result of a seriously worn drive train, serious maladjustment of the derailers, or really lousy shifting on the part of the cyclist. Fork/frame failures occur, but only on bikes that have been seriously abused. Blowouts, of course, can occur, but are largely insensitive to maintenance. Probably the most likely failure (other than tire problems) is simply a bolt falling out somewhere. This is most common on racks and fenders, but can, eg, occur (in rare circumstances) on the bolt holding in a derailer idler wheel. So tightening bolts isn't a bad thing to do occasionally (if you know which ones to tighten and how tight). 

Yeah, the main issue is the geometry that determines the arc the wheel follows as it responds to upward force on the tire. Subtle changes in pivot points can affect that significantly. Beyond that the spring force and damping force that the shock applies at each point in the wheel arc is obviously also important. And differences in shock placement are one way that a manufacturer would "tune" this. There is also, of course, the physical stiffness and durability of the shock mounting scheme, and the simple fact that some schemes facilitate a good frame design better than others. And of course "coolness" and novelty of appearance are major criteria for the frame builder. One critical factor that isn't visible in those photos is the precise location of the pivot at the front of the chain stays. That probably affects "bob" more than any other factor. 

It is, in theory, possible to be vaguely accurate torquing bolts without an actual torque wrench. Torque is measured in applied force multiplied times the length of the lever arm. You achieve the same torque applying a 10 pound force to the end of a 6-inch lever as you do applying a 5 pound force to the end of a 12-inch lever. In both cases the torque is pounds times inches -- 60 inch-pounds. (And you can easily do the conversion to foot-pounds or newton-meters or whatever.) Measuring the length of the lever is fairly easy, of course (though you do need to take note of where on the lever you apply the force -- the "length" is from that point to the pivot point). Getting a good estimate of force, however, is trickier. Skilled bike mechanics tend to develop a "calibrated arm", and can feel, within an acceptable margin, how much force they are applying. (Understand that being within a factor of 2 is generally adequate.) The Saturday afternoon mechanic, on the other hand, may not be so skilled. One could presumably dig out a spring balance and use that to apply the force to the lever (socket wrench handle), but if you're going to that much trouble you might as well get a torque wrench. But, if you have some objects for which you know the weight, it is possible to lift the "reference" weight, getting a "feel" for it, and then apply the same force to the lever. One can even be "sorta" accurate scaling by half or by 2x (though beyond that is questionable). Note that I'm not saying that such "shade tree" techniques are to be preferred over having the proper tools, just that there is the option, if you are caught in a bind. 

Yeah, what Stephen says is about all I know (though I don't run with the racing crowd). Pointing at road debris is commonly done, but probably useless, since it doesn't allow time to react -- I prefer to just yell "Trash!", especially now that I have a bad arm and the signaling is more difficult. Using the hand signal (left arm (US) extended with elbow bent downward at about a 45 degree angle and with open palm facing backwards) for slowing is a bit more useful than pointing at road debris, but shouting "Slowing!" or "Stopping!" is still a better signal -- easier to accomplish, and more likely to get the attention of the rider behind. And, of course, there's the shouted "Car back!" signal given from the rear (no possible hand signal here) when a vehicle is overtaking a group of bikes, and "On your left/right!" shouted when overtaking another bike. (I'm sure that some cycling groups have additional agreed-upon signals, but I don't know of any others that would be generally recognized in the US.) For motorists, I use the basic hand signals -- left arm extended for left turn, right arm extended for right turn. I occasionally use the "slow" signal (described above) when needed to signal that a motorist needs to use caution (because, eg, of cyclists ahead that he may not be able to see), and I've used it once or twice when occupying a full lane to signal that I'm going to retain occupancy (such as when negotiating a single-lane bypass through a construction site). I also sometimes use the left (US) hand extended, palm down, with a repeated downward motion to signal "slow down", when there are cyclists or some other hazard ahead. When following others at all closely, cyclists need to learn to watch the feet, rear derailer, and rear brake caliper of the cyclist ahead. These signal speed changes, and careful observation will clue in the cyclist behind even when the cyclist ahead fails to somehow explicitly signal. 

Likely no single bike will optimize all of these. (Note that I didn't mention weight. Obviously, an unnecessary 50 pounds should be avoided, but, unless significant amounts of climbing are involved, 5 or 10 pounds, plus or minus, will have relatively little effect.) (I'll also add that the difference in efficiency between a single-speed bike and either a geared hub or a derailleur setup is minuscule. The only efficiency factor to be concerned with is the tires -- avoid low-pressure, heavily lugged tires.) 

When a belt doesn't stay on a pulley it's either because the pulley are misaligned or the belt is damaged. You should check the wheel/axle alignment by checking the space between the tire and the seat and chain (er, belt) stays -- make sure the tire's centered between the stays. If not that then likely the belt has become damaged. (When a belt is damaged, with the cords along one edge broken, it doesn't stay straight under tension but curls outward on the damaged side, and tends to creep off the pulley towards the damaged side.) 

With 23s at 100psi you may need to inflate daily. My 35s run at 100psi and I need to inflate every 3-4 days, and relative leakage rate increases as tire width decreases. But two things: 

Thought: Go to a building supply place and get a bundle of tapered shims. Probably the plastic ones would be best. Insert four shims, in pairs, with opposing tapers, one pair on each side of the crank shaft. Tap the shims in tighter and tighter until the arm pops off (or the bearing cup pops off, whichever occurs first). 

The touring bike will of course be slightly more heavily built (generally a steel frame). The touring bike will have a longer wheelbase. You will generally notice that the space between the seat tube and the rear wheel is fairly wide. (The longer wheelbase serves 3 purposes: More stable, smoother ride, better fender clearance, and better heel clearance for rear bags.) The wheels will be more heavily built (at least 32 spokes and maybe even 40 on the rear), with wider rims and tires -- at least 28, maybe 35-38. The touring bike will have eyelets on the front and rear dropouts to support racks and fenders. (This generally means two eyelets on each side of each axle. Plus there may be braze-ons about half way up the side of the fork for a "low rider" front rack.) And at least 2, perhaps 3 sets of bottle bosses. The touring bike will have a more "relaxed" geometry -- higher bar height, a little less "reach" (shorter top tube, etc), slightly more slope and "rake" to the fork. The touring bike will have a wider gear range and a lower low gear, and usually not as high a high gear.
