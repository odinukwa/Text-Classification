That is not true. The band of the Milky Way can be seen from any latitude on the planet. It just requires the right time of year and a dark sky. 

The problem is not that right ascension goes from 0 to 24 hours (or 0 to any other number). The problem is that the Earth is revolving around the Sun, and our time system is based on the Sun. Because of the motion around the Sun, one solar day (24 hours 0 minutes 0 seconds) is different than one sidereal day (23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds). So you need two clocks: one for the sun, and one for the stars. An example may help. Let's change right ascension to be from 0 to 100. At midnight (00:00) on day 1, let's define that 0 right ascension is on the meridian. At 23:56, the Earth has made one complete rotation relative to the stars, so 0 right ascension is back on the meridian. At 24:00, the Earth has made one complete rotation relative to the Sun (one day), but the right ascension has increased to 0.28 during the extra 4 minutes. Day 2. At 23:52, the Earth has completed a second full rotation relative to the stars, so the right ascension is again 0. But after two complete days (24:00 on day 2), the right ascension is now 0.56. 

I'm not aware of any official (i.e., IAU) definition of a multiple star system. However, as someone who used to do research in that field, I would interpret multiple star system as encompassing systems with two or more stars. So a binary system, a triple system, and a quadruple system are all multiple star systems. 

There just aren't any other mechanisms to keep the population excited in a Stromgren sphere. In principle collisions can also lead to excitations, but if you do an order of magnitude calculation you'll find that the time between collisions is much longer than the time to receive an ionizing photon. In a laboratory setting you might be able to coerce some particles into remaining in an excited state using the Quantum Zeno effect, but that won't happen in interstellar space. So without something to keep the atoms in an excited state, even if you start with everything in the excited state, in time $\tau$ you will find that everything has decayed to the ground state, with the exception of some very small fraction $\tau_{\textrm{ion}} / \tau$, which may have moved up to a higher energy state. Assuming the lifetimes of those very excited states are comparable, after a few more times $\tau$, you will find that even those will have decayed to the ground state. 

You might want to try a very dark night instead of a "dark day". :-) The "cluster of gas" that you mention is from countless stars. From a dark site, it looks like clouds, but you soon realize that they are not moving. It is not as well defined as in the photo, but it is impressive. In addition to needing a dark site far from lights, you need to look at the correct time of day and night. You want to look when the constellation of Sagittarius is at its highest. 

The right ascension of the point on the horizon and due west is LST - 6 hours, where LST is the Local Sidereal Time. The LST can be calculated from knowing the date, time, and longitude. The declination of the west point is 0 degrees. So the angle between that right ascension and 0 hours right ascension (the vernal equinox) is just the difference between the two. 

I saw the Cassini spacecraft visually through a 20 inch (500 mm) telescope when it flew by the Earth in August 1999. At the time of my sighting, it was just over 72000 miles (116000 km) away. The complete description is on the Seesat-L archives. I do not have the information, but I think the Apollo spacecraft were seen visually at a greater distance. 

I was reading this article finding evidence of Universe's origin, which describes that in 1 trillion years we may lose the ability to determine how the universe was created. The answer seems to be using hypervelocity stars. These are stars that have been ejected from their galaxy. Using the expansion of the universe, we can use the velocity of the star to then determine evidence of the Big Bang. But how does this work? Is there calculations we can do now that agree with our understanding of the universe and its age when working with hypervelocity stars? I understand finding a hypervelocity star is very hard to do. I guess my thought here is that astronomers have modeled this scenario and found that if we were to find a hypervelocity star, we could then use the scenario above to calculate the age. I'm assuming the age calculated agrees with current estimates. 

During stellar nucleosynthesis a star will convert a portion of its hydrogen atoms into helium. Is there a constant of how many tons of hydrogen is converted based on the mass of the star? Is it based on a percentage of the star's mass? Or can it vary? A Nasa blurb stated that 600 million tons of hydrogen per second are consumed by our own sun. Is there a mathematical formula that can tell you how much any star would consume and convert to helium? 

The short answer to your question is no, there is not dark matter between galaxies, at least at any appreciable level. There is ordinary matter between galaxies, called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The IGM is an extremely dilute, hot gas that pervades the space between galaxies. The typical density of the IGM is about one hydrogen atom per cubic meter and its temperature is somewhere around 10^6 K. These high temperatures keep the IGM in pressure equilibrium with any galaxies and prevent it from collapsing onto galaxies. Dark matter, however, is cold, and lacks the pressure support of the gas in the IGM, so it condenses onto galaxies. [1] One interesting difference between dark matter and ordinary matter is that dark matter lacks any sort of cooling mechanism. As a result, when ordinary matter collapses onto a galaxy, it can cool and condense into a relatively compact space and later form stars and planets. The dark matter, however, remains extended because it has no way to shed its gravitational potential energy. Galaxies therefore exhibit a substantial dark matter halo, where the ratio of dark matter to ordinary matter increases substantially a few galactic radii away from the center. Within the galaxy itself, ordinary matter is dominant by at least an order of magnitude, but the density of ordinary matter falls off exponentially while the dark matter falls off only with the cube of distance, leaving dark matter dominant a few galactic radii away from the galaxy. One interesting question is whether or not dark matter halos exist in intergalactic space without a corresponding host galaxy at the center. As far as we can tell, the answer to that seems to be no, or at least, such structures must be quite small and exceedingly rare. There are dwarf galaxies (only 10^6 solar masses or so) which have enormous dark matter halos (much out of proportion to their size, relative to the Milky Way), but nearly every halo seems to have at least some ordinary matter present, no matter how feeble. Cosmic voids are an even more extreme example. Voids are dominated by dark energy and therefore expand more rapidly than the rest of the universe. Voids tend to push any matter (dark or otherwise) into walls that separate them from surrounding voids. In a real sense, the universe is made of voids, and everything we know lies on the walls and filaments that separate them. This paper examined dark matter halos in cosmic voids and essentially found that there weren't any. In other words, they found that dark matter halos in cosmic voids have host galaxies just as often as dark matter halos outside of cosmic voids (which is to say, almost always). [1]: To be absolutely pedantic, I wouldn't doubt that there are a few dark matter particles whizzing about in intergalactic space. But I would be surprised if its density exceeded the (already puny) density of ordinary matter in the IGM. 

The azimuth angle from due south to the point where an object rises or sets is a function of the latitude (lat) and declination (decl), as follows: cos(angle) = -sin(decl)/cos(lat) This ignores refraction and the radius of the object, so it will introduce some inaccuracy for the Sun. (The refraction and radius of the Sun amount to 50 arcminutes. The change in azimuth when the Sun rises 50 arcminutes is the error in using this formula. Unless you are at a latitude near a pole, the equation should be accurate to a fraction of a degree.) (edit Jan 23). The maximum declination of the Sun to use in the my formula above is equal to either the mean obliquity of the ecliptic (ζ in your equations) or the corrected obliquity (ϵ) depending on the desired accuracy. The minimum declination of the Sun is equal to the negative value of the obliquity. Thus, you can calculate the maximum and minimum azimuth of the rising and setting sun without knowing the date or time. The obliquity is approximately 23.5 degrees, and if you use a latitude of 40 for example, my formula indicates the cosine of the rise point is -sin(23.5)/cos(40) which yields a rise point of 121.4 degrees east of south, or an azimuth of 58.6 degrees (180-121.4=58.6). Sunset is 121.4 degrees west of south, or an azimuth of 301.4 (180+121.4=301.4). 

When talking about the longitude of ascending node you must be very careful to define the reference plane that you are using. As you state, due to the Earth's axial precession, the First Point of Aries moves along the ecliptic over ~26,000 years. This is because the celestial equator is slowly precessing about the ecliptic. Now, in the case of the orbital elements of other planets, the longitude of ascending node is again with respect to the First Point of Aries. As your intuition suggests, the orbits of the outer planets won't be influenced by the precession of the Earth's equinox. This means that the longitudes of ascending node will not be constant over long time periods. If we suppose that the physical orbits are fixed (i.e., the planets are not perturbing each other), the change in the longitudes of ascending node will be entirely due to the Earth's precession. When you take both these changes into account, you will find that they cancel each other out and the position of these orbits remains fixed with respect to the distant stars. You can see in the orbital elements provided by NASA that they are given with respect to the J2000.0 epoch. In other words, the orbital elements are provided for a single point in time, and to get the orbital elements today you must take into account the Earth's precession. $URL$ 

If your latitude is between 0 and 23.4 degrees, the longest arc is before the Sun reaches the zenith. For example, an observer at 20 degrees latitude witnesses the longest arc when the Sun is at about 13 degrees declination which is 7 degrees before the Sun reaches the zenith. If you live north of 23.4 degrees, the Sun is never overhead. North of 30 degrees, the longest arc is when the Sun is highest in the sky. I can go into more details and the math, but I do not know if I should do it here or maybe in a new question. 

Positions are usually given relative to the observer, not relative to the object. So instead of saying "I am under the star X", you would say "star X is overhead". The word for an object directly overhead is zenith: "the star X is at the zenith". 

The key to answering your question is to know the albedo of the asteroid compared to the Moon. The Moon is rather dark (reflecting 7% to 12% of the light if I remember correctly, about as black as worn asphalt). I think, but do not know with certainty, that the asteroid would not be much darker. For the dimensions that you give, the asteroid would be approximately the same apparent size as the moon: 0.45 x 0.65° compared to the Moon's 0.5°. So both have approximately the same albedo and approximately the same size. Therefore I say that the asteroid would be visible in the daylight. Also this is a sci-fi story, correct? If you can get the asteroid into that orbit, then anything is possible. :-) 

No, for a black hole to form the core of a star much larger than our sun must collapse into itself, forming a singularity. This happens after a star has expended it's fuel no longer being able to offset the inward force of gravity. The result is a rapid release of its outer layers in a supernova. The resulting core then collapses into the singularity. The mass is so great that this singularity is an infinite bend in space time. Of note, if we took your object and were able to squeeze it down so small that it's radius reached the Schwarzschild radius, it could become a black hole. The Mariana Trench could not provide enough pressure to this. There exists little fish and organisms near the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Dropping something like a penny would just cause it be distorted by the pressure above it. 

In the final energy state of the universe, there exists a hypothesis that all matter will have fallen into black holes and neutron stars. If, through Hawking radiation, after all matter is consumed and black holes eventually do dissipate, what is left of our Universe? I may be describing Heat Death, but I'm not 100% sure. However, due to the Law of Conservation of Energy, I suspect that energy will be all that is left, only in equilibrium meaning no ability for energy to form matter. In the event I'm wrong and there exists no matter and no energy, would the term Universe still be applicable here? 

I think I mis-read your question before. Let me rephrase it to make sure I understand. In step D (moving the scope from Sirius to M42), that process took 5 minutes to complete. Or maybe it took 30 seconds to complete, but you then took a 4.5 minute coffee break :-). So during that 5 minutes of time since you calibrated the setting circle, M42 has drifted another 5 minutes to the west. 

The position angle P of a body ($\alpha_1, \delta_1$) with respect to another body ($\alpha_2, \delta_2$) can be calculated from $$tan(P)={sin(\Delta\alpha)\over cos(\delta_2)tan(\delta_1)-sin(\delta_2)cos(\Delta\alpha)}$$ where $\Delta\alpha = \alpha_1-\alpha_2$. If the denominator is negative, the position angle lies in the range of 90 to 270 degrees. Reference: Jean Meeus, Astronomical Algorithms, Second Edition, 

Of course, all of these methods require a mount that can be moved slowly and smoothly in both right-ascension and declination to keep the guide star centered. Also, the mount needs to be an equatorial mount and accurately aligned. (More expensive mounts can be alt-azimuth mounts and use a gadget to rotate the camera during the exposure.) 

You might find this paper helpful: $URL$ Look specifically at Eq. 5 for the wavelength dependence. To get the intensity, use Equation 1. The value of $u$ can be found in the caption to Figure 2. 

I see no reason why this wouldn't work. The innermost Galilean moons are in a 1:2:4 resonance so it's clearly a stable orbital configuration. They could all be tidally locked if you want, but the planet itself can't be tidally locked with all of them. If the planet were tidally locked it would likely be locked with the innermost moon. Also of note, the Galilean moons all have eccentricity less than 0.01 and inclinations less than 0.5 degrees. 

I don't know about names for the planets, specifically, but the orbits are called S-type and P-type: 

Andy Gould proposed a classical derivation of Hawking radiation in a somewhat obscure paper from 1987. The essential argument is that a black hole must have a finite, non-zero entropy (otherwise you could violate the second law of thermodynamics with a black hole). Moreover, the entropy of the black hole must depend only on its area (otherwise you could change the area of a black hole via the Penrose process and lower its entropy and make a perpetual motion machine). If a black hole has an entropy and a mass, then it has a temperature. If it has a temperature, then it must radiate thermally (otherwise you could again violate the second law of thermodynamics). Of course, if you look at the Hawking radiation temperature, there's a Planck's constant in there, so it has to know something about quantum mechanics, right? But it turns out that it's actually thermodynamics in general that knows about quantum mechanics, not general relativity --- Planck's constant is only needed to keep entropies finite (and therefore temperatures non-zero). This is true of black holes and blackbodies alike.
