Earth can hold only 8 billion people If a child is being born and this child breaks the 8 billion rule, this happens: Wait 30 minutes. If someone else dies in this time, then everything is OK If not, take every human older than 32 minutes, and randomly kill one 

100 - 150 years YOLO my bruh. The swag is OVER 9000 with you. Peace out, LOL. Lets face it: Even though we feel that English is the same, it is not. 150 years ago was time of Civil War and also year when book Alice in the wonderland was published. You could push it up to 200 years if you are good in Oxford English, but then going to the past, you should watch your language. And using my crystal ball, I would say it would be the same when going to the future. On one hand, the language would be influenced by population shift and by inventions. We did not know what "iPod" stands for just several years ago. In 150 years in to the future you may end up sounding like book nook 

It makes sense to play music and sing shortly before the battle. It improves morale of your troops and lowers the morale of the enemy. There is story from Czech history, that when Hussites were raiding the country, one battle ended before it could even start, because the enemy did flee just after the Hussites singing a battle song 

It is the time of year we all have been waiting for. Ho, ho ho! The Star Wars are around the corner! Help me design scientifically plausible light-saber: In other words: What has to happen in order to have light-sabers available? 

Large hydrogen bomb being very deep - aka the Armageddon approach, but instead going to the asteroind you stay home, dig deep, even deeper ... basically as deep as possible to the Earth core and place huge bomb here. Imagine having there several Tsar Bomba exploding at the same time. The plausibility of destroying a whole planet to the pieces is very high. And even if you do not succeed, not even the Jedi would feel it ;) 

Assuming realisticly-optimistic scenatrios, we made it to year 2100 without losing knowledge how harmful cigarretes are. Yet, at least half of modern population keeps smoking. Why? P.S.: I am not affiliated with any tobacco company 

Let's face it: Fully electric car was total sci-fi just 15 years ago. And the fact that it could drive itself was totally unthinkable. With that in mind, lets talk about next logical step: What needs to happen in order to have fully electric airliner in place? In other words: I want to have an passenger airplane which is fully powered by electric power (batteries). 

Design and Marketing is the key Have a look at today cellphones. While from engineering point of view, you would say that the models with replaceable battery should win (once I am out of energy, I can switch to recharged battery), the latter is true and one of the most desired phone comes with non-replaceable battery. So, who do you aim for? Who is the target customer? Gender stereotypes: If it is woman, the weapon has to be red. If it is for a guy, it has to be big. And if Apple sells it, people will buy it even if it can fire only 4 shots, where the competitive one from Google can fire 12 and has replaceable cartrige. (Yes, you will need the gun to finally resolve once for all the holy war of who is better. Apple or Google?) So, whatever design has better advertisement, it is winner 

Build a tower and put him on the top - Best. Prison. Ever. But beware, do not make the tower without a roof, since we know, how Gandalf The Grey escaped Alternatively: Put him deep underground. in well maybe. It is nice, that you can walk through the walls, but if there is rock only around you and bonus, you do not know where actually you are? Easy How to feed him? Tower: Give him rope good enough to go into middle. Give him food into some place in the middle of tower, where you get using really tall ladder. If he wants food, he has to put his rope up and wait. Well is better, because you can simply throw bread down and there will be always some water. 

So, in same terms, it would be simply unthinkable to use knowledge you obtained without permission of your teacher. Imagine doing so would "kill" your social status. People reject to talk to you and even consider you being perverted for doing so. That would practically mean, that almost no one would use knowledge they were not approved to 

Copypaste the British Monarchy (ish): Head of state: Arcmage - highest mage of all (aka the King / Queen) I offer to give him/her representative functuions, and also veto rights to outrule ruling of House of Mages or House of Muggles (see later). But such veto could be overvoted. House of Mages: (aka House of Lords) I offer this to be say 81 seats, where Arcmage has one seat. All seats are voted by public, but only mages can run for a seat here. Otherwise give them about same rules as House of Muggles (see later) 

After watching first Shrek, I got interested in one detail: Can you build a castle which is surrounded by lava, using medieval technology? For scope of this question: Imagine ultimate wealthy king/queen (resources are not a problem). This kingdom wants to build castle to treasure its wealth. What if we build the castle guarded by lava? The kingdom has access to anything which could be plausibly made before year 1500 CE. Also assume there is suitable volcano. Can the kingdom build it? 

Add popular culture: Just to note. My kid (2.5 yo) totally loves the movies from Cars franchise. When I was young, I totally dig the Krtek fairy tales. And when my mom was young, she was also influenced by popular culture. So, what is popular in your future? Is it space exploration? Then popular-astronaut action figure is a must. Is it sports? Then blernsball themed toys are the most popular. You get the idea? 

Start with having some taboo If you are intelligent species, you do not talk about something. We like to have something hidden, because it does not go well with our "perfect" world. Good picks to start: 

Yes. And we should program it Do not let machines decide what such religion should be. Program it. Teach them religion. I do not say they should believe in Silicon Heaven, but they should at least have some core beliefs. And such core beliefs of AI should be: 

No, as long as people do not change their mindset Common joke in socialist/communist Czechoslovakia was, that communism is really great idea, just the people are not getting it. Thats why the party in power renamed the system to "real socialism" in late 80s. And then it failed completely in 1989 Share your toys, kids And not just toys, but everything. Our monkey brains are not ready for it. So even if current capitalism system fails, the next system will be most probably capitalism-like, because deep down we like this scenario better: I have 5 apples, you have 7 oranges. I will trade two apples for an orange than this: I have 5 apples, you have 7 oranges. It means that we both have enough fruit to feed ourselves together and it is irrelevant who eats apples and who eats oranges Space colonization needs cooperation of loads people Apple and orange sharing may work as long as we both know each other. But building space ships needs cooperation of loads of people who may not know each other. And almost everyone has to perform their job perfectly to have the mission be successful. In current system, we solve it by paying these people money. And we also pay money to other people who check the work of the first group of people. So although it is not impossible to accomplish, it is unthinkable under current mindset. 

Scarcity is part of currency In trade, you need scarcity. In trade, you exchange something which has value for you and get something what has value for them. So, generally, step 1: Getting plastic should be relatively hard. In postapocalyptic world, people controlling landfills (full of valuable plastic) would be really rich, because plastic would have a value in your world You need strong authority accepting plastic as payment: It boils down into who accepts what. Barter-and-trade would be still pretty in common, but also you would be willing to accept bottlecaps or plastic pieces simply because Brotherhood of Steel accepts them. In realistic post-apocalyptic world, such authority would be probably military based. They have valuable things to offer (weapons and ammo) and if they accept plastic (for whatever reason), then plastic can be universally accepted tool of trade, because you know, that in worst case, you can buy ammo from the Brotherhood for plastic and barter ammo for food (if food owner is silly enough to not accept plastic in first place)
