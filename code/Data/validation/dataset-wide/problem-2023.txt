I think that you could have done better, but I disagree with answers that say you completely failed and should have done X or Y instead. It's important to understand that a CEO needs to delegate: this is how she uses her time for the right thing. Being executive implies commanding, not doing! I can see why your CEO was irritated at being brought in after believing he'd handed the task off. He has better things to do. This does put you in a difficult position when you feel like you don't have the required resources to do the task. However, without seeing the exact list of basic phone requirements you were given, it's hard to say whether your questions were warranted or not—just maybe going straight back to the CEO with them may not be the best strategy. Here are some suggestions for the future. When given a task that you feel isn't in your area of expertise, or you don't think you have enough information to carry it out, you can do several things: 

The HR department of the employer I spoke about above passed out a break-down of each employee's TCC. In my case, the bit that didn't show up in my pay-check came to +35% of my salary. When factoring that against the TCC of my market-rate peers I was actually pretty close to market-rate. Salary isn't everything. And then there are the other 'intangibles', which are very hard to quantify, but employers try (hard) to foster. These are value adds to the "benefits of working here" column that don't show up on the pay-check. Employers try to exploit this because most people are not solely in it for the money, and is why most job postings have "and we're a great place to work" somewhere in there. This is where ping-pong tables and beer in the fridge come from, but it is also how well the office works together. An office that works really well together is one that is retentive. Your hypothetical female programmer may have found herself a workplace free of the microaggressions that so plagued her previous workplaces (internships, OSS work, pickup work during college, etc), which means she'll happily take a 20% pay cut just so she doesn't have to put up with all of that crap. This is a good example of non-monetary compensation, If employees aren't asking for raises, or new-hires aren't regularly forcing the organization to up their rates of pay, pay can slip below market-rate due to simple inattention. That's a market force too, it's call inertia. 

It is not pushy at all; I find it perfectly friendly. If I were to suggest any edits, I might suggest being a bit more concise (particularly if you are in a STEM field). I might say something like: 

Does she really? If your supervisor is serious about you handling this, then you need to do so. I would 

Ask the supervisor to tell your co-worker that you are in charge Clarify what sort of recourse you have if she does not comply (can you send her home, fire her, etc.). It's likely this person will eventually need to be fired, so you should clarify what steps have to happen before she can be fired. Sit down with this person and tell her your expectations. You can be friendly, but be very clear. Don't expect her to offer to help you - explicitly order her to do what you want her to do, and don't be mad at her for not doing things you haven't clearly asked her to do. If she refuses to follow your instructions, use whatever recourse you have. 

I would not even mention your perception that you were told not to do it (a fact which is debatable based on your report of what he actually said). I wouldn’t apologize unless sorely pressed to it (though then genuinely for having done something injurious that you didn't intend), and I definitely wouldn’t say I’d done it on my own time, as if you’re salaried then all the energy you spend in work belongs to your company, and if you’re paid hourly then it was illegal to not report the hours. I'd play it like this: 

Frankly, companies that switch to "unlimited vacation" always see the amount of employee vacation go down. Anyone trying to sell you on the idea that it's better for employees is selling you a false bill of goods. A better phrase than unlimited vacation is indeterminate vacation. You have no idea how much vacation you'll get, and whether it will hurt you to take it. How would you like to go to work for "unlimited pay" where you choose your own pay rate, but your employer decides if you are abusing the system—and if so, you're fired? Would you feel safe? Or would you ratchet back your pay just a bit to achieve that safety? So similarly, it would be an "indeterminate pay" system. Which sounds like a horrible, horrible way to work. And if the company's fortunes turn, or they're bought by another company, who's to say that doing the same job to the same quality level next year as this year will warrant the same pay in the eyes of your employer? 

Speaking as a Systems Administrator, I've run into just this kind of thing (it wasn't Bitcoin, but something like Seti@Home). This is a bit different since I'm the officially responsible party for such systems and can take action on my own authority, but the principles guiding how I respond also apply to you. There are two competing interests at work here: 

There is also more to compensation than mere salary. There are a lot of books out there on non-monetary compensation. For an example of how under-paid techies can stay in one spot despite known pay disparity vs. market-rate, take a look at the previous job I listed above. That job was sticky for a variety of reasons. There is another value that employers know about called the total cost of compensation for a worker. This value includes things that don't show up in the pay-stub, or if they do they're in the negatives column: 

Or, your supervisor may be saying "handle it" as in "don't bother me." In this case, I think you should make your supervisor aware of the situation -- I would draft a memo (you may need someone to help you with the writing) where you say something like: "Here is a list of what I did last night: [blah]. Here is a list of what coworker did last night: [blah]. This happens every night. I wanted to document this so that I will not be blamed when things get missed. Please let me know how you wish to proceed." Then I would just do your work and ignore the coworker as much as possible. 

Contacting the company is a good idea. Things may have fallen through the cracks, in which you following up will help, or they may be on the fence about you, in which case you following up will also help. Contacting upper management is more sensitive. How large is the company? For a small (<15 person) company, this is maybe a good idea; for a very large company, maybe less so. If you do contact them, make sure you indicate that you applied through the proper channels and are contacting them just to make sure that nothing falls through the cracks, as you weren't sure who is leading the search. Contacting upper management through Facebook strikes me as unprofessional. Things may be different in a young, start-up culture though. If you go this route, I would be very brief and simply say that you sent in your application, haven't heard back yet, and hope to be able to meet with him soon. 

Giving the "out" of the intern saying "oh, yeah, I meant no disrespect" lets him save face and repair the relationship in the most painless way possible. There is no need to extract a confession that he did mean it disrespectfully or to garner some huge apology. The point here is not power-over but successful internship. If after all this, the negative behavior continues, you can address it more head-on. There is no reason you can't give a performance goal to an intern just like you would to a problem employee, or use any other strategy you would use with a regular employee. But remember that the interns are NOT experienced in the work world and should be given a break or two while you gently, but firmly, accustom them to the standards of the professional work world. 

Your new CEO is right and you are being overpaid. In this case, looking for a new job will convince you of this before you burn a bridge. Your new CEO is wrong and you are being underpaid, and will change his mind when presented with new evidence. Since you are underpaid, it should be easy to find someone who will compensate you properly; with another offer in hand, he will pay you more. Your new CEO is wrong and you are being underpaid, and will not change his mind when presented with new evidence. Since you are underpaid, it should be easy to find someone who will compensate you properly; you can then accept this job and all is well. In this case, your current company is about to have problems, and it will be good that you are out.
