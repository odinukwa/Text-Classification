Let $\mathcal{G}$ denote a (stable) tangential structure such as $O$, $SO$, $Spin$, or $Pin^\pm$. Which bordism classes $[M,f]\in\Omega_*^\mathcal{G}(X)$ are represented by an $f:M\rightarrow X$ where the $\mathcal{G}$-manifold $M$ fibers over $S^1$? 

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a monoidal category. There is a notion of Morita equivalence of algebra objects internal to $\mathcal{C}$. Does each Morita class have a symmetric Frobenius representative? A Hopf representative? Following arXiv:math/0111139, suppose $\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple and rigid with finitely many irreducible objects and irreducible unit. Each indecomposable semisimple module category over $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to one of the form $\text{Mod}_\mathcal{C}A$ for some algebra object $A$ internal to $\mathcal{C}$; such algebras are called indecomposable semisimple, and their Morita classes are in bijective correspondence with such module categories. In this language, my question is whether, given such a module category $\mathcal{M}$ over $\mathcal{C}$, there is a symmetric Frobenius (or Hopf) algebra object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that $\text{Mod}_\mathcal{C}A$ is equivalent to $\mathcal{M}$. If not, are there conditions on $\mathcal{C}$ under which $A$ exists? 

There are two ways in which higher categories appear in topological field theory: in extended TFTs and in TFTs with defects. How are these appearances related? According to the Atiyah-Segal axioms, a d-dimensional TFT is a symmetric monoidal functor \begin{equation*}\text{Bord}_d\rightarrow\mathcal{C}\end{equation*} where the target category $\mathcal{C}$ is a symmetric monoidal category, typically $\text{Vect}$. The objects of $\text{Bord}_d$ are closed $(d-1)$-manifolds and map to the vector spaces of $\text{Vect}$ under the TFT. The morphisms are d-dimensional bordisms of the closed $(d-1)$-manifolds and map to the linear maps of $\text{Vect}$. This description can be "extended down" to define a d-dimensional n-extended TFT as a symmetric monoidal $n$-functor \begin{equation*}\text{Bord}_d^n\rightarrow\mathcal{C}\end{equation*} where $\mathcal{C}$ is now an symmetric monoidal $n$-category. The objects of $\text{Bord}_d^n$ are $(d-n)$-manifolds (for a "fully extended" TFT, i.e. $n=d$, the bordism objects are points) and map to the objects of $\mathcal{C}$, which can be thought of as $(n-1)$-categories. One should really specify $\mathcal{C}$ as some extension of $\text{Vect}$, but I am ignoring this technicality by thinking of the n-category of all (small) $(n-1)$-categories. More generally, $k$-morphisms are $(d-n+k)$-dimensional bordisms between $(d-n+k-1)$-manifolds and map to $(n+k-1)$-categories. There are also technicalities surrounding how one manages "manifolds with corners" in $\text{Bord}_d^n$, but allow me to gloss over them here. Meanwhile, one uses higher categories to decorate manifolds with defects. In this picture, $k$-dimensional manifolds are decorated with $k$-dimensional (extended?) TFTs called "$k$-defects." Lower dimensional submanifolds can be decorated with "defects within defects." The $k$-defect assigned to a $k$-dimensional "boundary" between two $(k+1)$-dimensional regions, each with attached $(k+1)$-defects, amounts to a morphism of $(k+1)$-defects. Fusion of defects and sub-defects endows the set of $k$-defects with the structure of a $k$-category. (For details, see $URL$ If we again imagine the $k$-category of (small) $(k-1)$-categories, we can understand decoration as an assignment of $(k-1)$-categories to $k$-manifolds. This construction of TFT with defects feels "upside down" compared to extended TFT: $k$-manifolds are decorated by $(k-1)$-categories and map to $(d-k-1)$-categories under the TFT functor. I realize that decoration is not a functor from a bordism category, but is it a functor in some other sense (from some category where higher degree morphisms are lower dimensional submanifolds)? Defects may have an interpretation as inserted operators (Wilson loops, surface operators, etc); can these two formalisms be combined to compute path integrals with operator insertions in an extended theory? In general, I am curious about the relation between how higher categories are used to define an extended TFT and how they are used to characterize TFTs with defects. Here is a particular problem from $URL$ Consider a fully extended 4D TFT. The TFT functor assigns $1$-categories to Riemann surfaces $\Sigma$. Meanwhile, in the defect description, 2D TFTs form a $2$-category. Restricting ourselves to a single object leaves us with a symmetric monoidal category of $1$-dimensional domain walls (essentially boundary conditions) of the 2D theory. Is this category of boundary conditions identified with the category assigned by the TFT functor (as is claimed)? It seems that this identification is only possible since $\dim\Sigma=2=\text{codim }\Sigma$ in dimension four and does not reflect a general relation between extended TFT and TFT with defects. 

Ignoring the absence of sphericality from the first definition (is it implied by ribbon?), these definitions disagree unless the answers to the above are affirmative (perhaps assuming fusion and sphericality). 

For a generalized homology theory $h$ and a Serre fibration $F\rightarrow E\rightarrow B$, we can define an Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence\begin{equation}E^2_{p,q}=H_p(B,h_q(F))\Rightarrow h_{p+q}(E)\end{equation}Suppose we have determined $E^\infty_{p,q}$ for all relevant $(p,q)$ and want to find $h_n(E)$. We have\begin{equation}\bigoplus_pE^\infty_{p,n-p}=\text{gr }h_n(E)\end{equation}where $\text{gr}$ is the associated graded space for some filtration $F_ph_n$ on $h_n(E)$. This determines $h_n(E)$ up to extension. Are there results about how to solve the extension problem for certain theories $h$? We sometimes have that $\text{gr }h_n(E)=h_n(E)$, in which case $h_n(E)$ is trivially obtained from $E^\infty_{p,q}$. For which $h$ and $E$ is this true? In my limited experience, this often (though not always?) holds when $h$ is ordinary homology $H$ or oriented cobordism $\Omega^{SO}$ and $E$ is the classifying space $BG$ of a finite abelian group $G$. Meanwhile, spin bordism tends to be less trivial; in particular, suppose $E^\infty_{p,n-p}=\mathbb{Z}_{k_p}$, then $\text{gr }\Omega^{spin}_n(BG)=\Omega^{spin}_n(\text{pt})\bigoplus_{p=0}^{n-1}\mathbb{Z}_{k_p}$ often (always?) becomes $\Omega^{spin}_n(BG)=\Omega^{spin}_n(\text{pt})\oplus\mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N=\prod_{p=0}^{n-1} k_p$. Are these examples supported by general results? 

(This is intended as a comment on Thomas Forster’s point above, “i think there is a literature about them that goes back earlier than Quine,” but I’m over the character limit.)     Much earlier than Quine; Frege uses the trick in §10 of the Grundgesetze, setting (loosely, in modern terms) the True and False to their own singletons. He considers using the trick in greater generality, à la Quine, in footnote 17: “A natural suggestion is to generalize our stipulation so that every object is regarded as a course-of-values, viz., as the extension of a concept under which it and it alone falls.” I would be stunned if this did not influence Quine’s use, either directly or indirectly, subconsciously or consciously.     Richard Heck discusses the stipulation is great detail in Part I of Reading Frege’s Grundgesetze, as part of his treatment of The Julius Caesar Problem, i.e., how can we be sure that the extension of some concept is not equal to Julius Caesar?     Personally, I feel that it is still too soon for Frege to worry about The Julius Caesar Problem. As he pointed out elsewhere, discussing a language that hasn’t yet been fully formalized is fraught with peril, and “Julius Caesar” is not yet a precisely-defined term in a formal language.  (Perhaps Caesar will end up being formalized as the extension of a concept after all—I don’t want to pre-judge the formalization of zoology.)  And obviously his proof of referentiality in §10 has to break down somewhere, or it would have been a consistency proof for naïve set theory. 

To follow up on Michael Beeson’s answer (I’m not allowed to post comments yet), Robin Gandy’s paper was “Church's Thesis and Principles for Mechanisms” in The Kleene Symposium ($URL$ He established that “Turing's analysis of computation by a human being does not apply directly to mechanical devices,” provided a “set-theoretic form of description for discrete deterministic machines,” and “proved that if a device satisfies the principles then its successive states form a computable sequence.” The most surprising point is that the result depends on non-Newtonian physics, in particular the impossibility of instantaneous action at a distance. The term “Gandy machine” is sometimes used for this variant of Turing machine, e.g. by Blass and Sieg; the notion even has its own entry in the Esoteric Programming Languages wiki. (Disclaimer: Robin was my supervisor, and Turing was his, so I’m hardly unbiased.)

[Mathematical Reviews 42 #8300], but note that the crucial part of the consistency proof in both [Friedrichsdorf 1979] and [Oberschelp 1973] is merely a reference to [Oberschelp 1964a], which uses a significantly different formalism.

To address part of your question, the iPad is far more than a toy for mathematicians, especially for reading mathematical articles. Goodreader is the best means of reading and annotating PDFs I’ve ever seen; in particular, the usual size of LaTeX articles fits very well on the screen, with a little zooming, even in portrait mode. I’ve virtually eliminated my use of my printer, both for reading others’ articles and correcting my own XeLaTeX output. Be very sure to test a PDF reader on real articles before it’s too late; even Adobe renders the Computer Modern font unacceptably on-screen, though with decidedly different results in different situations and platforms, and Okular on Linux is virtually unreadable at 100% zoom. For note-taking, I’m not a big fan of raw handwritten text (disclaimer: I worked at Apple during the Newton days, and at Palm); I expected to have to buy a hardware keyboard for my iPad, but haven’t needed to yet. 

Church’s “Set Theory with a Universal Set” (see, e.g., Thomas Forster’s article) has a set of all sets, and Church provides a model (actually an interpretation in ZFGC) for it. He never published the actual consistency proof, though, and after looking in the Church archives at Princeton, I suspect that he abandoned it, as well as a couple of more complicated theories in which he was attempting to converge with New Foundations. I provide a full consistency proof in an article I’ve submitted to Logique et Analyse, for a variant in which the singleton function is a set (which is impossible in New Foundations), though the natural generalization leads to a variant of the Russell Paradox, the set of all non-self-membered sets equinumerous to the universe. Arnold Oberschelp also has a set theory with a universal set and the singleton function, though his consistency proof is difficult to verify, as a key part is merely a reference to an earlier article which uses a significantly different formalism. 

Have a look at Church’s (first) Set Theory with a Universal Set, which is equiconsistent with ZFGC, though Church didn’t publish a full proof, and I think he abandoned the proof in his archives at Princeton. (My forthcoming doctoral thesis completes the proof for a variant with the singleton function as a set.) His archives also contain lecture notes on some more complicated theories with approximately the same name, but I believe he gave up on those theories, not just the details of the consistency proofs. • Alonzo Church (1974). “Set Theory with a Universal Set,” Proceedings of the Tarski Symposium.
