I find them used for less than $1000 every once in a while. Someone thinks they are going to ride across the country and never get around to it. You can install touring tires and use it as touring bike. Also great for shopping. 

Many helmets are offered in various sizes. Often the cheaper helmets will only come in one size. This is an example of a helmet offered in 3 sizes Bell Lumen. Many of the helmets also offers an adjustable band. A mountain bike helmet should work fine for commuting. 

It is a lot easier to get pushed around 1 meter than I thought it would be. The equation is speed km/hr * sin(angle) * correction time sec * 1000/k * hr/3600sec A nimble bike with wider tire is clearly going to be more maneuverable. The first reaction may be to turn into the wind and that just delays the actual correction. You actually need to initially turn away from the wind so you can lean into the wind. You see riders that immediately turn into the wind and just get pushed over. Also city versus county. In the country you can watch trees and grass to see it coming. In the city you can get wind tunnel effect and hit with a blast on just mildly windy day - in that case you can look at pedestrians. 

A quick way is to get the closest then then scale p is presure d is diameter pScale = pKnown * dKnown * dKnown / dScale / dScale here a close is 26 x 2.4 16 gram so pScale = 27 * 2.4 * 2.4 / 4.5 / 4.5 = 6.68 p is linear with mass so 25gram = 6.68 * 25 / 16 = 12 but on a fat bike I would just carry a high volume pump 

Most cars have a tow loop. It is pretty strong as it is built to tow the car. Loop a cable around the bikes and lock it to the tow loop. 

In that extreme cross chain configuration you have the maximum amount of chain for the derailleur to take up. And you also have the least amount of chain tension. Combine that with on the least number of teeth engaged and you have the configuration that is most likely to jump. Should it jump no. It is a shop problem - maybe. In just 11 months the spring in the derailleur could have weakened. Or if you ride on the small gear in the rear even a bit it will wear and new chain might skip. But given it does not skip on other front gears I would chalk it up to chain tension. The shop may have too many chain lengths. In biggest front and rear could a chain length be removed? Cross chaining a road bike or the first two chain rings is something that happens. But on a mountain bike in the granny gear that extreme cross chaining is just not something that should come up. I would not put that kind of stress on a chain even to test. Some front derailleur have a trim for big to big. This make sense to me as you may come to a stop but will get back up to speed soon. And now you have maximum teeth evolved. I don't know if trims comes in a 3 speed and it would make less sense as the outer is out further. Even with a trim cross chaining puts more stress on the chain and other components and is not as efficient. The question is not about specifically about cross chaining but here is a link. Technical Details and Implications of Cross Chaining Not the question but the smaller rear gears are going to wear the fastest as they share the load across fewer teeth. So go for a larger front ring when you have choice. But still avoid cross chaining (a lot). 

All the deformation where the tire is in contact with the ground is NOT space lost. Only part of the deformation represents space lost. If I push in a perfectly round balloon it will deform to a different shape. The volume in the balloon will go down and the pressure up. But the decrease in volume is far less then the volume displaced by my hand. Yes a balloon is elastic and will expand. This is true for even an inelastic balloon. Under no load a tire is round. This is not by chance. The tire has a fixed amount of material. The tire will assume a shape that creates the largest volume for a fixed amount of material - a circle. Under the operating range we are examining the circumference of the tire does not change - the tire does not stretch. Under load the tire deforms to a different shape - an ellipse. It is not a perfect ellipse but pretty close. Not all the area displaced by the contact area is lost. For a fixed amount of material an ellipse does not create as much volume. The space lost is circle minus ellipse. The equation volume for the of a circle is: π r² Since the circumference (material) of the tire is constant should use circumference c c²/4π The equation for the volume of an ellipse is π r1 r2 The circumference (perimeter) of an ellipse is complex so will just assume (r1 + r2)/2 = r Assume under load the tire displaces to r2 = 2r1 at the point of maximum displacement. Height reduced by 1/3 at the maximum point of displacement. The ratio (at maximum point of displacement) is: π r1 r2 / π r² r1 r2 / r² r1 * 2r1 / ((r1 + 2r1)/2)² 2 r1² / (3r1 / 2)² 2 r1² / r1² * (3/2)² 2 / (3/2)² 2 / (3² / 2²) 2 * 2² / 3² 8 / 9 So roughly a 10% loss of volume at the point of maximum displacement. Over the length of the patch with ground a (nominal) average of 17 / 18. For r2 = 2 r1 the length of the patch with the ground is about 2 r On a 700 / 25 ( 50*17/18 + (700π - 50) ) / 700π (700π - 50 (1 - 17/18) ) / 700π (700π - 50/18) / 700π 1 - (50 / (18 * 700π)) 1 - .001263 .998738 Pressure increases inversely to volume So a pressure increase of 1.001264729 00.13% Lets look at a patch of 50mm X 25mm 5*2.5 / (2.54)² * 100 psi = 193 lb If I put 200 lbs on a 700 X 25 at 100 psi that patch size and height reduced by 1/3 seems about right. A 200 pound force increasing pressure by 00.12% seems about right. I realize I Moz looks at it from all the displacement is lost. If only part of the displacement is lost then the my number should be smaller than his. I did not review his math. Not trying to prove him wrong - this is just how I look at it. 

Use the regular end when you can come in straight for more contact area Even straight on I will use the round end when the bolt is loose as it is faster - you don't have to be perfectly straight on 

Most likely it is drag in the free hub / freewheel. You can start with breaking it down and cleaning it and lubricating. There are videos on YouTube. Saw the update to the question. Does the freewheel spin freely. Of the bike if you spin it will it make 3+ revolutions. What is all the brown stuff? Clean and lube in general. 

Heating the pedal is not going to help here. Cool the pedal might. But if the hex is stripped too late. Use penetrating oil like Liquid Wrench over WD40 for this. I would have soaked it two days in penetrating oil before I went brute force. The risk of brute force is you that you strip out the crank. Use a drill press as it is really hard to center by hand. If you get the bit big enough it will fracture the pedal axle. But you don't want the bit big enough to scar the crank. I would see if you can get the pedal part of the pedal off and have enough of the axle to grab on to with a pipe wrench. Soak it for 2 days in penetrating oil before you go at it with a pipe wrench. 

A bike from a manufacturer will (typically) have a build kit and seller should not deviate from that. If they are subbing parts then that is just plain wrong. But what you might get is a prior year that did not have as good of components. Or before a frame construction improvement. Or a model number / name that is downgraded components that you might not have picked up on. On the Internet you will see these moved at good prices. You just need to ask the right questions. A LBS is more likely to be up front with this is a last years model. You should look for posted build kit and if it says component may be subbed then ask them straight up what components are on the bike you are selling. Your three links are all shipping. I would go Amazon just because I know they have an excellent return policy. That is a lower end bike and is going to have lower end parts. None of those links even state a specific build kit. If it just says Shimano you need to be prepared for the cheapest Shimano. I would check for sales at you LBS. 

I would more suspect a leaking valve. If you pinch the tube putting it in then it is typically not a slow leak. If the valve is removable the pull it and look for any debris or defect on the seat. I had a set of cheap tubes that had like 1/2 loose valves. Remove it with pressure in the tire to blow out debris you cannot get to. 

First choice is flat or drop bars Flat bars Mountain bike style bars. A more upright position. Comfortable and agile but not very aerodynamic. The single position is fatiguing on long rides. Drop bars Road style bars. A variety of positions to spread fatigue and deal with head winds. The distance between the seat and the bars and the height of the bars affects riding position. The factors there are top tube length, seat position, and bar position. I prefer drop bars for commuting (anything on the street). For commuting you don't want an extreme inclined position. Like a touring or cyclocross bike. My favorite commuter and riding position is my Salsa Vaya. They added a new hand position with a nub on the hoods. How To Hold Your Handlebars Like A Pro You can change handle bar position by moving the spacers, flipping stem up or down, or changing out the stem. And you can rotate the handle bars. Go to a good bike shop that is willing to take the time to help you select a bike and fit (adjust) the bike for you. And don't be afraid to tweak the set up yourself as you get more time on the bike. And air the tires at least once a week. 

44c versus 45c is not enough to worry about. You can use it. Not that you would need to do this but after you have stretched it you should not try and put it in a 35c as it would be hard to do so without a fold in the tube. 

A smaller piece of glass in which both tires deform and touch ground around the glass the softer (lower pressure) tire is always going to have more tire on ground around the glass and take more weight off the glass. The large tire is going to take enough weight off the glass to avoid penetration for a range of heights and sharpness. This is not an artificial condition. A glass bottle is about 4 mm thick. The small sharp shards of glass from the bottle are 4 mm. Even a piece of glass that penetrates both tires the glass will penetrate the harder (higher pressure) tire further. Because of deformation the glass will not be pushed in all the way. Again the softer tire has more deformation. So could have a case where the glass penetrates the tube on the hard tire but not the softer. If you ride the same piece of glass long enough it will eventually works its way into both tires. So inspect your tires for glass. On a regular basis. For sure every time you air them. Tire Pressure Tire pressure effects both pinch and puncture flats (and rolling resistance). Increase pressure reduces pinch flats. Increased pressure increases puncture flats because the tires does not deform as much (spread the load). So there is a sweet spot. Go with the manufacturer for that sweet spot. Tire will have a pressure range. If you weigh 180 of more then use the maximum. If you wight 140 of less then use the minimum. In between use liner interpolation. If you weigh 160 you are 1/2 between and should use the pressure 1/2 way between. Mountain bikers like to run at lower pressure for more contact (traction) and to absorb roots and rocks. If you are running at a lower pressure then be aware and don't bang on roots and rocks as hard. Tubeless Tubeless tires offer the advantage of no tube to pinch so no pinch flats. Can run them at a lower pressure. A tubeless tires with sealant is not less susceptible to a puncture flat but it will seal small punctures.
