I do not know exactly what kind of story you want to build, but as others said, the chance of success is so small that it cannot seriously be taken into account. If you want a more credible story I would suggest that you modify it to something like: 

I don't know about anything else, but you would need genetic engineers to modify the humans that land there. Radius twice the size of earth would mean a mass tens of times bigger then Earths (I am to lazy to calculate now), and a gravitational acceleration significantly bigger than Earths. Also, the atmosphere would be very thick, people could not breathe that air. Actually I think that at this mass, the planet would be to heavy to be considered a rocky planet, and it would be a gas giant (a little on at that). As such, the humans could not survive there. But if it would not be a gas giant, if they would first go to the moon, set up there, build up a larger colony and then they would genetically alter themselves they could go on the planet next. So for this genetic manipulation you would need genetic engineers. And there is another problem. Normally you would send a ship with a lot of resources first if you go a short distance like to Mars, then a colony ship with only what is needed for traveling safely. This because you can wait to see that the first ship got there safe, the load was not damaged and the people have the equipment. If it fails you just send another ship with equipment. That way you don't risk the lives of the people with some extra heavy ship in one round. This is what happens with the ISS now, we don't send extra heavy rockets with all that the astronauts would need for the entire period with them, there is a stash there and it is constantly replenished by unmanned missions (which are safer in term of potential human loss). This makes your scenario more improbable, as the ship would not carry enough equipment. You would send such a complete ship only if it goes a long distance (to another system). 

Establish an electricity supply. This can be hydro power, coal, gas or even wood and chaff powered. This will allow a whole host of technologies that will make your people richer, stronger and more secure. Establish outposts with radio access. This can be done either by scavenging and repurposing old radios from police and army bases, or by building primitive ones from leftover copper wire and primitive batteries. This will allow the towns to be in radio contact and prevent the raiders any chance at surprise. As an added bonus this might help you contact and recruit some of the (hundreds of?) thousands of hunter-gatherer survivalists that might still have working crank-based radio transmitters/receivers in their remote cabins. Establish a united authority. The extent of this will greatly depend on your surviving population density. Without heavy industry (which you won't have for a while) the effective transport range is rather limited by bikes, converted diesel trucks that run on impure oil and horses. Large scale maintenance (highway infrastructure) is out of the question. This can be done by conquest, but most people will still remember and long for the old national states, so the state-building indoctrination does not have to start from zero, so you could have states voluntarily form. This will allow a limited degree of specialization. Start dedicating surplus resources to education and medical infrastructure, before the generation of people with the engineering and medical knowledge is lost, and before damage to extant libraries renders all materials there unreadable. Create the rudiments of an industrial infrastructure. Again, depending on how much of the existing infrastructure you can reuse, you can do a lot of automation, even with relatively primitive electric control systems (mind you i said electric, not electronic). Mining, refining and metal-casting and plastic-casting could then commence. Weapon manufacturing will definitely be a priority. Perhaps even very basic electronics could be in range. Breed like rabbits. Goes without saying, and the motivations of survivors of the calamity will probably be similar to those of Nazi concentration camp survivors. Probably will result in a few centuries of patriarchal domination, but it's the lesser evil. As @MarchHo comments below, your people (if few enough) may need to set up a system to avoid future inbreeding. 

Obviously, the hindsight times given above are merely representative: seers can look reasonably far into the past, or not really. Let's go through these scenarios briefly: Many Seers / Average can look > 1 day, week, month into the past In this case, there probably won't be much premeditated crime. The reason for this is that if the seers can look that far back into the past, then I disagree with the vast majority of problems raised by other answers. Seers don't need to identify the perpetrator (whether or not they are wearing a mask), since they can just follow the perpetrator back in time to their home or forwards in time to their current position (if hindsight is fixed to the seer's current position, the seer can just go "ok, the perpetrator went around that corner", walk to the corner, activate hindsight once again, and repeat the process until they're at the criminal's doorstep). Kidnappings are also not an issue: start at the victim's last known location and trace their steps to the kidnapping and all the way to their present location. The only such crimes would be committed either by untouchables (judge's son, as others have mentioned) or people who have really dedicated themselves to pull it off: moved out of their house into a hotel with a fake name and lived there for 2 days/weeks/months in order to avoid being identified by seers hindsight-walking to their homes, committed the crime, and then made a hasty getaway out of the country, where the seers can't follow them to their current location. Sometime later, they can come back home. There is another possibility when dealing with not-so-long-ago hindsight (a day, for example): poison. If the criminal has access to slow-acting poison, they can use it without fear of the seers, since the seers won't be able to see who poisoned the victim. Few Seers / Average can look > 1 day, week, month into the past In this case, the seers will be stretched thin and won't be able to investigate every crime. They will probably be put in a taskforce of sorts, focusing on high profile or otherwise important crimes. Therefore, lower level crime will still exist for the most part, while high profile crimes will probably be very few and far between, or have to be aided with magic to shield the perpetrators from hindsight. The exceptions are mostly the same as in the previous section. Indeed, in this case, poison becomes especially handy: you can use a relatively short-acting poison so long as its symptoms can be confused with accidental or natural deaths (causes a heart attack, for instance). With few hindsight seers, the police will have a good chance of simply assuming it was a natural/accidental death and move on. Meanwhile, if there were many seers, the police might have seers do a cursory look into the victim's past just to check for such foul-play. Many Seers / Average can look < 1 hour into the past There probably won't be much petty crime, especially in areas near police stations. However, high profile crime probably won't be much affected, since these tend to be at least a bit thought through. If all you need to do is get an hour's head start on the police, anyone with even a modicum of discipline can probably do it. Kidnappings will probably not be affected either, since you probably can't follow the victim's footsteps in time. Few Seers / Average can look < 1 hour into the past In this case, the seers probably won't have much of an impact. They won't be able to stop serious crime and there aren't enough of them to make a dent on petty crime either. 

Well, whatever the broadband rate X might be, the physical storage medium might hold $(10,000\times X)^2$ of information, making it unwieldy to transfer by streaming connection in a reasonable time. Now as to why it is being used, it could contain something very personally valuable, like an encrypted blockchain hash of your personal wallet, or a full upload copy of your domestic partner's latest mindstate. 

If humans were to vanish completely from the Earth rapture-style, other primates would possibly slowly evolve and eventually take our place (in a few million years?), since they have both the basic cognitive architecture and similar manipulators that could evolve to allow finer motor control more easily, compared to a dog's brain and front paws. I have seen other non-primate animals use tools, such as ravens using tools to get tools to get food. And there are other types of manipulators even here on earth (jaws, beaks, claws, tentacles, trunks). Heck, Koalas even have two thumbs per hand. To me, however, it seems like there's a catch - literally, in that the human hand might just be the most precise and versatile environmental manipulator (relative to our size) that has ever evolved here on Earth. It allows multifunctionality, power, precision, and sustained use, which would be my criteria of choice for comparisons. So here's a question for the more biologically and mechanically inclined among Worldbuilders: Could other solutions solve the difficult problem of grasping (holding, scooping, throwing, etc.) without the same adaptation? In other words, can claws, jaws, tentacles, beaks or trunks do the job (of building tools, fire and a civilization) as well as a hand or is there something vital that's missing in those manipulators? To give two specific examples, would evolved elephants or some land-adapted octopi be able to achieve the kind of motor control we enjoy? This will be useful in refining the degree of convergent evolution that needs to take place in my alien/abandoned-earth worlds... 

The study is not so much of magic, but of the student by the teachers The Wheel Group of powerful witches and warlocks is a conservative bunch (in the sense that they are stingy with the energy used by the nanite network, and in that they wish to maintain the Earth's geological, geographical, political and social status-quo -- i.e. like the continents to stay where they are and so forth). They cannot afford loose cannons, users who would act recklessly or attempt massive magical effects for no good reason. Therefore candidates are quickly identified and placed under careful observation, whereby exhibiting personality traits like megalomania, impulsivity, quick to anger and such will either disqualify a candidate altogether (a usually lethal cleansing process), or severely limit their nanite network privilege levels. Having dedicated study areas also ensures that effects (fires, highly energetic discharges, spatio-temporal warpings and the like) are caused under the observation of higher-privilege users who can usually control and turn off accidental reverberating chain reactions, making the learning process safer for students and physical reality alike. Since the neural firing patterns are unique to each individual, trainees are assigned to teachers who have similar subjective control experiences, but the experience is rarely if ever directly translatable. A good teacher looks for the correlates of better effect triggers and helps the trainee tune that particular state, but there are no textbooks or classical exercises to speak of, and great care must be taken, as effects can be unpredictable. The mage must grow unto their power, aka train their neural net to interact with the lace to produce desired effect, much like the monkey in the image above getting the treat. A bit of context for the answer The reasoning here is simple (well, as magic systems go). It is 1000 years later, and mankind has seen the horrors of the Greater Abomination Wars, when sentient AIs wielding nanotech ruined much of the technological civilization on Earth before being put down. Various artifacts, including the ever-pervasive cloud of self-replicating nanites are actually still very much part of the Earth's ecosystem, still powered by the massive energy drive that the late Em civilization had built in the outer surface of the sun. The Returned Buffetti and Lasting Muskian lineages (thought to be descendants of powerful men in the Abomination Crisis age, although records were long lost) have the embedded genetic markers that, when detected in a new-born, cause the controller nanites to attach to pre-designated portions of their neo-cortex. Over the centuries since, there seems to have been some degree of both genetic drift in the markers and some replication-error-induced random walk in the core nanite programming (the net effect is a partial match causing a malformed hard to control lace to form, or more worrisome laces that don't respond well to Wheel control algorithms). Subjectively, the Muskians and Buffetti witches and warlocks grow up hearing voices, and causing small random effects, as the nanite system begins to interact with their wetware (human neural net). The wiring pattern is too complex to be completely described in the nanite programming, so, just like the wiring of the natural human brain, a chaotic-fractal pattern is used instead, causing each wiring diagram to be effectively unique, except in the broad outlines. At some point (usually by the age of 8) the integration is physically complete and waiting for the activation key and wheel rank assignment to penetrate conscious awareness. Post-activation and privilege level setting, objective effects in reality are triggered by firing patterns from the individual. The nature of the subjective firing experience varies dramatically. Descriptions of it range from "solving differential equations in one's head", to "dancing patterns in my second body", "having sex with a luminous entity", "picking symbols from a lit-up canvas in my head", with the difficulty of the interactions corresponding to different ability levels by each witch and warlock. 

Do you actually need it to be very deep underwater? If you just want it to be hard to find, you can place it in remote shallow water (well, not really shallow, but something like 100 meters deep). Somewhere near Greenland, or Antarctica would work, if you want to place it firm on the bottom. It's not like there are millions of scuba divers in these places. It might be better not to complicate the story with unnecessarily fantastical elements. Also take into consideration that you are underwater, so you need an earthquake inactive area if you build on the seabed. 

I think it is impossible for a planet to develop only one life form. If we look at earth the entire planet has a sort of balance, where the development of one form life is stopped by another, none of them getting to be fully disruptive. From this balance the competition emerges, and intelligence at some point evolves. Of course once humans evolved and we got very intelligent compared to all other life forms, we got to a point where our population dictates the balance. But absent the competition there is no need for intelligence (which is costly from an evolutionary point of view), so your aliens would not think anything of the actions of humans because they would be unable to think (that if they could evolve like this, but I doubt they could). 

I do not see how life would survive the explosion, but depending on how spread the pieces are, a civilization could colonize the remains after they cool down. Problem is that if you take a planet like earth, and destroy it, none of the resulting pieces would be big enough to sustain an atmosphere and life. You could have a very big initial planet (like near the maximum theoretical for a rocky planet) that gets destroyed but the civilization present there goes somewhere else in that star's system and they come back later, when the pieces get together. But it would be millions of years at least in between the event and the return and the parts would resemble a planet and its satellites. Theoretically you could have some binary planets resulting from the initial ones destruction and each may have a few moons, so you could have a complex system, but it would still not be just rocks moving around in an orbit. Also to note that while binary planets are theoretically possible, from what I know there is no such system observed to date. But you are talking about planet sized destructive capacities, so maybe the targeted civilization would also in turn have some planet powerful gravitational changing devices? If so, of course they would still not survive on the planet during the attack, but they might be able to speed up the planet reshaping process, if enough would survive on spaceships, colonies on other planets in the system etc. Gravitationally push the former planets mass together again, or lets say it is spread too much, but they can make pockets of matter compress and such create something like what i wrote before, a binary system with some moons. Bring water from asteroids, remake the atmosphere by taking from other planets in the system etc. 

Aging is a complex and barely understood process. While some animals have lifespans of centuries, others live for mere months. It is unclear why. We know that what we call aging involves multiple cross-linked systems. Here's De Grey's breakdown of different types of aging damage from SENS: 

Let's move on to the part where the atmosphere is 20% oxygen when there's lots of hydrogen (30%). No, no, no. Oxygen is a reducing gas. The atmosphere would ignite given the first spark (say caused by lightning). Pure hydrogen-oxygen flames are so energetic they emit light in the UV spectrum. Your whole atmosphere would go down like the Hindenburg. 

The implications of this relentless progress in the most scarce resource of all, namely intelligence, are surely vast yet their true scale and the new vantage points sure to be opened by them remain unfathomable. Even a marginally human-like special-purpose artificial intellect would change everything, probably more so than all the previous revolutions combined. So, even on the path to K-I, there are gamechanging future technologies that we have visibility of, such as fusion power, competent dedicated as well as general purpose AIs, and full-blown nanotechnology. All three are massive game-changers in the energy, knowledge and manufacturing dimensions, which might help explain their relatively easy visibility from our vantage. There are sure to be countless others that remain invisible, some among them gamechangers. None of these technologies are literally required for attaining Kardashev-I (as the OP mentions, in theory we could reach it with something much like current technology), but it is extremely unlikely that with massive boosts in available energy and the new vantages that opens such innovations will not be pursued, as they will appear as low-hanging fruit in that new context. Having been pursued, they will open a virtuous cycle of making new gains in energy harvesting possible, better computation etc., in turn making yet other potential technologies appear as low hanging fruit, and so ad infinitum or until the marginal rate of return becomes 0. 

First, you'll be drinking the Beepiss Cocktail. BPS stands for body positioning system. There is no need to make this drink glow an eerie blue color, but you can bet that all of them will be glowy and blue, just for effect. These are tiny transmitting bots whose purpose is to spread right around the body and create a body plan. We'll give it an hour to take full effect. Feel free to mix it up with some flavored vodka (you look like you'd drink your vodka flavored, don't you? I knew it!), cause the next part's gonna hurt. The next one to go down is the Bubble Tea. This one's gonna be nasty. Those round jellies at the bottom will stick to your intestinal lining, and dig through it, spilling their powerful cargo into your body. Their contents are sesame to poppy seed sized little bots that will literally migrate through your body to BPS-specified locations and deliver their scaffolding and stem-cell cargo there. Over the next few days, these will build into the electric batteries and get those new neuron connections going, by BPS, all the way up to your brainstem. If it'll feel like you got ants running through your veins, it's because you will. Meanwhile, the now empty bubble tea jelly will use itself to patch all those tiny wholes in your intestinal lining. Don't worry too much, there's a fair bit of pain-killer in this brew. Finally, you gotta gulp down the Genejack Cocktail, this is the big'un, and we're saving it for late in the evening. We asked the lab-techs to make it rainbow colored, but the head honcho there's a no-nonsense kind of lass, so this last one looks disappointingly like a glass of water. Don't be fooled, though. This is the most serious stuff. It's gotta take into account your, what is it, 25 years of misdeeds, epigenetic instructions, vagaries of intra-uterine development, not to mention the 20Mb of genecode that needs to be altered, trillions of times. Then there's the whatchamacallit, uh, the protein cascades of interactions, and the ton of ways they can gunk up your other existing cascades and kill'ya right dead. Deader than a door-knob, that is. Don't worry, these guys and gals are wicked smart. The resulting genecode package is nothing like the original eel's, I hear, but a whole brave new synthetic code. Oh, and before I forget: this'll leave a hell of a hangover: It'll be like a week of the worst flu you ever had, before it's all sorted out. Get yourself plenty of chicken soup and napkins.
