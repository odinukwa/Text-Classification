Your client’s staff still have to do their day job, just because someone has called you in to do a project does not mean any of the client’s staff have been told what work they can drop, so as to be able to help you. There is often a high level of resentment of past consultants that have taken the work that the client’s staff have done, and presented it as their own work. While at the same time the management refuses to ask their own staff the same questions directly. Remember you may have chosen to work 15hr days to get your next report in on time, but you can’t expect someone on normal salary to drop everything in their life just so you can do so. I have seen too many cases in the public sector in the UK, when a consultants will be called that costs £100K to do work, that could have been done in house if the people with the real understanding where resourced better so they were not at 100% capacity all the time. When it can take close to one year to get approval to bring in a £20K admin person, but the management has no problem finding the money for you, how can you expect any of the staff to respect what you are doing? So you need to find out how you can make the clients staff look good and feel better about their jobs, then do it. 

Sounds like you would only take this other job if it has all (most) of the pros of your current one, and none (few) of the cons. Fair enough. You could put it exactly like that, then explain why you mostly really like your job, and then give the few things that you don't like. I think this won't go over very well, the interviewer might get confused and assume you basically like your job and don't want to leave. Instead don't talk too much about your current job and focus on expectations. There are nice things about your current job that you like and don't want to give up. Okay, make a list of these. Say, 5 that are most important to you, or whatever number you think. There are things that are not so nice, like the commute, that you want to escape. Okay, make a list of these also. Combine both lists. That's your list of things to ask the interviewer about. When asking, disregard whether your current job satisfies each point - simply ask it as a desired feature of your potential new job offer. Then your situation is like any normal job-seeker with a list of things they want from their job, and a list of skills and abilities they can contribute in return. Sounding sufficiently interested shouldn't be a big problem. After the interview is over you can decide based on what they say. If you like their answer to all of them, the job is clearly better than your old one. If the answer to all are bad, it's clearly worse. If only some are good, then fill out your checklist for the current job also, compare, see which one sounds better to you. 

Companies are mostly looking to see that you have written a lot of code (many weeks to produce one program, not a few hrs like most university course work.), ideally working in a team with other people on a real problem. Failing that contributing to open source projects is a 2nd best. Your internships should put you in good standing if you wrote a lot of code on them. To rise above male colleagues, you can stand out by showing basic social skills like looking people in the eye when talking to them, provided you are good as the technical side. I believe the real issue is that women tend to underrate their own skills, when men tend to overrate them and other people tent to rate you as you rate yourself. 

Reporting in sick must be easy and quick. I have worked for companies that require you to PHONE in and SPEAK to your manager, that can take 30 minutes on the phone if someone has to go to find the manager. It also has to be done at a time when the manger is at work – not good if someone wakes up sick at 6am and knows that are not fit to go into work that day. Therefore allow email and/or txt to be used. Never say anything negative to someone that reports in sick, they are helping you by doing so. Don’t question if the sickness is real etc. Leave all the questioning until the person is better, or let HR contact them after a few days. (Remember some people don't have a phone line or mobile coverage at home, there are even people without internet access at home.) 

There's not inherently wrong with working discreetly. There are many areas where it is preferable for everyone involved that not every single detail of the work be made public to everyone. From what you've written, it appears that they want to save face by secretly starting over on some sub-standard work they've done. IMHO, they should skip the secrecy, and go to the customer and say "we messed up, we're sorry, but we'll rebuild the whole thing and everything will be fine", but that's their business. Again, nothing inherently wrong with this particular assignment either. However: 

Not all companies pay you for how much work you do. For instance, a security guard is not paid per thief he catches, he is paid to be there 8 hours every night so that management can rest easy in the knowledge that there is at least 1 guard present on the premises from 10 pm to 6 am every night. Or a receptionist at the front desk: They are not paid by the number of visitors they help, they are paid by the hour because it is crucial that there always be a receptionist manning the front desk at all times, no matter what, even if nobody shows up. Software development is often a "paid for work" field where the key thing you provide to the company in exchange for your pay is not availability, but completed work. However, this is not always the case. You can tell by the attitude of the company: 

There are a few differences. If someone is currently out of work, and does not have other job offer, the employer does not know if they truly want to take the job, or if they are just taking it due to having no other options, or to keep their unemployment benefit advisor happy. In the UK anyone on benefits has to prove they have put in enough job applications and list all interviews have had, often the benefit advisor will phone up an employer to check how some ones interview went. Therefore don’t expect them to tell you they don’t want to job, or know that they can’t do the job. Likewise it is required that someone takes the first job, even if they know they have another job starting in a few weeks time. On the other hand, no employer likes “letting someone go” within the probation period, but if a person is out of work, the employer can over then a few weeks extended trail, without feeling bad if things don’t work out. 

tl;dr: Ask yourself, is there an amount of money that would make you feel comfortable doing this? If yes, explain your position to them and say, "sorry guys, the initial agreement was for a normal project - if you want this super secret stuff we can do that too but you're paying extra". Either way, be prepared to walk away. Money is nice but this is a lot more risky than your usual job. Ghost writing costs more than normal writing, so if you agree to being paid the same, you're being underpaid. 

If they only care about you showing up, forget it. Show up at the usual time and patiently wait while the crappy laptop wastes 15 minutes of company time. Maybe bring a book to read while you do it or make some coffee in the meanwhile. If management is very strict, work on something else (check your emails on your phone, look at your calendar/agenda) so they can't badger you over it. The company has their own accountants and productivity experts, if they care they will see the inefficiency reflected in their data and independently solve the problem. Maybe they will even ask you if you have suggestions to improve productivity. Let's say you work 40 hours a week and get $30/hour. Let's also pretend that you spend 20 minutes every day, waiting for the reboots and shut downs, so that you could be spending 15 minutes less if you had a modern computer. That means 3% of your 8 hour day is wasted: The company is paying you $240 for the day and getting 97 units of work, whereas they could be getting 100 units instead if they gave you better equipment. Effectively, they're wasting $7. Is that your problem? Hell no. Your job is to show up at the time the contract says, take the tools the contract says they'll give you, do the work the contract says you will and happily take their money. Budget consulting is extra. You could indeed show up early, and make sure they get 100 units of work like you think they expect. However, if you do that, you will also be working 8.25 hours a day, not 8. This means that you are now spending 41.25 hours at work and getting $29 for each of them (maybe there's another company that would have hired you for $29.5?). Technically, it's not breach of contract since no one asked you to do it, but doing it essentially amounts to giving your company a donation in the form of unpaid volunteer labor. Presumably, your contract does not say anything about mandatory unpaid volunteer work (I don't even think it would be legal) so that you are under no obligation to do it. If you know the manager or owner personally, then yes, it's nice to do it, but so would handing him a $100 bill. On the other hand, if you do get paid for work and not time, it's different: Do whatever it takes to complete your part of the project before the deadline (although this isn't matter of ethics, but practicality: You'll get fired if you don't). If you feel you are forced to spend too much time because of this slow booting, then take it up with management. Even if they are not cooperative, consider just buying your own laptop, and then mentally discounting your salary accordingly when you get competing offers from rival companies. Lastly, a tangent: This company is doing software development, they hire you at a rate high enough that even a few minutes of your time can pay for a laptop, and they hand you a potato that takes 15 minutes (!!!) to boot? Sounds like management needs to get a clue. 

If someone has x years of experience doing XYZ and still is seeking another job doing XYZ, then it is reasonable given the above to assume that at least at some level they consider themself good at the job. This fails if they have been working elsewhere when everyone is bad at the job, so they are just a little less bad. For the same reason some companies will not make a job offer until they know that the candidate has offers from elsewhere, as they never will to take on someone that is being “forced” to work for them. 

You work for a USA company, but are working in India. They are effectively using your office as an outsourcing resource for the work they don’t think is important enough to use they own employees on. Even if you work for a “native” company, unless that company does more then provide cheap staff to other companies you will get the same problem. It is well known in the “west” that most India developers cannot produce useful results unless there is a very well defined spec – maintenance tasks tend to have a well defined spec. We used to call code written by the India outsourcing company “yes man” code – as they would never question what they were asked to do, just produce software that was no use to anyone. (Therefore it was best for us, if we somehow stop the management getting them to do anything important.) So you need to work for a company that does not depend on work from outside of India, or work for one of the few western companies that developers complete products in India from concept right though to sale and support. 

The whole aim of your work is to take a project that the customer is not satisfied with, and fix the customer's complaints. Yet you are not allowed to talk to the customer. Fine, c'est la vie. But this will slow you down, therefore the project will take longer than usual, and perhaps the work will be harder (more $$$/hour). So you should discuss pricing again, because assumptions behind your original quote likely no longer hold. With all this secrecy, what proof will even exist of your employment? When you get paid at the end, your tax authority will need to know where your money came from, because large sums out of the blue are often connected to criminal activity. You also need enough legally admissible proof that yes, you are hired by them and yes, you do expect to be paid so much money for rebuilding this app. Their customer needn't see these documents, but they must be prepared between the two of you. Otherwise, they could just not pay you after the work is done, and you couldn't prove in court that you even worked there at all. Or they could pay you, and then the government audits your taxes, and you have endless headaches explaining to them that it was a "secret project". Secrecy costs money. Bluntly, not all developers have the tact to do such work without blowing their cover, therefore those that can (like you) should be paid more. It's supply and demand. So this is a valuable additional thing that they need to compensate you for, on top of what I mentioned in #1. Last but not least, the payoff of your work is not only the money, but also being able to show future clients your past work to show that you're a capable developer. If they intend to keep it completely secret, they are essentially taking that away from you, so they should give something else in return - like money. Meaning if this will be a secret not only during work, but even long after the app is rebuilt and the customer is happy, then that will cost extra too, on top of #1 and #3.
