Yes, passing through what you called "dark night" is a prerequisite for Enlightenment. The term refers to existential crisis experienced around the time of fully realizing Emptiness and the Three Marks of Existence. In Vajrayana tradition this is also referred to as the death of the ego. As Chogyam Trungpa said, 

In my opinion, one of the best translations is the one in Analayo Bhikhu's "Satipatthana: The Direct Path to Realization". see $URL$ or $URL$ 

In my opinion, it is totally reconcilable. Not just "reconcilable", Buddhism is the best part of Type-A attitude taken to its logical conclusion. If you think about it, Siddhartha himself used to be a typical Type-A person: highly ambitious, driven to success, unhappy with status-quo. In my opinion, the more a Type A person optimizes his or her behavior to achieve their own definition of success, the more they will look like an enlightened Buddhist. And vice versa, the more a Buddhist realizes the teaching in practice, the more they will behave like a (purified, enlightened version of) a good business leader - strong, happy, confident. Per my live teachers, non-attachment in Buddhism IS NOT cultivation of meekness. It is cultivation of unsinkable optimism and wise flexibility of mind. (Mahayana) Buddhism is not against achievements either, it just offers the ultimate, more meaningful Achievement for those who are up to the challenge. My teacher said, this world is a perfect gym to train our Enlightened Mind qualities, so take it as such. Buddhism may be at odds with small-minded, egoistic, fearful, greedy, aggressive attitude of some people - but these attitudes are not approved by the modern civil society either. So we are in complete sync with the spirit of times, I think - and should not be afraid to expose our Buddhist values to the public. IMO to be an open Buddhist would be beneficial for society these days. 

As I understand, five skandhas describe phenomenological (first-person-view) makeup of a sentient being's world: 

So doubt must be natural to be real. That's why even though Master Hakuin is right in listing it as one of three essential things, I now say it is secondary to paying attention properly, taking note of facts and how they fit together or not. 

Space (akasha) is one of those dharmas that were debated by Early Buddhist schools. Some counted space as an unconditioned dharma along with Nirvana, and some did not. If I remember correctly, Theravada does not, and most other early schools did consider space unconditioned. Then within that, there was argument whether a certain dharma can perform a function (whether its "real" or not - being able to participate in causal chains was considered an important characteristic, which later was denied equivalency with ultimate existence - things can perform function even though they are empty of real existence). This argument included akasha, some said it can cause results and some said it can't. Some said akasha is only an absence of objects etc. All this messy debating about dharmas, in my opinion, is what led to eventual emergence and popularization of Emptiness philosophy and praxis of prajnaparamita. Declaring all dharmas to be mere conceptual designations/imputations, was an elegant way out of endless debates. I do not remember who specifically spoke about "whole" vs "parts" but there was a line of analysis that was born somewhere in the period between Abhidharma and Madhyamaka, that showed that all spatial entities are designations, because they have "sides" (left/right/top/down) - and since they can be subdivided, they are therefore constructed, therefore are generalizations attached to a construct, hence not real. You find this point still cited in various Tibetan commentaries explaining the various facets of Emptiness. Sorry, nothing specific here, hope it helps at all. 

Quoting from "Treasury of Precious Qualities" by Jigme Lingpa, with commentary by Longchen Yeshe Dorje, Kangyur Rinpoche, with a foreword by H.H. the Dalai Lama: 

(A Mahayana explanation:) Lobha -- The opposite of is apparently generosity. Is this right? In my opinion, this is not accurate. The opposite of is dispassion, equanimity - the feeling that you can be happy with whatever you have. In my understanding, is not as much miserliness or tendency to keep things to oneself -- as it is a feeling of lacking something, having some sort of emotional hole -- that one then tries to fill with all sorts of objects, projects, and experiences. This emotional hole then manifests as all kinds of impulsive desires and obsessions. Generosity is an antidote to lobha, not it's "opposite". The way it works IMO, is when you give something to others, your emotional mind starts feeling that since you're giving - you therefore must be having an abundance of something that others don't have - and that feeling of abundance leads to (partial) healing of the emotional hole of neediness. This is an example of idappaccayata at work. --...to make a good impression on others? -- correct, craving for praise is a manifestation of . -- enjoyment of nice pleasant weather or tasty food, and the desire that it should continue further? -- I don't think this is an example of . At the moment of enjoyment you don't normally have what we call "desire". You may have lingering fear of it eventually running out - that's a manifestation of . Once it stops, you may have nostalgia and craving for it to come back - that's a manifestation of . --looking at a good-looking person and desiring to go and talk to them? -- correct, this is a manifestation of , you feeling a need for a positive experience. --What about feeling happy when being praised by others? -- feeling happy in and of itself is not . It's when we crave for an external source of satisfaction, since we lost touch with our own. Seeking praise yes, that's from . Dosa --The opposite of is apparently loving-kindness (metta or maitri). Is this right? Again, is an antidote to , not it's opposite. The opposite of is equanimity or wise acceptance. --anger that results in the act of killing or injuring others - IMO anger is a manifestation of , not an example of it. is an emotional negativity, or emotional irritability, a deep lying attitude that "this is all wrong". (I suppose it comes from some sort of unconscious attachment to an impossible ideal of external perfection. If is about being deeply unhappy with oneself because of not having been loved enough, is about being deeply unhappy with the world, because of having lost the object of one's love.) -- the dislike of unpleasant weather (too hot and humid, or too cold) -- if you feel that bad weather is "wrong", like it's a corruption of good weather - that's from ; if you feel that you're missing the positive emotions that come from good weather - that's from . -- the dislike of minor physical pain and wishing that it goes away? -- correct, any feeling that something "should not be" because it's "not right" or "not supposed to be this way" - is from . -- judging others in your mind for their perceived flaws? -- definitely comes from . -- being impatient because your friend is late to meet you for dinner? -- if in your mind you are mostly craving to have that dinner faster - that comes from , if you are angry at your friend for being late - that comes from . -- feeling displeased because you were criticized by others? -- in my opinion this is from . Being criticized is a type of rejection, and being vulnerable to rejection comes from . Now, if you are also angry at them, because you think they are wrong - that part is from 'dosa'. 

"Majjhima Nikaya: The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha" translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi. Easy-to-read selection of suttas in a nice printed form. 

Wrathful Buddhas (or wrathful gurus for that matter) are not actually angry, in the way untrained people are. In Vajrayana before we even reach highest tantra, we learn to transmute emotions. If you are not good at it yet, at the very least you should be able to transmute anger into headache. Once you reach some mastery though, you can transmute any emotion into pure energy. When you have direct insight into the nature of mind, emptiness, attachments, and emotions - you can ride a wave of energy and even display wrath (an appearance of anger) without really taking it seriously. This is then used as a tool in those cases that demand such approach. Like getting angry at kids, you are half faking it, half letting yourself get carried by anger - to add your show more weight. 

This, combined with the literal meaning of the word "samsara" - "running by itself", "drifting" can point us in the right direction. Samsara is endless unless we put an end to it (nirodha). And how do we put an end to it? By applying the principle of this/that-conditionality and undoing the 2nd noble truth, i.e. by accepting what is and arriving at tathata. Now technically, what we accept is not really Samsara as it is, that would be surrendering. Instead, we learn to see Shunyata and that's what we accept, Samsara-as-Shunyata. Does not mean that Samsara has gone anywhere though, it is still endless as it always were. In fact, if we want to help other sentiment beings, we have to deal with Samsara every day. 

It takes a long time because we have some deeply lying conceptual mistakes about reality, due to which we have accumulated much emotional baggage rooted in those conceptual mistakes, and on top of that we tend to actively fight it when anyone tries to show us our mistakes and delusions. We have all these explanations and rationalizations that we cling to, and they are connected with events in our personal lives, providing support and sustenance to delusion. It's like a tangle of hair made from wrong concepts, emotions, and karma - very difficult to untangle. 

Sensual desire means desire for pleasure. Acting out of desire for pleasure is wrong motivation. The right motivation is to act out of knowledge of how things work, with clear understanding of the results and the alternatives. That's very different than acting for pleasure, that's informed, functional action. In the example with food, we eat to sustain the body and spirit. In the example with clothes, we put them on to protect from cold, insects, for social reasons etc. See the difference? We act with a purpose, not for pleasure. So it's not about eliminating desires, it's about changing your modus operandi from impulse driven, to deliberate. Regarding sensual restraint, the idea is to protect yourself from influences that stimulate impulses and obsessions (e.g. advertising, erotic, hate-provoking influences etc). This is done by being selective about what you attend to, what you allow to enter into your stream of consciousness. Another problem with obsessive desires (whether sensual or otherwise), is the resulting mismatch between "is" and "should" which generates dukkha, the mind of suffering. Depending on the goal, this suffering may be a worthwhile price to pay for the motivation to get there, you just have to understand that mental suffering comes as inevitable side-effect. But certainly sensual pleasure is almost never the right goal and is not worth the suffering. 

Now, some schools of Buddhism, such as Zen and some lineages of Nyingma, do not really emphasize philosophical analysis of Emptiness. Instead, they get you to an intuitive vision of the same, through practical examples in one's immediate life. So in the traditional Buddhism, Madhyamaka had its niche as special medicine for intellectual types. However, the world nowadays is a lot more sophisticated than it was ~2600 years ago, or even just 200 years ago. We live in a realm of concepts to a lot greater degree than we used to back in the Buddha's times. So not understanding the major flaw and danger of the deepest perceptual/interpretative assumptions that our entire civilization is built upon, puts us in a very weak position as far as getting deluded and losing the way. So in my opinion, solid understanding of Emptiness is a broad requirement in this new era, critical for helping the common people not just be less attached and more open-minded, but most importantly to obtain a much needed immunity to manipulations by non-human forms of existence - the conflict of interests that is only beginning to unfold. 

According to Kagyu understanding, Yogacara's position isn't metaphysical, it is methodological. It's not that the external world does not exist, it is that our experience of the world is 100% always represented by organs and/or mind, there is no experience outside of that, so practically speaking mind-made experience is "all we have"* Which is why trying to figure out how exactly the experience is generated and mastering the practical skills for working with mind and experience is of key importance in Yogacara (comparing to the earlier Buddhism's focus on discipline/ethics and the Madhyamika's focus on philosophy). 

In suttas Buddha says this to people feeling remorseful about their past: there is no use worrying about the past you can't change. Focus on acting with skill going forward. One of the most underappreciated techniques in Buddhism is weaving useful narratives. This is when you tell yourself a story about yourself in a way that induces and sustains the good states of mind. The story can't be a lie though! -- so before you can do it, you have to actually repent/reconcile/resolve to not let it happen again. So the first step is to actually finalize the internal decision: what shall you do differently from now on. Then you should let some time pass to give you a chance to act in the new way. And then you can say hey, I have not committed the same mistake for such and such time, I think I am good now. Simple, right? Check out the story about Angulimala and a Pregnant Woman. It illustrates this principle brilliantly. 

They say Buddha's mind is incomprehensible. It is impossible to understand Buddha's perspective or motives, because it's beyond any fixed position. Chogyam Trungpa said, enlightened mind sees everything from all possible angles, "like a lawyer". I guess you could call that quantum vision or multidimensional mind. Because of this, it's really impossible to give one answer to "why does a buddha try to help others?". There are many reasons, but at the end of the day the answer is: "because Buddha is Buddha and this is what Buddha does, by definition" 

Prefix is a simple negation. Hindu concept of Atman should not be confused with Aham (the simple reflexive "I", "ego" or "self") nor with Jiva (the vitality that makes an animate being an animate being). Atman means "inner spirit" or "core" and refers to what is supposedly the unchanging subject of experience, also known as "The Knower of the Field" (Purusha), and the source of its own activity. Basically, Atman is that fictitious little boss that sits in our head, looks through our eyes and decides what to do. Pali ending of often corresponds to English : 

There are two parts to karma: 1) external forces/energies you set in motion with your action and 2) latent tendencies and inclinations in your psyche - that later become your action and reaction, that then sets external forces in motion. If you step away and look at it from a distance, there is really no hard line between "external" and "internal"; karma is a network of subtle potentialities. Some of the potentialities are pretty subtle, yeah - like the ones involved in playing videogames - but they are still real. Very few of them translate 1:1 to analogous actions in real life though. For example, mass-shooting in games is not even remotely the same karma as real murder, but you still separate "yourself" from "others", and you still desire good for one's own character at the expense of everyone else's. Amassing golden coins in game is not real, but you still go after "fruits", get frustrated when things you like a taken away and so on and so forth. Guess what kind of latent potentialities, however subtle, all this creates/reinforces? Actually, when it comes to karma, "subtle" does not mean "weak". Some of our deepest hung-ups come from our subtlest preconceptions. So I'd say in general the games you play may not create a lot of new karma, but they certainly reinforce your inner tendencies and preconceptions that keep you chained in samsara.
