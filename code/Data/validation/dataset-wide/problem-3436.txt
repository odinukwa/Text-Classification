I guess you are referring to a situation in which abundand supply of high-skilled workers decrease productivity such that individual ? Considering Equation (5) in Acemoglu & Autor, and capture supply of both groups of workers. If becomes sufficiently high, I don't see why the relation between both wages should not become lower than 1. 

These are not two densities, but one density defined on the interval $[0,1.2]$, taking two different values. The average income is then the integral of the density function, i.e. $$ \int_0^{0.5} 1 x \, dx + \int_{0.5}^{1.25} \frac{2}{3} x \, dx = \frac{9}{16} = 0.5625 $$ In order to obtain the average income, you do the same with the Utility and $\bar{z} = \frac{9}{16}$. 

Concering the actual 'tax tariff', there is a huge difference between those two. Income taxation usually feature lots of deductions and a progressive tariff, while deductions for payroll taxes are very limited. Beyond, payroll taxes are often defined by a fixed proportion, possibly with some maximum amount, implying an overall regressive distributional impact. A good overview on income taxes are provided in the regular. OECD Taxing Wages publications. To add to nathanwww's Answer: If payroll taxes are associated with higher pension claims in the future, individuals might rather be willing to pay them. Whether everybody does so (i.e. whether everybody has this foresight) is in my view at least debatable. Beyond, if we talk about contributions to public health insurance, payroll taxes work more like an ordinary income tax. Unlike old-age pensions, the benefit I receive from the health insurance is not related to my payments. 

There are several reasons from supply and demand side. From production side, for example, contrary to anouncement of cutting production (from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Qatar), Saudi Arabia continued to increase its production. (There are some political reasons behind like Saudi Arabia would like to make some pressure on Russia and USA but I don't enter into this discussion as it does not concern an economic mechanism.) Also, there are some other countries like Canada, Iraq and Iran where the oil production rises, which pushes prices to fall. (I think you can easily find some data about that, I have seen somewhere in web.) From demand side, there is a risk of deflation in Europe and contraction of demand in most of developping countries, which also affects production side and could make a downward pressure on energy prices. Another reason could be use of energy efficient technologies (like some cars or machines in some industries.) What theory says about this issue ? In fact, the existing literature on environmental economics says that price of exhaustible resources tends to increase as they become scarce. (it is the famous Hotelling rule) There is a relationship between the use of renewable energies and exhaustible resources. Normally, an economy starts with use of exhaustible resources. Theory says that when economy grows in time, the exhaustible resource becomes scarce and its price increases. In this case, economy will use exhaustible resources until the marginal benefit from its use is equal to price of backstop (solar, wind etc...) (A very interesting paper to see about subject is Withagen and Van der Ploeg (JEEM-2012)) In this current situation, it is sure that there are less incentives for economies to switch to clean technologies as price of exhaustible resources decreased to much. To respond to your question, the use of renewable energy is increasing in world but I don't think at all that the huge fall in oil prices is due to "increasing" use of renewables. This trend for renewables is always present since some decades but until now, oil prices have always increased. As I have tried to explain, I don't really think there are robust correlations between the drop of oil prices and renewable energy use. 

In itself, a price index for single period does not tell you much, as any index is, by definition, without dimension. Assuming that 3.41 is the annual change in the CPI (= Consumer Price Index), this would imply an inflation rate of 3.41%. To be specific, it implies that the total price of a representative commodity basket changed by 3.41%. The WPI (= Wholesale Price Index) covers different commodities and hence yields a different inflation rate. Which one to prefer depends on what you are interested in. Consumer Prices are more relevant to private households, but businesses care about wholesale prices. 

One of the main reasons for the general tendency to run deficits is political economy. Governments are elected for a limited period and try to stay in power by benefiting their electorate. An alternative explanation is that high debts reduce the scope for the subsequent government. So there are good reasons to impose some restrictions to the deficit into the constitution. I find the comparison to big companies misplaced. Governments fulfil different purposes than companies. Many of their 'products' are public goods (public infrastructure, education, defense, social security) which cannot be provided by private actors due to external effects. A strictly profit-oriented view of public services therefore falls short of what governments are supposed to do (which does not say there is probably lots scope for efficency-enhancing in most administrations). As a sidenote, running huge deficits is not uncommon to big companies, especially in digital services. As long as creditors are convinced these debts will be paid, companies can be run on losses for quite a while. 

Yes. It is a fair comparison. Human nature, market behavior and principles of finance and economics have not changed much in the recorded history of mankind. For example, the principles set forth by Adam Smith in his opus The Wealth of Nations are just as relevant today as they were in 1776 when the book was published. 

Let's define $P^*$ the price of market equilibrium, $Q_D$ as the quantity demanded and $E_D$ as price elasticity of demand. Then: $$ {slope} = \frac{rise}{run} = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q_D} $$ And in mathematical terms, the verbal description of the PED reduces to: $$ E_D = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q_D}{Q_D} \cdot 100}{\frac{\Delta P}{P^*} \cdot 100} $$ $$ E_D = \frac{P^*}{Q_D} \cdot \frac{\Delta Q_D} {\Delta P} $$ $$ E_D = \frac{P^*}{Q_D} \cdot \frac{1}{slope} $$ Edit Constructive comments have been incorporated into this answer. In particular, @Kontorus pointed out: 

Economists have been exploring control theory applications to macro economics for decades. For example, here is a 40 year-old research paper written in 1976 on the topic. 

Corporations are essential and they do provide benefits to the overall economy. Corporations are essential in the sense than individuals, when given the freedom to choose, do choose to invest their capital in corporations. And these corporations, in turn, use this capital to produce products and services which other people voluntarily purchase. Corporations are a net benefit to the economies in which they operate because they produce products which customers voluntarily purchase for prices which allow the corporations to return a profit to their shareholders. To the extent there are exceptions to this vis-a-vis crony corporations and government subsidies, the previous paragraph is notwithstanding.
