The sentence in the Wikipedia article prior to the one you cited gives a rough idea of how Foucault moves towards to structuralism. 

The difference is essentially the same as that which Gottlob Frege discusses in his seminal work On Sense and Reference. Putnam essentially uses the word meaning in place of Frege's sense, presumably because it seemed more intuitive for Putnam to splinter reference from meaning rather than make meaning a redundant term in our language. The distinction between meaning and reference is simple: meaning/sense is the intension or the word, name or symbolic representation of an object; the reference is the thing to which the intension corresponds in the world—the reference is the object to which you are referring, if you will. For instance, if you think of a battery, you have the word battery and you have symbols for batteries, such as: 

and yet you also have the battery as a physical object, as an actual battery in the world, an extension. You have that which you mean and your ways of meaning it. The referent and the symbol to refer to it. An interesting parallel between analytic and continental philosophy is Frege's distinction between sense and reference, which is also acknowledged in semiotics as the distinction between signifier and signified. Putnam differs from Frege in where meaning and reference sit. For Frege and others like him, meaning is a social, communicable sign/symbol and reference is in the world. For Putnam, both meaning and reference are in the world, because reference influences the formation of the symbols and names we use for meaning. Putnam sought to prove his argument with his famous Twin Earth thought experiment. 

I am very critical towards theories that try to describe (self-)conciousness as emerging property of systems only. Emergence is nothing more than an euphemism for surrender: It is the admission that the theory cannot explain this in any way and - more importantly - in some sense that the theory is lacking something. The evolutionary problem of the becoming of the conditions that make personal self possible is perhaps not explicable at all, at least I am not aware of any convincing explanation. But what already has been explained long before is the becoming of personal self in a being that already is capable of it because of the structure of its existance (a priori conditions in the best of its meanings). Self-conciousness or the knowledge of the self is traditionally defined by the possibility of reciprocal self-recognition by and in other selves. This reflects on the problem of Descartes: In order to realize cogito ergo sum you already have to have a self that is part of conciousness first and foremost. Most theories of the personal self I know that adress the becoming of it do at some point refer to what was first worked out by Fichte, who's concept of the absolute self is commonly rejected because of its idealistic implications, but nevertheless his dialectics of self and non-self for the becoming of self-conciousness is regarded as generally correct. This theory is elaborated in his Grundlagen der gesammten Wissenschaftslehre, reformulated in his Grundlagen des Naturrechts (opus postumum! from lectures and manuscripts), which (of course, like many other ingenius works of German Idealism -.-) is not yet to be found in English as far as I found out, only in German. In the most abstract (and methodologically elaborated) way of the conditions a priori for personal self that I am aware of is established, deducted and described by Plessner in his The Levels/Stages of (the) Organic and Man, Introduction to Philosophical Anthropology (translation at work, yet unpublished). But he also cannot say anything about the becoming of them. (Disclaimer for those professionals that dislike philosophical anthropology because of Gehlen and Heidegger: This is totally different and by far more philosophical). To summarize, the problem is far too complex to squeeze it in any format suitable for SE. And any answer given would hardly be accurate. What I can recommend for further reading is the only published book in English language that does introduce into this thinking: Plessner's Philosophical Anthropology 

The author is trying to argue that there is a fundamental division between act and rule utilitarians, and that these utilitarians are then further divided into flavours, such as preference and hedonistic: 

Derrida generally resisted labels, and in particular he resisted the label of post-structuralism because his ideas were derived from structuralism—différance arising from Ferdinand de Saussure's linguistics—and, in point of fact, deconstruction only makes sense as long as it forms an extension of the structuralist approach, i.e. is within the bounds of a structuralist conceptual framework. For Derrida, structuralism was not completely wrong, it just had limitations like every other school of thought. Without structuralism, Derrida's work does not make a great deal of sense. By saying that deconstruction is antistructuralist he is essentially creating a binary opposition between structuralism and deconstruction, and so it would never be post-structuralist, because it depends on its opponent; even if it does dismantle and criticise structuralism, without structuralism it is nothing. Appending would imply that structuralism was dead and buried, but this would be the last thing Derrida would say. Indeed, I imagine he would have rejected the use of for any school of thought in philosophy, because it would imply that what came before was irrelevant or inferior, which would stand in opposition to his idea that philosophy is essentially a genealogy, a taxonomy of ideas in which every idea or school of thought is significant and serves to define its precedents and antecedents. 

What I am looking for some secondary literature that would highlight and pick up this thought of the (specifying) measure being related to gauge choice. Is there any? 

Beware that the distinction you are assuming may not be there. Hegel writes in the Philosophy of Nature §202b that 

In the rest of the text, of course, whenever two opposites are identified as two moments, that unity of opposites gets a name. (As in the archetypical example of "becoming" being the name of the unity of the moments of "nothing" and "being", e.g §152.) Here I am wondering: what is the name (the term, if any) that Hegel assigns to the unity of the ideal and the real? The ideal and the real are two moments... of what? (Is it maybe "ideality"? I probably don't really understand yet the rest of §324.) 

One may formalize this is any formal system with a good concept of equality. One of these is homotopy type theory which knows the identity type (X = K). It is then a theorem that Sum_X (X = K) is a contractible type whose essentially unique inhabitant is K itself. David Corfield just the other day wrote a note on this for an audience of philosophers interested in structuralism. 

There is a good essay on this by Wilfried Sellars, Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind. He there argues from a similar perspective against the givenness and objectivity implicit in some views on that and for a certain form of realism that seems to be ok for him. As I understand it, his position is that if we do not stick to one form (but the correct, i.e. his) of realism (that means of some properties of perception, not necessarily objects), there would be no knowledge possible at all, we would have to fall into radical scepticism. His favorite example is "redness". 

From the perspective of one of the best founded theories applicable to this situation, Habermas' Theory of Communicative Acting: As long as you cannot agree about the truth-conditions and underlying normative judgements at all, there is no meaningful communication possible. And that is pretty much what we experience every day. 

TL;DR Meillassoux' Cogito shares the notion with the famous one from Descartes because it serves the same function in the sense that it is thought as providing a firm basis for all future philosophy/knowledge. As @MauroAllegranza pointed out in the comments, Meillassoux additionally claims to have a "homologous procedure" in "proving" his cogito, i.e. a sceptical search for necessary and universal truth. It is - according to Meillassoux himself - different in (at least) two ways: It is not representationalist (subject-object relation) and it is not solipsistic. Long version Although frowned upon, I think it is helpful here to blockquote the important part from After Finitude from the beginning of chapter three directly and comment it: 

Regarding specifically Russell's attitude towards Aristotle's logic, I have come to wonder if in the course of a justified complaint about an enormous time span of intellectual stagnation, Russell maybe missed an opportunity to recognize a few excellent aspects of Aristotle's logic, which, after dismissing them, took much effort to be rediscovered by Russell himself and then eventually by other people. Here I am thinking of the fact that Aristotle's logic, while certainly naive and inaccurate from a modern perspective, has the exceptional feature of being a primitive kind of type theory. Where Aristotle says "All A are B" we should recognize what in modern systems would be a function of types A -> B (maybe a monomorphism, if you insist, making A a subtype of B). Where Aristotle says "Some B1 are B2" this is clearly to be read as an intersection of types, what in modern categorical logic is called a fiber product. From this perspective, two complaints that are frequently raised against Aristotle's logic seem to be easily transmuted into virtues: Some of Aristotle's deductions really depend on some silently assumed context. While that means that these were inaccuracies back then, today we easily know how to fix this right away: all types should be regarded as dependent types that exist in some context, to be specified. Another common complaint is that as Aristotle's types move from the subject of a judgement to the predicate, they seem to turn from types to propositions. For instance on the one hand Aristotle speaks of the collection of all mortal beings, on the other hand he speaks of the proposition "X is mortal". But there is no need to complain about this, in fact this very conflation is a famous accomplishment of modern logic, famous as the Curry-Howard isomorphism or the propositions-as-types paradigm. Of course one has to be slightly benevolent to see all this in Aristotle, but it seems to me that the ratio of benevolence over advantage of hindsight that we have is not too large. This is a bit ironic, because it is Russell him very self who, right after rejecting Aristotle, runs into the paradoxes of the young modern logic and is then the one to introduce the modern fix to these: types. See the references here. I came to think of this when following Lawvere's suggestion to keep an eye open for hidden insights in Hegel that are invisible to first-order logic but that begin to make a great deal of sense in modern categorical logic and type theory. Since Hegel likes syllogisms, that made me wonder. I have collected a few further details on what I have in mind here. 

I want to offer reliable sources (as asked for) for both the equity as well as commonly understood differences between ethics and morals. Please keep in mind that some authors do define their usage completely different. Your first task in philosophy is always to understand the usage of the terminology in the particular text you read. Or, respectively, carefully making your own understandings explicit by delivering definitions. Ethics = morals First, the distinction between ethics and morals is to some extend artificial and did, to my knowledge, not occur before the Enlightenment. As Virmaior rightfully stated, they were in the beginning just two words with the very same meaning, where moral(s) has simply been the latin translation of greek ethics: 

Regarding the purpose So, why distinguishing at all? The shortest answer would be: Because phenomenologically, there is an important difference. Enrichment of culture is simply something that labour cannot provide. The mode of activity in fact is different exactly in the way described, the inherent intent and purpose (especially consumption vs. use) is. Another aspect is that in distinguishing the thing-character of labour and the world-character of work, we better understand how labour is linked to nature: 

In Book I, third section, first chapter of Science of Logic, Hegel makes it rather clear, I find, that the measure that he is talking about -- at least in its aspect as specifying measure -- is a choice of (physical) units, hence is a choice of gauge. See §714: 

Generally, Physics is a chapter of Nature (namely the second, while the first one is "Mechanics" about space, time and matter (and their unity...) which of course we would subsume with physics), and nature is the externalization of the Idea (here), and the Idea is that which is objective and true in the Notion (here) and the subjective part of the Notion is deductive logical thinking, where one would locate also the activity of mathematics. Translated suitably, this should resonate well with common modern undertanding: fundamental modern physics is itself a mathematical theory (for amplification see the first few slides here), hence physics is in a sense that which is "objective" in mathematics, in that it is the part of mathematics that connects to, let me say, the real world. So if we say that the concept of mathematics is magnitude, or measure, then there is an "objective" aspect of that, which is that which gives reality, that is nature, in particular physics. In case you care, I am preparing notes with more details here, for a workshop next week.
