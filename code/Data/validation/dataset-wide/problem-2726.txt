The only "power" in question is rationality (freedom from natural laws, both in perception and action). A nice summary of the distinction of faculty vs. mere receptivity can be found in the Anthropology, § 7. The categorical imperative and kantian morality in general does not take into account any factual (empirical) power or equality, but moreso faculties and intention. One of the best textbits to illustrate that: 

Older examples (not mentioned by @Drux) Friedrich Hölderlin in his short fragment Judgement and Being presents a view where there is original being that is separated by the original judgement that sperarates into object and subject (The German term for judgement - Urteil - may be interpreted as meaning 'the archetype of seperation' - Ur-Teilung, which is quite a nice word-play). That obviously relates to some Buddhist thoughts about the illusion of our privileging of the self. But, contrary to Buddhists, he rejects the possibility of accessing the original being (i.e. there is no Buddhist's Enlightenment possible in his view). There may be readings of Heraclitus (I try to defend that position in an assignment) that are near to Buddhist philosophy as they emphasise the deceptive aspects of judgements in perception, resulting in paradoxical views on change and persistence as well as contradictory points of view in perception as well as logic. Another example not mentioned by @Drux would clearly be the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, a German philosopher who learnt Sanscrit (autodidactically!) in order to read the Vedas in original. He developed a philosophy very similar to Buddhist thoughts in The World as Will and Representation (1819) 

Holes are a negative in the first place: A not being within a certain being. It is a notion of difference. Take a hole in the street, for example: Even if it is filled, it can be perceived as a hole in the street because the filling is not the same, no unity, with the street. But it does not have to be perceived as a hole anymore. It is a matter of conceptualization: If I perceive the street as a plain unity, despite of filled holes, it is a street without holes. If I perceive the difference of the filling to its environment, I perceive it as a hole in the street, although it remains the very same street. But it does not exclude each other, otherwise we could not perceive a "street with holes". But without perceiving the differences as difference, there will be no holes. And this is not the only problem within this: If my concept of a street is that of a flawless plain, because I never saw damaged streets, every difference will seem to be a "hole" for me (I take fractures out of consideration at this point). If I am used to see repaired streets all the time, only if it is not repaired (i.e. filled with proper stuff that a cars can roll over without a difference) it will be a hole for me. An asphalt street repaired with pebble and sand will be a street with a filled hole, whereas if it is repaired with bitumen it will be a repaired street without holes for me. TL;DR: The more difference (from my concept), the harder it becomes to perceive a unity without this difference, therefore it becomes "natural" to see holes rather than "flawless" unity. This, of course, pushes me away from any naturalistic epistomology or form of realism (Plato,Locke,Berkeley,Price, Russel, Searle). But that's okay for me, because I stick to transcendental idealism/constructivism (Kant, Sellars). 

If we take a concept of behaviour as a very broad concept like he did, this question includes perhaps even more than the kantian question, as it directly includes social aspects, culture and so on. You have to differentiate all layers of nature: dead objects, plants, animals and humans and their specifics. 

We are confronted with two possibilities here: Either free will, or God. But why? Well, let's see what omnipotence implies for free actions. If our will is free, it is free in every concious action of a rational being (I take rationality to be important from "scholastic subtleties"). Either God is omnipotent, then he is able to intervene in our actions, too. Or our actions are free (our own sphere of freedom), then God would not be able to intervene, as in any other case the freedom would be his freedom to let us do what we want, but not ours. That is why "Maybe God just doesn't wish to exercise his powers" will not be able to perserve our freedom. 

Logic like mathematics is based on an axiomatic system, it is a formal system. Therefore, it is producing immanently tautologous propositions out of itself by its axioms. I am not sure if there has been a Kolmogoroff of all systems of logic exemplifying the axioms, though. 

TL;DR Good and evil are in their very core moral concepts and dichotomous for Kant, although there are texts where there seem to be things that may be in some respects called good, but can become evil. Therefore, I do not think that he can be taken to fit the picture Levinas is thinking of. On moral good and evil While in the moral sphere there is good and evil, the good is absolute as well as the evil is radical, so that they are dichotomous and reason is forced into dialectics, because both (the moral law and the pursuit of eudaimonia/felicity) are part of the human nature. This idea of twofold human nature is fully developed in Religion Within the Bounds of Reason Alone. BUT the overall picture is pretty consistent over time, see e.g. 4:405 for the Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals (1785), 5:47 for the Critique of Practical Reason (1788) as well as explicitely 6:37 for the Religion Within the Bounds of Reason Alone (1793) (and in general: book 1, chapter 3). I will quote from the last text, because it is most explicit about it: 

You have to consider what Occam's Razor is about: Take two explanations of the same human behaviour, for example altruism. They both are "reasonable" explanations. But one explanation has to claim that there are hippie-forces making people happy if they are altruistic and the other explanation does the same task without having to claim that there are hippie-forces, but stays in the theoretical framework needed for the explanation of many, many other facts. Which one is better? Well, it is better to cut off what is not needed. That's what we do if we use the argument of Occam's Razor. As a less polemic example from philosophy: There are theorists that claim that there are "sense data" as instances in addition to world and mind. They use them to explain how knowledge about the world is possible. Other theorists do not need these instances to explain knowledge about the world, but do only have to claim that there are world and mind. Therefore sense data theories (in making these claims) are worse than others. It's not about the complexity of explanations in relation to facts. It is about the complexity of explanations in relation to explanations, given that all explanations are fully appropriate to the complexity of all facts considered. That is very important in natural sciences as in philosophy, because it means, methodologically, that we should only claim additional things/forces/faculties/spins/quarks/laws etc., if the existing ones cannot explain all facts in their complexity. 

Conclusion That means that 'respect' has some aspects of beauty (also see first point), but does not express the feeling of an accordance with our capacities, but a shortfalling (as finite beings), and is therefore some kind of the sublime. But the main difference to both of them is the objectiveness of the (grounds of the) judgement, as the object of beauty as well as the sublime is different (intuitions/representations vs. morality as a concept, see 1) in the remarks on the analogy). They are therefore destinct, but purposive, as they each acquaint with one of what is both part of the moral feeling, i.e. respect. 

First, you have to consider the background of Minima Moralia. It is a benumbed reaction to the Third Reich, especially the immoral acting of so many citizens in just tolerating and playing deference to (or even support) the crimes happening. The PhD I read this book with in a seminar had the thesis that this is in fact refers to the dulling that happened: If they would have used their intelligence and therefore ability to judge, noone would had been able to act in this immoral manner or even stand the things going on. Therefore, Intelligence is a moral category. You have to make use of your intelligence to act morally, it is reason and therefore judgement. So, the main statement is that for morality, you have to judge. And this implies the use of your intelligence. That makes it a moral category. As a sidenote, Adorno knew very well that it hasn't been that easy to publicly condemn what happened. Therefore, the Minima Moralia should be taken by its title as a description of a minimal account for morals. 

It has to be considered that there obviously are major glitches between the epistemological/ontological divide in idealism as defined and the respective divide in realism. The SEP article on realism states just before the definitions given: 

Keep in mind that he writes this before he even had the time for an in-depth analysis of the arguments! Together with Förster's reasoning, it makes Timmermann's remark that "Kant still had little reason to be impressed" by the full review (xxvii) rather improbable. As a counter-argument to that another letter from Hamann to Herder should be considered that deals with the Garve-review as well (from Dec 9th, 1783): 

The best answer I can think of for the overall question is: That's simply not how Kant works. Let me explain why. Implicitly, the answer is already given in Kant's universalization explained: How does one universalize a thing? Like in the answer, the first step will also be to identify the maxim. Why is that so? You referrred to the Formula of Natural Law in comments, which is: 

Taking the core of the question seriously Having several answers in place already, I will nevertheless answer myself, because I think most of them do emphasise the point of asking in terms of religious beliefs, but this context of the question may be seen as only an example here. The point is of course that it is quite questionable to question information a person gives about their mental state in the first place, no matter if it is about religios belief, pain, or the arkward feeling that something is wrong. If someone asks for a proof for a mental state you are reporting about, it puzzles. On a first look, there is no way for doing so, as mental states are not something 'in the world' we could 'objectively' argue about. As I understand it, there are therefore two different ways of taking the core of the question the moment I can free myself of the heavy burden of theological qestions by simply omitting any particular context: 

This could mean that the last of a species, as nothing could be placed as its equivalent, would have dignity, whereas one child under millions does not. But oh! on the contrary! 

The standard objection against positions like your suggested is that this is a "categorical fallacy": While you can easily describe human behaviour (like ethical judgments) as based on material, measurable events (i.e. is in some sense dependend), it is simply not valid to identify them. The hidden assumption is a scientific realism: Only what is scientifically measurable is real and vice versa. The problem with this position is the same as with idealism: It is reductionalistic. Natural sciences can only describe material events. They describe things insofar they are materia/energy, and in this, they are the best possible procedure. What neurologists often forget is that they are not simply describing the world as it is, but interpret it. And that is the core of the problem: The identification of occurences in the brain and human behaviour is itself interpretation, that is human behaviour, which can (by assumption, which is human behaviour) be identified with neural activity by interpretation and so on. Helmuth Plessner in his not yet translated work (according to Wiki) "Die Stufen des Organischen und der Mensch" therefore stated that the only epistomological position that is able to overcome the Mind - Nature dualism (and the implicit reductions of realism and idealism) is a phenomenological analysis of life, that is behaviour in the broadest sense, both of subject and object. A similar approach has been attempted by pragmatists like Dewey. 

The judgement of beauty therefore links a representation [Vorstellung] to the subjective feeling it evokes. He writes regarding interest: 

Regarding the German law First, there is academic freedom, yes. It's in the 5th article, number 3 (Art. 5, Abs. 3 GG) of the german constitution, the Grundgesetz: 

Problem Your two examples have different logical structures. So I will treat them separately. First example Negating Antecedent and Consequent (also known as improper transposition) The logical structure simply is: A → B, therefore ¬A → ¬B The fallacy lies in not switching antecedent and consequent. Therefore, it is the inverse rather than the contrapositive. It is only the contrapositive that is logically equivalent to the original proposition and therefore already implied in it. You can read more helpful links and thoughts explaining these terms and their differences in this related answer. Second example and header The header and the second example have another logical form. They correctly state the implication (NOT syllogism!) A → B, therefore ¬B → ¬A But the validity (or truth value) of this depends on the truth value of 'A → B'. Therefore, arguing along these lines without further support is begging the question or petitio principii, as another answer correctly stated. It is a type of circular reasoning. Explanation Your second example basically argues that by attracting money, you become rich, and as you are not rich, you did not attract money. Here, you presuppose that it is only by attracting money you become rich, and from that, you gather the implication, the contrapositive. As both sides (before and after "therefore") are logically equivalent, it can be transformed into A → B, therefore A → B Or, if you like: X → X It is like saying "There IS God, therefore there is God.", while thumping on the table. This is begging the question. 

Long story short: This has already been done by scholars, but... See e.g. (and for further reading and sources) Gosetti-Ferencei, Jennifer Anna. Heidegger, Hölderlin, and the subject of poetic language: Toward a new poetics of Dasein. Fordham Univ Press, 2004: 

Förster continues that the foundation of/reason for the relation for two situations seems to be unproblematic: Sensing means that the object invokes the perception, moral acting means invoking an object from a perception. But how can we possibly imagine a relation between a metaphysical object and a perception so that we can judge the truth-value (that is understanding the relation)? How is metaphysics possible? Another translation of Kant's own thoughts on that: 

I will try to make up an actual maxim corresponding to your example of leadership: If I want to envision/enact a political system [both situation and intent], there should be one person within the system who takes the lead role [means] in order to make it functional [intent]. This leaves open how the person for the lead role is found, WHO THIS PERSON IS, the legal and institutional framework that both defines the role and its limits, etc. But whatever, let us try to universalise. The principle says that every person in the same situation should be able to will this maxim as if it were a natural law, i.e. with absolute necessity and without exception. The universalisation will end up in stating: Whenever a person wants to envision/enact a functional political system, this person should always and necessarily do that in a way so that they want that one person within that system takes the lead role. This can be argued as false, especially for smaller communities. On the scale of society and institutionally constituted states, I think this actually holds true and is without contradiction. The error in your thinking probably is that there are actual persons that think differently and therefore it is wrong, as some really think they should be the leader. But this, again, is not how Kant works. The universalisation is appealing to the faculty of reason of every (finite) rational being, not the beliefs of a particular person. So in a way, it states "act so that the maxim of your action could be enacted by everyone every time they get into the situation without contradiction". To get to the outcome you mentioned in the OP through Kantian universalisation, the maxim would have to be "If I want to envision/enact a (functional) political system, I should be the leader in that system". The universalisation of this would indeed be "Whenever a person wants to envision/enact a political system, they should always and necessarily want to be the leader of that system." This would lead to many, many one-person-states if taken seriously, everyone would necessarily want to be the leader and nobody would support any leader but themselves. But one-person-states wouldn't be political systems in any legitimate sense and hence a contradiction in conception as it lies in the very concept of a political system that there has to be a political sphere of persons in mutual relations.
