I have managed to completely disassemble a pair of old pedal clips, looking vaguely similar to yours. If they are not handed, then you could simply reassemble them with the most worn clip on the other side. This may not be viable if the clip is worn to the point of not working any more. Essentially the same idea as rotating the tyres on a car, swapping front for back to even out the tread wear. 

Like you I have a folder, with 46 tooth single chainring and 14-28 6 speed. That's 60 to 30 gear inches. On that combination I can easily run out of gears at the top while riding on the flat. So a gear combination of 46/14 can't really pedal faster than 35-40 km/h because at that speed your cadence is 135 RPM. On the flat I start in 4th gear, cos if I start in lower gears the bike tends to rotate rather than roll forward. On the other end, riding a steep grade is hard work in 46/28, and anything above 10% grade is a challenge. Answer Depends on your environment. Given the same cadence, 52/14 will reach a higher top speed than 48/14. Suggestion take both bikes for a test ride up the steepest incline you're likely to ride. Compare their low gearing on the way up, and their high gearing on the way back down. 

If you want to see your phone while riding that gets messier. Personally I keep my phone in my pocket with the screen off. Otherwise you'll need a handlebar mount, or a top tube bag, or both. Its a good idea to bring a USB battery pack and cable for your phone, because a phone that runs for a day of normal use might only get 2-4 hours of riding time before its flat. Right-angle USB cables can help organise things too. 

I wanted to add some more info, as I am a downhiller and did a fair amount of street biking and park. The bike will probably handle the stairs, but some components will definitely suffer (headset, hubs, rims, spokes and fork). Depending on the frame quality and material, the frame could break. That said, having broken two cheap frames, it takes quite a lot of abuse before actually breaking. The wheels are a lot more likely to explode before that, which would result in a face plant, i.e a severe head first crash. As others mentioned, I advise you to get a suitable street/dirt mountain bike if you want to do this and further (Gaps, rails, 180s)... Also, consider wearing a helmet if you get into this seriously. 

Rode downtube friction shifters bikes for a while. I can see two possible causes : either the shifter was too lubricated, or the screw isn't tightened enough. Try to tighten it more, but pay attention not to tear the screw. Usually the lever is pretty rigid when moving. If it's easy to move it to the point it moves alone, it's probably because it wasn't tightened properly. If this does not work, you'll have to unmount it and delubricate the parts a bit. 

It's difficult to advise you on a specific bike, as everybody has it's own opinion. I've just bought a 2016 carbon ghost nivolet with discs and ultegra for 1400Â£, and here are a few things I considered prior to my purchase : Value of a bike decreases a lot when bought new, I'd say around 30%. For that reason, buy a 2016 bike rather than a 2017. Chain Reaction still had some really neat offers on 'new' 2016 bikes not so long ago. Some brands are a lot more value than others : Canyon, Rose, Ghost, Cube, BMC. Look into those 'bang for the buck brands'. I valued german built, because carbon has to be well built. Play with the exchange rate if you can. That said, here is some things I noticed riding my bike : 

Handcycle These are powered totally by the rider's arms, not by the feet (foot) This one is probably a tricycle, but the theory works the same for a 2 wheeled bike. 

The latex mix is pushed through a hole and as it passes to the lower atmospheric pressure, the liquid comes out and leaves the salt/latex material in a clump to seal the hole from the inside, which looks like this. 

I always wear a full-arm length high vis cycling top, with full gloves and full leg pants. The only parts of me that are exposed are face and neck. Sunblock just makes sense - there's no fun in a ride where you're getting damaged and have a week of bad sleep afterwards. If its expected to be hot, rub sunblock on the ears, neck (front and back), lower face, nose. If you're bald or have short hair, put sunblock on the scalp or fit a light cloth handkerchief to the inside of your helmet. Here's what happened after I had a #1 buzzcut, then took a ride down the beach. It feels worse than it looks. 

I think you're looking at the lists backward - they have lists of banned substances. Everything else is okay and permitted because its not banned. So if your medication contains anything on the banned list you're best finding an alternative or dropping that product completely. You're able to prove that you made inquiries, and that your supplements do not list anything on the banned lists. You've done all you can short of getting your supplements chemically analysed, which is a bit extreme and unreasonable. Imagine if you did get hauled up for having something in your test results - you have made more effort than most, and you have the paperwork/papertrail to prove it. Just focus on your pre-race training, pre-ride the routes if at all possible, and plan your diet for before and during the event. And plan on tapering nicely. 

I just built a trailer based on the Wike DIY kit. I decided to make it after seeing this great looking trailer. I don't have experience with single wheel trailers. I am happy so far, but my experience has been very limited. The intent was to use it for local cargo runs - not long-hauling/touring I'll report more here as the months go by Here is a shot of mine with its first load 

I initially looked for a reflective vest but then found very inexpensive LED lights. I got a red one that I put on the rear that I set to flashing mode, then another white one for a front "headlight" and another red one I clip on my backpack or other place near the rear of the bike. I also bought a few reflecting tape pieces and hang them around the rear of the bike. 

Have you considered a trailer? This also allows local unloaded trips from a base without all the gear loaded. Keeps weight down low too. 

I have done it and it worked fine. Another alternative is to drill the correct size hole in the opposite side of the wheel - thus you can run presta or schrader in the same rim. I inherited the wheels set up this way. The person explained his reasoning that he preferred to just pump up the tire after a flat rather than changing tubes or patching. My questions about puncturing the newly inflated tires immediately after got me a dim look since it sounded like he didn't bother to do any triage to remove the cause of the flats... 

I have a 1998 aluminium road bike, and it made creaking noises in the stem when pedaling hard. Could replicate this by siezing the bars while stopped and wiggling. So I tightened the quill stem and the noise went away. Its just a bit of play in the steerer tube/quill stem fixing. Since you're asking, a frame should outlive you, assuming no crash damage and its garaged/treated well. Give it a good wash and then look over the frame for any cracks... but try and see if they're paint cracks or frame cracks. Then run your bare fingers over the surfaces - you should feel only flatness, no ripples or bends. Your bike is probably welded, not lugged, so have a close look at the welds. Ideally they should be smooth and flat, but some bike welds look like beginners (cheaper MTBs are chronic for the industrial weld look) Forks can be measured to make sure they're not bent too, but this is fiddly and normally only done if the bike doesn't track right, or there was a frontal impact. 

An electric bike can let you get into more energetic collisions because of the velocity increase, and therefore the increased momentum. Related - other road users can fail to observe your real forward speed. I've had multiple times where a car would pull out in front of me because they thought they had time to get out of the driveway or round a corner. This can be termed "looking but not seeing" where they observe a bike 50 metres away, check the other way, go, and I've ridden that distance before the car has completed the manoever. 50 metres is only 4 seconds at 45 km/h. Some ebikes allow the rider to not pedal. This decreases the rider's overall visibility even more than just being on a bike - something about the vertical movement of the legs helps indicate to other road users that you're a bike. Sitting stationary can make an ebike look like a person standing still from some angles.
