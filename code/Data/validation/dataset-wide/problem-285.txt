Dump something thick and sticky (and probably hot) on their head. In large quantities. Bonus points if it sets up thickly after a bit, double bonus points if it sets up hard. Well, you mentioned that they can be pushed over. Gushing a large volume of thick, sticky liquid (I'm thinking heated resin, or tar, or something of the sort) straight down on their head is likely to a) push them straight downwards, and b) distract the hexandaquarter out of them. Flying will be somewhere between harder to outright impossible with that kind of weight and force shoving them downwards, and the distraction quality means they might not even try for a bit till they figure out what's going on. You didn't mention superstrength to move with it hindering them, or even to get it off them - but even if they have it, the basic idea should work if you scale up the stickiness/thickness to blind, distract, and hinder while you set up for the kind of imprisonment mentioned in other answers. Since the hard part will be catching them, I think. The bonus points, of stiffening or setting up when cooled (or dried, but drying takes longer) - means that their movement will be hindered, their limbs stiff and slow, they will have to carry extra weight when levitating, they will have a hard time seeing and possibly breathing (of course, they can wipe it off when still fairly liquid - but this adds to the distraction element and gives it more time to set up). Additionally, it is possible that this will hit a limit on their invulnerability. They may need to breathe - and thick sticky stuff setting on their face will endanger their airways. They may have resistance to hard blows, but maybeso not to higher temperatures - even if they escape actual burns because of invulnerable skin, what about heat stroke, or heat exhaustion? how high a temp can their brain take, or their blood, when there's enough volume and insulation to prevent them from cooling off? How to make it work - probably a pipe, and a building, and something to lure them to the spot where it's set up? The pipe would let not just a large quantity, but a continuing volume. Or if you've got really good aim, maybe something dropped from a helicopter or plane (though the volume would be less, maybe something even thicker to begin with to compensate?) If they can fly, then a situation where they're talking to someone on the ground might work, since they might stay in place because they would be "secure" in knowing that the only way to reach them is from above, and they're invulnerable anyway if something is dropped on them. Alternatively, you might be able to shove him into, or dunk him under, a pool of the stuff - but you would be relying on his overconfidence-because-invulnerability to let himself be trapped in that way. Will he stay still while a cement mixer tips its contents over him? only if he's really arrogant. But a pipe might not be noticed if it's cleverly set up and disguised. 

I'm pretty sure your society will not survive. You are asking about the impact of women-only generations, and the reintroduction of males to this society - the answer (if they survive that long) will be generations of gender discrimination and stereotyping, and the very real threat your society will simply fail to follow a plan, whose last adherents are decades gone - which will again lead to the loss of your society. I mean, there's a bit of a chance (and no guarantee) your planet will have human people living there, but your carefully-planned society... no. So, first. You have a single point of failure, or actually you have a chain of single points of potential failure, that can easily destroy your colony because there are no backups or alternates, the situation of which is planned to persist for 80-200 years. Your fecundation machine, is a problem. Given the plan that the colony is lower tech than the parent company, the odds of someone being able to diagnose or fix the machine if it breaks, or if something goes wrong, is pretty low. Or if not the machine, the sperm bank. Or any of the steps or processes along the way. Even if you ritualized it into religion, the chances of something going wrong they can't figure out how to fix, is pretty high - considering you're gambling with the only thing that will let the colony survive. Next, you have the problem of generational culture. I would honestly not expect any planned influence from earth to last beyond three generations - that is, the grand-kids of your colony ship - if it isn't day-to-day relevant to each generation. They can tell stories, and teach lessons, and plot and plan a great deal - but the kids are growing up in a different world, a world which needs their immediate attention, for survival. The kids will be creating their own culture and customs, and while their parents will have some influence, their grandparents will have much less (probably only limited to stories and advice). I'm drawing from ideas of how immigrant generations adapt, as a start - not a perfect analogy, but something. The point is, the 8th generation has no real reason to obey the words of the first-generation, not if it will destroy their culture, not if they can't see the need for it, not if they're afraid. So all your careful "cultural" planning will probably not work, at least not beyond a few generations. Next, the reason they might not "reintroduce" the males. In this scenario, you have 8+ generations of a female only society - with customs, and culture, and stories, and the whole of living memory reinforcing the way things are done - and you're asking them to uproot all of that, to reintroduce strange creatures that they have only vague stories about, to change fundamental parts of their society (including stories of very different families and lifestyles from the first colonists, I'm guessing). It's a sudden shock, an upheaval, that will destroy their society as they know it - and they will want to avoid it, especially since it is within their power. And when they do confront it, it will certainly be about them and their culture, not the bedtime-stories of those generations ago, that guide how they will react. Some will just not want to - after all, they have a method that works, why change it. Some of them will see men as only for breeding - after all, they haven't been needed until then, so probably not that useful. Some will be frightened of the concept of natural reproduction, and of the idea of men. Gender stereotyping and gender discrimination will be rampant, any physical difference (however slight) will be exaggerated and demonized, and the matriarchy will consolidate itself to keep power and keep these "men" in their proper place. All of these will occur anyway, given the size of the social change - but culture can play a big role, even if they can't eliminate any of these possibilities. So, the setup post-reintroduction of men, is going to be a bit like the patriarchy, and the gender discrimination that rose up (and that we've spent so much time trying to undo the harm from), on earth. I'm really kinda not sure why you want that to happen (though I guess lots of storytelling opportunities), so maybe why does your colonizing society want that to happen - because there's just no way it won't. There is a non-zero chance that your society simply won't reintroduce the men on schedule, and go with the fecundation machine until it breaks, in which case your society is doomed. Maybe they'll wait until "later", where later is a few generations before the machine stops working - except, oops, that kind of later is much easier at finding "too late" rather than "just before too late". Maybe they'll frantically try to figure out cloning or other alternatives to reproduction, and probably fail - or try to "fix" the machine, or recreate it, because by now they probably don't know enough about reproduction the natural way to know why it won't work. Maybe by the time they run out of group "A" and have to start on group "B", the society is large and strong enough (and set enough in its ways) that men are raised as slaves, and only used for reproduction. Maybe they'll move on to group "B" when they run out of "A" - but practice infanticide on the males, so they don't have to change their culture, until the machine runs out (either formally planned as a society, or individuals making the "safe" choice with unintended consequences). So, after all that, what can you do that will work? Start with a few (one or two) boys in the very first generation, and keep the tradition going. Given you're talking about dropping the reproduction rate from ~3 kids per woman, to maybe ~2, you can probably afford a few extra kids in each generation. Even if there's fewer of them, you have your generations of women growing up alongside men, you can teach lessons of how people (both male and female) should be treated and those lessons will be passed down, because they're relevant and being used by each generation. Even a few boys from the beginning means your colony isn't solely dependent on equipment and procedures they can't repair or perhaps even understand. You can still build up your population and diversity with generations of mostly women, but without the trauma that would come from 'reintroducing' men with no clue, no experience, and no way to tell what was true and what was just stories. Even a few boys each generation will mean your colonists grow up alongside them, and know that they are people, and are taught early enough (when the originals know what's at stake) to treat people right - and the lessons can get passed down because they're used and needed, so will probably last a lot longer than if they're imposed on people and never used otherwise. And even a few natural reproductions each generation means that people will know what is supposed to happen and how, fewer people will be afraid, and the transition from fecundation machine to natural reproduction will be much smoother. Teach them about inbreeding and why the gender balance was intentionally skewed, so that bringing the balance back up to equal won't be such a shock. There will be a few natural reproduction situations each generation, but between being taught about inbreeding, and birth control, and families being encouraged to also have kids by fecundation machine, it will probably be manageable - and, really, they will have learned and passed down the lessons about inbreeding while they still made sense, while your women-only generations probably would have forgotten or gotten the rules all mixed up because the situation didn't match the rules for so very long. 

Tropical island, right? They should have a concept of cold, already, that comes straight from the water. Water sucks the heat right out of us, and even shallow, sun-warmed waters will chill a person right down to dangerous levels if they're in it long enough. Water just doesn't get hot enough naturally, not in large bodies like oceans, to match our body temperature, and it conducts heat too well not to try to equalize the temperatures. Additionally, if they send any time in deeper water, maybe for swimming or fishing, they will have noticed the difference between the sun-warmed surface, and the deeper currents running cold. Very noticeable, and can be quite startling even if, or especially if, the day is hot and sunny. And as a bonus, when one's been in water long enough for it to feel warm(and the cold-shock of jumping in has faded), getting out of the water is terribly cold, as the body suddenly acknowledges all the heat it's lost in the water and one more chunk of warmth is lost to any breeze trying to evaporate water from the skin. Even rain would give them a basic sense of cold - maybe not so much on sunny warm days, but cool nights with a breeze? it feels cold even if the temperature isn't that low, especially since they would be comparing it to how it normally is for them, not what's cold for us. That said, I think the ocean-cold is a better metaphor to draw on - like I said, it can reach pretty dangerous levels, even hypothermia, if they have reasonably deep waters, or even just shadowed waters, they might come in contact with. So, the metaphor for this cold might be something about the air swept through like the dark, freezing undercurrents of the ocean and stole their courage like a riptide. Or maybe how, in a single heartbeat, they had become as chilled and clumsy as one pulled from the ocean after hours at sea. Or the mist that wafted through the air, leaving behind such a shock as if one had been dumped into cold water. Or how the air seemed as water, for, though they were dry, the air pulled warmth out of them with every steaming breath, and they shivered as if from a fever. Or, well, something like that. 

Probably the best way to do this is by making the merging more...symbolic. It can still be pretty nasty, with a correspondingly high chance of infection, death, chance to show off manly scars, but it might be somewhat survivable, whereas yours is...less so, and will quickly die out with any tribe that adopted it. So how it would work is, you would have each helmet crafted to the specifications of the person coming of age - possibly by them, or with their involvement, maybe with a ritual purification, a blessing, certain rituals, etc. This is going to be their helmet, forever - it should show status, it may have ways to add later acquired symbols of status (prowess in battle or the like), it may be heavily decorated, engraved, and symbolic. For the actual ritual, you may want your warriors to have their heads shaved, or maybe (increasing survivability again) have them shaved a set amount of time before the ritual, so there's an even stubble of hair at the time, since some heat would be spent burning the hair rather than flesh. There will likely be ritual cleansing, maybe fasting or in the other direction, feasting (with lots of alcohol), or other religious/social rituals surrounding the day. As their initiation, each warrior will be branded on their heads by a red-hot helmet (possibly in privacy). They may or may not have rough medical treatment before putting on their helmet, and going out to display their new status symbol. Practically, it would make sense to have a specific helmet just for branding, it would be easier to make to spec, to replace when damaged, and less problematic if the branding helmet cracked under thermal stress (likely, over time, to happen to someone). Symbolically, this would be about marking them as equals, branding them as warriors of the tribe first and foremost, and only later given their individual status as the helmets they display. On the other hand, you might want to play up the "merging" of warrior and helmet, if so then it would be their own helmet they were branded with, to closely link themselves, flesh and bone, to the metal of the helmet and symbolically "imprint" them to their warrior (though in this case the helmet must be cooled before being worn for display). Anyway, they would display themselves wearing their new helmets, and some time afterwards (how long depends on all sorts of things) they would go home and be given proper medical treatment, including bandages. Their scalps would be given a chance to heal before they must wear the helmets into battle - though perhaps they may be required to wear them in public for a time/forever to further the symbolic merging - and the time to heal and access for treatment would reduce the likelihood of infections and other nasty consequences. As far as pre-initiates or outsiders are concerned, the helmets were (permanently) attached to the scalp via burning. If the helmets must be worn in public for some time, or ever, this would only reinforce the notion. And there are genuine burns under their helmets, which would only reinforce the idea if someone were to see a person without their helmet for whatever reason in private. These symbolic helmets may or may not be the same as the helmets they wear into battle. Status symbols are usually for show rather than use (since breaking them is bad), and you would need some ritual way of re-attuning a new helmet each time the old one is damaged or breaks past usefulness in battle. If the helmets are different, the status symbol can be kept, likely for life, and it can also be a great deal more ornate and symbolic - this would be the case if important thing was wearing a helmet, rather than the specific one. On the other hand, if you're playing up the symbolic merging, it could be that no other helmet will do because it is "mystically bonded" to its warrior, depends on how religious vs social the ritual is. In any case, what the ritual would actually be doing is just branding the person - which will show off stoicism, strength and resistance to pain - which is a fine and survivable manhood ritual. Either they will be branded as warriors of the tribe, and later take up their individual status, or else they will mystically bond to their helmets through this ritual. It will also probably reduce or eliminate head hair (which may be desirable, as it "shows" that the warrior is always ready to wear their helmet and do battle, or else emphasizes that the head is not "complete" without its helmet). The conception that this merges the helmet to the head can be accomplished by having the new status symbol be mandatorily worn in public for some time, coupled with the scars if or when someone sees a person without their helmet. There would still be some losses to infection or other complications of the procedure, which would play into the seriousness of such a ritual and also the myth (since merging the helmet to one's head would also be expected to produce fatalities).
