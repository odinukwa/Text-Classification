It is well-known that Shimura varieties can be defined over number fields and that moreover they possess canonical model over number fields. On the other hand, Teichmüller curves can also be defined over number fields. Do Teichmüller curves have canonical models? what are effective or helpful results in this direction? 

Let $Sh_{K}(G,X)$ be a Shimura variety and $Z\subset Sh_{K}(G,X)$ be a special subvariety. $Z$ is given by a Shimura sub-datum $(H,Y)$ with $H\subset G$ an algebraic subgroup which I call the $Mumford-Tate$ $group$ of the special subvariety $Z$. For $\gamma \in G(\mathbb{A}_{f})$ we have a Hecke transform $T_{\gamma}:Sh_{K}(G,X)\to Sh_{K}(G,X)$. It is well-known that $T_{\gamma}(Z)$ is again a special subvariety of $Sh_{K}(G,X)$ and hence is given by a Shimura sub-datum $(H^{\prime},Y^{\prime})$. Now my question is that can one explicitely describe the Mumford-Tate group of $T_{\gamma}(Z)$ i.e. $H^{\prime}$ in terms of the Mumford-Tate group of $Z$ i.e. $H$? For simplicity you can assume that $Sh_{K}(G,X)=A_{g}$ (moduli of principally polarized abelian varieties). 

Considering $A_{g}$ the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties, there is a variation of Hodge structures $\mathbb{V}=E^{1,0}\oplus E^{0,1}$ of weight $1$ on $A_{g}$. It is well-known that the tangent bundle $T_{A_{g}}$ satisfies the equality: $T_{A_{g}}=S^{2}E^{0,1}$. Now my question is that what is the analogue of this equality for period domains of higher weight Hodge structures? More precisely, let $D=G/K$ be a period domain for Hodge structures of weight $k\geq 2$ which is a locally symmetric variety. Then can the tangent bundle $T_{D}$ be described in terms of symmetric powers of pieces of Hodge structures? How realizes one the analogue of the above equality in this case? I'll appreciate any useful reference. 

Consider a Kodaira fibration. i.e. a smooth non-isotrivial fibration $X\rightarrow C$ with $X$ a smooth complex surface and $C$ a smooth complex curve, such that both the genus of $C$ and genus of the fibers (which are complex curves) are at least $2$. By abuse of notation I call $X$ a Kodaira fibered surface. What is known about the structure of the universal cover of $X$? In particular, when is it a bounded symmetric domain? I know that $X$ is a minimal algebraic surface of general type and that the universal cover of $X$ can never be a ball in $\mathbb{C}^{2}$. 

I think at least historically the Jacobian is related to the function theory over a curve which was one the main areas of research back in the 19th century. In that time given a compact Riemann surface $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$, the question was to understand the behavior of holomorphis and mermorphic functions on this curve. If we have two effective divisors $D$ and $E$ on $X$, when is $D-E$ the divisors of zeros and poles of a meromorphic function $f$ on $X$? Let the genus of $X$ be $g$. Then there are $g$ basis elements of the vector space of differential forms on $X$. The clever solution that Abel proposed for this question was this: let $\omega_{1}$,...,$\omega_{g}$ be the generators of $\Omega(X)$, the space of holomorphic differentials of $X$. Given a path $\gamma$ in $X$, the set $L=\{(\int_{\gamma}\omega_{1},...,\int_{\gamma}\omega_{g})\}$ is additive in $\mathbb{C}^{g}\cong\Omega(X)$ because of additivity property of integrals and in fact is a lattice. Therefore we can quotient out and get a group $\mathbb{C}^{g}/L$. We also get a map $ A:X\rightarrow J(X)$ by choosing a base point and $p_{0}$ and sending each point $p\in X$ to $(\int_{p_{0}}^{p}\omega_{1},...,\int_{p_{0}}^{p}\omega_{g})$ mod $L$. Abel realized that two divisors $D$ and $E$ (viewed as a collection of points on $X$) are linearly equivalent if and only if they have the same image under the map $A$. Note that the map $A:X\rightarrow J(X)$ in itself is a very interesting map: we have constructed an almost natural holomorphic map form $X$ to a variety that has a structure of a group. In the first glance it is not at all clear that we can have such a map. The second funny property is that this map is not injective if and only if $X\cong \mathbb{P}^{1}$. 

Assume a fintie set of monomials is given. Is there a way to find the family of ideals whose initial ideal (say w.r.t revlex order) is generated by that finite set? I'll appreciate any partial answer, reference or suggestions. 

Projectivity (over complex numbers) implies completeness of course, but $X\subseteq\mathbb{P}^{N}$ does not imply that $X$ is projective. For we have $\mathbb{A}^{1} \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{1}$. But $\mathbb{A}^{1}$ is neither projective nor complete. So his meaning is that $X$ is closed and hence projective and complete. 

I know that abelian varieties of CM type have central importance in algebraic geomtry and number theory. There are many conjectures and concepts related to them like Andre-Oort, Coleman conjecture, Shimura varieties, etc... . But why CM abelian varieties came into consideration in first place? Why did mathematicians begin to study CM abelian varieties? I am in particular intereseted to know the relation to "special functions". 

Let $C=\mathbb{H}/\Gamma$ be a hyperbolic surface and $c$ a cusp of this sruface. In the paper "Billiards and Teichmüller curves on Hilbert modular surfaces" by C. McMullen, it is claimed that near this cusp the surface decomposes into horizontal annuli. My question is how one explicitely finds these annuli near a given cusp to compute their modulus. You can assume as in the mentioned paper that the cuvr has genus $0$. 

By a group of Hermitian type I mean a real group $H$ with a maximal compact subgroup $K$ such that $H/K$ is Hermitan Symmetric domain. A real group $W$ is called of Hodge type if the associatd complex group $G$ admits an action of $\mathbb{C}^{*}$ such that $W$ is preserved by $U(1)$ and the action of $-1$ on $G$ is a Cartan involution. These definitions can be found in Simpson's article "Higgs bundles and local sytems". Now let $h:H\to G$ be a homomorphism of real algebraic groups where $H$ is a group of Hermitian type and $G$ is a group of Hodge type. Let $K$ be the maximal compact subgroup. Is it true that the tangent bundle of $H/K$ lies necessarily in the horizontal subbundle of the tangent bundle of $G/K$ and that it decomposes to an orthogonal direct sum? I will appreciste any Useful references on this problem. 

Is there a classification that determines all isomorphism classes of compact Shimura curves at least Shimura curves in $A_g$? I did not find this in the literature and appreciate any helpful information. By compact Shimura curve I mean Shimura curves associated to quaternion algebras over $\mathbb{Q}$ 

One of the best books on this subject is the book of Voisin "Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry". But it maynot sometimes be as self contained as you need. You may find the book by Carlson, Müller-Stach, Peters, "Period mappings and Period domains" more readable. A less famous resource is the book by Bertin, Demailley, Illusie and Peters, "Introduction to Hodge theory". It is a good reference and contains many informations from basic to higher levels and from complex and $L^{2}$-methods to characteristic $p$ ones. By the way, now there are many online courses and lecture notes about Hodge theory which you can easily find by googling. For example this one, which is short and elementary or this . The first chapters of Griffthis-Harris book "principles of algebraic geometry" are a good introduction to the complex bases of Hodge theory. 

Is there always a finite family of Shimura curves $(C_{i})$ in $A_{g}$ the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $g(\geq 2)$, such that the union $\cup C_{i}$ is connected and such that $\cup C_{i}$ is not strictly contained in larger Shimura subvarieties (special subvarieties) except $A_{g}$ itself? i.e. there does not exist Shimura subvarieties $Z$ in $A_{g}$ with $\cup C_{i}\subsetneq Z$ and $Z\neq A_{g}$? I will appreciate any suggestion of results related to this problem and/or suggestions how one can possibly construct such families. 

Let $f:X\to Y$ be a holomorphic map of holomorphic manifolds. You can assume that $dimY=1$. Let $\tilde X$ and $\tilde Y$ be universal covers of $X$ and $Y$ with group of holomorphic automorphisms $Aut(\tilde X)$ and $Aut(\tilde Y)$. Do we get a homomorphism $Aut(\tilde X)\to Aut(\tilde Y)$ in general? 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be smooth algebraic varieties over a field $k$ of characteristic $0$. For varieties we know that $X/k$ is rigid if and only if $H^{1}(X,T_{X})=0$. But $H^{1}(X,T_{X})$ also parametrizes the first order deformations. So in fact we have that there is no infinitesimal deformations if there is no first order infinitesimal deformation. My question is that does the same hold true for deformations of morphisms? Namely, let $f_{0}:X\to Y$ be a morphism. Then we know that first order deformations are parametrized by the space $H^{0}(X,f_{0}^{*}T_{Y})$ ($T_{Y}$, tangent bundle of $Y$). Is it true that $f_{0}$ is rigid if $H^{0}(X,f_{0}^{*}T_{Y})=0$? i.e. if there is no non-trivial first order deformation? If there is a reference for this in the literature, I'd be grateful to know. 

I would like to know the classification of representations of the form $\rho:B^{\times}\to Sp(V,F)$ or ($Gsp(V)$), where $B$ is a quaternion division algebra over a number field $F$ (or $F=\mathbb{Q}$) ($B^{\times}$ is the multiplicative group). In other words all of isomorphism classes of such irreducible representations. I would appreciate any reference to this. 

I don't know it is exactly what you want or not. But a reference not in the context of complex manifolds but smooth schemes is for example "Neron models" by Bosch-Lütkebomert, setion 2.2: If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a morphism of smooth schemes, then $f$ is etale at $x\in X$ if and only if the canonical homomorphism $(f^{*}\Omega_{Y}^{1})_{x}\rightarrow (\Omega_{X}^{1})_{x}$ is isomorphism. Now this last condition is equivalent to smoothness of $f$ at $x$ (proposition 8) or the fact that $Jac(f)\neq0$ at $x$. This shows that in fact $J_{f}$ and $R_{f}$ are the same at least as sets. But it is also proved there that the map $(f^{*}\Omega_{Y}^{1})_{x}\rightarrow (\Omega_{X}^{1})_{x}$ is isomorphism if and only if the canonical homomorphism $(f^{*}\Omega_{Y}^{1})\otimes k(x)\rightarrow (\Omega_{X}^{1})\otimes k(x)$ is injective. This in turn shows that $R_{f}$ and $J_{f}$ can both be thought of as the kernel of this restricted homomorphism at each point. So $R_{f}$ and $J_{f}$ are the same as schemes. In that book, they also mention (p.40) that this is the counterpart of Jacobi criterion in differential geometry. 

Voisin's book is quite (but not always) self-contained and well-written. For the supplementary references, you may use the first chapters of Griffiths-Harris "principles of algebraic geometry" which can help you to understand and motivate the complex backgrounds of complex Hodge theory. The book by Carlson, Müller-Stach, Peters, "Period mappings and Period domains" is more readable and self-contained than Voisin's book. The book by Bertin, Demailley, Illusie and Peters, "Introduction to Hodge theory" is less famous but a very good reference specially if you are interested in interactions between complex Hodge theory and Hodge theory in characterstic $p$. Note that nowadays, there are a lot of online lecture notes that are simplified and can help you to understand the content of Voisin's book much more easily. For example this or this which is more detailed. By googling you can find even more references. Also, your background of representation theory can help you a lot in Hodge theory, as it constantly appears in studying Hodge theory and in Voisin's book (for example the very important notion of local systems is nothing but studying representations of the fundamental group).
