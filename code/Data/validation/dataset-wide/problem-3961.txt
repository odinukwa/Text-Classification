Wikipedia says that it is a theorem of Hilbert that any projective plane that satisfies Desargues' theorem is the projective plane which is the set of lines thruogh the origin in $D^3$, where $D$ is a division ring. As Wikipedia also explains, you also need Pappus' theorem to know that $D$ is commutative. Then you are more or less done. 

I found an example in the mathematical literature where the same ordering on words, and more specifically continued fractions, is called "alternating lexicographic" order. I guess that there are other examples too, and that this is name can be considered standard. The term "boustrophedonic order" also appears in the mathematical literature, but it seems to mean something different. The boustrophedonic order on the English alphabet is AZBYCXDW... . In my opinion, calling your ordering boustrophedonic is clever, but I think that "alternating lexicographic" is more consistent as well as more standard, since it is an alternating combination of the lexicographic and colexicographic (or lex and colex) orderings. 

Concerning your first question: For many questions, the easiest way to see the nuts and bolts of a projective variety $V \subseteq P^n$ is to look at its cone $CV \subseteq A^{n+1}$. After all, the graded ring whose Proj is $V$ is the same as the ungraded ring whose Spec is $CV$. Obviously, there is almost always a singularity at the origin; but if you ignore that point, the other singular points all correspond between $V$ and $CV$. You can also think of the grading as geometrically represented by multiplication by $k^*$, if you are working over an algebraically closed field $k$. (Because the homogeneous polynomials are then eigenvectors of that group action.) You can think of $V$ as obtained from $CV$ by and then dividing by scalar multiplication. The atlas-of-charts analysis of a projective variety is certainly important, but to some extent it is meant as an introduction to intrinsic algebraic geometry rather than as the best computational tool. 

This is an interesting question, but the motivation is a bit misaligned. $C^*$ algebras are a non-commutative or quantum generalization of compact Hausdorff spaces and von Neumann algebras are a non-commutative or quantum generalization of (not too unreasonable) measurable spaces. However, both of these generalizations are contravariant. Your motivation is a covariant comparison between von Neumann algebras and topological spaces, which is problematic. The von Neumann algebra or $C^*$-algebra $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ is now famously known as a "qubit"; it is a great non-commutative analogue of $\mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}$, which is of course the complex functional algebra of a classical bit. The endofunctor that you ask about is a geometric product of $X$ and a qubit, and the morphism in your question is a geometric projection back to $X$ with a qubit fiber. So the completion that you ask about is thus a geometric product with a quantum Cantor set. I forget what the fiber is called in the $C^*$-algebra setting, but I remember that, unlike a classical Cantor set, its isomorphism type depends on the sizes of the matrices. In the von Neumann case, this quantum Cantor set is interpreted as a measurable space, and then it is always the hyperfinite $II_1$ factor and does not depend on the matrix sizes. I think that the hyperfinite factor is not the only fixed point of tensoring with a qubit. Let $S$ be any set, let $F$ be the set of functions from $S$ to a bit (or any finite set), and then let $M$ be the von Neumann closure of the local operators on $\ell^2(F)$. Here a local operator is one that affects only finitely many values of $f \in F$. If $S$ is an infinite set of any cardinality, then $M$ goes to itself when you tensor it with a qubit. 

The Hahn-Banach theorem is really the Hahn-Banach axiom. Like the axiom of choice, Hahn-Banach cannot be proved from ZF. What Hahn and Banach proved is that AC implies HB. The converse is not true: Logicians have constructed axiom sets that contradict HB, and they have constructed reasonable axioms strictly between AC and HB. So a version of Andrew's question is, is there a natural Banach space that requires the HB axiom? For the question, let's take HB to say that every Banach space $X$ embeds in its second dual $X^{**}$. As Shechter explains, Shelah showed the relative consistency of ZF + DC + BP (dependent choice plus Baire property). As he also explains, these axioms imply that $(\ell^\infty)^* = \ell^1$. This is contrary to the Hahn-Banach theorem as explained in the next point. A striking way to phrase the conclusion is that $\ell^1$ and its dual $\ell^\infty$ become reflexive Banach spaces. $c_0$ is the closed subspace of $\ell^\infty$ consisting of sequences that converge to 0. The quotient $\ell^\infty/c_0$ is an eminently natural Banach space in which the norm of a sequence is $\max(\lim \sup,-\lim \inf)$. (Another example is $c$, the subspace of convergent sequences. In $\ell^\infty/c$, the norm is half of $\lim \sup - \lim \inf$.) The inner product between $\ell^1$ and $c_0$ is non-degenerate, so in Shelah's axiom system, $(\ell^\infty/c_0)^* = 0$. Without the Hahn-Banach axiom, the Banach space $\ell^\infty/c_0$ need not have any non-zero bounded functionals at all. 

If $X$ and $Y$ are two reasonable spaces with universal covers $\tilde{X}$ and $\tilde{Y}$, there is a nice picture of the universal cover $\widetilde{X \vee Y}$ which has the combinatorial pattern of an infinite tree. The tree is bipartite with vertices labeled by the symbols $X$ and $Y$. The edges from an $X$ vertex are bijective with the fundamental group $\pi_1(X)$, and likewise for $Y$ vertices and $\pi_1(Y)$. To make $\widetilde{X \vee Y}$, replace each $X$ vertex by $\tilde{X}$ and each $Y$ vertex by $\tilde{Y}$. The base point of $X$ lifts to $|\pi_1(X)|$ points in $\tilde{X}$, and likewise for $Y$. In $\widetilde{X \vee Y}$, copies of $\tilde{X}$ are attached to copies of $\tilde{Y}$ at lifts of base points. For example, if $X = Y = \mathbb{R}P^2$, then the tree is an infinite chain and $\widetilde{X \vee Y}$ is an infinite chain of 2-spheres. This tree picture nicely and dramatically generalizes to Bass-Serre theory. 

Hi Terry. Here is a sketch of an argument that should yield the estimate $1/\varepsilon_d = O(d^{3/2})$. That is not your full conjecture, but it is getting there. I haven't checked every detail of the more delicate second half of the argument, but it should work. First, let me rephrase the question with only polynomial overhead. The contrapositive of your statement is that if the integer lattice is a lattice packing of $K^*$, then it is a lattice covering of $\varepsilon_d K$ (up to a factor of 2). You can replace $K^*$ by the largest inscribed ellipsoid $E$, and then John's theorem says that $\sqrt{d} \cdot K \supseteq E^*$. Then, after a linear transformation, we can say that $E = E^*$ is the round unit ball $B = B_1(0)$, i.e., the $\ell^2$ unit ball. The contrapositive hypothesis is that lattice $\Lambda$ is a lattice packing of $B$, i.e., a unit sphere packing. You want to bound the sphere covering radius of $\Lambda^*$. By taking a Fourier transform on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, what you know is that $\Lambda^*$ is a "1-design" in the sense of Delsarte. (This is with a scaled Fourier transform so that none of the geometric lengths have factors of $\pi$.) If $f$ is a sufficiently regular function whose Fourier transform is supported on the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^d$, then the integral of $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ equals its sum on $\Lambda^*$. I have a paper on $t$-designs [arXiv:math/0405366] which suggests a method that could give you a covering radius, although in my paper it was the analytically easier case of a compact domain. The idea is to find an $f(x) = f(||x||_2)$ whose integral is positive, yet which is non-positive for $||x||_2 > c$, and whose Fourier transform satisfies the support condition. Then $\Lambda^*$ must have a lattice point in the ball $B_c(0)$, and indeed in $B_c(p)$ for any $p$. I call this the "positive island" method. In one stage of the argument in my paper, I made a positive island function on the manifold $\mathbb{C}P^d$ of the form $P(z)/(a-z)$, where $P$ is a Jacobi polynomial (with indices suppressed) and $a$ is its last zero. This was for $t$-designs on $\mathbb{C}P^n$ (and later the simplex, using the moment map). There is a similar formula for ordinary spherical $t$-designs on $S^d$. To make this expression relevant to your question, you can take the limit as the degree $t \to \infty$ and the positive island shrinks to a point. In this limit, the geometry of the manifold becomes approximately Euclidean and so approximates your question. The island function $P(z)/(a-z)$ limits to the function $$f(x) = \frac{J(||x||_2)^2}{c^2-||x||^2_2}$$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $J(r)$ is a hyperspherical Bessel function and $c$ is its first zero. So, for roundabout reasons, what should happen is that the integral of this $f(x)$ vanishes and its Fourier transform has the right support property. If you perturb $f$ slightly, you can make its integral positive. I imagine that there is a direct argument for the properties of this $f$, but I did not work at it. However, I did check a few cases numerically with Maple and it seems to work. For instance, the integral on $\mathbb{R}^3$ of $$f(x) = \frac{(\sin x)^2}{x^2(\pi^2-x^2)}$$ vanishes. Now, the first zero of the first hyperspherical Bessel function in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is the same as the first zero $j_{(d-2)/2,1}$ of an ordinary Bessel function. I believe that this number is $O(d)$. This would yield the estimate $1/\varepsilon_d = O(d^{3/2})$, since you also get a factor of $O(d^{1/2})$ from John's theorem. 

One viewpoint, which is a bit gauche for your construction but valid, is that the general result is a corollary of Archimedes' theorem, that the projection from a 2-sphere $S^2$ to an interval $I$ is measure-preserving. Whether or not you view it as a coincidence, Archimedes' theorem has an important generalization. Namely, $S^2$ is the simplest example of a projective toric variety, and the coordinate projection is its toric moment map. The moment map of any projective toric variety is measure preserving. For instance, the moment map from $\mathbb{C}P^n$ to the $n$-simplex shows you that the Fubini-Study volume of the former is $\pi^n/n!$. You might also recognize this as the volume of the unit ball $B_{2n}$. There is a simple symplectic map from $B_{2n}$ to $\mathbb{C}P^n$ which is 1-to-1 in the interior and quotients the boundary to $\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}$. (I learned/realized these facts in an old discussion with Doug Ravenel and Yael Karshon.) So you could say that the original relation has a good explanation in complex and symplectic geometry, and that the explanation has been disguised a bit in real geometry. Moreover, that 2 arises because $\dim_\mathbb{R} \mathbb{C} = 2$.
