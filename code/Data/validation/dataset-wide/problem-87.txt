As has been pointed out already, 32,000 years is an inconceivably long time to lack progress. Positing harsh conditions (war, famine, plague, etc.) is not enough; necessity is the mother of invention, and war in particular has historically been one of the great drivers of innovation throughout human history. WWII alone gave us great advances in aviation, automobiles, medicine, cryptography, plastics, and nutrition, not to mention the invention of radar, the computer, and nuclear power. No, to be stuck for that long, someone has to be actively working to suppress progress, such as an all-powerful wizard king who fears the rise of new technologies that could challenge his dominance, particularly weapons, or powerful dragons who fear the rise of technological weapons that would give common people a much easier way to slay them, or psychically gifted "gods" keeping technology in stasis so that the common people cannot develop ways to rise up and challenge them, or... well, you get the point. 

There's a potentially very scary downside to all this: "computer virus" is suddenly not just a figure of speech anymore. If you do this, you've lowered the barrier to entry to creating biological weapons far enough that it's essentially guaranteed at least one person somewhere in the world is going to create and release one. 

If you want magic that can't be properly studied and analyzed like science, but also can't be so completely chaotic that it's not able to produce reproducible results (wizardry, etc,) then have you considered an invisible Flying Spaghetti Monster? Magic is real, and is reasonably consistent, because that's the way that The Being That Takes Care Of Magic (TBTTCOM for brevity) wants it to be. But every once in a while, some scholar gets a little too big for his britches, trying to not only probe into what magic does, but why. And TBTTCOM doesn't like that, so TBTTCOM subtly shifts and twists things around until they either just sorta fail, or blow up in the scholar's face. Sometimes literally. Or sometimes even worse than that; did you ever wonder where some of the creepier mythical curses come from? It's happened enough times throughout the ages that scientific experimentation into the fundamental principles of magic has become the stuff of cautionary tales. Which, of course, doesn't stop people from occasionally trying. Generally they come in two varieties: naive, idealistic and inexperienced young wizards who don't know any better, or great and powerful archmages who think they do know better, who have studied the mistakes of the past and know how to avoid making them... not that that matters to TBTTCOM; they'll just make some new mistake this time instead! 

Something has gone horribly wrong in Mundus, a fairly standard medieval fantasy world. A rather eccentric wizard was carrying out some research and one of his spells blew up in his face, causing a catastrophic event: throughout the world, every sentient being--humans, elves, dwarves, dragons, even the Gods--suddenly vanishes all at once, caught up in the wild magic and instantaneously carried forward in time by approximately 300 years. When they emerge, after a brief but intense period of vertigo, they find they're in the same place as they had been, their clothing and anything they had on their person is still intact, but the rest of the world has lived through those 3 centuries the normal way! Non-sentient life (plants, animals, microbes, etc) was not affected (directly) by the spell. What kind of challenges do they face, trying to re-establish society? They would not have as difficult a time as we would today, as there was less advanced technology to be dependent on, but all of their cities and dwellings would be in ruins to one degree or another by this point. Note: Just to keep things simple, at the time of the Catastrophe, no one in the world possessed any industrialization or large-scale magic capable of causing significant changes to long-term climate patterns. 

This is rather unlikely, from an engineering perspective. A marching band can pull off a trick like that because they're moving relatively slowly, and because a person is generally about as wide (distance from right to left) as they are long (distance from front to back). Cars, on the other hand, are considerably longer than they are wide. This means, as Samuel pointed out in his answer, that you need very wide buffers between cars in order to make it work. But there are problems with that. First, the system might work well, if timed perfectly, for intersecting flows of cars, but as soon as the first emergency vehicle, bus, or semi truck shows up at an intersection, the entire scheme blows up. (Hopefully not literally!) Second, the required spacing makes for very low vehicle density, when one of the main selling points for the idea of ubiquitous automated vehicles is that such a system could safely handle high vehicle density at high speeds, while human drivers can't. To make this work, then, you'd have to either stay at low density the whole time, or be constantly speeding up and slowing down, with the line of cars expanding and contracting like an accordion, as you move through the city. Acceleration and deceleration waste energy; the most efficient way to drive is to get up to a stable speed and stay there. A more likely scenario would be to have your AI actively control the traffic lights to improve efficiency. Have you ever been stuck for what feels like five minutes at a red light, with long lines of cars stacked up in both directions, while maybe one car every ten seconds goes by in the cross street? Or had to wait through multiple red lights to make a left turn because the green left arrow only lets two or three cars through at a time for whatever insane reason? (Why yes, I have lived in LA. Why do you ask?) Fix problems like these and you'll do a lot more good than you would by eliminating stoplights entirely. (Not to mention it works a lot better during the long transitional phase when most cars are still driven by a human being.) 

Has intelligent life evolved in a Game Of Life simulation? No. It's really that simple. Among other things, intelligence necessarily requires the ability to analyze information and make meaningful choices about it. This can't happen in a purely deterministic system such as Conway's Game of Life. Whether our world truly is nondeterministic, or is simply deterministic at fundamental levels so small that we don't have good models for them yet is a question for philosophers, but intelligent life must be capable of taking actions that appear to an outside observer to be nondeterministic, unpredictable choices. The Game of Life is perfectly deterministic; the entirety of the state of each round after the first is 100% predictable from the state of the previous round. Therefore, it is anathema to the evolution of intelligent life, no matter how large of a simulation is being run. 

Probably the simplest "problem" is literally sitting right in front of you: writing. The screen you're looking at right now makes perfect sense to you because of familiarity, but to someone who has never been exposed to the English language, or even the Roman alphabet for that matter, in their entire life, figuring out even basic functionality would be a daunting task in the absence of an interpreter, even on something easily identifiable as a computer. If I were an explorer, I would treat an unfamiliar computer with a great deal of respect/fear, on a similar level to an unexploded bomb. It could be a control system for something, and with wireless technology, it doesn't even have to be visibly connected to anything in order to cause unknown (and potentially dangerous) effects in the physical world. And if the aliens' society is even vaguely similar to our own, but more advanced, everything is going to be run by computers. If you don't know how to interact with it, you're not going to get very far! 

Yes, you can treat magic as a scientific discipline, but you have to do it well or it makes your writing look bad. Perhaps the best discussion of the topic I've seen comes from Brandon Sanderson, who is famous for creating stories with strongly rule-based magic systems and then analyzing what can be done with them. His thesis is stated as Sanderson's First Law of Magics: 

So, a king has a magical sword that makes him exceptionally powerful in combat. It's seen as a sign of his divine right to rule. Supporting him is a wise man who understands, to a certain degree at least, how the magic works. Congratulations, you've just re-invented the Arthur mythos! What would be the implications? Well, how did things turn out for King Arthur? He built up a great and powerful empire, but he spent so much time establishing and administering it that he neglected his wife, who ended up getting seduced by one of Arthur's strongest supporters, an act which, when it was discovered, ended up tearing the kingdom apart. He lived by the sword, and in the end died by the sword, or may as well have since he's not still around after that point. For all his prowess at being a warrior and a king, his much more basic failings as a man brought him down, and today, centuries later, most people consider his story a myth and openly doubt whether he and his marvelous sword ever actually existed in the first place. In the end, he and his sword accomplished nothing of lasting value except inspiring some really cool stories. As much of a downer as it is, without the technology in place to reverse-engineer the lightsaber, some variation on the Arthur story is realistically the best that's likely to happen. Even if he lives a full and fulfilling life and dies of old age, still in possession of the sword, what happens to it then? To own this weapon is to own a kingdom, either by virtue of the legend that goes with it making you be seen as the rightful ruler or, failing that, because having it makes you capable of conquering your way onto the throne. That makes it worth plotting, scheming, and killing for to a great many people, particularly if the king does not have a single clearly-defined heir who is ready and capable of stepping in at the time of the king's death. Can we say "succession wars"? (And even if that doesn't happen the first time, it will eventually, probably within a very few generations. If historical averages hold, that's a virtual certainty.) 

Having freely-available antigravity would turn the concept of security on its ear. Fences, walls, gates, moats or trenches, and any and all access control devices that restrict movement in two dimensions instantly become obsolete when the average intruder is able to simply fly over them. There are two ways to deal with this, as an author. Develop an entirely new physical access control paradigm, or have someone come up with an anti-antigravity technology that they install on security walls, fences, etc, that projects a field upwards that disrupts antigravity. This, of course, would lead to an arms race between intruders and security people. Maybe parasails or hang gliders become standard equipment for the determined thief, to allow them to glide safely over an anti-antigrav zone, for example... 

Power does make a king, but not the power of arms. That can be helpful to keep him a king afterwards, but what the Declaration of Independence says about governments "deriving their power from the consent of the governed" is more than just political rhetoric. A ruler's power, even his military might, ultimately derives from the resources produced by his nation, which we can simplify, for the purposes of this discussion, down to the single word "taxes". At the very simplest level, a king can't maintain administrative control over a non-trivial amount of land without administrators, nor tyrannical control without an army, and if he can't pay his administrators/troops, they're not going to keep working for him for long. And if a large enough percentage of the people decide to stop contributing their taxes--and especially if they can convince the king's administrators and/or troops to side with them--he's going to lose the control he had in short order. Even our hypothetical time-traveling soldier, whose power very literally "flows from the barrel of a gun," is dependent on scarce resources. As others have pointed out, once he runs out of bullets, there goes the source of his power. If he wanted any chance at all to prolong that power, he would need loyal followers; at the very least, a master smith and a master alchemist to produce new bullets and powder, and even that is pretty dubious when you start looking into the details of the technology involved! Without gaining the consent of a significant fraction of the people he wanted to rule over, our would-be "king" would never become much more than a common warlord, a thug who lives by the (metaphorical) sword, and eventually dies by the (quite possibly literal) sword. 

The question could be rephrased as, "what kind of historic event would eliminate the difference between corporations and government?" There are several significant differences. For example, a government can issue money and levy taxes; a corporation can't. A government can pass laws and enforce them; a corporation can make rules that apply to its employees, but its ability to make rules and enforce them is limited by the laws of the place(s) in which it does business. If a corporation tried to do things that are generally considered the exclusive province of governments, it would incur the wrath of the government, which would bring down problems upon their head in the form of financial penalties, law enforcement, or possibly military action, depending on the severity of their transgressions. To be able to get away with this, they would need to be able to withstand such wrath and come out on top. Therefore, what would be the tipping point? Corporations beginning to successfully field their own law enforcement and military forces. One scenario I've seen in which this occurred in fiction is in the Shadowrun backstory. Essentially, during a time of serious unrest due to food shortages, there was a train traveling through a major American city, filled with toxic waste. Rumor got around that it was actually filled with food, being shipped off to rich people while the common man starved, and a riot ensued, with people trying to storm the train. (It's heavily implied that the rumor was seeded deliberately by corporate interests to precipitate this exact chain of events.) Heavily armed private security on the train fought to defend it, killing many rioters. The company that owned the train ended up in court, for unlawful military action. They presented the defense that if the rioters had successfully stormed the train, they would almost certainly have contaminated a large part of the city and caused millions of deaths and severe injuries, and that the guards' work in protecting it was a massive public service. The courts ruled in their favor, and this set a precedent: corporations can have their own armed forces to protect their interests. And it was all downhill from there. There are other ways it could play out, of course, but finding some way of legitimizing corporate military is the most likely single tipping point. 

I'm reminded of the Paul Twister stories, in which the protagonist is immune to magical attack because he twists and nullifies whatever magic he touches. In those stories, Paul's ability is unique, but in yours, maybe it's not? If being a magic-drainer is something that occurs in a certain small percentage of the population, it likely wouldn't be uncommon for such people to be be hired as bodyguards (or, depending on the morality of your world, pressed into service through other means) by powerful interests such as kings and nobles, military commanders, and wealthy merchants. 

You won't be able to convince readers who have studied history and human psychology, because it simply can't happen. This isn't to say that a free-market-anarchist system couldn't be created, but it would never be stable for long enough to become a coherent civilization. If you look back through history, up and down and across the world, everywhere and everywhen you look, you always see social organizations shaped like pyramids. From a family tree, to a business, to a club, to a church, to a nation, there are always a few people at the top with decision-making authority, and a greater number under their authority, and as the total number of people grows, extra layers of hierarchy are added. It would not be an exaggeration to call this The Great Pattern Of Human Nature. The only stable social structures we see where the Great Pattern does not hold are very small ones, such as a circle of friends. (And when the group of friends grows large enough, one or a very few from among them will emerge as their leader.) There have been attempts to consciously reject this system from time to time, which, if they become notable at all, tend to be notable for their failure. Perhaps the most prominent in recent memory is the Occupy Wall Street movement, which rather notoriously gathered significant amounts of manpower and resources and accomplished next to nothing with it because they consciously refused to organize and have leadership. It would seem that, just as nature abhors a vacuum, human nature abhors a power vacuum, and where one exists, it will be filled, generally by someone with the will and means to seize it. And the problem with such people is that they aren't content with building a stable civilization; a conqueror's kingdom must always be expanding through further conquest. (This has been true throughout history; it's said that Alexander the Great wept when he realized how much of the world would forever remain outside his authority, no matter how many victories he won!) The idea that "a world without government would simply be a dystopian hell-on-earth" isn't just an idea that we've been taught; it's experience. Heck, it's not even history; it's current events. Just look at Somalia! (And look at how much less misery there would be in Somalia if the various petty warlords could simply be satisfied with ruling what they've siezed, instead of always trying to take over the rest of it as well. But they don't.) Or if you prefer history, just look at any number of brutal succession wars in any number of ancient kingdoms, especially following the death of a great conqueror. Power exists, fundamentally, as something objective, completely independent of the holder of that power. When the holder of power is removed from the equation, the power he held does not magically evaporate into happy sparkles and more liberty for everyone, and it never has. Instead, it creates a power vacuum, which creates a dystopian hell-on-earth until the dust settles, and generally for a while after that. The greatest achievement of the Founding Fathers of the USA was without a doubt the creation of a system in which power transfer, even between rivals, could be accomplished in a stable, predictable, peaceful way. This all derives from fundamentals of human nature, so it would seem that the only way to have a believable, stable anarchist society would be to have them not be human. I've seen this done well a grand total of once, in the Trilisk series by Michael McCloskey. The Vovokans were an alien race whose nature was such that a set of principles that were essentially anarcho-capitalist produced a stable society. They thrived right up until they met other spacefaring races and had some dealings with them that included reversals of position that the Vovokans considered natural, rational self-interest and their former partners considered cold-blooded betrayal. This led to a war that wiped out the Vovokan species almost entirely.
