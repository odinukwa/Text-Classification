The way you created it should not be problematic. However, especially if you make it possible for users to chose the unit, the unit should always be displayed. Here, the standard way in meteorology is to use meters per second [m/s], which is also complying to the SI units (more info here). The wind direction is often divided into two directional vectors, $u$ and $v$. However this is more science standard than industry standard as the ouput in degrees is more intuitive to interprete. In meteorology and climatology, the direction is only expressed in direction charcters (N, NE, E, ...) if the measurement or model output is not accurate enough to express it in directional degrees or if very exact values are not required, as for example in popular weather forecasts. (Notice that you can make it more exact by dividing the scale into smaller steps: Between N and NE, there is NNE, NEE, and so on). 

Additional information: The Amos study says that California lost 160 KM^3 of groundwater in the past 150 years. Now, add the amount of oil extracted. Then, add the amount of oil, water, minerals that are extracted along the West Coast of North and South America, Australia, Japan, South East Asian Islands. This should give some idea of how big are the holes human dug underground. 

The crust is not rooted in the mantle, and is cut in numerous crustal plates. Tectonic plates are held in place like an arch, so the gravity and lateral stress and friction are the main forces holding them up. Mantle flow provides uneven support to continental plates and is actually the main destabilizing force according to current theories. Based on the idea above, if humans dig up too much underground materials around the fault lines, the edges of the fault lines are weakened: there is less material to keep up adequate lateral stress. Then, the soil around the softer/weaker side of the fault will deform and be compacted, or fail and result in earthquake. Deformation/compaction and fault failure do happen naturally too, but humans may have extracted too much underground resources for the natural healing process to catch up with the rate of weakening at the edges. It is known that the fault of the West Coast is lacking stress and the soil is deformed in the Amos et al. (2014) study. If this keeps up, the arch structure of the crust will crumble down catastrophically, and in chain reaction too. And it doesn't take "much" edge weakening to fail an arch. 

To answer the second part of the question: as the indices show, the latitude needs to be considered. Currently I do not have the original publication by Gorczynski or Iwanow here, however there are some papers comparing different indices (there are several more), for example this one. Furthermore, the indices can be looked up in the most climatology basic literature and encyclopedia. At least, it is needed to mention that Gordon Stanger hits the point in his answer in the last sentence: The continentality is just one variable - there are several more. Look for climate classifications, like those from Köppen & Geiger or Schultz. Edit: Original reference Gorczynski, L. (1920): Sur le calcul du degre de continentalisme et son application dans la climatologie. Geografiska Annaler 2, 324-331. 

A seismic measurement, listens really close to the reflection from the subsurface. However, it's a little noisy. "Stacking" is recording the same place over and over, then adding it up to cancel out random noise and enhance coherent signal. However, just doing it in the same area would be very inefficient, therefore we change the acquisition over the point we illuminate, in the picture you see that we have a nice fan of ray geometries going to the same point in the middle, the Common MidPoint CMP. This leads some interesting behaviour. Normal Moveout this is the formulation to calculate how a record from a different angle can be shifted to be in line with another record for the aforementioned stacking. As you can imagine the records that have longer ray paths take longer, depending on the velocity of the rock they travel through. This shift down-ward is namen Normal MoveOut (NMO). The equation above is an approximation, but it's good enough for this explanation, check out the book for more info on this. Post-Stack vs. Pre-Stack A seismic acquisition over a 2D area is named 3D seismic, because X-Y-T (recording time). The data, repeated over the same point in X-Y as mentioned above will have several record with the same T and a different "offset" between the source and the receiver. That means, 3D seismic data coming fresh out of the field will be four-dimensional. This is called pre-stack. Once we do a lot of data preconditioning and filtering and a smarter version of the CMP stacking above, we get 3D seismic that is actually three-dimensional. Stacking versus Migration Stacked data will have all kinds of weird wave effects in it. Usually geologists will work on "migrated" data. A migration aims to find the "true" location of a reflector, reversing wave effects. I suspect you might get this one. Time versus Dpeth You may have wondered from before about X-Y-T. T stands for time not depth, that is because our data is measured in recording time and most geophysicists will work in time. Most likely the migration even is done in time and you get a X-Y-T cube. However, depth-conversion does happen, but it depends on a accurate time-depth relationship. People tend not to trust these too much. Caveat: A depth migration does not have to result in a X-Y-Z cube that you get. Practical Advice As a practical guide, you may want to start at the EBCDIC header. Was your data processed? Stacked? Migrated? Do you have a T-cube or Z-cube? Familiarize yourself with the binary header and a couple trace headers. What are the extents of your data? Etc. Machine Learning Most machine learning is done in proprietary code. The only open source code I know of in seismic deep learning is MalenoV. However, loading a full 3D seismic into RAM will not always be possible. Loading it into the GPU RAM will seldomly be possible. This is the first place, where you are free to come up with a smart solution. Bonus Here is a list of Free Geophysics Software and an awesome list of open geoscience. These aren't exhaustive, but a good start. 

As mentioned in the comments, the air temperature is the deciding factor. In the Troposphere, until ca. 15 km, the temperature decreases by about 6 °C per km altitude (more info on the lapse rate here). As an additional factor, the air temperature on ground levels is generally higher in urban environments, like Paris. Therefore, the natural outer conurbation area could provide lower temperatures, while it is warmer in the city due to the anthopogenic heating (cars/engines, house heating, ...). 

The borders are fluent between continentality and maritimity. However, there are several indices, aiming to clarify this question. For instance, the probably earliest one is from Gorczynski (1920): $$K_{Gorczynski} = 1.6 \cdot \frac{A}{\sin \varphi} - 14$$ where $A$ is the annual temperature amplitude of the location and $\varphi$ the latitude of the location. Another one, which is more often used, is from Iwanow (1956): $$K_{Iwanow} = 260 \cdot \frac{\Delta T}{\varphi}$$ where $\varphi$ is the latitude again and $$\Delta T=T_\mathrm{max} - T_\mathrm{min}$$ where $T_\mathrm{max}$ is the temperature maximum and $T_\mathrm{min}$ the temperature minimum. The results are characterized as following: 

The EBCDIC header is a 40 by 80 character sheet that is a remnant from the times of punchhole cards (I'm not joking). Usually it contains info about the state of the seismic. Processing workflow, acquisition geometries etc. The binary header has some more fixed data about the data set. The trace headers contrain every separate data set from the acquisition. Nice blog by Agile Scientific here. You can read about the details of seismic processing and conventions in the open access book "Seismic Data Analysis". It used to be several hundred dollars and has been cited in every seismic lecture I have ever attended. However, I'll give you some answers now. Common Midpoints CMP stacking, weighted CMP and NMO are highly entangled. 

Why exactly does water cool down by evaporation? What happens in this process? How much does it cool down? What's the formula to describe this process? 

The colon could be problematic as its function is not directly clear in this context. Maybe you could try: 

I can not really find a definition, not even in a geologic dictionnary: What are articulate (resp. inarticulate) shells? To be more specific, the term is related to tsunami deposits (tsunamite). 

Does your question go into the direction how the water gets 'onto the mountains'? Here is a meteorological-hydrological answer on this: Of course water, in its liquid form,is strongly determined by the gravitation. However when dissolved as water vapour, it is transported in the atmosphere (atmospheric water transport). Mountains do have an 'orographic effect' on the precipitation distribution in a landscape. This could, very very simplified, be described as follows: When air masses are horizontally moved, mountains represent barriers. The air has to rise onto along the mountains surface. In this upwards movement, the air expands. It gets thinner and can therefore contain less water vapour. In one point, it is oversaturated and begins to rain. In the Encyclopaedia Britannica, there is a brief explanation with a good explaining figure: $URL$ 

The scenario may correspond with the Pacific plates. There are numerous oil, and water extracting operations all around the Pacific. After decades of intensive and continuous resource extractions, it may be showing terminal signs of the natural healing process failing to catch up with the rate of weakening at the edges. First, there are quite a few very strong earthquakes concentrated in the last ten years ($URL$ This alone may be trivial since the Pacific Ring of Fire is well known to churn out earthquakes. However, combined with the recent persistent droughts of Australia, Chile, US (especially California), and this year, Canada, the situation may be really concerning. Droughts alone can be caused by weather patterns. Climate change can cause it too, but it is a global factor, as opposed to more localized factor such as weather patterns. However, I think that underground processes can also cause drought. Aquifers can store a lot of heat, so the lack of underground water means that the geothermal energy will dissipate into the surrounding soil, basically slowly baking it. Less water also means that the soil is more prone to compression. Compression, especially continuous, even if it's slow, also generates heat. Oil reservoirs are also similar, but since oil is more reactive to heat by transforming into gas, and continuously extracted by humans, their pore pressure varies more. The presence of oil reservoirs around the fault lines may serve as springs. By extracting oil/gas, humans lessen the expansion force of those liquid and gas and reduce the pore pressure, which stabilizes the fault line. But in the long term, as is the case now, the reality is that there will be not enough oil to provide adequate pore pressure/lateral stress/counter-compression force. This may be the cause of the recent frequent strong earthquakes; the plates are loosening. Eventually, all the edges of the Pacific ring will all fail in an epic catastrophe, as the arch structure of the crust crumbles. Also, by removing oil, it liberates more space for gas to form. Gas is more compressible and heated by compression; it is another source geothermal heat. It is like a bike air pump/air suspension system. The idea is that the excess of geothermal energy causes surface water to dry out faster. Another possibility is that the fault line of the West American continent is already caving in and is dipping deeper/entering into more contact with the mantle. The mantle is a way stronger source of heat, and without adequate of underground heat absorbers, the surface soil becomes baked. I think that it's also the cause of the Blob ($URL$ The heat of the soil is escaping into the ocean, forming the Blob. Combined with El Nino, it worsens the drought. 

Hyperbola Figure 14 will again take us a step closer to migration. Before, you looked at One source off-center and one receiver off-center. Now we switch gears again. Let's look at the easiest case here, $x=0$. Here the source and the receiver are at the same location, so the travel time $T_0$ to the imaging point I is equal in length before and after reflection from the subsurface point. But from before we know that this place I could be anywhere on a semi-circle in the subsurface (which would be an ellipse, if it wasn't for the fact the $S=R$, as we saw before). So we need something to convince our math, that instead of placing our image point I "anywhere on a semi-circle", we want the exact location. Here, we have several ways to look at it. If the image point $I$ in the subsurface is actually a point, we call it diffractions. The special property of diffractions is, that they will always reflect your wave right back at you (they diffract the wave, so they scatter the wave in all directions, hence, also back at you). So if you place your source and your receiver at location x=1 in this image, we can construct a triangle between the points $I$, $x=0$ and $x=1$. That means our traveltime T_1 can be calculated with good ol' Pythagoras ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$): $$1^2 + (T_0/2)^2 = (T_1/2)^2,$$ and we can do this for every point so that: $$T_N = 2 * \sqrt(N^2 + T_0^2/4)$$ and then: $$T_N = T_0 * \sqrt((2N/T_0)^2 + 1)$$ This coincidentally describes the eccentricity of a hyperbola. This is one way to go about finding diffraction hyperbolae, there are several others, but I tried to stick with the provided figures.
