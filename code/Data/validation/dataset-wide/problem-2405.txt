Here is a quote on the transfer of merit. Its discussed what the benefits are and how the transfer is done. The quote is from the book "What Buddhists Believe" by Ven. K. Sri Dhammananda, p. 409-410: 

Mindfulness will increase with correct, consistent practice. At some point, if continued practice occurs, the sleep cycle will be affected too, in the form of a lighter sleep with less dreaming and more awareness. When balancing the Five Spiritual Faculties, Mindfulness is the only factor that is not balanced meaning one can cultivate as much mindfulness as possible without creating any imbalances in the mind. I would recommend watching the video "How Mindfulness Creates Understanding (The Buddhist TV)" by Ven. Yuttadhammo. 

I recently bought this Ayya Khema Ebook Bundle. I bought the bundle for my own interest in the first place but after reading in them I would now like to share them with my friend, who is just starting out on the Buddhist Path. Can I share the books I bought with my friend or should I buy the Ebook bundle again in order to share it? Thank you for your time. 

Insight meditation cannot occur as a stand alone practice, it needs Morality and Wisdom too, the entire Noble Eightfold Path must be practiced together. All Path factors strengthen and support each other. There are a different reasons as to why insight might not arise. Some of them are: 

I tried to search a bit for some books by ven. Nanavira. I could only find this one Clearing The Path. Maybe you can use it. 

It means that ones five spiritual faculties are balanced. In meditation practice, e.g. Samatha meditation it means that if the mind strays from the primary meditation object, i.e. the breath, then one does not force attention back onto the breath. Instead it comes naturally and without striving. Joy related to practice, arises when ones practice gains momentum meaning that one spends little but right effort into cultivating wholesome habits and purifying the mind. Joy arises easily in beings that are non-attached. There is a lightness of mind because they do not carry any bagage from one moment to the next. Ease and joy arises when one interacts with reality instead of reacting. One is seeing reality for what it is, thereby gaining freedom from mental proliferation. 

According to the short description of this book calligraphy predated the development of Buddhism in China and Japan. It also says the following about calligraphy: 

Ultimately, Time exists only conceptually, i.e. as a mental formation. Thinking about past, present and future are mental events, happening in the present moment. We live only for one thought-moment at a time (momentary death). The mind might be chasing after some object or running away from another object but that also takes place in the present moment, thus we are always in the present moment. Conventionally, we can speak of Time as existing and exercising some kind of control over beings in conditioned existence. That can be seen in the workings of Kamma. Kamma is fourfold and one of its classifications are called "Time of Ripening"1, i.e. when the kamma is coming into fruition. There are actions that might produce their effects in this very life, they are called Immediately-Effective-Kamma. There are actions that might produce their effect in a subsequent life, they are called Subsequently-Effective-Kamma. Then there are actions that might produce their effects in any life as long as one is in the conditioned realm, they are called Indefinitely-Effective-Kamma. As seen here Time exists conventionally, as do beings and rebirth, since they are merely concepts, conventions and designations. Ultimately though, these concepts are not findable or inherently existing. In other words they fall under the doctrine of Emptiness (Śūnyatā). To further illustrate the difference between Conventional and Ultimate reality let's take a look at a quote from the Milindapañhā2 where King Melinda discuss Time with Ven. Nāgasena: 

These imponderables the Buddha advices not to contemplate since they will only serve to agitate and destabilize the mind making it less suitable for meditation practice. 

The answer is pretty simple; be mindful and guard the sense-doors. If one is not mindful of an object impinging on the sense-doors, craving will arise, i.e. liking or disliking. If one is not mindful, insight into the Three Marks of Existence, cannot occur. Here is a quote by Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw on exactly this topic; 

I once saw a television program about Buddhist shaolin monks. They were extremely skilled in martial arts and begin their training as young as 3-4 years old. Their day consists of martial arts training and Buddhist practice. I was wondering about two things: 

Yes there can be one Dhamma for all. The Dhamma taught by the Buddhas is timeless and does not change. These rare beings discover the path for themselves, they discover an ancient path, after which they teach it to other beings. The Dhamma is always the same. The Four Noble Truths do not change whether one is 5, 30 or 90 years old. There is though, different approaches to the Dhamma, depending on what age a human being has. If one is 5 years old, then a more simple and fantastic approach might be used. For example one uses in greater deal the stories from the Jatakas, to illustrate the different path factors such as ethical conduct. One might also approach it from a school teachers angle as Crab Bucket has done. He used clay to form dhamma wheels and drawings of the Buddha surrounded by animals. Ven. Yuttadhammo has made a video-series on how to do Metta meditation for kids. In the videos he speak very slowly, calmly and simply. It works really well for kids. So in other words. If one is pretty young in age then the complexity of the Dhamma, such as the technicalities of the Abhidhamma might not be the best approach:) If one is 30 or 90 years old, there are many different approaches. The best way to explain this, is to look at the different affiliations of Buddhism and then find an affiliation or several affiliations, that fits ones own understanding of the Dhamma. In the end, they all lead to the same goal, Liberation. Ultimately, to understand the Dhamma, one has to practice meditation. In the meditation one will truly understand that the Dhamma is timeless and always the same for all ages and stages.

Prevent the unwholesome that has not yet arisen in oneself. Let go of the unwholesome that has arisen in oneself. Bring up the wholesome that has not yet arisen in oneself. Maintain the wholesome that has arisen in oneself. 

Panatipata veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami; I undertake the precept to refrain from destroying living creatures. 

In AN 8.36: Ways of Meritorious Action, the Buddha speaks about different ways of making merit. He teaches that one can make merit by Giving, by practicing Virtue (Morality) and by developing Meditation. He also mentions in what sphere of existence a being will be reborn according to which meritorious deeds are practiced and to what degree (small, high, very high). In the sutta the Buddha only mentions Giving in combination with Virtue. Making merit by practicing Meditation is not mentioned. 

Edit: When reading your question again i see i misunderstood it a bit when reading first. Now i see that you are asking about the internally generated pride, e.g. because of ones own achievements and the like. I think that too can fall under "praising", here praising oneself. Pride can be refered to the so called asmi-māna meaning the "I-am-conceit". Here the Buddha teaches that one can create a self on 3 levels: I am inferior, I am superior or I am equal. They are all wrong view since they refer to a self of some kind which is not to be found anywhere. Also pride is one of the 10 fetters that are to be destroyed in order to reach Nibbana. According the palicanon.com pride vanishes completely only at the entrance to arahantship. 

You will know when to begin adding more time to your sitting practice. In the beginning quality is much more important than quantity when it comes to meditation. What does quality mean when it comes to meditation? Quality means to make an effort to keep the mind in the present moment, so that one can observe the arising and ceasing of phenomena without the mind following after them or running away from them and getting lost. By keeping the mind in the present moment one ties the monkey down. The mind is like a monkey jumping from branch to branch. By keeping the mind in the present moment is like taking the monkey in the hand and walking him to another area, an area that has only one tree. Now the monkey cannot jump anywhere. In samsara, conditioned reality, the mind can never be satisfied with anything because all objects are impermanent meaning they cannot bring any lasting and permanent happiness to the mind. So the mind jumps from object to object but everytime it's left with suffering. The hardest thing in the world is actually to do nothing. So don't be too hard on yourself. It's the nature of mind to wander. The tibetan buddhists have a saying that goes like this: "If the Mind wanders a Thousand times, bring it back a Thousand times". Step by step we train the mind so that it will not stray from the present moment. It's usually a long process so don't get stressed about it. You might also not see any apparent changes at first but everytime you meditate you are changing something. You are untying the knots, slowly. Don't be fooled by not seeing any changes from day to day or even from week to week. There are changes happening but in the beginning they are subtle. Results come not from how long one sits but from consistency, diligency and the ability to keep the mind in the present moment. It's like learning to play football. If one only plays once a week one will not improve that fast. If one practices let's say 1 hour every day then the benefits will be more solid and apparent. So to become good at any skill in life, one has to practice consistently. Don't worry if you sit 30 minutes or 10 minutes everyday, just try to make an effort to do a little bit of meditation every day. Then naturally you will increase your physical and mental stamina and then you can begin to increase your sitting time. 

When that is said, there is always something one can do in this very life. Practicing even 5 minutes of meditation with correct technique is extremely valuable. When sharing the merits one just gained with all beings one is also practicing the 1st parami of generosity (dana). Having these intentions of good-will also conforms with the Right Intention (Samma Sankappa) from the wisdom group of the Noble Eightfold Path. Do you have a pet? Did you feed it today? Did you lend an ear to a family member, sibling or friend? Giving your time and attention to somebody else, while having the right intention(s), is also to practice the Dhamma. Following the 5 precepts, working on balancing the 5 spiritual faculties, studying the Dhamma or explaining the Dhamma to other people are also great ways to get closer and more familiar with the Buddhas teaching, eventually culminating in one reaching the other shore. In Buddhism intention is important. The Buddha said that intention is what he calls Kamma. The first verse in the Dhammapada states mind comes first, intention comes first. If one has wholesome intentions, i.e. intentions of good-will, harmless and renunciation, happiness will follow and suffering will decrease. Trying to follow the path by cultivating these 3 wholesome intentions which will completely change our outlook on the external conventional reality is something that can be practiced in this very life. It can be practiced right now. 

There are some guided meditations for children on BuddhaNet: "Teaching Meditation in the Classroom". 

I would not exactly call that wishful thinking but rather the results from practicing the path correctly (in this life or previous lives). Wanting to meditate or wanting to aid other beings spring from wholesome intentions, i.e. right intentions of good-will. These are path factors. Right intentions-> actions that are based in non-greed, non-hatred, non-delusion, are bound to create wholesome future resultants. So the benefit would be the fact that wholesome actions lead to wholesome results. Experiencing and undertanding that through the practice of insight meditation is a huge benefit. When the mind experiences this over and over it begins to understand causality and how suffering comes to be. If you observe how craftsmen build a house you will see that they lay the bricks layer by layer. The first layer is the foundational layer. The layer everything else has to be based upon. In the practice one of the foundational bricks is right intentions. 

I'm trying to find the sutta in where the Buddha is walking through a forest with his disciples. He then picks up a handful of leaves and says that what he teach is comparable to the leaves in his hand and what he did not teach is comparable to the amount of leaves in the forest. Help would be much appreciated. Lanka 

These five faculties must be balanced in order for one to progress on the path. A common example which Mahasi Sayadaw addresses in his book "Satipatthana Vipassana", p. 11, is the 3rd hindrance, i.e. Sloth and torpor also called Dulness and drowsiness or short Laziness. The Sayadaw explains that laziness happens when there is an excess of concentration and too little energy to fuel or drive that concentration. On the other hand if one has too little concentration and too much energy there will arise restlessness. So these faculties need to be balanced and one way of doing that is to balance sitting with walking meditation. If one's energy faculty is low but concentration high then one needs to arouse energy. There are several ways of doing that. One way is to do walking meditation in a brisk tempo before doing sitting meditation. So to partly answer your question. I think the answer could be based on the need for balancing the five spiritual faculties. Lastly, here is a great dhamma talk by Ajahn Punnadhammo (teaches the Mahasi-method) about how to balance the spiritual faculties. (The website is down at the moment, I will add the link when it becomes available).
