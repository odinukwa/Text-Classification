I take it "strongly" means "in norm"? No, this can fail for reflexive Banach spaces. For a counterexample, let $X$ be the $l^\infty$ direct sum of ${\bf R}$ and $l^2$. (I'm doing this for real Banach spaces, but the same counterexample works in the complex case too.) Thus a typical element of $X$ looks like $(a,f)$ where $a \in {\bf R}$ and $f \in l^2$, and its norm is ${\rm max}(|a|, \|f\|_2)$. Since $X$ is a direct sum of two reflexive spaces, it is reflexive. Now consider the sequence $(1, e_n)$ where $(e_n)$ is the standard basis of $l^2$. It's easy enough to check that this sequence converges weakly, but not in norm, to $(1,0)$. 

Given a totally degenerated abelian variety $A_K$ (to make it easier) over a complete discrete valuation field $K$ with $R$, $\pi$ and $k$ the corresponding discrete valuation ring, uniformiser and residue field. Let $S=\mathrm{Spec}R$ and $S_n=\mathrm{Spec} R/(\pi)^{n+1}$. For any $S$-scheme $V$ we denote the scheme $V\times_S S_n$ as $V_n$. In particular, $A_K$ has semistable reduction, $A_K$ extends to a semiabelian scheme $G$ over $S=\mathrm{Spec} R$, and the corresponding Raynaud extension is just a torus $T$ over $S$, analytically $A_K=T_K/Y_K$, and we have a pairing $Y_K\times X_K\rightarrow \mathbb{G}_{m,K}$, where $Y_K$ is the periods lattice and $X$ is the character group of $T$. Moreover, we assume both $X$ and $Y$ (the character group of the Raynaud extension associated to the dual abelian variety $A_K^{\vee}$ which gives $Y_K$) are free $\mathbb{Z}$-modules. Starting from this, we can construction lots of projective models of $A_K$ by using Mumford's construction, see Mumford compositio 1972, Faltings-Chai's book, the 1999 Tohoku paper of Aleexev and Nakamura. Given a nice (being nice see [Mum1973]section 6) $Y_K$-invariant polyhedral decomposition $\Sigma$ of the affine space $E=\mathrm{Hom}(X,\mathbb{Q})$, we can construct a projective model $P_{\Sigma}$ of $A_K$ and cut out the semiabelian scheme $G$ from $P_{\Sigma}$. Over $S_n$ we have group action $G_n\times_{S_n} P_{\Sigma,n}\rightarrow P_{\Sigma,n}$. Now the question is: could we have an action of $G$ on $P_{\Sigma}$ which extends the group operation on $G$ and the actions on the infinitesimal fibres? It seems to me in Aleexev's 2002 Annals paper, the answer is yes, at least for certain canonical models obtained from a given theta divisor of some ample line bundle (since $A_K$ extends to a stable semiabelic scheme over $S$ once you are given a ample line bundle on $A_K$, and being a stable semiabelic scheme implies you have an action on the model, see Theorem 5.7.1 case 2 in that paper), but I couldn't find a concrete argument for this in the paper. Could anyone help me point out where the hidden argument is? Or give me some other reference. I know in dimension $1$ case, the paper by Deligne and Rapoport describes this action in order to define generalised elliptic curves via a different approach (using $\mathrm{Pic}^0$), but seems not easy to generalise to hight dimensional case. 

Yes, this is standard functional analysis. You're starting out the right way. I'll sketch the argument. First observe that $\phi$ is invariant for the ${\bf Z}^n$ action if and only if it commutes with the multiplication operators $M_h$ for $h(z_1, \ldots, z_n) = z_1^{l_1}\cdots z_n^{l_n}$. By taking linear combinations (and using the fact that the $l_i$ can be negative) this implies that it commutes with $M_h$ for $h$ any polynomial in the $z_i$'s and $\bar{z}_i$'s. Now these polynomials are uniformly dense in the continuous functions on the torus, $C({\bf T}^n)$, so by taking limits we can conclude that $\phi$ commutes with $M_h$ for any continuous function $h$ on the torus. Since $C({\bf T}^n)$ is weak* dense in $L^\infty({\bf T}^n)$, we can now take weak* limits and deduce that $\phi$ commutes with $M_h$ for any $h \in L^\infty({\bf T}^n)$. So we now know that $\phi(1_A) = \phi(1_A\cdot 1) = 1_A\cdot\phi(1)$ for any measurable set $A$, where $1_A$ is the characteristic function of $A$. If $|\phi(1)| > \|\phi\|$ on a positive measure set we can take $A$ to be this set and get a contradiction. That's how you know $\phi(1)$ is bounded. The rest is easy: we have $\phi(h) = \phi(h\cdot 1) = h\cdot \phi(1)$ for any $h \in L^\infty({\bf T}^n)$, and these functions are dense in $L^2({\bf T}^n)$, so we conclude that $\phi = M_{\phi(1)}$ by continuity. There's some work you have to do to check the approximation arguments if you're doing this from scratch, but that's the proof in outline. 

Is an algebraic space over a DVR, whose special fibre (and all its infinitesimal neighborhood) and generic fibre are schemes, actually a scheme? 

In Lemma 1.8, "the equation that cut out the cone at the vertex $(c,A(c))$ are $$x_0-A(c)\geq dA(\alpha(\sigma))(x)"$$ should the equations be $$"x_0-A(c)\geq dA(\alpha(\sigma))(x-c)" ????$$ "then the interior normal in the dual space $X^{\ast}_{\mathbb{R}}\oplus\mathbb{R}$ to the corresponding facet is $(1,-dA(\alpha(\sigma)))$", should this be "$(-dA(\alpha(\sigma)),1)$"??? In the same page, "Definition 1.10 We will denote the minimum of the functions $dA\alpha((\sigma))(x)$ in the above lemma by $\eta(x,c)$." Should we define $\eta(x,c)$ to be the maximum of the fuctions $dA\alpha((\sigma))(x)$???? 

Sitting inside $Hom(P,{\bf N})$ is the set $P^*$ of monotone functions from $P$ into $\{0,1\}$. This set carries the structure of a "Stone lattice", and the normal lattice homomorphisms from any Stone lattice into $\{0,1\}$ will be a poset, in the case of $P^*$ it recovers $P$. In fact I have just described a dual equivalence between the category of posets with order preserving maps and the category of Stone lattices with normal lattice homomorphisms. See Theorem 5.1.3 of my book Lipschitz Algebras. 

It's notable that most of the "bread and butter" mathematical consequences of the axiom of choice are actually consequences of countable choice. (Every infinite set contains a countable subset, a countable union of countable sets is countable, etc.) The Hahn-Banach theorem is a counterexample, but only if you want it for nonseparable spaces, and I can't think of any time I've ever needed this. When restricted to separable Banach spaces it doesn't require any choice principle at all! Whereas the seemingly pathological consequences of choice (existence of nonmeasurable sets, Banach-Tarski, well-ordering of the real line) generally do not follow from countable choice. So the argument from mathematical value seems to me to support countable choice more than full choice. But that isn't a very strong argument, is it? We can't decide whether an axiom is true based on whether we like its consequences. At best it's suggestive. Incidentally, I had the impression when I read Zermelo that he had great polemical skill, but none of his arguments seemed to get directly to the truth of the axiom. He argues for the mathematical value of the axiom. He points out that his critics have themselves on occasion unwittingly used the axiom, which is a devastating point, but has little bearing on the question of truth. (If I'm not mistaken, those unwitting uses were all of countable choice, by the way.) You ask if one should "believe" the axiom of choice, and I think you are right to put the word "believe" in quotes. I feel strongly that set-theoretic assertions are objectively meaningful, but I also feel that philosophers of mathematics have done a very poor job of clarifying what sets are. (Halmos: "A pack of wolves, a bunch of grapes, or a flock of pigeons are all examples of sets of things." Black: "It ought then to make sense, at least sometimes, to speak of being pursued by a set, or eating a set, or putting a set to flight.") If we can't even get that straight, it's hard to come to grips with questions about the truth of questionable axioms. 

The group cohomology of cyclic groups can be computed easily due to the periodity. Now how can one compute the group cohomology $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$? As least in some special case, e.g. $M$ has trivial action, or even $M=\mathbb{Z}$? I would like to know the case that $M$ is not $\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, can one compute $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times\cdots\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$? 

Is there anyone familiar with this paper? It seems to me it contains "some" typos and even some small elementary mistakes, which makes my reading very slow. Of course the key reason for my slow reading is I wasn't familiar with Faltings and Chai's book, from which the paper use the notations and results. Maybe I have some (or many) misunderstanding. I hope someone could help me clear up my confusions: 

I don't completely understand the question, but I would answer "no". If you take $f = 1$ and $u = S = 0$ then you get the operator $Av = -{1\over 2}v'' + v'$, which is not even formally symmetric. I'm especially confused by the motivating example, where the inner product seems to depend on the vector $v$. 

I used Mayura Draw to create approximately 100 illustrations for the second edition of my book on Lipschitz algebras, and I was really happy with it. 

Virtually everything stated in the question is wrong. The Kadison-Singer problem has been solved positively by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava, see: $URL$ The question apparently also refers to an earlier paper of Akemann and me, in which assuming CH we falsified a different conjecture of Kadison and Singer. This problem also has to do with pure states on $B(H)$ so there is some connection with the well-known Kadison-Singer problem. But it's a different question. See: $URL$ 

should be not true! What is the cokernel of the map $\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow A$ with $A$ an abelian variety and $\mathbb{Z}$ the constant group scheme represented by the ring of integers? But if you consider only commutative algebraic group scheme over a field $k$(i.e. of finite type over $k$), then it should be abelian. 

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of schemes (or algebraic spaces), and $s:Y\rightarrow X$ is a section to $f$, i.e. $fs=1_{Y}$. Question: Is $s$ an (closed) immersion? 

In Raynaud's paper "Specialisation du foncteur de Picard", Theorem 3.3.1 says that algebraic group spaces, which are locally of finite type and separated over any locally noetherian normal 1-dim scheme, are group schemes. On the other hand, relative Picard functors for proper flat finite presentation schemes $f:X\rightarrow S$ over DVR such that $f$ is cohomologically flat are represented by algebraic sapces, but are often not schemes, see also that paper or the book Neron Model. 

Is this the statement you want: any locally constant, compactly supported function from ${\bf Q}_p^n$ to ${\bf C}$ is uniformly approximated by linear combinations of products $f_1\cdots f_n$ where each $f_i$ is a locally constant, compactly supported function from ${\bf Q}_p$ to ${\bf C}$? Yes, this follows from the Stone-Weierstrass theorem for locally compact Hausdorff spaces. The linear combinations in question constitute a self-adjoint algebra of functions which separate points and separate each point from infinity. Therefore they are uniformly dense in the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity on ${\bf Q}_p^n$. 

Let me add one more edit to help explain why this is a serious question. Theorem 5 below is a sort of lattice version of Urysohn's lemma, and it has essentially the same proof. Theorem 6, the famous theorem of Raney characterizing completely distributive lattices, is an easy consequence of this result. In other words, a result of basic importance in lattice theory is somehow at heart "the same" as Urysohn's lemma. But "the same" in what sense?
