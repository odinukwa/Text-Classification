Make a nearly instantaneous non-intrusive molecular resolution 3d scan of a large object. Store the location, momentum, and charge, of every molecule for future retrieval. Reassemble the object near-instantly using that data 

In either case, I can think of a few interesting features of such a society: No family units. Since plants have almost no control over breeding, there wouldn't be families. Sexual prohibitions would not exist, generation differences would not be nearly as obvious. Genders roles would be more balanced. Mixed races could be an interesting social problem (half-sentient plants?), though many plant combinations can't produce viable offspring. Relationships. Inter-plantain-ial relationships could get interesting. "Hermit" plants by choice would probably be rare, but once you're in a group, you're pretty stuck. Plants would have great emphasis on applied psychology and conflict resolution skills. Reduced desire for exploration. Because plants need water, huge swaths of the world would remain unexplored, at least until specially engineered plants with water-carrying abilities could explore rockier/less rainy areas. Maybe this wouldn't become a cultural norm, but it would be the initial mindset. So what would plants do? Plants really wouldn't have the "survival struggle" animals have. Food production is pretty passive. There would be a high emphasis on proper shelter (windbreaks, erosion prevention, temperature stabilization). Aesthetics would be important. Lots of thinking would occur, so plants would focus on philosophy before applied sciences. "Thought is cheap, action is expensive" would probably become a mantra. No need-based economy. Because food is free, and necessities are minimal, the focus wouldn't be on needs as much as on services (like a doctor for when you get buried in a landslide). Maybe plants are the perfect candidates for a communist system. Honestly, I don't see anything that can fly a spaceship being very plant-like. That's probably just the limits of my imagination, but a plant's sheer mass-to-movement ratio seems to preclude the rapid responses needed to develop early flight. But, they'd be tough to beat. Once they came to a new world, seeding it could be done easily, and from a high altitude. And plants are notoriously tough to kill. Especially since they have the advantage of cell walls and the ability to regenerate from small pieces. 

How far off would this technology be: I am inclined to think that such technology would not be feasible for the foreseeable future. Take a closer look at what's involved in transporter technology: Physical: 

That is assuming that consciousness/memory is stored solely in finite physical brain states (I guess that's a plausible assumption for sci-fi). Now, we can do 3d scans of objects, but as far as I know these are either intrusive or have very limited knowledge of inner layers. And even relatively "simple" organs, like the liver, would need to be assembled instantly to prevent damage. Imagine trying to "3d-print" a liquid like stomach acid or the blood stream! And you'd need to assemble many compounds in place from their constituent atoms due to the short shelf life. Memories would have to be stored as ions in precise locations (at precise speeds) within the brain. What would happen to such clones Assuming you have the level of technology to do those things, I would assume it would be easier to "print" the necessary information into the brain of existing humans (learn while you sleep). But your question is more interesting. I think one likely scenario is that the clones are transported back into the "Database" and their memories merged (or not) back into the "original". Such beings would not legally exist as distinct entities and would remain the property of their original. Of course, you could end up with a scenario like Calvin and Hobbes. 

The most logical place to find these things is an aquatic environment. Maybe a hot spring or volcano...oh wait, what about a hydrothermal vent? But it's also possible that the roles could be reversed - the "leaves" gather the materials, but chemosynthesis and waste production occurs in the roots, where it is carried away by ground water. In that case, you'd need some noxious metallic gas floating around, like maybe next to a volcano. Finally, if all the need materials are available in the ground, you might see very spidery root systems, with only minimal structures to support flowers/fruits above ground for reproduction. In any case, not somewhere readily habitable by humans. What would the plants look like? I think you'd still have leaf structures, but they'd be more mesh than solid material, with lots of frills to grab the (fill in element here). Roots would probably be similar. Plants would not be green. Most likely you'd see rust-colors, and the plants would "blanch" when they run low on materials. Presumably there would be an ecosystem that would use the plant waste. 

The phase speed is determined by the time it takes the moon to orbit. Here is a table of orbital periods. As you can see, there is a huge range in the length of "months." Callisto, for example, is roughly the same size range as our moon and has a 16 day orbital period. Now, in order for the phases of the moon to affect society, you'll need 2 things: 

At the equator an mountain range ringed the planet. The lowest pass was over 30,000 feet. While the existence of another hemisphere had been postulated for centuries, it could not be confirmed. Even with the invention of air travel, the prop planes could not be controlled as they approached the mountains due to the extremely powerful updrafts and constant thunderstorms on the slopes of the range. For ages past, skeletons, well preserved corpses, and the occasional insane, haggard man were found on the slopes of the mountains. It was postulated that there were villages high in the mountains, filled with strange creatures. Those who found them often died of strange and painful diseases, and in Medieval times armies were sent to locate and destroy the source of the plague. Every decade or so, explorers attempted to climb the mountains. Few expeditions returned, and those who failed and came back often returned only to be sent to asylums, reduced to vegetables by hypoxia and cerebral edema. Bulky air tanks and other supplies were destroyed in freak accidents - but expeditions continued. Mines were established in the mountains to locate rare metals needed for industry. These were used as refueling stations for the explorers as the deep mines had more air than the surrounding area. Some attempts were made to tunnel through the mountain, but miles of tunnels were met with no sign of an end, and the rapid geological changes caused frequent cave ins. Measurements of seismic activity suggested that the mountains did end (it wasn't all a plateau), but more than 200 miles of tunnel would be needed to reach the other side. The first contact had been accidental. It was inexplicable interference on the wireless telegraph - at first attributed to atmospheric perturbations, and later determined to have a pattern. It took decades to establish 2 way communication because of the intense lightning storms in the vicinity of the mountains - eventually, it was determined to use a series of repeaters around the planet to bounce messages off of the upper atmosphere at sunset. Over time, both sides learned the others' language, and departments were set up in governments on both sides to establish relations with "the other side." Treaties led to information sharing to help the unseen allies, and wars one side led to diplomatic actions and even open fighting (see the French and Indian War in our own world). The discovery that there was habitable land on the other side of the mountains, and that it was habited by people similar to them led to an immediate race for allies. A complex information-sharing system developed, where allies would research projects together and use espionage to tip the balance of power. A highly efficient technical pidgin developed, using simple electromagnetic pulses to encode information for allies on the other side. Doctors looked at schematics of devices sent across and determined that those on the other side were the strange mountain creatures of old. [... Stuff happens ...] Someone managed to develop a proxy to link the two internets. Super nerds developed the stack and began to form professional relationships. Facebook adapted easily, as most relationships were between people who had never met anyway... [... more stuff ...] Eventually it was determined that technologies had advanced enough to allow representatives of the two sides to meet in relative safety. It had been put off until the mid 21st Century (relatively speaking of course) because scientists were aware of the health risks of contact with such an alien species. The governments of two of the leading powers on each side determined to send a representative in space flight on a one-way trip to the other side, to become a permanent ambassador. This was scheduled to take place on the solstice, and the ambassadors would be monitored carefully by medical staff to determine what further contact was possible. While perfect peace was impossible, the fragmented nations of both sides meant that local wars kept the peoples fighting those of their own kind, with technical assistance to allies on the other side. The ability to move any kind of fighting force across the divide would not be developed until manned space flight became cost effective. By that time, both sides possessed the technology to easily eliminate each other, so peace was the general rule. 

Numerous. They need to have enough representation and range that small scale eradication campaigns will not have too much impact. Distant. While they may periodically interact with people, they will need to live at some distance so that they aren't a regular threat. Moderately destructive. A dragon that wipes out villages will draw too much attention to itself and become a target for questing and such. A smaller creature that kills the town drunk when he's out too late or drags off a few cattle won't stir widespread hatred. Flying. Really helpful for eluding capture, but not necessary. 

I'll take a stab at this. I'm not a climatologist, and it's hard to make an educated guess because there's nothing at this scale ringed by mountains on earth. How did these mountains come to be? What kind of tectonic activity could create this type of landmass? These will be generalizations, because obviously many climates exist within a three thousand mile radius. Winds At Sea: The Doldrums. Around the Equator there's an area of low wind, where it's very humid and the air just sits. Around the equator is the intertropical convergence zone where airflow is vertical rather than horizontal. The landmass will cause uneven heating, which will create some alternating breezes depending on the time of day, but the overall wind from the ocean will be negligible. On the continent, winds will be driven by albedo differences combined with the Coriolis effect since there are no oceans or waterbodies. The continent is very large, so within the mountain ranges, there will be winds, though they won't have time to pick up speed like they do over the ocean. I would expect a clockwise gyre inside the mountains, sucking up a bit of moisture from the openings. At higher latitudes, the continent's shores and mountains will be forested and very moist. It will rain all the time. High winds will be the rule, with frequent thunderstorms. These storms will spawn hurricanes on the landmasses on the other side of the oceans. Depending on the placement of the gaps, they could profoundly impact the continent's weather. If they're all at the equator, they won't do very much due to the low winds, but if placed in higher latitudes, the low pressure areas created by rising air over the land will divert the moisture laden winds inward. Dry Outer Ring: Dry beaches at the tropics give way to scrub and eventually forested regions at the higher latitudes. Elevated areas go from very dry at the equator to alpine in the high latitudes. The inner portion of the continent will be dry. Not desert dry, because the continent will presumably have springs and some moisture will be sucked into the gyre from the gaps. But, like ratchet freak suggested, probably savanna, like the southern part of Africa (which does have some elevation separating it from the ocean).
