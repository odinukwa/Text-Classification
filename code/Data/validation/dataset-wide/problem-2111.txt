This smells of rack & stack to me. As was previously mentioned in a few comments, your options are a bit limited in my opinion. However, I would mention that these are the types of things you should have also raised or mentioned during your performance review (if you have one). At that time of performance review, you could have asked what you needed to improve upon to reach these goals. If you wish to stay with this company/organization it may be best to have a one-on-one with your direct manager and inquire what they expect of you from your current level in the company, what you need to do to get to the next level and what you can do to better your chances of a raise next review. 

If you're worried about some "blacklist" in which other companies are all going to look at and keep from hiring you, there should be no concern. However, in the event you turn down an offer after a conditional verbal acceptance it's most likely you would not be working for them in the immediate future. I would also advise to discuss this issue with someone in HR to resolve the matter. Every company you work for will have its own case of hiccups and no job will be perfect. 

If you're employed in the United States and are salary, you are most likely at-will employment. Meaning that an employer can terminate the employment for almost any reason. While no one is holding a gun to your head and making you drive into the office on the weekend, be prepared for fallout if you do not. 

Let me warn you of the cautions of using a job offer from company B to leverage a raise out of your current company. If you do this - there could be blow back and the company could get the impression that as soon as a better offer comes or more money is thrown your way you'll bail. Is that the case? Probably not. But some people get antsy and worry. Also, even if a counter-offer is made by company A, it may not be what you were offered by company B. Furthermore when/if reviews/raises come out next cycle don't be shocked to find out that the counter-offer basically negates any raise you would have received. The short version - if the only time the company values you is when you're looking to leave, then it's probably time to leave 

If you and I were discussing this over coffee I would ask you, is it the task that you object to, or the tone? Take the example of emailing something to somebody. I can think of any number of reasons why I ask someone else to email something instead of me: 

I bet you can come up with a few more if you try. See the difference? Try responding once to chitchat from them. Laugh at the joke, "aw" at the baby or puppy, admire the shoes or the plans. Answer with a single sentence when you are asked these sorts of things. Then get back to work. Smile at them. Indicate that you enjoyed the moment of relaxation with them. You don't need to do 8 hours a day of it, or 10 minutes every hour, but in almost all jobs, a few moments a day of collegiality is actively encouraged. It helps teams pull together and support each other. Don't tell them you think they spend the whole day gossiping, or that they should work more, or anything else that might be perceived as judgmental. Ask yourself, "how would I act if I liked these people and enjoyed their company?" Then ask yourself what is keeping you from acting like that for a few minutes each day. Consider doing it, but more importantly, learn about yourself and your workplace from your answer to those questions. 

If I offered someone a bonus, not a regular annual one but a special "we love you, don't ever leave us" one, and they replied with "really? I think you should offer me more than that" I would seriously start to think about what would happen if the person left. I know, it sounds like the retention bonus was because they thought about what would happen if you left, but in many cases people don't get much beyond "it would be a big disruption, let's make sure it doesn't happen." But if you said my $X isn't enough to be sure to keep you around, then I need to really look at what another you might cost, how long it might take to get the new person up to speed, and what would happen while we didn't have an effective person in the role. Now one of two things will happen: 

This isn't totally uncommon. Google for instance was known to give study guides out for a while depending on the req they were looking to fill. It was so you could be well read on the items of discussion and be well prepared. 

Besides the obvious where the company is failing to make payroll or layoffs have started, I would say the increase in meetings is a sign. There are two types of meetings you'll see as the doomsday approaches. The first is the "Drink The Kool-Aid meeting." This is the one where Management knows things are bad, but doesn't want to see any of their top end talent leave. There will be a meeting, probably around lunch, and they'll say how great things are. How people just need to rally and circle the wagons and come out stronger. The second is the "Coming to Jesus" meeting. This is the one where management all sits down and realizes they are in a bad way. You'll see higher ranking people constantly in meetings, shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic. 

Your mileage may vary but I've found the only way to get a decent pay raise in this industry is to switch jobs every several years. At company A despite amazing performance reviews and hitting every mark given and doing great work - the raise was always ~ 1% with different excuses every time. Jump to company B and snag a 15% pay jump. Lather rinse repeat 

Your mileage may vary but after one job of multiple years post college, the GPA is just a bit superfluous. 

I think it depends on the person, management and the organization. I've seen it go both ways as I think many others have. A former developer I worked with was not performing up to task. He was given the dreaded PIP - and from there shifted over to Q&A as an attempt to find a way to use him. 

I think if your employer is unhappy with anything, they will tell you or signal you during normal work interactions. It's not hard to know if you are performing well or not, either at work or in a relationship. If you are fishing for compliments, don't waste your time. Here is what I want in a periodic review. 1) What can I do to carve out some time, on the job, to explore areas of interest to me that I in my own judgement think might benefit the company. 2) Can we set some learning goals that will improve my mastery of the skills that the company needs me to perform well. 3) How would we define my work and performance in terms of the purpose of the work I do in these key areas: Customer experience, advancement of the organization, value to my fellow employees. A discussion that outlines these important factors that are shown to directly link to your job satisfaction and the quality of your contribution to your company is far more important than a blow by blow evaluation of some past actions. Don't focus on past actions in discussion with your manager. Focus on the future. In your daily work, do your best and whatever it takes to deliver for your customers, company and coworkers and you'll never have to worry about the past. 

I am a former employer who has founded 3 businesses and hired hundreds of people. I agree that both of those negative experiences don't reflect on your suitability as an employee, but strongly suggest you provide that information to your prospective employer. Here is why. Background check, criminal records check, financial records check, social media review... Smart employers do every background check you can imagine, including a hiring specialist to mine social media. A huge red flag to any employer is deceit on the resume'. That includes errors of omission as well as commission. It is more than certain that both of those short term employments will show up somehwere, and then you'll be ruled out in the finals, where the serious money is spent on background checks. Bringing a bad candidate into a business is detrimental and expensive. Every savvy employer has learned that the hard way. Money invested in investigation before the hire is money well spent and many candidates are ruled out and never know why because it does not help the employer to tell you. We regularly ruled out people for bad credit etc, because employees bring all those messy personal problems to work, like it or not. Sadly, all these other answers are suggesting that you intentionally hide something and that's called lying... Living with deceit is not comfortable for you and that shows in your question. Besides, you can be let go on the spot if it is later learned that you lied on your resume' Be up front. You'll find a match and you won't be looking over your shoulder wondering when your "secret" will be found out. Good luck! You'll find a good job. 

Sure, more mature and responsible staff could probably have stayed an hour or two some nights to let the traffic die down and whiled away the time online without ever causing a problem. But once a problem was caused it had to be addressed. Our policy was simple in the end: 

Now, these reasons may not apply in your case, but the task vs tone issue is, had the director said to you: 

You are entitled to the time off, that's for sure. But that doesn't mean you're entitled to next Wednesday off, if you have plenty of coworkers who will be away that day, or the last week of December, or all of June. You need to co-ordinate the specific dates with your company. That's why there is an element of asking. (Also: you haven't earned it by doing a great job or by being the only person who does what you do. You have earned it by breathing. Don't burn yourself out and then ask for a medal for that. PTO is a benefit for everyone and you should take it.) The unwritten rules at your firm seem to be that you can use these days: 

Is a request, acknowledges that they couldn't have known, is about you and asking them to accommodate your difference, and offers an alternative (always better than just "don't X.") Signs are useful only in the absence of the sign-writer. Since I doubt people are stopping by to touch your screen when you're away, you don't need them. Deep sighing and conspicuous screen cleaning will make people feel bad, but if you're distracted by a smudge someone left, go ahead and clean it the moment you notice it, even if that's the moment the person left it. And practice asking repeatedly (with the sorry from time to time, with the explanation from time to time, with the please every time) that they don't do that. Finally, model this behaviour yourself. Don't touch other people's screens. Demonstrate that it's possible to discuss code without leaving smudges. And if your coworkers care more than you do about chairs or whiteboard markers or putting garbage in someone else's garbage can or whatever, be super cool and understanding about that. Work towards having an office that cares about each other, foibles and all, and wouldn't find it funny to deliberately upset a coworker by doing something you know they don't like. 

The question isn't stupid - if they ask you to think out the whole process as they want to see how you approach the problem. Mostly from an optimization standpoint. But ya, think about it from an optimization standpoint. Think out-loud, whiteboard, whatever and keep thinking "can I do this better?" 

You just have to spin up a bunch of nonsense that you probably don't mean. Something like, "While I am grateful for the opportunities that were presented to me during my time here - I feel that at this juncture its best for all parties if I move on" Then say something about how you will do all you can to transfer knowledge and help in the transition prior to your departure Then in your exit interview you say a bunch of nice things and leave. 

You should be OK if you gave a solid reason when you declined at the end. In theory a hiring manager would rather hire someone that's there for the long haul instead of taking the job and then leaving 3 months later due to external factors like relocation. You acknowledged there was an issue and did your best to resolve it. If your skills are in line with what they are looking for, there shouldn't be an issue. IF there is an issue, then perhaps it's not the best place for you to wind up. 

As an employee you have no reason to provide "loyalty" to an employer as employment is at-will. They could terminate you for just about any reason at any moment, so the thought that leaving them high & dry shouldn't be your concern. Evaluate the pros & cons of leaving and go from there. Sometimes the grass is greener, sometimes it isn't. 

I am aware that these form a contradiction of sorts. If I am irritated at being interrupted, I may refuse to answer in the hope of reducing future interruptions, even though those refusals bother me a lot. But I try not to, because then I am being that person who gives a ten sentence speech about where the information is and how important my time is, instead of just answering the question. People say that answering will just encourage them to ask - that isn't always a bad thing. If your information is not as accessible as it should be, asking reveals that. Resisting the urge to refuse to answer, or answer only with where to find the answer, the more mature approach is: 

And don't say any more than that. Possibly mention that you'll make up the time by staying late, but don't volunteer what the appointment is for. Of course, you'll be asked "What kind of appointment?" but you don't need to answer. Practice saying "it's personal, and I can't miss it." Practice saying "I know it's inconvenient. I can't move it." [Notice the absence of but in these sentences - say them with and without but out loud and observe how much more powerful they are without it.] Consider saying "it was inconvenient for me to come in last Saturday but I did; I'd appreciate a little flexibility here." Stand your ground and go to your appointment. I sincerely doubt that you will come in at 11 to find you have been fired. Will people suspect it's a job interview? Almost certainly, though it could as easily be a marriage-counselling appointment, a meeting with your parole or probation officer, or a trip to the divorce lawyer's office. There are plenty of things for them to suspect. If they think it's a job interview, will they take that into account when promoting or reviewing you? Yup, though it might have a good or a bad effect in those cases, and besides you don't plan to be around long enough to get a promotion or even a review. Will you be given a terrible reference for no reason other than you (without lying) took personal time for a job interview? No. Not at any place whose references are of any value.
