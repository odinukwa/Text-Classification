My girlfriend has recently bought her first road bike. While the frame size is pretty much spot on and comfortable for her, she finds that the brakes are difficult to use and she ends up with pain in her hands after longer rides. I think the issue arises because when she has the top of the hood in between her thumb and forefinger, her fingers only just reach the levers. Has anyone else encountered this problem, and what have you done to fix it? 

However, as well as special rights, we should expect that there are also specific responsibilities for us cyclists. Again, in Australia, we are not allowed to ride more than two abreast in a traffic lane. 

Bikely is an application built on top of google maps that supports importing GPX files and displaying height profiles. 

A friend of mine goes to the trouble of installing a grease nipple in the shell of each hub. Then, instead of having to take the hub apart, all you need to do is pump more grease in every so often and wipe the excess that comes out around the axle away. This has the advantage of pushing any dirt and gunk out of the bearings when you add more grease. 

If your rim has a few wobbles to it, you may need to wind the barrel adjuster out a bit more when you set the tension. 

I think there is a clear difference between when you can legally use pedestrian facilities and when you should use pedestrian facilities. Here in Australia, you can only legally use pedestrian facilities such as footpaths (sidewalks for all the USians out there) when you are a minor (under 18), accompanying a minor or if it is marked as a shared path. However, I think that cyclists should use pedestrian facilities when they feel that using the road is beyond the level of risk that they are comfortable with accepting. Having made the decision to use the pedestrian facilities and potentially be breaking the law, it is then the cyclists responsibility to make sure that they are not increasing the risk for pedestrians. For me this includes: 

Ok, a number of the other responses have captured some of the possibilities here. The possible causes and fixes I can think of are: 

Finally, as others have mentioned, consider the impact of your actions on the opinions of other road users. 

So, in short, if you've got a mountain bike, there is probably not much of an issue using the service station pump. If you've got a road bike, do yourself a favour and buy a decent track pump. That way you'll be able to top up the tyres quickly each time you go out, and enjoy the benefits of nicely inflated tyres. 

An approach that can give you some confidence is to measure your existing bike(s) along the critical dimensions to see how they compare. To my mind (and apparently also to the mind of the late, great Sheldon Brown) the most important dimension to consider is the top tube length. Basically, you can get a certain amount of adjustment in "reach", the distance between your saddle and the handlebars by adjusting the saddle on the rails, and the stem you've got, but the range of variability is quite small. Seat posts can be extended through quite a significant range, and you can generally play around with the rise on the stem, as well as the spacers on the steerer to get a lot of vertical adjustment. So, download your specifications for the cross-check and we find that the top tube has an effective length of 570mm. Go out and measure the top tube of your current bike (or a bike you are comfortable riding) and if it is close to this, then you are good to go. 

It's hard to tell, but what you are describing does not have to mean that anything is broken. The most likely cause would be improper adjustment of the rear derailleur. It may seem outrageous after two tune ups from two different shops, but you have little to lose in at least trying. Oh, and you will not need your box of tools for this, sorry! Watch this video. Pay attention to the last part, the barrel tension adjustment, which I think may be what's bugging you. Although the website you linked says your bike is equipped with SRAM, Shimano has a detailed procedure to adjust that tension, which you may want to follow: as far as I know all brands work more or less the same. The document I have linked is for a random rear derailleur, but the SIS adjutment part, which is the only one you should worry about, is the same for all. If you can't get it to work, then I would recommend getting it to a bike shop. I would think that any of the two you have already been to should at least take a look at it without charging you anything. 

As others have pointed out, this is unlikely to bear any resemblance to the actual resistance at 80 rpm, but if you wanted to turn your numbers into watts, the formula would be: 

This morning during my morning commute I had an unintended lesson in fixie skidding: I dropped the chain, it got stuck between the cog and the hub and locked the wheel. I'm not sure where that skill came from, but I managed to come to a controlled stop without falling, crashing into the curb, or swerving into traffic. Scary, I must admit. I was only a few blocks from work, so after a good deal of not-so-gentle pulling I managed to dislodge the chain, get it on the chainring and cog and get going. I did notice during the short remainder of the trip that if I applied back pressure on the pedals, the cog was no longer being held in place by the lockring. Not that I understand how that could have happened, but other than that and the terrible skid mark on the tire, nothing else felt wrong. Once I get home I will get a new tire on (kids, put brakes on your fixies, if only for financial reasons!), tighten the cog and lockring, check them for damage, measure the chain to see if it needs replacement, and make sure it sits a little more taut. Am I missing anything? Not sure if I should be looking at anything on the hub, spokes or elsewhere... Update I spent some time with my back wheel today. The spokes are all dented and scratched, but the wheel is holding up well. I took the lockring and cog off, and they both looked fine, same with the threads. After cleaning them up and putting some grease on the threads, I put the cog back in and tightened it with no problems, but when I was tightening the lockring it disintegrated: it obviously cracked during the chain jam, which allowed it to move out without stripping the threads. I am riding on the flop side of the wheel now, which has made for an interesting discovery of forgotten feelings. I had been thinking of taking a tooth off my back cog for some time, so I'll just go ahead an order the whole pack: cog, lockring and chain. 

I've use glueless patches for a number of tube repairs and have found them to be just as durable as the glued patches. 

I've been slowly going through the process of converting my old hardtail mountain bike into a commuting bike. One of the things that I'd like to do is to fit a chain guard so that I can ride the bike while wearing long trousers and not have to worry about chewing up the trouser cuffs. A complication is that the bike (like most mountain bikes) is fitted with both front and rear derailleur gears. I'm not keen to replace these with an internally geared hub system as I have been trying to keep the changes relatively modest in their cost. Are there chain guards that you can add to bikes with derailleur gears? 

@darkcanuck has the right idea with his explanation. Adjusting brakes is easiest if you've got a friend to help you or a "third-hand" tool that you can use to hold the brakes all the way in while you adjust the cable. The basic process that I'd follow for setting up brakes is: 

I think the answer is definitely yes, and this is certainly the case in Australia. Of the three examples you have cited, two of them are explicitly allowed under the road rules for cycling: 

I found William Nealy's books to be quite good when I was learning how to mountain bike. They are a bit old now, but many of the fundamental techniques are the same, and the graphic presentation really helps to get the "image" of the skill into your head. Mountain bike!: a manual of beginning to advanced technique 

Yes you can ride home with a broken spoke. I'd probably unscrew the spoke from the nipple before doing so, so that it doesn't wobble around and get caught in other bits of the bike. Bike wheels are wonderful things that can easily put up with having a few spokes missing. 

As per the other responses, the main tool you need is a spoke wrench. You can use the frame itself as a truing stand. Other things to note are: 

Finally, consider the fact that there are many low quality frames out there that do the job just fine as a bike. High quality is not a necessity for a frame to build up to a perfectly usable and long lasting bike. 

Balance, working on your low speed balance by practicing track stands and the like will mean that you are less likely to need to put a foot down, and more likely to be able to recover from a brief "halt" in your progress. 

Weight distribution is critical, and it is a bit of a fine balance, much like doing a track stand. I find that it is easiest to do this by staying seated and crouching towards the front of the bike. Standing on the pedals will tend to put your weight too far forward and make it difficult to achieve smooth power transfer to the wheels. Smooth Power Transfer is another important aspect. Remember that your rear wheel only has a small amount of friction keeping it from slipping. What you are trying to do is keep the pressure on the pedals strong enough to keep you going up the hill, but not so strong as to make the wheel spin. Things that can help with this are:
