This is local, of course. So $R \leftarrow S : \phi$ is an injection of domains, and $I \leq S$ is a nonradical ideal; is $R \phi(I)$ a nonradical ideal of $R$? Say $s$ descends to a nonzero nilpotent of $S/I$. Then $\phi(s)$ will likewise be nilpotent in $R / R\phi(I)$, and the injectivity says it will be nonzero. 

"Why" is the flag manifold masquerading as a product of ${\mathbb P}^1$s? More concretely, we know that the two varieties lie in the same connected component of the Hilbert scheme of this projective space, by Hartshorne's thesis. Can one connect them without breaking the $T$-action? (As far as I know, Hartshorne connectivity doesn't hold in general if you keep track of the multigrading, not just the single grading.) Since the two varieties are both smooth, (EDIT:) and have different topology, there won't be a flat family over an irreducible base in which one is a general fiber, one the special. Do they have a common degeneration? Hartshorne's thesis just guarantees that we can degenerate, deform, degenerate, deform, ... to get from one to the other, not that they will be on adjacent components of the Hilbert scheme. 

Warning: there is another (non-closed) subscheme $$ GGMS(C) := W(C) \cap \bigcap_{S\in C} \{p_S \neq 0\}$$ called the Gel'fand-Goresky-MacPherson-Serganova stratum. In general $W(C)$ is not the closure of $GGMS(C)$. In particular, $W(C)$ is only empty when $C$ is, whereas $GGMS(C)$ is empty unless $C$ is a representable matroid. 

Let $\Gamma$ be a finite subgroup of $SL_2({\mathbb C})$, and $Q$ the set of its irreducible representations. McKay makes $Q$ into a directed graph by having $V \to W$ if $W \leq V \otimes {\mathbb C}^2$, where the latter comes from the natural action of $\Gamma$ on ${\mathbb C}^2$. (But since ${\mathbb C}^2 \otimes {\mathbb C}^2$ has an $SL_2$-invariant hence $\Gamma$-invariant vector, the directed graph is actually undirected: each edge comes with its reverse.) In this way we get a graph with a vector space at each edge. McKay observes that the graphs so arising are exactly the simply-laced affine Dynkin diagrams, with the trivial rep as the affine node. (In particular, the extra symmetry of the affine diagram comes here from $(\Gamma / \Gamma')^*$, which is therefore identifiable with $Z(G)$, for $G$ the corresponding simply-connected Lie group. I wonder if there's some larger correspondence there... but that's not my question.) If we toss that node, and orient the edges (i.e. throw out half), we can look at the "roots", or indecomposable representations, of the resulting quiver. McKay observes further (in effect) that the largest such quiver representation has the same-dimensional vector spaces as in the first construction. But now, since it's a quiver representation, there are maps between the spaces. So my question: 

What are the commutation relations between the $(e_i)$ and the $(e_i^T)$? I presume that the algebra of operators on $Symm$ so generated is the Heisenberg algebra (on infinitely many generators) acting on its Fock space. How does one write the differentiation operator $\frac{d}{db_i}$ in terms of the $(e_i,e_i^T)$? What is a good reference for this presentation of the Heisenberg algebra? 

The direct sum over $n$ of the total homology of the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points in the plane. (Reference: Nakajima's book.) The (stably-almost-)complex cobordism ring of a point. I expect that's pretty close to the power series thing you mentioned, via the connection to the universal formal group law. (I wonder if there are nice manifolds corresponding to the Schur functions?) 

This paper by Agnihotri and Woodward uses a Narasimhan-Seshadri correspondence between parabolic bundles and unitary connections to determine the possible spectrum of a product of two (special) unitary matrices of known spectrum. They start with a triple of unitary matrices with product $1$, N-S relate that to bundles on $\mathbb P^1$ with parabolic structure at three points, classify those bundles as maps of the $\mathbb P^1$ into a Grassmannian, and end up at quantum Schubert calculus of Grassmannians. Maybe not the most obviously natural source of parabolic bundles, but a wonderful application. 

That particular example is about branching from $SO(5)$ to $SO(4)$. In general, the branching rule from $SO(n)$ to $SO(n-1)$ is multiplicity-free and well-known; it's in, e.g., Zhelobenko's book. So the corresponding nonabelian DH measure on the nonabelian moment polytope will be some $1/N$ multiple of Lebesgue measure. The "intricacy" they point out there is that the intersection with $t^\ast$ is nonconvex. But basically, intersecting with $t^\ast$ is a silly thing to do: if you push forward Liouville measure along the moment map $M\to g^\ast$, you get a measure on $g^\ast$ that you can't "restrict" to $t^\ast$. Rather, the natural thing is to push forward again along $g^\ast \to t^\ast_+$, dividing by the coadjoint action. And there, the image is indeed convex, by Kirwan's nonabelian convexity theorem. (That doesn't give the right definition of nonabelian DH measure, though -- you have to divide the result by the volume polynomial that gives the volume of the coadjoint orbits. If $M$ is itself a coadjoint orbit $G\cdot \lambda$, you want to get a Dirac delta at $\lambda$, not that times the volume of $G\cdot \lambda$.) You asked for another intricacy. One is that the vertices of the moment polytope that lie on the walls of the Weyl chamber are much stickier to interpret than the ones in the interior; there's no simple description of the moment polytope as a convex hull. One hint of this is that even if $M$ is prequantizable, the vertices on Weyl walls may not be at lattice points. 

I'm going to vote for Guillemin and Pollack's chapter of "Differential Topology". Basically, a k-form should be something that you can integrate over k-dimensional submanifolds. And it shouldn't matter how you parametrize them. That means that there should be determinants baked in to the definition, since those measure how the volume changes when you change coordinates. The determinant of a matrix negates when you switch two rows, so a k-form should be antisymmetric this same way. That's pretty much it. 

If $G$ isn't simply connected, then $G(F)$ isn't connected, so $G(F)/I$ isn't connected. Your question is about resolving those $\overline{IwI}/I$ that live in components other than the one containing the basepoint $I/I$. On such a component $C$, there will still be a closed $I$-orbit $X_C$, automatically smooth. (In the familiar case, $X_C = \{ I/I \}$.) Generalize the Bott-Samelson-Demazure-Hansen resolution to $P_{\alpha_1} \times^I \cdots \times^I P_{\alpha_k} \times^I X_C \to C$. The LHS is smooth, and can be made to resolve any choice of $\overline{IwI}/I$, through suitable choice of $\vec \alpha$. 

Example: let $M$ be the Schubert matroid for a $\lambda \in {n\choose k}$, i.e. for each $i \notin \lambda, i+1 \in \lambda$, we have a connected flat $[1,i]$ with rank $|[1,i] \cap \lambda|$. Then $\lambda$ is a smooth base of $M$. And indeed, $\lambda$ is the point in the Bruhat cell whose closure is the Schubert variety $\Pi_M$. 

Am I right in thinking that the relevant weight space is the $\sum_i w_i \omega_i - \sum_i v_i \alpha_i$ of the $\sum_i w_i \omega_i$ representation, where the $(\omega_i)$ are the fundamental weights and the $\alpha_i$ are the simple roots? Edit: I tracked down this formula in Proposition 6.9 of this. If so, can I Can I therefore think of the second set of vertices as Langlands dual to the first set, in any useful way? In particular, has anyone looked into attaching the second set of vertices to one another, to give a second copy of $Q$? (I really want to say "the Langlands dual of $Q$" but I guess we're automatically in the simply-laced case.) 

Your question is about the vectors in $V_1\otimes V_2$ that provide $1$-dimensional $B_\Delta$-subrepresentations of weight $\mu$, where $B_\Delta$ is the diagonal in $B\times B \leq G\times G$. Let's call this subspace $J$. Let $S \hookrightarrow T$ be a regular dominant coweight, and let $B_z := (S(z)\times 1)\ B_\Delta\ (S(z^{-1})\times 1)$. Then $B_1 = B_\Delta$, and $\lim_{z\to\infty} B_z = (B' \times 1) T_\Delta$, where $B'\leq B$ is the unipotent radical; call this limit subgroup $B_\infty$. We can also consider $J_z := (S(z)\times 1)\cdot J$, and its limit $J_\infty$ (computed inside the Grassmannian of $(\dim J)$-dimensional subspaces of $V_1\otimes V_2$). Now I claim that $J_z$ is $B_z$-invariant for each $z$, and hence, $J_\infty$ is invariant under $(B'\times 1) T_\Delta$. Your assumption was that $J$ was not $0$; hence there are vectors of $(B'\times 1) T_\Delta$-weight $\mu$. Call that potentially larger space $J'$. Unlike $B_\Delta$, the limit group $B_\infty$ is normalized by $T\times T$, which will act on $J'$ and break it into weight spaces, i.e. weight vectors of $V_1$ tensor weight vectors of $V_2$. The $(B'\times 1)$-invariance means that the only $V_1$ weight space met this way is the high weight space. Summing up, the assumption that $\mu$ is a high weight in $V_1 \otimes V_2$ implies that $\mu$ can be written as the high weight of $V_1$ plus a weight of $V_2$. One way to rephrase your question was that you were looking for asymmetry. I get it here with this $S(z)\times 1$, whereas Friedrich Knop's crystal-based answer implicitly derives it from the quantum group (for which $V_1\otimes V_2$ is not obviously isomorphic to $V_2\otimes V_1$, especially as $q\to 0$). 

This non-answer grew too long for a comment. Let's change coordinates, $B_i = \check\rho(t)A_i$, where $\check\rho(z)$ is the diagonal matrix $diag(t,t^2,t^3,\ldots,t^n)$. Then the original equations $A_i = A_i^T, A_1+A_2 = A_3+A_4, A_1^{-1}+A_2^{-1} = A_3^{-1}+A_4^{-1}$ become $B_i = \check\rho(t) B_i^T \check\rho(t^{-1})$ and the other two unchanged. If you take $t\to\infty$ then instead of considering symmetric matrices you're considering upper triangular. There's a serious issue that these may not be enough equations to define the limit (may not be "Gröbner enough"), but if they define a complete intersection then (they are Gröbner enough and) the original was a complete intersection. The natural action of $GL(n)$ on the original four matrices, $g\cdot A_i = g A_i g^T$, degenerates/extends to an action of $B\times B$, left and right independent multiplication by upper triangular matrices. Using that we can assume $B_1 = \bf 1$, and still have a conjugation action on the other three $B_i$. So we've reduced to the question, is the space of quadruples $(1,B_2,B_3,B_4)$ of upper triangular matrices, satisfying your original two matrix equations, only $n+1\choose 2$-dimensional. Or even stronger, is (this space)/(the residual $B$-action) only $1$-dimensional. For $n=2$, the resulting space is indeed still a complete intersection, now with 12 components, of degrees {3,3,3,3,3,3, 2,2,2, 1,1,1}. I didn't look into how the original components break into these. 

Well, there's going to be some map $T^* \to H^2_T(pt)$ taking a weight $\lambda$ to the equivariant Euler class of the corresponding line bundle over a point. If you add weights, that tensors the line bundles, so adds the first Chern classes; hence this is an additive map between these two free abelian groups. Since it's natural it's going to be $Aut(T)$-equivariant. Already we see that Atiyah and Bott have to be right, up to scale. 

This extension wasn't very difficult, but if it was known I'd rather give credit to its earlier discoverers. 

Motivation: the poset $K \backslash G/B$ is somewhat mysterious, whereas the poset of "twisted involutions" {$w \in W : (\theta\cdot w)^2 = 1$} is at least less so. I need to sum over chains in this order ideal and would rather do it inside $W$. 

It depends on whether you think of the symplectic form as giving you a map $TX \to T^*X$ or vice versa. When you restrict to $\mu^{-1}(\chi)$, you only have a "presymplectic form", which gets you a map like the above (and not an isomorphism). If you quotient down to $X/G$, you only have a "Poisson tensor", which gets you a map backwards (that isn't an isomorphism). From your desired generalization it seems like you would prefer the latter picture. 

Yes it is simply connected. In general the retraction of $\mathbb C^2$ to $0$ will retract the resolution to the $0$ fiber, which is a tree of $\mathbb{CP}^1$s, hence homotopic to a wedge of $2$-spheres, in this case $k$ of them. 

"Argument involution"? I have never heard a name for the map, and I'm sure I would use "the $z\leftrightarrow z^{-1}$ map" as the name, in a paper. 

Because the proof sketch relies on excising spurious components over $0$ of a Rees family, it sounds like a Gr\"obner basis calculation, but I didn't see which one. 

I apologize for asking questions that seem likely to be answered in Conway & Sloane's "Sphere Packings, Lattices, and Groups" if I knew where to look. Let $L$ be the unique* even unimodular lattice of signature $(10,2)$, and let $\Delta \subset L$ be the vectors with norm-square $2$, called the roots. 

I will answer in the contrapositive. Let $X \subseteq \prod_i {\mathbb P}^{n_i}$ be irreducible of codimension $k$. If whenever $\sum k_i = k$, you can find subspaces $\prod_i {\mathbb P}^{n_i}$ that intersect $X$ in at most one point, then $X$ is called a "multiplicity-free subvariety". In this case Brion has proven that any degeneration of $X$ must still be Cohen-Macaulay: $URL$ and in particular, $X$ itself must be! The case of the diagonal was studied by Cartwright and Sturmfels: $URL$ 

Equivariant quantum cohomology of Grassmannians (presumably not your variety) is closely related to equivariant ordinary cohomology of 2-step flag manifolds. That's some justification, for me... 

I give some hints about computing them in my paper Balanced normal cones and Fulton-MacPherson's intersection theory, section 3. (Also I compute 14 examples.) I find it kind of astounding that this easy and beautiful construction has sat essentially unused in the literature for over 50 years now. There is Rees' book on asymptotic properties of ideals, and the Huneke-Swanson book, but that's almost the entire literature.
