The problem is not naturalism, but your bad epistemological ideas. Those ideas are extremely common, but they are still wrong. You write: 

Yes, they do. They have written books about this stuff. If you want to know about their ideas, you could read what they have to say. 

All knowledge is discovered by conjecture and criticism. You notice a problem, guess solutions to it, criticise solutions until only one is left and it has no outstanding criticisms, and then you move on to another problem, see "Realism and the Aim of Science" by Karl Popper, chapter I. Maths is no different. Proofs do not prove stuff since their assumptions can be wrong, as you have noted. Rather, they provide interesting target practice. They expose ideas about relationships between different ideas to criticism by making them as precise as you know how to make them. Since they are more precise, more can go wrong with them and there is more you can potentially learn by trying to refute them. Sometimes when a mathematical guess is wrong there is some minor modification that fixes it and sometimes there is no such modification. Some ways of doing this are described in "Realism and the Aim of Science" by Karl Popper, Chapter III (this is about maths although the title is "Metaphysics: Sense or Nonsense?", metaphysics by Popper's lights is just knowledge that isn't experimentally testable and that includes maths). the relationship between maths and physics is also interesting in this context. The mathematical operations that it is possible for us to think about are those instantiated in the laws of physics. There may be others, but no physical object, including your brain, can model them. So to discover mathematical objects you conjecture that their properties are modelled by the properties of objects you can measure, like marks on a page or data in a computer. It can turn out that those physical objects don't model what you thought they modelled. The way to discover this is to try to model the same mathematical operation in different ways and see if you get different answers to the same question. See "The Fabric of Reality" by David Deutsch, Chapter 10. But it can also turn out that your ideas about the abstraction your are trying to model are false. If you have results that for which you can't find any other explanation, then you may be in that situation. 

The first formulation: Don't do anything that logic would not allow to be universalized. For example, if everyone stole what they wanted to steal, then no one would recognize property rights so there would be no property, and if there is no property there can be no stealing. So, it is not logically possible to make stealing a universal imperative. 

I'm going to abstract this and call the brain a box. To get a minimum amount of energy you would need to define the properties of the box and its starting state. More specifically, 

What is the difference between an 'idea' and a 'concept'? Has a distinction between the two terms been settled and accepted by most modern philosophers? 

The sentence, The Current King of France is ill, presupposes the existence of an extant French king. That sentence translates to, ∃!x(Kx ⋀ Ix), which is false. Similarly, the sentence, The Wolverine has an Adamantium Skeleton, translates to ∃!x(Wx ⋀ Ax), which is true. Similarly, the sentence, Socrates had a beard, translates to ∃!x(Sx ⋀ Bx), which is true. However, for all I know , Socrates could also reference a fiction. How does logic reference fictional characters? 

Knowledge is based on evidence whereas belief does not need any evidence. I think the "Knowledge hierarchy" is interesting in this case: 

Source: $URL$ But without knowledge that has no further meaning. But you have seen that pattern before. And you have seen the pattern what happens next before: 

so you derived that "dog" is what these patterns mean. And as you know these patterns, you have compresses a lot of information and even more data: You can predict what can happen and what can't. Your predictions might not be always right, but they have to be right most of the time. How do you know they are right? Well, that's another question. One questions that I think is interesting is: Is knowledge always correct? Well, I think here you will get problems with terms. I would call one of them universal knowledge and the other personal knowledge. The universal knowledge does fit to every information all the time. In that sense it cannot be wrong. But it is rather a theoretical construct. We only have personal knowledge as we only have limited data and therefore limited information. As our capacities to detect patterns are limited we also accept errors. So our knowledge has not to fit all information we get. We sometimes simply ignore information (Was that fish just talking? Nah, I have never seen that before. Let's ignore it.) or we actively try to get more information (Did the fish talk again? Probably somebody tried to fool me. Lets seek for hidden cameras.) Humans have developed amazing abilities to get and share knowledge. A good strategy for checking if knowledge is useful / valid is falsification. For everything you know, there has to be some information that had the possibility to change your mind: "If XY happens, then my knowledge about Z is wrong.". So much about knowledge. But what is belief? Belief does not need any data / information / knowledge. When you ask religious people what you could do that would make them not belief in god any longer, you will get one answer: Nothing. No data / information can "remove" belief. Colloquial meaning: I belief Sometimes people say I belief when they are not sure about something. But that's something different. 

The problem I understood the definitions of 'a priori' and 'analytic' to be extensionally identical. The definitions of 'synthetic' and 'a posteriori' that I used here may be different, but I'm doubtful - as it seems to me that there are only two ways of verifying a statement: deduction, and induction. From what I (probably, incorrectly) understand, 'A priori' and 'analytic' refer to 'deduction'; this leaves 'synthetic' and 'a posteriori' to share 'induction'. Yet, people who know more about philosophy than I know about it, and who have thought about these terms more than I have thought about them, seem to be able to distinguish between the two sets of terms. The question What distinguishes 'A priori' from 'analytic'? What distinguishes 'synthetic' from 'a posterior'? Thank you 

That said, it is also important to stipulate what information we have to answer the question? Do we have perfect knowledge? If so, then you know how much energy each person would use developing a given proof, control for the energy consumed at rest and thinking about the proof. The difference multiplied by the time spent thinking about the proof and only about the proof will be the energy used to create the proof. Consider the amount of energy each person consumed in formulating the proof, select the lowest value, and you have the minimum figure for all extant people. 

So let's get through it: Data is only symbols / signs. Data comes from sensors. A simple example is the output stream a visual sensor produces. This sensor might be your eye and the data comes in the form of electrical impulses. Information is data with context and interpretation. In the eye example that could be some structure: Your brain knows that the data it gets is grouped. What arrives at the same time is related; things that are closer together are related. From the different signals of single rod cells an image is formed. So information can only exist with data, but it is more. I would define knowledge as an extrapolation of information. So you try find patterns in information with context. In the eye example I would say that knowledge is the following: You see the following image: 

Among humans? Or among mating organisms in general? Also, in what circumstances? Economically Suppose a couple who value what most people value, and who value those things about as much as most people value them. If they share fixed costs (shelter, utilities, and furnishings), then the arrangement will effect more value for each of them; presuming, living with another person doesn't offset the added value. Otherwise, parasitism better characterizes the arrangement than symbiosis does. Reproductively Whether we ought to regard cohabitating as symbiotic, or regard it as parasitic, depends on the circumstances: Can either party force the other to mate with it? How would doing so affect either party's absolute reproductive success (the number of organisms at an arbitrary future time that will have descended from the ancestor in question)? Game theory explicates this intertesselation well. The game proceeds as follows. First note the following game parameters.
