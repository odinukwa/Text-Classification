There is no universal agreed upon answer, but personally I would be a little Aristotelian about it: art has a purpose, and the degree that it is fit to that purpose is the degree that it is great art. Some would say that the purpose of art is to make our surrounding more pleasant. It is to make us feel good, so we may judge whether lots of people "like" something to determine its value. Under this definition, even a soothing wallpaper pattern or elevator music could count as art, and professional opinion is valueless compared to the aggregation of millions of "likes". Personally I think art is different from decoration, or at least great art is much more than decoration. I have heard a definition of art that art is what the art community says is art. There are various traditions of creating art, and the artists in those traditions can evaluate what is actually part of those traditions. Professional opinion is all that counts as it takes training to evaluate how well a piece of art maintains a particular tradition or not. This is probably a gross simplification of the position, but I'm not happy with this definition, as I think there is a universal and timeless quality to art beyond what a community of artists may define it to be. Some would suggest that the purpose of art is to embody or communicate emotions and ideas, usually in a metaphorical way that gives it a general applicability that prose does not have. When we see great art, we feel something more, or understand something more than we did before, even if we can't say what it is. It is also accessible beyond a select group of people; it tries to communicate with everyone. Art seems to have a language all of its own, and the way that we respond to art is largely determined by the associations we have with art from a similar tradition. These associations are like the language that we have picked up by previously being exposed to art. Some art languages we seem to pick up naturally, just as we pick up our native spoken language. Some languages take more work. In this perspective, we can evaluate art by how well it uses the art languages from the traditions it draws on, and communicates to the desired audience. That audience may be people with only basic art language comprehension, or it may be people who have spent years learning artistic languages. Maybe great art needs to have something to offer both audiences. There is a certain genius to just communicating to people using a small vocabulary, as shown by Dr. Seuss. But it has nothing for highly literate people, so it may be a stretch to call "Fox in Socks" great literature. Likewise, I think a book that can only be read and understood by a select few is no good at communicating, so it can not be great art. Really great art seems to have a quality that allows it to transcend the art tradition in which it is based. It is almost like even if you don't fully understand it; you just know that it has a lot to say. So in that way, we can all judge great art to some extent, but it is good to have people around that can read it properly so we know whether it is really great or whether it is really just a babbling imposter. 

On a temporary basis and as an ongoing personal philosophy selflessness is possible but a consistent selfless life is unsustainable. Selflessness perhaps seen "Universally" or collectively could be seen as good because collectivism inherently blanks-out the individual, but in an individual sense selflessness is bad. All values have to be produced by individuals, so altruism requires a sacrifice of time and effort. To see morality in regards to the daily and your long term goals, as individuals, sacrifice is bad. I do consider benevolence and altruism to be separate concepts. Philosophy qua individualism selflessness is bad. It can mean a few things: material selflessness (the giving of possessions), spiritual selflessness (giving up logic and thought; ie religion), and collectivist ethical doctrine towards the state. 

The first form of language is concept-formation from perceptions, the second is concept-exchange verbally. He cannot teach them, because they cannot understand his concepts as they have not formed them perceptually and consciously like he has. To quote my second favorite philosopher, Leonard Peikoff: 

Numbers on their own represent nothing, one always represents an entity, two and beyond are all groups of entities. It is a matter what entity the number represents. If that entity is for example millimeters then it is an objective unit of measurement, if that unit is some arbitrary mental unit it relates to nothing and the sum is nonsense. 

If it is objective evidence it certainly points toward ~P without objectively proving it - but providing a clue for further inductive investigation. After that, more evidence might be found. Incomplete evidence can still be key to evidence. 

To consider this objectively one must keep in mind when seeing the result of votes, on how they are created. Rationally one must consider that the votes on this site came from its rules, that is, because of them to get votes you have to get reputation and objectively it is just reputation. The system provides an objective valuation as far as the members are being objective. If the majority of the site are objective, the numbers are objective within their own definitions based on their causes: the rules. 

I want to learn logic better, I know a few fallacies but I've read no books mostly just stuff on the Internet. I see them everywhere, but sometimes I don't know what the fallacy is called. I am a pretty decent logician, but I want to learn the terminology well. Where do I start? What books do you recommend? 

Example An example I am aware of is the Torah Codes, in which the birth and death dates of important Rabbis are supposedly encoded close to their names in the Bible. Some very intelligent researchers found extraordinarily strong evidence using recognised statistical techniques, and their results were published in a secular peer-reviewed journal. It had many people convinced for a time, until other researchers demonstrated methodological problems that were the probable source of the amazing evidence. It is likely that the researchers "tuned" their experiment, settling on a sample which confirmed their hypothesis, and then presenting their tuned sample as an independently compiled sample. When you disregard confounding evidence, as is common with religious belief, any statistics that you use as justification for your beliefs is automatically useless. Based on this, I think it is extremely hard to take seriously research done by people with religiously predetermined opinions. Meaning of "Intellectual Honesty" The standard of intellectual honesty is more rigorous than just having knowledge. For instance, true belief does not consititute knowledge. For knowledge it is necessary that a believer have justification to support their belief. But the believer must only be aware of the justification for their belief for it to be knowledge. The belief need not be caused by the justification. In contrast, I don't think that simply having justification constitutes intellectual honesty. It is not just necessary that the believer is aware of the justification, I think they must believe an assertion because of the justification, or at least be open to disbelieving it should the evidence point in the opposite direction. While an (hypothetical) entirely irrational person may have true beliefs and untrue beliefs, none of their beliefs constitute knowledge because the truth of their beliefs is accidental. They do not know (or understand) the difference between their true and untrue beliefs. Likewise, a person with an overriding faith may have justified beliefs and unjustified beliefs. Although they know and understand justification, this time they simply do not care about it. Whether their beliefs have justification or not is accidental, and so the truth of their beliefs is still accidental. Such a person may be very intelligent, and may in other ways be honest, but as the truth of their beliefs is still fundamentally accidental, it can be difficult to trust them. Even without lies, if they do not believe because of justifications, and would not be able to be swayed by justifications, they are still intellectually dishonest. 

There are logical dilemmas. If there is no free will, you can not do any accepting. You have no choice. Acceptance would be an illusion, and you would be simply watching, observing, recording all that is happening. You couldn't even have thoughts about what you were observing because that would require decisions. A solution would be to show people they do have free will. 

Some people claim we never die; that we have eternal souls. Some people claim that we can be born again and/or live multiple lives. Usually these claims involve some catch of living correctly. From a scientific standpoint at this time it would seem the human body lives, once for a finite period of time. Before, and after this, would presumably be an infinite amount of non-life. So I would say choosing to live is rational. 

If one believes they have no free will then the solutions are unreasonable. Without free will, there can be no deciding how to solve problems. Without free will, no one can do anything about anything. For someone who wants to solve problems caused by people believing they do not have free will, there are some good solutions proposed, but they would be difficult to apply on a large scale. Also, excessive law and punishment becomes an infringement on free will, which historically has magnified issues. 

One can visualize abstract ideas. So, at the very least they exist inside the mind. It does not require language to visualize a perfect circle. I don't have to have a language to describe it. If I never met another being, I would still have an image in my mind of circles. There are things which are circular. The image in my mind might be an average of all circular objects I have seen. The image might be a symbol, to myself for myself, and thus a language of symbols which I use to categorize objects in my mind. However, the perfect circle now exists as a symbol in my mind. 

I do this often. I use the word "philosophy" to indicate I am talking about the way I think. I use it to indicate my own personal beliefs and conclusions about the world. It is in a sense a disclaimer at times as, "In my philosophy...", or, "My philosophy is...". In a way I am warning people to take what I am about to say as "something to think about", rather than fact. It might be true and I think it is. I can't prove it to you, maybe it can't be proven, there is evidence though. Another phrase I like to use is, "Philosophically speaking...". Does anyone else do this sort of thing? Is there a better way to start such a statement, in particular with someone who does not study philosophy? What tags should I include for this question?
