Like many prey animals, vision is optimised to detect danger coming from anywhere. They can see you with one eye very easily, and their reflexes are on a hair-trigger to take them away from incoming attack. They can see above them, and all around, with a blind spot to the rear, and a very small one just in front of the nose (which is thought to lead to accidental biting on occasion when feeding squirrels) This diagram is for a rabbit (from vgr1.com) but the squirrel is very similar: 

Your understanding and 'feel' of waves and swell will almost almost certainly help, as will experience of identifying gusts coming in. Being able to carve a board will also be useful. Overall, while you will still need to learn how to handle the kite, your experience windsurfing will shorten your time to proficiency. 

I'd usually go with option 1 unless I was exhausted. If I was too tired I may even have an option 3, which is to return to the bottom, wait a while then fast climb to the top cam and attempt to complete the climb (or let my partner try fresh) 

Various anti-fog products will work. I actually use the Rain-X anti-fog fluid (I had it for the car anyway and tried it successfully) You just need to clean the inside thoroughly, then apply it and it should last an entire season. 

Having suffered similar on a marathon I had to run in freezing rain once (ending up with not just large areas with the skin chafed off entirely, but also deep cuts into my thigh muscles from the stitching!) I can heartily recommend combining very supportive underwear with non-slip, stretch leggings. This way the only rubbing will be between the underwear and the leggings, and not between you and the fabric! By personal preference, UnderArmor provide suitable items of clothing, but there are a wide range available. (While recovering, Vaseline is your friend!) 

The only technique I use is to take out the old ones, draw round them with a sharpie and then cut out to the inside of that line. This works very well, and trimming to make sure the line is just removed gives an accurate measure. 

I tend to think backpacking is one of the cheapest activities to take up, as it takes very little cost to start. Sure, they need some good boots, a rucksack and some warm clothing - but that's all really cheap. They won't need a compass or a stove if they are with you on their first outing - they won't even really need to know much: you can teach them along the way, and that way of learning is really valuable. I, and most people I know who like the outdoors, have spares of pretty much everything else. I know I have 6 tents of differing sizes, many sleeping bags etc so ask friends and neighbours. 

If you have a boom with internal pulleys to increase your purchase then you will find this much more difficult: 

This will vary by individual - the basic recommendation is that once it becomes uncomfortable you should stop. 6 or 7 months sounds about right. By that stage though, the recommendation is also to dramatically lighten the pack you carry anyway, as ligaments get much more elastic by that stage of pregnancy and you can do a lot of damage to your joints. 

I get far too hot but like you I find that layer part of the night gets cold. My solution in temperate climates is to only ever zip the sleeping bag up halfway so the top half is left loose, that way I can pull it over me or off again without waking up. If it is a wee bit cooler you could try this technique as well as a thin sheet or blanket. 

2) How good a swimmer are you, how cold is the water, and how strong is the tide? In cold water even a strong swimmer can find it difficult to make any distance. Try measuring the tide by throwing a small object out into the water and watching it over 10 minutes. In waters around the UK, swimming a kilometre is probably not an issue for a strong swimmer - if the water is calm and the tide is slack. Before setting off try and line up two objects on the far shore so you can assess how much the tide is pushing you off course. 

I am a big fan of the low ankle water resistant Salomon fell-running shoes. The Gore-Tex allows moisture and sweat to escape rapidly, and when worn with wicking socks they actually work well to keep your feet dry and sweat-free. I do most of my hiking in Scotland, which is on a par with New Zealand for precipitation - I would definitely recommend water resistant fell runners, along with multiple pairs of socks. You will be much more comfortable, will have less chafing and blisters and generally be much more comfortable. 

As an interim step, have you tried the Vibram Five Fingers running shoes - these still have protection under your feet, but give a lot of freedom as they are very thin. 

There are three things you should look at here, lung capacity, oxygen carrying capacity and bradycardia reflex. Lung Capacity When I was younger I suffered from asthma, and had a series of lung exercises to improve lung capacity. I can't remember them all now so I checked various sites. This one has some excellent tips, including: 

This is actually very simple. You use them as both a cushioning material and a way to prevent your shoe rubbing on your skin. If you have a problem area, products such as Compeed cushions, mole skin etc work really well, but in an emergency duct tape should work just fine. Just stick them over the area, making sure the edges don't catch on anything in your shoe when you walk. 

Children are a relatively high risk on board a small boat. At 4 or 5 years old they don't know enough about safety, and by their teens they are either convinced that they are invincible, or terrified that they will drown, so at either end of that spectrum there are challenges. 

The concern here would be if the helmet could move far enough that it doesn't protect your skull adequately. If you can move it significantly I'd want to sort it - remember in an emergency it could take a good hit. Personally, I'd replace the entire strap set at this point, as I'd not be convinced any repairs would be strong enough at strap ends etc. I definitely wouldn't rely on gaffer tape... 

Remember to slightly overtighten if you expect rain, as nylon guy ropes stretch a fair bit in the wet. With the one you have, you already have the loop and the slot. Open up the loop and place this over your peg, then slide the black plastic piece up the rope until tight - the mechanism is the same, the friction is just applied a slightly different way. I'll check to see if any of my tents use that type and take a photo. 

But if you do provoke one, all the advice suggests forgetting about swerving - just run fast, and away from water. 

Yes, those do look like a soft hackle of some kind. I don't know which bird, but as long as they are soft they can be useful for a number of purposes. Globalflyfisher.com has some excellent info on specific fly tying, and their page on soft hackle includes this: 

The usual method, and actually the one meteorological offices use the world over is to run multiple models with slightly different parameters. When all the outputs show generally the same result they have confidence in the forecast, and when they come up with different results they have low confidence. They say this on weather reports, often giving percentage chance of rain, cold etc. All you can do is try and look at reports from differing sources and run your own comparison. It is not an exact science by any means, and if you are anywhere near the sea the results could be very erratic. In the centre of a continent, the forecast can be much more predictable, as there are less uncertainties in the modelling - the hard bits are where sea meets land. All you can do is gain a degree of confidence by listening to local experts, national forecasters who use massive modelling runs and taking all of it with a degree of skepticism. Thanks to @RowanHawkins who pointed out that: 

If you have never surfed before, avoid going for a really long one - they are very unweildy, can be difficult to get up to speed, and are a pain to carry back to the car when you are tired out :-) As far as width goes - can you sit up comfortably on it? And can you fit it under your arm? Islesurfboards in California have this chart, which is a pretty good starting point: 

If it is heat that causes her hives then the main goal is to wear cooling clothes like light linens. That is about all there is to it. 

These will cause the leech to quickly detach, but it will also regurgitate its stomach contents into the wound, possibly introducing disease! 

The simple answer is yes, you can definitely use waste paper or cardboard to stop an arrow. Various folks have used cardboard boxes, flattened, and piled up to anywhere between 6 and 12 inches thick, held together with straps or duct tape. You'd need to use trial and error to find out what thickness works for you - if you compress the cardboard tighter you don't need as great a thickness - but if it is standard paper waste, rather than cardboard boxes, you'll possibly need double the thickness to start with. 

I have a couple of extra points that were always relevant for us as kids growing up in an extremely tidal area (peaking at 16knots - 30mph!): 

You try to avoid going in the water yourself unless absolutely necessary, but the 5 options above should all be looked at in order. 

Of the three possibles I came up with from your description (wagtail, oystercatcher and lapwing), wagtail was ruled out by its size, and you would have seen an oystercatcher's beak as they are pretty bright (and oystercatchers don't have a swooping flight) - the only one that matches correctly is the lapwing. It is black and white and has very squared off wings. On the ground the crest of feathers is obvious, but in flight the flash of white on the underside of the wings and the swooping display flight pattern are quickly identifiable. 

Although I had originally thought Wikipedia had a good list, nivag pointed me in the direction of walkhighlands, and the Munro Society pages have more info. 

Red has been covered already, and it really is the most practical colour to have with you at night, as it is the only one that doesn't impact your night vision significantly. The others, though, are useful for all sorts of signaling or navigation purposes. It can be easier to signal a red or green rather than send Morse code for stop or go, for example. Or you could give navigation instructions to head for the red light then turn towards the blue light. 

The key differentiator between tarps and more modern tent material is the breathability and wicking you get from modern materials. Modern tents are very effective at passing moisture outside, but even then, you still see the recommendation that you don't let anything touch the inside of the tent during the night as moisture will take the easiest route. Older tents just couldn't breathe as well, and you do expel a lot of moisture in your breath (from 50mL/hour) so you needed a good pitch on the tent to allow this water to run down. With the older tents you would also keep your groundsheet within the perimeter of the tent, so this water could run all the way to the earth, and not pool on your groundsheet. 

I don't think OpenCaching is unpopular in Germany, just that GeoCaching.com seems to be the de facto portal in most regions. If you mean a tag or chip that you pop in an existing cache with the intent that it be moved by the next visitor to the cache, I can't see a problem with that - it's pretty common the world over. You just need to ensure that the mobile cache has brief instructions provided, for those who haven't seen one before. Ideally a URL and an ID number should be all that is required, but a brief comment to say what it is may be useful. 

Having been a keen surfer since the late eighties, I can give you a reasonable list of the essentials: 

I swear by Thule for transporting anything on the roof. Over the years I have had various vehicles, and various transport requirements, and this type of bar has: 

Guidance that came with my extreme sleeping bags was to randomly stuff, as @Russell commented, trying to use a different pattern each time, and to hang it over a line and give it a good beating when you return home. The small bags they came with seem fine - and they have lasted 10 years+ so far. 

I grew up in a fishing community on islands north of Scotland, and never once heard this. The folks up there used English and Norse greetings, but not a German one, so I would imagine it is German-specific. So Universal? No. 

The climbs here range from a 3 to an 8C+ but on a particular pitch you may have a few ranging from a 5 to a 6B, for example, so similar to what Benedikt mentioned, if I find I can't complete a particularly tricky move I'll grab a different colour to get past it, but try and make it next time without resorting to that. This lets you gain incremental progression. 

So for this year, your best bet if you go on the day is that you will be in the crowds on the shoreline, which sounds like you wouldn't enjoy it so much 

I am not sure about the being able to feel more, but the most important reason I don't use socks is to avoid the rock boot sliding on my foot. If you are on a marginal grip using just the edge of your sole, you don't want the boot to move at all. This is also one of the reasons that rock boots for more experienced climbers are much more rigid than those for beginners - so you know that when you touch the rock, the rubber will grip and not bend. 

Then you need to look at the reinforcement you will require at these points. Once that is complete, be aware that she will try to point a lot higher, as the shape of the hull is not optimised for 2 masts, so you are likely to use the tiller more, causing a fair amount of drag. Solutions to this can include moving the centreboard or adding extra keels. 

But that may be impractical for a light team already out in the field, so SAR teams recommend head torches like these. Only 170 lumens, but very portable: 

If you are running long distances over multiple days with boots, packs etc., and you must complete the distance you should plan to pop a blister at the end of day, but then you need to be sure you add some sort of padding to replace the protection the blister is giving you. You also need it cleaned and sealed, so antibacterial cleaner, then compeed, fakeskin or similar. For shorter distances, like the day hike you mention, just leave it - plan to wear more padding around it for a few days and it will go down nicely. One exception - if you get a big blister under a toenail, get rid of it as quickly as you can or you may end up with the nail bed permanently damaged. This happened to me after one marathon and I ended up needing a lot of surgery and cauterisation to remove a nail bed that had become canted up at a 30 degree angle. Not fun! 

It is astonishingly popular the world over, and isn't as easy as it sounds - not just because clues can be very cryptic, and caches can be hidden really well, but because GPS units aren't always that accurate. An alternative - which I really like - is the Degree Confluence Project 

A local source of water is obviously easiest - if you are near a stream - but if not, smothering can be really effective. In planning, having your fire made on stones above damp ground will help, as you can scatter the embers a little without risking the fire spreading, and scattered embers will die down faster than a hot core of a fire. Covering with damp soil can put out a fire quickly. Sometimes even really damp leaves or grass can be sufficient to put out a fire that is already dying down - but this will depend on your local environment. 

You can get a lot of the way towards understanding which ground has a good likelihood of being marshy from full use of Ordnance Survey (or equivalent) maps, and looking at the type of rock in the area you will be hiking. Good quality maps give a lot of detail around topography, so you can look at slopes and heights near watercourses etc. If you are on a flood plain you have a reasonably high likelihood of marsh, whereas a steep slope will not be. Being aware of the type of rock around you will help a lot - limestone country will probably not give you marshland, but poses a higher risk of sinkholes etc as it is very porous and easily eroded. Looking at the type of plants growing around you will help - bullrushes, reeds etc. are an indicator of waterlogged ground. Some maps even mark marshy ground - which helps:-)
