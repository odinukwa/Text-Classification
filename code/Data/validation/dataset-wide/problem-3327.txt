I tried to add it as a comment, but I couldn't so I post it here. I think there is a misunderstanding between free word order and scrambling languages. Free word order languages are those that do not have any order. It is a property of non-configurational languages. (Of course there is a big discussion whether these languages really non- configurational and whether they really do not have any order, but at least it looks like this). Warlperi is one of these languages. On other hand Turkish is not a free order language, its neutral order is SVO. It is a scrambling language. It may scramble objects and adjuncts to a higher position for topic, focus and etc. (there are some other scramblings as well) however, there are restriction on scrambling in Turkish. Not all possible word order combinations are grammatical in Turkish. That's why it is not free word order language, it is a scrambling language. 

All forms of the Latin verb "FACERE" that went to French had a "c", but it has disappeared in all forms of the French verb "faire". In FACIS > fais, the "c" completely disappeared. In FACIUNT > font, the "c" also disappeared. In FACIAM > fasse, the "c" became "ss". I have noticed that some of the instances of "c" in the Latin forms are followed by a yod. Perhaps this is the cause of the difference. However, the "c" in FACIUNT is also followed by a yod, and it also disappeared. I am seeking an explanation of the evolution of these forms, and I would also prefer to have a step by step evolution of those three selected forms above. 

Main problem In French, past participles that take avoir are not inflected to agree with the object in gender and number, except when the object is placed in front of the verb. Is this phenomenon found in other Romance languages? How did this phenomenon originate? How is the agreement of the participle in Old French? This page seems to have some clues. How is this phenomenon in Spanish and Italian? 

Ancient Greek does have οὐδενία "worthlessness" (in Plato) and οὐδενόσωρος "nobody's concern = worthless" (in Homer). 

The distribution is not quite the same—the oblique in Old French was mandatory after prepositions, rather than indicating motion as in more case-rich languages; but Waringhien drew parallels between the use of the Esperanto accusative in adjuncts rather than direct objects, and the Old French oblique. In any case, the Old French oblique is a merger of all non-nominative Latin cases; so that kind of thing can indeed happen. 

The earliest such proposal was Ioannis Vilaras' in 1814, proposing eta (not iota) for all /i/ sounds, and omicron for /o/: $URL$ The most successful such proposal was in the Soviet Union in the 30s, when all Greek (including Demotic, Pontic, and Mariupolitan) was written phonetically in the Greek alphabet (with upsilon for /u/ and universal final sigma)—the latter two variants with new digraphs like ςς for /ʃ/. Those digraphs have been revived in the Pontic Wikipedia's orthography. The digraphs for voiced/(optionally) prenasalised stops are arguably awkward, and transcription of dialect can dodge them; I'm not aware of orthographic reform proposals taking issue with them, though. 

If you arecomming from the non-linguistics environment, the best book is to start with Is Fromkin, Introduction to language. It provides a general introduction to syntax, morphology, phonology, semantics, pragmatics and brain and language. It is easy to read. I really advise you to start with it. For syntax, you can read Andrew Carney's Syntax: a generative introduction. Hageman's introduction to government and binding. Redford's Minimalist syntax. I have benefited from these books a lot and i advice you to read them in this order. For phonology, you should read Oddey's Introducing phonology. Good luck 

There are two kinds of NPs existential and definite. Sometimes NP that we would expect to be existential behave as they are actually definite. One example of such NPs are those that are kind-denoting. ex: The snake is a cold blood animal. The rose is a flower. These sentences have general meaning and we would expect them to have existential meaning and take indefinite article. However, they take definite article and have definite meaning. Could any one give examples of relative clauses that have kind-denoting meaning and are definite or is there any articles on this topic? Thank you. 

Conclusion The fact that we can have a column "common" is what makes those language M-T paradigmatic instead of M-T non-paradigmatic. 

For those with avoir, the past participle does not agree in gender or number with the subject. For example: 

sigillum > sceau ? This is a strange case. The "eau" can only be explained by that the /i/ has shifted to /ɛ/ in VL. This word is even stranger. In almost all descendants that kept the "g", the first vowel is "u" instead of "i" (e.g. Italian "suggello"), for which I have two explanations: 

Splitters There are actually splitters. In the Cantonese language (my native language), there was a historical splitter around a century ago, in which the high flat tone was split into two tones (53 and 55), with unpredictable rules. This caused some homophones to lose their status as homophones and helped to distinguish the meanings. The splitter has re-merged in Hong Kong Cantonese (my dialect) so I do not even know which words were pronounced 53 and which words 55. Adding extra information So how do languages deal with the increase in number of homophones? In Chinese, many thousand years ago, most morphemes consisted of a single syllable. However, as the language evolves, homophones arise, and the Chinese formed compound words from the monosyllabic words, solving the problem of homophones. In Spanish, which evolved from Latin, the word for "heart" is "corazón" while that of Latin is "cor". Such a simple word is lengthened in Proto-Romance already, by adding "-tione". cor -> *coratione -> corazón 

Try to use idioms. If we assume that idioms start as a one constituents, they may show underlined wordorder. you can also look at more unmarked word order. 

Kazakh was written in Perso-Arabic before it wasincluded into USSR. All countries in USSR used cyrilic alphabet, thus, Kazakh languages at that period was written in Cyrilic. After gaining independence, Kazak government decided to convert their writing into Latin. Now, it is in the period of transition to Latin. 

According to formal sementics propositions (semantic term for "sentences", "clauses") have truth value. The truth value shows whether sentence is true or false and it is denoted as 1 or 0. What about sentences that have failed in presupposition? Do they have truth value? Ex: The king of USA lives in NY. Here, the interlocutor presupposes that the USA is ruled by the king, and s/he fails in his/her presupposition. So what be the truth value of this proposition? I think that it is impossible for proposition that has failed in presupposition to have a truth value but I am not sure. Note: here I am talking about the direct meaning of the word "king", not possible metaphoric. 

I am seeking an explanation for the development of the forms of Spanish "seguir" from Latin "SEQVI" (Vulgar Latin: *sequire), especially the irregular forms. Especially, why did the "e" become "i" in the first syllable in some forms? I have read that it is because of the yod that follows it, causing the vowel "e" to be raised to "i". For example, in *sequivit > siguió (pretérito tercera persona/preterite third-person): 

When Latin evolved to French, the vowel /u/ fronted to become /y/... except in Latin "VRSVS" /ur.sus/ > French "ours" /uʁs/, in which the vowel /u/ was kept. I do not think that the /rs/ environment kept the /u/, because we can see Latin "DVRVS" /du.rus/ > Old French "durs" /dyrs/, where the "u" is changed anyway. Usually, front vowels tend to be unrounded and back vowels tend to be rounded, but this sound change seems to have violated this rule. 

Pontic Greek, historically spoken in Northern Turkey, has acquired an animacy distinction on top of its inherited gender system; see e.g. $URL$ : 

It's a value judgement, clearly. To be litos is to be plain as a positive value judgement; cf. English "plain-spoken". Plainness of speech was extended to avoiding superlatives in speech, as excessively emotive: Ancient Greek culture valued "moderation", which includes understatement. Saying something is "not uncommon" or "not ungraceful" increases processing time, but the praiseworthy plainness from an Ancient Greek perspective is not about processing simplicity (and reading isn't really the point here—these were conventions of oratory). The praiseworthy plainness is about making a show of being reluctant to go overboard in one's positive descriptions. That's speculation based on what I know of Greek and Ancient Greeks. While $URL$ reports that the rhetorical figure is already in place in Homer, LSJ reports that the earliest use of litotes to describe it is in late Roman grammarians: $URL$ commentary on Virgil, $URL$ commentary on Terence (4th to 5th centuries AD.) 

However, some of the forms did not have the yod, e.g. VL. *sequis > Sp. sigues. What is it that caused the raising of those forms? 

One would think that as long as one of the two vowels are closed, then a diphthong could be formed. However, if a diphthong consists of two closed vowels with the same roundness, like the following 8 diphthongs, then they rarely occur: 

Background (skip if you know French) In French, to generate the past tense, you use the past participle of the verb, attaching in front a conjugated form of avoir or être. For example: 

नर (nara) This is from Proto-Indo-European *h₂nḗr. Cognates include Ancient Greek ἀνήρ, genitive ᾰ̓νδρός, whence English andro-. नरक (naraka) According to hi.wiktionary: 

This seems to suggest that at one time [h] was pronounced, for example, in haïr. This also explains why liaison was not done on these words, because /ʒə.he/ would not contract to */ʒe/. Later the [h] became silent, but the non-contracted form passed on.
