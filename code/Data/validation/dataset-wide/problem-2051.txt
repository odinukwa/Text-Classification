One way to look at these conflicts is to pretend (takes time and effort) that they are merely technical problems rather than the personal, ego-based issues that they are. Assuming you have the time or can take some out, call get everyone's inputs, and tell them you will take a decision based on the respective merits of the library. Option A: If having two libraries is not a maintenance issue (the code does not give you too much trouble) simply let both lie and tell both people concerned there are many more important things to do - discuss pending Quadrant II deadlines here. Get them involved in those. Option B: Let both people that you are looking at cross-domain skills, and you will decide on a library - but the person who has earlier worked on the library will not be the one doing the implementation, the other person will. This is slightly nasty, but should tempers cooled down pretty fast. For the long run, create the impression that you do not want to discuss specifics, are not interested in personal arguments - but do want to help the person grow as a whole. They will eventually stop complaining. In general, never literally get into a fight between two subordinates and take sides - as in when it is actually happening. 

The short answer is: in many cases, yes (but). Junior roles are just that: positions of a low rank in the corporate org structure, often filled by people with little-to-no professional experience. In situations where opinions differ (and sometimes other situations as well), your input will likely carry less weight for these reasons. That said, a good senior employee or team lead will still take input from all sources, whether to provide feedback and coaching to junior employees, or simply for the practical reason that good ideas can come from anyone. Your situation sounds more complicated It's tough to get into too great of detail based solely on the information you've provided, but just from that it seems there are several layers to parse here. 1, Ageism is a real thing. In tech, this often cuts the other way—discrimination against older people in tech is very common; it is commonly seen as "a young person's game." On the other hand, being young can definitely cause others to ascribe less weight to your input, especially if you are noticeably younger than your immediate peers/the median age of the company. 2. Being present is important. The fact that you are part-time is definitely a factor here. Many things become orders of magnitude more complicated or difficult when you and your colleagues are not co-located. Not being around will dilute your impact. Period. This is true for people working remotely, but may be especially true in your case; your full-time colleagues may not take you as seriously because you literally aren't putting in the same work that they are. (Not that your work is less valuable or of a different quality, but by sheer quantity, you are by definition doing less) 3. You're new. If most of the other employees have been there for years (5 years is a long time!) they likely have pre-existing relationships with each other and/or processes at the company. Having only been there a few months is not going to seem like much compared to that history, 4. Your autism may be complicating things. You mentioned autism in your question. I don't know the details of your personal situation—that label covers a lot of territory—and I don't want to make assumptions. However, broadly speaking, social cues and interpersonal communication can often be more difficult for people with autism, and while I don't want to necessarily ascribe your difficulties to that, it may well be a complicating factor on everything else. 5. Your hiring manager isn't your manager. You were expecting the person who interviewed you to be your boss, and they're not. Let this be a learning moment for you: when interviewing, ask who you will be reporting to. It sounds like you had a good rapport with this person, but not so much with your current manager. What you can do about it Don't just give up. You can still make this situation work for you. Communication is king Talk to your current manager. Try to avoid being confrontational about it, but share how you've been feeling ignored. Ask about the recent move to adopt that framework based on the consultant's input, and what was different about the current situation than when you suggested it earlier. There may be broader context or other aspects to the situation that you are not privy to because of your junior role. Again, I suggest being cautious about tone in this kind of discussion. It may help (especially if you do have difficulties with communication) to write down what you want to say in advance. I recommend having a friend read it over as well; an impartial third party will be able to tell you how things may be recieved. Find mentorship Consider talking to the person who interviewed you. Even in an informal context, getting advice from this person will probably be helpful. They may have advice about how to deal with the specific personalities and/or priorities on your team. Be a little careful with this one—you don't want to seem to be going over your current manager's head. Depending on the culture of your workplace, there could be political ramifications to consider. Adjust your expectations You are a young part-time employee in a junior role. Your teammates should listen to you because you are a part of the team, but that doesn't mean that they'll listen to or accept everything you say. Nor should they. Do keep trying to be helpful and pro-active. Even if your main job duties are to write code, if you have input on or insight into architecture, frameworks, tools, workflows or the like, then share them! Helping the company succeed is also part of your job. But maybe temper your expectations a little. It's ok to give input. It's not ok to expect that input to be taken every time (or even ever!) especially given the stage of your career. If it's really not working out, it's ok to quit You're young and you're a student. Give it your best, but remember that your career is only beginning. You don't have to be tied to this job. You've experienced for yourself a different workplace that felt better (your internship) so you know that this isn't "just how it is everywhere." Do what's right for you. 

Should be: "People have told me that I can communicate what I want to say, but it is not simple and clear" 

You might be constructing sentences in your head in your native language (I would guess Chinese?) and then translating that into English. Because sentences are formed differently in English than in Chinese, for example, it is difficult for others to follow. It is only difficult because you are communicating in a way different from what they are used to. The remedy for this is to expose yourself to regular, common use of the English language. Read. Read for long periods, (1-2 hours a day). You can read fiction or non-fiction (Harry Potter, Malcolm Gladwell books, it doesn't matter, as long as they're clearly written works*). By reading, you will learn absorb what good writing is, by observing it and seeing it in practice. Also, try watching English TV shows, and pay attention to how you talk, and how it differs from how people use language on TV. *e.g. Don't go and read Shakespeare! 

It does. Your job could get outsourced to a vendor. Your performance might not reach the right ears. Whatever. Also, while you should talk to your reporting manager about these issues, keep in mind that his primary role now will be to "hold the ship" together. So if he gives you a negative answer, you need to start looking out for another job immediately. Even if he gives a positive answer, you should check out market value, understand what roles are available, what are your best career prospects, etc. In conclusion, an acquistion is something where you always need to be careful, especially if you are in the company that has been acquired. 

Legal Angle - I personally would not go down this road. Reason is two-fold - doing so might not be legal (you would need to check separately for that). Worse, it would spoil relations with the team. Unless, you are in a rule-based union shop, I don't think spoiling relations is a good idea. Personal Angle - I have been in a few situations like the one described above. (I can speak three languages, and understand a fourth, though not converse too well in it.) In one situation, I was with some people whose first language was my fourth. In the other, I was with some people who spoke my first language. In all these situations, my experience is that is there is no language like your first language for comfort (for the sake of reference - English is not my first language though I am quite fluent in it). 

Here's my opinion. You should not miss the opportunity to have great in-game art. You should try to harness this person's capabilities as best you can. At the same time, what Sean is saying, is toxicity is unacceptable and can kill your team. If he demotivates the other artists and prevents the game from getting finished, that's not too good. So there are a few ways you can handle this. 1) One is, make him aware that his comments are hurtful. Explain to him that he needs to be tactful in commenting on other people's work. You'll never reach your goal if your team is continually sabotaging itself. 2) If you can modularize the work, and act as the middle man, then you can kind of reduce reason for Mr. Direct to put other people down. 

(Being now several years into my career, prospective employers are much more interested in my work experience and pretty much don't care about my degree aside from the fact that I have one, so this question is mostly hypothetical. I was discussing college with a friend recently and ended up wondering about this) 

Have the skip-level meeting first If you have a good rapport with your manager's manager, and expect that they would sign off on this internal mobility request, speak with them first. They may have insight into whether your manager would be likely to approve this, and good advice on how to approach the subject with your manager. To be clear, you should wait on having them actually sign anything until your direct manager either signs off or refuses to do so. That said, be careful with this option. Based on your description of your manager, this could be exactly the sort of thing he sees as "over-stepping" him. You know your office politics best, so use your judgement here. 

Without sounding too harsh, your use of language is awkward. I can deconstruct your writing style sentence by sentence. 

If they involve you in the pranks, just tell them you don't like pranks and they annoy you. If they don't stop annoying you, complain. There is no way to have a bunch of pranksters both consider you in the group while you do not participate in the activities of their social group. Deciding to be an "outlier" is something done by how you act. So you can't have it both ways. I completely understand your desire not to be annoyed! Don't be in such need of acceptance that you're willing to endure pain or bullying for it. If they act inappropriately, take the necessary steps to shut it down. 

The problem here I think is with the word "office". Try to change this to something else. You could try Manager, Growth or something else. I think going into jobs, a title that talks Business Development is more likely to be appreciated than others. 

As a supervisor, your niece can always pull rank, and ask them to talk in English. What impact this has depends on: A. What relationship she has with them. B. Are they doing any cribbing compared to just talking about stuff. Your niece could also look at it as a challenge, and learn the language. Apart from making the team feel nice, it also creates a situation where the fact that your niece cannot speak the language is clearly emphasised to the people speaking it. 

Just ask to meet/see the team you'll be working with. The entire team. Say you're interviewing with 3 people and the time for "questions" comes. At that time say "I'd like to meet the team." What will probably happen is they'll take you over to the area where your to-be-teammates are. If you don't see any other women on the team, then simply don't join. You, as the job hunter, are responsible for investigating the environment you are placing yourself in. Sometimes, it is better to ask a question, or request to see something, which will indirectly get the response to a question in your mind, without asking that question explicitly, or having the recruiters ever even know that (working with a woman) was a concern of yours.
