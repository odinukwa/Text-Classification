For each positive integer $i$, let $A_i$ be a fixed representation of the symmetric group $S_i$. I won't tell you exactly what $A_i$ is, but let's say that I have a very explicit description of its character. Let $\lambda$ be a partition of a fixed integer $n$, and let $\ell$ be its length. Let $W_\lambda \subset S_n$ be the stabilizer of $\lambda$. This group $W_\lambda$ is a semidirect product of the Young subgroup $S_\lambda = S_{\lambda_1}\times\ldots\times S_{\lambda_\ell}$ and a subgroup $T_\lambda \subset S_\ell$, which shuffles pieces of $\lambda$ of the same size. How can one compute the character of $\operatorname{Ind}_{W_\lambda}^{S_n}(A_{\lambda_1}\otimes\ldots \otimes A_{\lambda_\ell})$? Here $S_{\lambda_i}\subset S_\lambda$ acts on the $i^\text{th}$ factor of the tensor product, and $T_\lambda$ acts by permuting the factors of the tensor product. In theory, I know that I have all of the necessary information to compute this character, but I wonder if there are any useful combinatorial tricks to organize the data. Regarding the motivation for this question, I would like to apply the recursive formula in Remark 3.6 of this paper $URL$ when $W=S_n$ and $\mathcal{A}$ is the braid arrangement. 

From the introductory part of Chapter 2 of Grisvard's book, we know that the PDE system \begin{align} -\Delta u &= 0 &\text{in}\ \Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2\\ u &= g &\text{on}\ \Gamma\\ \end{align} where $g\in H^{1/2}(\Gamma)$, has a unique weak solution $u \in H^1(\Omega)$ which is also $H^2$ regular when $\Omega$ (open and bounded) has $C^{1,1}$ boundary $\Gamma = \partial \Omega$. Question Is the solution $u \in H^1(\Omega)$ still $H^2$ regular if $\Gamma$ is only a subset of $\partial\Omega$? Added Question Let $\Gamma_1 \subset \partial \Omega$ and define $\Gamma_2:=\partial \Omega \setminus \bar{\Gamma}_1$. Suppose I define the map $H^{1/2}(\Gamma_1) \ni g \mapsto f:=u|_{\Gamma_2}$ where $u$ is the solution of the PDE system $\Delta u = 0$ in $\Omega$ and $u = g$ on $\Gamma_1$. Does the solution of the new PDE system \begin{align} -\Delta v &= 0 &\text{in}\ \Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2\\ v &= g &\text{on}\ \Gamma_1\\ v &= f &\text{on}\ \Gamma_2 \end{align} have an $H^2$ regularity? I believe that, in this case, I now have an $H^2$ regular solution. 

The polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ decomposes as a direct sum of isotypic components for the action of the symmetric group $S_n$. The isotypic component of the trivial representation is simply the ring of symmetric functions. The complementary summand--that is, the direct sum of all the other isotypic components--is a free module of rank $n!-1$ over the ring of symmetric functions. I would like to have an explicit basis, or at least an explicit set of generators, for this module. For example, if $n=2$, we have $\mathbb{C}[x_1,x_2] = \mathbb{C}[x_1,x_2]^{S_2} \oplus \mathbb{C}[x_1,x_2]^{S_2}\cdot (x_1-x_2)$, so we have a basis consisting of the single element $x_1-x_2$. More generally, the isotypic component of the sign representation is equal to symmetric functions times the Vandermonde determinant, so the Vandermonde determinant should probably be one of the elements of my generating set. 

Let $f:Y\to X$ be a proper birational map of normal varieties over an algebraically closed field which is an isomorphism over the regular locus. Q1: Is it the case that the pullback $f^*\operatorname{Pic}(X)\to\operatorname{Pic}(Y)$ is always injective? (Update: this was answered in the affirmative by Jason Starr.) Q2: Suppose that there exists a finite set $\{C_i \mid i\in I\}$ of projective curves in $Y$ such that a line bundle is ample (respectively nef) on $Y$ if and only if its restriction to each $C_i$ has positive (respectively non-negative) degree. Is it the case that a line bundle on $X$ (interpreted via pullback as a line bundle on $Y$) is ample (respectively nef) if and only if its restriction to each $C_i$ that isn't contracted by $f$ has positive (respectively non-negative) degree? For example, suppose that $Y$ is a crepant resolution of a Kleinian singularity, with exceptional divisor $E\subset Y$ consisting of a finite union of projective lines. Suppose that $X$ is a partial resolution, obtained from $Y$ by contracting some (but not all) of the components of $E$. Then the Picard group of $X$ should be isomorphic to the subgroup of the Picard group of $Y$ consisting of line bundles whose restrictions to the contracted curves have degree zero, and its ample cone should be those line bundles whose restrictions to the un-contracted curves have positive degree. 

From [Grisvard, Thm. 2.4.2.7, p. 126], the BVP \begin{align} -\Delta u &= 0 & \text{in}\ \Omega\\ -\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} + au &= g & \text{on}\ \Gamma\\ \end{align} where $a>0$ and $g \in H^{1/2}(\Gamma)$ has unique solution $u$ with $H^2$ regularity for open bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with boundary $\Gamma$ of class $C^{1,1}$. Question For $C^{2,1}$ boundary $\Gamma$ and $g \in H^{3/2}(\Gamma)$, is it true that $u \in H^3(\Omega)$? and, in general, is it true that $u \in H^{k+2}(\Omega)$ for $C^{k+1,1}$ boundary $\Gamma$ and $g \in H^{k+1/2}(\Gamma)$. 

From [Grisvard, Thm. 2.4.2.7, p. 126], the BVP \begin{align} -\Delta u &= 0 & \text{in}\ \Omega\\ -\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} + au &= g & \text{on}\ \Gamma\\ \end{align} where $a>0$ and $g \in H^{1/2}(\Gamma)$ has unique solution $u$ with $H^2$ regularity for open bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with boundary $\Gamma$ of class $C^{1,1}$. Question Let $a_1, a_2 >0$, $g_1 \in H^{1/2}(\Gamma_1)$ and $g_2\in H^{1/2}(\Gamma_2)$ where $\Gamma_1 \subset \Gamma$ and $\Gamma_2 = \Gamma\setminus \bar{\Gamma}_1$. Does the unique solution $u \in H^1(\Omega)$ of the BVP \begin{align} -\Delta u &= 0 & \text{in}\ \Omega\\ -\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} + a_1u &= g_1 & \text{on}\ \Gamma_1\\ -\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} + a_2u &= g_2 & \text{on}\ \Gamma_2 \end{align} have higher regularity (in particular, is $u\in H^2(\Omega)$) for domain $\Omega$ of class $C^{1,1}$? I know $u \in H^2(\Omega)$ if $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ are both closed, i.e., $\Omega$ is an annular domain. But, I do not know if I still have an $H^2$ regularity for the case given above. 

I'm looking for nice explanations of these two facts. EDIT: by the topology inherited from projective space I do not mean the Zariski topology, but the classical topology (given by balls in the Euclidean metric on the affine space from which we construct projective space, say). Since I have no intuition for the Zariski topology in this embedding, I'm not even sure I've got the statement correct: one place where it occurs is on page 147 in Fulton's Young tableaux book. EDIT 2: I have gotten it wrong; Fulton claims only that the Zariski closures of the open cells equal their classical closures. But he also calls it a general fact. I guess the proper version of my first question should be: why are the Zariski closures of the open schubert cells equal to their classical closures in the Pluecker embedding, and is there a general fact from which this follows? 

Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be an open bounded Lipschitz domain of class $C^{1,1}$ with boundary $\partial \Omega = \Gamma_i \cup \Gamma_o$, $\Gamma_i \cap \Gamma_o = \emptyset$ and dist$(\Gamma_i,\Gamma_o)>0$. Consider the PDE system \begin{align} -\Delta u &= 0 & \mbox{in}\ \Omega\\ u &= 1 & \mbox{on}\ \Gamma_o\\ -\partial_n u &= u+1 & \mbox{on} \ \Gamma_i. \end{align} I know that this BVP has a unique weak solution $u\in H^1(\Omega)$, and using the results in [Grisvard, Elliptic Problems in 9 Nonsmooth Domains, Chapter 2], I was able to show that $u$ has $H^2$ regularity. Now, what if instead of just a Dirichlet condition on $\Gamma_o$, I have the following boundary conditions \begin{align} u &=1 &\mbox{on}\ \Gamma_{o1}\\ -\partial_n u &= au+b&\mbox{on}\ \Gamma_{o2} \end{align} where $a,b>0$ and $\Gamma_{o1}=\Gamma_o\setminus \overline{\Gamma}_{o2}$. Edit So I have the new problem \begin{align} -\Delta u &= 0 & \mbox{in}\ \Omega\\ u &=1 &\mbox{on}\ \Gamma_{o1}\\ -\partial_n u &= au+b&\mbox{on}\ \Gamma_{o2}\\ -\partial_n u &= u+1 & \mbox{on} \ \Gamma_i. \end{align} Question Do I still have $H^2$ regularity for the weak solution $u$? If yes, how do I show this? I know how to approach the problem when both $\Gamma_{o1}$ and $\Gamma_{o2}$ are only imposed with a pure Dirichlet (or Neumann) boundary condition (e.g., $u=1$ on $\Gamma_{o1}$ and $u=a$ on $\Gamma_{o2}$). However, I do not know how to proceed when I have the new BVP above. Can someone please give me hint on how to deal with the problem and references that tackle such kind of problems? 

One good way to understand Arrow's paradox (not sure if the 'everyday life' condition applies here!) is via homology. See for example Baryshnikov: Unifying Impossibility Theorems: A Topological Approach. Basically, voter's preferences, as well as the aggregate preference, are represented as points in a topological space. The choice rule is a map between these spaces. The conditions of Arrow's theorem force the induced map on homology to be that of a dictator. 

By the hypercube I mean the lattice formed by all n-bit strings ordered by pointwise inequality. For example, $000 \leq 110$, $010 \leq 110$, $110$ and $001$ are not comparable. Further we have the meet and join operations $\wedge$ and $\vee$ that take the pointwise max and min. For example $010 \wedge 110 = 010$ and $001 \vee 100 = 101$. A submodular measure $\mu$ is a function from the hypercube to nonnegative reals satisfying $\mu(x) + \mu(y) \geq \mu(x \wedge y) + \mu(x \vee y)$ for all $x$ and $y$. My question is, what is a minimal set of $(x,y)$ such that if the inequality above holds for these $(x,y)$ then it holds for all $(x,y)$ (and hence $\mu$ is submodular)? The question comes out of mere curiousity (I want to understand submodularity in a more intuitive way) - I first guessed it suffices to check all pairs of elements of same rank. I'm still not sure whether that's true. If $x$ and $y$ are comparable, then the inequality is vacuous by itself.
