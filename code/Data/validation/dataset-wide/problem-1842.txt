it is not possible to use variables as Keltia already said, but perhaps mod_vhost_alias can help you with your problem. 

make sure your jar is using the packed libs on your ubuntu box. Just move the libs in the filesystem temporarily to another location. When your jar runs, you can be sure the libs in the jar are used. How did you reference the external libs from your jar? Did you add them to the Class-Path of your manifest file? When you did so, did you use relative or absolute paths? 

try solr, it also has a date filter when you configure it. here is a php client to solr and here is a tutorial from developer works for setting this up. when it does not fullfill all your needs, you can also extend it. 

try to replace with . this way your mail command will only be executed one time for all logs defined in a block. this is the text from the man page: 

the should definitely be in your section of your ssl part to be only applied when your ssl host is accessed. url.rewirte-once can be placed without conditional but it seems that it will not work all the time according to some forums. 

check your routes. perhaps you have different routes for different ips or not the correct netmask. another way to test your connection is to ping with a specified source interface. 

the best solution depends much on your setup, so there is no general answer. but the docs should help you to decide what solution to take. one more point to consider: a waf is adding some more complexity to your system, so be sure whether you want to use it or not. 

so change the value to a value matching your environment. but be sure to synchronize the value with the value or equivalent as explained in this documentation 

the communication with ssh protocol is secure, but i think your admins have other reasons for not granting ssh access with the first request. when you gain ssh access to a system, you can normally copy files to the system and execute them (not only your jars). this way, you could upload files gaining root access or compromise the system in a different way. so when granting ssh access, no matter how secure it is setup, you have direct access to the machine and this is another attack vector to the system. the philosophy should be to enable as few services as possible. but i can't imagine your admins are not already using ssh. so there should be no additional risk on enabling ssh, but perhaps on giving away a new account on the server. ask them whether they use public key authentication or password authentication. it is a good security advice to use public keys. another reason for not granting you access, could be that they loose a bit of control over the server, because they do not know in detail what is running on the server. so tell them in detail what you want to upload and what these programs do. they might ask you some more questions or tell you you have to change something, but this way you can work together with your admins to get your jars running on the server. as a windows client, i agree with Chris Kaufmann, putty is a very good client on windows. 

i agree with you, that worms or other malware nowadays are smart enough to get the right proxy settings to connect to the internet. but anyway it could be a good idea to use a proxy when you deny all other internet connections. this way you have a central access point to the internet which could be combined with anti virus software, intrusion detection or other security software. all of them seem to be for incoming traffic but can also be used for outgoing traffic. this would give you two points to fight the malware, first incoming traffic (prevent worms from being installed) and outgoing traffic (prevent worms from spreading). you should also improve security on the laptops, to prevent that the laptops get infected on other networks. there are different opportunities for your users: 

It seems, there is also a way to install SQL*Loader with instant clients: $URL$ I'm quite sure it is not supported by Oracle and you need a client installation like DCookie explained. But it could be a solution when you need to install it on multiple servers. The alternative solution would be to make a installation like DCookie explained and create a rpm/deb from it and push it to multiple servers. 

Instead of doing it manually, like suggested in the other answers, you could also change the init script. Just add such a line to the header: 

Have you asked your provider which ports are allowed? Perhaps the provider has a central firewall which only allows some port like http or ftp for the vps. 

your files no longer belong to your account, because you copied them as root. this way root became the owner. to get back to sudo, mount your root partition from a rescue environment and edit . add your user account to the admin group and you should have sudo access again. after that you can change ownership of the copied files. do you have another ubuntu installation where to look for the correct ownership? 

you should definitely exclude the zip file from gzip compression. There is no need in compressing already compressed content again. This is not only valid for zip files but also for jpg and so on. 

To access your balancer-manager, create an extra management vhost with in it. This way, you have one place where all your balancers are defined and one vhost to access the balancer-manager which shows you all your balncers. 

i don't think this is possible. when you connect via ssh to your machine and then wipe out everything, your ssh server is gone and with him your connection. when your server has no cd/dvd drive and does not boot from usb/network, how did you install your server the first time? one possibility are remote management cards (e.g. rsa, ilo, ...). with them you can attach iso images or local cd/dvd/usb drives to the server and install from these devices. 

we had the same problem: to much information for one image. what helped a lot are layers. you can put the items on different layers. we than added some buttons with vba scripts to make layers visible or hide them. this way you can put all information in one place but only show the information you currently need. 

check the files and and whether the client is entered correctly. when this does not help, please post your export file. 

RunDeck could also be descriped as the lightweight ControlTier. These tools not only give you a cluster shell, but also a web frontend and you can save your jobs for future use. 

oracle's bug database is only telling something about 64bit and 1.5 version systems: $URL$ but perhaps you have found the bug in another version? have you tried this parameter to reduce the size of the code cache? the bug database is mentioning some more parameters, perhaps you try them and test whether the error still occurs. 

How about changing your script, just returning a part of the rows (e.g. 1st 100 rows) and then giving the possibility to fetch the next ones. Not every problem can be fixed with some configuration parameters. 

just change your mod_jk configuration and remove one tomcat from the cluster. after doing a graceful restart of your apache, every request goes to the desired tomcat. when you are finished with testing you just put the second tomcat back in configuration and do again a graceful restart of your apache. you could also change of the tomcat which you want to disable and do the same graceful restart. 

you could setup a local yum repository on one server and update your server with that. here is a doc which also describes how to include updates. a more sophisticated way would be using spacewalk. it is the open source software on which red hat builds its satellite server. 

this means, that apache will be started with SSL support. this defines the variable SSL and in your config shoud be a line like this somewhere: 

to get the broadcast correct, guessing is your correct broadcast address. but be aware that the ip address will vanish with the next reboot. you have to specify it in an interface file to make it permanent. in suse it is e.g. . there are normally also some gui tools to do the network configuration, in suse it is , in redhat it is . 

this could help you, when you want to create the flowcharts online and share them. this tools lets you create something similar to flowcharts, but you can easily add references to additional resources. might be helpful to reference to other docs, scripts or ... so the conceptmaps could be used as a starting point. for advanced users it will give a rough way (the details could be solved individually) and for not so experienced users it could reference to additional info how to do things.
