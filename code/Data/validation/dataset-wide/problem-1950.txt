Not necessarily. The key question is how does one use this as part of their background. If one is going for entry-level software development jobs, then the Ph.D. may be a hurdle to work around as the position could be seen as being too low to do by HR and others. Thus, one has to recognize that some jobs may be removed from consideration by having the credential and a perceived expectation of wanting to be paid more. 

Couldn't you specify that you want a company with a more mature development methodology and that you're curious to see how mature is the development process at this company? That does answer the question in the sense of stating what technical components you want to know and if the person is technical they may answer that they use "Agile" and have done so for X years that you could follow-up afterward if you want something more specific. The key is to acknowledge that your current employer isn't a great fit because you'd prefer a more mature process with better structure and want to find that in another place. The key is to ask the company, "What do you use for unit tests?" or "How do you apply the SOLID principles here?" for the technical staff if that is a litmus test for you. The key is to be able to state what the bar is for where you want to be and note that your current employer doesn't meet this requirement despite various efforts that haven't worked and thus you want to work in a different environment that you believe better suits your talents and preferences. 

No, I'd see this the other way around. If they want to get paid for placing you then they better do it quickly. I'd see this more as something to move quickly to place someone that may be in a hot field rather than as something less likely to get done. 

In terms of ability, I'm pretty sure you have the ability to make a comment about something mundane. However, you do have to be aware that in breaking the ice you may also be shooting off your foot. For example, some people may remark about how they strongly dislike coffee from Starbucks and thus make a remark like, "I hope the coffee here is better than the junk they serve down the street," which may or may not be well received. If the other person in the interview is a diehard fan of Starbucks then you may have a big mess to clean up as what to you was mundane isn't mundane to him or her. Humor in an interview can be good but also difficult to successfully do. Nailing the timing and delivery is a key point. Just be prepared to defend why you're saying what you say. Chances are either the other person can accept that part of you or not. 

I'd be careful of taking salary at the top of the range for a couple of reasons: 1) Justification. Are you sure that you are going to be the rock star in that position that justifies being paid the maximum in that range? There is the potential for them to ask why you think you are worth that much to which you should have an answer. 2) Future growth. By taking the top value right off the bat, in future years at that organization, you may be limited in terms of raises by starting out at the top for the position you'd have. While I will acknowledge that if you do plan on moving into a different role a year or two later this is somewhat moot, there is the potential to understand that by going for the top right off the bat, you may get limited raises for a couple of years or more. 

Be honest with whatever answer you give and focus more on the prospective employer thinking, "What do I have to do to get you to come here?" as that could be another way to read into this question of, "Why do you want to leave where you are now?" which I have heard in a few variations over the years in interviews as some companies may want to know what motivates you, what are the key features to point out in the role if they do want you, and what possible issues could there be here. Something to consider if you haven't already done so is to consider what are the qualities of your dream job and be able to articulate what these are so that a prospective employer could look at this and think, "Hhmm, can we deliver that?" as what you'd probably want to articulate is that you are being selective in where you'll go next. Analyzing the fit is an important point here and may be something to point out though be careful of how you paint your current employer as this can be seen as a way to get taken out of the running if you rant about where you are now like those answers near the end of Kate's answer. 

First of all, when someone does come up with a question, concern or complaint, what kind of initial reaction do they get from you? They may be overly dramatic so that they get your attention and you get how important they view this issue to be. Consider the employee that has just one project that from the management perspective is a tiny project and thus isn't at all important, yet for that employee it is all they have in that company is that one project! Perspective of each person and acknowledgement is worth noting. Secondly, how well are you giving feedback to your team of how well they are doing? Do they know how good or bad they are doing at their job? I've had more than a few times where I'd be overly dramatic so I could get some of my manager's time. The pointing out that they see things for me would be a yellow flag about how well your company handles recognition and this isn't about financial rewards but rather other kinds that can be much more meaningful. I'd advise having 1 on 1 discussions with each person on the team about how you'd like issues to be brought to you along with how fast they can expect a response from you. Some issues if you sit on them for a few days will cause more problems as there is something to be said for addressing issues promptly and ensuring that you acknowledge that you hear the employee with the issue. While it may be already be solved, isn't it better for the employee to think, "Ok, they heard me and things will get better..." than "Dang, they don't listen to me! Why do I even bother working hard here?" as if you end up with disengaged employees you could have bigger problems to handle in the future. 

First, make sure you have your own review of the work you've done and examples to back up whatever points you want to make about your work. For example, how did you handle conflict in the workplace? How did you handle work-life balance? How did you manage whatever quality of work you did do? Be prepared with examples of whatever you think you may claim in terms of, "I've done good work," that the boss may ask, "Where was that?" Second, be prepared to both give and receive feedback on your work. You may be asked, "What was the hardest part of the job?" or "What advice would you have for someone that was taking an internship here?" that are rather standard questions that may come. At the same time, you may be asked, "What was the best part of working with me?" or "What was the hardest part of working with me?" from the boss that may be part of his review. In terms of mindsets, be prepared for both asking and answering questions. There may be more than a few moments where you didn't know the whole story on something that may be explained in the review. There is also the chance that it is mostly paperwork that has to do be done and thus isn't likely to get the attention that it may get in some organizations. If you state something like, "I do not think this job is a good fit for me," that may well merit a "Why?" reply that you then have to articulate why it isn't a good fit. Is there another department that may be a better fit? Is there a different kind of work within the department that may work better? If you say, "No," too much you may appear fussy which I doubt is the intention you want to be giving here. 

"The floor" that is likely "the lowest floor" as otherwise we could just use the highest floor and be done with the problem. What kind of proof is wanted to know that a bulb would break if dropped from floor X? If there are trials to do then there are at most 2 drops that could be done unless there are others available. Is the drop just a simple release or could one throw the bulb down into the ground? There are various factors here that could be worth noting. Should we have "Warning: Bulbs being dropped" signs out front when we do test the drops? 

If someone has a disability there may be various non-profit institutions that could help job-seekers find a job. There are a couple of organizations I know here in Canada that do this kind of work which would fall under what you are asking. Note that the disability may be a mental health issue such as depression or anxiety as well as various physical limitations that a person may have. Alternatively, there may be services provided by colleges and universities to help job seekers find employment as well as provide resume writing advice and mock interviews. 

Keep in mind that you are calling because you want to follow-up as you didn't hear back after the e-mail about what is the next step here. Thus, one call isn't likely to make you seem like a pest. Now, if you called daily for the next 2 weeks then I could see you being a pest. Don't forget that if you get the recruiter's voice mail there may be an explanation there that the recruiter may be away on vacation for this week or something. I'd suggest waiting if you know of some point in the future that can act as a deadline. "We'll know by the middle of next week," would be a message that tells me to call on Wednesday or Thursday if I don't hear before that point in time. At this point, you don't have any such deadline so you call and ask for an update as well as what can be done for the next steps that may come soon. 

This is an option where I'd be aware of at what point are you making this request. Do you have enough of a relationship that this person isn't going to refer you to places that wouldn't work. 

This does seem a bit suspicious to my mind. I'd likely call B back to confirm what are the parts to be hidden. If it is just his name, then I could understand that part of him not wanting you to call up A and tell them, "Hey, you remember this guy B? Now he is working for C..." which is just gossiping and not that productive. On the other side, if he is telling you not to tell A that you are working with C that would be a big red flag to my mind. I've often had recruiting firms ask if I'm working with other firms and I believe it is fine to disclose the name of the firms. 

In most new roles, the learning curve is par for the course. The key is being able to get tangible results of bugs fixed, features implemented, and helping keep a team on track, as some of the minor details will get picked up indirectly. 

Do you really believe you couldn't present a talk on a subject of something you've done but haven't mastered? In some development places there can be demonstrations of a system that usually are done while it is still being built. Those builders are wanting feedback as sometimes it is more important to know whether or not something is going on the right track. Consider how you posted this question and may well now have seen much more that can be done. 

They can though it is worth noting what kind of achievement you mean here. A Nobel prize would likely trump that I'd imagine. However, if you mean something less grand then perhaps not. The key is how well is this to be something that is rather rare within your industry to do that would enable you to be among .0001% of the population as for rather rare people exceptions may well be made. 

As I stated in a comment, I would consider having a discussion with management about if you did work extra hours what could this mean: 

I'd interpret pragmatic as realistic here where the key is to understand the difference between what is ideal and what can be done so that something does get done. For example, a doctor often has to be pragmatic in giving a diagnosis compared to ordering hundreds of tests to be 99.9999999% certain of the result. Thus, the doctor choosing which kinds of questions to ask, what tests to do with the patient right there, what lab work to order would all be examples of the doctor being pragmatic. Similarly, if one works in IT, there can be a similar pragmatism in the sense of what is realistic to have in a system so that the software does ship even though it may have some bugs in it. Rather than try to have "bug free" software that is quite idealistic, the system goes out with some bugs that may get fixed or may stay as in some cases people are used to some software having bugs in it. 

Generally, pay packages break down into salary, stock options, bonuses, time off, and other benefits, so in a sense it is included. The n dollars presumes you will use the 10 days of vacation time and thus it isn't necessarily a bonus that one can get an extra $x dollars by not taking time off though some companies may allow an employee to cash out their vacation time. When someone says they make a 100k a year that would likely be a combination of base salary, overtime and bonuses which could be cash or restricted stock, but not necessarily the monetary value of other benefits like health insurance or other things that may be covered by the company. I've worked in Canada and the US, so there may be differences on location here. 

The question is designed to be a fishing expedition to my mind. What kind of assumptions would one make? How does one phrase the questions on the undisclosed requirements here? I can see the idea of this being similar to someone that has an idea to put an enhancement into a system or application but doesn't quite get what kind of impact could this have on others. 

Let's suppose that the people on your team are jealous. What are you doing to fix that? While you give reasons for people to not be upset with you, are you incapable of seeing your mistakes? Are you always the one that can call the shots without offending others? There may be things you didn't do that caused issues. When you did get promoted, how did you handle that others may have wanted that position and didn't get it? How do you handle your subordinates that may want a different kind of relationship as I find it close to a contradiction that you state, "They are open with me," and yet you don't trust them which makes me wonder how open are they in that case? The "talking at us" is likely in reference to how often do you post comments to answers so that things can be clarified so that answers can be improved as what is often asked initially will be revised as more details will be given. 

The idea here is that it is more than just a "Please show up" request that the person may or may not know what it is. At the same time, it is useful to make sure you explicitly put in the request or ask in the body so that it isn't a question of, "Well, now what?" after someone has read it. 

Sure, it is possible for there to be additional points to consider if you have this in your background. How well it does though likely depends on what kinds of roles one seeks with a Ph.D.
