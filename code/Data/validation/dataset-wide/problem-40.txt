Whenever you want money from your account, you have to bring in the receipt with the current balance from the last time you accessed it, in exchange for a new receipt. To commit a fraud, you'll have to forge the receipt, which is heavily punished in any (pre-)modern state. If you loose it, you have to wait until messages have been requested and come in from all dependencies about your last transaction. 

Easily, but not for long. The water in a desert lake fed from the sea would be supersaturated with salt, and the inflowing salt would precipitate all the time, slowly filling up the depression. Unless the channel from the sea widens too quickly, in which case you get something like the mediterranean sea. 

Evolution does not work like you imagine. On average, all women get pregnant, wether they're good-looking or not (by whatever standard). And unless we change the usual human long-term relationship standard to a shimpanzee-style "the boss gets all the girls", also many males of the species get to be fathers. It'd take a long time for that to have a distinct, measureable effect. Powerful evolutionary pressure occurs when a change of some characteristic results in a better survival rate of the offspring. On a small island, smaller people run a smaller risk of starving, without the drawback of being easy prey, because there are likely no large predators. 

The first thing to accept is that the human race does not have a single mind. The criteria that helps someone decide not to research these alternate humans will cause someone else to. In other words, there will always be people that want to study them, but there are some countermeasures. It's inhumane As a front-line defense, make sure they have similar biology. Very similar. So similar that any attempt to study them would turn up results exactly the same as any human. In this light, media (and social media) would begin to take over. While this is merely a superficial solution, it will at least halt large scale, public research and overall reduce funding towards like studies. It's illegal Something atrocious happened half a century ago involving horrible experiments on the species. Over the following years, laws were put in place making the suggestion of trying to understand them highly sensitive. Once it's tied up in politics and made controversial, a great amount of support will be needed to change the status quo. It's complex Just make their various abilities too difficult too understand. Maybe the details span with information several orders of magnitude larger. Maybe some as of yet undiscovered scientific principle gets in the way of recording data. Something physically prevents them from grasping their nature. Or maybe passive telepathy bores all the researchers to death. 

No chance. As soon as they are in orbit, a few US/Russian/Chinese/British/French/? missiles with nuclear warheads induce a Kessler syndrome, and that will be the end of it. $URL$ To make this a bit more clear: Debris orbiting earth occasionally hits other debris, thereby increasing the number of particles. Over time, the smaller particles are decelerated in the upper atmosphere, and burn up as meteors, or are blown away by the solar wind. If the number of debris particles gets too high, however, there is a runaway effect. The original effect predicted by Kessler would not be nearly as bad as to pose a real threat, but here the space junk is not aluminium and plastic from old telecom satellites, but megatons of steel from that invasion army & navy. Those WWII spacedonks are either very lightly armoured, and get killed by the first hit on their ship, or heavyily armoured, and maneuver very slowly, and get hit so often they still die. Every ship has a lot of fuel, explodes, and increases the junk density ever more. I guess you wouldn't even have to shoot at them. In thousands (millions?!?) of ships, a few inevitable accidents with following explosion would start Kesslers cascade. 

If temperature, radiation levels and water are OK, and you find a high oxygen level, then it is safe to assume some sort of life. Oxygen can be present without life, but not to >10%, and not on a planet that has an average of 25Â°C, water, and is not radiation hell due to an unstable mother star. Don't be to excited: Could be the only thing you finde are rocks coated with a thin, slimy cover of alien cyanobacteria. ;-) There is a readymade plan for a space-based coronagraph that could easily take the necessary spectra. NASA didn't (yet) like the plan, because it requires an extra satellite which is flown at a distance of kilometres from the telescope in the direction of the target. So it eats a lot of fuel and doesn't last very long. ;-) Bit more sci-fi? Google for the "exo earth imager". 

Specifically, what is the exact principle that allows a rain dance to work, but not magical pumpkins. Certainly rain is more plausible, but unless magic is a sentient being capable of understanding plausibility... 

So it looks like you have a very dangerous slime bacteria. Unfortunately, the blob's existence would not necessarily lead to mass extinction. Assuming these blobs can starve, they will likely fall into a predator/prey cycle. 

And so many more. But who cares about what they did add to science, we want to know what they can add to science, and there are different criteria measuring that. We want people who... Died before they could release a truly major contribution to the public. Have important knowledge that was lost in the past. (Library of Alexandria, Pompeii, Advanced Art of Memory techniques) Have highly adaptable minds so that they don't freak out when they suddenly pop into existence. Those fitting at least some of these new criteria are. 

As the population of prey begins to falter, so does the blob's ability to find food. They then begin to die off and the prey population rises again only to repeat the process. But what if they are apex predators. It is possible that, since they eat organic matter, no digestive system could completely dispose of them. Following the next month or so, the blob eats the eater, quickly teaching all species to steer clear. 

Orbits of large objects always seem to be nearly circular. It's just the way they form. So this scenario is unrealistic. Different size and orbit of a moon gives tides of different height and frequency, and tides influence the oceanic currents, strongly. If the tide heighs vary more strongly over a month than they do on earth, then, yes, that obviously also influences the oceanic currents. It could surely be predicted by simulations. 

Impossible, unless you change the physics of your alternate world so transistors or nuclear power don't work. In a world with millions of scientists, everything gets discovered when the time is ripe. And without transistors, spaceflight is so terribly expensive that nobody would start a large-scale operation such as Project Olympus. 

You seem to think those people would have an unfair advantage over, and would use it to the detriment of others. First let me say (and I'm an atheist) that jealousy is a sin. Don't be jealous. Secondly, many people have advantages over others (money, health, education, bodily strenght, intelligence, beauty, whatever), and most people agree that the same law should apply to everyone. Thirdly, most societies have laws in place to keep people from exploiting their advantages in an unfair manner, and expect wealthy people to provide to the public welfare overproportionally. Now what should happen? Some of your nonsleepers could become very rich, so they should pay higher taxes. Same applies to other rich people. Some could become politically powerful. So are some groups of people today, and most of them haven't "earned" it. Or some of them could form a syndicate to enslave the rest of mankind, which is the moment to arrest them, and put them on trial, like you do with every other group of criminals. And yes, perhaps they should have their own sports competitions in some cases, like men and women and people with disabilites do. Nothing that the legislative should be concerned with. 

Almost definitely not. The sheer amount of energy required to lift an object of this magnitude would be far out of its capabilities. The only plausible escape of gravity would be partial, meaning it would be trivial to fling small pieces of the blob out of the planet's gravity well provided the blob is intelligent enough to even do that. These projectiles would be unguided and not likely land anywhere suitable to consume or reproduce. 

I see these happening automatically given the wide range of opinions on nearly everything, except the last one. Unless abilities are one-in-a-million and relatively new, they will just be a common part of culture. Heritability would stimulate group associations, and stereotyping would further that, however, the most surefire way to implement associations is most likely geographic ability distribution. Some kind of landmark or location bestows abilities in a small radius around itself, whether it covers a town or a country, leads settlers to gradually become affected by -insert ability here-. The fast way: Take a stock super-power, but then add in a caveat that (usually) blows the helping half out of the water. More examples: Subject can quickly understand anything read, but is plagued with short term memory loss, rendering new knowledge generally useless. Shape-shifting normally causes death in the infant stage as it transforms users into their mental images (including non-sentient ones). Some, usually mentally damaged to impair visualization, can eventually grasp the ability, but the risk still remains. 

I'd say you could easily scale the large sailing ships of 1900 by a factor two (-> 220m long or so), giving a factor eight in tonnage (-> 40 000 tons). Modern materials and technology keep the crew size in the same region, 40-50 people. Going away from full-rigged to schooner rigs or multi-mast sloop is possible with modern fabric and keeps crewsize further down. Speed of practically any kind of ship scales with the square root of lenght, so you'll get around 14 knots average, unless you have a route with just very little wind. Modern weather forcasts will help here, too. Port maneuvers are helped by an electric bow thruster powered from a towboat (pusher) that runs on batteries charged on land. Towage was a huge problem at the time, when slighly adverse wind conditions at the port could allow tugboat owners to extort the profit of the whole voyage. Definitely something you want to organise. 

(Magnetic cooling is used in cryotechnology. Not useable here, even theoretically imo.) No, impossible. The edge of the photosphere has a density similar to where meteors appear in earth's atmosphere. Atmospheric friction alone will burn up your spacecraft. Flying into the cromosphere is similarly impossible, simply because the shadow behind your sunscreen is too small to place enough radiators in it. Enough power for a heat pump would be available, but the sun has an angular diameter of nearly 180Â°. You can't hide from it. In the corona, three solar radii away from the surface, it might perhaps work. Theoretically, with a lot of technology that is totally undeveloped today. It's over a million degrees hot, but the density is very low. Don't get caught in an eruption. 

Awesome stuff is common knowledge Thousands of earth species are all but unknown to most, but the interesting ones (note subjectivity) are usually recognized. You have probably heard of a porcupine, skunk, lion, rattlesnake, funnel spider and plenty of other dangerous or unique animals, but how many have you actually seen in person. In the same way, knowledge of the strange alien ooglyboogly species will become common due to their unique blinding bioluminescence. The mighty strength of the notafillername is something all remember and fear. Amazing accross the universe Not exactly though. Before the final approach of the target planet, careful research is done (basic audience focusing) regarding what exactly impresses the planet's largest species. Some planets won't even be considered in the circus's route because its culture is such a tough crowd. Now as for humans... Being ourselves humans, we set the tone of "average" to ourselves. Other beings would be so drastically different that some mundane actions of ours are amazing in perspective. Just as monkeys are more naturally athletic than humans, humans may be more dexterous, resilient, or intelligent than most other species. 

Magical ability can simply be mapped to a square root function. More emotion added does not mean an equal addition in power. Instead, the difficulty in increasing power raises with the power, tapering off eventually. Where this tapering happens is based on whatever you would like to use (different for each person, random, etc). The second limitation is in context. There are multiple types of situations we would prefer aren't magically amped-up, like 5-year old tantrums or adolescent blowups. A number of solutions are possible. Maybe magic increases with age or maturity, it may even be blocked by hormones. :) Alternatively just leave the one rule how it is. Instead of modifying the rule, modify society. Who needs cars when you can get angry and run 80 kph. Even tools are useless to a degree as beating your head against a wall actually might smash the wall. 

Simple: One bar magnet on the cargo, fixed, one in the floor, that can rotate freely. Without power, the two align north to south, south to north, and hold the cargo in place. There is a motor connected to the floor magnet with a clutch that is closed by a small electromagnet. The motor can turn the floor magnet until the net force is zero. There is still a large torque on the magnet then, so in a power failure it will snap back immediately. During loading, the floor magnets are monitored by a feedback loop that always turns them into the "neutral" position with respect to any passing cargo magnet fixture. The magnet on the cargo can move vertically slightly and is kept fixed in the "away" position by a small spring. That way a power failure during loading is less dangerous for the workers feet, and you don't get large torques on the cargo. 

No, or at least unlikely. There is no evolutionary advantage in having blue, green or grey eyes. Pale skin, yes, in the north, but eye and hair colour are only a secondary effect of that. If your islanders are really human, it's improbable. No melanin production in the eye would be the result of a genetic defect. That would usually only proliferate thoughout a whole population if it had some secondary advantage, for example resistance to an endemic infection, even if it was otherwise completely harmless. A dominant genetic variation occuring spontaneously is something rather rare, i believe. 

Genetic control The first matter to deal with is to ask what level of genetic modification is possible. If we are limited by standards slightly more advanced than today's, then we have a few options. We can.. Reduce or remove the production of certain catecholamines, deflating some riot situations. Reduce or remove the production of serotonin, causing memory loss. (What was i angry about?) Modifying the image of a "perfect being." More specifically, giving a genetic bias towards a certain leader figure. Studies have shown that completely irrelevant genetic traits have contributed to public image. So what if the perfect match happens to be the current ship captain. Kind of genetic There is the ability to genetically hamper the supply of insulin to artificially administer diabetes. This could very quickly nip rebellions in the bud if the only insulin supplies are located at secure nodes. In the same way, albeit somewhat less cruel, get everyone on a certain drug and watch as rebellions struggle through withdrawal before crawling back in surrender. (Never mind, just as cruel) Other Rather than using genetics (a recipe for some resistant hero to arrive), use neuroscience. As soon as someone gives birth, transport the newborn to a government approved "educational" site, guaranteed to improve IQ by looks in PR folder 20%. What is actually happening is basic conditioning. While curbing any rebellious thoughts for the next 2-3 years, the young will be fed direct associations between rebellion and pain, and conversely be given compliance and reward. As an added bonus, anyone audacious enough to not put their newborn through this liberating process will have the child labeled as being in possession of a lower intelligence.
