Aristocracy as a protection racket First, let's consider how aristocracies came to be. The first "aristocrat" was just a thug who would beat up people and steal their stuff. The second form of aristocrat was when someone noticed that if you stole all the stuff, the victims died and you needed to find new ones. If you leave them some stuff, they generate more for you to steal next year. Over time, these relationships became formalized and justified. By justified, I mean that people came up with explanations to justify them, not that they were just or deserved. The question of whether a new autocratic aristocracy might develop is whether or not things will change such that one group will inherently accrue all the power. In the pre-medieval example, what was happening was that the biggest thugs were stealing everything. So they needed thugs who were nearly as big and more organized to counter them. Everyone else then ended up subject to the new and improved thugs, who became the aristocracy. Artificial abundance In this scenario, the assumption is that all the stuff would be created by automation and that people would just reap the fruits of that. However, at the far end, why would the automaters give stuff to the people without payment? This is why the much more efficient United States, Japan, and Europe haven't overwhelmed Africa and South America. Instead, Africa and South America mostly grow their own food. They trade resources and some specialty foods for more food and luxuries. The term for this is relative advantage. Even if the automaters are more efficient at producing everything, they will still have reason to trade for the things where they have the least advantage. It essentially increases their advantage on those items to somewhere between the advantage of the things that they trade and the things for which they are trading. Dependence The only way that people end up dependent on a new aristocracy is if the new aristocracy chooses to do so. It's somewhat of the reverse of the old aristocracy, where the aristocrats collected taxes in exchange for providing law enforcement and military protection. In the new aristocracy, the aristocrats would pay the taxes. It's unclear what they might get in return. Perhaps it would be as simple as the satisfaction of supporting others. Even so, we still haven't gotten rid of democracy. To go that extra step, we have to make the tax something that the aristocracy pays voluntarily. This could occur if the aristocrats are in a separate country. Individuals in that country could choose to provide aid to poorer countries. Perhaps someone has a clever idea. A poor country offers a group of rich people the chance to build automated factories in its country. In exchange, it will give them titles of nobility. So long as they keep the factory running, they (or their heirs) keep the title. Once it works in one country, perhaps others copy. It's a small advantage, but if the factories are automated enough, perhaps they are cheap enough. The factory builders may well insist on total control of their factory. They just have to provide the stuff. They even get special privileges for their personnel, as they don't want to be extorted by third world governments. Eventually this grows into a system where the "government" has no power and the factory owners have all of it. 

Plain sight If your lair must be above ground, then the problem is that you need to stop trying to hide it. Build the lair in plain sight as part of a larger complex so when they look at the satellite images they see what they expect. Sure, if you build a lair on a deserted island, they'll notice immediately. So make the island not deserted. Build a factory, resort, or theme park on top of it. It doesn't really matter which, except as a justification for whatever you put in the lair. Of course, now you have the problem of people wandering all over your secret lair, which may lead to its own problems. It sounds like you have an affection for a certain kind of lair. Have you considered that having one lair with all your minions may be part of the problem? Get your own lair and order your minions around remotely. They can have multiple lairs. Lose one and you still have the rest. And moving inconveniences the minions, not you. You can live in your mansion under a false name as a reclusive billionaire (or whatever). You could even sponsor some anti-criminal activity and leave hints that you are a hero so that the real heroes leave you alone. Meanwhile, your minions run out of their smaller, less expensive lairs. This will also save you a bunch on travel costs. Your minions can stay much closer to their crimes. When they make an especially big score, close up shop and move their lair. 

The only reason that we have metal deposits on our planet is that we were near enough to a supernova to end up with metal deposits. If you put your star in a less densely occupied area of the galaxy, there may not have been many supernovae close enough. This could also help explain why there is no rescue or visits--it's just too far away. Just locate your star in a place where there aren't many higher elements. Elements in the fourth period, like titanium and iron, are rare. Elements in the fifth and higher periods are virtually non-existent. In order to feed a growing population, iron is necessary. We need iron for our blood. So most mining is directed at finding sufficient iron to fertilize the fields. Iron is also extracted from sewage and exsanguinated from corpses for the same reason. So population can be maintained without mining, but any mining is used to cover the expanding population. Your world likely won't have a magnetic field as a result. This may cause issues of its own. There may be other substances that humans need that would be rare. Iron was the one that came to mind quickest. Potassium and calcium are also fourth period, although before iron. Zinc is after iron. Electricity could be difficult, as there are no fossil fuels on this world (too young), no fission (seventh period elements), and fusion is difficult without already having lots of power. Even solar photovoltaics might be difficult. Gallium Arsenide is made of fourth period elements that would be less common than iron. This is not a new plot line. It seems to me that Anne McCaffrey used it in her Pern series. I'm sure there are other examples. 

If you have a million dollars and a margin account, you can short sell securities. Look at what stocks are going to lose value during the day and short those. Wait until the price falls and then cover the sale. Pick a different security and short that. Because there are usually more stocks experiencing a large decrease in price in a day than a large increase, this gives more profit potential. Also because shorting means selling. Shorting increases your stake immediately with the risk of a large loss later. The only question is how much they'll let you sell. With naked shorts, you don't even need the stock to lose money for the day. You just need it to lose money from when you sell to when you buy. Because you're looping, you can find better and better short combinations as you go. There is some chaos worry. Your investments could conceivably change the stock's trajectory. But you can improve the loop. So keep looping until things stabilize the way that you want. Short sales work with your twenty-four hour window better than long purchases. They magnify small, quick changes where long positions take more time to realize. 

Bore a huge tunnel at sea level across the short length of the continent. This would be difficult and expensive but is conceivable. At places, dig down to the tunnel. Note that we have much deeper pit mines, so this is also expensive but conceivable. Use mirrors to reflect the sun down into the hole. Build a seawater greenhouse at the bottom. This does two things. First, it provides fresh water. Second, it provides food year round. Note that you'll need a bunch of these to have any impact. Build photovoltaics outside to create electricity to pump the fresh water out of the hole. Back up with wind mills and above ground storage (when there is power, pump up fresh water; it can be used normally from storage when there is not power). 

I don't have the historical background to answer the first question. To address your third question, I find it extremely unlikely that human rights would be an obstacle to anything in 1810. The question would be if it is fiscally feasible. I'll get back to that. Most households in 1810 did not pay anything for food. They grew it, as most households would be farmers (roughly 90%). A substantial portion of the remainder would have been servants, who would get room and board from the houses where they worked. Then there's the military, who also get room and board. Of the remainder, a distinct portion would be considered well-to-do. So we're talking about a small portion (5%?) who could be considered laborers and make a "typical" working/middle class salary. So to get back to the tax question, most people couldn't pay a head tax as they'd have no money. The farmers have no money because they are serfs working someone else's land. The laborers would have no money simply because they needed everything to get by. The servants and military would have a small amount of money. The well-to-do would pay most all of the taxes. So a head tax seems unlikely. How would a wealth tax be assessed? Would tax collectors come into a household and search for jewelry? This seems unlikely during this period, as so few people would have sufficient money to pay it. A tax on houses seems more feasible. You mention a business tax, which is not quite correct. There would actually need to be many business taxes. Blacksmiths and tailors would not pay the same tax. They couldn't, as their businesses would be quite different. What we think of modernly as taxes wouldn't work in 1810, as banking was nowhere near advanced enough to support it. Our wealth sits in banks while our income is the movement of money from one bank to another. That makes it possible to audit taxation of our rather abstract concepts (wealth, income, etc.). In 1810, taxation was based more on real property (land and houses) or fees (travel, paperwork, etc.). The biggest concern with the monetary system that you propose is the question of how it would get people to support it. Presumably taxes can be paid in faux money, but imports can't be purchased that way. That only works for us because we worked up to it slowly. It sounds like they're trying to mandate fiat money. The more likely result is an official exchange rate and an unofficial rate. The official rate is how much faux money you can get for gold, silver, or copper. The unofficial rate is how much gold, silver, and copper you can get for faux money. The unofficial rate is likely to be better. People will hoard metals and trade in faux money. Under the circumstances described, it is likely that most will export their metal money to avoid confiscation. It is unclear how well the substitute will work in its absence. Hoarding money causes deflation, not inflation. That's why you counteract it by devaluing the currency, which does cause inflation. 

Don't forget fixed defenses. For example, build giant cannons on the moon. No atmosphere, limited gravity, and plentiful sunlight mean that a rail gun is quite possible. Spaceships incoming? Shoot them. The main purpose of spaceships would be to destroy mobile attackers. E.g. someone aims an asteroid at your planet. You redirect it or destroy it. Or a combination of both. Redirect it and then break it up so that they can't direct it back. You may leave large objects in your orbit so that if they break up their asteroid, you can swat the resulting cloud with your asteroid. Or attack their ships before they reach your system. Fixed defenses allow ships to drift back towards their own side when outnumbered. That makes things such that either side can defend easily, but it is difficult to attack. Thus a long war of attrition rather than a quick war of annihilation. The problem with an interstellar war is that it's ridiculously difficult to attack. Without not just faster-than-light (FTL) but cheap FTL, it's not practical at all. Even Alpha Centauri is far enough away that soldiers will be too old to fight by conventional transport. But the energy costs are even worse. It takes nine times as much mass for propulsion as for the payload even for a ridiculously slow transit. Even if you allow for some new form of super energy that produces more than $e = m c^2$, near light speed travel means that there are years after your decisive space battle before they reach the loser's system. The loser builds a new fleet by then. So your huge space battle doesn't actually decide anything. The defender can easily produce more ships, ammunition, and fuel. The attacker is too far from supply. Also, why would you want to attack a society at another star? The level of energy needed just to get there is more than you could gain from the star. Worse, if the other side simply waits for you to get close, they can have a large energy advantage over you. Because the amount of energy needed to carry ammunition and maneuvering fuel is ridiculously high, the defending society has a huge advantage in any fight. The attacking society first has to secure resources in the target system just to fight moderately effectively. If you really wanted to destroy a society at a different star, you'd send in agent provocateurs. They'd use the society's own resources against it. Because they wouldn't have resources of their own. Soft science fiction generally handwaves these problems by making interstellar travel work more like medieval sea travel. Rather than requiring the entire production of an advanced society just to outfit one ship, it acts like rich individuals can buy them. FTL is something of a side effect, reducing transit times to something reasonable. But the real problem is more powerful than mass energy (MPtME?).
