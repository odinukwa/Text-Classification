Legally, this is a much more difficult question to answer, and depends on your employment agreement and jurisdiction. In any case, you would be on more solid ground if you left your current job before working on your replacement product. 

Whether imagined or not, I detect a lack of tact here. If your goal is to improve Joe's work, and not just to blow off steam, you should think of another approach. You should be careful not to come across as a prima donna or know-it-all. Most devs think they write the world's best code, and all but one are wrong. Instead of pointing out how crappy Joe's work is - to either him or his manager - consider sitting down with Joe to discuss the issues that you're seeing and to suggest alternative approaches that will be easier for everyone - not just you. If you try to initiate a genuine discussion by saying that his work product sucks, Joe will naturally become defensive and you will lose your opportunity. Instead, show him the benefits - from his perspective! - of doing X, Y, and Z. If you can get across to him that you want to help him do his job better, you have a better chance of succeeding. If that doesn't work, well... then you can talk with his manager. But going about it this way establishes your good faith and shows that you are trying to solve a problem, not make yourself look better at his employee's expense. 

Everything in a resume should leverage personal experience to show that the person is a great candidate for exactly the type of job that they want. Anything else is useless fluff that dilutes the real message. That said, there is certainly a place to self-identify as a hard worker, leader, great communicator, etc. That place is the cover letter, not the resume. 

Given your description of the situation, I think your chances are pretty good. They obviously wanted to keep you, and it's very unlikely that they have filled your position yet. I have been in this exact position before. Years ago, I left a long-time employer for another position. They tried mightily to keep me, but I was ready for a change. I realized after a few days that I had made a terrible mistake, approached my former manager, and managed to get my old job back. I happily worked there for several more years without any long-term consequences. My advice: be very up-front with them that you made a mistake and realized it almost immediately. Show some humility and let them know that you see this as a learning experience. That's your best bet for success. 

I think it's a good idea to discuss this with your HR department. I'm sure that this type of situation happens occasionally in larger organizations and your HR rep should be able to give you guidance. Doing this also demonstrates to everyone concerned that you are trying to be up-front and honest when dealing with the problem. If your interview is Tuesday, you should contact HR as early as possible on Monday morning to give them time to make any necessary contact with the managers involved. 

If you don't see improvement quickly, have the same conversation again. Don't do it once and let it slide. You need to gain her respect, and if you make the unwanted behavior uncomfortable for her, you'll see results more quickly. If the passive-aggressive behavior continues - or gets worse - consider abruptly ending the meeting or group conversation on the spot the next time it happens. "We need to cut this short, and I will reschedule. Thanks, everyone. Jane, could I see you in my office please?" Then tell her her behavior isn't acceptable and you don't expect it to happen again. That is a last resort, but I have done this in last-resort cases and it almost always gets the point across - not just to her, but to everyone in your group. 

I think the best approach to this is to answer the question in terms of the facts that are known to you. It sounds as if you don't have all of the information that you would need to have a clear picture into the company's finances and prospects, so there is no reason to play amateur financial analyst. A good answer would be something along the lines of "I don't have a clear view into the company's finances, but things seem to be going well at present." 

You sound like a nice person, and she sounds like she is taking advantage of this. Personally, I would take notes as these situations arise for a week or two, and then I would call her in my office and address the disrespect issue head on. Here's how to do that: 

Personally, I would acknowledge the errors, apologize for them, and stress your willingness to make any necessary changes. I deal with a fair amount of similar presentations and my thoughts in each situation tend to go something like this: If the submitter acknowledges the problem, he/she is demonstrating their awareness of the document's shortcomings and their intention to correct them. While the situation isn't perfect, I respect the awareness and candor that he/she has brought to the conversation and they gain a certain amount of trust. If the submitter does not acknowledge the problem, I am left wondering whether the mistakes were the result of sloppy work (i.e. submitter knows about them and didn't bother to fix them) or incompetence (i.e. submitter doesn't understand that there is a problem). Neither leaves me with a good impression. 

In general, the resume is an idealized record of the things that you have done, not necessarily how you did them. It lists where you have worked, the projects that you have worked on, the tangible impact that you have had (e.g. "built a product that made $100m in revenue"), and the "hard" skills that you have developed. The place to talk about your work ethic, proactiveness, quickness to learn, etc. is the cover letter. Your cover letter is a valuable tool that lets the reviewer get a glimpse of the non-tangible qualities that you bring to the table. As Christopher mentions in his answer, though, you should think about toning it down a bit - giving any sort of indication that you consider yourself amazing or uniquely talented will be a huge red flag to most reviewers. 

Sometimes people can be overly friendly, and it's possible that your seniors were just trying to make you feel welcome. Whatever the case, it's perfectly acceptable to say "I don't drink, but I'll have a (Coke/tea/whatever you like)." If he/she persists after this is said and it makes you truly uncomfortable, you should ask to speak to your manager privately at the first suitable opportunity and explain your objections. 

You seem to be wondering how you can help your resource be successful and provide as much value as possible. In your role as a senior manager, here's how you can help: 

You didn't specify your country, but you have stated that you signed no employee agreement and that your HR representative says that you don't have a legal obligation to stay. In this case the question seems to be whether you have a moral or ethical obligation to stay. There is always an implied agreement when you work for a company. It goes something like this: The company will provide a particular type of work, and you will perform that work to the best of your ability. In this case, the company does not appear to be living up to its promises. You're doing work that you were not hired to do, and that isn't in your area of expertise. You're being set up to fail. The implied agreement has been breached. In my mind you're perfectly within your rights to resign and seek other employment, and should not feel guilty in doing so. Don't let an incompetent and abusive supervisor bully you into staying. That's not a good deal for you (you'll be miserable), and it's also not a good deal for the company (you won't deliver good work). A reasonable boss would realize this, but unfortunately that's not the type that you have. Better to move on. 

I can't imagine how this could affect your boss's perception of you in a negative way. He obviously thought enough of you to hire you in your current role, and your performance should certainly be a more important aspect of his perception than anything that happened previously. That's especially true if your previous attempt at landing a job with the company happened years ago. Being turned down for a particular position does not necessarily mean that you have any personal or professional deficiencies. Maybe the previous hiring manager found a better fit based upon specific skills, internal considerations, or team personality. A perceptive manager would realize this and would not hold your previous experience against you. 

Your best bet is to let your current manager form his own opinion. Most good managers will reserve judgment and make up their own minds in a similar situation rather than depending overly on what they have been told. It's particularly important to get off to a good start with your new manager since he is in a different location, as he won't have as much opportunity to get to know you as a person. If you build up a good rapport with your manager, you may be able to mention in passing that you had a bad experience in your last review. On the other hand, if you can build a good level of trust and confidence, he's probably going to take any external feedback with a grain of salt anyway, so mentioning your previous problems is unlikely to be necessary. 

I'm the IT Director (CIO) for a team of approximately 40 people. My organization prides itself on treating employees well, and many of my team members have been here for 10 years or more, progressing through different roles as openings arise. It's a tight-knit group that works very well together. I have been in this position for only 18 months, having been hired from outside; the previous (very beloved) IT Director is now COO and has been with the firm for 25 years. I have 7 managers and one Assistant Director on my team. Since I arrived, one manager has left to pursue a large promotion at another firm (Director-level). A few months later, my Assistant Director, who has had a long-term plan to retire to Florida, announced that she would be moving later this year. Last week, another manager announced that he was leaving. I believe that it's important to reassure my staff that these events aren't connected, and that I'm not trying to get rid of the old management team in order to install my own. How can I do this most effectively without seeming to be defensive? EDIT: As a followup, I was able to promote from within for this position. Thanks to everyone for the suggestions. 

It seems to me that this may be a symptom of a bigger problem - your colleagues are not listening to you and seem to think that the consultants are the only people whose opinion is important. Whether this can be changed or not probably depends upon your own status within your team. If you're the manager, you certainly have some ability to change the terms that your team uses. I would personally do this by discussing, in a private inhouse-only team meeting, why the current usage is incorrect and leads to confusion, and what terms should be used instead. If you're the most junior member of your team, you're very unlikely to make any headway by trying to correct your team's behavior and you will probably be seen as a know-it-all. Without knowing your role, your safest approach is probably to use your own words - "automatically" or something similar - when describing the process yourself. If the consultants respond positively, your colleagues might notice. The bigger question is why your opinion isn't respected within your team and organization, and as this is the root of the problem, it deserves more thought. 

That's just the way the world works, unfortunately. I wish I had a better answer for you, but you won't win every battle and this is likely one of them. 

Maybe I'm missing something, but it sounds like you're communicating fairly well. When you're in a meeting where a lot of complex information is being conveyed, it's not uncommon for different people to walk away with different ideas and perspectives on what was decided. That's why it's important to follow up and ensure that your understanding meshes with the understanding of the other key people in the room. You're doing this and it seems to be working. The back-and-forth nature of the process may be frustrating, but it's important that you reach a consensus eventually and you're getting there. Over time, you will get more familiar with his communications style and vice versa. The problem will probably get better rather than worse. Hang in there, don't take it personally, and be glad that you are able to come to a mutual understanding. 

The first step is to pitch this idea to your own manager or director. When you do this, you should emphasize the reasons why informal requests lead to a less productive and unhappier team. Assuming you get approval, it's important to get buy-in from other senior leaders within your organization. You probably emphasized the negatives in your meeting with your own management; in this meeting you should emphasize the positives, e.g. a formal process will help prioritize work, making your team more efficient and allowing important projects to be delivered more quickly. One way to minimize every request being marked as "urgent" is to mandate that requests can only come from department-level management. That keeps the squeaky wheels in every group from wasting your time with things that their own managers don't consider important. 

This is kind of a "best of both worlds" approach that satisfies RualStorge's concern about omitting the phone number. I have done this in previous job searches and it has worked out very well. If you decide to do it this way, be sure and put a professional voice mail message on your Google Voice account. 

In American business, can the length of time before eligibility in a 401(k) matching program be negotiated? If so, is this considered to be an acceptable line of negotiation for a senior management position, or is it considered a faux pas? 

This is one of the signs of a toxic management culture in a company. Over time, organizations like this become more and more dysfunctional as the people who want to make improvements get frustrated and leave. Meanwhile, the ones who don't care as much, who are happy to put in their hours and go home, tend to stay. In my experience, this tends to happen when people are placed into management roles without sufficient expertise in the field or sufficient understanding of the work that their subordinates are doing. In these situations, managers can feel threatened by anyone who appears to know more than they do. How can you help? It can be very difficult. You can try to bubble up ideas by positioning them as your manager's idea, not yours. You can also try to present your ideas as something that will make your manager look good, e.g. we can get this done less expensively or with fewer people. Ultimately you may find that your ideas will be better received at a company that welcomes contributions at all levels. 

I'm sure it depends upon the reviewer, but I can tell you that I have looked at hundreds of resumes and have never noticed whether the headings on the cover letter and resume match. I generally don't even bother to read cover letters unless the resume indicates that the candidate may be a good match. In any event, the formatting of the person's name and address is much less important than the content, and I don't think I would necessarily expect a resume and cover letter to be formatted identically. I do, however, take a hard look at things that might indicate sloppy work, such as failure to proofread, horrible spelling or grammar, or wildly inconsistent structure (such as making some, but not all, headings bold). Your resume is the most important professional document that you will ever create, and it's important to sweat the details.
