Most formulas estimate your caloric needs by age, height and weight. As your height and age don't change notably, the only variable is your weight. To give you a feeling how your calories adjust with increasing weight I plotted the revised Harris-Benedict equation. I used your height (196cm) and assumed an age of 30, as you didn't mention you age. The age does not change too much, especially not for visualization purposes. The equation only accounts for your basal metabolic rate. To reflect your exercise, I assumed moderate exercises (3–5 days per week), which adjusts the result multiplying it by 1.55. 

The Barbell Bent-over Row is a well known exercise. It is one of the exercises that StrongLifts 5x5 consists of. I was browsing exrx.net looking for a dumbbell version of this exercise but only found this Dumbbell Bent-over Row that only targets one hand at a time, while kneeling on a bench. I have neither bench nor bar. Is it safe to do the Bent-over Row as in the barbell version but using dumbbells? If it is safe: What are the differences between the barbell and 'my' dumbbell row and between the row on a bench and 'my' version? 

Bigger plates have a bigger diameter, which brings the handle of the barbell higher up, this might be advantageous when doing deadlifts or other lifts where you lift the bar from the ground. You don't have to stack as many big plates for the same total weight as if you were using smaller plates. This leads to the distribution of the weight being closer to the center of the bar. I have no practical experience here, but it should be easier to control the bar when the weight is closer to the center. Also consider the time it takes to change the plates, if you want to add 40kg to the bar, why put on four plates, if you can simply add two? On the other hand it might be nice to fine tune with smaller weights, I think this comes down to personal preference and style of lifting. 

Having started Parkour a year ago at the age of 30, I think Matt's answer is not very helpful for older people interested in getting into it. Most people I see practising parkour are in their early 20s or younger and they all appear to have started in their teens. My Background My main activities are rock climbing and CrossFit. My experience as a 30 yo The problem with parkour is that you are training in urban areas. If you are interested in 'pure' parkour, this is pretty safe. There are no tricks involved. Just getting from point A to point B efficiently. Landing on concrete is quite unpleasant though. You need a fair amount of conditioning to do it. The main problem areas are with your lower body since this take the majority of the stress. There is a lot of jumping (and landing), twisting and balancing. You'll want to do various types of squats, lunges, single leg lifts, single leg step ups, calf raises and balance work. I also like agility ladder drills. Also ankle flexibility and leg flexibility is important. You may do a precision onto a angled surface and range of motion will be important to get your COG in the right place. And some moves like a cat pass or underbar over an obstacle benefit from good flexibility. Parkour actually exposed a lot of weaknesses in my lower body for me. I did classes first, and then realised what areas I needed to work on. As a rock climber I didn't find upper body strength and flexibility to be an issue. Other than learning to roll correctly, upper body moves are quite basic. Strength helps of course, but no serious gymnastics work is needed. 

I doubt that this poses a problem. As long as there is at least some exchange of air naturally occurring - doors don't close airtight under normal circumstances - there will be enough circulation. As you're running you're causing even more circulation, the heat from your body and the air you breath out will add to that; Of course not enough to cause a storm in the staircase, but enough to get the air moving. I doubt that lack of oxygen will ever cause serious problems. What might be a problem is dust. Depending on how old or clean the environment is, what it is made of (old buildings might have asbestos), and how you breath under exhaustion (I often start to breath through my mouth), it could be problematic. Another issue might be humidity, if the environment is too wet, it might encourage molds to grow, breathing their spores isn't really something you should do on a regular basis. 

Note the peak around the holidays (christmas and new years eve). The rise in February was due to a project I had to work on, where I spent most of the time in front of the computer, eating pizza and finishing the evening with some beers. (So no workouts and no calorie-counting) Of course you don't have to weigh yourself more than once a day, however, try to do it at the same time of the day (eg after toilet, before breakfast). I only did it because it was fun to do, I need this aspect of gamification to keep me motivated. And it is funny to observe differences in weight before a tour with the bike and afterwards. If you are lifting you will build muscle, too. Don't focus too much on loosing weight, so you don't interfere with the process of muscle generation. 

The slats help you scale down the exercises so you don't have to do them legless. So you can start using them now. Then you really just do patterns. Starting with both hands on the same rung: 

I started skipping when I started CrossFit. If you are not good at skipping and are trying to get good enough for fitness, you should look for a rope that spins nicely, is moderately thick and isn't too heavy. 

I am not a good runner. I am definitely not a distance runner. My foray into running styles was an exercise to manage a minor knee injury. So my running style is entirely to do with injury prevention. I've tried forefoot running, but that gave me very sore calfs. I can't say that it is wrong. I still tend to land more on my forefoot if I sprint. Still a big improvement on my legs and knees. At my gym, the trainer has adopted the Pose method. As far as I understand, this encourages a mid-foot landing. As far as comfort and injury prevention goes, this has been the best method for me. Be aware, the Pose running website is really bad and looks like a scam. But worth a try if injury prevention is your main goal. 

For arm wrestling your going to want to work out the shoulder and arm muscles. Chair dips(Triceps) Narrow grip push ups(Triceps) Chin ups and Inverted Chin ups (Biceps) Push ups (Shoulders) Superman (Shoulders) General overall upper body strength will help. These exercises work more than one muscle which should only help and not harm your case. If it was me I would start a strength program that works the whole body. Buts thats just my opinion. Unfortunately the exercises I mentioned do not incorporate your 1.5 litre water bottle. (Perhaps fill it with water and drink from it during your rest periods) ;) 

Unfortunately you cannot spot reduce (localised fat burning). When burning fat your body decides where to burn it from. Doing ab work will build the ab muscles but will not burn fat in only that region. To burn fat in a particular area you will have to target overall fat loss, with mainly a healthy diet and perhaps an exercise regime. 

I know there already is an accepted answer to your question but I thought you might find the following link quite useful: Lower Body stretching Some of the ones from the link above that I prefer: 

Hamstring Stretch Lie on floor with knees bent. Straighten one leg and slowly pull it towards you, clasping the thigh, calf or ankle. Keep knee slightly bent. Switch legs. Quad Stretch Lie down on your side using elbow for balance. Using other arm, slowly pull your foot towards your glutes, keeping both knees together and bent knee pointing down. Switch legs. Inner Thigh Stretch Sit on floor with feet pressed together. Keeping abs in, lean forward until you feel a gentle stretch in your inner thighs. 

When you are training, your whole body adapts to the stress you put on it. The speed, how different structures of your body adapt, differs. Muscles and tendons will adapt faster than joints and bones. Under normal conditions you don't need to explicitly train your tendons – and I doubt it is possible at all – they will develop as your muscles grow, and so will all the other connective tissue. Whether static stretching is good or bad is a highly disputed topic. I personally don't stretch statically as it increases pain tolerance. As cool as pain tolerance might sound, pain is a warning signal, and I don't want to train this away. Some people think static stretching might be useful after exercising; I personally am not really convinced, and too lazy to do it anyway. You should warm up before every workout, you can use dynamic stretching. The main difference between static and dynamic stretches is that you only bring your muscles and tendons in the fully stretched state for a short period, but repeatedly. The movement gets your blood flowing and readies your whole body for the exercises. Eating the right stuff to support your connective tissue? – I don't think that this is necessary. But anyway, a big portion of your tendons consists of Collagen and the body needs Vitamin C to actually put it to use. I wouldn't supplement that, just eat an apple. 

As an example, you might say: Ultimate goal Lose 20lbs by Summer 2015 Intermediate Goal: I want to be able to run until the counter says 600 calories. Current capacity: 300 calories. Intermediate-intermediate goal: Every other sessions I will increase that count by 10 calories. So say you run twice a week, try and hit 310 calories twice. If you go for 1 month you should be at 340 calories. Write down your progress and how you feel if that helps you. At the end of the month ask yourself, was that too easy? Too hard? Have you hit a plateau and need to do something else for a while? Are you on track to lose that weight? Then revise your intermediate goals and go for another month, then revise again. Be specific and realistic with your intermediate goals. If you set yourself something well beyond your ability, you may lose confidence, lose interest, get injured, over train etc. You need to be able to constantly chip away towards your goal, form good habits, and show yourself that you can in-fact push slightly beyond your perceived limits and still be OK at the end. 

Conditioning exercises attempt to increase athletic ability and capacity, but may also help reduce the likelihood of injury. Suppose you're a marathon runner, you don't just run marathons to train. You'd do shorter runs, some strength training etc and this will improve your marathon 'ability' even though your program does not include marathons. I have no idea what the application of treading water might be. The water provides resistance, and you need to coordinate all your limbs, it's low impact, and it gets tiring, so it may have value as a general exercise. 

When I look for new exercises I often check out Youtube and search for the muscle group I want to train and checkout the exercises on other sites (like exrx) afterwards. Some videos I recently bookmarked: Best Bodyweight Shoulder Exercise - shows that you can do pike push ups even with a cat in the way. 4 Killer Shoulder Exercises *Home Workout Routine* - silly music, but good explanations. 10 Shoulders Exercises (body weight) - just some dude doing exercises, no further explanation given. Be careful with videos though, you never know if they are done with good form, so check at least two or three other resources before attempting an exercise. As always: if it hurts or feels strange, don't do it. 

I'm mostly doing bodyweight exercises at home and have noticed that I can do most exercises better after a short warm up session. At the moment my warm up consists simply trying to get the muscles I want to work out in motion a bit. I read a bit about dynamic stretching here on fitness.SE and wonder if it might be used as a warm up. I am not interested in doing a whole stretching session before the workout, just use some of the movements, but with less repetitions, as a warm up to have at least some structure in it. Is it a good idea to make use of dynamic stretching as a warm up or is a warm up for body weight exercises not required at all?
