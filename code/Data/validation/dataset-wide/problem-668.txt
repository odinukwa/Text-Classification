It is totally dependent on the impact. If you run into a wall you want to be going slower. If you hit a bump and are launched off your bike or jump off a cliff you want to be going faster. I don't know physics well enough to explain it that way but I do ride a lot of street (jumping down stairs, off roofs, etc.) so I will explain it how I know you want to land in that sense. Think about the angle of impact jumping off a loading dock, if you drop going at a slow speed you will impact the ground almost at a 90 degree angle, your body will need to absorb almost all the impact (on a non-suspension bike). If you go faster you will impact the ground at say 45 degrees, you will feel a lot less impact on your body. Taking that to the tour de france (or crashing in general, even on a jump), if you roll rather than slide, your impact on the ground will be a lot less at higher speeds, your chance of twisting a leg or whatever is less because your limb doesn't have time to get planted. It might help to watch some parkour, they will roll out of a jump because they are trying to transfer the impact at an angle against the ground rather than absorbing an impact perpendicular to the ground. 

Snap the removed links back onto the chain and place the chain back onto the breaker with the pin facing into the breaker like this: 

Someone suggested going with a 700c wheel to go faster, and after thinking about it I am wondering if a larger wheel actually does go faster. I understand that your gears will cause a wheel to rotate once and if the wheel has a larger circumference it will travel farther, but this comes at a cost to leg power, and why not just get a larger sprocket? So cut out the gears and such and talk about the physics. I was lead to believe that rotating weight is what slows you down, so a larger wheel will have more mass, thus making it harder to push, hence slowing you down. A bike with 12" tires going the same speed as one with a 700c will have less rotating weight so will it be more efficient? If you are on a flat track with thin, hard tires and your bikes are geared to be equally efficient to pedal at low and high speeds, which wheel will make you faster? 

As @Paul pointed out, that other one is for the outer ring, this one, however, is for the internal cone. I didn't see the size difference because there was nothing to compare it too. I actually have the exact 6 prong one you are looking for, somewhere, in some closet, but the bike I bought it for broke a while back and I haven't needed to use it since, ever. //EDIT2 - Here is an example of what to use in your situation, both the external lock nut as Daniel shows, and the spanner shown above (slightly different spanner.) I'd suggest getting a spanner, since they are more versatile than the other brand specific tools listed. 

The tracks do not have many long stretches and so cornering and getting ahead of the pack is a lot more important than going fast in the flats. The gearing on a race BMX is higher than on one you will buy out of the store. Most BMX will come with 44:16 gear ratio where racers will use 46-48:16, and I have seen higher. (There are different rear sizes but the standard is 16 when talking about Gear Ratios, even if you ride 9t or 14t rear you almost always know the conversion to 16t.) Most racers will start with 44/45:16 then move up when they build their leg muscles to handle the higher ratios, but even then you really need that hole-shot a lot more than you need the higher end speed. If the tracks had longer straights like a mountain bike course you might see more bikes with multiple gears and even higher gearing. As it stands, the berms are where you make your moves and getting in and out of the berms require more power than raw speed. I raced 44:16 against guys with 46:16 and never placed lower than 3rd. You want more power than over all speed on a race track. On street or in park you want even lower gearing, especially when you are trying to get that last pop before jumping up onto a rail. 

Without looking at your wheel, I will have to guess that it isn't the diameter of the wheel that is causing the problem but rather the rims. Some rims come with deeper channels than others. The 2 example cross sections bellow will show you the difference I am referring to. The rim on the left has a deep channel where the tire bead can sit as you remove the tire from the opposite side of the rim. The rim on the right has a shallow channel where squeezing the tire to the middle does little to help you as you remove the tire. The purpose for the differences is that the more shallow channel gives you a stronger rim at the expense of making it harder to remove the tire. The deeper channel allows you easier tire removal but compromises the strength of the rim. My front rim is like the one on the right and it is a TOTAL pain in the butt to change tires!! 

I have seen and used a sheepish wave and a shoulder shrug or head bow, never had someone try to beat me up after that. 

First off, hope that you properly removed the links before so you can just snap the links back into place, that is easiest. 

I use 3M Adhesive Remover. It has gotten off all my stickers and duct tape, even some very tough [stuff] that I thought was a lost cause, and has not hurt any of my paint jobs, even some pretty ghetto paint I have used. I got mine at Walmart, but I'm sure any hardware store will have it. Make sure to test it on a small area that is not too visible, like the inside of your rear triangle, before using it, just in case! 

One thing that might help is an internal spoke wrench (not sure the technical term), they are designed to work from the inside of the rim, so you need to have your tires off. They are like a screw driver but with a pin that you insert into the head of the nipple and as you twist it, the spoke will push it out and all your spokes will be at the same tension. From there you can go through and tighten them a little more if you like, just make sure you give every spike the same twist, 1/4 turn for example. The picture here looks like it was home made, and you could do something similar on your own with a screwdriver and a file. This might not get you the "proper" tension, but it will give you even tension. With out a torque wrench, you just have to learn the tension by hand. I listen for the "pop" and gauge off of that. 

This is most likely a contract bike, made by one company for another. My best guess is that it was made for the "XGames" brand by "WeThePeople". ESPN own the XGames brand, but does not make mikes. They originally contracted with Tony Hawk to make skateboards and Mat Hoffman to make BMX bikes. Criggie had some good points, it was spray painted (they didn't remove the headset cups or the sprocket before painting it) and it is NOT a major brand BMX. You can tell by a few key points. The forks are 1" threaded with a "Wedge down the Tube" neck rather than 1-1/8" threadless. The rear axle is 3/8" rather than 14mm. It came with pegs already on the bike, larger dropouts and the washers are missing (pegs act as the washers, hence the lack of washers once removed, and major bikes don't usually sell you bikes with pegs, they expect you to supply your own). The seatstay is pinched to fit a larger front sprocket. No welded Gyro bosses. The headset and bottom bracket are not using sealed bearings (you can see by the adjustment slots in the BB cone) and the headtube does not use an integrated bearing cup. I can't find any pictures of this particular bike, but this is why I am pretty sure it was made for "XGames" by WeThePeople. Here is an image of a recent XGames FS20: 

It happens every once in a while, and I am not sure it is anything you did, just the design of the lock. Shoot some WD-40 or something up in there and just wiggle the key around in there, that has helped me in the past. If that doesn't work, take it to a bike shop and have them chop it and buy a new one. If it is locked to something that makes it so you can't take it somewhere, a hydraulic car jack can be placed inside of it and pop it open. 

My friend Chad Harrington out of Chula Vista made one back in 1993. It didn't really catch on, but it will give you an idea of how to make one. I doubt that phone number is still active, but I wonder if "Turner Drive Systems" is still in existence for some input. You can also read a little about it at BMXMuseum.com 

Any breaker that is designed properly will push the pin just to the point where you can snap the links out leaving the pin still attached. 

Now the link will be too tight to bend easily, this is fixed by placing the chain in the middle jig and pushing the pin slightly, just enough to free the link up. 

You can stick just about any tube into any tire. Some of the weight freaks will buy a 24" for a 26" wheel, I even had a friend use a mo-ped tube in a BMX tire, just shoved it all in there. It works, but the problems you will have are not worth using them for anything more than a temporary "emergency" fix until you can find the proper size. Using a tube too big will cause pinching and could result in a snakebite like flat. Using one too small will stretch it thin in places and might result in herniation which could lead to a blow out (very bad if you are going fast). Walmart is convenient and cheep but sometimes they use inferior suppliers and I have bought a few tubes that have separated at the seams. I prefer to pay the extra $2 and go to an actual bike shop and get the better tubes, the pain saved in doing it right the first time is worth it. When you are looking for the numbers you will want to make sure that you are getting "700 x 35-45c". Some tubes can be used on more than one size of tire, just be sure that number is somewhere on the box, and also why going to a real bike shop is useful, they can make sure you get the proper size. Also, as you can see in the first picture, most tubes will have the size printed on it, usually in white, the numbers in that second picture are not usually what you are looking for. 

Fatter tires and stand up. If you stay seated, the front tire will not be able to carry its weight and basically float, making it really hard to control. Growing up on the beach in Hawaii, I have had my fair share of riding in sand and found that the wet sand that the ocean just saturated is 30 times easier to ride on than dry sand. 

Not sure this is even still an issue for the original poster, but I didn't see the answer I would have given to his actual question: ["I have a mountain bike tire that has stamped on the side something like: <----------front rear-------------> Which seems like a pretty clear indication that the tire should be oriented in one direction when used in the front, and the opposite when used in the rear. Is that right?"] No, the tire stamp is pointing in the direction of the front/rear of the bike. Almost assuredly the stamp is actually <---- Rear/Front ------> (rather than Front/Rear) since the industry standard is to stamp this on the right side of the tire. This will put the stamp and colored logos on the same side as the sprocket (not sure if that means anything but that is how I was taught). This is how the manufacturer felt their tire would best be used with air flow and grip, but you can flip it either way depending on your purpose. (I use the logo/direction arrows to mark the tire at the air valve so that when I find a hole in my tube, I can find the thorn easier in the tire as well) On a side note, if there are 2 direction arrows on the same tire, one says something like "Direction Front" and the other says "Direction Rear" then you would flip the tire depending on if you are using it on the front or rear wheel. 

Take the tube out and pump it up so that it balloons to 2-3 times its normal size. There have been times when the puncture is too small to detect in normal situations, even soapy water, but this has never failed me! Even the smallest puncture, like from a brake cable sliver, will show itself. Listen for the hiss and then mark it with a pen to find it after you deflate it (Usually I make 4 lines coming out away from the hole, like an X but with the middle taken out, this pic is just an X, but the 4 lines makes it easier to pinpoint). If this doesn't produce any results it might be in the valve. If you have a Schrader, get your finger wet and put it lightly over the top (I spit on the ground and put my finger in it) this will allow you to feel any air leaking out. With a Presta it is a little harder, but wrap your wet thumb and index finder around the top of the valve to check it. Most of the time you can fix the Schrader using a core tool, not sure you can do anything to fix a Presta (but aside from a bent core bolt I've never seen a Presta valve leak)
