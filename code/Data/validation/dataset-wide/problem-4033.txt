It might help to identify $Sym^r(\mathbb P^1)$ with the Hilbert scheme of degree $r$ effective divisors on $\mathbb P^1$. The Hilbert scheme represents a functor, as does the space $\mathcal M_g(1,d)$, and so you can (try to) construct a map from one to the other by thinking in terms of the functors they represent. As to why $Sym^r(C)$ is the Hilbert scheme of degree $r$ effective divisors when $C$ is a smooth projective curve, this is a (non-trivial, it has always seemed to me) exercise in making contact with reality from the somewhat more abstract world of flat families. 

I believe that Tate was led to formulate his conjecture (first over finite fields, and then, by analogy, over finitely generated fields, in particular number fields) by considering the function field case of BSD. A careful examination of BSD for an elliptic curve over the function field of a curve over a finite field shows that the statement that order of vanishing of the $L$-function equals the Mordell--Weil rank is equivalent to the Tate conjecture (on divisors) for the corresponding elliptic surface over the finite field(the one obtained by taking the minimal regular model of the elliptic curve). Off the top of my head, I don't remember what happens if one goes further, and tries to understand the leading term of the $L$-function in geometric terms. You should probably look at the original Bourbaki seminar on this, as well as at the papers mentioned by SGP in their answer. 

Suppose that $X$ is smooth and projective. Then Hodge theory gives a decomposition of $H^i(X(\mathbb C),\mathbb C)$ into the direct sum of $H^{p,q}$'s (with $p + q = i$). Now there are two complex conjugations acting on $H^i$ with $\mathbb C$ coefficients: the "trivial action" just coming from conjugating the coefficients, which I'll denote by $c$ (and which is conjugate-linear as an automorphism of $H^i(X(\mathbb C),\mathbb C)$ by its very definition), and the non-trivial one coming from the action of complex conjugation on $X(\mathbb C)$ itself (which is $\mathbb C$-linear), which I'll denote by $Fr_{\infty}$ (the Frobenius at $\infty$). It is a familiar fact from beginning Hodge theory that $c$ interchanges $H^{p,q}$ and $H^{q,p}$. What you can check is that $Fr_{\infty}$ also interchanges $H^{p,q}$ and $H^{q,p}$. Another fact is that if $X$ is geometrically connected, then $Fr_{\infty}$ acts on the top dimensional cohomology as multiplication by $(-1)^d$, if $X$ is $d$-dimensional. (This is a special case of the fact that the top-dimensional etale cohomology of a geometrically connected smooth projective $d$-dimensional variety is always the $-d$th Tate twist.) These two facts taken together serve to establish most of the claims in David Speyer's answer, for example. What can be hard to work out in general is what $Fr_{\infty}$ does on $H^{p,p}$. Just as an example, if $X$ is Spec $\mathbb R$, a single point, then the cohomology is just a one-dimensonal $H^{0,0}$, and $Fr_{\infty}$ acts trivially. If we then take a pair of such points, we get a two-dimensional $H^{0,0}$, again with $Fr_{\infty}$ acting trivially. On the other hand, if $X$ is Spec $\mathbb R[x]/(x^2 + 1)$, so that $X$ is a pair of complex conjugate points, then the cohomology of the complex points is again a two-dimensional $H^{0,0}$, but with $Fr_{\infty}$ acting with one $+1$ and one $-1$ eigenspace (because it switches the two points). One can make this example a bit more interesting by blowing up $\mathbb P^2$ at (a) a pair of points each defined over $\mathbb R$, and (b) a pair of complex conjugate points. In case (a) one gets $X$ whose complex points have a three-dimensional $H^{1,1}$ with $Fr_{\infty}$ acting by $-1$, while in case (b) one again gets a three-dimensional $H^{1,1}$, but now the eigenvalues of $Fr_{\infty}$ are $(1,-1,-1)$. (In each case the $H^{1,1}$ is spanned by the fundamental class of a line in $\mathbb P^2$ together with the fundamental classes of the two exceptional divisors. In case (a) each of these fundamental classes is defined over $\mathbb R$, and so each contributes an eigenvalue of $-1 = (-1)^1$ --- here the exponent $1$ is because these are fundamental classes of curves --- while in case (b) we see that $Fr_{\infty}$ is switching the two exceptional divisors.) 

So in general, to construct $F$ of the type considered by Shimura, one must construct abelian extensions of number fields $K$. The theory of complex multiplication is one tool that allows one to do this. 

If $\pi_v$ is supercuspidal, then (after making a twist if necessary) it should be possible to find an automorphic $\pi$ with $\pi_v$ as the local factor at $v$. This kind of result is usually proved (although their are sometimes other possibilities) by an application of the simple trace formula. This method will also give good (although perhaps not complete) control of the ramification at other places. If you look at the paper of Deligne, Kazhdan, and Vigneras on Jacquet--Langlands for $GL_n$, I think you will find an expose of the technique. If $\pi_v$ is not supercuspidal (or if one is not willing to make a twist), then this is not generally possible, just for cardinality reasons. The link that David Loeffler provides to the discussion of the $GL_2$ case is somewhat indicative of the situation. 

Yes, the normalization $\mathcal Y$ of $\mathcal X$ in $K(Y)$ will give you such an extension. Since $\mathcal X$ is regular and $\mathcal Y$ is normal, purity of the branch locus shows that the branch locus is a divisor on $\mathcal Y$ (as you probably know). However, my feeling is that it is difficult to say much more than this in general.

The following answer relates contexts 1 and 3. Suppose that we have a morphism of functors $X \to Y$ in the functor--of--points setting of 1. Then to see if this morphism is affine, we consider any open immersion $U \to Y$ where $U$ is a representable functor (i.e. an affine scheme, thought of in the functor--of--points way), form the fibre product $U \times_Y X$, and see whether this is always representable (i.e. whether it is again an affine scheme). This is just a rephrasing of the usual definition in context 3 in the language of context 1. 

If $A$ has semi-abelian reduction, then $A$ is uniformized by a semi-abelian variety $G_A$, namely there is an exact sequence $$0 \to \Gamma_A \to G_A \to A \to 0,$$ where $\Gamma_A$ is free of finite rank, $G_A$ is semi-abelian, and the maximal abelian variety quotient of $G_A$ has good reduction. This is due to Raynaud, I believe, and is also discussed in SGA 7. For precise references, allow me (out of laziness) to cite one of my papers --- see the discussion at the beginning of Section 3.
