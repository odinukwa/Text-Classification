The largest catalogues, such as Hubble's Guide Star Catalog or the US Navy USNO-B1.0 catalogue have entries for about 1 billion object (mostly stars) with magnitudes down to 21. The galaxy itself has about 100 billion stars, but there is considerable uncertainty about that value. The true value could be less or a lot more. Between 50 and 500 billion is the range of uncertainty So we have catalogued between 0.2% and 2% of the galaxy's stars with best estimate of about 1% of stars have been catalogued. 

Comets are part of the meteor calculation. Space junk is a minor concern. Most satellite and rocket bodies are fairly flimsy and are destroyed by the atmosphere. Sometimes chunks do come down. But by the time they reach Earth they are not falling fast enough to form a significant crater. However being directly hit could be fatal. 

It is correct that the sun bobs "up and down" (relative to the plane of the galaxy as it orbits the galaxy, and it takes about 64 million years to complete a full cycle, so it does pass through the plane of the galaxy every 32 million years or so (there are quite large error bars on those numbers.) This idea is uncontroversial, but it gets caught up in other theories that are less well established (for example the idea that there are dense clumps of dark matter in the galactic plane, that can have disrupt the Oort cloud, or otherwise cause mass extinction) or are simply nonsense (the idea that the solar system is a "vortex"). Phil Plait rubbishes this second idea on his blog, and includes some further discussion of the "bobbing" path of the sun. He notes that the disk is about 1000 ly thick, and we bob up and down by about 200 light years every 64 million years. Lisa Randall's is a serious scientist, who would have no truck with "solar system vortices", and the ideas in her book are reasonable, but not uncontroversial. We have no evidence of dense clumps of dark matter, nor do we know exactly where the Earth was 65 million years ago. We last passed through the galactic plane about 3 million years ago, without serious consequences. 

I also googled "iridium content of comets", and the first result was $URL$ Now there is currently no consensus on the nature of the Chicxulub impactor. The observations of iridium and osmium suggest an asteroid. A minority opinion is that a comet may be responsible. The authors of the article in the linked news report suggest that measurements of iridium concentrations from ocean cores may be erroneously high, due to sorting in marine sediments. If these cores are excluded, the amount of iridium measured is lower, and consistent with some models of the composition of comets. So, comets do contain some iridium. The amount of iridium is not certain. Some models of comet nuclei contain more dust and less ice, and so have more iridium. The exact amount of iridium in the KT boundary layer is also uncertain. The low end of estimates would be consistent with a cometary impact. The nature of the impactor is not yet settled science, but the balance of opinion currently favours a stony asteroid.

The supplemental catalog lists stars (and other point sources) that are found in Tycho1 or Hippacos, but not in Tycho2, and is much smaller than the main catalog with about 17000 record compared with over 2.5 million in the main catalog. However I can't but think that you are doing something very wrong in searching a data file like Tycho with vi and a regular expression. You should be using the dedicated tools designed to work with the files, such as the wcstools program Schedar is in the Tycho catalog with reference TYC 3663-2668-1 

Yes, there probably are more. There is a minor problem of definition. Unlike the case for "planet", the IAU has not produced a definition of "moon". There is no requirement to be round, or have cleared an orbit. So any chunk of rock or ice that we can see orbiting a planet can reasonably be called a moon, and Jupiter has, over the years, picked up a lot of stuff: Small asteroids that it has captured from solar orbit. It is likely that there are other, sub-1km sized objects in orbit around Jupiter, that we haven't noticed yet. Juno is, as of 2016, in orbit around Jupiter. However her main focus of study is the planet itself, not hunting for moons. The recent moon discoveries have been made by terrestrial observations. 

The black hole has greater pull. If you stand beside a massive object (planet, star, black hole or anything else with mass) you will feel a gravitational pull, and unless you do something about it you will start to accelerate towards the object. So the gravitational pull (or more precisely the gravitational acceleration) depends on two things: How massive the object is, and how far you are from its centre. Neutron stars are all between about 1.2 and 3 times the mass of the sun, any larger and they become black holes. Objects that are believed to be black holes are know with masses of about 4 times the mass of the sun. A black hole can be of any mass, there is no known way for smaller black holes to form. Now if you fix the distance (say 150 million km), then the gravitational pull depends only on the mass of the object. A neutron star can be at most about three times the mass of the sun, black holes are nearly all larger than that, so the gravitational pull of the black-hole is greater. But if you find a way to make a small black hole, then it would have lower mass and so less gravitational pull, at the same distance. You can also look at surface gravity. Black holes don't have a proper surface, but you could use the event horizon instead. Here the answer is easy: The gravitational pull becomes infinite at the event horizon (from a certain point of view), Neutron stars have very strong, but not an infinitely strong pull so the gravitational pull of a black hole is greater than a neutron star. 

In geometry one may have a line segment, of finite length, with defined start and end points. One may also have a line, continuing without bound in both directions. Then again you may have a ray, which has one end, continuing without bound in one direction. You could even have a circle, with no end, but finite length. Now what is the time dimension of the universe like? That depends on how space-time is curved by the gravity of the mass and energy in the universe. Measurements suggest that time in the universe has one end, at the "big bang", but continues without bound: an "infinite universe" Without knowing the exact context it is hard to be certain, but my guess is this is what is intended. The universe has start time, but no end time. 

Ole Rømer did not measure a change in the frequency of light. He measured an apparent change in the orbital period of Io, one of Jupiter's moons. The orbit of Io can be measured very accurately by observing when it enters or leaves the shadow of Jupiter. When the Earth is moving away from Jupiter, Rømer noted that the orbit of Io appeared to be very slightly longer than when the Earth was moving parallel to Jupiter. Suppose the orbital period of Io is $p$ seconds. If you are not moving and you observe an eclipse at time $t$, the next eclipse will be at time $t+p$. However, if you are moving away from Io, the next eclipse will be seen at $t+p+x$, where $x$ is the time that light takes to travel from your position at time $t$ to your position $p$ seconds later. The delay over a single orbit was too small for him to measure (about 30 seconds). But the delay was cumulative, and over about 30 orbits of Io, the orbit was delayed by about a quarter of an hour. He noted: 

The Higgs Boson can't be a dark matter particle. The Higgs Boson decays into other particles about $10^{-22}$ seconds after it forms. (So fast that the LHC doesn't directly detect the Higgs, it detects the spray of particles decaying from the Higgs). So while the Higgs field is everywhere, there aren't a lot of Higgs bosons in the universe. Dark matter must be stable for at least as long as the universe has existed. If Cern or someone else did create a dark matter particle, it would only appear as a suddenly missing mass, since it would be stable, and able to pass out of the LHC without interacting with any of the experiments. 

The event horizon is not a physical structure. Rather it is the boundary of a region of spacetime from which no information can escape. If you were (unfortunate enough to be) between two black holes, you may be in a position in which there is no net force, and yet you could not travel from your location to the point distant from the two black holes, no matter how fast you were able to move. If you were in such a position, you would be inside the event horizon of the two black holes. Finding the event horizon means solving the Field equations of General relativity. Exact solutions are known in several situations: A single mass concentrated at a point, a mass with a charge and a rotating mass. If there are two masses, then the Field equations have no exact solution, but can be solved numerically (with a fast enough supercomputer) It is the results of these calculations that you are seeing. So, the shape you see is the event horizon, The event horizon of two nearby black holes can be calculated by a computer. Since you may be trapped between two black holes the event horizon will be deformed towards another black hole's event horizon, giving the "teardrop-> bridge->merger" appearance of the final moments of two back holes. 

Remember that the Earth, and the meteoroid, are both in orbit around the sun. As the meteoroid approaches Earth, it will also curve due to Earth's gravity. If you imagine the Earth to be stationary and the meteoroid to be moving in a straight line your intuition is likely to be wrong. The result of the complex dynamics is that there is no time or direction from which it is impossible for a meteoroid to have come from. On average the direction of impact is 45 degrees, and the timing is somewhat more likely in the morning when the rotation of Earth combines with its movement through space. A direct impact at noon, from the apparent direction of the sun, is unlikely but possible. When you look at lists of meteors, many are at night. Except the brightest fireballs, a meteor is much more noticeable at night. Nasa hs a database of boloids: $URL$ By combining the UT time with the latitude information it is possible to get an estimate of the local solar time of the fireball: 

This is an persistent ionization trail. As the meteoroid goes through the upper atmosphere at high speed (sometimes more than 45km/s) electrons are stripped from atoms. As the electrons recombine, the gas glows. Persistent trails are formed by brighter meteors, and can be visible to the naked eye. They may be visible for up to about 45 minutes, but that depends on the meteor. Generally brighter meteors have brighter trails. The movement and streaking in the trail can reveal the presence of upper atmosphere winds. As radio waves bounce off the ionised trails, they can be used for long distance radio communictions. Persistent trails were discussed by the "Bad Astronomer" 

There are a thousand or so stars within 50 light years, most are very dim red dwarfs, and most are unexceptional. If we invent "names" then we would have to learn the names of all the stars. If we want to name all the stars that can be seen with a telescope, we would have to come up with a billion or so names. The idea of naming stars rapidly becomes impractical - nobody is ever going to learn thousands of names which were chosen on whim. So what could be a "better name" than just making up a name based on one's heroes, friends, gods, or jokes? Instead we can make a list of stars, and name them systematically. We could use the part of the sky that the star appears in, and some letter or number. Or we could use the coordinates that the star appears at to label it. Or we could just give each star a number. This way we don't need to invent names, we just use our system. When we do this we get "names" like "omicron ceti" (using the letter "omicron" and the part of the sky "ceti") or "HD 128621" (star number 128621 in the list prepared by Henry Draper). or WISE 0410+1502 (a brown dwarf discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and located at 04hr10min, 15deg02min in the sky) Cataloguing is simply a better way of naming stars as there are so many of them. When a star is exceptional in some way, then there may be a reason to give it a name - Barnards Star (moves very fast), Sirius (very bright). But most stars are unexceptional, and there are so many of them. 

The assumption of random orientations is a reasonable one. One reason that exoplanets weren't detected in the 1980s was the expectation that most solar systems would be like ours, with large planets at a great distance, making transits rare, infrequent and hard to detect. Hot Jupiters changed that. Most of the planets that Kepler detects are very close to their host star. This means that no great coincidence is required for the inclination of the axis of rotation relative to the solar system. An axial inclination of between 80 and 90 degrees would allow for a transit in many of the systems discovered. This is taken into account when estimating the number of stars with planets, with the conclusion that nearly all sun-like stars have planetary systems. Kepler can only detect a fraction of these, but it surveys so many stars that it has found a good number of planetary systems. But most of the stars observed haven't shown a transit. Extrapolating from its discoveries, we have to conclude that the main reason that we don't detect planets around the other stars is due to the inclination of the exoplanetary systems. For analysis of the probabilities involved in transiting exoplanets, you can consult Transit Probabilities for Stars with Stellar Inclination Constraints
