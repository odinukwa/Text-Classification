Another note: We might assume that some of the higher-ups still have access to some types of technology. They would likely be the only people even worried about implementing such a system. Not to mention people who have already implemented systems today. I don't know of an example, but I bet someone in the world has compiled human history and knowledge and already thought up and implemented such a system. In a "Slow Apocalypse" as has been described, such a system that was already implemented (pre-slow-apocalypse) would be in effect. It would already be doing the action of preserving knowledge.

Not yet. In 2008 I wrote an overview/roadmap of what we knew back then about whole brain emulation, the scanning and computational reconstruction of brains. The main scheme I assumed was a slice-and-dice scanning method where the tissue is mapped on the sub-cellular level. In Apprendix E I gave the reasons for why I did not explore non-destructive scanning methods in detail. However, I had a long debate with Robert Freitas Jr. about using nanofibers, manufactured using mature nanotechnology, to connect every neuron more or less to external read-out devices. The details of the sensing can be read in section 4.8.6 and subsequent pages, and the fiber network is described in section 7.3.1 of his book Nanomedicine Vol I. I think there is nothing physically impossible about this scheme. However, I think the medical engineering challenges are worse than he thought: beside needing fairly advanced nanomachinery it also needs to interact with a dynamic, soft environment that is pretty sensitive and responds. Robert argued back; basically, see Nanomedicine Vol IIA for his assessment, especially section 15.3.6.5. My view is that we will use destructive methods long before we can do the actual read-out using electrodes. That requires a lot of technology development, both of nanotechnology but also handling a messy biological environment. But I do not think it is impossible, just hard and slow. As a further twist, the synthetic biology people are getting involved in the game by thinking about "molecular tickertape", where signals are recorded on DNA inside cells, and "DNA bar codes" where the cell connectivity is recorded. Of course, the current vision they have for reading this involves putting the brain in a blender and then sequencing the DNA pieces... 

I am concerned that this species has too much of a difficulty to reproduce to make it viable or at least believable. You would think that such a species would probably have gone extinct. I would like the species to be sustainable. My main question is: how can I make this species viable? What can I add to their culture / world / other to make their existence believable? In other words: are there any prerequisites I need to fulfil for it to work? My first idea is to embed the 'find your soul mate' more into their culture, making it a major point on everyone's agenda. I'm not sure yet if this fits the world as it is in my mind, and would love some more input. I'm okay with the idea that the difficult connection as mentioned in the major issue above is more of a recent thing, and that in the past it was a lot easier. But that does not prevent them from going extinct in the (near) future. *Difficult meaning that if the partner is not right, the connection can not be made completely and reproduction is not possible. This goes, of course, both ways. Whether a partner is 'right' depends more on the mental aspect and trust. It can be build between two individuals, but it takes time. Addition: the size of the population and its viability, also regarding number of children or reproductive rates is out of scope for this question. That is already covered in an earlier question: How small can a population be with regard to genetic diversity? 

I was just answering an old question about hydrogen peroxide life, that might give a hint: use an eutectic mixture of water and hydrogen peroxide. The mixture has a freezing point of -56.5 C, which is more than enough. The main reference I used may have more useful material for this particular plant application - the hygroscopicity of the mixture might be a mixed blessing. 

The highest mountain is limited by the strength of rock; a mountain of height $h$ will exert pressure $\rho g h$ on the rock at the base. So assuming earthlike density and rock strength the possible height scales inversely with gravity: a 2G world would have maximal mountains half as tall as Earth, a 1/2 G world can maintain twice as tall mountains. Calculating the theoretical maximum from first principles is somewhat iffy; Tipler & Barrow's "The Anthropic Cosmological Principle" and Weisskopf gets about 26 km. Doing it using compressive strength of granite gives 10 km. Now, the height of the atmosphere is set by the scale height, $h=RT/mg$. This is about 8 km for Earth. It also scales as $1/g$. So the 1/G G low gravity world will have an atmosphere declining in pressure half as fast as Earth. This means that the top of the tallest mountain, unless the rock composition is vastly different, will tend to be about one scale height above the ground. It will be high up in the atmosphere but not above it. 

MDISC I would like to offer a digital solution. There is a DVD-like format called MDISC which has a theoretical lifetime of 1000+ years. The rest of my answer will be in support of this format. The problem then comes to the reading/writing of the media. Here's where I haven't done enough research, but I know what the requirements would be, and I think it would be possible to construct a device that can reliably operate over millennia. 

In your world described above, there can be forms of renewable energy, and I would imagine one computer could run on such a power source, so #1 is covered. This could be implemented with Solar, Wind, even a Water wheel. A water tower can be an energy storage solution as well (instead of deteriorating batteries). Numbers 2-4 are where I'm not sure as much. Here's what I do know: Military computers are designed to last. They take into account impacts, water damage, rust, particulates, and even radiation. Satellite computers use radiation hardened circuitry that resists radiation interference. They are also designed to tolerate extreme temperature environments. Hence I believe #2 can be overcome with some design work. This of course assumes it's not too late to acquire such technology. Numbers 3 and 4 are more difficult: Current MDISC technology seems to be used with our modern DVD/CD reader/writers. I haven't looked very hard, but it doesn't seem like a durable (withstanding hundreds of years) reader/writer currently exists. I suppose the assumption of MDISC is that we'll still have those around in the millennia. That's the problem of #3. I would guess that similar Military designs could be applied to a keyboard and a screen that would make them durable enough for a long amount of time. Ditch the mouse idea altogether. Perhaps create a custom OS that's optimized for keyboard-only use. This would help the case for #4. Of course then this durable computing machine would have to be replicated, along with the ~700 MDISCs (15,000GB / 23GB = ~653 discs and let's be sure to have some replacements) and then distributed to the several "knowledge safe-houses" that would be set up. This again assumes it's not too late to acquire the necessary components. Pros: 

(By coincidence I was finishing a section of my book dealing with mining black hole energy today) Harvesting energy from stars is easy. But it turns out that the tech (Dyson spheres) you need for it allows harvesting energy from black hole accretion in a stationary way, and this can be very efficient. No, the Penrose process is not the best real or theoretical method of energy harvesting. More detail, and a suggestion for a theoretical but science-based cool way of tapping black holes: The Penrose process extracts angular momentum from a rotating black hole. It is not an easy trick to pull off, but one can do it in various ways (particles, superradiance, matter-antimatter reactions producing pairs of gamma ray beams where one is sacrificed and the other picked up outside...). However, eventually the angular momentum will run out. It is not a renewable source, even though it is big. The most efficient way we know can extract energy from matter and a black hole is accretion disks and jets, since we have observed them. Matter falling into an accretion disk is losing its potential energy as it spirals in, radiating it away. We have good reason to think that the mass-energy conversion efficiency is up to 5.72% for stationary black holes and up to 42.3% (!) for rotating black holes (neutron stars give about 23%). By comparison, fusion is just 0.075%, and stars worse. That energy can be collected using a Dyson sphere (a fairly standard one, if high temperature, for a stellar mass black hole; a very big 1000 AU one for galactic black holes - as you get close to the Eddington luminosity I recommend carbon-tungsten statites or the alloys related to Ta$_4$HfC$_5$). But there is more! The accretion process produces jets that can be about as luminous as the the disk itself thanks to complex electromagnetic effects in the swirling plasma. This is basically a Penrose process but electromagnetic (the Blandfordâ€“Znajek process), and possible to replenish by adding matter with angular momentum to the disk. That energy can also be collected using suitable megascale engineering (think giant coils). Catching gravitational radiation looks very hard (weak coupling to matter), even though up to 1/8 of the masses of merging black holes are emitted in one burst. Here is the thing that might make the story/worldbuilding fun: Hawking radiation is a mere trickle, and mostly of interest for far, far future civilisations when the universe becomes cold enough. However, it can be boosted! In this paper, Frolov and Fursaev show that if you dangle cosmic strings nearly onto the event horizon of a black hole each string will emit about the same amount of Hawking radiation as the entire hole. For the right kind of thin strings this can boost the hole output by $10^{31}$ - enough to make a solar mass black hole produce 900 Watt, and smaller ones far more. Of course, solar-mass black holes are about the lightest that can form today, so you need to seek out the rarer primordial black holes that formed during the Big Bang. So my suggestion is that a recent discovery of a way of making cosmic strings (cool objects on their own) enables tapping primordial black holes, triggering a rush. 

This question differs from the question How many humans do you need to maintain a population indefinitely? because of the given context that everyone in the group is the genetic parent of exactly two children each with a different partner which is violating above assumptions. This question differs from the question Minimum Population For a High Tech Society? because it is not about genetic diversity, but the skills and intelligence needed to run a high tech society (which is possibly a follow-up question). Some other questions touch this topic, but they are (slightly) different in either the assumptions or the direction of the question. 

To be clear, they fly by flapping the wings / soaring on currents, as birds do.The dragons in this case are small (somewhat bigger than a big dog / size of a medium-sized pony). They do not weigh much to be able to fly (how much is still open for debate). Does such a material exist? Would it be plausible to appear naturally in a creature? What speed would a dragon as depicted be able to achieve with wings consisting of this material? 

There are some sources of uncertainty that mess up this technology. The prime one is the Heisenberg uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics: the product of the uncertainties about the position and momentum of a particle will always be larger than a certain (small) value. This is not just a lack of instrumentation or even that the measurement will jostle the particle, but seems to be a deep part of how quantum mechanics works. Hence your measurement of the state of the world will by necessity have some small uncertainties. These would not be a huge problem except for chaos (and perhaps quantum randomness). When backtracking the particles the uncertainty in location will grow linearly with time due to the momentum uncertainty as long as they do not interact with each other. But of course they do, and that produces a much faster growth of uncertainty. On one hand nonlinear interactions amplify uncertainties exponentially, and on the other hand individual particle reactions look random on the quantum scale. So go back far enough and you will have little clue where all those particles were. (This is really annoying since quantum mechanics and all the other laws of physics appear to be time-reversible in the small: in a sense the information is there, it is just spread out to such a degree that you cannot reconstruct it) To add to the annoyance, your measurements need to be stored somewhere. Each particle needs 6 values to denote their position and velocity (plus a few more for other particle states). There are about $10^{27}$ molecules in a body, each with about 30 particles (most are water). So if you want to simulate just a body you need $1.8\times 10^{29}$ numbers (each with a certain number of bits). Note that this is an annoyance, not a showstopper. I recently estimated that using all silicon and carbon in the solar system you could get up to $10^{46}$ bits - more than enough for that data. Now, there is another approach to the problem. Instead of trying to scoop up all atoms and accurately predict where they truly were, make a lot of plausible scenarios instead. Not every past is likely: a cloud of air molecules could have been a toy that spontaneously dissolved into nearly nothing, but it is not as likely as past air. A being who wrote an email in English probably had a brain that understood English, and so on. This will not guarantee finding the one true past state. In fact, it might find a near endless number of plausible pasts that could have happened. No problem, just resurrect copies of all of them.
