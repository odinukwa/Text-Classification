It has nothing to do with Plesk. The problem is with the way SSL and HTTP work. Basically, SSL doesn't know the name of your server before it starts, and so Apache can't pick which set of certs to use. See $URL$ for more detail on this chicken-and-egg problem. 

First-hand recommendation: Rootbsd.net. They are part of a larger Linux hosting house, but their FreeBSD expertise is quite high. I have had a few in-depth conversations with tech support, and always come away impressed. 

In Ubuntu, I have two ethernet interfaces eth1 and eth3 that I want to call "foo0" and "foo1", respectively. Basically, I want something like "ip link alias DEVICE SECONDNAME". Is there a way to do this without mucking in the kernel? 

The "default" category is supposed to get all of the logging that doesn't happen in other categories. However, when I start named, I get a bunch of messages in /var/log/daemon.log, and then more in the named file. I would like them all to go into the named file so I don't have to look two places to figure out what might have gone wrong when starting. 

Is there a way to get all of BIND's startup messages to go into the log named in the config file? For example, in named.conf, I have: 

Make sure to remove the packaged erlang first. Grab erlang here: $URL$ I used R13B02-1, but whatever the latest is should work. Configure with . I compiled it without any of that and Couch died immediately on startup. I think the threads is the important one for Couch, but all those seemed like good ideas. 

That will cause it to skip the next rule. However, you're going to be updating it by hand from here on out. You might be able to pull off something automated with some RewriteCond magic, but it'll probably be tricky. I'm not really familiar with that, so someone else would have to help you out there. If this is only used by a small group of people, then you might be better off skipping this rewriting stuff entirely and just update everyone's working copies. is meant specifically for situations where the repos is moved and you just want to update your working copy without checking it out again. I understand there are situations where this simply isn't feasible though. 

Now, having said all that, you're never going to have more than one repository on there anyway with this setup unless you do something to force mod_rewrite to skip the urls of the other repositories. mod_rewrite will cheerfully change into for you every time. You could add a rule before the RewriteRule you have such as: 

When booting into Linux, there are sometimes one or two lines that get quickly cleared. I think that some of them don't even appear in dmesg. If nothing else, I want to suppress the clear before the "login:" prompt. Is there a kernel command or sysctl that I can set to prevent this so I can read them on the console screen after booting? 

I have been using RootBSD ($URL$ for years and remain impressed. Low-cost, excellent tech support. Lots of different VPS plans. 

I need to make a quick-and-dirty NAT out of a Ubuntu 10.10 box. Just "this side is NATted with DHCP handing out 192.168.x.0/24" and "this side gateways to the Internet", and nothing else interesting. There seems to be many choices with varying degrees of documentation. What's the easiest way to do this? 

I have a small Python-based server program that runs fine, but I want launched each time the server is rebooted. What is the least that I need to put into an /etc/init.d script to work? I only care about "stop" and "start" (and thus probably the trivial "restart"). 

I have started a local Docker registry with and it works fine for pushing and pulling. In a script that is going to pull from this local registry, I want to first test whether the registry is up. Is there any good way to do this short of trying a pull and catching the "Error while pulling image..." error? 

I don't think there is a way to do what you want. The closest available way that I can think of would be to remove the content source, wait for a few crawls to happen, then re-add the content source. The reason you need to wait for a few crawls to happen is that the search index doesn't get cleared of the data for the removed content source right away. During subsequent crawls the data is removed from the index. (You should be able to see errors in the crawl logs that the data was removed) 

You will most likely have a sub-key called "Command Prompt" that you want to store your information in. You should be able to script it from there. Here is a reference to what all the values mean. It is for Windows 2000, but this section still applies to Win7/2008. 

Extend your web application into a new zone (Extranet zone) and use Forms Based authentication against the COMPANY domain to give access to those users. Implement ISA server (or another product...) as a reverse proxy in front of SharePoint to do the authentication - this should allow both domains to use Windows Authentication. 

In order for this to work though, you will need to enable the OLE Automation feature in Surface Area Configuration for Features on your SQL instance. I pulled this code from here: $URL$ 

I have a couple of VMs that cannot have guest additions installed, and I pause and resume them with days between. I normally forget to nudge NTP when I start up the VM. Is there a good way to tell ntp to be very aggressive in how often it should check for changes? 

I need to set up an ESXi 5.1 box to run some pre-made VMs that will not run well under VMware Workstation. I have started testing this, but cannot figure out where the @#$% the control comes from other than vSphere Client, which runs only on Windows. I get strong hints that, at least under earlier versions of ESXi, you could do most of the necessary things (start and stop VMs, add files to the datastore, configure new VMs, and so on) from a command line. However, VMware's site is now so littered with related products, it is impossible to find whether this low-end scenario is supported. I would imagine that a lot of serverfaulters would rather not have some of their critical infrastucture running on Windows. Let us set up a hypervisor box, and we'll control it from SSH. If there is a guide for how to do this for ESXi 5.1, I'm not finding it. Clues appreciated. 

Keep it simple. Use on your log file to filter out everything except the directory you're interested in. 

and follow the instructions to reload apache. If it still doesn't work, add a comment below and possibly update your question. I'll take another look and maybe set up a test system. 

That's it. It clearly won't tell you how a file was changed, but at least you'll know that it did change in some way. 

The three addresses you listed there will work with a certificate for *.example.com. Be careful with other names you might add in the future if they have more words separated by periods. The meaning of * for certificates is inconsistent between browsers. Some will match anything, others will match only one word separated by periods. 

TL;DR : Stopping your services is not necessary with LVM snapshots. +1 for XtraBackup. It is not required to stop the services. The LVM snapshot is equivalent to pulling the power, which means it is consistent, but the same as a crash. When starting the service from one of your backups, it will have to do crash recovery. The time needed to do this varies depending on the size of your InnoDB log files but can be several minutes. Once the crash recovery has completed, your service will be up and running again normally. By shutting down services before the snapshot, your recovery will start faster but at the cost of some downtime every time you run your backups. Also worth considering is that every time you stop services, you lose all the warm buffer pool, so you will also incur some performance degradation from having to read data into memory again. XtraBackup is designed to work with Oracle MySQL as well as Percona Server. It's a good option, though as with all things backup, test, test, and test it again to make sure it works before you find out you need it. 

I would like to automate the installation of FreeBSD 8.2 for a project I'm working on. I know the answer to every question in the standard installation, so even a script that just pushes keystrokes would be acceptable. All clues appreciated. FWIW, I tried this question on the FreeBSD fora ($URL$ but only got one response that didn't solve the problem. Maybe ServerFaulters will have more ideas. 

This is a feature/bug of putty, not FreeBSD. putty always tells the other OS what its width and height are. You can show this easily by doing one of your truncating commands, then widen the putty screen. You can see that the lines were truncated. Now give the comand again: you will see more columns. In essence, what you are asking putty to do is to lie about the width of your window (giving a number larger than what it really is showing) and to wrap the longer lines intelligently. That will work fine for and and so on, and fail miserably for or any other full-screen editor. Such lying can also cause display of information that can be misinterpreted because of the wrapping. There may be a mode of putty that does this, but I could not find it. 

Your use case seems pretty minimal, so I would say you can get away with pretty minimal requirements. 

Check out the IIS Web Deployment tool, that should get you started with migrating the IIS sites and settings. 

It sounds like maybe the SSRS addin for SharePoint didn't get installed. $URL$ In the AppMgmt section of Central Admin, you should have a "Manage Integration Settings" in the Reporting Services area if this was installed properly. Here are 2 URLs that discuss the installation and features available: $URL$ $URL$ 

I would first try removing the web part (and solution) using STSADM commands rather than the web interface. If that fails - in the interest of gaining some space back - how about disabling (and therefore emptying) the recycle bin? That might get you enough space back that you can do some clean up work. (This of course means that you lose your entire recycle bin history - hopefully on your dev server that isn't an issue.) Also - if you can get it fixed, definitely switch to WID, there is no size limit like with SQL Express. 

As a report generation tool, take a look at JasperForge's iReport. It can do drag and drop creation of reports based on data from various sources (including MySQL obviously). It is a little more complicated than Access reports, but much more powerful too. The main output of the tool is supposed to be a report you can use in JasperReports/JasperServer, but you can just use the preview tool as a report viewer and/or export the reports as PDF or HTML files. The downside - I think the only way to migrate your existing reports is to recreate them. I'm not aware of any "import" functionality. By the way, if you are distributing the reports to a lot of people in your organization, look at implementing JasperServer - it is a web based front end to the reports that is pretty slick. 

Basically what this is doing is looking at the url of every request and if it is matches, inserting some config rules on the fly before the authentication and authorization stage of the request. To modify it, change the bit, the regex match , and the list of directives to insert. This will leave you with a user file to maintain, where the username is the directory name from the url. If you want multiple users per directory, you'll have to use groups and maintain that file as well. For that, change to and add . 

If you really want your site on both domain names without any redirection, you can use a RewriteCond to pull out just the domain name, and it will be available to the RewriteRule as %1. 

Hit escape and you'll get a menu of options. Go to the bottom and find the entry for entering a shell. You'll get a warning about returning to the installer, then you'll be dropped to a shell. Run to get a list of what drives have been found on the system. You should see one there that is pretty obviously the system disk. You'll want to use the one without any number on the end. Run to clear the partition table. Then restart. The installer should see it now as a blank and unpartitioned disk.
