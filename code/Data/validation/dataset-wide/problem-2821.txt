I think if one is making an argument that assumes there is common sense, and it is basically clear and distinct, i.e., scientific, then it follows that all arguments that won't work on an intelligent but stubborn elderly fellow, ought to be thrown out, then there are either good arguments or ones that don't convince. On the other hand, once one assumes that there is a question about common sense, all kinds of opacity follows. And anything can be justified on this basis, so that the matter of distinguishing serious from frivolous becomes a matter of special ability. Just as not anyone can make sound judgments about music or other issues, basically objective (as a sense is, not as the sciences are), but requiring talent. Thus, elitism becomes a great charge, and many other charges come in due to various forms difficulty, both in the current system of training, the universities, and for reasons intrinsic to an activity which at the peak, only a very few are competent to judge. 

The proof must have been carried out in some kind of formal system, otherwise it's not so much a proof as a persuasive argument. So, we have a proof in some system of the statement 1 + 1 != 2. Philosophers in the subject of logic, and mathematicians, would look closely at the details of this proof. Since all formal systems that anyone is interested in prove the opposite of this statement, also proving this statement demonstrates that whatever system was used, is inconsistent. So that system could no longer be used for serious work. Therefore, logicians would have learned something extremely important about that particular logical system, and they would want to know what other systems the same technique will prove inconsistent. The universe could not be "thrown into chaos" unless one believes in some kind of (dare I say it: magical?) effect by which the motion of stars in the Andromeda galaxy is significantly affected by what markings you make on a piece of paper on Earth. A solipsist might, I suppose, believe that the universe is sustained solely by their personal belief in logical consistency, and hence that the universe would be fundamentally altered by their reading this proof. Most people have enough faith in the existence of an external reality, not to believe that the universe has any interest in what proofs humans do or do not produce. I expect that philosophers not interested in logic and formal proof systems would mostly ignore the result, at least until the logicians explained to them exactly under what conditions they (the non-logicians) are actually using the same flawed system that proves 1 + 1 != 2, and therefore what reasoning it is they need to stop using. Of course it also depends to an extent on what you mean by disproving that 1 + 1 = 2. One might imagine a "physical proof" rather than a formal logical one. If you mean that someone has proven that they can place one orange in an empty bowl, and then place another orange in the same bowl, and no other oranges have been added or removed, and that the bowl now contains some number of oranges other than 2, you might say they've proved 1 + 1 != 2. But everyone's expectation is that actually, some kind of previously-unknown physical process involving oranges is involved. So while you've discovered something that really changes our notions of the nature of reality, that's not because of the "most fundamental equation" being logically wrong, it's because oranges (or physical objects in general) apparently don't obey arithmetic any more, and therefore the equation is no longer applicable to them. Naturally, this would be extremely troubling, because humans rely all the time on being able to count things, and so human society might well be throw into chaos. 

Moral realists who posit a reliable power of moral intuition are often called 'intuitionists'. And this epistemological view is commonly associated with the (semantic and metaphysical) non-naturalism of G. E. Moore and his disciples. The leading analogy for this view is mathematics. We do not arrive at mathematical knowledge through sense observation. Nor do we rely on mere feelings. We have a power of intellectual intuition that gives us insight into the nature of numbers and their relations to each other, so that we can see the truth of basic mathematical principles. Likewise, moral intuitionists argue, we do not gain moral knowledge through sense observation or mere feeling, we use our intellect to see the truth of certain basic moral principles. This suggests a way of evaluating the psychopath issue. To see what conclusions might legitimately be drawn from the existence of people who simply fail to see the truth of basic moral principles, we can ask what conclusions might legitimately be drawn from the existence of people who simply fail to see the truth of basic mathematical principles. If there were mathematically blind people who couldn't see why 2+2=4 or why any successor of a number is itself a number, then would this cast doubt on the objectivity of mathematics? Would it cast doubt on the intellectual intuition model of mathematical knowledge? I'm not at all sure that it would. Consequently, I'm not at all sure that morally blind psychopaths cast doubt on the objectivity of morality, or on moral intuitionism in particular. P.S.: One thing to bear in mind when researching this is that moral psychologists tend to talk about moral intuition as belonging to the affective and emotional side of human nature. This is obviously very different from the kind of moral intuition favored by traditional intuitionists in philosophy. 

-- Caveat emptor I am not sure one can get away with saying that the Triangle refers only to the abstraction, or the idea of the triangle. I would think Thomists might argue that, but I wonder if that would be false, since the reason for not developing non-euclidean geometries was not lack of skill or imagination, but because of the belief that one should stay with the visible world, Aristotle, the great influence of Thomas, holds sight to be the most valuble and pleasurable of the senses. -- Let those who answer answer in their own fashion, according to the way they understand the question. In the interest of pouring some light on the general subject. 

I think the latter can be directly rebutted. Atheists could have an externally-delivered "fixed moral center" from a source other than a religious text, for instance: 

No, he's saying that because he describes himself in everyday language as not believing in the Olympian Gods, and because (he says) his disbelief in those Gods is of a kind with his disbelief in the Christian God and every hypothetical God, that he should also describe himself in everyday language as an atheist. He's not describing anyone who disbelieves in the Olympian Gods and believes in the Christian God, and he's not saying that just because a person disbelieves in the Olympian Gods then they should be an atheist. 

Hegel welcomes all to join the rational society, the one that has achieved the moral peak. That's no different for him than if one were to say that the discoveries of Descartes can be taught to anyone, the anylitical geometry, for instance. But, yet, it was derived by a Frenchman, and one wants to prove that in the development of World History, it had to be so. That is the point of the particularization of the Germans, not Nationalism or Jingoism, and of the whole work of Hegel. One might, to see things as Hegel did, consider the fact of post-Hegelian German scientific inventions, not as a matter of Patriotism, but of sheer wert-frei, value-free, reality. 

What you're describing is a fairly standard form of utilitarianism that works with "expected utility" instead of "actual utility". See $URL$ For Kant, all consequences (actual or expected) are to be set aside in one's decision to perform an act: you are supposed to do it from respect for the moral law, not for the sake of some good consequence. Similarly, the fact that an action is one's duty has nothing to do with the consequences of that action: it is one's duty only if and because the action treats rational nature (humanity) as an end in itself. 

As a thoroughgoing occasionalist, Malebranche held that all causal activity is divine. That means body-body interaction, that means mind-on-body and body-on-mind interaction, and that means causal activity within one's mind. All of that has God as its true cause. Nothing created has any real causal power, which means that what look like causes in the order of nature are really just 'occasions' for God to do causal work. Now, this raises a huge problem when it comes to human free will and sin. For example, if my decision to commit murder is caused by God, then it seems that God is the one responsible for the murder, not me. If I have no causal power of my own, in what sense can I even be considered an agent? People disagree on how Malebranche solved this problem. I think his solution (see Elucidation One of his Search after Truth) was to say that we have a purely negative power over our will: when faced with a false good that nevertheless appears good to us, we can either give consent to it (pausing our perpetual search for good and stopping with this particular good) or decline to give consent (continuing our perpetual search for good), and either way we do not bring about anything real in ourselves. Thus God is still the cause of everything real, and we only bring about something more like an absence or privation. This is obviously very similar to Augustine's way of handling God as the cause of evil. In any case, Berkeley wanted no part of this. Even though he was enormously influenced by Malebranche, and agreed that inanimate nature has no causal power of its own (after all, mere ideas are purely passive and thus have no causal power), he wanted to preserve human freedom. So Berkeley's 'occasionalism' was a limited one, depriving inanimate nature of causal power, but allowing all spirits (God and humans alike) to have causal power of their own. 

The argument you want to rebut seems to come in two parts, the second of which doesn't get much attention from your idealised religious person: 

To add more context, this quotation is his response to the situation he's chosen to consider in this section of his essay. "Whenever I go into a foreign country or a prison or any similar place they always ask me what is my religion". The difficulty here is not about his beliefs, it's about how he can accurately answer that question when posed by some official or other. So, he's not changing his beliefs, he's changing the label he uses when describing his beliefs to different audiences. Russell assumes that to a philosophical audience the word "atheist" means "a person whose beliefs entail the non-existence of God", whereas "agnostic" means "a person who thinks there is no conclusive argument for or against the existence of God" (he explicitly states here that he thinks there is no conclusive argument against God. He has let it go without saying that he thinks there's no conclusive argument for God either). Therefore, to a philosophical audience he uses the word "agnostic" to describe his beliefs. He can't present a proof of God's non-existence from his own priors, which is what a "pure philosophical audience" would understand by the word "atheist". Then, Russell assumes that to the ordinary man in the street, "atheist" means "a person who does not believe in God". By this definition, Russell is an atheist, since "God exists" is not among his beliefs. Basically he's advocating talking to people in their own language rather than getting too hung up on the proper philosophical definitions at all times. Therefore that there's no contradiction in describing himself as an agnostic in one context and an atheist in another. In particular he sees no contradiction in publicly describing himself as an atheist and nevertheless believing that one cannot prove the non-existence of God. By raising the Olympian Gods as an example I think he is also teasing those who want to draw what he believes to be an overly-pedantic distinction between agnosticism and atheism. He asserts (rightly or wrongly) that there are many things other than the Christian God in which we don't believe, and which if absolutely pressed we would acknowledge can't be disproved either, but we don't go around in everyday life saying that we're agnostic on the subject.
