For camping, I would recommend a disposable, stored in some sort of secure container that will protect it from random stuff pushing on the gas lever. I typically have a second one in a waterproof container, similarly protected from random stuff from letting all the gas leak out. 

First, Freeze-dried Vegetables. Unfortunately, the texture isn't quite right, but it works. Secondly, if you want actual FRESH veggies, then I'd recommend sprouts grown in your pack Thirdly, if you will be resupplied during the trip, arrange a few fruits/veggies from the local store. I know through-hikers will go into town on resupply-day and eat in a restaurant, wash clothes in the laundromat, and get whatever other sundries needed at the local grocery/convenience store. 

As with all fires, you need more tinder and kindling than you think. In dry conditions I once heard the advice of "get as much as you think you need, then double it". In wet conditions, I'd suggest you triple/quadruple the amount of kindling and triple the tinder. Specifically, take the tinder and get it out of the rain as soon in your firewood gathering process as possible. Give the tinder as much time as possible to dry out a bit. Build the fire, but put some sort of tarp or cover over top of it until it is caught. I'd recommend getting 2 friends to hold a poncho horizontal at shoulder level, and then take a few side-steps once the fire has started. If you are alone, tie the tarp overhead and get it out of the way as soon as you have strong flames on the kindling. Once the fire is lit, set up a small pallet with some of your fuel/kindling to get and keep the wood you are planning to burn off of the ground. also keep it as near the fire as you can safely. The heat will help to dry out the wood before you put it on the fire (but some of it will be wet). 

C1 sets off with R1 and R2, same way as before; C1 arrives at the belay, fixes R1 and pulls up R2 and two other ropes, R3 and R4. R2 in this case will be a very thin, 7mm zip-line; C1 fixes R1 and R3 and sets a pulley system for R4; C3 starts jugging R3 and leader starts hauling from R4 at the same time. C2 immediately sets off to clean the pitch; After C3 gets to belay and helps C1 with the hauling, he or C1 can already start leading the next pitch; 

Climber 1 (C1) climbs pitch, attached to a lead rope (R1) and carrying with him a second rope (R2), which will serve as a zip-line and a haul line; C1 arrives at belay, fixes R1 and sets a hauling system for R2; C2 lowers off the pig (haul bag), which is then hauled by C1 while C2 jugs R1 and cleans the pitch; Repeat for next pitch; 

To complement the other answers, I'd recommend drills and climbing with handicaps. If you're climbing a route that's normally very doable, try it with a few variations: 

FOC is "front of center", which is a term for how far the center of mass is relatively from the midpoint of the arrow. There doesn't seem to be a consensus on what an "ideal" FOC is, but I hear anything in the 7-15% range will provide a good balance of distance versus stability (source). It can still be used as a way to measure the weighting/balancing/feel of an arrow (e.g. how front-heavy it is). To calculate it, install the tip and find the center of mass by sliding the arrow along a narrow edge until it balances. Find the distance from here to the halfway point, and divide by the total length to find the FOC. In the image below, the FOC would be 10% because 3 / 30 = 0.1. 

Doing these taught me better technique, strengthened my core, and broadened my skill set. Skipping holds adds a lot of variety to a route, and forces you to not rely on the same technique all the time; for me it meant not relying on brute upper body strength, but developing better grip and legwork. Also, be more observant of climbers around the gym. You'll notice people of different skill levels and body types that you can learn from. The biggest disclaimer is that not everyone has the same reach/strength/flexibility/explosiveness as you, but with those limitations in mind, your ability level will grow just from watching. Personally, going from V2 to V3 was the hardest improvement to make in my 3 years of climbing. It wasn't until this point that I started to identify my weaknesses and took active steps to fix them. 

Now, is that an issue? Should you retire your dyneema sling because of creep? Reading about creeping in applications more serious than slacklining (for example, in ropes for boat anchoring), a mooring company says: 

Column 1 (and the ones before it also) is the one that will experience the most unidirectional (mostly horizontal) rope slippage, and will acquire holes due to it. Column 2 will also suffer similar effects, because after the anchor the rope's movement is also unidirectional. The following columns will have no holes, since the rope has again a free angle to move until the leader places another anchor - that is, the rope will dangle and scatter the snow in a uniform manner. This is in agreement with the picture and the video I attached shows pretty clearly that the quickdraw moves up and then, when it reaches a maximum angle, the rope is constricted to move in a single direction. After some meters I'm pretty sure the little hole it opens at each time it does that is already large enough for it to enter it completely. Edit 1: the situation where the holes are inevitably dig is quite possibly when the leader ends the pitch and begins retrieving the excess rope for the second climber to come. This creates constant, fast rope action against the columns. Edit 2: view from above added for clarity. 

Take a regular rectangular tarp, lay it out such that it is as close to the tent's size as possible. Then take any amount of extra that is on the UPHILL SIDE, and fold UNDER THE TARP any excess. Any water that comes downhill is then channeled underneath the groundcloth. 

Tent: A 2 person tent divides up really well between Tent/rainfly, and poles/groundcloth, a 4 person tent breaks down each component even more. Share with a bigger tent and you should be good to go Sleeping Bag: Go in the summer months, when the temperature will be warm. I live in the Mid-Atlantic, and typically take an Army Surplus Poncho liner as my sleeping bag on trips in the late spring-early fall. In the height of summer, I bring a cotton sheet (I know, cotton is bad, but it's all I got). Sleeping Pad: If you are careful about your sleeping spot you don't need one of these. However, it's always the first "luxury" item that I pack. I won't camp without my mattress. If you can, however, I'd loan mine to the newbie friend, or use a spare/borrow one from a friend. Stove: Most backpacking food reads like: Boil X volume water. Add powder. Stir. Let sit Y minutes. Plan to share food/utensils, and you should be good to go. Food: Again, double up and plan to cook/eat 2 person meals instead of 2-1 person meals. Eating Utensils: All the friend would need is the bowl and spoon. Bowls can be repurposed from frozen dessert topping containers, large butter/margarine tubs, etc. Sure, it will fall apart after a few uses, but you can't beat the price Water Bottles: If you know anyone who beverages out of plastic bottles, collect and reuse them. Wash them out and use as water bottles. I've personally used 1 liter soda bottles for months before they wear out. Best part, it's free (assuming you'd drink the soda/water/juice to begin with). Backpack: Either borrow a full pack from a friend, or pack as much as you can in your pack and have him bring along the biggest backpack (daypack) he has. Alternate days. One final note: You can rent almost all the gear needed from a local REI. I'm not sure if you need to be a member (recommended if you will be buying a lot of gear), or if they will rent to Joe Public, but worth looking into. 

I hope I was transparent enough in my descriptions. Now, let's talk about the advantages of each method. Method 1 has the downside of C2 having to wait till C3 got to the belay to lower off the pigs, and only then start cleaning. But C3 is the fastest of the group anyway: he needs only to jug fast and tight. The main advantage of Method 1 is that C3 can help C1, which just leaded a possible A3+ and is thanking Odin for being alive, to haul the pigs. This method also involves a maximum of 3 ropes. Method 2, on the other hand, can be faster: C2 starts cleaning immediately after C1 fixes R1. C3 can deal with lowering off the pigs and then can sprint up from a fixed line, to help C1 haul a little, and to lead the next pitch. C2 will be cleaning throughout the whole process, so the next leader will have available gear earlier than in Method 1. The problem is that at least 4 ropes must be carried, and that C1 will have to haul at least a little bit on his own. Do you know another method? Does anyone have any experience with both of these methods and can suggest any improvement/comment? 

If you want an exact answer, there is not and will not be one until about 15 seconds after you finish walking the walk. For a decent ballpark, I was taught in scouts: day hiking: 3 miles per hour, + 1 hour for every 1000 feet of elevation climb. backpacking: 2 miles per hour, +1 hour for every 1000 feet of elevation climb. Use the formula, and then take a few walks. You should get a rough idea how your pace measures up to the formula and be able to adjust the formula accordingly. 

After a long day on the trail, I'll take my grooming bucket (reused plastic margarine or sherbet container with lid), and go down to the water hole. Collect some water and rinse out the bandana. Start at the head and work my way down/in. I'll pull off my shirt and then wash my torso. Pull off my socks and wash my legs. I then wash my groin area, and immediately change into my "camp" clothes. I tend to not use soap, and whenever the water in my bucket gets "icky", I'll toss onto the grassy area near where I'm washing, and refill with river water. Once I'm washed and wearing my camp clothes, then I'll fill my container and wash my clothes, and hang them up once I'm back in camp. If the wash water was suspect, I'll frequently then take purified water and give myself a bandana-bath and dispose of that used water far from the watersource. I tend to not use soap if at all possible, because I found that it does not always rinse cleanly, and that residue is a little annoying in the city, it's a horrible rash if it's in sensitive and high-friction areas. 

The point of a vapor barrier is that it doesn't allow any moisture to escape. A middle ground role would mean that it's not good at doing either job: cotton would soak through, and the moisture would spread to the rest of your layers. 

It depends largely on the hammock size and personal preference. My friend's hammock has mesh gear pockets on the underside for storage, but he doesn't mind sleeping with the boots on or inside the hammock. The backpack can pose a bigger issue, because there usually isn't enough room with it filled up. If you empty it out and it compresses easily, give that a shot. Most likely you'll use an overhead tarp for protection from rain. The easiest way (and the way we've been doing it for years) would be to leave it protected underneath the hammock as well (perhaps with a rain cover for redundancy). If your rain tarp setup allows for it, you might also consider setting up a line to hang gear from. 

It's bulkier than the Grigri 2; It's heavier than the Grigri 2; The possibility to choose between lead and top rope modes adds a new mechanical component, which should pretty much weaken the system; It has almost no ear to grab when using Petzl's recommended belay technique; 

Edit: At first I thought attaching directly to the rope from the middle wasn't a good idea because it would occupy too much space in your leg/waist loops and maybe burn the rope, but after thinking a little and actually trying it at home I see there's nothing wrong with it. Tying in from the middle using a backed up variation of the bowline or a figure 8 knot seems ok for me. 

I'm off this weekend for a three-day big wall with two other friends. I read "Big Walls", by Long and Middendorf, but the book is too old and doesn't really mention strategies for a three-member crew. For a two-member crew, the strategy is quite standard:
