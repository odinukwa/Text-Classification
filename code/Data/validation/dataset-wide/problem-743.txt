It mostly has to do with gearing. Imagine we have a big wheel of 26 inches and a small wheel of 10 inches. The 10 inch wheel will have a circumference of 31 inches. The 26 inch wheel will have a circumference of 163 inches. This means that to travel 163 inches the big wheel will need to spin once and the smaller wheel will need to spin 5 times. Another way to put this is that the bearing on the smaller wheel will need to travel a distance 5x further than the bearing on the larger wheel. My physics is too rusty to calculate the force of friction from the bearing but physics public beta opens in 4 days we should ask them. 

I know I wouldn't pay $100 for a rear facing light - Most fatal accidents arrive from the front. All those extra things don't seem useful to me. They are just additional things to break and/or not work as I expect them to work. The only thing I really care about in a rear light is brightness and beam shape. If you are worried about cars recognising that you are signalling to turn get a bright helmet mounted light. 

I was riding my road bike last night when something strange happened. I stopped at a stop sign. (I didn't have time to slow down so I was in my highest (fastest) gear. When I started I had to press a lot of power into my pedals to get the bike moving again. I was pulling up on the handle bars to press more power into the pedals. A minute or two later I noticed that my bike was trying to change gears on me. I have non indexed shifters so I expected that I was just between gears. I adjusted the leavers but could not find a spot (in my current gear) where the chain was not trying to shift. Upon further inspection I noticed that my biggest front chainring was slightly bent. I am not sure if posting a picture would be useful because it is hard to see when it is not spinning. It seems like it is bent maybe 2-6mm towards the frame of the bike. Questions: 

I just googled Bike Dog trailer and got tones of results. I have heard that trailer from "WIKE" are good. Here is a pic of their biggest dog trailer: 

Background: I have spent most of my time riding mountain bikes but I have recently started riding road sometimes too. I really like the position the road bike puts you in and the fact that you have multiple different hand positions. So I want to start riding my road bike more. I have a retro steel Norco road bike. (Although I am interested in answers regarding aluminum road bikes too). I am curious how much I need to baby my road bike. 

I have also seen a few DIY dog trailers. I like this quite a bit. The dog is just tied in so they don't jump around but they still get a good view. Found at Bike Trailer Blog 

Switched over to my winter bike to keep my favorite away from the salt. Can I hang my bike by the front wheel for the winter? Will be in my unheated storage-room/garage/shed. My ownly real concern is the suspension. I have a Rockshox XC 32 shock. Edit: The average daily low in January should be about -15 C (5 F) the record low was -40 C (-40 F). 

2) Before you buy a "new kind of bike" (ie: road bike, hybrid, etc) make sure that you try it. I just bought an older road bike on craig's list for $20. The bike was in very poor condition but it allowed me to figure out what riding a road bike is like. I upgraded a few weeks later knowing what I really wanted. If you don't know what you want I would mess around with your bike a bit and then buy a couple throw-aways. I bet that you could do that for $50 - $200 (not including resale revenue) but you will know what you want before you drop the big dollars. 

One thing that comes to mind is control and traction. I have never seen an off-road recumbent. I am not sure why this is. I have found riding in the winter is a lot like riding off-road. I suspect that there is a reason for this although I am not sure what it is. Just the fact that there are no off road recumbents makes me suspicious of using them as winter machines. 

I would just look for ads and/or post an ad on craigslist/kijiji. I just saw an ad last week for someone looking for "old bike parts in any condition". I kept the parts that I knew I could fix and that I would need and dropped the rest off to him. 

I would defiantly not rush out and buy a new expensive bike. Here are the steps you should follow: 1) Try to make your bike faster. There are a few ways that you can do this but I am going to make two suggestions that will be cheap and easy. 

I was at my local bike dump looking for a spare set of wheels for an older bike I have. He said that they have lots of steel wheels but very few aluminum. Whats the deal on this? What are the differences between steel and aluminum wheels? Why are aluminum wheels more desirable? 

In my opinion I feel faster/more efficient with clipless pedals however as primarily a mountain biker this is less important that the other factors. In terms of safety alone, after 10 days of riding you should be very safe with clipless pedals. It is possible you may have a few slow motion falls after that but it depend * Not entirely true. I have had some low speed fall-overs on my mountain bike when climbing a very steep hill with loose dirt. Probably avoidable but I am a stubborn cyclist. 

Option #1 - Getting a smaller chainring It looks like switching from a 30T to a 28 wouldn't make a huge difference. I gain basically 1/2 a smaller gear. 

I have wider feet. I would like to find a clipless shoe that is on the wider side. What clipless shoes offer multiple widths? What clipless shoes are naturally wide? 

Just to be clear I would expect pads to normally last longer. I am merly saying that it depends on a variaty of factors including: 

I would really like to pickup a pair of bar end shifters but none of my local bike shops are able to get any for me. My local bike dump laughed in my face when I asked them where I should/could find them. Where online could I get some bar end shifters for a reasonable price? (Bonus points for cheap shipping to/in Canada). 

This summer I switched from pretty nobby tires on my mountain bike to slicks. I was doing a longer overnight trip with a friend and wanted to put in a little less effort. I found that I could go so much faster with slicks that the gearing on my bike was bordering on being too slow. Just shows what a bit difference swapping out the tires does. Here is one counter argument about swapping out your tires. After you switch to slick tires, going the same distance, you will exert much less energy. If you are cycling for exercise and only want to go a certain distance you will get a better workout with studdy tires. 

Summer is here so I was hoping to get some summer reading on the go (for when I am not riding my bike). Sometime in the future (next summer hopefully) I would like to do a cross-Canada bike tour. I was wondering if anyone had read any good books on bike touring (bonus points for across or in Canada). The book could be in story form or instructional. Bonus points for funny storys and specifi Canadian route information. (Blogs are also welcome but priority is given to books, hence the title "summer reading". It is hard to read a blog post in the park on a sunny day.) 

I have never done any trail building but If I was building trails I would defiantly by a Bob trailer. It should fit through single track. It is weighted for 70 lbs. Costs about $410 Canadian. 

I have one road bike that I use mostly for commuting, sometimes for fast alone rides and infrequently for group rides. I was thinking that since most of my riding is alone I should put my tri bars back on my bike. I had an extra set of drops in my closet so I chopped them off to make some bull horns. I now have a sweet set of tri bars. I just need to pick up a set of bar end brakes and I will be all set. There is only one kicker: Since every once and a while I want to do a group ride I would like to be able to swap out my tri bar setup for a drop bar setup. Preferably I would like to keep the brake lines on my bike and just unattach the lines from the break leavers. I had an extra stem lying around so I can just pull out the step from the head set and volla! Went to my LBS to pick up some bar end brakes but this is what they told me:
