I apologize if this question is obvious as I am just beginning to learn this field. I am also abusing the dependance on $p$ for notational ease. The Chromatic Convergence theorem establishes that $S=\mathrm{holim}_{n}L_{E(n)}S$. This gives that the maps $f_n^m:\pi_m(S)\to \pi_m(L_{E(n)}S)$ contain all the homotopy groups, atleast for $n>>0$. The groups on the left are finite (for all the ones that matter), and so they will be seen in $\pi_m(L_{E(n)}S)$ after some finite $n$, so that our localization is $m$-connected after some finite $n$. My question is, what are the lower bounds on this number? That is, do we have information on how quickly the chromatic tower will give us all the homotopy information above a certain index? 

Here's a counter-example. Let $\mu$ be counting measure supported on $\mathbb Z$; so $\int f(x) \ d\mu(x) = \sum_{m\in\mathbb Z} f(m)$ for $f$ continuous with compact support. Choose a very rapidly decreasing sequence of positive reals $\delta_n$. Let $\psi$ be the piecewise linear function which is $1$ at $n+1/n$ for $n\geq 10$ (say), and is $0$ at $n+1/n \pm \delta_n$ (and is zero at all $x<10+1/10-\delta_{10}$). By definition, $\psi$ is continuous (and could be made smooth by the use of a bump function) and $\psi$ is Lebesgue integrable (if $\delta_n$ decreases fast enough). Then set 

Hopefully this question is not too vague to be closed. I am looking for examples of when a construction/theorem that involves $E$-(co)homology or even simply the ring $E_*$ requires an understanding of an some sort of $E_n$-structure on $E$ or its module category. For example: When $n=\infty$, $E_\infty$-rings possess the power operations $P_n:E^*(X)\to E^*_{\Sigma_n}(X)$. When $n=3$, and $X$ is a quasi-projective scheme, $Br(X)\to H^2(X; \mathbb{G}_m)$ is an isomoprhism, but not in general. However, if $X$ is quasi-compact and quasi-seperated (or more generally, a derived scheme based on non-connected ring spectra with the same conditions, then $Br_{der}(X)=\pi_0(\mathfrak{br}(X))\to H^2(X; \mathbb{G}_m)$ is an isomorphism. The construction of $Tmf$ naively is only an inverse limit over the category of the Landweber spectrum coming from elliptic curves. This limit though cannot be computed until coherence conditions are fixed, and this is only possible by noting that the subset of $E_\infty$-maps between these lifts is far more manageable. Similar statements for Picard groups and other invariants exist. I am looking for more examples of situations where the normal algebraic category of $E_*$ ($E^*$)-modules doesn't cut it, but interesting results can be obtained only by working in a structured category. 

Then if $x\in f(B)$ and $x\geq 0$ there is $y$ with $f(y)=x$ so $\psi(y)\geq 0$ so $\phi(x)\geq 0$. Thus $\phi:f(B)\rightarrow\mathbb C$ is a positive unital functional, and so contractive. Hahn-Banach it to a contractive, unital functional on all of $A$, which must be a state, as required. Equivalently (but not additionally) you could impose a different condition: 

It's not so hard to check that $\newcommand{\mc}{\mathcal}(A/I)_{\mc U} = (A)_{\mc U} / (I)_{\mc U}$ for the obvious isomorphism. We have that $u$ is the modular unit for $(I)_{\mc U}$. So the question reduces to asking if $(I)_{\mc U}$ is maximal. I think of this as a sort of "uniformity" question, for the following reason. For each $a\in A$, the map $A \rightarrow A/I; b\mapsto ba+I$ is surjective, and so there is $b$ with $ba - u \in I$. (Then for any $c\in A$ we have that $cba +I = cu + I = c + I$, and $\|cb\| \leq \|c\|\|b\|$, which is important below). So, does the modular unit always "uniformly factorise" is this way? Suppose there is $K>0$ so that if $\|a+I\|=1$ there is $b$ with $\|b\|\leq K$ and $ba-u\in I$. Then for any non-zero $x\in (A)_{\mc U}/(I)_{\mc U}$ we have $x = (a_n) + (I)_{\mc U}$ for some bounded family $(a_n)$ where also $\|a_n+I\|$ is bounded below. So there is a bounded family $(b_n)$ with $(b_na_n) + (I)_{\mc U} = u + (I)_{\mc U}$. Then for any $c = (c_n)\in (A)_{\mc U}$ we have that $c+(I)_{\mc U} = (c_nu) + (I)_{\mc U} = (c_n b_n)(a_n) + (I)_{\mc U}$. It follows that $(I)_{\mc U}$ is maximal. If there is $K>0$ so that if $\|a+I\|=1, \|c+I\|\leq 1,\epsilon>0$ there is $b$ with $\|b\|\leq K$ and $\|ba-c+I\|<\epsilon$. Then there is $b'$ with $\|b'\|\leq K\epsilon$ and $\|b'a - (c-ba) + I\|<\epsilon^2$. We iterate, and so find $b_0$ with $\|b_0\|\leq K'$ and $b_0a + I = c+I$. So, suppose there is no such $K$, so we can find $\|a_n+I\|=1, \|c_n+I\|\leq 1$ so that $\|b_na_n-c_n+I\|<1/n \implies \|b_n\|\geq n$. Towards a contradiction, if $(I)_{\mc U}$ is maximal, $(A)_{\mc U} (a_n) + (I)_{\mc U} = (A)_{\mc U}$, and so there is $(b_n)$ bounded with $\lim_{n\rightarrow\mc U} \|b_na_n - c_n+I\|=0$. This is a contradiction. So does the modular unit always "factorise uniformly" in this way?? 

The problem setup is simple: Given a $d$-simplex $\Delta_d:=\{(x_1,\cdots,x_d):x_i\geq 0,\sum_i x_i\leq 1\}$, can we construct a finite sequence of parallelotope $A_i$ so that $\Delta_d=\cup_{i=1}^N A_i$, where $N$ may depend optimally on $d$ in the sense any sequence of such covers must have cardinality lower bounded by $N$ up to a universal constant. The problem in dimension $d=1,2$ is straightforward. However even in $d=3$, it is not clear to me if there is such a construction. My main motivation for such a result is trying to reduce certain problem on simplex to parallelotope, which is easier to handle. Any comment shall be greatly appreciated. 

I think this was solved in the paper: MR1310296 (95m:16029) Dijkhuizen, Mathijs S.(NL-MATH); Koornwinder, Tom H.(NL-AMST-CS) CQG algebras: a direct algebraic approach to compact quantum groups. (English summary) Lett. Math. Phys. 32 (1994), no. 4, 315â€“330. They show that a Hopf $*$-algebra $A$ is the maximal Hopf $*$-algebra of a compact quantum group in the Woronowicz sense if (and only if) $A$ is spanned by the matrix coefficients of its finite-dimensional unitary (irreducible) corepresentations. The "only if" part was shown by Woronowicz, of course. They also show that a Hopf $*$-algebra has this property if and only if it admits a positive definite Haar functional (in the sense Andreas talks about). You also ask about uniqueness-- this occurs if and only if $A$ is "coamenable" (see various papers by Bedos, Tuset and coauthors). A classical example comes from a discrete group $G$ with Hopf $*$-algebra $\mathbb C[G]$ (under convolution product). Then there is the maximal $C^*$ completion $C^*(G)$ and the completion of $\mathbb C[G]$ acting on $\ell^2(G)$ by the left-regular representation, leading to $C^*_r(G)$. The quotient map $C^*(G) \rightarrow C^*_r(G)$ is injective if and only if $G$ is amenable. 

The second claim is false, I believe. Take the multisets $\{1, -1, 1\}$ and $\{1, -1, -1\}$. Then we obtain $\Lambda^{odd}=\{1, -1, 1, -1\}=\{1, -1, -1, 1\}$ and $\Lambda^{even}=\{-1, -1, 1\}=\{-1, 1, -1\}$ 

Sorry if this question is to naive or badly phrased. I am curious about the following problem, given a manifold $M$, how "close" can we find a smooth or PL manifold, $N$, with a map $f:N\to M$. The manifolds in this case would preferably be closed compact and of the same dimension. Close in this case is given by $(f)_q=\sum_i Coker(f|_{H_i(M)})q^{i}$, where $q$ is arbitrary but fixed. In the case of $M$ admitting such a structure it is zero, but I'm unable to establish more substantive results. If the manifold is of dimension five for example, I thinking passing to a covering space will allow us to kill the fundamental group, and thus the degree 4 cohomology, which allows us to kill the Kirby-Siberman class. So there is abound of $dim(H^4(M))q$. I'm also interested in the case of $f:M\to N$ with the cokernal replaced with the kernel, but it seems less amenable. 

Consider a special type of convex function $g(\cdot):\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}_+\cup\{+\infty\}$ such that $g(x)=+\infty$ as $|x|\to \infty$. Then $g$ is differentiable almost everywhere within its domain. Now consider the quantity $$\frac{\nabla g(x)}{(g(x))^{1+\delta}},$$ where $\delta>0$. Can we get some estimate of type $$||\nabla g(x)||_2\leq c_g(1+|x|)^{-\gamma} ((g(x))^{1+\delta}$$ for some $\gamma>0$ and all $|x|>R$, where $c_g$ may depend on some 'local' information of $g$ but not asymptotically as $x \to \infty$, and $R$ is independent of $g$? Or is there a counterexample? 

I am interested in the following question: Given a convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and an $\epsilon>0$ small enough, how many $d$-simplices $\{D_i\}_{i=1}^m\subset K$ do we need at least so that the volume of $K\setminus \cup_{i=1}^m D_i$ is at most $\epsilon\mathrm{vol}(K)$? Similar question has been considered for approximating polytopes with given number of vertices or faces, but I am not aware of any result of this kind. Any comment shall be greatly appreciated. 

Then $S$ is compact if and only if $X$ is compact. If $X$ is compact, then a simple $\epsilon$-net argument shows that (4) holds (using that the net $(a_j)$ is assumed bounded). Conversely, suppose that $X$ is not compact, so there is $\epsilon>0$ such that $X$ admits no $2\epsilon$-net. For any finite-dimensional subspace $N\subseteq E$, any closed and bounded subset of $N$ is compact, and so the distance from $N$ to $X$ must be at least $\epsilon$, say. By Hahn-Banach we can find $a_N\in E^*$ and $\omega_N\in X$ with $\langle a_N,\omega \rangle=0$ for all $\omega\in N$, with $|\langle a_N, \omega_N \rangle| \geq \epsilon$ and with $\|a_N\|\leq 1$. The (bounded) net $(a_N)$ hence shows that (4) does not hold. If $E$ is separable then you can consider (bounded) sequences in place of nets. Thus, I believe, your original question is equivalent to asking when the (left) multiplication operator given by $h\in M$ is compact. [ I stressed the word "bounded". If you allow unbounded nets then the condition becomes that $X$ has finite-dimensional span, i.e. that $S$ (equivalently $T$) is a finite-rank operator. In the sequence case, the Principle of Uniform Boundedness says you have to be bounded anyway. ]
