Please, give assessments of my types of formations from different perspectives: humanistic, liberal, Realpolitik, and economical. Which transition scenarios between different formations can be envisaged? Which scenarios of clashes between such formations (both of similar or dissimilar structure) will be plausible? 

Let’s consider the typical setting of 20th-century science fiction writers, both Western and Communist. Namely: 

Which political structure can be sufficiently stable in such conditions? Very likely, a typical developed planet or other astronomical object will not have significant pieces belonging to more than one sovereign state (that does not preclude some states to extend authority to several planets), and, in most situations in outer space, a state will maintain its sovereignty over its spaceships. I.e., a situation similar to modern Earth with planets/moons instead of islands (divided planets will become an anomalous condition), and spaceships instead of vessels. On one hand, different planets in a stellar system typically have different physical conditions (most notable, temperature), and we can expect that their populace will differ (remember several civilized races) as well, both biologically and culturally. On another hand, some central authorities will probably exist in circumstellar spaces. But how the two could be related in cases of heterogeneous populace in vicinity of one star? Some possible formations are: 

All guys saying “you need 10blah-blah joules to achieve it” lie (although Ī am not astonished with their impunity, knowing how StackExchange works). There are two aspects of their lie. First is an assumption that inflicting a catastrophic damage to Solar System requires gravitational unbinding of Sun. Not so: red giant stars (BTW, a prospected stage of our Sun in few billions years) routinely shed circumstellar gas shells that could incinerate planets, such as Earth, with ease (albeit having only millionth parts of the star’s mass). Second is ignorance in nuclear physics and composition of Sun’s core. It contain a sizable amount of 4He that can fuse to 12C and other its nuclear “multiples” really fast. This would inevitably result in a cataclysm, although not immediately due to poor thermal conductivity of (usual) stars. Why this appears to never happen to main-sequence stars? The answer is simple: because there is no natural cause to ignite 4He prematurely, i.e. before an orderly transition to the red giant stage. If the mad scientist possess some energy beam weapon able to penetrate the Sun down to the core and concentrate its energy output in a small volume, then there is plausible that helium flash can be initiated. 

I think they've already answered your question. It's buried in the math, yes, but it's there. While true that tidal locking is 'inevitable.' This period can be extremely long. The are three factors that determine this period: 

What about the Extended Phenotype shown by certain parasites? Parasite Manipulation is where a parasite invades a host and then forces it into behavior outside its norm. Examples of this are: 

In short, your vampires might be hosts to some killer virus that alters their metabolisms to feed off of blood. As a bonus, it heightens their senses, increases their reflexes and strength and their ability to heal. In payment, it 'abhors' certain kinds of smells, perhaps the pheromones emitted by uninfected humans when they feel safe cause the virus to avoid the area and instead prefer areas where humans are emitting sexual pheromones (such as near a bar or maybe where prostitutes hang out). This would be way beyond deep at a near instinctual level and would be extremely hard for an infected vampire to fight or ignore. 

Let's break it down. First, we have to assume that, aside from magic, this world is primarily the same as our current world. And thus, the laws of physics and so forth still apply. Second, let's apply the Occam's Razor here and go with the idea that the simplest of explanations is usually the correct one. Based on those two premises, let's proceed. Here's what we know. Frank is dead and Alfred was seen with a weapon matching Frank's blood and was also seen dumping a body into the river by multiple witnesses. Alfred's defense was: It wasn't me, someone placed an illusion there and made it look like it was me. If I was the prosecutor I would test the following: 

In a world that i am building, there is an advanced civilization that is somewhat close to 21st century humans. Two of the differences are: they have discovered electricity much earlier than we did and they have never had the idea that explosives can be used as a propellant for projectiles. That's why most of land based combat revolves around infantry running around the battlefield with swords with enormous railgun artillery providing support. My two questions are: 1. How realistic is this scenario? 2. How realistic is the strategy i presented? Is there something that makes it really stupid, or will it work fine? EDIT: The problem with railguns is that they require a LOT of power. So you can have stationary artillery, but planes and cars cant pack a powerful enough power generators. So planes are capable of dropping bombs, fighter planes are not really a thing. And in case of car, infantry would need to exit the car in order to swing their swords around. EDIT2: So, yeah "running around with swords" is totally not the best idea when you have vehicles and can use them. EDIT3: Due to a lot of answers/comments touching this topic: Yes the kind of combustion engine you see in your car is not really a thing in this world. (Not because it is explody, but rather because they have way less liquid dinosaurs than we do.) However having similar engines is not a requirement for having electricity, because it is done by steam turbines (They were very lucky with geothermal energy). Also the battery tech is much better than we have, it is just the capacitors (things that can charge/discarge really fast) are lacking. 

Yes you can in fact make water be solid at room temperature. The only problem is, you need to compress it to pressures above 1GPa. A handy phase chart for reference:
