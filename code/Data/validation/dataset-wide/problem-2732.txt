This has been done, in the form of Lincos. The problem with any attempt at a language from first principles is that it has to presuppose common ground. How much common ground can we assume? On one hand, intelligent alien life could be so alien as to render communication impossible. On the other hand, we can look at it from an evolutionary perspective. Life on other planets would have been subject to selection pressures, as we were. While the specific pressures could've differed, it stands to reason that basic tendencies like avoiding death, reproduction, etc... apply to them. Can we build on those? 

X exists if it can lead to certain experiences, and you argue that X exists by relating it to other experiences. For instance, if I'm in the desert with some friends and I see water in the distance, I may wonder if the water really exists. This means I'm wondering if the water will lead to certain experiences, such as feelings of wetness or a quenching of my thirst should I drink it. To confirm it exists, I'd ask my friends if they too see water. Thus I confirm that my experience of water will lead to the experience of thirst quenching because it is consistent with the experience of hearing others say they see water. So when your friend asks you to prove X exists, your friend is asking you to show that X can cause certain experiences. Once you've done that, you've won the argument. If your friend rejects this by arguing that he could be a brain in a vat, then your friend is equivocating. He is using a different definition of "exists" than is warranted by the argument. Argument occurs in the context of experiences, it can't be used to justify or reject the ultimate "source" of experience. Call your friend out on his equivocation and call it a day. 

The most abstract and theoretical question that can be asked is that of existence. What IS existence? Everything stems off from existence. The problem here is that very fundamental questions may have no answers for the simple fact that they are so fundamental that they are the foundation upon which all our answers are built. 

Short Answer... Depending on how we interpret your question, your best bets seem to be a choice between... 

Unfortunately, I haven't found too many existentialist works with a nuts-and-bolts focus, so my recommended reading list is really short -- two books in fact. 

Here's a different take on it, with a different take on determinism. If we assume time is an abstraction for change, then time travel is tantamount to undoing all the changes in the universe. Yes, this is a can of worms as multiple states can lead to the same next state, but let's just assume for the sake of argument that this is possible. Now the determinism that becomes an issue is quantum indeterminism. That is, in order to roll back to the previous state (ignoring the objection above) we'd need a deterministic relationship from one state to the other, and QM shatters that dream. Just thought another angle was worth mentioning. 

Short Answer: It Depends. Long Answer: Philosophy is a very broad subject, so what you need to learn depends on what parts of it you wish to focus on. Are you interested in the structure of arguments? Are you interested in specific philosophies, such as ontology, epistemology, phenomenology, etc...? Eastern philosophy? Practical philosophy (philosophy of life)? Philosophy of mind? If you're interested in the structure of arguments, or in a critical reading of various authors, then you should study logic first. If you're interested in a specific philosophy, then logic is not necessary, but it can help you decide if a particular view passes the sniff test. As for who to start with, that too depends, but I think Plato is excellent. It's not so much that Plato's views are or are not tenable, as it is that he anticipated a ton of subjects that are still discussed today. In fact, a common quote is that the history of philosophy is a footnote to Plato. Whether true or not, it gives you an idea of his influence. Where to go from there depends on your interests. There's a ton of key figures, and even a brief overview would greatly increase the length of this response. One thing that helps if you are reading on a particular topic is to read the key figures in order, as they often build upon or respond to one another. For instance, much of Kant can be read as a response to Hume, Berkeley's views make most sense when seen as a response to "substance theory", and even Existentialism's motto of "Existence Precedes Essence" can be seen as a response to Plato. 

I've read a bit on Spinoza and he still confuses me, yet since no one's answered your question, I'll attempt an answer. In (1) Spinoza is referring to a thing that must logically exist, that is something that would be a logical contradiction if it doesn't exist. For the record, I don't think any such thing exists. An example of (2) is compassion. If I meet a compassionate person, and I can imagine a more compassionate person, then the first person's compassion is finite after it's kind. I don't know how a thought delimits another thought, as thought seems to be representational and as such, one would think the concepts conveyed by the thoughts would be covered by finitude. In (3) he's talking about something that is independent and uncaused. The only thing that fulfills this requirement (IMO) is reality as a whole, as everything else is determined by how it interacts. 

We sometimes pair objects with unnecessary ideas/senses. However, this is rare because we often encounter objects many times and thus refine our identification based on what stays stable across those encounters. Let's say you don't know what a pencil is... One day you hear someone ask for a pencil and get a long, yellow object with an eraser. Why would you associate a temperature, sound or other property with this object? But maybe you think pencils must all be yellow and long? Well, multiple encounters should change that. For instance, later you hear a teacher tell the students to pick up their pencils, and you notice some students picking up red, thick objects. Now you've got some contradictory experience and so you ask what does this experience have in common with your previous one? Clearly all pencils don't need to be yellow and long, so what should they have? With more encounters, should keep narrowing the stable properties until your definition of pencil is good enough to fulfill all the social and relational needs of that word. However, there's another angle here. Senses are not the full story and may not even be that important; purpose may be more important. For instance, whenever you encounter pencils, it's usually in the role of writing and erasing, so you may think of a pencil as that which writes and erases. In fact, if you had a model of a pencil (which looks like an ideal pencil) and a very unorthodox pencil and someone asks you for a pencil, you're likely to hand them the real (unorthodox) one rather than the model, since a pencil is tied with its purpose. This means you're less likely to conflate ideas/senses since purpose may trump sense. This process doesn't always work. Sometimes people don't get enough representative encounters to properly identify things. Think of people who suffer from red/green color-blindness. They can distinguish red/green, but they see those colors differently. Yet, the kinds of relationships that red/green enter into are such that they may never know they suffer from this. Also, quite a few misunderstandings may be chalked up to this. When kids are growing up, they'll often use the wrong words until they get more examples. For instance, some children will end up calling all men "daddy" due to a mis-classification, or they may call dogs and cats "dogs" for similar reasons. Even adults will sometimes get into arguments or misunderstandings over this sort of thing, and from my experience it occurs a lot more with abstract objects (ones in which there isn't sensory confirmation which serves as corrective feedback). When you encounter something that's contrary to your past experience, do you update your concept, or do you think a mistake was made? So when we talk of things, as long as our words satisfy the linguistic relationships of others, then we could be talking about different things and no one would ever know. For instance, if someone identifies "pencil" as any object that comes to a point, then this person can get corrected the moment s/he calls a knife a pencil. But if this person only ever happens to use that term in class, where the only pointed objects happen to be pencils, then how would anyone ever know that this person is talking about an entirely different thing? The line between object, sense and language is blurred, and necessarily so. To this end, it may not hurt to read Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument. Yes, you asked about Berkeley, and I pointed to Wittgenstein :) 

As for mathematics, Pythagoras was influential, but Euclid may be a better read as he's been taken as a model of logic by many. In fact, he influenced the structure of Spinoza's "Ethics" centuries later. As for the books you list, yes can read them all without a foundation in philosophy. You might run into a technical term here or there, and should be careful about terms whose philosophical meaning differs slightly from the common meaning (e.g.: form, idea, impression). 

Short Answer: Yes. Long Answer: Although ideally, all arguments should be evaluated on their merits, we often don't have the resources or know-how to do this. Therefore, we do rely on "fallacies" as a way saving ourselves some work. As such, people who appear to not be serious (or have a reputation for trolling) are subject to an ad hominem dismissal, respected authorities are often taken at face value, and so on. Unfortunately, rigor isn't always practical, especially for the layperson. For instance, if I were asked to make a mathematical or physical argument, I'd start off taking some things for granted -- be they the consensus opinions of experts or even previously proven results (that I haven't validated myself). Likewise, I wouldn't likely engage anyone who I think is trolling or is part of the "lunatic fringe". I'd know I'm committing a fallacy by doing so, yet this wouldn't deter me one bit. 

It sounds like he's begging the question. He's assuming the existence of the external world to prove the external world. If one assumes nothing beyond appearances, then the existence of objects that behave like me simply mean there are appearances of objects behaving like me. Nothing in the appearances implies that these objects have a subjective inner state like I do. Assuming anything beyond appearances is an inference. Views that deny the external world (like solipsism) aren't the least bit challenged by his argument. In fact, denying the external world is the kind of position that seems immune from any kind of refutation, for the simple fact that it "absorbs" everything, including arguments that it's not true. 

(1) is there any such thing as metaphysics? Some philosophers reject metaphysics or at least the attempt to talk about it. Hume, Carnap, Ayer and Wittgenstein all fall into this camp. Among those who think metaphysics exists or that we can talk about it, how many think (2) is plausible? This depends on how they view human experience. Those who hold that humans are material beings in a material reality would say that our experience arises from material interactions. This would seem to rule out metaphysical experiences which would require "stepping outside" of material reality to see the foundations. What if instead of experiencing the metaphysical, you infer it? Well logic is a symbolic, well structured process that proceeds from agreed-upon premises via well-defined rules to conclusions. By definition, this process can be communicated, and is communicated every day. Ok, well what if you hold (1) and (2), how does (3) fare? Now we're into speculative territory. I doubt (3) would hold as your experience would likely be ineffable. Ineffability is a big problem. To see what a challenge it is, imagine trying to explain the color red to someone who is blind from birth. When I tell someone that a dish was salty, I can only say this because I assume they have experienced saltiness and thus can attach their experience to that label. However, that label does nothing to communicate the experience itself. In short, language only works because there's a shared base of experience we can draw upon, which allows us to bypass the ineffability problem. With (3) you wouldn't have this common ground. At this point, you might have to take a page out of the mystics' playbook and try to explain by analogies or get people to experience what you experienced. 

They reserved these rights for humans and called those they wished to enslave "subhuman". Humans do this all the time; they manage to maintain contradictory positions by creating distinctions specifically to allow these sorts of loopholes. We can't blame philosophy for this, but philosophy does have a long tradition of trying to define humans, and has relied on things like "the rational principle" in the past. This makes it easier to deny human status to certain groups, since they use non-biological criteria to define humanity.
