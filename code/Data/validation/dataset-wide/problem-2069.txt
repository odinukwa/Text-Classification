If you like, can you even extend it into mentioning something about how good performance will be rewarded at annual review any the like, especially if the asked salary is at the low end of your range. That way if an employee later finds out they could have asked more, they can justify asking for a larger raise at review time - they were an unknown at the time after all, and now they aren't. And then at that point, having gotten out of the way that the company wasn't planning on countering (and why) you can then proceed to tell the employee what you just implied, namely, that you are offering them the amount they asked for. Of course that does not mean you have to pay what they ask if the amount they are asking is in the not in the range you are willing to pay (whether for budget reasons, or whatever). But if they are asking for more than that range it provides a nice segway into telling them what your best offer is. 

From what you have said, the truth is something that would hurt your reputation because it is something with a socially bad connotation. For instance, you got into a fist fight with somebody and got punched, and revealing this will likely cause your co-workers to think you are violent, unstable, keep poor company, or make poor choices. If this is the case, I would suggest something slightly different from the other answers. Tell them something that is socially innocuous, yet so embarrassing or humiliating that they won't believe it could be a lie. I mean, nobody would willingly make themselves look bad, right? For example, you might say that you ate something that disagreed with you the night before, and in trying to rush to the toilet to vomit you tripped and landed your face squarely against a wall coat rack, and the blinding pain caused you to throw up all over your favorite jacket which you now have to get dry cleaned. Or maybe you just installed a new coat rack in your closet, and thinking you were more handy than you really are you didn't realize it was installed across the pathway until you stood up to examine your handiwork only to plow straight into it with your head. Whatever you choose, just find something that is believable, but also make you look bad in a socially innocuous, "silly me" or "it could happen to anybody" way, and furthermore involves something like sickness or other personal body functions which aren't offensive but people don't like to talk about in order to avert further attention or questioning. 

You should give a standard 2-week notice, and leave it at that. You may just get lucky and they'll immediately escort you out and pay you anyway, freeing you to take Job 2. You may think your industry is huge, but don't burn bridges unless you have good reason too. At the end of the day, this is "you", so don't ruin your reputation over two weeks. 

It could be a trap Realize here there is a chance you've been already caught in the Honeypot, and if you don't report this, you may still have to answer tough questions like why you opened the file. Infosec loves to do things like this, whether dropping a CD in an open area with "Salaries" written on it, or perhaps in this case leaving a document in an easy to find place. The idea around the honeypot is you see something desirable, and then do something you shouldn't (Opening this file). This is a huge weakness for companies, because you can easily be socially engineered to give away your password and cause your company to come under attack. In your specific case, this may well not be a trap seeing that you saw actual salary information, but you should be forewarned that not everything is as it seems. 

This is a work culture you are not likely to overcome, and even if you do manage to work remotely, you may still be unhappy. For six years, I worked remotely 2 days a week at a company that discouraged working from home except when it was needed. How? I negotiated this up front when I was hired and they were desperate, and later when they tried to take it away, I let them know (nicely) that I'd probably be looking for another job if they pulled back this benefit. They never questioned me again about it. Perhaps the same hard-nosed attitude will work in your case. I have since switched jobs to a company that openly allows working remotely a few days a week so long as you get your work done. I can certainly say, this is a welcome relief to be in a "work-from-home" culture, than going against the culture like the first job I talked about. At my first job, you were lucky to get a conference line number to call into for meetings, usually you had to track someone down to start it up after the meeting started. At my new job every invite at my current company contains details on the conference call. We don't use our conference rooms much at work, most people would rather just talk at their desks unless we have to whiteboard. To sum it all up, If you want to work from home on a regular schedule, you will enjoy it much better under a new company that has the internal culture to support it. 

If the situation is that you have an end of employment date set up ahead of time but you're expected to keep working in the meantime, THEN it could be a breach of contract to reveal that you're being laid off. So definitely don't say anything in that case. So that's the part of my answer that's new, below is the rest of my answer in the form of rebuttals to existing answers. "No. They were not "your" clients, but rather clients of your former employer." The company I work for exclusively does contract work for other companies. The way that our contracts work, we are employees of the company where our offices are (the company I would casually say I work for), but also legally employees of the clients whose projects we work on. So, in a very real and LEGAL sense, my clients are my clients. We have no way of knowing the legal circumstances of the OP's situation, so the above assertion is baseless. "Attempting to contact those clients yourself, if your former employer got wind of it, could be construed as you attempting to steal business from your former employer or use that connection to get a job with them which might violate a contract or other agreement you signed." I work in the US, so of course this may be different where you are, but here any such non-compete clauses are generally a joke. They have never held up in court. The legal basis for this is that once you are laid off or quit, you are no longer under contract with that employer. And no matter how your employer tries to construe the language of your work contract, one of the most fundamental aspects of contract law is that any involved party can back out of the contract at any time. Your former employer can claim that the contract covers say, a one year period after you leave the company, during which time you can't work for their competitors. You of course can then say, "Well I'm backing out of the contract now, so too bad for you." "Don't actively try to steal the client. Besides possible restrictions in contracts, it's not really the ethical thing to do." Since I've already covered the contract aspect, let's look at the ethical concerns. You and that company were engaged in a mutually beneficial working relationship. That relationship has ended. Your former employer is not a human being with whom you are still friends. Ethically speaking you own your former employer NOTHING, just as they owe you nothing after you leave. I don't like that people keep using the word "steal" here, as that is literally not applicable. The client isn't a small physical object you can sneakily slip into your pocket and walk away with. It is literally not possible to steal one of your former employer's clients. What you CAN potentially do is engage that client in a risk/reward discussion with regards to hiring/contracting you to work for their company. But that is no different from any other person trying to get a job. That's just how the process works. 

I would report him, and encourage others to do the same. The best case for you here is for HR to understand how volatile he has become and dismiss him immediately before his notice is up. HR may not care much about what he is saying, but they certainly should care how this is affecting the morale of other employees. 

If you tell yourself you can't do this, then I guarantee your results will be exactly that. However, if you dive head first in these projects, setting up expectations with your boss that you are learning, and may not be able to deliver on time, that will give you the time to learn the right way to do these advanced technologies. As you are learning, check your assumptions with the experts on Stack Overflow. Get some code reviews internally if possible, and if that isn't an option there are other stack exchange sites for those. You can learn this stuff, yes you will make some mistakes, but that is how we get better. I say all this to say, take the bull by the horns and be happy for the challenge! Just some advice from a developer with 20 years experience 

You are on an uphill swim on this one. For six years, I worked remotely 2 days a week at a company that discouraged working from home except when it was needed. How? I negotiated this up front when I was hired and they were desperate, and later when they tried to take it away, I let them know (nicely) that I'd probably be looking for another job if they pulled back this benefit. They never questioned me again about it. Perhaps the same hard-nosed attitude will work in your case. I have since switched jobs, and I can say, it's so much nicer to work in a "work-from-home" culture, than going against the flow like the first job I talked about. 

*edit: "The only thing this doesn't cover is burning your bridges. It could be a very real disadvantage to piss off your former employer or coworkers." â€“ Tim Seguine I feel like Tim raised a good point in so far as I should have addressed this. I'd like to try to do that now, but I've been finding it difficult to express what feels very self-evident to me. So first let me re-iterate what I said before that you DEFINITELY should NOT reveal to your client that you're being laid off before your company does. You're still under contract and most likely there's privacy clauses, and it would just be asking for trouble. But assuming you wait until after your company makes the announcement, and assuming that you will wait until after you've left the company to make your good byes IF the situation plays out that way... then I couldn't come up with any plausible scenario where you're burning any bridges or pissing people off. So as much as I'd like to cover this "issue" it seems unrealistic to me. It may just be the combination of the country I live in and the industry in which I work. Maybe non-compete clauses are a big deal where you live. Maybe your company has a long dark history of suing former employees for "violating" non-competes. If you know that to be a fact, then I guess you have to decide for yourself how you feel about that. But let me paint a picture for you one last time. Your company is laying you off. However, the word "company" is just a label we use identify a group of people working together under some government charter, blah blah blah. The point is that there were actual people involved in the decision to lay you off. Your direct supervisor, plus probably your supervisor's manager, plus a couple of HR reps, plus who knows who else. Unless your company is very small, there was a whole chain people involved in making this decision. Those people are the ones who might be pissed off if you were to go work directly for their client. Do you think that THEY were concerned that laying you off was "burning bridges"? Those people got together and decided that the best decision for their organization as a whole, was to kick you out of it. Are you really going to concern yourself with how those people feel about YOUR CAREER after you leave?
