rrirower commented that there is no perfect plan since much depends on individuality. This is true, but tuning a plan requires plenty of experience with one's own strengths and weaknesses, with training in general, and a knowledge of the theory behind programming. Instead of doing some homebrew program without really knowing if it would benefit you, it would be better to go with one of the beginner programs that are highly popular, because they tend to be so for a reason. Good choices for 3 workouts per week would be Starting Strength, or StrongLifts 5x5. A good choice for 4 workouts per week that I have (positive) experience with is Johnny Candito's linear program. There are 3 variations for a focus on form, explosive power or hypertrophy. Some problems I see with your program is only training your lower body once per week, which neglects a lot of development potential. In the worst case this infrequent stimulus would not be sufficient to drive the adaptation needed for linear progression. In the best case it's a lot slower than it could be. Also, as Noshii mentioned, triceps might be better to combine with chest and biceps with back, since you tend to use triceps on chest exercises (like the bench press) and biceps on back exercises (like rows and pull-ups). It's also more convenient from a warm-up perspective. However, if at least 48 hours are allowed for recovery between workouts you could mix it up the way you did. Rather than take a wild guess at what might be optimal, rely on the experience of professionals out there and follow a well-designed program for novices. You'll find a large set of reviews for programs in this link: $URL$ This is with regard to how well they would benefit a powerlifter, but you should find some useful information regardless of your goals. If multiple programs seem suitable and you're wondering which one to choose, go for practical considerations: does it look like you would enjoy the exercises, does the program's layout appeal to you and is it feasible for you to follow it? For example, if you don't care that much about explosive power because you don't need it for some particular sport, and your gym is highly unsuitable for olympic lifts, maybe avoid programs involving them. 

Basically, if it's not getting worse, you don't notice anything else that's off, there's no persistent pain or anything that wouldn't be expected from exerting yourself, you can probably just ignore it. Some people will do reps until they feel "the burn", a burning sensation in the muscles. It's possible you're feeling a form of that. Even if not, if folks think it's alright to feel that I hardly see a problem with minor paresthesia provided it's not coupled with cramping or loss of strength in the extremities (like no longer being able to form a clenched fist). This "burn" is commonly and tragically attributed to lactic acid, which is unfortunately a misunderstanding that is now so entrenched I'm not sure we'll ever see the end of it. What gets actually produced is lactate, which gets lumped together with lactic acid even in the darn Wikipedia article about it at this time, and the lactate might not even be the cause of the burning sensation. But that too is not a problem. 

So, eh, kind of listed your whole lunch there. I think you'd be better of eating a salad with a lean source of protein like roasted chicken breast or shrimps. Or at least lower the amount of cashews, sunflower seeds and raisins, and find out the nutritional values of that ranch dressing. See if there's a lower-calorie option. A "light" variant isn't always great because often what they take out in fat they partially replace with sugar (taste gotta come from somewhere) and if anything I'd say you're worse of with that. 

It is going to depend on a number of factors. By how big the excess of carbohydrates was, exercise, how long prior to that you were actually in ketosis and protein consumption. Upon depletion of glucose and glycogen, the body will first attempt to create glucose from protein via gluconeogenesis. This is why protein consumption must also be moderated on a ketogenic diet. If protein intake is not sufficient for this, the tissue protein stores are protected by switching to ketone consumption in the brain, supplied by fat stores. If you resupply some carbohydrates and/or protein, you may exit ketosis. That will depend on the carbohydrate and protein consumption. Slam down a burger with a side of fries and a sugared soft drink and you'll likely have enough glucose to fuel the muscles and signal your body that the brain can switch back to glucose consumption. So yes, one meal can definitely break ketosis if it is high in carbs. With a more limited amount, it depends. If you've been in ketosis for some time, with glucose levels low and glycogen strongly depleted, then eat 50 grams of carbs, chances are there's not much impact. Even if you were to get out of ketosis, it won't be long before blood glucose levels are so low again that the body has to switch back to ketosis. If you get any keto flu at that point it will likely be less profound, or at least shorter, than before. If you ate some excess carbs and then shortly after that went for a workout, whether it was endurance sport or strength training, you'll have used up the glucose very quickly, meaning its impact may have been almost negligible. Your blood glucose level and insulin level would have increased temporarily, but ketosis is moderated not only by a low insulin level but also by a high glucagon level, and breakdown of fatty acids is also promoted by epinephrine (adrenalin) which exercise increases. Don't go eating extremely low protein in conjunction with low carbs to make up for the fluke meal, though, because protecting your muscle protein stores is important, and ketosis is also induced as a result of high gluconeogenesis. Just go back to what you did before. If you'd like to take the guess work out of it, you can by some ketosticks which can detect levels of ketone bodies via urine (not sure if that's directly or indirectly via waste products). They can give feedback on your ketosis state in various contexts, so you'll get a better feeling of how your body responds to what you do. 

While once considered essential in bodybuilding, the importance of nutrient timing has been severely downplayed in the last few years since plenty of studies fail to show significant results and the anabolic window of increased muscle protein synthesis is quite a lot longer than used to be thought. As in, it won't matter that much whether you take your protein shake immediately after training or several hours after. So when taking whey protein, options roughly fall within these categories: 

Cardio or weightlifting? For weightlifting, there's a ton of programs out there. Which ones are suitable depends on your goal and whether you're a novice or intermediate. Unless you are accustomed to this volume, there's no need to work out 5 days per week. 3 or 4 days could get the job done just fine and would allow for better recovery. If you are going to work out 5 times a week AND you are not adapted to such volume, start the workouts light. Try to get each muscle group in twice a week. For cardio, the same goes. Don't go overboard on volume unless you've built up the tolerance to it, and even then it's still a good idea to respect recovery. Cumulative fatigue can get the better of you. 5 moderate workouts per week could work well though, if it's more manageable than 4 or 3 more intense ones for you. 

You could load up the bar on the Smith machine, put it on your traps like with squats (never directly on the cervical spine!) and do them like that. A wooden board, plates or step plate can be used to put the balls of your feet on to reach proper depth. However, at 180 kg you may find that the load on the spine and whole upper body could be too much. Another option are seated calf raises. Again, these can be done in the Smith machine (at least that way it's good for something). Set up a bench in front of it, set the bar at a height where your legs, when seated, fit just under it, have the bar close to the knees (but still well on the upper legs) and push it up by contracting the calves. If there's a bar pad available, this could make it less uncomfortable. Note that different exercises are said to put emphasis on different muscles. Standing calf raises apparently stress the gastrocnemius most (the outermost calf muscles that are visible and have two heads), while the seated variant, due to the knees being flexed (relaxing the gastrocnemius) puts more emphasis on the soleus, a deeper muscle layer. I'm not sure if it's broscience or not, but it seems to make some sense. In general, with the calf muscles being as strong as they are, any exercise not done on a machine feels difficult to load enough without something else in the body getting taxed too much. A barbell on the back could have to be loaded with a lot more weight than is used for squats, holding it would require a heavy deadlift and would really test your grip (or tendons, if using straps) and using dumbbells just seems like it would never add enough weight past a certain point. Then again, if you can handle it in a shoulder-loaded standing calf press, a barbell or smith machine could work. Unless you have a specific calf press or seated calf raise machine, I'd suggest you stick with the standing calf raise machine available to you, discomfort and all, and maybe using a Smith machine or barbell in a rack for seated calf raises.
