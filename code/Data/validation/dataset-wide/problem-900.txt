In The Civil War: a Narrative, Shelby Foote periodically uses the phrase "airline miles" to mean "distance on a straight line." I can't recall offhand hearing this phrase anywhere else; why this phrase? Commercial air travel was still fairly new then. The first volume was published in 1958, the same year as the introduction of the Boeing 707, which was the first commercially successful passenger jet. Was that an influence at all? 

Very related: Why does the Emperor-Over-the-Sea play such a small role in the Chronicles of Narnia? Also related: Why is the Emperor Beyond the Sea named that? The Chronicles of Narnia refer to Aslan's father as "the Emperor beyond the Sea." He is never shown to act in Narnia directly, beyond creating the Deep Magic. Aslan created Narnia and is the only one seen directly acting in it. Are the Chronicles effectively endorsing deism here? 

The Appian Way was a major Roman Road. The Road to Damascus was presumably referring to the Apostle Paul's conversion experience, and presumably the "bitten apple" is referring to the fall of Adam and Eve (hence the "long road out of Eden"). Was Caesar selected because he represented imperialist empire-building? If so, is this song primarily "about" imperialism and war, or is it talking about imperialism more in the context of overall American materialism and "cultural junk"? One more factor to consider: the very next song is "I Dreamed There Was No War." I highly doubt that this placement was coincidental. Also, what's the significance of Mandalay? 

Mallory himself indicated that him and Toohey had never met in person, he knew none of Toohey's friends, and that he didn't think that Toohey had anything to do with him losing the commission (which was perfectly true). The main connection was that Toohey had criticized him in his column at one point. That being the case, why were Toohey and Keating so frightened by the Mallory's action? 

When a theater troupe visits Hamlet's castle, he makes some... rather pointed changes to their show, which now includes a murder much like the one his uncle performed. Why didn't anyone else (especially his uncle) figure out (or, at least suspect) such an obvious ploy? And why didn't anyone find Claudius's bizarre reaction to the addition suspicious? 

Obviously, Francisco knew that Ellis Wyatt would presumably join the Strike (which he did). With that said, though, in what sense did he consider this amusing? 

Jim Taggart periodically refers to the Orren Boyle as a "fat slob." Granted, Orren Boyle was notoriously inept, doesn't appear to actually produce all that much steel (and what little he produces appears to go mostly to those with political pull), and routinely failed to deliver on orders, but it's not like Jim was about to admit that. (In fact, he refused to cancel an order of steel with Associated Steel even after it was months late and Orren Boyle had nothing to offer but excuses for why it wasn't really his fault). Why does Jim consider Orren Boyle a "slob?" 

Also, many of the Looters themselves (like Jim Taggart) had finally realized the truth (or, like Orren Boyle, had been incapacitated and/or bankrupted). There's also a strong possibility that some of the Looters died in the aftermath of the bridge collapse; for example, it's strongly implied that Hank Rearden's family may well have starved to death. (This is as opposed to, for example, the Looters and the people who formed armed and apparently at least somewhat self-sufficient camps after John Galt's speech, who presumably would've been preserved from that kind of a fate). 

I'll withhold judgment on whether that theory is true or not, but if it is, that would strongly suggest that C. S. Lewis didn't intend to continue the series. It seems likely, though, that if he intended to write about other universes, he most likely would've just published them as a separate book (rather than trying to expand the Chronicles of Narnia series, which was always intended to be primarily about Narnia). 

When Hank Reardon and Dagny Taggart searched the abandoned 20th Century Motor Company, they found the prototype of John Galt's motor along with some documents describing it. However, the documents related to it were incomplete, missing what Robert Standler and some other characters described as the most important parts (e.g. John Galt's definition of energy and some other basic facts). John Galt later told Dagny that he left the prototype there because it was their rightful property, given that they had paid him to develop it. He also wasn't too concerned that they'd actually use it. What about the manual? It seems odd that a lot of the manual was there, but it was only missing the most important parts. For example, if someone used the missing pages as fuel for a fire or something like that (like a lot of the other paper in the plant was), wouldn't they have just burned the whole thing? Why bother using only a few pages? Did John Galt (or William Hastings, John Galt's boss who later joined the Strike) remove the most important pieces? If so, why didn't they regard the manual as the new owners' property, too? If they didn't remove it, why did John Galt and William Hastings risk someone reading the documents and learning the secret of the motor? 

How did he know that? He merely vaguely states that he "sees all things." Most of the other things the sphere describes would be easy to learn if you really were 3D (rather than flat), but this is an obvious exception. 

Loosely related: Are there two separate narrators in "On Most Surfaces" by The Gathering? The song On Most Surfaces by The Gathering (on their Nighttime Birds album) has the following lyrics: 

Is the sealed letter that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern carry that orders Hamlet's execution a deliberate reference to the Biblical King David having Uriah the Hittite carry a letter to Joab ordering his death? 

The Swamp of Sadness apparently had no effect on Atreyu, which Artax thought was likely due to him wearing the Amulet. That being the case, he's later obliged to consciously resist the paralyzing effect of Morla's eyes. Why did Morla's eyes have an effect when the Swamp didn't? 

Very closely related (on Science Fiction SE): Why did the wizarding society seem to have such a weak view of civil rights? Following the answers there, people that were sent to prison without trials (e.g. Hagrid, who was sent to prison without even having been charged with anything "as a precaution," or Sirius Black, who at least had clear charges against him even if he wasn't actually tried) "because of fear and political expediency," as the accepted answer on the linked question says. In the case of Hagrid, quite simply, the Ministry wants to be seen as doing something. The fact is they have no clue what the Monster of Slytherin was and they were completely powerless to stop it, but of course they couldn't/wouldn't actually admit that. Scrimgeour was quite explicit about this when discussing the case of Stan Shunpike with Harry: 

In the beginning of the book, when Eddie Willars confronted Jim Taggart about the poor condition of the Rio Norte Line, they had the following exchange: 

Full disclosure: I haven't entirely finished the book yet, so I'm hoping that this isn't an obvious question. When the Sphere visited A Square, he was aware of A Square's dream about Lineland and seemed familiar with its content. The Sphere stated: 

First, the story makes it quite clear that their "friendship" isn't genuine. Given that Atlas Shrugged is explicitly formulated in Aristotelian terms (even its 3 parts are named after the 3 laws of logic, which were originally investigated by Aristotle), you could argue that their friendship is, in one sense, a "utilitarian friendship," which Aristotle viewed as the "lowest level" of friendship - it doesn't necessarily involve genuine liking, and isn't necessarily based on virtue (which both of them lacked anyway). The sole basis for their relationship is the fact that they're useful to each other in some sense. Another defining characteristic of looters was their refusal to truly acknowledge or appreciate the ways in which people are useful to them - for example, they were completely indifferent to Hank Rearden even while they benefited from his metal. Even when they gave a banquet solely in his honor, Hank remarked to Dagney that they didn't truly care about acknowledging him or his accomplishments and they were still indifferent to his metal (much to his frustration - he hoped that the banquet at least reflected them being "gracious losers" in some sense, but it wasn't even that). They went through the motions of honoring him and holding the banquet because they had some sense that that's what you do in situations like that. This is why you can have the doublethink of having a utility-based relationship while refusing to truly acknowledge the nature of that relationship or even the fact that the other person was useful to them. Also, the utility was the fact that they helped each other in their lack of virtue - for example, Orren Boyle helped ram through the anti-dog-eat-dog rule, which everyone knew was explicitly designed to destroy Dan Conway. In short, their friendship was utilitarian, but they didn't truly acknowledge the other person's usefulness to them, and even this "utility" was just enabling their lack of virtue. Given that the existence of this doublethink, it's hardly surprising that their "friendship" was also defined by some degree of treachery, back-stabbing, and mutual disloyalty. After all, that's the entire basis of their relationship to begin with. Orren Boyle is useful to Jim in the beginning of the novel primarily because he helped him stab Dan Conway in the back. The fact that he called Boyle a "fat slob" in particular was likely due to the fact that, quite bluntly, he was a fat slob (although it is still somewhat curious that Jim acknowledges that fact). He was notoriously inept, and in spite of having steel plants that were far larger than even Hank Rearden's plants (Associated Steel had 60 open-hearth furnaces vs. Rearden's 20) he never seems to get around to actually producing much steel. (A third of his furnaces were completely idle, and the rest of them were producing 300 tons of steel per furnace per day, compared with Hank Rearden who was producing an average of 750 tons of steel per furnace). He routinely misses deadlines for orders and has nothing but excuses for why he "couldn't help it." Even when he does ship stuff, it's often of inferior quality; in at least one incident, defective steel girders his company shipped caused a building collapse, killing several workers. (Ironically, he also made steel track that was evidently far heavier than was actually required for safety and durability). Possibly more to the point, Jim recognizes Boyle's treachery and back-stabbing - for example, he calls Boyle a "fat slob" in reference to the fact that Boyle was evidently trying to sabotage the building of the John Galt Line ("if that fat slob thinks he can..."). 

Three of the most important reasons appear to be a) the fact that he was dead b) the fact that most of the bureaucrats evidently hadn't heard of him (based on the fact that CID men come looking for him) and c) the fact that he was a major literary figure. Point a) is important to the irony - if Major Major signs his name with the name of a living person, it comes back for him to sign again. If he signs it with the name of a dead person, it doesn't come back. To some extent, it also likely symbolizes the soul-crushing effects of the bureaucracy. Yossarian and Major Major are simply taking the next logical step of signing their name as someone who's already dead. This is actually kind of like the running gag with T. S. Eliot that Ex-PFC Wintergreen started. 

In The Last Battle, Emeth was a soldier from Calormene who worshiped Tash. Apparently, he thought that Tash was basically like Aslan, so Aslan interpreted Emeth's worship of Tash as actually being worship of him. Aslan tells Emeth in chapter 15 that "I take to me the services which thou hast done to Tash... if any man swear by him and keep his oath for the oath's sake, it is by me that he has truly sworn, though he know it not, and it is I who reward him." Obviously, Emeth ends up going to Aslan's Country. What's the theological significance/basis of this? How did this reflect C. S. Lewis's broader views on salvation? Does Lewis think that sincerity is "enough" for salvation? 

This sounds at least superficially like the Wood between the worlds in The Magician's Nephew. With that said, there are some significant differences (such as the fact that you don't enter world through visible pools of water, the fact that it doesn't instantly make you "sleepy" and forget what you were doing, and the absence of Rings or other similar devices). Was this an intentional parallel (the differences notwithstanding)? 

Is Don Henley implicitly categorizing himself (or, at least, the narrator of the song) as a "Cadillac owner" (minus the Deadhead sticker)? Is the narrator a former "deadhead sticker" type who became a "Cadillac owner" type, warning himself that he's no longer a "deadhead" type?
