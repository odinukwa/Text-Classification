View from Skierffe toward Námmasj. The boat will drop you off at the bottom of Námmasj, so if you want to enjoy the view from Skierffe, do that as a day trip from Aktse before setting off into the Sarek wilderness. 

The day before our car broke down (the road in the picture is much busier than the road where our car broke down). Good advice: 

Down sleeping bags and down jackets should not be stored in the stuffbag, but as loose as possible. Tents, as far as I know, can be stored stuffed as long as they are dry. Are there any other materials or equipment that I should be aware of that should not be stored in the same bag as when I'm carrying it on my backpack? 

What you need is quite individual and the best way to tell what works for you is from your own experience. Some ultralight backpackers use backpacks that I would personally consider impossibly light and small (in particular in the USA), but they may be happy to lie under a thin single-layer sheet even in bad weather. Others prefer to carry a bit more for comfort and (perceived or real) safety. It depends on the climate too. Try with a 65 litre backpack. Those are very common. If it seems tight for a 7-day trip, get something larger for your 14-day trip. If it seems too large for a 7-day trip, then it may be good enough for your 14-day trip. Etc. 

I will have a work trip in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada early June, and I'm seeing if I can combine this with a backpacking trip in the nearby coast mountains for 2–3 nights. However, it's very early in the season and from the presence of big glaciers I deduce the Coast Mountains are very snowy, so I expect alpine routes in e.g. Garibaldi Provincial Park will be inaccessible due to deep snow, perhaps down into the forest. What are some backpacking trails in the area, that are accessible in the spring/summer shoulder season (early June)? As I have only 2–3 days, I don't want to be more than 2–3 hours of travel from either Whistler or Vancouver. I prioritise solitude over having the most spectacular scenery. 

I am investigating the feasibility of a hike looping around Hofsjökull. This will take me through several “deserts” such as Hofsafrétt and Sprengisandur. On photos, this looks pretty dry, but Iceland is not the Sahara. 

I'll have the good part of a Saturday to enjoy in Boulder, Colorado on 18 May. What is a suitable area for a day, loop hike close to the city? My criterion for "close" is that the start of the trail can be reached with at most 30 minutes cycling or a short bus ride. By a "day hike" I mean around 5–6 hours not counting breaks. By "loop" I mean that it ends where it starts, not necessarily that no part of the trail is walked twice. I've found a handful of hikes at Wikiloc and quite many at OSMP, but most hikes appear quite short, less than 6–7 km. Via wikiloc I find one hike between 5 and 10 mi in length, but this is not a loop so poses logistic issues. Is there any other place where I can filter hikes near Boulder by length and 'loop vs line'? 

Start by day hikes where you can frequently exit. For example, find a day hike where after 2 hours, one has the option either to cut it short to a 2½ hour hike in total, or to extend it to 4 hours, and after 4 hours, one has again the option to cut it to 4½ hours, or to make it 6 hours. If you've done this for several days and find out that 6 hour day hikes are fine for you, you can start doing hikes reaching more remote places where you don't have such an "exit strategy". Make such hikes for several days. If this goes fine too, you can start planning multi-day hikes. Again, start easily: do hikes where you have an exit strategy. Hike from cabin to cabin, where one can decide each day to stop the next day, or to continue for at least one more day. In summary, when unexperienced, I recommend to build flexibility into your planning. Some unexperienced hikers have no problem hiking a week on stretch. Others find within 2 hours that they have had enough for the day. The only way to find out is to try it out; take it easy, and have an exit strategy. 

Tarhalshytta on Sørøya, with the Barents Sea For Statskog I have found an overview of open huts here [PDF], but that's only one of the agencies. Is there any resource on the web that collects — perhaps by users contributing — an overview of such freely available huts? 

Swimming is a popular summer pas-time in Sweden and Finland. In rural areas, it's still common for schools to have swimming lessons outside, in lakes. I'm pretty sure there's no risk from fauna in Swedish lakes. If you go too far north, you could risk hypothermia ;). 

Outdoor instructions in Lapland often recommend to always use a wading staff for river crossings, and not a trekking pole. Ever since I purchased my Folding Wading Staff in a Swedish outdoor store, I don't understand how I ever did without. Trekking poles are not designed to sustain the weight of hiker+backpack leaning on it in strong flow, and I wouldn't want a trekking pole to collapse under heavy weight in the middle of a fast-flowing river crossing. Outside Scandinavia, I don't even see wading staffs for sale in outdoor stores. Google Search in English yields returns for fishing stores, but not hiking, as if the only context to cross a river is when fishing. How do people cross fast-flowing rivers without a dedicated wading staff? 

Usually, the two categories don't change. The only item that changes is the items I need for fording rivers, as I'm sometimes quite sure that I won't need to ford any; although I've been wrong there at times. I do not put my things in plastic bags¹. I used to, but for optimal packing efficiency, it is much better to pack everything separately as much as possible; 10 packages of hard tack can be stuffed into otherwise empty corners (nature abhors a vacuum!) much better than a plastic bag with 10 packages of hard tack.. In practice, this means I use my food (packages of hard tacks, dried meals, breakfast food) to fill the areas that remain unused after packing bulky items like my sleeping bag and kitchen (those go near the bottom, as I don't cook for lunch). Overall, this works very well. In the evening then, when setting up camp, I open my backpack at the bottom — and immediately reach my tent, kitchen, sleeping bag, etc. Note that I have not hiked in bear country, so I might need to make some adaptations when I do. 

Source: Johann Dréo, CC-BY-SA, Wikimedia Commons A topographic map appears to show plenty of streams in this area, but so do maps in deserts in the USA, even if those streams rarely have water (usually shown dashed but sometimes also when drawn as continuous lines). Should I expect that streams to be seasonal and dried out in September, or can I rest assured that in the chilly climate of Iceland with little evaporation, streams do not actually dry out? 

I am considering to get Garcia Machine Backpacker's Cache. According to MEC user reviews, this is the only cache approved in the Adirondack Mountains. Canadian parks, and other places as well, contain instructions of how to hang your food bear-proof in a tree. Those drawings are always related to bear bags rather than bear canisters. If I am camping in an area with black bears and grizzly bears (but not polar bears!), do I still need to hang my cache in a tree, or is it sufficient to put it on the ground at a safe distance from my tent? 

I live in Sweden and I hike a lot in the wild. My personal top three properties to look for in a handheld GPS receiver for The Great Outdoors: 

Many bicycle panniers are made of waterproof material. Backpacks are not, necessitating built-in or separate raincovers. Why don't backpacks use the material that waterproof panniers do? Unlike gear to be worn on the body, there's no need for backpacks to breathe. 

Source: Wikimedia Commons. I've seen this in at least The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, Spain, Poland. Switzerland has its own, different system. Is there any such system in North America or parts thereof? Wikipedia doesn't really help here. 

This depends enormously on landscape, weather, and infrastructure. I grew up in The Netherlands several hundred meter from a motorway, but with good noise barriers, we heard almost nothing. My friend lives less than 100 metre from a noise-barriered motorway and it's nearly inaudible. Now I live several km from a motorway in England, without noise barriers. Depending on the weather, I either hear nothing at all or it's so annoying I can not stand being in my garden, and hear it even with the windows closed. I've been considering to buy a sound pressure level meter to compare my impression to something measurable and try to relate it to my circumstances. The quietest weather tends to be dense fog, when traffic is either crawling or stationary, both of which are sufficiently quiet several kms away. If there's a hill between you and the road, or if the road is underground, you will hear (nearly) nothing even very close. But if the road is in a valley and you're up on the slope, you might hear it many kms away. I've been 10 km from roads and still found some heavy powerful lorries going uphill disturbing, but that on a mostly open landscape with at most small sub-Arctic mountain birch forest type trees. In some countries there are interactive noise maps, such as this one for England. I found the value of this quite limited, as my personal experience is worse than this map claims for my area. It also depends on the road, of course. Some roads have traffic all night, others become completely quiet. Personally, my strategy if I'm near a road, is to seek out a sound I find pleasant rather than annoying: specifically, a stream or river. Those may drown out the road sound such that I can pretend to be in the wilderness rather than right next to a road. 

Cycling to work at -32°C. Photo by Torbjörn Lövgren. What kind of shoes can I wear to keep warm for different outdoor activities such as cycling, snowshoeing, skiing? It doesn't have to be a single shoe, although sometimes I combine activities (cycling to starting point), so it would be a plus if it were. 

I like to eat Knorr Spaghetteria. I don't know if it's the most efficient energy-wise, but it's vastly more efficient than outdoor store dehydrated meals price-wise! At Amazon they sell at €1.45 per package. A package is advertised to be a meal for two, but it isn't — it is a meal for one. But €1.45 per meal is not bad at all. I used to bring peanut butter, but I don't bother any more. I just bring peanuts. Lots and lots of them. Easier to carry, easier to eat. Apart from that, I eat hardkeks, dried fruits (mango, papaya, strawberry, and pineapple), chocolate, oatmeal with raisins ad sugar.
