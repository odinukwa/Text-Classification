Since I asked the question, I have come to realize that in my application, I know more about $X$ and the action of $G$. For this application, $X$ has finite quotient singularities as it is the coarse moduli space of a smooth DM stack and the action of $G$ comes from an action of the group on this stack in the sense Romagny's paper. Using this, I think I am able to show the desired conclusion. Let me sketch the proof here: Proposition Let $\mathcal{M}$ be an orbifold, that is a smooth separated Deligne-Mumford stack with connected coarse moduli space and containing a non-empty open substack which is a scheme. Let the smooth group scheme $G$ act on $\mathcal{M}$ with finite, reduced stabilizers at geometric points. Then the quotient $\mathcal{M}/G$ is again a smooth DM stack. Proof Consider the frame bundle $\mathcal{F} = \text{Fr}\left( T_\mathcal{M} \right)$ of the tangent bundle $T_\mathcal{M}$ of $\mathcal{M}$. We know $\mathcal{F}$ is an algebraic space and for $n=\dim(\mathcal{M})$, the group $\text{GL}_n$ acts on $\mathcal{F}$ on the right by $$ (v_1, \ldots, v_n) . (a_{ij})_{i,j=1}^n = (\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i1} v_i, \ldots, \sum_{i=1}^n a_{in} v_i) $$ and we have that $\mathcal{M} = [\mathcal{F}/\text{GL}_n]$. On the other hand, the action of $G$ on $\mathcal{M}$ induces an action of $G$ on $\mathcal{F}$ by $$ g . (v_1, \ldots, v_n) = (g_* v_1, \ldots, g_* v_n), $$ where $g_*$ denotes the pushforward under the map $p \mapsto gp$ on $\mathcal{M}$. One shows that both actions are strict actions on the stack $\mathcal{F}$ and that they commute (as pushforward is $\mathbb{C}$-linear) and hence induce an action $$G \times \text{GL}_n \times \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$$ with finite reduced stabilizers. With these preparations done, we simply note that $$\mathcal{M}/G = [\mathcal{F}/\text{GL}_n]/G = (\mathcal{F}/\text{GL}_n)/G = \mathcal{F}/(\text{GL}_n \times G).$$ The second isomorphism is a consequence of Theorem 4.1 and Remark 2.4 of Romagny's paper. But now $\mathcal{F}$ is a smooth algebraic space and the action of $G \times \text{GL}_n$ has finite, reduced stabilizers at geometric points, so the quotient $\mathcal{F}/(\text{GL}_n \times G)$ is again a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack. qed Hence instead of first taking the coarse moduli space $X$ of $\mathcal{M}$ and then performing the quotient, one can first take the quotient stack, which is smooth DM, and then take the coarse moduli space, which thus has finite quotient singularities. I don't know whether this can be used to answer the original question. In Proposition 2.8 of a paper by Vistoli it is shown that any normal complex variety with quotient singularities is the coarse moduli space of a smooth stack. However, to apply this to the question above one would need a way to lift the action of $G$ to a strict action on this stack. 

The result that you need is Luna's slice theorem. You find a discussion in this thread with references to these lecture notes by Drezet. To see that this is what you want, note that we have a reductive group action on a smooth, affine variety, so we are in the situation of Theorem 5.4 from the script. It says that there exists a locally closed subvariety $V$ of $X$ containing $x$ which is $G_x=G$-invariant (here we use $x$ is a fixed point). Moreover we have $$G \times_G V \cong V \xrightarrow{\psi} X$$ is strongly étale. In this case, it is of course only an inclusion of $V$ as an open set in $X$. The important thing is that we also have an étale G-equivariant morphism $\phi: V \to T_x X$ , sending $x$ to $0$ with $T \phi = \mathrm{id}_{T_x X}$. Its image $W \subset T_x X$ is open and saturated and satisfies that $\phi: V \to W$ is a strongly étale $G$-morphism. Looking up the definition, this means that the induced map $V // G \to W //G$ is étale. But $V$ was an open set of $X$ and $W$ an open set of $T_x X$, so $\phi$ induces the isomorphism of analytic germs of the quotient spaces $X//G$ and $T_x X//G$. 

Suppose we have a projective, nonsingular, convex variety $X$, $\beta \in H_2(X,\mathbb{Z})$ and a family $$ \begin{array}{ccc} \mathcal{C}& \to & X \cr \downarrow& & & \cr B & & \end{array}. $$ together with sections $\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_n: B \to \mathcal{C}$ making the diagram above a family of stable maps from $n$-pointed genus $g$ curves over $B$, inducing a map $B \to \overline M_{g,n}(X,\beta)$. Assume $B$ is a smooth curve and all fibres $\mathcal{C}_b$ are smooth except for one fibre over a point $0 \in B$ which is a curve with one node. Question: Is $\mathcal{C}$ being smooth a sufficient criterion for $B \to \overline M_{g,n}(X,\beta)$ being transverse to the boundary? If not, how could I try showing transversality (or computing the multiplicity of the intersection)? If this helps: I only need the answer for $g=0$ and $X=\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$. 

You might also want to have a look at a book about Hurwitz stacks by Bertin-Romagny called "Champs de Hurwitz". There they construct spaces $\mathcal{H}_{g,G,\xi}$ of smooth projective curves $C$ with an action of a finite group $G$ and specified fixed-point behaviour recorded in $\xi$. Since (I guess) automorphism groups in a family of curves jump in size on closed subsets of the base, you can construct a family as you desire by taking the open subset of $\mathcal{H}_{g,G,\xi}$ where the automorphism group of $C$ is exactly $G$. In a certain sense this is the universal such family. The dimension of the space $\mathcal{H}_{g,G,\xi}$ is exactly $3g'-3+b$ where $g'$ is the genus of the quotient curve $C/G$ and $b$ is the number of branch points. So just as Jason said, the space is positive-dimensional unless $g'=0$ and $n=3$. 

The following argument should answer the original question. However it still seems that the right way to do it is via the Artin stack of $n$-pointed, at-worst-nodal curves as proposed by Jason Starr. My argument why $\mathcal{C}$ being smooth suffices for obtaining transversality goes as follows: 

Let $G$ be a complex reductive algebraic group acting on a complex variety $X$ (not necessarily projective) with $\text{Pic}^G(X)$ finite dimensional (for simplicity). For a fixed $x \in X$ define $$P^s(x)=\{L \in \text{Pic}^G(X)_{\mathbb{Q}} : x \in X^s(L)\}$$ and $$P^{ss}(x)=\{L \in \text{Pic}^G(X)_{\mathbb{Q}} : x \in X^{ss}(L)\}.$$ Question: Is $P^s(x)$ open in $\text{Pic}^G(X)_{\mathbb{Q}}$ and is $P^{ss}(x)$ closed? For $X$ projective and when restricting to the cone of ample $G$-linearized divisors, this should be true by the Hilbert-Mumford numerical criterion. I would be happy for either a counter-example or for an affirmative answer (possibly with stronger conditions on $X$). 

I think indeed $f$ cannot have a pole or an essential singularity. The case $n=0$ cannot happen, so below say $n \geq 1$. If $f$ had a pole of order $k>0$, then $f(z)^n$ has a pole of order $kn$, whereas the remaining terms $\varphi_{n-1}(z)f(z)^{n-1}+ \ldots + \varphi_0(z)$ can have at most a pole of order $k(n-1)$, so they cannot cancel the pole of $f(z)^n$. Now assume $f$ has an essential singularity. By the Theorem of Casorati-Weierstrass, this is equivalent to requiring that the image of arbitrarily small punctured discs around $0$ is dense in $\mathbb{C}$. In other words for all $r,\epsilon>0$, $u \in \mathbb{C}$ there is $z$ with $0<|z|<r$ such that $|f(z)-u|<\epsilon$. The idea is that around $z=0$, the functions $\varphi_j$ are essentially constant, so the left hand side of the equality in your question essentially looks like plugging the function $f(z)$ into a polynomial of positive degree. Then since such a polynomial is surjective (as a function $\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$) and since the image of $f$ around $0$ is dense in $\mathbb{C}$, the image of the composition is still dense in $\mathbb{C}$, thus certainly not equal to $\{0\}$. If you want to make this precise, you need to play around with some $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ to make sure that the coefficient functions $\varphi_j$ are sufficiently close to their value at $z=0$. 

I guess my answer will be in the category of complex manifolds, therefore we definitely need to assume that $X$ is smooth. I am not that familiar with this language, so I apologize for any stupid mistakes coming from this. Assume that $D$ is simple normal crossing and that $Y$ is smooth. Denote by $X_0 = X \setminus D$, $X_1 = D \setminus \text{Sing}(D)$, and inductively $X_{k+1}$ is the non-singular part of $\text{Sing}(\overline{X_k})$. Then the sections of $\mathcal{T}_X(- \log D)$ are those holomorphic vector fields on $X$, which are tangent to all strata $X_k$. I think a sufficient criterion for surjectivity is: Y intersects all the strata $X_k$ transversally (in the sense $T_p Y + T_p X_k = T_p X$ for all $p \in Y \cap X_k$) Indeed, to check whether the morphism $i^* \mathcal{T}_X(- \log D) \to \mathcal{N}_{Y/X}$ of locally free sheaves on $Y$ is surjective, it suffices to check in the fibres. At a point $p \in Y \cap X_k$ the divisor $D$ has equation $z_1 z_2 \ldots z_k =0$ in local coordinates and a local basis of $\mathcal{T}_X(- \log D)$ is given by $$z_1 \frac{\partial}{\partial z_1}, \ldots, z_k \frac{\partial}{\partial z_k}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z_{k+1}} \ldots, \frac{\partial}{\partial z_{\dim X}}.$$ The assumption, that $Y$ intersects $X_k$ transversally means that $T_p Y$ together with $\frac{\partial}{\partial z_{k+1}}|_p \ldots, \frac{\partial}{\partial z_{\dim X}}|_p$ span the vector space $T_p X$, thus the sections $\frac{\partial}{\partial z_{k+1}} \ldots, \frac{\partial}{\partial z_{\dim X}}$ restrict to generators of the fibre of $\mathcal{N}_{Y/X}$ at $p$. If we drop the assumption that $Y$ is smooth, we might be able to phrase the transversality condition in terms of the matrix of derivatives of a regular sequence $x_1, \ldots, x_l$ defining $\iota$ along tangent directions to $X_k$ having rank $l$. [For this see also the discussion in the comments.] 

Let me collect two partial results that I learned since asking the question. I would still be very happy to have a more general answer of course. 1) For $G=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ the question can be explicitly answered (as described in the comments above). Indeed, combining Theorem 8.9 (case $i=0$) and Theorem 8.8 of the book Free Lie Algebras by Reutenauer, the multiplicity with which the representation $V_\lambda$ appears in $\mathrm{Ind}_{G}^{S_n} 1$ is the number of standard tableaux of shape $\lambda$ and major index congruent to $0$ mod $n$. For convenience, let me recall that in a standard tableau $T$, a descent is an index $i \in \{1, \ldots, n-1\}$ such that $i+1$ is in a lower row than $i$ in $T$ and the major index is the sum of all descents for $T$. 2) For general finite groups $G$, the only useful result I know is that the restriction of $\mathrm{Ind}_{G}^{S_n} 1$ to $S_{n-1}$ is isomorphic to the regular representation of $S_{n-1}$ by Mackey's formula. Indeed, note that since $G$ acts simply transitively on itself by left-translation, we have $S_n=G \cdot S_{n-1}$. Since any nontrivial element of $G$ has no fixed point as a permutation of $G$, we have $G \cap S_{n-1}=\{()\}$. Then by Mackey's formula $$\left(\mathrm{Ind}_{G}^{S_n} 1 \right)|_{S_{n-1}} = \mathrm{Ind}_{\{()\}}^{S_{n-1}}1 = \mathrm{Reg}_{S_{n-1}}.$$ Translated to partitions, this means the following: take all partitions $\lambda$ with the multiplicity in which $V_\lambda$ appears in $\mathrm{Ind}_{G}^{S_n} 1$. From this form the multiset of all partitions $\mu$ obtainable by removing a block of the partitions $\lambda$. Then the collection of $\mu$ obtained this way is the set of all partitions of $n-1$ with the multiplicity given by the dimension of $V_{\mu}$. In a certain sense this says that a lot of partitions $\lambda$ appear in $\mathrm{Ind}_{G}^{S_n} 1$. Indeed, any partition $\mu$ of $n-1$ must be obtainable from such a $\lambda$ by removing one block.
