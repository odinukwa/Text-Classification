The origin of $d^2 = 0$ is surely the geometry: think of a solid ball; it's boundary is a sphere, but the sphere has no boundary. More generally, "every boundary is a cycle". The first formulation of the simplicial complex theory used orientations in order to get "a boundary is a cycle" but this had problems for the singular theory. Then Eilenberg introduced the ordered theory, which led to simplicial sets, and more generally simplicial objects. It might be helpful to see why the Dold-Kan correspondence is true by looking at generalisations and variations. See section 7 of my survey paper "Groupoids and crossed objects in algebraic topology", Homology, homotopy and applications, 1 (1999) 1-78. 

I have found that a strong indicator of research ability is a student wanting to know why something is true. There is also an interesting distinction between an explanation and a proof. (I gave up using the word "proof" for first year students of analysis, and changed it to "explanation", a word they could understand. This was after a student complained I gave too many proofs!) A proof takes place in a certain conceptual landscape, and the clearer and better formed this is the easier it is to be sure the proof is right, rather than a complicated manipulation. So part of the work of a mathematician is to develop these landscapes: Grothendieck was a master of this! Of course the more professional a person is in an area the nearer an explanation comes to a rigorous proof. But in fact we do not write down all the details. It is more like giving directions to the station and not listing the cracks in the pavement, though warning of dangerous holes. The search for an explanation is also related to the search for a beautiful proof. So we should not neglect the aesthetic aspect. 

There is also a nice answer in the case of a group $G$ acting on a groupoid $\Gamma$. Taylor, J. Quotients of groupoids by the action of a group. Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 103 (1988) 239--249. One forms the composite $\Gamma \to \Gamma \rtimes G \to (\Gamma \rtimes G)/N$, where the second groupoid is the semidirect product and the first morphism is $\gamma \mapsto (\gamma,1)$; $N$ is the normal closure of all elements of the form $(0_x,g)$ for all $x \in Ob(\Gamma), g \in G$; and the second morphism is the quotient morphism. The theorem is that this composition is an orbit morphism, i.e. gives the quotient of $\Gamma$ by the action of $G$. (This normal closure is not usually a disjoint union of object groups.) This result is applied to calculate the fundamental groupoid of certain orbit spaces in Chapter 11 of my book "Topology and groupoids" (2006). For example it works for discontinuous actions of groups on a Hausdorff space which admits a universal cover (joint work with Philip Higgins, also in the 1988 differently titled edition of that book). For example it calculates the fundamental group of the symmetric square of a space. (A version of this work is in arXiv:math/0212271.) 

I quote from a recent article by Brown and Porter in the De Morgan Journal, published online by the LMS. $URL$ and commented on subsequently by David Wells. I feel the following idea needs advertising. "A technique widely used by psychologists and trainers is error-less learning. This falls into two types. One is where large hints, props, and supports to a specific course of action are given, and the action is rewarded as a symbol of success. Then the various props are gradually withdrawn. The other type uses reverse chaining: the easiest way to see to this is to think of encouraging a child to put on a vest. You do not throw him or her a vest and say put it on; instead, you put it almost on, and then ask the child to do the final action. Subsequently, you gradually put the vest less and less fully on, till the whole action can be done. One way of using the last technique in university mathematics is to write out a formal proof and then erase bits of it. The student has to fill in the bits, using clues from the rest of the proof. This has some analogies with the practice of a professional mathematician, who may have an idea and outline for a proof, but needs to work on details. The student also gets an idea of the structure of a proof. Such an exercise is also very easy to mark! The general feeling about error-less learning is that it works like a dream! In either method, the fact long verified by psychologists is used, that we learn from success. We can also learn to accommodate failure if that is gradually introduced, and strategies are available for dealing with failure." 

I have been reading Jacob Lurie's book "Higher Algebra", version May 8, 2011. One is grateful to him for covering such a lot of ground and for making it all so readily available. My attention was drawn to the Section A.3 on "The Seifert-van Kampen Theorem" p. 845. It starts by stating the classical theorem determining the fundamental group of pointed space which is a union of two open sets with path-connected intersection. (The most general theorem of this type is for the fundamental groupoid on a set $A$ of base points for a space $X$ which is the union of a family $\mathcal U$ of open sets and such that $A$ meets each path-component of all 1-,2-,3-fold intersections of the sets of $\mathcal U$). It states: " In this section, we will prove a generalization of the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which describes the entire weak homotopy type of $X$ in terms of any suﬃciently nice covering of X by open sets: Theorem A.3.1." However this Theorem makes no mention of groups or connectivity conditions. So my question is: How does one deduce the SvKT as stated there, or its more general version, from Theorem A.3.1? Theorem A.3.1 itself seems closely related to classical theorems on excision, showing the singular complex is chain homotopy equivalent to the singular complex of $\mathcal U$-small simplices. (I don't have the earliest reference for this, but I like the proof by R. Sch\"on from Proc. AMS 59 (1976).) A particular point for the deduction of the most general version of the SvKT is: why the number 3? One explanation is that it has to do with the Lebesgue dimension of $\mathbb R^2$. 

This is not an answer but I think points to a line of investigation. We know for a CW-complex $X$ that $X$ is the colimit of its skeleta $X^n$, and that $X^{n+1}$ is obtained from $X^n$ by attaching cells, which again is a colimit operation. I now refer to the general theory of fibred exponential laws, which have been investigated over many years by Peter Booth, also with colleagues at Memorial University, and we wrote two papers: (1) Spaces of partial maps, fibred mapping spaces and the compact-open topology, Gen. Top. Appl. 8 (1978) 181-195. (2) On the application of fibred mapping spaces to exponential laws for bundles, ex-spaces and other categories of maps, Gen. Top. Appl. (1978) 165-179. both available from my publications list as [26,27], and from the Journal's web page. These papers show that under suitable restrictions, or by working in a convenient category of spaces, see Section 7 of (1), and Section 8 of (2), that if $p:Y \to X$ is a map of spaces then the pullback functor $p^*: Top/X \to Top/Y$ has a right adjoint and so preserves colimits. So if $Y^n= p^{-1}X^n$ you get that $Y$ is the colimit of the $Y^n$. Now you also have a chance of analysing the construction of $Y^{n+1}$ from $Y^n$. I think this easily gives the case mentioned by Fernando, when $p$ is a covering: that result goes back to JHCW, with a direct proof. You need to look carefully at the pullbacks of the elements of the construction of $X^{n+1}$. Perhaps you also need to look at generalisations of CW-complexes. See for example Minian, G.; Ottina, M. A geometric decomposition of spaces into cells of different types. J. Homotopy Relat. Struct. 1 (2006) 245–271 and its sequel. 

I feel one should make a distinction between categories in their so-to-speak metamathematical role, for example in using results such as the Yoneda Lemma, or a left adjoint preserves colimits, and categories used as an algebraic structure with partial operations, in which guise I cite many examples of groupoids. One such example groupoid is the unit interval groupoid $\mathbf I$ with two objects $0,1$ and exactly one arrow between any objects. This groupoid plays a similar role in the category of groupoids to the integers in the category of groups. Also the integers are obtained from $\mathbf I$ by identifying $0,1$ in the category of groupoids: this is one explanation of why the fundamental group of the circle is the integers. That last comment is an application of the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem for the fundamental groupoid $\pi_1(X,A)$ on a set $A$ of base points, a theorem which is about calculating homotopy $1$-types of not necessarily connected spaces. It is quite necessary in using this theorem to keep all the information about the way various components of the pieces intersect; moving to equivalence will destroy that information. In the case of groupoids with structure, which may be a topology, or a smooth structure, or an algebraic structure (group, ring, Lie algebra,...) then the usual equivalence of a transitive groupoid to a group of course no longer applies to preservation of the extra structure. But there are simpler structures: for example one knows how to classify vector spaces with a single endomorphism, but how does one classify groupoids with a single endomorphism? Maybe the situation is less clear with categories, rather than groupoids, but it may also be that these two roles, metamathematical, and an algebraic structure with partial operations, merge in some situations. For me, that is one of the fascinations of category (and groupoid) theory. And my definition of Higher Dimensional Algebra is as the study of partial algebraic structures with operations whose domains are given by geometric conditions. 

The Algebraic Data splits into several equivalent kinds, ranging from "broad" to "narrow", related by Dold-Kan type equivalences. The broad data is used for conjecturing and proving theorems; the narrow data is used for calculations and relating to classical methods. As examples of Algebraic Data we give groupoids, crossed modules and crossed squares. We give a sample computation, using crossed squares, of the homotopy 3-type of the mapping cone of the classifying space of a morphism of crossed modules. 

There is a fundamental reason why CW-complexes $X$ say are useful, namely for the purpose of constructing continuous functions $f: X \to Y$ by induction on the skeletal filtration $X^n, n \geqslant 0$, and for going from $X^{n-1} $ to $X^{n}$ knowing that you have to construct the extension only on each $n$-cell $e^n$. The topology on $X$ is arranged precisely for this purpose. So a complicated space is put together from simple ones. It is this possibility of constructing continuous functions, and also homotopies, which allows for the proof of the Theorem of Whitehead mentioned above. It interesting to trace the development of this concept from his earlier papers for example Whitehead, J H.C. On incidence matrices, nuclei and homotopy types. Ann. of Math. (2) 42 (1941) 1197--1239, which introduced the term "membrane complexes, which are so to speak more elastic than simplicial complexes". The idea was to avoid the subdivision into simplices by amalgamating them. This paper, and others, were rewritten after the war, in terms of the CW-complexes we know and love. A crucial point was to be able to construct not only continuous functions but also continuous homotopies of these. For these a result on the product of CW-complexes was needed, which I was told took him a year to prove. He also early on formulated basic results on adjunction spaces, which are now clear in terms of pushouts. I feel the emphasis on filtrations is crucial, and allows for other methods in algebraic topology. 22 Nov 2013: Grothendieck in his "Esquisse d'un programme" Section 5 (English version available here, see p.258) discussed what he feels is the inadequate nature of topological spaces for certain geometric considerations. When foundations are under consideration, one should take a "no holds barred" attitude. This agrees with the advice of Einstein: "What is essential and what is based only on the accidents of development?... Concepts which have proved useful for ordering things easily assume so great an authority over us, that we forget their terrestrial origin and accept them as unalterable facts. They then become labelled as "conceptual necessities", "a priori situations", etc. The road of scientific progress is frequently blocked for long periods by such errors. It is therefore not just an idle game to exercise our ability to analyse familiar concepts, and to demonstrate the conditions on which their justification and usefulness depend, and the way in which these developed, little by little..." 

I have to like and suggest ideas connected with the Seifert-van Kampen theorem for the fundamental group and its extensions to groupoids and higher groupoids. An anomaly in traditional approaches, centred on the fundamental group, was that this theorem did not compute the fundamental group of the circle, which is THE basic example in algebraic topology. The reason is the the circle cannot be represented as the union of two path connected sets with path connected intersection. The solution was to use many base points rather than just one, and so to work in the context of groupoids; this dates from 1967 and a fairly recent account is in the book Topology and Groupoids. This extension led to ideas of using higher groupoids in homotopy theory, and so to define higher homotopy groupoids, with higher order Seifert-van Kampen theorems. By 1984 this led to the idea of a nonabelian tensor product of groups which act on each other, see the bibliography. As an example, if $M,N$ are normal subgroups of the group $P$, then the commutator map $[\;,\;]: M \times N \to P$ is a biderivation and so factors through a universal biderivation, a morphism $\kappa: M \otimes N \to P$. For example if $M=N=P$ then Ker $\kappa$ is isomorphic to $\pi_3SK(P,1)$. Thus taking groupoids seriously in algebraic topology has led to new algebraic ideas. 

Have a look at our Knot Exhibition, which aims to explain how mathematics gets into knots. It explains some of the methods used: representation, classification, invariants, analogies, laws and applications. The applications come after one has developed the necessary concepts and methods, and may also be motivated by such potential applications. Mathematics develops rigorous language for expression, proof, analogy, verification, falsification, calculation. As an example, the language of abstract group theory was developed by many pure mathematicians, and was found necessary to determine all the 230 crystallographic groups, and also to develop the theory of quarks. The abstract language of mathematics is really about analogy. Much modern pure mathematics is about describing abstract structures, relating them, often via category theory, and the difficult task of describing their interaction. For this, numbers are not enough.
