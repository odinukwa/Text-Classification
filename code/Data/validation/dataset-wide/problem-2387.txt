There is both clinging and aversion here. Do neither (push away or hold onto) - just view both the bliss and the sound with equanimity. Equanimity is a core skill you are learning in any vipassana practice. So let go of the need to 'control' any of this and just try to see that all these phenomena have the same intrinsic nature as a 'thought', a body sensation, a physical sound. They are all phenomena with the same above three characteristics. 

My take on what Daniel is trying to describe here is a deepening appreciation of the granularity of perception. The use of the word 'vibrations' in this context is a bit unorthodox hence your search coming up short. In some of Burmese Vipassana traditions, emphasis is placed on the experiencing of arising and passing of phenomena at very subtle levels. In this context this is a powerful insight practice into impermanence at a fundamental level - arising and (complete) cessation. Ajahn Brahm mentions this in Mindfulness, Bliss and Beyond (p. 203): 

While doing some reading I noticed the following which may shed more light on you question. Pa Auk Sayadaw and Tina Rasmussen teach that returning to bhavanga-consciousness between jhana states allows a review of the jhana factors that were present in the jhana which, according to them, is not possible when absorbed in jhana: 

Wallace goes on to claim that in the Vajrayana tradition a Ghatika is also considered an ideal meditation time because it is the time it takes for the subtle energies to do a full body circuit. Longer duration sits will of course be multiples of a Ghatika. Some poking around on the internet reveals it is a Vedic measure of time - Vedic calculations of time and creation and was measured using a Ghatika Yantra, an ancient Indian water clock. I can find no reference to meditation apart from Alan Wallace references. Can anyone else perhaps shed more light on this? 

So concentration, energy or equanimity need to be applied skillfully in the moments when they are appropriate to deepen the meditation (refine the gold). This brings to mind intensifying in the "The Brahmin's Thread" method, one of four methods to set up Samadhi in the Mahamudra Tradition: 

So in the context of Samatha (concentration) meditation, Jhana states naturally arise as a consequence of concentration. What I'm struggling to understand is the term 'Vipassana Jhana'. Is it a state of mind that arises from insight or a state of mind conducive to insight? 

There is both no gender difference in the Lotus Posture and Vajra Posture or any other difference whatsoever as far as I'm aware. These are interchangeable terms for the same posture - the former has its root in Hatha Yoga and latter in Tibetan Vajrayana. There is, however, a gender difference in the Sattva Posture which is often recommended in Tibetan traditions if full lotus is not possible. This is maybe where the misunderstanding may have started? In the 'The Tibetan Yoga of Breath: Breathing Practices for Healing the Body and Cultivating Wisdom': 

These preliminary practices are considered essential before journeying into the intermediate and completion stages of Vajrayana which, traditionally, cannot be done without a qualified teacher. Recommended reading - A Beginner's Guide to Tibetan Buddhism 

Definitions of the term Jhana tend to emphasize the 'mind state' quality it refers to in various states of meditative absorption: 

You are using enormous amounts of unnecessary energy identifying with these emotions i.e. not being mindful. This is likely to lead to other negative emotions like depression which in its turn leads to negative thinking patterns which then cause more negative emotions. So in a very real sense you are falling into patterns that quite literally 

While researching stages of meditation, I came across something which could shed some light on your experience. In a section covering Khanika Samadhi (momentary concentration) I found a similar description of your experience. While the author is writing specifically about the noting technique in Vipassnana, I think technically it has relevance to Goenka scanning as well. 

Why some people think "this same X is bad" and others think "this same X is good"? They are applying their frame of reference to the world. For Buddha even if they think X is good but this belief leads to suffering then they are delusional. An interesting and related topic worth mentioning here is the role of Mara. In Buddhist stories, that have their origins in the Pali Canon, relate how Buddha was tempted by Mara (a kind of demon figure) - Maara Legends in Canonical Texts. You could equate the temptation of Buddha by Mara to the temptation of Christ by Satan. The two stories are very similar. However, without the underpinnings of a cosmic battle between good and evil, Buddhism's view of what Mara is, or represents, in these stories is much more nuanced than Christianities concept of the devil. In Buddhism the general consensus is that Mara is merely the personification of all the unwholesome (akasula) qualities and so ... 

I've been reading books written by, or associated with Alan Wallace, that describe a period of time that is new to me - Ghatika (24 minute period). 

It may be of interest to note that in Buddhism the three main causes for all the other defilements are ignorance, attachment, and aversion which then lead to anxiety, fear, anger, jealousy, desire, depression, etc. 

There are many Buddhist lineages in Tibet and all of these have variations on what they consider to be preliminary practices or ngondro. So in order to answer your question generally you have to look for preliminary practices that are common to all of the main lineages - Kagyu, Sakya, Nyingma and Gelugpa. The 'common' or 'ordinary' or 'outer' practices are generally considered to be the Four Thoughts that Turn the Mind or the Four Reminders. These are more philosophical musings that prepare the mind and motivate the person to continue their practice: 

I think something is lost in translation here. It has been mentioned before that Thanissaro Bhikkhu sometimes is off the mark in his translations. If we look at some other translations of the Nimitta Sutta - Piya Tan argues that the three bases mentioned in the sutta are: Basis of samadhi, The effort sign and The equanimity sign. So 'uplifted energy' here equates to 'the effort sign'. He argues further that the three nimitta are specific conditions for meditation in the sutta and that they are conflated with the 5 spiritual faculties. 

Awareness of the granular nature of reality is not immediately obvious and Daniel's practice of the two-finger technique cleverly serves to concentrate the mind to notice at increasing frequency the arising of the perception one finger and then the other. Mahasi Sayadaw's noting technique has the same effect but is more open ended. 

The Buddha wisely recognized these truths that are now being verified in the laboratory. So this is very sage advice and I second it: 

Directed attention (Vitakka) - directing the attention to a particular perception. Sustained attention (Vicara) - sustain attention on an object. Rapturous interest (Pita) - When vitakka and vicara are steady, a feeling of lightness and pleasure naturally occur. Deep ease (Sukha) - Sukha is a quality of happiness that is much quieter and smoother than piti. One-pointed attention (Ekaggata) - Ekaggata’s characteristic quality is to lock on to the chosen object with an intimacy that rivets the attention, stills the mind, and settles into unwavering focus. 

In this context, rather than being 'states' to be attained, as you seem to allude to in your question, the three bases point to a particular mental orientation in meditation session itself. Applying too much concentration, energy or equanimity in a sitting leads to unsatisfactory results. This is illustrated further in the Namitta Sutta by Buddha in the simile of gold refining: 

Do doctors waster their chance as you put it? They are human beings and so we could surmise most do and some don't. Do they have a privileged position to exercise their humanity? 

Neutral feeling can give rise to boredom, restlessness and confusion which are clearly obstacles to insight and equanimity. 

I've come across this term recently and have seen quite a few opinions and definitions. My understanding is that it is actually a hardcore Theravada movement that is in some ways a conservative backlash against watered down Buddhism in the West. Is this a correct assessment? 

Factors - these are the factors or qualities of the various Samatha Jhanas - joy, well-being, equanimity etc. Momentary Concentration (Kanika) - ability to stay focused on moment-by-moment arising and passing of phenomena. Access Concentration (Upacara) - ability to stay focused on on a somewhat contrived stable object i.e. the breath, color, shape etc. Absorption (Apana) - stable, one pointed mental state. 

Like noting, I find the technique very useful in developing Kanika which in turn is essential for insight practice. As a side note:- having been on a Goenka retreat myself, the use of the word 'vibrations' in a Goenka context is different. Goenka actively discourages noting as a technique. According to Goenka, noting increases our separation from raw sensate experience. From what I could glean from the Goenka discourses, what we experience at subtler and subtler levels beyond the gross bodily sensations are Kalapas (he actually uses this term and sticks to the Visuddhimagga doctrine that they extremely fast vibrations - billions of time per sec - of subtle reality). Our experience of these sensations at a body level has a vibratory quality to it. 

Understanding of 'Anatta' is key to so much Buddhist meditation practice and philosophy that I've been exposed to but (call me conservative) I gain great confidence when the Buddha himself had something direct to say about the term / concept. There seems to be common consensus that 'anatta' means there is no abiding self / Self. Christopher Titmuss in his list of what the Buddha did not teach says: 

In Mahayana, the cognitive defilements prevent 'reality as it is' (inherently empty and dependently arising) to be known fully. In other earlier schools of Buddhism, seeing through the illusion of an independent self was seen as enough. Mahayana takes this a step further and points to the inherent emptiness of any independent phenomena. In the Yagacara (Consciousness Only) Buddhist school the 'belief in an independent self' is seen as an afflicted defilement and 'the belief in independently real phenomena' as a cognitive defilement. These work in tandem to obscure direct apprehension of reality. For further reading I recommend Edward Conze - Buddhist Wisdom: The Diamond Sutra and The Heart Sutra For Edward Conze ... 

There is more subtlety to the mind's relationship to feelings than only craving or aversion. The Vedanās and the underlying tendencies that arise are described in the Pahana Sutta (SN 36.3) like this: 

Having studied Avaita Vedanta for some years, I recognise Buddha's early approach as pure self-inquiry i.e. recognising that the self is not in any of the skandhas, that we normally identify with, which leads to directly to the real Self. Is it true that there no support in Digha, Majjhima, Samyutta, Anguttara, or Khuddaka Nikayas for the commonly held doctrine? I feel this is an important question as this view has implications for the commonly held view that Buddhism is humanist, nihilistic, compatible with atheism, secular etc., when the Buddha himself held no such position.
