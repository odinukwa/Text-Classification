And it also claims the severity of child anaemia due to cord-clamping is exaggerated and there are other factors involved: 

Yes, if you use sunscreen. No, if you use sunblock. Sunscreen absorbs an amount of radiation, but not all (sun protection factor is used to measure effectiveness): 

No. "to determine" is a categorical verb. Maybe "to suspect" would have been more appropriate. So, what does body language include? According to The Free Dictionary by Farlex: 

Tai chi has improved symptoms in other inflammatory conditions (and non-inflammatory). Knee osteoarthritis: 

Yes, it is effective and safe. Both preclinical and clinical studies have established the safety and efficacy of cryolipolysis for noninvasive body contouring [1]. Cryolipolysis has demonstrated efficacy in both human and animal studies. Histology findings also confirm the selective reduction of fat in both humans and animals, with evidence of a gradual thinning of the fat layer over a period of two to four months. Importantly, cryolipolysis has not produced any significant adverse side effects in studies to date and any noted effects have been minor and temporary [2]. Erythema of the skin, bruising, and temporary numbness at the treatment site are commonly observed following treatment with the device, though these effects largely resolve in approximately 1 week. To date, there have been no reports of scarring, ulceration, or alterations in blood lipid or liver function profiles [3]. Although the mechanism of action for cryolipolysis is not yet completely understood, the efficacy and safety of this non-invasive procedure for fat layer reduction has been demonstrated in the studies available to data. Further studies willl assist in identifying the mechanism and elucidate the full potential of this technology to perform safe, non-invasive fat reduction for areas of local fat accumulation [2]. 

But this doesn't apply in case of alopecia areata because it is an autoimmune disease nor in the case of androgenetic alopecia which has hormonal etiology. The paper in your update states: 

Yes, they failed because they were turned off by operators according to the protocols for such situations and couldn't be turned on again due to the unanticipated lack of power.

Conclusion Yes, body language is useful to detect someone's emotions. So, why my answer to the main question is "no"?
