It appears, like a lot of other math economics uses, this one was lifted from fluid dynamics. From Wikipedia: 

Assuming your home is safe, would you keep your money in a bank that only gave 96% of it back? (-4% interest rate) What if your home has mice which eat exactly 10% of your money? Would you then keep your money in the bank that only returns 96%? And finally, what if every bill has a 10% chance of being eaten? This means that in expected value you lose 10% of your money. In the above situations, what would be the lowest interest rate you would accept from the bank? 

If you are looking for classification like Agri-food trade presentation that covers products other than agricultural, you should check out the Combined Nomenclature (CN) of the European Union and its Explanatory Notes. It is established on the basis of the Harmonized System and it covers all the products that can be subject to customs and tariffs in the EU. Seek Annex I to the the basic CN Regulation (Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff). Be sure to use the latest version, though, as it is updated on a yearly basis. Here's a link to 2018 version, but if you want to be accurate, you should also include amendments (there were five of those since publication of 2018 verion). Perhaps the most readable is of course Explanatory Notes to the CN (so something like this). If you are interested in jurisdictions other than EU, please find links to cusoms nomenclature under Harmonized System's wikipedia page, you've posted. I'm sure all of them will have the same problems as Harmonized System. It is simply impossible to explicitly list all the products in the World and such listings will always be half open with use of phrases like 'not elsewhere specified'. Hope that helps. 

Sure it can, because the maximal profit is 0, and that level is attained at all output levels. A similar problem is a profit maximizing firm with constant returns to scale. If such a firm has a maximal profit it can attain then that profit level is 0. If the maximal profit level was something else, it could be increased by doubling or halving production. 

If you owe euros you have to pay in euros. If for example the British government owes euros, then they get some funds (perhaps take another loan) and in case this is in a currency different from euros they convert it to euros on the market. If the sum is large enough it is wise not to convert it all at once but in smaller installments. This way the exchange rate stays stable and you can also get a better deal. So nothing will happen to Greece's debt because they leave the Eurozone. But as the whole issue is political, there could be debt relief/partial bankruptcy because of the same reasons that might cause them to leave the Eurozone. About printing drachmas: There is a technical issue to be addressed: It is not the government that prints money but the central bank and their goal is maintaining price stability, not providing the government with revenue. (In time of crisis this may change.) Printing money causes inflation which in turn will weaken the drachma relative to the euro. Usually when the state prints drachmas all drachmas would be worth less, but states wealth may increase because their share of drachmas increases. However, this is a special case because there are no drachmas at all. So initially all drachmas would be owned by the state. Hence I think if they print more the worsening exchange rate would balance it out. What they could do would be to print some drachmas, exchange it with whomever was willing for euros, and then print more. This would only work if printing more is not expected. 

Both current 40 hour workweek and its predecessor, 48 hours workweek with 6 days of work are a result of 8 hours workday. 8 hours comes from the division of 24 hours into three equal parts: 8h sleep, 8h rest and 8h work. JoaoBotelho and Brian Romanchuk are right - it was direct result of the XIX and early XX century organized labour’s struggles, which was based on employees observations of their work fatigue rather than a result of a scientific research. Perhaps the first, who tried to measure the effect of a 8h workday from the productivity standpoint was Henry Ford, who introduced 8 hour-workday in 1914. 

From time $0$ to time $t$ the profit flow is constant $\Delta$. The discounted value of the profit flow of any instance $s$ is $\Delta \cdot e^{-r s}$. To get the total discounted profit we will need the integral of this from $0$ to $t$: $$ \int_0^t \Delta \cdot e^{-r s} \ ds = \left. \frac{\Delta \cdot e^{-r s}}{-r} \right]_0^t = \frac{\Delta \cdot e^{-r t}}{-r} - \frac{\Delta \cdot e^{-r \cdot 0}}{-r} $$ And as $e^{-r \cdot 0} = e^0 = 1$, this is $$ - \frac{\Delta \cdot e^{-r t}}{r} + \frac{\Delta \cdot 1}{r} = \Delta \cdot \frac{1 -e^{-r t}}{r}. $$ 

(source: Our Own Time: A History of American Labor and the Working Day, David R. Roediger, Philip Sheldon Foner - please refer to this source for broader context and more information on the 40 hours workweek in the U.S.) Around the time of the I Word War, legislators started introducing 8 hour-workday (both in 40 and 48 hours-a-week model) pressed by workers movements, but there weren’t any hard calculations on this issue. Later studies confirmed employees and Ford’s observations: there is a workhour-health limit of around 40 hours on average. The last research I know of, Hour-glass ceilings: Work-hour thresholds, gendered health inequities (Social Science & Medicine, 2017 vol. 176), calculated this limit to 43.5 h per week for men and 38 h per week for woman. As to your second question, please make it into a different post and we'll answer it. 

Depends on what you mean by 'possible'. The liquor stores in your example could form a union, and collectively bargain with brands. Then if a brand breaks a contract with one of them, they all break the contract. This would greatly disincentivize the brands' strong arm practice. In my opinion this is unlikely to work (it is very hard to organize), but it is 'possible'. 

An example: Student type $t_1$ has 10 points to bid based on her GPA. Her favourite courses are A,B,C,D,E. Student type $t_2$ has 0 points to bid based on his GPA. His favourite courses are F,G,H,I,J. Student type $t_3$ has 1 point to bid based on her GPA. She ranks the courses alphabetically, A being best, Z being worst. (Or if there are only fifteen courses then O, as that is the 15th letter.) Assume sixty $t_1$ type, sixty $t_2$ type and one $t_3$ type students. If all types were to subscribe to their favourite kind of courses, then A,B,C,D,E would have sixtyone applicants and hence they would be oversubsribed. F,G,H,I,J would have sixty applicants and would be full. $t_3$ may lose the bidding war in a reasonable equilibrium of round 2: If all type $t_1$ students bid 2 points on each course they will all get their favourite picks while $t_3$ type, who can only bid 1 point will lose out on all picks. Now she can only pick K,L,M,N,O, as F,G,H,I,J are already full. She would have been better off if she had picked F,G,H,I,J in round one, as there she would have one the bidding for at least one of the courses. Thus the 'truth-telling' strategy is not an equilibrium and hence the mechanism is not incentive compatible. 

Please see below historic results from Amazon’s first public annual report from 1997 (the year of IPO): 

As for an easy reference, @denesp cited an interesting source on this. There are some slight differences in the data, so I thought I would cite it alongside with annual report data, which is more precise. 

This is what I gathered during my research of this topic: Evo Morales' policies are more centered on economy than they appear. See, for example, an article from May 2017, which praises them for being fiscaly conservative and austere, despite socialist and anti-imperialist rhetoric. 

The book Why Nations Fail deals with the first question extensively. It is a highly acclaimed work (though personally I was not always convinced by their reasoning) by renowned economists Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson. Their basic argument is that inclusive democratic institutions lead to greater growth because it safeguards business and economic interests of the people. Hence they see the biggest obstacle in undemocratic cultural traditions and lack of institutions. An argument I read somewhere (perhaps it was the Dictator's Handbook) is that developed countries prefer dictators in power to fledgling democracies in other countries. The reason is that fledgling democracies are not very stable, and that is bad for investment. Also dictators may be bribed more cheaply to disregard their people's best interest. (For example they may not implement environmental regulation for a price. The same may be said for democracies, but the price is usually higher.) In this way business interests in developed countries may directly contribute to dictatorships, which according Acemoglu and Robinson is what hinders economic growth. 

The author, however, criticized this view saying that there is no empirical evidence for a development view between relational rationality and transactional rationality (the author’s main interest is the difference between cultures of East and West). 

It is very common for a company to have a loss (i.e. expenses > revenue) in the first year. Amazon is actually a very good example of that. It’s also a good example of ‘growth before profit’ strategy. Amazon was incorporated on July 5, 1994, and begun service in July 1995. This means that not only it did not generate profit in its first year, there were also no sales. Even after the launch the company generated loss: 

I will not discuss fairness (for example employers gains versus employees gains and bargaining power) principles as you did not ask about those. Is "crowding out" the right phrase here? Even if inflation lessens the effect of a minimal income there may still be an effect. Imagine that there are two people, $A$ with an income of 0 $B$ with an income of 60, so total income is 60. The government issues a minimal income of 30 so $A$'s income is changed to 30, total income is changed to 90. If this has no real effect on the economy then all prices rise accordingly, that is they rise by 50% because that is by how much nominal incomes haved changed. However if you adjust for this 150% price level, $A$ still can buy goods in value of $\frac{30}{1.5} = 20$ while $B$ can buy goods in value of $\frac{60}{1.5} = 40$. So there could at least be a redistribution effect as previously $A$ could not buy anything and $B$ could buy more things. One concern is that inflation may not be even. Only the income of poor people will be raised hence demands for goods poor people buy will rise but demand for rich folks will not change. As a result the poor may experience larger inflation than the well to do, making the redistribution of incomes one between only poor people. The lines between poor and well to do here are murky. If (due to inflation) a pop-tart costs \$10 then people will buy quality food unless it is even more expensive. If a pop-tart's price rises to \$1,000 people will buy caviar unless its price is also raised. A hope of governments implementing such policies is that (aside from fairness and solidarity principles) a minimal wage will also help minimum wage earners be more financially secure. A lot of studies have shown that in extreme poverty you make worse decisions and are less productive simply as a result of stress. If this is indeed a main effect then a minimum wage (or a higher minimum wage) can increase overall productivity. Thus inflation will not be the only effect of the policy but also an increased number of goods will be produced.
