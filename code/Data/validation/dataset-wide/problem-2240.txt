Although this may sound redundant - go see a doctor. I generally accept pains for about month, anything longer makes we worry something is wrong. At 2 years... And I would focus on hand-therapy(stretching and warm up regularly throughout the week) rather than equipment. My friend is 30yrs old and couldn't ride a bicycle or drive a car for a long time because after a while he would develop wrist pain. He started a physiotherapy 2 months ago and claims his pain has significantly receded. I haven't been swimming for long, but I've noticed fatigue in my hand because I try to keep my hand firm to avoid too much water flowing between my fingers. Your pain sounds like what I used to get in acrobatics after gripping my partner in a lift for too long or too intensely. But those pains would hold for about a week or two and then go away. Maybe you're form is good, but you started keeping your hands too stiff two years ago (which is hard to observe for a bystander). Maybe you started a different sport at that point in time that could have impacted your hands. I find the fact that you've had this problem for two years more worrisome than having pain after training. 

This is done to show that they are a "Dead Eye" shooter from 3 point range. According to dictionary.com the term "Dead Eye" refers to "an expert marksman". The three fingers are held up to symbolize the three point basket that they just made and they look through the hole made by their thumb and forefinger to symbolize the "dead eye". As far as the high salute I'm not sure, however they will often slide their hand down their hip to symbolize holstering their "gun" that they used to make the "shot". 

This is definitely different for every sport, so I think it is hard to make a general statement. So, I will attempt to answer the question from the point-of-view of fantasy football and the NFL. There is evidence to show that it actually hurts ticket sales. In 2012, the NFL will require that teams show fantasy statistics at all stadiums. The belief is that fans are staying home to keep track of their fantasy football teams instead of buying tickets and attending games. Since ticket sales have been on the decline* for the past 5 years or so and subscriptions to services like NFL Red Zone and NFL Ticket are on the increase, it would stand to reason that the increase in popularity does not necessarily mean an increase in ticket sales. While this may be good for the NFL, it is not good for the individual clubs. It is worth noting that this impacts the NFL harder than other sports due to the fact that at least 50% of their games are played at 1:00PM ET on Sundays. So, if you are attending a game, you are likely missing out on the majority of other games going on that week. The impact may not be nearly as severe with fantasy baseball or fantasy basketball. *: warning- article is dated 2010, but the 2011 data was skewed due to the lockout and the 2012 data is not yet available 

Forgive me if I don't know the archery-terminology, its been years since I've released an arrow. My primary advice is to go shoot at a local archery range if you're a beginner, and you'll probably get competent advice there as well. When I started to shoot, I didn't buy any equipment - I could get a beginner's set of everything I needed at the archery range at which I trained. Once I started going to competitions (who says your dad won't? : ) I bought my own equipment and also maintained it, but that was after 2 years of using standard rented equipment. Plus - I found the crowd at archery ranges to be quite easy going, a very pleasant surrounding to spend time. Health: First off - the health issue. I practiced competitive archery for 3 years, and don't recall ever getting an elevated heartbeat. So circulatory problems shouldn't be a worry. Depending on the volume of arrows you shoot, or if your bow is too strong for you, you can have cramps and muscle-aches in the back/shoulder area. But if you take it easy at the beginning, and slowly work yourself up to higher volumes and a heavier bow, you should be fine. Equipment:This is an overview, best to consult someone at the shop or better yet at an archery range, about buying equipment. The expensive stuff(bow, arrows), you'll probably be able to rent at the range for a membership fee, and is what I'd start with, until you feel you like archery enough to buy your own bow/arrows. 

It is my assumption that the "waiver wire" that is referred to by Adam Schefter and other NFL writers is just their term for the communication that happens between NFL and the NFLPA, et al. Which is to say, the communication from the NFL that the player has been cut. So, if the Indianapolis Colts have already filed the appropriate paperwork with Peyton Manning and the appropriate league offices, the latest that he should be available to be contacted by other teams would be tomorrow at noon. 

The BCS rankings are determined by averaging together two human polls and six computer rankings starting in the 8th week of the regular season. A team's ranking is determined by the following: Harris Poll - 1/3 of the ranking is determined by the Harris Poll which is a weekly poll of 115 invited sports media members who rank the top 25 of the 120 teams in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision. In this poll the media assign each member of the top 25 a value from 1-25 with the top ranked team receiving the value 25. For this reason, the highest possible value that a team could receive (if voted #1 by all voters) would be 2875, so each team's overall score is divided by 2875 with the highest possible ranking being 1.00. Coaches Poll - 1/3 of the ranking is determined by the Coaches' Poll which is a weekly poll of 59 coaches in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision. It is important to note here that most coaches are unable to watch all the teams play each week and will typically have the Sports Information Director at the school create the rankings on their behalf. The same values are applied to each team here as in the Harris Poll, except the highest possible value is 1475 instead of 2875. Computer Rankings - 1/3 of the ranking is determined by the average of six computer rankings. The six computer rankings are Anderson & Hester, Richard Billingsley, Colley Matrix, Kenneth Massey, Jeff Sagarin and Peter Wolfe. Each computer ranking uses a different formula to rank the teams based on factors like wins, losses and strength of schedule with the highest possible score for a team being 1.00 just like in the human polls. The individual formulas used are largely unknown, but it should be noted that starting in 2004 the BCS prohibited the computer rankings from including margin of victory in their calculation. Since the formulas differ so much (some give more weight to the value of a conference win compared to a non-conference win, for example) the highest and lowest rankings received by the computers for a given team are not used to calculate this average. These three pieces are then averaged together to create the BCS rankings for the top 25 teams in the NCAA FBS and the teams are ranked in reverse order based on their average score. 

Good luck to your dad. In the end, good shooting is about securely repeating form. Equipment comes second. 

I recently went for a professional medical massage, and felt incredibly relaxed afterwards. He only did my torso and back, but the breathing feeling was so free I felt incredible. I sit all day in front of a computer, so my shoulders are usually quite tight - I felt like in heaven. I could imagine, that the relaxed feeling would allow me much better control over my movement during a run, as well as breathing ability. About 24h after though, I had quite some sores along the primary massaged muscle groups. Two days later I'm feeling fine again, but my upper body is as tense as always. So I'm wondering if a massage is a stress on the body that would interfere with the stress of a competition. Is there any drawback to getting a massage before a competition? (I run, swim and bike, but I assume this could apply to any sports discipline). 

I'm in a similar situation, albeit I only run half-marathons and bike up to 60km. When I started swimming I had the exact same problem, that I couldn't breathe according to what felt a good swim effort. In the end I relaxed my swim speed as well as allowed my self to breathe every time I pulled back with an arm. I really focused on my breath and feeling good in the water. Everything else was secondary to being able to breathe calmly. I train in a group, and before I would have to take a break every 50m and wait till my breathing came from a frantic gasping to a relaxed in-/exhale as while running. After the change I swam slower, but could actually manage 1h30 of training, where previously I would be at the end of my strength after 30min. Now, a few months later I can keep up with my group, and I breathe every 2 arm pulls, sometimes every 3 to switch breathing sides.
