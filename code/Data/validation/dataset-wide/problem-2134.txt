Surely you have to tell the people around you that you're meditating, or else they'll disturb you. I'm aware that sounds around you become part of your meditation. But what happens when someone wants to talk to you? Two minutes of someone saying your name, followed by poking you, checking your breathing (unnecessary: you're already doing that yourself), and finally calling a first aider over because you aren't responding, is more than you're expected to take :-) Once you tell your colleagues that you're meditating they might still think you look asleep but at least they'll know why you look that way. Either this is acceptable on work time or it is not. If it is then get on with it. If it's not then do it in your lunchbreak, before clocking on, make up the time at the end of the day, whatever your employer allows. I have meditated at my desk on occasion, but only in a small office (3-4 people). I've also eaten lunch at my desk on occasion. Nobody stormed in and told me it wasn't allowed. My employers have always been happy for people to "clock off" and do their own thing at their desks. So people might watch video at lunch time, even play computer games. Of course normally these activities are interruptible -- there's a natural assumption that if you're at your desk then you're available to communicate. That's why you need to explain this special case and pay attention to any negative feedback you get about it. There are workplaces and roles where meditation won't be permitted, or where it's totally inappropriate for you to be sat at your desk not working. Reception, for instance. Air traffic control ;-) I guess if you're even asking, you don't expect yours to be one of those. If in doubt ask your boss. 

Most importantly, it tells you that they think those characteristics are important or impressive (although perhaps only indirectly, in that they think you think they're important for this role). You might be able to conclude more from the fact that someone thinks loyalty is worth mentioning here, than you can from their belief (or claim) that they're loyal! It doesn't tell you that they actually possess the characteristics to any remarkable degree. Especially something completely vague like "out-of-the-box thinking". You might read that and figure that all of your candidates think out of the box, not just this one, but some of them would call it "having a good idea". As for whether there's any merit in it -- if its a CV posted online, then it makes a lot of sense to have some kind of summary up top indicating what kind of jobs you're looking for, why you want them, and what basic attitude you bring. This kind of "personal qualities" stuff often creeps in there. If it's a CV submitted for a particular application with a cover letter, then it probably repeats stuff from the cover letter, although it might still be a worthwhile summary of why they're good for the role. You could view it as a reading comprehension test, "has the candidate accurately identified and summarized what the role calls for?". Ideally it's backed up by relevant experience, in which case it serves as a sort of abstract of the result the author wishes to prove in this paper, but that's not always practical. If you believe yourself to be unusually loyal it might be quite easy to present examples of this, but quite difficult to put those examples in your CV, which operates well above the level of specific incidents in which you demonstrated loyalty. Therefore this statement in the CV is (intentionally or otherwise) bait. It might induce you to ask at interview a question that the candidate has (you'd think) prepared for. Of course, if you cared about loyalty then you'd be asking all candidates about loyalty, and if you don't care about loyalty why waste interview time drawing a rehearsed answer? So you can argue it's complete pointless as far as that goes, except that I suspect in practice it does occasionally prompt an interviewer to talk about something they otherwise wouldn't, just like the also-controversial "hobbies" section. It would seem to me irrational to ignore this information in a CV, if you would pay attention to exactly the same thing written in a cover letter (I'm not sure if you're saying you actually do that not). Unless you're extremely busy and have clear instructions written in whatever process they went through to submit the application, it's pretty much nonsense to punish applicants because they don't follow your conventions of what goes where. 

Someone in the company has to be the youngest, and companies don't as a rule list out their current employees, and choose the youngest person to replace them with someone older. If anything, the opposite, they replace those who retire. The company has intentionally hired someone junior to their existing staff: the only reason this would be a concern is if they made a mistake and don't really want/need that role at all. But that applies to any newly-created job, it's not specifically about being junior. Reasons that they've chosen to hire a junior instead of a senior programmer might include: 

I would say that (1) is usually not appropriate in a meeting since it very visibly occupies the time of everyone present, whereas (2) is also available and only occupies the time of one person. (2) might also be straight faster, in that editing a document to correct a simple error is usually quicker than describing the error to someone else to correct. In fact, the person writing the notes might have spotted the error themself but already have decided to favour (2) over (1), and therefore will not slow down to fix it because they'd rather press on with their "rough notes" now and fix them later. If that's the case then you wouldn't be providing any benefit at all, you're just fixing something that would have been fixed anyway. If you're "that person" in the company who spots every spelling mistake and typo, then you can offer to spend time copy-editing, but you shouldn't make that offer of time on behalf of everyone in the meeting unless the meeting is generally agreed that it's worth it. If the purpose of the meeting is to give final approval to a critical document then sure, correcting every little thing as you go might be entirely appropriate. I'd also say that if there's a persistent typo that people keep making with an internal name (for example if people keep on writing "KMDFM" in place of "KMFDM") then it might be worth mentioning. It becomes not just about correcting the error at hand, it reduces the number of future errors by raising awareness of the persistent error. This is more valuable than merely correcting a one-off typo. As for tone, personally I would rather hear "it's KMFDM, you typed KMDFM" rather than "oh, sorry to interrupt, but I think you might have made a very slight typo there. I think where you've written KMDFM it's actually possible that you meant KMFDM instead". But this can be very specific to the culture and the individual. Some people appreciate others being brief and confident in pointing out clear mistakes. Some people prefer to have the area of the error highlighted (especially when it's by a junior) so they can check it and make their own determination whether it's really a mistake. Some people require that their juniors never point out their mistakes in public under any circumstances, regardless of wording. It's also specific to the kind of error - if the person you're correcting isn't embarrassed by typos then they might welcome a direct contradiction even if they'd prefer you be more equivocal over matters of judgement. 

Firstly, consider what you've lost compared with if she'd told the truth in the first place and offered you $9 full time. Did you turn down any other jobs that you'd have taken in preference? If all you've lost is 6 days job-hunting, for which you've been paid, albeit 10% less than you expected, then this situation isn't all that bad. If the job you would have wanted turns out not to exist, you can just quit any time you like. If you wouldn't have taken the job for $9, then don't keep the job for $9 either. Having nothing written down cuts both ways, she can hardly expect you to work out your notice. The best time to quit is probably when you've just been paid (because you're working for someone who is trying to cheat you), and/or when you've found another job. So ideally find another job, tell them you can start the day after your next payday, quit without notice once you have the money. So, that's one option. Now think about what you've lost compared with if the job she described really exists, and you can take a shot at getting that. The way to do that is to go over her head, say that you were offered $10 and a guarantee of full-time work, and that if you don't get that (with back pay and in writing) then you're leaving. If you don't get it, leave, and learn a lesson about written contracts. Give them a very short time frame, you can't let them string you along while they delay. Since she's the hotel manager, I expect it's pretty unlikely that corporate will do anything, although I don't know the hotel business. They have no evidence that you're telling the truth, they've barely even heard of you since you're a new employee, and even if they give you want you want you've still got to work for someone who you've humiliated. Therefore, it might not even be worth asking. But you never know, maybe you fit a pattern that they're already aware of. Only if you've suffered substantial loss as a result of the deceit, and you can "prove" the loss and the details of the original offer, does the issue arise of whether this is fair or not. It isn't fair, but the fact that it's unfair doesn't help you unless you have a case to begin with (and maybe not even then, since a lot of things are unfair but legal).
