Explanation of Feedback from Manager Since this is based on a performance review, did you ask for an explanation on the feedback your manager gave on your review? If not, this is where I'd start. It's quite possible the feedback is justified or has been miscommunicated to you - Understanding exactly why your manager feels the way he or she does is the first step in this process. Why are you not happy? Once you've received an explanation of the feedback, ask yourself why you're not happy about it? Is the feedback justifiable? Are you not happy based on it purely being negative feedback, or is it that you're not happy based on the feedback itself in which you feel isn't true? If it's purely based on it being negative feedback, then perhaps it's not negative feedback at all, but constructive criticism? If you feel the feedback doesn't represent what you've done since your last review, then... What can you do to rectify the feedback? A great, professional way of taking such feedback and putting it to good use is to ask your manager to help you create a plan of action on how this feedback can be turned into positive feedback. What steps can be taken to make sure this never shows back up on your performance review again? Is it possible to get the previous review amended once all of these steps are completed? Final Steps Ultimately, talk to your manager - but go about it in a professional manner, try putting yourself in their shoes to see their side of the story - If it's still unjustified then you must ask yourself is it enough of a blemish to take actions a step further, or is it a small enough disagreement that it can be looked over. If the feedback is really getting to you and you think it's important then explain this to your boss, if he/she refuses such - then take it to his superior or an HR representative. (Noting that this would need to be a pretty extreme case for me to do the last advice given, and only in the most dire of circumstances - such as career-ending.) 

My opinion. Split up the work experience to show your internship. I always split up my work on my resume to show each job promotion/position change. Displaying on your resume that you were able to get a paid internship on your studies, and that the company thought highly enough of you to move that internship to a full-time employee position is a great compliment to future employers looking to hire. It shows that you were able to make the next step in the company when other's may have been competing to obtain the same position. An internship can also be considered professional work experience as you were actively participating in company-level work for a particular field. 

Regardless of how you work to tell them "Well, the way we have our core code setup currently this wouldn't work" or "This would give little value, technically, to our customers." Instead, talk business with them. These people know money and they know charts. When giving a feasibility assessment at my workplace my development department always makes sure that a quote is included, and that this quote not only factors in the monetary value of what it would cost time and resource wise - but sanity wise as well. If the project is not likely to give any value or be too problematic to try and fill then the quote is upped. Pricing for the work, and possible showing of Return on Investment is going to be the easiest way to get through their head to show them that it's a bad project idea, from their point of view. If you're unable to do so with either of these, then it's probably not an infeasible or bad idea. 

It's great that you've come to this realization yourself, as most would not innately recognize problems with their communication until someone else pointed it out to them - so you're on the right track. Let's take each of your points individually, and see where improvements can be made. Panicking during Presentation Many people have this problem, and the best way to solve this is practice. Check with local colleges around your area to see what classes they have in relation to public speaking. Many people blow off what it takes to effectively present an idea, but I can tell you that it is as much of an art form as designing/developing the product/service that the idea is itself. Pressing Your Idea & The Idea Not Getting The Attention You Want It To Unless your a salesman, it seems based on points 2 and 3 that you're getting too emotionally attached to whatever it is that you're presenting. You shouldn't be pressing your idea on anyone and only hoping that they come back with a pat on the back to tell you that they think your idea is great. On the flip-side, you shouldn't be discouraged if you've presented an idea and that idea has been shot down, or has been declined for whatever reason. If you're going into a presentation of your idea/product/service and you're only interested in hearing good news, then what is the point of presenting the product in the first place? For secondary validation? No. You're presenting your idea so that others can give feedback. Your idea isn't perfect. If it was, you'd have developed a perfect product by now - and a perfect product doesn't exist. If your presentation is lack-luster, or you find that there are many people in the presentation that doesn't care for the idea then you need to take the criticism they've given you - and rework your idea. That withstanding, no one likes everything - and you will find that your idea/product/service isn't liked by all. That's also OK, that's why we have market segments. Summary You're too emotionally invested in whatever it is you are presenting/discussing. Detach yourself from it. You'll have a million other presentations/discussions in your lifetime, and working yourself up over each one is cause for an early grave. Take the feedback (in whatever position that person is in) and go back to the drawing board with your idea/product/service and properly analyze if the other person's criticism has any merit. Personal Experience I'll throw in my own personal experience into the mix. When I'm presenting a new idea/product/service to prominent leaders at my workplace - I usually carve out around 65-80 hours to outline, prepare my speech, identify any common questions, and create the presentation. Presenting is A LOT of work, and throwing something together last minute and hoping that people latch on to whatever it is that you're presenting will more-often-than-not lead to you getting caught with your pants down. Additionally, prior to deciding that I want to actually present the idea, I'll bounce the idea off of a few people. These people WILL NOT be my colleagues, anyone on my team, my department, or anyone related to the idea if it actually becomes a project. Instead, I'll bounce the idea off of my wife, family members, the administrative assistant down the hall, my mail man, etc. - and tell them in a way that would be meaningful to them and that they'd understand. If I'm in a room full of programmers, and I have a programming idea - the chances of me actually getting any unbiased feedback is pretty slim. If I bounce the same idea off of my wife, she's going to give me innocent feedback because she isn't affected by said idea and is only looking at it from an outside perspective. 

I'll expand on JeffO's final paragraph. Let's analyze the important key issues of the situation you're in. 

So what have we done? We've understood what needs/issues your business unit members have and what they would like to do about it. We've categorized these needs/issues into logical groups, and developed a plan(SOP) to answer these needs/issues as they come in, in a long-term setting, in a generalized way. There's a good chance that some of these needs/issues aren't able to be categorized - these are the needs/issues that your boss SHOULD be making individual decisions about and "wasting his time" to answer. These are specialized, unable to be categorized, and require a more personal touch. 

So you have a boss that doesn't micro-manage, and a team that needs, at least some level, of micro-management. So what should you do? Here are my suggestions: 

Hold A Meeting - Yes, meetings can actually be productive. Get with the business unit and find out what current issues are outstanding and waiting for your boss' approval/decision making. Find out what other needs the business unit has. Write these down, document these issues/needs clearly for yourself. Categorize Needs/Issues - The list you've obtained from the meeting is bound to have some similarities. Considering that this is a small company, there's a good likelihood that Standard Operating Procedures/Process Control is non-existent. Your boss doesn't want to hear the same question from X number of different employees every week, this is where SOP's become your friend. Once you've categorized/linked similar issues you can now make a new list - but with these categories. Back to the Business Unit - Take your list of similar groupings back to the Business Unit. Let them discuss together, how they would like going about solving these questions and understanding what their answer to these questions would be. Make note of each members solutions. Do not finalize or make any decisions at this point in front of the members on the issues/groupings. This is just a brain-storming session to get a feel of how your business unit reacts to issues and what best suits their current style. Build Some Mock SOPs - Now that you have your list of similar issues, and feedback from the business unit members - take their expert knowledge in their positions and your innate ability for coordination and coaching and begin to devise generalized SOPs for as many of the issues as possible. Rough draft these out. 

Lists. My favorite thing in the world, and when it comes to hijacked emails/threads lists wins big. Dealing with many conference calls, long email chains, etc etc. I've found that being able to moderate multiple parties at one time is one of the biggest skills you can possibly gain in the workplace, this is how I do it: So another resource begins using your technical thread as a repository for their information gathering as well. When this happens I usually will step in and try to bring focus back on the subject that was originally in the email by asking a series of specific questions or information that needs to be identified by myself/department or putting the focus back on hand by specifically naming steps in which needs to be completed by the customer/yourself in order to get to the end result that both parties are looking for. Basically creating a list of tasks within the email itself so that the receiving party can see what tasks are at hand and when the email chain will come to a closing. This method seems to work for me most of the time. It draws the customer/receiving party back into the topic without displacing any bad blood within the email itself. 

I'm upvoting this as I specialize in a portion of IT, and therefore I'm not "The IT Guy" that's usually stereotypical of people to coin me as. I haven't worked on generalized computer hardware or software in a troubleshooting role in a long time. My specialty involves healthcare information technology, though in every company I've worked for I've been clumped into generalized IT. Far too often to I find myself being confronted with employees asking me to re-image their computer, run virus scans, fix their email accounts, etc. Not only do I not have the ability(security-wise) to do this, but I haven't worked in this arena in so long that I wouldn't know what's going on if I tried. Much like patients going to a hospital and not expecting the medical records personnel, nurses, janitors, etc to be employees holding MD's, or vice-versa for the credentialing. Employees shouldn't expect every person in "IT" to know everything about computers. It's too broad of a generalization. It's why the field has specialties - and it is a personal pet-peeve of mine, as about 90% of my job is specialty related and 10% of it is computer related. In closing, you shouldn't be changing out toner cartridges as a programmer. From a personal perspective I'd consider this as a slap in the face as far as knowledge goes. From a business perspective you don't need a programmer on payroll wasting their time doing mundane IT tasks that an intern could do - or better yet, with proper employee training that anyone could do. 

Schedule a Meeting With Your Boss - Based on your description, your boss is more likely to respond to a meeting invite than he is to a ad-hoc email/walk-up question. So schedule a meeting. Explain to him what you've done so far and what you've collected, go through a high-level overview of the SOPs you've made up (bring a copy for him) and go through the list of specialized issues that are needing his attention. Explain this in a way that he understands - that you are working to try and save him time by putting processes in place that will limit the amount of questions he has while still continuing to allow the business unit to be productive. He will get this - because time is precious to him apparently. 

Surely something can be brought up that has interest to all parties. I'm not sure how big your company is, but judging by the statement that other people are giving presentations on different projects that can in no way help others by knowing that aren't on the project, I'd say it's fairly large. Perhaps you could try speaking with your boss and maybe scheduling for special guests to come to the meetings. A director, manager, or technical lead from another department that can come in and speak to you about what their department does, how it affects your department, etc may be boring...but it gives one valuable thing. Face-time. In larger companies face-time with departments/people you don't know may prove to be that of a chaos theory and have your name whispered in another's ear, resulting in a promotion, or raise, or just better standing all around. So for my suggestion, use it to learn more about your colleagues or people from other departments to sell yourself and your skills. 

The company that I currently work for did 1 phone interview, 4 face-to-face office interviews, 1 psychiatric evaluation, 1 criminal background check, 1 blood and urine sample testing, and the final leg of the interview process was a meet-and-greet with my department. The company is housed in 5 separate buildings across the city so I was able to explore all the company grounds as well as meet and get a feel for how the team was going to be. Not only is this an interview process from the company's standpoint, but this is an interview process with a positive reinforcement for you. You'll get to, hopefully, see your office and where you'll be working - the people around you and get a feel for their general attitude towards the company and yourself, and how your management presents you to other people. This could make or break your decision as to whether you would want to work at this company, so please make sure you take just as much of this opportunity for you to assess the company as the company is going to assess you. You also shouldn't hesitate to ask your human resources contact at the company as to what to expect, as it could prepare you for some events that may otherwise come as a surprise. You'll find, especially if you stay in the corporate world, that the higher your wages are and the more responsibility the position is the more "perks" and longer the interview process will be. The 1 interview and your hired the next day is no more, welcome to the better parts of the Corporate World. 

Ultimately, your boss is the decision maker - so any changes to these SOPs or specialized decisions that he makes is law. Responsibility is taken off you. You look like a winner with both your boss and business unit for taking initiative and hopefully will make the business unit run smoother. These steps also plays towards your Coordinator/Coach approach. This isn't a bad situation for you to be in, it's a win-win situation for you if you play your cards correctly. 

This is going to be dependent on how you're paid, truthfully. If you're a salaried employee, tough luck honestly. You're paid to work as many hours as they need you to work, that's the beauty and the beast of being a salary employee. If you're hourly, then it would be legally wrong for them not to pay you for any time worked during these on-call hours. They don't have to pay you for "being" on-call, but rather from the moment you answer an on-call phone call until that work recesses. And, if you're contracted and it's not stated in your contract then you should probably ask for a renegotiation of the contract. This is, if you feel as though they would negotiate this issue instead of just terminating the contract and yourself and finding someone who's willing to do this work. Something you should think about when asking for a renegotiation. Usually on-call hours come with a higher rate if it's hourly/contracted. Most companies that I've worked for that paid extra for being on-call(I've worked for others who didn't pay anything) they've set this payrate as a company standard for all employees.
