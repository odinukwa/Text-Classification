I believe the answer is a "guarded/qualified" yes. If 2/3, or more, of the owners of a given area want to separate from a larger area, and have not been coerced to do so, they have the right to do so. What gives them this right? They are the owners of the area. 

U(t) - Current state of universe U(o) - Initial state(condition) of universe K - constant of proportionality d^2P(i) - second derivative of part(i) of the universe dt^2 - second derivative with respect to time I hope this helps. 

There was no confusion. It derives from the influence from the Old Testament Law - "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." Although this was modified by the New Testament, "if someone slaps your left cheek, put your right cheek", and "love your enemy," it has taken time for some of this attitude to get into our judicial system. Complying with the New Testament "mandate" requires the abolishing of capital punishment, but because a part of society feels it is a violence deterrent, it is retained. If we are interested in teaching our children that capital punishment is wrong, we as individuals, need to be satisfied with life imprisonment as the maximum "punishment." 

I don't believe that there was/is prehuman logic. Natural Selection, randomness, and time, account for the "improvements" of the various species. No logic was required! 

If there is no such symbol, one can be easily created by "inversion" of the existing symbol. If skeptical consequence is sc, then credulous consequence would be,-sc. Or contact the "entity" responsible for the creation and standardization of symbols and request/propose the creation of such symbol. 

Probably the most important incommensurability in the history of science was none other than the discovery of incommensurability of course! Sometime around the 5th century BC a Pythagorean (conjectured to be Hippasus) discovered and logically proved that some numbers like √2 can't be expressed as a ratio of whole numbers. This brought Pythagorean mathematics, founded on the basic assumption that all of mathematics and everything in the universe can be reduced to whole numbers and their ratios, to a screeching halt. Greek mathematics at this stage underwent a complete philosophical reboot, and geometry supplanted number as providing the foundations of the rest of mathematics. Had the doctrine of number not failed, we'd probably refer to Pythagorean Number Theory and the Pythagorean Method like we do to the geometry of Euclid and the axiomatic-deductive method as the beginning of the history of formal mathematics. 

Actually, it's the opposite. Here's a simplistic overview of why: Suppose you do a finite amount of mathematics (prove a finite number of theorems from a finite axiom set). But by the incompleteness theorems, there are some theorems that simply cannot be proved. Thus, no finite amount of mathematics suffices to encompass all of mathematics. It's instructive to look at a specific case study of what situations like these actually look like in the course mathematical research. The first and still most famous case is the ancient question of whether or not Euclid's parallel postulate (PP) can be derived as a theorem from the first four axioms (the postulate states that There is at most one line that can be drawn parallel to another given one through an external point). One way geometer's posed this problem was to attempt to re-prove all the old Euclidean results from scratch without invoking the axiom of parallels, and see how far they could get. This system of geometry, Euclidean minus parallels, is called Neutral Geometry because it is neutral about whether or not the parallel axiom is true. The question is then, does Neutral Geometry end up being equivalent to Euclidean Geometry anyway? And of course, they failed time and again to prove PP within Neutral Geometry, and so they eventually started focusing their research on more indirect approaches, like considering what taking "PP is false" as an axiom would imply and presumably something absurd would result. One way to falsify PP is to say that we can find at least two parallel lines through a point, in contrast to at most one. Counter-intuitive results followed, but it this system was surprisingly proved to be consistent regardless, and it came to be called hyperbolic geometry. Whereas before geometry was a single unified system codified by Euclid, both complete and consistent, was shown to be but a stem of an ever branching family geometr*ies*. This is what really makes the implications Godel's incompleteness theorems so profound. It guarantees the openendedness of mathematics. In the beginning there was geometry and arithmetic, and then algebra and eventually calculus/analysis. The subject matter of mathematics could be understood in completely taxonomic terms: space, quantity, structure and change. But today we can see that mathematics exceeds any definition in terms of subject matter. On might say that mathematics is more of an art: the art of being creatively logical through the media of abstraction. 

There is such a thing as "synergy," were the total is greater than the sum of its parts. I think that reasoning is what "allows/causes" the synergy. Thus, reasoning also creates knowledge. So you have observation, experimentation, and reasoning, as the sources of knowledge. 

Even though I consider myself a very devout Catholic and I firmly believe in God, I know I don't have a godsense. However, I also know there are people that believe they have a godsense. I think this is primarily due to some people wanting to believe that they have it, regardless of whether they do or don't. 

It depends on what meaning we give to "akin." If it means "similar," then the answer is yes, it is similar to believing in magic. If it means "the same," then the answer is no, it is not the same. 

It seems you are using the singularity of the "output" (purpose) to imply (require) the singularity of the "input" (final cause). It is certainly possible to have a single input (cause) for a given output (purpose), but it is also possible to have multiple inputs (contributing causes) for a single output (purpose). 

To be able to answer the question, I have to start by defining what "free-will" is. My definition is: the freedom to change(or not), select(or not), any and all decisions. Without free-will, the ability to "change your mind" would not be possible. So, to answer your question, what free-will gives someone, is the ability to change their mind. 

The thing about 'why' questions is that they presume an answer exists, whether or not an answer actually exists. Suppose I answered your question with "You should behave morally because such-and-such reason." That reason would then be an incentive to act morally. But we're operating under the premise that no such incentives exist. Contradiction. I also object that the very idea of actions without consequences might not even be coherent. An action is something done so as to accomplish a purpose. They are by definition characterized by the intentionality of agents. If there are no consequences, then by the same token there are no actions either. 

I also would disagree with Kuhn on whether many of his supposed examples of "paradigm shifts" would actually qualify as such. However, I think there are better and clear examples of paradigm shifts in the history of science, which if nothing else serve as proof of concept. In fact, I was reminded of what is probably the best example by the questioner's accidental word choice here: 

At this point you probably notice something peculiar, namely that this truth table is awfully familiar. It turns out your modified conditional would just be completely equivalent to standard logical conjunction. Another oddity to note about this modified "condition": just like conjunction, it's symmetric with respect to p and q! That means, it doesn't matter which one of p and q you call the antecedent and which one you call the consequent. It's this property which it makes virtually useless as an operator whose intended purpose is to capture our intuitive notion of a conclusion predicated on a conclusion. As example to illustrate how important order is in changing the meaning of a statement, consider the Zeroth Law of Biology. The Zeroth Law states that "If you have had kids, then your parents have had kids." The converse statement, however, is obviously empirically false, so order matters here. Hence, we'd naturally disregard any alternative kind of conditional operator that fails to distinguish order. 

Sizes of infinities This section is less relevant to your initial question, so I've split it off from the main answer, but it is important if you want to get a deep understanding of infinities. Cardinals Two infinite sets are considered to have the same cardinality if we can establish a one-to-one mapping between them. For example, the set of all integers, ℤ, has the same cardinality as the set of ℕ, which we can prove as follows: Let a be an arbitrary member of ℤ. If a is negative, we map it to -2a-1. If a is non-negative, we map it to 2a. This results in each element of ℕ mapping to a unique element of ℤ, and vice versa, so we can say the sets are the same size. On the other hand, we cannot do this with the real numbers. The proof, using Cantor Diagonalization, is a bit long to explain here, but understanding it will go a long way towards helping you understand infinities. The cardinality of the reals may be the next element in the set of cardinals, ℵ_1, but this hasn't been proven. There are an infinite number of cardinalities. In practice (at least in my field), we can just classify the infinite cardinals as "countable infinities", those of cardinality ℵ_0, or "uncountable infinities", which is every other size. Ordinals There are also an infinite number of ordinals. After ω, we have ω+1, ω+2, etc. After all of those, we have ω+ω = 2ω. And so on. 

I think the correct word is intelligence, not consciousness. If I am correct, then a higher level intelligence should be capable of: Faster and more efficient space travel. Telepathic communication. Eradication of most deceases. Peaceful coexistence with themselves and other beings. 

I would agree with your "trial criteria," if you change the title to "What are the criteria for physical existence." Although physical existence is a major part of "existence," there are additional parts. Abstract and/or mental existence. Although dragons do not physically exist, they do exist as words and symbols in books, in movies, and in human minds. Nation, city, family, etc., do exist: physically, and as words, and as abstractions. 

Yes, the argument that "a woman has the right to control her body" (and thus should be allowed to decide to or not abort), is invalid. It is invalid because a fetus is not part of her body (even though it is being nurtured by her body), and thus, can not be under her control. 

If I interpret "I am" to mean "I exist," then the conclusion is false. The reason for this, is that if you don't exist, then thinking or not thinking is not applicable. If you do exist, then it is irrelevant whether you are capable of thinking or not - you already exist! 

Whom ever is not allowing him to go home, obviously has authority over the "old man"! Have the same person(s) (under the same authority), issue the order to clean and repair the home. Ethical problems (if any) for the daughters, solved! However, the hoarding problem will not be resolved unless/until the underlying (psychological) reason(s) that caused the hoarding are addressed.
