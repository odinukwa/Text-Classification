Often times I find I'll be writing an email with a question or comment pulled from several online references (Rally user stories, Governance docs, sharepoint files). As such, while I will summarize these references, I also turn them into hyperlinks directly to the document referenced. Nine times out of then, I have it open anyway, so grabbing the URL isn't hard. From my perspective, I would appreciate the links for clarification, but I find almost no one else uses them. Is the inclusion of these links considered poor office etiquette for some reason? For an example of how I would typically do this link inlining... 

While I try my best to make sure that anyone who I may be working with knows I will be out of office anytime I'm out for 8+ hours, I realize that that is a very easily forgotten fact. I've been toying around with the idea of setting my OoO message the day before I leave, to let people know that I will be gone tomorrow and possibly following days. This allows people to ask me any questions they have that may turn into blocking issues while I'm gone. On the other hand, I realize that people see the out of office message and may assume I'm out of office now, which sends the wrong message. So, my question really is, is it common to start the out of office auto-reply a few hours before I actually leave so that people can get any last minute questions in? 

I would suggest leaving these off without further study. It's great that you got some hands-on time with Java, Python, Ruby, and Selenium, but if I were interviewing you and you said you gained valuable in-depth experience with all of these technologies in only a week (you mentioned you were fired from the last position after only a week), I'd be very VERY skeptical, to the point that it would almost hurt your chances. Honestly, I feel like you should leave the position off your resume, and only post it in your work history. If the interviewer asks about it say something like "I was let go due to XYZ, but XYZ has been fixed". Assuming XYZ is innocuous, something like say, lack of reliable transportation, then it shouldn't hurt you too much. It might help get more quality answers about how to approach the situation if you were to post why you were let go as well. 

That is in no way cheating. Most companies encourage it. You don't have to identify him as your friend. Just tell the manager of the department that is hiring that you have someone you would like to refer for the position, and ask who you should speak with in HR. 

The management team is interested in dollars and cents, so give that to them. Show them the dollars and sense of a new set up (sorry, couldn't help myself). Pair up with someone who can create a cost-benefit analysis regarding your needs. 

Our company was recently acquired by a large MNC. We recently started the same practice. They are called "Employee Engagement Surveys" or something of the like. The survey should be anonymous since the company just wants to get a feel for how engaged the employees are while they're at work. The idea is that the more enthusiastic the employees are, the better work they do. The intention behind the surveys is for honesty from the employees. If they truly want honesty, the survey will be anonymous. If they give the front of being anonymous and come to you later and say "I noticed you said 'bad place to work, payment bad.' Would you care to go into further detail?" then I would say to brush up your CV. I know I wouldn't want to work somewhere that put that kind of practice in place. Find out if the survey is anonymous. Just bring it up politely with your manager. Say something like "I was wondering if you could give me some more general information about the surveys. I don't need to know the questions, just how you plan on using them." Be honest, but keep it professional. Even if the survey is truly anonymous, a rant will set off red flags for the management team and they will start looking for the trouble-maker in the office. 

Catess, since you've only put your applications in, I'd recommend not actively persuing one at the detriment of persuit of another. At this early stage, it's great to consider which jobs you'd prefer, but since you haven't been contacted for any of them, it'd be in your favor to make sure and be attentive and respond to all possibilities with equal enthusiasm. The ball will be in your court once you have job offers to compare, but until then, make sure and keep up with any communication and diplomacy with all three possible employers. One thing to keep in mind is in this situation, even an interview does not constitute an offer. Just because you've had an interview with your dream employer, don't skip out on contact with the others until you have the job secured. 

So, I'm considering going out job hunting again, and I've read it's always good to have a portfolio of your work handy. Unfortunately, the results of my work are rather boring to most people (An JavaScript/html calendar similar to JQuery's day-picker, an active html analog clock, etc). Alternatively, I have side projects that are more interesting (an Arduino sketch for a player-guitar, an Arduino sketch for an led grid that simulates light patterns similar to what you'd find on the bottom of a pool under moving water), but less useful in the real world. I'm trying to not be too broad or make a question which only has subjective answers, but I'm also trying to understand what sort of code and projects a recruiter might be interested in. I feel like my utilitarian code is more useful in the real world, but my side projects show more of an aptitude and ability to problem solve. Which would a recruiter be more interested in? 

One option would be to ask them how they will go about making the decision on who to hire. It doesn't directly ask about other candidates, but they might discuss the need to review other candidates or close out internal applicants, etc. 

Depending on where you are applying, I would not worry about your last name too much. Many (most?) people from countries where Slavic names are not common do not understand what the 'ova' suffix means. In the US, for example, there are quite a few women of Polish descent with last names ending in 'ski' rather than 'ska' and most are probably unaware that the ending is 'incorrect'. Given that the requirement to make names gender neutral is restricted to hiding first names, I think it is safe to assume that whoever posted the ad is unfamiliar with Slavic last names and the fact that they can reveal the person's gender. 

This is information I appreciate having when considering a candidate. A slow recruiting process can be for any number of reasons. Knowing that the window to hire you is closing can help them accelerate it if you really are their top candidate. If you are not, they may encourage you to take the other offer and shift their attention elsewhere. 

You are describing a "Project Lead", "Project Manager" or "Technical Project Manager" role. You are not describing a lead developer role. A lead developer is one that actually writes (significant amounts of) code, sets the design and possibly architectural direction for any code written, influences or defines style choices and other practices. As BinaryBazooka says, you also played a "Co-Founder" role in getting the project off the ground and moving. I would suggest calling yourself Co-Founder and Project Manager and focusing more on those details. Those are the skills that would make you attractive for a similar project leadership role where you are not expected to make significant direct technical contributions. If you sell yourself as a lead developer and people want to hire you for that role, the disconnect with your actual skills will likely prevent you from getting those roles. 

The candidate should call back if they have all the information they need. It will show the candidate is eager to talk with the recruiter about the position. The company should call the client back. Take care of your customers and show that they matter to you! I would say here, an email would work better than rushing for the phone. Figure out who is going to call first, then finish the conversation. 

If your self-criticism is constructive, then I don't see how your managers could frown upon it. If you're up for the task, maybe even do a self evaluation in the style of a performance review. Try and stage it at a mid-way point between when your organization does them. 

In your question you seem to separate self-criticism and constructive criticism. These two things are not mutually exclusive. Self-criticism is the source. Constructive criticism is only one type of criticism. I would think, like Edwin mentioned, 

My email client has a signature option. I don't put anything at the bottom, I just let the signaure handle it. Most of us in our office have something nice and generic like "Regards," for ours. 

I'd say he needs you more than you need him at this point. The coding and deployment process may be outside your scope, but he needs the coaching regardless. Maybe you should explain the consequences of his actions to him. Lay out exactly what his poor coding / deployment processes do to damage his business. You mentioned that he is a co-founder. If you can, talk to the other co-founder(s) and see where you can get with that approach. 

Apply for the jobs. The first step of getting the job is getting the interview. You will never know if you are disqualified from a position if you never apply for it. As for your skills.. what is your desired skillset? What do you want to be when you grow up? See @Cronax's answer as well. Opportunities can present themselves in a company to switch technologies. I have seen a co-worker start off as a database developer and wind up as an iOS / objective C programmer. Get your foot in the door somewhere. Be grateful for your first opportunity. But never stop being a student of the game. If you start off as an xyz developer, but abc is fascinating... get a book and read it. Do the homework problems and hone your skills. 

I'm being sent by my employer to a conference in another state. Having barely traveled of my own accord, I know nothing about how travel works, especially when (partially?) paid for by someone else. What questions should I ask my manager before I go? At this point, I don't know what I don't know. Things that may seem common place that I've never had to manage before 

Screens Screen brightness is a pretty rough thing in your eyes. Play with your screens, make sure that they only case as much light as they need to in order to be visible, and no more. A lot of folks prefer warmer colors as well. If your eyes are hurting, it may be worth it to consider trying some filtered glasses - The jury is still out on the long term benefits, but in the short term after eight hours in front of three monitors, my eyes don't hurt as much when wearing my pair. 

This seems like something I would probably be informed of at my next eval, not a rather informal email from someone a couple levels of management above me (I'm thinking the subjects of the email were CC'd by mistake). Given the size of our company, formal changes in your position are always done with at least two members of management present. This wasn't CC'd to my direct lead (or Jim's, Joe's, or Bob's), so I'm hesitant to ask them about this, but I'm really not sure how to respond to this or if I should just ignore it until I'm told about it in a meeting. 

You have to remember, there are a lot of things actually going on when you are at your office chair (or your bed with a laptop). Here are a few common aggrevations from office life, some I didn't even think of until they were pointed out to me. Keyboard 

Nit picking over details like this, especially if it is only done for you, likely indicates that someone is unhappy with your performance and is trying to build a case to have you dismissed or otherwise encourage you to resign. Just because your line manager or the MD "helped" you when you provided incontrovertible evidence that you were unfairly singled out does not mean that they are on your side. Likely one of them is the driving force behind your arrival times being closely monitored and your pay being docked. It would be rare for HR to act like that on their own initiative. As docking your pay is likely a symptom of the way they are responding to something else that the MD and/or your line manager see as a deeper problem, you need to try to understand what that deeper problem is. It would also be in your favor to ensure you are never late as that will eliminate this avenue of attack for them. 

For someone like this, where common practices such as getting things in writing or confirming receipt are not working, there is not much to do. It sounds like you already have plenty of documentation (e.g. signed purchase order with the 800 pound / day rate) of his behavior. I think at this point you need to initiate a discussion either directly with him or with his boss about his behavior and how it impacts your work. 

The key message is: you should not be the team police officer. Instead, you should introduce them to some good practices, potentially through Lunch and Learn sessions or similar, and then see if you can get them to agree together to try some out. You will likely need management buy in for some of these. Most of the bad practices you want to avoid are covered in teams I work with by automated checking or self-selected, self-enforced group policies. For example, we have automated tools in the build that do static code analysis and report warnings when things are not properly checked. We collectively agree on enforcing a zero warning policy and the builds are monitored (by the team) to ensure compliance. Code reviews are instituted as standard practice: every change set is reviewed by another developer. In this way, no one is singled out for closer scrutiny.
