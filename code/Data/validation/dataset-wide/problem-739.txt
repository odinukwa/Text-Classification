I can't imagine how it did it as I didn't think there would be enough clearance between calliper and rotor, but the actual problem now I have gotten around to pulling off the back wheel is that the mobile pad got thrown and hence no fluid leak just a missing pad. @zenbike thanks for answer however. 

I braked hard today and felt the pressure in my disk brake drop very suddenly. Since that point the brake has not been working with no action at the calliper and little pressure in the lever but not spongy. Any one know the likely cause and whether a bleed might fix. I can't see any evidence of fluid leakage. 

The frame isn’t safe for using anywhere. The potential danger is that the stay will break most likely locking up the back wheel. It might be merely inconvenient or it might be fatal taken in combination with speed or traffic. A possible reason for the crack is inappropriate use of the frame e.g jumps, crash damage or it might just be an old cheap Walmart frame which has fatigued. The frame seems to be alloy from the lack of rust in the fracture. It can’t be fixed within the scope of the bikes probable value. The presence of V brakes and a stamped metal derailleur indicates a low end bike. Salvage parts if you want and transfer to a not broken frame or just purchase a whole new one. The cost balance on that task will depend on whether you have bike fixing skills and tools or whether you need to take it to a bike shop. Seriously, don’t use this bike as it is right now. 

I should quickly define a few words to avoid ambiguity in what follows: Strong == Force / Cross-Section Area. Durable == Strain (deformation) energy in the material before failure. Endurance Limit == Asymptote where alternating stress does not decrease with additional load cycles 

In buying a used bike, inspect it in person, and gain trust that the owner took good care of it. I bought my bike used as well - personally, I think thats the way to go - but there is some level of unavoidable risk. 

To your next question: Life Span Materials with an endurance limit have an unlimited fatigue life (for a max rider weight) in theory. Carbon fiber and Steel have an infinite fatigue life... In theory. If stresses are below the endurance limit, the material does not weaken and can undergo theoretically infinite stress/load cycles. Other non-ferrous alloys like Aluminum do not have an endurance limit, the material continues to weaken with additional stress/load cycles; eventually they are destined to fail- bike makers design aluminum frames to last far in excess of the what someone might ride during the bikes useful life. 

Chains usually only break when lateral force is applied to them. To have one break on a single speed drivetrain is fairly rare. I'm gunna give your LBS the benefit of a doubt and assume they installed the chain correctly. The problem with changing just your chain is that it's only one piece of a system that wears as a unit. As your chain wears it actually gets longer, this is a result of the friction from the pins taking metal off of the inside of the bushing in each link, which lengthens the measurable distance between each pin. As a result, the cog starts to wear on the pull side of each tooth. An example of an excessively worn cog: 

If its just up and down one gear then you probably need to calibrate the derailleur cage a little using the barrel adjusters. Depending on the make of shifter and derailleur there will be a barrel adjuster on one or both ends of the cable outer which will allow you to make micro-adjustments to the cage position. The jockey wheel centre should be roughly aligned with the center of the cassette cog. What you might find is that the jockey wheel is slightly left or right of the cog at a given shift position (the one that is jumping) so use the barrel adjuster to eyeball the wheel to line up with the cog. It shouldn't take more than a few turns to do this. Also if the barrel adjuster is fully extended or screwed in, you may have to release the cable at the derailleur end and move it in/out to give you some adjustment room before reattaching the cable. On the other hand if you are getting more than one shift up or down something is seriously wrong and you may have to replace parts. 

In reality, many things affect fatigue life and strength in materials. Scratches (even small ones) are a Very common cause for significant failures to develop/propagate in all materials. Alloy frames suffer from incomplete welds or poor heat treatments during manufacture as possible causes of failure; typically alloy failures are not catastrophic (and safer) because the metal bends (giving obvious and ample warning) before breaking in half. Carbon fiber is increasingly sensitive to impacts. Where alloys bend, carbon is brittle and might crack or de-laminate (where layers separate, first at the micro scale, leading to macro scale cracks and failure. As cracks develop, surrounding areas take more load, causing the existing crack to widen. Carbon (and composite failures in general) are more catastrophic in nature because carbon is more brittle and there is little warning or time before the carbon breaks in half. Voids (small air pockets trapped in between carbon layers) during manufacture, if present, are likely causes of failure. UV radiation and extreme heat, or oils and solvents can degrade the epoxy/bonding agent. In practice, normal bike use leads to failures - ie. Handling the frame with dirt and sand on it, A rock kicked up from a tire impacts the frame, You fall, The frame gets scratches in the car or on the rack, Take your pick. So while the materials themselves have an infinite fatigue life, life happens and failures happen; bike makers continually tweak their designs and techniques to avoid real-life failures but they happen. 

You're not going to be able to buy just the floor stand without the clamp unless you chance to buy one at a yard sale or on ebay, you might be able to contact Park Tool and ask them if they can send you just the floor stand without the clamp as a replacement part, but I doubt it for that particular stand. My advice would be to just buy the new stand, amazon sells them for $90 less than their listed price. And you can get them for even cheaper than that on ebay. Then you can keep you bench mount for spare parts or just leave it where it is and have two stands. You could try building a floor stand out of chain link fence parts depending on the size of post you need to fit the clamp. The cheapest solution would probably be to buy one post (or borrow one from a local school) and a floor flange, and either bolt it to your garage floor (permanent) or to a big piece of thick plywood (which will eventually break). I don't recommend looking at getting piece of plate steel like the PRS Deluxe stands have, because I've looked into it before and the size plate you's want would cost almost as much as a new PCS stand would. If you can get anything free by chance or from a junker/someone you know then that's a bonus. But like I said, I think you'd be better of just to buy a new stand. 

To your question: Bonding Agent The bonding agent is (in theory) as strong as the carbon fiber epoxy, but structurally, it is the weakest over-all material in the joint. Carbon Fiber >> Aluminum >>> Bonding Agent or Epoxy Remember, carbon fiber is composed a the cloth-like carbon fiber soaked in an epoxy (another bonding agent), effectively gluing carbon sheets together. At the macro scale, the carbon fibers transfer most of the force and the epoxy is just there to hold the carbon fibers together. At the micro scale, only the epoxy and bonding agent are bonded. I cant speak with respect to specific bonding agents or bike makers, but from an engineering perspective, the bonding agent should be as strong and durable as the carbon fiber epoxy, though weaker than individual carbon fibers or aluminum. While the bonding agent and epoxy are close in strength, the bonded area/agent is the weakest material in the joint: At the micro scale, this is where deformations (strain) and stress are largest and failure begins at the macro scale. 

The first thing you need to recognize is that you literally have less than half of your original stopping power. Riding without a front brake puts excess strain on your rear brake. You are very dependant on your front brake for the majority of your stopping power, especially when trying to stop quickly, as momentum will load your front wheel while decelerating and lift weight off of your rear. Rules for stopping effectively with only a rear rim/disc brake: 

Get some Factory Effex Frame Protection Material, It's a vinyl that you just stick to you frame. You can get it in Black, Clear, or Carbon. 

I sold Specialized bikes for a lot of years, they do make gender specific frames, women's bikes have shorter top tubes relative to the seat tubes, this is because women on average have shorter backs and longer legs than men do, they also come with womens saddles, and sometimes women specific grips (for feminine hands). The Sectour is considered a men's frame. Not everyone is built the same though, my wife rides a men's frame because she is really tall in the body. The only other difference between men and women's Specialized frames is that women's frames sometimes have "girlier" colours and paint details.
