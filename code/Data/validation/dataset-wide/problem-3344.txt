The IPA symbol that is similar to a question mark is the glottal stop symbol, which indicates the glottal stop phone, a sound made by completely obstructing and then releasing airflow at the glottis. This sound occurs as a phoneme in many languages and is very common as an allophone and/or articulatory artefact in most. In san serif fonts the glottal stop symbol may appear identical to a question mark but without the dot below [Ê”], or have a horizontal serif at the base as in the following: 

Bambara, Niger-Congo family. Here the motion verb na 'come' is used as an auxiliary indicating futurity: 

Interlinear glossing for isolating languages is often done without any extra tiers or labels beyond the usual ones. This is largely because, as is pointed out in a comment, the free translation in an interlinear gloss provides a way into understanding the constituency, even where this is not shown by morphosyntax and associated morphemic gloss. But extra forms of labelling are sometimes used to show constituency. These amount to a kind of bracketing (although they may not use actual brackets) and may be placed on an extra tier. Christian Lehmann discusses this, with examples, in section 4.7 of this paper on interlinear glossing, though he urges keeping bracketing to a minimum. Another example of constituency labelling is in this article on the isolating language Weining Ahmao (Miao-Yao/Hmong-Mien family, China), particularly pp 590ff. The glossed texts are also nice examples of the previous point about the use of free translations to understand the phrase structure of the vernacular text. The WP article on the grammar of Vietnamese (the canonical isolating language) also has numerous examples with interlinear glosses and in a number of cases uses labelled coloured bars to show constituency. 

Some examples of dialects of English Britain: Received Pronunciation (or RP), Yorkshire English, Estuary English, Scouse, Norfolk English, etc. Through various historical accidents RP came to be the most prestigious dialect. The USA: General American, North-Central, Midland, Greater New York City, etc. General American is the variety with the fewest obvious regional features, and is used especially in the media. Rick Aschmann has an excellent and detailed introduction to North American English dialectology. The Wikipedia article that says: "British English is the form of English used in the United Kingdom. It includes all English dialects used within the United Kingdom." is simply using the non-technical term "form" to refer to the grouping of all dialects of English found in the United Kingdom. As for the Wikipedia article on Singapore English, I can't see where it says that "'Standard Singapore English' is not a dialect, but a form of English". It does say that Singapore Standard English is very similar to standard British English (which I assume refers to RP). Singapore Colloquial English (aka Singlish) on the other hand, while based largely on English (as well as on the other languages of Singapore) is so different from English that it is not usually considered a dialect of English (ie it is not mutually intelligible with any other dialect of English) but a creole. So in short, referring to a "form" of a language is a non-technical usage that could cover any variety, or grouping of varieties, of a language (ie dialects, idiolects, registers, genres, jargons, etc). But the term "dialect" is a technical term within linguistics. 

While a relatively rare phenomenon, there are numerous examples of languages where the selection of a pronoun depends on the TAM of the clause (I say 'clause' as it is not always the case that it is also marked on the verb). In Pitta-Pitta (Australian family) all core case-marking is split according to whether it marks future or non-future and this also applies to pronouns. (1a) and (1b) show non-future and future examples respectively: 

The codes: \lx = headword (this would also indicate start of a new entry), \pos = part of speech, \def = definition, \syn = synonym, \xv = vernacular example, \xe = english gloss of example, \so = source. Entries such as this one can have a much more complex structure, including multiple senses. Each sense subentry would begin with a line such as \se1 (for the first sense), followed by its own \def, \syn, etc lines within the entry, as appropriate. There is a variety of software that can take a regularly-structured FOSF lexical database and convert it into a nicely formatted dictionary. One easy to use software to do this that is currently popular is Lexique Pro, although ToolBox and FLEx can also do this conversion. 

Words in different part of speech (POS) categories are considered different words even if they have the same form. Thus /bank/ (noun) and /bank/ (verb) are different words that simply happen to have the same form. This means, for example that they will each have their own entry in dictionaries. They also seem to function as distinct items in our mental lexicons. Other answers have suggested that this situation may be connected to the lowish amount of morphology in English, but Kastovsky (in Bauer and Valera 2005) argues that this is not correct and gives examples of languages with much more inflectional morphology than English that still have this situation. In English there is a productive process called 'zero-derivation' (or 'conversion') which results in identical forms in different POS categories. This process creates a new word from an old one without any change in form. Thus English speakers regularly use zero-derivation to create new verbs from nouns. Zero-derivation between other part of speech categories also happens, but is less common. Another source of identical forms across multiple POS categories is historical change. English has lost many inflections and this loss has in some cases produced words in different POS categories that have the same form. An example here is 'talk' (noun) and 'talk' (verb). 

There are many software applications for linguistic analysis listed at LinguistList's software page, including lexical analysis tools and, probably what you're after, concordance software (and lots of other fun stuff too). Most are free. I suspect that the first one in the list, 'Simple concordance program' will do what you want. Additional: here's an even better list of text analysis tools.
